The SBU said the men had told interrogators they were experienced army soldiers, and one said he was sent to Russia for training, not fighting.\n\nBut Kyiv did not present direct evidence that the captured men were North Korean and AFP was unable to independently verify their nationalities. South Korea’s confirmation added weight to Kyiv’s account.\n\nThe NIS similarly said one of the captured soldiers revealed during his interrogation that he received military training from Russian forces after arriving there in November. “He initially believed he was being sent for training, realising upon arrival in Russia that he had been deployed,” the NIS said.\n\nThe soldier said North Korean forces had experienced “significant losses during battle”. According to Seoul’s intelligence agency, one of the men “went without food or water for four to five days before being captured”.\n\nThe NIS said it would continue to work with the SBU to share information on North Korean fighters in Ukraine.\n\nNeither Russia nor North Korea have reacted to the intelligence accounts.\n\nRussia and North Korea have boosted their military ties since Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, though neither has confirmed that Pyongyang’s forces are fighting for Moscow.\n\nOn a visit to Seoul this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Washington believed Russia was expanding space cooperation with North Korea in exchange for its troop contribution in fighting Ukraine.\n\n“The DPRK is already receiving Russian military equipment and training. Now we have reason to believe that Moscow intends to share advanced space and satellite technology with Pyongyang,” Blinken told a news conference in Seoul, using the North’s official name.\n\nRepeating an assertion recently made by the US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, Blinken said the US also believed that Russia “may be close” to formally accepting North Korea’s status as a nuclear power.\n\nThe assertion came as North Korea test-fired a new hypersonic missile while Blinken was visiting the US ally.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last month that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been “killed or wounded” fighting for Russia, while Seoul put the figure at 1,000.\n\nThe NIS told the country’s lawmakers last month that “several North Korean casualties” had already been attributed to Ukrainian missile and drone attacks as well as training accidents, with the highest ranking “at least at the level of a general”.\n\nDue to losses among its forces, North Korea is preparing for additional deployment to Ukraine, according to Seoul’s military.\n\nSouth Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said last month that Pyongyang is reportedly “preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers” to aid Russia’s war effort.\n\nPyongyang and Moscow have deepened political, military and cultural ties since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nIn a New Year’s letter, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un hailed Russian President Vladimir Putin and made a possible reference to the war in Ukraine. He said 2025 would be the year “when the Russian army and people defeat neo-Nazism and achieve a great victory”.",
