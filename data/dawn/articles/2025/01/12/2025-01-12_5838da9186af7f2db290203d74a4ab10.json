Once he fell asleep, she called the co-accused, who arrived at the house and used a wire to electrocute and strangle him.\n\nAccording to state prosecutor Syed Athar Hussain, the complainant informed the police that on November 5, 2019, he received a call from his cousin, who told him that Shah Zaman had died of an electric shock and that his body was being taken to Jacobabad.\n\nHowever, upon inspecting the body, the complainant noticed scars on the wrists, chest, feet, ankles, and neck of the deceased. He then decided to shift the body to Karachi for a post-mortem at the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital. The post-mortem report confirmed that the deceased had died due to “strangulation and electric shock”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
