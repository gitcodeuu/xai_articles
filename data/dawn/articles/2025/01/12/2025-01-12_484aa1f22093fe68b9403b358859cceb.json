We have seen in the past that martial law regimes have had the longest tenures,” he said. “The real question is whether this government can claim that it came to power through fair elections and holds a genuine mandate with moral and legal authority.”\n\nHighlighting irregularities in recent by-elections in two Balochistan Assem­bly constituencies, Mau­la­­na Fazl said, “In one constituency, Nadra verified only two per cent of the vo­­­tes as genuine. In an­­ot­her, a candidate was decl­ared victorious despite not winning a single polling station. How can we trust such elections.”\n\nHe criticised the establishment for its refusal to change its attitude, accusing it of having no ideology beyond a “thirst for authority”. He added, “They may get angry over criticism, but when they mock democracy in this way, how can they expect not to face public backlash?”\n\nTo a question, the JUI-F chief said the legislation for the registration of madressahs has already been enacted at the parliamentary level and asked why provincial governments are delaying legislation when a national law is already in place.\n\nHe called for immediate implementation throu­­gh provincial laws. He also mentioned that relief had been provided for ma­­dressah registration thro­ugh a presidential ordinance and clarified that JUI-F had no objections to the government’s efforts to bring certain madressahs under its control.\n\nOn economic issues, he stressed that the public would remain dissatisfied until the common man felt the effects of economic progress.\n\nHe also noted that the PTI had not taken the public into confidence regarding its ongoing negotiations with the governme­nt, so he refrained from commenting on the matter.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
