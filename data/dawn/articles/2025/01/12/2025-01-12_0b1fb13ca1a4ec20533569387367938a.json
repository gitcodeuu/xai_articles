While other provinces and the federal government failed in implementing public-private partnerships effectively, Sindh’s success had earned international acclaim, he noted.\n\nThe PPP chairman urged the business community across Karachi and the country to participate in Sindh government’s public-private partnership projects. He also urged the federal government to follow Sindh’s example and introduce attractive development initiatives to involve the national business community.\n\nPraises contribution of PPP to city uplift\n\nHe praised the enduring contributions of the PPP and his family’s three generations to the development of the city and said that the city’s advancement was vital for the nation’s overall progress and prosperity.\n\nHe highlighted the achievements of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who initiated big projects such as Sharea Faisal and Pakistan Steel Mills during his tenure.\n\nThe PPP chairman said that Benazir Bhutto, despite facing two dictatorial regimes, prioritised infrastructure, employment opportunities, and essential facilities for the people. “During her government, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto paid special attention to Karachi, striving for peace and employment for the city’s residents,” he said, adding that his mission was also to ensure public progress and carry forward her vision.\n\nHe also praised President Asif Zardari’s initiatives for Karachi, saying, “Ask former Mayor Mustafa Kamal, and he will confirm that President Asif Ali Zardari provided the most funds for Sindh.”\n\nHe said that the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Expressway project would not only connect the city and the province to the rest of the country but also create employment opportunities for the residents.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, the chief minister described the Malir Expressway as the largest public-private partnership infrastructure project in the province and the country.\n\nHe explained that the project’s total cost is approximately Rs55 billion, with the Sindh government contributing around Rs32bn. Commercial banks, development finance institutions, and the public-private partnership had jointly funded the remaining Rs23bn.\n\nCM Shah further emphasised that once the expressway is fully operational by June 2025, it would provide faster and more efficient access to industrial zones, and boost the economic activity in the region.\n\nAfter completion, the Malir Expressway will serve as an alternative route to Sharea Faisal and link to the Karachi-Hyderabad Motorway (M-9) near Kathore, significantly reducing the traffic burden on Karachi’s congested urban roads.\n\nThe event was attended among others by PPP-Sindh President Nisar Ahmed Khuhro, former CM Syed Qaim Ali Shah, Mayor Murtaza Wahab, business leaders Arif Habib, Aqeel Karim Dhedhi, M. Ali Tabba, Zubair Motiwala, Javed Balwani and others.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
