The incompetent pols (politicians) have no idea how to put them out,” Trump said on his Truth Social platform.\n\n“This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can’t put out the fires. What’s wrong with them?” he wrote.\n\nThe speed and intensity of the blazes ravaging Los Angeles have tested its firefighting infrastructure and given rise to questions and criticism about the state’s preparedness.\n\nHydrants ran dry in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood as it was ravaged by one of the region’s five separate fires, while water shortages additionally hampered efforts elsewhere.\n\nWith just over a week before he returns to the White House, Trump has launched a series of evidence-free broadsides accusing California’s Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of failings in response to the blazes.\n\nNewsom has meanwhile invited Trump to visit Los Angeles and survey the devastation with him.\n\nThe fires have so far killed at least 16 people, displaced 150,000 more, and destroyed more than 12,000 structures according to state officials . “Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place,” Trump said in his post.\n\nDespite firefighters’ heroic efforts, including precision sorties from aerial crews, the Palisades Fire has continued to push east towards the priceless collections of the Getty Center art museum and north to the densely populated San Fernando Valley.",
