  "content": "BATTAGRAM: Residents on Saturday urged the government to construct a bypass to alleviate persistent traffic congestion on the main road through the Battagram city that has become a daily nuisance for commuters and pedestrians.\n\nThe current narrow road, exacerbated by illegal car parking and encroachments has resulted in chronic traffic jams that not only frustrate commuters but also pose risk to minors who have been hit by vehicles on several occasions.\n\nThe main bazaar’s single road is woefully inadequate, serving as the primary route for accessing markets, DHQ and private hospitals, banks, police lines, city police station, government offices, district administration and judiciary.\n\nResidents and traders urged the government to expand the existing road and construct a bypass to minimise traffic flow. This would not only ease congestion but also provide a safe passage for tourists and commuters traveling to Gilgit, Skardu and other areas.\n\nThey also call for crackdown on illegal parking, structures\n\nThe residents said it had become almost impossible for women and children to walk in the main bazaar.\n\nShaukat Hayat, Chapargram village council chairman, pointed out that the situation was previously manageable, but the increased number of vehicles exacerbated the problem. “As the road has not been expanded, people are regularly stuck in the main bazaar, causing them inconvenience.”\n\nInayat Khan, a resident of Battagram village, criticised the authorities for lacking a comprehensive development plan for the district. “Politicians and administrators act according to the need of the hour, without considering the long-term consequences.”\n\n“Whenever there is an emergency situation it becomes almost impossible for Rescue 1122 officials to move their heavy machinery for firefighting or dragging out vehicles from deep ravines,” the villager said.\n\nHashim Khan, a resident of Ajmera village, deplored the apathy of political leaders and local administration, stating that the main Karakoram Highway was the only route for light and heavy traffic to commute through the main bazaar. “Heavy-loaded trucks, buses and other vehicles pass through the bazaar all day and night, causing severe traffic congestion, even ambulances while carrying serious patients get stuck in traffic. If the government constructs another road outside the bazaar, it will significantly minimise traffic rush through the bazaar.”\n\nAnwar Khan of Battagram union council noted that there was no space for pedestrians to walk along the roadside. “Traders have also occupied the front spaces of their shops, displaying their items and contributing to the traffic jam. The government needs to take action against encroachers and clear the road for smooth traffic. However, this is not a permanent solution, and the government must construct a bypass.”\n\nResident Javed Iqbal Khan said roads were a sign of a country’s development and discipline. “The chaotic traffic situation portrays a bad image of Pakistan in front of foreigners, who use the main Karakoram Highway to travel to Gilgit, Skardu and other areas. Many times, the severe traffic congestion disappoints tourists and makes their journey unpleasant. The government should construct a bypass to facilitate tourists and commuters.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
