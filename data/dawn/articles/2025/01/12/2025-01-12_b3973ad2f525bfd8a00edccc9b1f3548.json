  "content": "Joshua Zirkzee scored the winning penalty for 10-man Manchester United against Arsenal after their hectic FA Cup third-round tie finished 1-1 after extra time at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday.\n\nArsenal’s Kai Havertz was the only one of the first four penalty takers to miss, denied by a brilliant stop from Altay Bayindir before Zirkzee, booed off in a defeat by Newcastle United last month, stepped up to win the shootout 5-3.\n\nAfter an underwhelming first half, United took the lead in the 52nd minute through Bruno Fernandes’ curling effort from just inside the box after a great run by Alejandro Garnacho.\n\nThe game turned on its head 10 minutes later though, as United’s Diogo Dalot already booked for a wild challenge on Myles Lewis-Skelly received a second yellow card for a reckless tackle on Mikel Merino.\n\nTwo minutes later, Bayindir’s poor attempted punch fell at the feet of Gabriel, whose shot took a wicked deflection off Matthijs de Ligt and in to put the Gunners in charge of the tie.\n\nArsenal could have completed the comeback when they were awarded a questionable penalty after Havertz went down under minimal contact from Harry Maguire.\n\nBut Bayindir produced a superb save from Arsenal captain Martin Odegaard before the Gunners spurned several chances to score a winner.\n\nUnited will find out their opponent in the fourth round when the draw is made later on Sunday evening.",
