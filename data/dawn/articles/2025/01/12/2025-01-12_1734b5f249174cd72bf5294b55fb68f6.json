The victim also picked out Tariq Shah and told the magistrate that he had interrogated him during captivity.\n\nA couple of days ago, two constables of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) among eight suspects were booked and arrested for their alleged involvement in the kidnapping of the trader and releasing him after he transferred the ransom into their digital wallets.\n\nEarlier, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) had remanded the eight suspects in police custody as the IO informed the court that their absconding accomplices —Hamad, Zaman, Muzamil, Ali Raza, Rasheed Lodhi, and others — had yet to be arrested.\n\nA case was registered at the Manghopir police station against eight suspects under Sections 365-A (kidnapping or abducting for extorting property, valuable security) and 34 (common intention) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1997.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
