Proper ventilation should be ensured in the rooms and kitchen and consumers should ensure that all gas-powered appliances, including stoves, geysers and heaters are turned off properly.”\n\nHe urged citizens to contact the nearest office of the gas utility by dialling emergency number 1199 in case of gas leakage.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
