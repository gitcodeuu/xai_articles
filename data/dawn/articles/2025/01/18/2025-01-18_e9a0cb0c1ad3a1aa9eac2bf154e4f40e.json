  "content": "A seven-year-old boy who had been missing for over a week in Karachi was found dead in the underground water tank of a residential complex near his home on Saturday with a police surgeon suggesting the death was not accidental as the body bore multiple injuries.\n\nIn the past few days, three children have been abducted from the city and the incidents have created an environment of fear and insecurity among the citizens, prompting the Sindh chief minister and home minister to take notice of the kidnappings.\n\nOn January 7, seven-year-old Mohammed Sarim, who had gone to a madressah for lessons near his North Karachi home, went missing and a ransom call had reportedly been made to the family for his release. The Sindh governor had assured Sarim’s mother on Thursday that her son would be recovered “very soon”.\n\nHowever, a statement from the Bilal Colony police today said that Sarim’s body was recovered from a water tank at Anam Apartments in New Karachi.\n\nCentral Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn.com that on the day the boy went missing, police and the victim’s family had searched the same tank but could not find him due to the large quantity of water.\n\n“For the past two to three days, there was no water supply,” Shafiq said. “The plumber said today that a bad smell was emanating from the tank. The body was found floating in it.”\n\nThe body was taken to Abbasi Shaheed Hospital (ASH) for a postmortem report and further investigation is underway, the SSP added.\n\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the body was received by the Medicolegal Section at ASH for a postmortem.\n\n“He had been missing since January 7,” Dr Syed said. “[The] postmortem has been carried out and multiple injuries have been noted. All relevant swabs and samples have been collected.”\n\nShe added that a conclusive opinion and cause of death “will be issued after reports”.\n\nWhen asked if the incident was a homicide, Dr Syed replied, “At present, all I can say is that the presence of multiple injuries on the body, including the neck, suggests that it is not an accidental death.”\n\nMeanwhile, West Deputy Inspector General (DIG) of Police Irfan Ali Baloch said presently the police could not categorically call it a murder since they were still waiting for the final medical report.\n\nHe said investigators asked four specific questions from the doctors and were waiting for their reply, adding that the questions pertained to whether the boy was tortured and subjected to sodomy, the time of death and whether there were strangulation marks.\n\nDIG Baloch said the matter would be clarified after the report, adding that the doctors had not told the police in clear terms that it was a murder.\n\nThe DIG said Sarim lived in the same apartment whose underground water tank was not properly covered and the child could have fallen in it while playing.\n\nAccording to an August report by Sahil, a non-governmental organisation working for children’s rights, a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported across the country in 2024.\n\nIn the first six months of 2024, 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages were reported.\n\nThe six-monthly data showed that out of the total reported cases, (962) 59 per cent of victims were girls while (668) 41pc were boys.\n\nSeparately, the police claimed to have made some progress in the case of two missing boys from Garden.\n\n“I have constituted a special investigation team comprising two SSPs and two DSPs,” South DIG Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com.\n\nHe added that “two suspects have been identified in facial recognition system and leads are being developed to arrest them.”\n\nThe two children — five-year-old Aliyan, aka Ali, and six-year-old Ali Raza — were playing on Siddique Wahab Road in Garden West when a couple riding a motorcycle took them away on Tuesday around 1:30pm.",
