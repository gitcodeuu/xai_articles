As per reports, 44 out of a total of 65 Pakistani immigrants on board the ship either drowned or died after alleged torture, while 10 bodies have been recovered. At least 19 others survived, according to media reports.\n\nThe survivors and the bodies are currently in Dakhla, a small town near the coast of Morocco.\n\nFM Dar reviewed the incident in detail while chairing a meeting today on issues relating to third-country relocations of Afghan nationals. He also issued instructions regarding coordination of the government’s response to the incident.\n\nThe secretaries of the foreign and interior ministries and other officials attended the meeting.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to send an official team to Moro­cco, sources had told Dawn, adding that the team comprised Federal Investi­gation Age­ncy (FIA) Addi­tional Dire­ctor General (north) Mun­eer Maarth, Additional Secretary Int­erior Salman Chau­dhary and representatives from the foreign ministry and Intelligence Bureau.\n\nThey said the officials would visit the Moroccan capital of Rabat and Dakhla, where they would assess the situation and compile a detailed report, which would be submitted to the prime minister.\n\nMeanwhile, FIA registered three cases against suspects involved in sending the intending immigrants abroad illegally. The cases were lodged against the human traffickers of Gujrat and Sialkot districts with FIA crime circles in Gujranwala and Gujrat.\n\nThe victims also belonged to the Sialkot and Mandi Bahauddin districts.",
