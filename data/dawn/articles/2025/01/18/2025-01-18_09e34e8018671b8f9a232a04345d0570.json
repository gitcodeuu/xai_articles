He said the KDA had requested the provincial government to release a Rs3 billion grant.\n\nHe said the provincial government had been paying a sum of Rs400m to the KDA for the payment of salaries and pensions of its employees.\n\nHe said the provincial cabinet had approved a grant of Rs500m for the Hyderabad Development Authority.\n\nThe minister said the dues of the retired employees of the SBCA had been paid, while a sum of Rs5.1bn was payable to the staffers of the KWSC from July 2020 to Dec 2024.\n\nAnswering another call attention notice moved by MQM-P’s Amir Siddiqui on the unsatisfactory sanitation situation in Jamshed Town and adjacent areas in the city, the LG minister conceded that the services of the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board had been affected in all towns of Karachi’s District East.\n\nHe said the sanitation contract for district East with the Chinese company had expired. He said the contract couldn’t be renewed because the foreign company in question was keen to receive its payments in dollars only, instead of rupees.\n\nHe said that other sanitation companies had agreed to receive their payments in the local currency.\n\nBRT lines to have cycling lanes: minister\n\nFurnishing statement and replies of lawmakers, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon, who also holds the portfolio of transport, said the Sindh government had implemented significant initiatives to enhance public transportation infrastructure in the city.\n\nHe said the Peoples Bus Service (PBS), launched in 2022, operated 250 state-of-art diesel-electric buses, including 28 pink buses exclusively for women.\n\nHe said that the PBS was serving approximately 100,000 passengers daily on 10 routes.\n\nIn reply to a question by MQM-P’s Dr Fouzia Hameed, the transport minister said that the pedestrian paths and cycling lanes were included in the scope of work of Bus Rapid Transit Yellow Line and BRT Red Line along the corridors.\n\n“The BRT Red Line has a dedicated cycle track with pedestrian friendly walkways throughout the 22-km corridor,” he added.\n\nEarlier, Speaker Syed Awais Qadir Shah started the proceedings without any delay at 10am to find only two members on the treasury benches and six on opposition benches.\n\nLater, three dozen more members from the two sides of the aisle joined the sitting.\n\nThe house was adjourned to Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2025",
