Around 200 students are enrolled in the campus, one of the faculty members told Dawn, adding that 130 boys and 70 girls were enrolled in two disciplines — BS Islamic Studies and BS Management.\n\nHe added that boys and girls staying in the hostels belonged to far-flung areas of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Punjab.\n\nThe faculty member, who did not want to be named, said most of the students living in the hostel got free education while the mess expenses of around 60 of them were being borne by philanthropists.\n\nAccording to some teachers, the students were anxious about the future of the institute in the wake of the verdict.\n\nContrary to some media reports, the campus is not an autonomous university.\n\nThe Jhelum deputy director of colleges, Dr Habibur Rehman, said that Al-Qadir University Trust was registered with the Directorate of Public Instructions (DPI) Colleges in Punjab as a graduate college and was affiliated with Government College University (GCU) Lahore.\n\nWhen asked about any plan to take over the control of the institution, as envisaged in the verdict, the officer stated that “we have not received any such directions from higher authorities as yet. As the government will direct, we will follow”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2025",
