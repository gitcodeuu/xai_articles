  "content": "FRANKFURT: A man clung on to the outside of a German high-speed train, surviving unscathed as it barrelled along at up to 282 kilometres an hour.\n\nThe 40-year-old Hungarian man was taking a cigarette break at a platform in Bavaria when the train doors slammed shut, prompting him to jump onto the bracket between two carriages.\n\nThe unidentified man later told police he opted for the daredevil act because his luggage was still onboard the train headed cross-country from Munich to Luebeck.\n\nHe spent the next 30 kilometres gripping onto cables before the train was brought to a controlled stop after witnesses had spotted the stowaway and alerted authorities.\n\nThe man had boarded the train in the southern city of Munich, but took the smoke break in Ingolstadt. Police arrested him in the Bavarian town of Kinding before the train continued north.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 18th, 2025",
