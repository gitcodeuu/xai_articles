  "content": "Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported.\n\n“Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred,” the judiciary’s Mizan Online website reported, adding that the “assailant killed himself”.\n\nState news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack.\n\nMizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases “fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism”.\n\nThe motive behind their killing was not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker’s identity. Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added.\n\nVeteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having “overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded”, according to the US Department of the Treasury.\n\nRazini, 71, held several important positions in Iran’s judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants “who planted a magnetic bomb in his vehicle”, according to Mizan.\n\nThough attacks targeting judges are rare, Iran has seen a number of shootings targeting high-profile figures over the past years.\n\nIn October, a Shia Muslim preacher was shot dead in the southern city of Kazeroun after leading Friday prayers.\n\nIn April 2023, a powerful cleric identified as Abbas Ali Soleimani was also shot dead at a bank in the northern province of Mazandaran.\n\nAnd in August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran.\n\nTwo men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later.",
