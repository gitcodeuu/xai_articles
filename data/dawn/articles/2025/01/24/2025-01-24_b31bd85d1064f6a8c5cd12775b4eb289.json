  "content": "MOSCOW: The Kremlin said on Thursday it saw nothing new in US President Donald Trump’s calls for Russia to end its military offensive in Ukraine, and that Moscow was ready for “mutually respectful” dialogue with him.\n\nThe US leader had on Wednesday threatened fresh sanctions on Moscow if Russia did not strike a deal to end its nearly three-year campaign against Ukraine.\n\nExpectations are high that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump will soon hold a phone call to discuss the conflict, after the Republican pledged on the campaign trail to bring a swift end to the fighting.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was “ready for equal, mutually respectful dialogue.” “We are waiting for signals, which we have not yet received,” he added.\n\nTrump has not said publicly how he sees the contours of a potential peace deal between Kyiv and Moscow. Putin has outlined maximalist demands that include the Ukrainian withdrawal from parts of its own territory still under Kyiv’s control.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has meanwhile ruled out territorial concessions, though has said he would consider trying to secure the return of land captured by Russia through “diplomatic” means.\n\nKyiv is also demanding security guarantees from Nato and the United States along with the deployment of Western, including American, peacekeeping troops.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, Trump on Wednesday told Putin to make a deal “now” and threatened “high levels of Taxes, Tariffs, and Sanctions” on Moscow. Trump said he was “not looking to hurt Russia” and had “always had a very good relationship with President Putin,” a leader for whom he has expressed admiration in the past.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2025",
