  "content": "WASHINGTON: The gesture was controversial enough, but now come the sub-controversies: Elon Musk is trolling Wikipedia and encouraging its defunding after a description of his recent flourish, seen by some as a Hitler salute, appeared on the encyclopedic website.\n\nThe fight pits two of the internet’s best-known tech giants against each other — and highlights the starkly different ethos behind Musk’s X social media site and Wikipedia, founded by American entrepreneur Jimmy Wales.\n\nMusk, as the majority owner of X, is behind recent easing of content moderation rules, which has allowed for rampant disinformation across his social media platform, while simultaneously positioning himself as President Donald Trump’s right-hand man.\n\nWhile Musk’s animosity towards Wikipedia may focus outwardly on the hand gesture, Wikipedia’s goal of factual neutrality makes it a natural adversary to X, a platform increasingly synonymous with heated culture wars, hate speech and disinformation.\n\nWikipedia and the media at large — which Musk has increasingly criticised — also pose a threat by holding him accountable as he thrusts himself into the centre of US politics.\n\nIn a December interview with New York magazine’sIntelligencer, Wales said the aim at Wikipedia is for editors to create content that is “clear and acknowledges the different viewpoints out there” even amid “the rise in divisive feelings, partisanship, culture wars, all of that.”\n\nAt present, the site is regarded as generally reliable despite being written by a community of volunteers.\n\nThe dustup between Musk and Wales began after the billionaire raised eyebrows on Monday with his gesticulation at a Trump inauguration event. Thanking a crowd for returning Trump to the White House, Musk tapped the left side of his chest with his right hand and then extended his arm with his palm open. He then turned around to the crowd behind him and did it again.\n\nAs of Wednesday, both Musk’s biographical Wikipedia page as well as the page on the “Nazi salute” mention the episode.\n\n‘Defund’ Wikipedia\n\nOn Tuesday, Musk reposted what appeared to be part of that Wikipedia entry, although the wording found on Wikipedia as of Wednesday was slightly different.\n\nThe reposted text read: “In his speech during the second Trump inauguration, Musk twice extended his right arm towards the crowd in an upward angle. The gesture was compared to a Nazi salute or fascist salute. Musk denied any meaning behind the gesture.”\n\nAlongside the repost, Musk attacked both Wikipedia and the news media, another favorite target, suggesting that each is a purveyor of disinformation. “Since legacy media propaganda is considered a ‘valid’ source by Wikipedia, it naturally simply becomes an extension of legacy media propaganda!” Musk wrote.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2025",
