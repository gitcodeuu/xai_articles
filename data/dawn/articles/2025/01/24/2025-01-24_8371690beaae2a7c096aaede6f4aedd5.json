  "content": "KARACHI: The foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) declined $276 million to $11.448 billion during the week ended on Jan 17 due to external debt repayments, reported the central bank on Thursday.\n\nFinance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb said in Davos that Pakis­tan had agreed terms for a $1bn loan with two Middle Eastern banks at 6 to 7pc interest rate.\n\nThe country is in a problematic situation regarding debt servicing despite the rollover of loans by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The country’s economic team desperately struggles to secure a debt rollover from China.\n\nMr Aurangzeb said it would be a short-term loan from the two Middle Eastern banks. However, borrowing at commercial rates would further bring the country’s external account under pressure.\n\nBesides, the profit repatriation by multinationals surged 114pc to $1.215bn during the first six mon­ths of the current fiscal FY25 against $568m in the same period of last year.\n\nThe country’s overall reserves fell by $261m to $16.189bn, including the commercial bank’s holdings, which rose by $14m to $4.70bn during the week under review.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2025",
