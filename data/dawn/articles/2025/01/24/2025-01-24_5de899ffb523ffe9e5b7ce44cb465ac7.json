Before the imposition of penalty, he was offered an opportunity to defend himself through a video link,” the spokesperson said.\n\nKeeping in view the entire case, the Chief Human Resource Officer dismissed him from his service with immediate effect. He was also directed to surrender his PIA ID card, family card and airport pass. The PIA spokesman said that the national flag carrier will not tolerate any violation of the law.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Airport Authority (PAA) has taken note of stray dog sightings in the landside area of the Jinnah International Airport (JIAP), Karachi.\n\nThe authority was reportedly alarmed by a video circulating on social media and reported by the mainstream media.\n\nA spokesperson for the PAA said in a statement on Thursday that the airport spans 3,700 acres and the landside area, unlike the fully secured and fenced airside, is an open zone surrounded by densely populated neighbourhoods. These neighbourhoods include eateries and other establishments that often attract stray dogs, he said.\n\n“Despite regular cleaning of garbage pits under PAA’s jurisdiction, the presence of stray dogs in adjacent areas remains a challenge.” The airside, where main flight operations occur, is completely secured with robust fencing and monitored 24/7 by specialised teams to prevent any possible intrusion, he said.\n\nTo mitigate the risk on the landside, PAA has contacted the Edhi Foundation to help manage stray dogs and has written to the local administration, urging them to intensify efforts to keep stray dogs away from airport premises.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2025",
