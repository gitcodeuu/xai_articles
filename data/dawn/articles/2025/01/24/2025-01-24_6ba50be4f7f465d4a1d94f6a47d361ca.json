It is undoubtedly Pakistan’s gateway to regional and global trade,” he said.\n\nHe emphasised the strategic importance of Gwadar Port as the cornerstone of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and underscored Baloc­h­istan’s abundant resources, including the Reko Diq copper-gold reserves, chromite, marble, and vast natural gas deposits, as unmatched opportunities for global investors.\n\nCM Bugti also shed light on the province’s agriculture and fisheries sectors, which are ripe for investment.\n\n“Balochistan produces high-quality dates, apples, pomegranates, and grapes, while its coastal areas offer vast prospects for fisheries and aquaculture,” he said.\n\nTo facilitate investment, he pointed out the establishment of special economic zones like the Gwadar Free Zone, offering tax exemptions, duty-free machinery imports, and other investor-friendly incentives.\n\nHe also mentioned the government’s focus on infrastructure development to connect markets and communities, thereby fostering economic growth.\n\n“Development is not just about economic growth but about bringing positive changes in people’s lives,” he remarked. The provincial government, he said, is prioritising education, healthcare, and employment while ensuring local communities are integrated into development projects to share the benefits equitably.\n\nInviting global investors, CM Bugti stated: “Balochistan stands on the threshold of a new era of progress. Leveraging these investment opportunities can pave the way for development not only in Balochistan but across Pakistan and for the global community.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2025",
