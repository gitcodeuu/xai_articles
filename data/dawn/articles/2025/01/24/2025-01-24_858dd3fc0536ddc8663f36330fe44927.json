  "content": "PARIS: Solar overtook coal in the European Union’s electricity production in 2024, with the share of renewables rising to almost half the bloc’s power sector, according to a report released on Thursday.\n\nGas generation, meanwhile, declined for the fifth year in a row and fossil-fuelled power dipped to a “historic low”, climate think tank Ember said in its European Electricity Review 2025.\n\n“The European Green Deal has delivered a deep and rapid transformation of the EU power sector,” the think tank said.\n\n“Solar remained the EU’s fastest-growing power source in 2024, rising above coal for the first time. Wind power remained the EU’s second-largest power source, above gas and below nuclear.”\n\nOverall, strong growth in solar and wind have boosted the share of renewables to 47 per cent, up from 34pc in 2019. Fossil fuels have fallen from 39 to 29pc.\n\n“A surge in wind and solar generation is the main reason for declining fossil generation. Without wind and solar capacity added since 2019, the EU would have imported 92 billion cubic metres more of fossil gas and 55 million tonnes more of hard coal, costing EUR59 billion,” the report said.\n\nAccording to Ember, these trends are widespread across Europe, with solar power progressing in all EU countries. More than half have now either eliminated coal, the most polluting fossil fuel, or reduced its share to less than 5pc of their energy mix.\n\n“Fossil fuels are losing their grip on EU energy,” said Chris Rosslowe, lead author of the report. “At the start of the European Green Deal in 2019, few thought the EU’s energy transition would be where it is today: wind and solar are relegating coal to the margins and pushing gas into decline.”\n\nBattery storage\n\nBut Rosslowe cautioned much work remains. “We need to accelerate our efforts, particularly in the wind power sector,” he said. Europe’s electricity system will also need to increase its storage capacity to make the most of renewable energies, which are by definition intermittent, he added.\n\nIn 2024, plentiful solar energy helped drive down prices in the middle of the day, sometimes even resulting in “negative or zero price hours” due to an overabundance of supply compared to demand.\n\n“A readily available solution is a battery co-located with a solar plant. This gives solar power producers more control over the prices they receive and helps them avoid selling for low prices in the middle of the day,” the report said.\n\nThe think tank suggested consumers could reduce their bills by shifting usage to periods of abundance (smart electrification), while battery operators could earn revenue from buying power when prices are low and selling it back when demand peaks.\n\nBatteries have advanced significantly in recent years, with installed capacity across the EU doubling to 16 GW in 2023, compared with 8 GW in 2022, according to Ember. But this capacity is concentrated in just a small number of countries: 70pc of existing batteries were located in Germany and Italy at the end of 2023.\n\n“More storage and demand flexibility is needed to sustain growth and for consumers to reap the full benefits of abundant solar,” Ember said. “After a challenging few years for the wind power sector, additions are set to grow, but not by enough to hit EU targets.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2025",
