He also hit three tons and one fifty, while his highest score was 113.\n\nEarlier this month, Ayub was ruled out of competitive cricket for six weeks after the youngster fractured his ankle. However, he will not need surgery and will instead undergo rehab in London, the Pakistan Cricket Board confirmed last week.\n\nPacer Afridi had a “big impact” despite only playing six ODIs in the calendar year. He bagged 15 wickets, had a bowling average of 17.6 and best bowling figures of 4/47.\n\n“Possessing one of world cricket’s best bowling strike rates, he continued to prove himself as one of the most consistent performers at the international level,” ICC said.\n\nRauf finished 2024 “firing on all cylinders” as he took 13 wickets across eight ODIs, with a bowling average of 22.4 and best bowling figures of 5/29.\n\nRauf was also named ICC’s Men’s Player of the Month for November. He capped off with an overall tally of 18 wickets and scooped the monthly award over India’s Jasprit Bumrah and South Africa’s Marco Jansen.\n\nNotably, no Indian players were named in the team which featured three players from Afghanistan, four from Sri Lanka, and one from West Indies, in addition to the Pakistani trio.\n\nSaim Ayub (Pakistan)\n\nRahmanullah Gurbaz (Afghanistan)\n\nPathum Nissanka (Sri Lanka)\n\nKusal Mendis (Sri Lanka)\n\nCharith Asalanka (Sri Lanka)\n\nSherfane Rutherford (West Indies)\n\nAzmatullah Omarzai (Afghanistan)\n\nWanindu Hasaranga (Sri Lanka)\n\nShaheen Afridi (Pakistan)\n\nHaris Rauf (Pakistan)\n\nAM Ghazanfar (Afghanistan)",
