  "content": "KARACHI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf Secretary General Barrister Salman Akram Raja on Thursday vowed that his party would “vigorously” highlight the issues being faced by the people of Karachi and other parts of Sindh at every forum.\n\nHe said that Karachi had given the biggest mandate to the PTI and proved itself as the “powerhouse” for the party.\n\n“That’s the reason that Karachi has been established as the city of Imran Khan’s ideals and it’s our promise that the PTI will vigorously highlight its issues and the problems being faced by the people of other parts of Sindh,” he said while talking to journalists at the PTI city office called Insaf House.\n\nEarlier, the PTI leader held meetings with leaders of the party’s city and Sindh chapters.\n\nAnnounces plans to mobilise party workers in province\n\nMr Raja also outlined the party’s strategy to “revitalise” political activities in Sindh and asserted that in coming weeks the PTI would mobilise its organisation and workers in Karachi and other parts of Sindh.\n\n“Imran Khan is in jail, standing firm like a rock, and he has made his determination very clear that he will remain imprisoned until all PTI workers are released,” he added.\n\n“Imran Khan will not be part of any deal as he believes that much injustice has occurred, and the goal is now within the reach.”\n\nHe termed the Al-Qadir Trust case a false and baseless case, saying that it was a political “hoax” in which the former government had no role.\n\nHe said that Rs460 billion worth of Malir land was to be given to Malik Riaz, and Rs35bn was deposited in the accounts of the Supreme Court. The Al-Qadir University, he said, was a trust and it did not benefit Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi financially.\n\nHe said that economic stability could not be achieved without political stability and reaffirmed the party’s policy to stand with the people and continue its struggle to address the issues faced by the people of Sindh.\n\nIn his remarks, PTI-Sindh president Haleem Adil Sheikh criticised the Pakistan Peoples Party, claiming that the party had deprived the people of basic necessities.\n\nHe said during the PPP’s 17-year rule in Sindh law and order had exacerbated, street crime increased and innocent children were kidnapped. He said that the people of Sindh were looking towards the PTI, stating that this was the last term of the PPP and the future belonged to the PTI.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 24th, 2025",
