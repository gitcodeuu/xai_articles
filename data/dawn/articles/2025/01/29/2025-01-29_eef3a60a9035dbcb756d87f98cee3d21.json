  "content": "ISLAMABAD: While state-owned power distribution companies have sought an over 400 per cent increase in security deposits from consumers, two federal ministers advocated for cheaper electricity rates for industrial consumers and the rationalisation of the ‘disproportionate tax burden’ on the salaried class in the coming months.\n\nAt an event organised by the Pakistan Business Council, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb was of the opinion that the salaried class in the country was facing a “disproportionately high tax burden” that should be eased. He was uncertain about potential changes to tax slabs in the upcoming budget due to the ongoing programme with the IMF. However, he assured that the tax filing system for salaried individuals would be simplified, reducing the need for tax consultants and advisers.\n\nThe finance minister noted that he expected the policy rate to decrease further as inflation continued to fall. He said large businesses were borrowing at interest rates under 11pc, and foreign exchange reserves had improved to $13 billion, sufficient to cover almost three months of imports — key for improving Pakistan’s credit rating.\n\nHe said the budget process had already begun in January and he would be interacting with all sectors, including chambers and trade bodies, next month. Despite this, he emphasised that Pakistan was under a three-year IMF programme, managing business expectations, and reaffirming the government’s commitment to its obligations with international lenders.\n\nPower companies seek 400pc hike in consumers’ security deposits\n\nThe minister said the revenue policy role would be shifted to a unit within the Ministry of Finance so that the FBR could focus on revenue collection. He assured that while the government would facilitate retailers and businesses, it would not compromise on due taxes. He claimed that all economic indicators were moving in the right direction.\n\nPower Minister Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari addressed a long list of power projects that had been committed in violation of the least-cost principle, saying that many of these projects would be scrapped if they had not achieved financial closure. By April, the Central Power Purchasing Agency would stop purchasing electricity from new plants, and surplus capacity would be auctioned off.\n\nMr Leghari said the government would offer electricity to industrial consumers at marginal cost and was considering even cheaper rates for Greenfield projects, especially data centres and IT businesses. He added that the competitive electricity market would be fully operational in two to three years, with gradual implementation starting in April.\n\nHe said the government was reviewing tariff structures for nuclear power plants, Wapda’s hydropower plants, and other public-sector projects, as well as Chinese power producers, in an effort to address circular debt and reduce electricity rates sustainably.\n\nMr Leghari noted that industrial tariffs had already dropped by Rs11 per unit since June 2024. Furthermore, talks were underway on re-profiling Chinese power debt and nationalising debt related to nuclear power plants.\n\nThe minister said a uniform electricity tariff for the entire country was not acceptable or feasible, especially as the government moved toward privatisation. He said that while the deadlines for the privatisation of distribution companies would be kept realistic, eight out of 10 Discos would be in private hands within two-three years.\n\nHe said the government would soon begin talks with the provinces and other stakeholders to phase out the uniform tariff, adding that K-Electric would have been in a much better position without a uniform rate.\n\n400pc increase in security deposits\n\nMeanwhile, power distribution companies, with approval from the power minister, submitted formal applications to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) for up to a 400oc increase in security deposits for electricity consumers in lower slabs.\n\nThey proposed fixing the security deposit at 1pc of the value of assets for houses above 10-marla, and for commercial and industrial consumers. The companies argued that electricity rates had increased by 295pc since 2008, and the increase in security deposits was necessary to safeguard against defaults in consumer bills. They suggested that the security deposit should be equal to 2.5 months of electricity bills, which would raise the per kilowatt deposit from Rs1,220 to Rs5,179, or Rs15,538 for three or 2.5 months’ coverage for homes under 10-marla.\n\nSimilar rates were proposed for higher consumer categories, and the deposit would be equal to 1pc of land value, as determined by the FBR. These new rates would apply to new connections, reconnections, changes in sanctioned load, and changes in name or tariff category. The rates would come into effect after approval from Nepra.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 29th, 2025",
