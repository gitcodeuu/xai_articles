In a ceremony held at the central bank, Governor Jameel Ahmad awarded the licence to Easypaisa Bank Ltd, formerly Telenor Microfinance Bank Ltd, authorising it to commence commercial operations.\n\nThe SBP chief expects the bank to promote innovation, enhance financial inclusion, and ensure the availability of accessible and affordable digital financial services. He underscored the SBP’s strategic role in establishing the framework for digital banking in Pakistan and facilitating the development of digital banks through a structured licencing process.\n\nIn January 2023, the SBP issued NOCs to five applicants — HugoBank, KT Bank Pakistan Ltd, Mashreq Bank Pakistan Ltd, Raqami Islamic Digital Bank Ltd, and Easypaisa Bank Ltd.\n\nIn September 2023, these banks received in-principle approval to prepare for operational readiness.
