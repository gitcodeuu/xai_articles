While statistics for 2024 are not yet available, USAID and other agencies were funding numerous projects in Pakistan.\n\nThe suspension impacts five energy projects, four economic growth initiatives, five agricultural programmes, and several others in education and health in Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, funds for democracy, human rights, and governance have been put on hold pending a review, according to a Dawn report.\n\nOne of the affected projects had received $16 million for early recovery, risk reduction, and resilience (ER4) activities, focusing on strengthening vulnerable populations’ resilience to disasters induced by natural hazards.\n\n“It’s not Pakistan-specific. It’s an executive order affecting all nations, except Egypt and Israel,” a senior Pakistani diplomat said, adding that a suspension order implied that the assistance could resume after a review.\n\nState Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce, writing on X, said, “Urgent needs are being met.”\n\n“Blanket waivers are in place for emergency food and other emergency humanitarian assistance. And a waiver process exists for items not covered by pre-existing waivers,” she wrote.\n\nBruce said that the goal was to get rid of “egregious” funding and programmes not in line with Trump administration priorities.\n\nShe pointed in part to efforts related to assistance on climate change and gender.\n\n“The mandate from the American people was clear — we must refocus on American national interests,” she said.\n\nAid groups and Democratic lawmakers have voiced alarm over potentially far-reaching consequences of the freeze.\n\nThe latest waiver would appear to give the go-ahead for funding for medication under Pepfar, a major US programme against HIV/AIDS.\n\nEstablished in 2003 under former president George W. Bush, Pepfar is credited with saving some 26 million lives.\n\nSpeaking before the latest waiver, ONE, the aid advocacy group co-founded by Irish singer Bono, voiced hope for exemptions but warned that “bureaucratic red tape” could still impact Pepfar funding.\n\n“Our adversaries will capitalise on this gap in US leadership and promote disinformation which will undermine trust in the US and damage our reputation around the world,” said Elizabeth Hoffman, North America executive director at ONE.\n\nIn a separate development, Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday to restrict gender transition procedures for people under the age of 19, in his latest move targeting transgender people since returning to office.\n\nThe order comes the week after Trump said in his inauguration speech that his government would only recognise two genders, male and female, plugging into an issue at the heart of America’s culture wars.\n\n“Across the country today, medical professionals are maiming and sterilising a growing number of impressionable children,” said the order. “This dangerous trend will be a stain on our nation’s history, and it must end.”\n\nTrump’s order said it would now be US policy that it would “not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called ‘transition’ of a child from one sex to another”.\n\nThese included what he called “chemical castration and surgical mutilation” — including puberty blockers, hormones and gender-altering surgery.\n\nIt added that the government would now “rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures.”\n\n“Our Nation will no longer fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support so-called ‘gender affirming care’, which has already ruined far too many precious lives,” the president posted later on his Truth Social platform.\n\nWhile there is no US-wide law against gender-affirming medical treatments for transgender youth, Trump ordered an end to any federal backing for such procedures.\n\nThis includes barring funding for gender transitions under the Medicaid health insurance programme for poor families, the Medicare scheme used by retirees, and under US Defence Department health insurance that covers some 2m children.\n\nTrump said he would also work with Congress to draft legislation to allow children and parents to sue doctors who had carried out gender surgery.\n\nTrump told the Davos forum last week that gender surgery “will occur very rarely” under his administration.\n\nTwo dozen Republican-led states have already enacted laws restricting medical care for gender transitions for minors.\n\nUS Supreme Court justices clashed over the issue in December as they debated a Tennessee law banning puberty blockers or hormone therapy for under 18s.",
