The court also directed that the criminal original case, under which a show-cause notice had been issued to the additional registrar, be annexed with the main case.\n\nDuring the hearing, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned whether the present CB could proceed further in the presence of the Jan 27 order issued by the smaller bench, headed by Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah.\n\nIn response, AGP Awan informed the court that the government intended to challenge the smaller bench’s decision, in which the two-judge bench had assumed jurisdiction over the FBR’s appeal against the SHC judgement. Formal proceedings in this regard are set to commence on Feb 1, he added.\n\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, however, emphasised that concerns about the independence of the judiciary were shared by everyone, not just a select few, and stressed the importance of addressing such matters appropriately.\n\nThe CB also expressed surprise over the smaller bench’s Jan 16 order, which stated that the case should be considered part-heard. “From where has this term come that the matter should be considered part-heard?” Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar wondered.\n\nThe AGP explained that there were two Jan 13 orders: one setting Jan 27 as the next date and another listing the case for Jan 16. This, he said, showed that the date of the case had been changed later.\n\nJustice Mazhar voiced concern, fearing that the smaller bench’s order had unsettled and frightened the judicial staff responsible for providing administrative assistance.\n\nJustice Malik’s note\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Ayesha A. Malik, who had disassociated herself from hearing the Customs Act case, said in a two-page note that as judges, “we must strictly adhere to the distinction between judicial orders and administrative orders and we must preserve and safeguard the sanctity of judicial orders”.\n\n“Most of all we must ensure that our orders are complied with and not overlooked, contravened or evaded by anyone,” Justice Malik said, adding that she would not like to hear these cases in order to protect and preserve the sanctity of the original proceedings and the Jan 16 judicial order.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 29th, 2025",
