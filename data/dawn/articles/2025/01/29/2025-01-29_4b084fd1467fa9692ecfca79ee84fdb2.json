  "content": "NEW DELHI: Microsoft-backed OpenAI sought to block on Tuesday India’s biggest media organisations, including those of billionaires Gautam Adani and Mukesh Ambani, from joining a copyright lawsuit that is set to shape the legal framework for AI in India.\n\nCourts globally are hearing cases from authors, news organisations and musicians who accuse technology firms of using their copyrighted work to train artificial intelligence services without permission or license. India is OpenAI’s second-largest market by number of users, after the United States.\n\nIn India, the case began with legal action last year by local news agency ANI, and in recent weeks book publishers and almost a dozen digital media outlets, including those owned by Adani and Ambani, have sought to join the case to challenge the AI giant.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, agency reported OpenAI had in a filing sought to dismiss the book publisher’s case, saying its ChatGPT service only disseminates public information.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 29th, 2025",
