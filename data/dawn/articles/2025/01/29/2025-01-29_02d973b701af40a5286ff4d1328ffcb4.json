  "content": "DHAKA: Reprisals against journalists and indiscriminate arrests risk undermining Bangladesh’s once-in-a-generation opportunity to end the legal abuses seen under ousted premier Sheikh Hasina, Human Rights Watch warned on Tuesday.\n\nSheikh Hasina fled into exile in August after a student-led revolution ended her 15 years of autocratic rule, capping an uprising that claimed hundreds of lives.\n\nAn interim government led by Nobel Peace Prize laureate Muhammad Yunus took charge days later, pledging to institute far-reaching democratic reforms and stage fresh elections.\n\nIn its report, HRW said Mr Yunus’s administration had begun the process of reforming degraded institutions used as tools to persecute opponents of Hasina’s Awami League.\n\nBut the watchdog’s Asia director Elaine Pearson warned “this hard-won progress could all be lost if the interim government does not implement swift and structural reforms”.\n\nThe report said that police had “returned to the abusive practices that characterised the previous government” to target Hasina’s supporters, filing charges against tens of thousands of people in the two months after Hasina’s ouster.\n\nIt said family members of those killed by security forces in the protests that toppled her government had been pressured into signing case documents without knowing who was being accused in their murder.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 29th, 2025",
