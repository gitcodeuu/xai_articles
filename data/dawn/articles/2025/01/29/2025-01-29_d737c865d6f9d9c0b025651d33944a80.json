The only exceptions are for emergency humanitarian food assistance and for officials returning to their duty stations.\n\n“It’s not Pakistan-specific. It’s an executive order affecting all nations, except Egypt and Israel,” a senior Pakistani diplomat told Dawn, adding that a suspension order implied that the assistance could resume after a review.\n\nHowever, people employed in USAID-funded projects in Islamabad also confirmed the receipt of stop-work orders, some of which have resulted in furloughs and terminations.\n\n“My new award from the State Department to help Pakistan grapple with air pollution and climate change is no more, thanks to this new administration,” scholar Dr Gabriel Filippelli lamented in a tweet following the suspension order.\n\nStop-work orders\n\nHours after taking office, Trump had ordered a 90-day pause in foreign aid to review if it was aligned with his foreign policy priorities. Last week, the State Department issued a stop-work order worldwide even for existing assistance.\n\nWhile military financing waivers have been granted to Israel and Egypt, no such exceptions were made for Pakistan.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, the US disbursed $72 billion in assistance and provided 42pc of all humanitarian aid tracked by the UN in 2024. This included $231 million to Pakistan, $440 million to Bangladesh, $1 billion to Afghanistan, and $175 million to India.\n\nWhile statistics for 2024 are not yet available, USAID and other agencies were funding numerous projects in Pakistan.\n\nThe suspension impacts five energy projects, four economic growth initiatives, five agricultural programs, and several others in education and health in Pakistan.\n\nAdditionally, funds for democracy, human rights, and governance have been put on hold pending a review.\n\nOne of the affected projects had received $16 million for early recovery, risk reduction, and resilience (ER4) activities, focusing on strengthening vulnerable populations’ resilience to disasters induced by natural hazards.\n\nThe suspension could also have a devastating impact on Afghanistan. The head of the World Food Programme (WFP) in Afghanistan told reporters earlier this week that the agency could only feed half of the millions of Afghans in need after cuts in international aid and the impending freeze in US foreign funding.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 29th, 2025",
