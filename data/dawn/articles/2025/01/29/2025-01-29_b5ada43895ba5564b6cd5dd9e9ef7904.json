  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Special persons and organ donors are set to get distinct computerised national identity cards (CNICs) as the federal government has approved significant amendments to the National Database and Registration Authority (N.I.C) Rules, 2002.\n\nThese amendments have been made under Section 44 of Nadra Ordinance, 2000 (VIII of 2000). The move aims to enhance inclusivity, streamline documentation, and recognise the unique needs of specific segments of the population. One of the primary changes involves the issuance of distinct identity cards with lifetime validity for special persons.\n\nAdult special citizens, whether resident or non-resident, duly recognised by respective federal or provincial entities, will be eligible for CNICs featuring a wheelchair logo with lifetime validity. For special children, Nadra will issue Child Registration Certificates or Juvenile Cards with the symbol, valid as per the prescribed duration under Rule 18.\n\nIn addition, the amended rules also introduce a significant update for citizens who register as organ donors with respective Donor Registration Authorities. Such individuals will be issued CNICs with a donor logo, featuring lifetime validity. Citizens who qualify as both special persons and organ donors will be issued Special Cards for Dual Status, accommodating both wheelchair and donor symbols.\n\nMoreover, new schedules (VII, VIII, IX, and X) have been added to specify the forms and designs for these updated identity cards and certificates.\n\nThese amendments mark a significant milestone in the government’s efforts to ensure inclusivity and facilitate ease of identification for special persons and organ donors across Pakistan.\n\nThe notification will be published in the upcoming Gazette of Pakistan, and the implementation of these changes will take effect immediately thereafter.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 29th, 2025",
