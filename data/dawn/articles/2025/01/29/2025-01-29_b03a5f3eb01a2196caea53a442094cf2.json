I believe your leadership in this country is very aligned and like-minded, and I think it is very important that we build a strong bridge between both these groups,” he said while recalling the strong historical ties between the two countries.\n\nBeach also said that President Trump believed in economic diplomacy and that their ongoing visit was part of that effort.\n\n“We plan on investing billions of dollars in Pakistan across a number of different areas, including critical minerals and real estate […] From a real estate perspective, we brought our real estate development partners, and I am going to build some of the most high-end and luxury properties ever seen in Pakistan.”\n\nHe also mentioned energy, technology, artificial intelligence and raw areas that needed attention and investment.\n\nThe Foreign Office expressed optimism last week that Pakistan’s ties with the US will grow under the new Trump administration, while emphatically reiterating that non-interference in internal affairs is a non-negotiable foundation of bilateral relations.\n\nThe Trump administration’s approach to South Asia, shaped by its policies towards India and China, looms over Islamabad’s engagement with the US.\n\nHowever, former Pakistani diplomats have expressed concern that US engagement with Pakistan would remain limited under Trump’s second term, citing Washington’s policies toward India and China and strategic divergences that continue to strain relations between the two countries.",
