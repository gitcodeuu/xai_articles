  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Barrister Salman Safdar, representing ex-premier Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi, on Tuesday sought the transfer of their acquittal pleas in Toshakhana case to another bench, asking Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to consider the request without filing a written objection.\n\nJustice Mohammad Azam Khan a day earlier had recused himself from hearing the appeal of Khawar Farid Maneka against the couple’s acquittal in the iddat case after Mr Khan’s lawyer raised a similar objection.\n\nAppearing before Justice Minhas, Barrister Safdar said the request for case transfer was made on specific instructions of his client, explaining that the case had previously been heard by senior judges of the IHC.\n\n“I have a written objection petition, but I do not wish to formally file it. Instead, I ask the court to consider the matter carefully before setting a new hearing date,” he said.\n\nThe court adjourned the case without setting next hearing date.\n\nJail facilities for Imran\n\nMeanwhile, IHC Chief Justice Aamir Farooq disposed of a petition of Mr Khan regarding concerns over access to a personal physician, meeting with his wife, and phone calls with his children, after Adiala Jail Superintendent Ghafoor Anjum assured the court that all B-category facilities, including access to 16 TV channels, two newspapers, and a personal cook, were provided to the ex-premier.\n\nThe jail official added, family meetings were allowed twice a week but were often arranged three or four times.\n\nAbout the request for his call with children overseas, the jail superintendent explained that if international calls are allowed for one prisoner, others could challenge this in court. Jail rules and government policies currently prohibit such calls.“\n\nThe chief justice acknowledged the logistical challenges when managing a large number of prisoners.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 29th, 2025",
