  "content": "ABBOTTABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf chairman Barrister Gohar has claimed that the doors on negotiations have been closed by the government as it was not serious about the PTI demands.\n\nHe was talking to reporters at the Peshawar High Court Circuit Bench here on Wednesday.\n\nBarrister Gohar said that the party’s founding chairman Imran Khan had taken the initiative and formed a committee to hold talks with the government. He denied that the jailed leader sought a deal for himself, and said he gave a chance to democracy.\n\nMr Gohar said that the PTI had presented two demands to the government: to release all political prisoners and to set up a judicial commission to probe the May 9 events.\n\nHe said that it was unfortunate that after a month of negotiations, no solution was found as the ‘government had not shown any interest and seriousness’. “The doors on talks were closed by those who did not want a political solution to the present crisis.”\n\nSpeaking about the amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, the PTI chairman said it was a black law which was not acceptable under any circumstances. “It is to silence the voice of media,” he added.\n\nHe ruled out any change in the provincial government and said that the party had full confidence in Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief executive of the province. He said that Imran Khan had made changes in the provincial government on the request of Mr Gandapur as he could not do justice with two portfolios.\n\nHe said that Imran Khan had asked Ali Amin for zero tolerance against corruption as the special committee working under Qazi Anwar was closely watching the affairs of the KP government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 30th, 2025",
