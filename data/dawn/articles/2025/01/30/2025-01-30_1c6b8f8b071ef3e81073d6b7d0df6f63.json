  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Wednesday said that Serena Interchange project would be inaugurated on February 4.\n\nAccording to the interior ministry, this project is nearing completion at a rapid pace, with two underpasses of the project undergoing finishing touches and asphalt work progressing swiftly.\n\nA statement said that during his visit to the project site, the minister directed the authorities to expedite the finishing work and announced that the project would be inaugurated on February 4.\n\nHe directed that the surroundings should be beautified with horticulture and installation of attractive lights.\n\nHe also instructed the authorities to complete construction of connecting roads promptly.\n\nThe Serena Interchange project consists of three underpasses — one has already been completed and opened for traffic.\n\nMohsin Naqvi reviewed the beautification work at Serena Chowk and expressed his optimism that the project’s completion will resolve Islamabad’s long-standing traffic issues.\n\nThe press release stated that CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa briefed the interior minister on the project’s progress. Interior Secretary Mohammad Khurram Agha and other officials were also present on the occasion.\n\nThe project worth Rs4.2 billion was supposed to be completed within 60 days by January 5.\n\nHowever, it faced around one month delay, as CDA officials said the running nullah and hard rock consumed more time.\n\nAn officer of CDA said as per its PC-I, the project was supposed to be completed in six months, but on the direction of interior minister it was carried out round the clock and finally is going to be inaugurated on February 4.\n\nUnder the said project, three underpasses were being constructed - two on Srinagar Highway and one on Khayaban-i-Suhrawardi. The underpass on Suhrawardi road has been completed and already opened to traffic.\n\nSources in the CDA said after completion of this multi-billion project, traffic congestion issues would be resolved at this junction.\n\nHowever, they added without construction of underpass on Murree Road to link it with Srinagar Highway, one of the underpasses on Srinagar Highway (on the left side road moving towards Zero Point) would be useless for thousands of vehicles coming from Azad Kashmir and Murree.\n\nIn the absence of any direct link, traffic from Murree Road goes to Kashmir Chowk also known as Dhokri chowk, to take turn from roundabout. Residents of Azad Kashmir, Murree and other adjoining areas including Bhara Kahu had been demanding the CDA construct an underpass on Murree Road for smooth entry into Srinagar Highway. Realising this issue, the CDA chairman referred this issue to the consultant firm, which proposed an underpass.\n\nSubsequently, last month Mr Randhawa visited Murree Road and directed the engineering wing to get design of this underpass.\n\nThe CDA chief had said that construction of this underpass would offer a long-term solution to Islamabad’s traffic challenge.\n\n“Once this underpass is operational, all traffic from Murree to Srinagar Highway will be signal-free,” he had said.\n\nHowever sources said the design and estimates of this proposed underpass were not completed yet.\n\nAn officer said that design is being completed on priority by the consultant, as interior minister and chairman CDA wanted to start this project as early as possible to get maximum benefit from the Serena project.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 30th, 2025",
