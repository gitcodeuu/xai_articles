  "content": "QUETTA: The Hazara Democratic Party has expressed concern over an incident at the passport office where a community member was allegedly subjected to violence.\n\nThe HDP called for an investigation into the passport office incident, urging the authorities to take notice of the mistreatment with the applicant, Ashfaq Hus­sain, a resident of Que­tta, and demanding strict action against those responsible.\n\nA statement issued by the HDP descri­bed the incident as a denial of fundamen­tal human and civil rights, akin to an office’s outright refusal to uphold these rights.\n\n“It is unfortunate that applicants from the Hazara community are being treated like third-class citizens at passport and Nadra offices,” the party statement said, adding that officials at these offices believe themselves to be above the law.\n\nThe HDP demanded salaries and other ben­efits of officials must be linked to feedback regarding their ethics and character.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 30th, 2025",
