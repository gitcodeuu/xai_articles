Absolutely,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy told the news conference.\n\nScores of people were feared dead after the regional passenger jet and a US Army Black Hawk helicopter collided and crashed into the frigid Potomac River.\n\nOfficials provided no death toll from Wednesday night’s collision but US Senator Roger Marshall of Kansas, from where the flight was travelling, suggested most if not all those on board had been killed.\n\n“It’s really hard when you lose probably over 60 Kansans simultaneously,” he told a press conference at the airport early on Thursday. “When one person dies, it’s a tragedy, but when many, many, many people die, it’s an unbearable sorrow. It’s a heartbreak beyond measure.”\n\nAmerican Airlines confirmed 60 passengers and four crew members were aboard the jet. The helicopter, on a training flight, was carrying three soldiers, a US official said.\n\nCBS News, citing a police official, said at least 18 bodies had been recovered and reported that a dive team had recovered one of the two data recorders, the so-called black boxes, from the plane.\n\nTwo sources told Reuters that multiple bodies had been pulled from the water.\n\nThe midair collision occurred as the passenger jet, travelling from Wichita in Kansas, was on approach to land at Reagan. Radio communications between the air traffic control tower and the Black Hawk showed the helicopter crew knew the plane was in the vicinity.\n\nThe Pentagon said it was launching an investigation.\n\nIn a post on Truth Social, President Donald Trump questioned the actions of the helicopter crew and air traffic controllers on what he described as a clear night.\n\n“This is a bad situation that looks like it should have been prevented. NOT GOOD!!!” he wrote.\n\nAir traffic control recordings appear to capture the final attempted communications with the helicopter, call sign PAT25, before it collides with the plane, described as CRJ.\n\n“PAT25, do you have a CRJ in sight? PAT25, pass behind the CRJ,” an air traffic controller says at 8:47pm (6:47am), according to a recording on liveatc.net.\n\nSeconds later, another aircraft calls in to air traffic control, saying, “Tower, did you see that?” — apparently referring to the crash. An air traffic controller then redirects planes heading to runway 33 to go around.\n\nWebcam video of the crash showed the collision and an explosion lighting up the night sky.\n\n“I just saw a fireball and then it was just gone. I haven’t seen anything since they hit the river,” an air traffic controller was heard saying over the radio.\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Thursday confirmed there were no survivors in the Washington air crash, adding that he had appointed Chris Rocheleau, a senior aviation official, acting head of the US Federal Aviation Administration\n\n“I speak to you this morning in an hour of anguish for our nation,” Trump said at the White House after the crash in Washington. “The work has now shifted to a recovery mission. Sadly, there are no survivors. This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation’s capital.”\n\nHe also blamed diversity policies under Democratic ex-presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden for poor safety standards in the aviation sector. “I put safety first. Obama, Biden and the Democrats put policy first,” Trump said. “They actually came out with a directive: ‘too white.’ And we want the people that are competent.”\n\nThe president also claimed that air traffic control systems were not established properly. “They spent a lot of money renovating a system, spending much more money than they would have spent if they bought a new system for air traffic controllers, meaning the computerized systems.\n\n“There are certain companies that do a very good job. They didn’t use those companies,” Trump said.\n\nIn his address, Trump also questioned the actions of the helicopter pilot, saying it was on an “unbelievably bad” trajectory when it collided with the passenger aircraft.\n\nThe helicopter was “going at an angle that was unbelievably bad,” Trump said. “The air traffic controller said, ‘Do you see … Do you see him?’ But there was very little time left when that was stated,” the president added, blaming a “confluence of bad decisions”.\n\nRelatives gathered at the airport said they were receiving little official information. One man wept as he stood on the sidewalk at 3am outside the airport.\n\nThe plane carried a number of US ice skaters, family members and coaches returning from a camp following figure skating championships in Wichita, governing body US Figure Skating said.\n\nAmong those on board were Russian former figure skating world champions Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim Naumov, Russian state media reported.\n\nThe Kremlin offered condolences to the families of Russians killed, and said there were no plans for contacts for now between President Vladimir Putin and Trump.\n\nDonnelly said at least 300 first responders were continuing to work on the “highly complex” rescue operation.\n\nAs dawn broke over the crash site, emergency vessels with powerful arc lights and inflatables with diving teams could be seen moving back and forth over a wide area of the river.\n\n“These responders found extremely frigid conditions, they found heavy wind, they found ice on the water, and they operated all night in those conditions,” he said.\n\nHypothermia is a concern for any possible survivors and first responders.\n\n“At these frigid water temperatures, the human body’s core temperature quickly drops. Exhaustion or unconsciousness can occur in as little as 15 to 30 minutes,” AccuWeather Senior Director of Forecast Operations Dan DePodwin said.\n\nAirports Authority CEO Potter said the airport would remain closed until at least 11am on Thursday.\n\nIn 1982, Air Florida Flight 90 crashed into the 14th Street Bridge over the Potomac River, killing 70 passengers and four crew members. Only four passengers and one crew member survived.\n\nThe last deadly major crash involving a commercial airliner in the US was in 2009 when all 49 people aboard a Colgan Air flight died when the plane crashed in New York state. One person was also killed on the ground.\n\nA series of near-miss incidents in recent years has raised safety concerns.\n\nAmerican Airlines Flight 5342 was operated by PSA Airlines, American’s Ohio-based regional subsidiary, the FAA said.\n\n“We’re cooperating with the National Transportation Safety Board in its investigation and will continue to provide all the information we can,” American Airlines CEO Robert Isom said.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was “deeply saddened” by news of the accident.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with [Donald Trump] and the American people at this difficult time. Our hearts go out to the families of those who have lost their loved ones and pray for the safety of the survivors,” he said in a post on X.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said he was grieved to hear of the accident. “Our prayers for the success of the ongoing rescue efforts and heartfelt sympathies for the families of the victims and the people and the government of the United States,” he said in a post on X.",
