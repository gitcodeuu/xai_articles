  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Anti-Terror­ism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi on Wednesday rejected the acquittal applications of three individuals ac­­cused of involvement in a violent pro­­­test outside the General Head­quarters (GHQ) on May 9, 2023.\n\nJudge Amjad Ali Shah of the ATC presided over the hearing at Adiala jail, where the court dismissed the pleas of Raja Nasir Mahfouz, Naveed Umar Satti and Saad Siraj, who had sought exoneration from the charges.\n\nThe case pertains to the nationwide protests that erupted following the arrest of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan on May 9.\n\nDemonstrations turned violent in several cities, with attacks reported on military installations, including the GHQ in Rawalpindi. Authorities launched a crackdown, arresting hundreds of PTI workers and supporters, charging them under anti-terror laws.\n\nDuring the hearing, the court recorded the statement of a key witness, Khurram Ali Javed, bringing the total number of witnesses in the case to 13. Additionally, the court directed that 13 USBs containing relevant case material be provided to the defence lawyers.\n\nIn a separate development, the court sought a response from the Superintendent of Adiala Jail regarding an application questioning whether a convicted prisoner could appear in case hearings under jail manual regulations.\n\nThe court also addressed the issue of lawyer Mashal Yousafzai, whose licence had been suspe­n­ded. Despite the suspension, PTI’s founder submitted a power of attorney on her behalf. Consequently, the court forwarded a reference to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council for further deliberation. Until a final decision is made, Ms Yousafzai has been barred from entering the Adiala Jail courtroom.\n\nThe next hearing in the case has been scheduled for Feb 1 (Saturday).\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 30th, 2025",
