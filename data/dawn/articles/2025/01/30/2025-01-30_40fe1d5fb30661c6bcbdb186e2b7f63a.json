The judge noted that both convicts had the right to file an appeal in the Islamabad High Court within 30 days.\n\nThey were also sentenced to life in prison under 295B (defiling, etc, of the Holy Quran) with a fine of Rs100,000; three years imprisonment under 298A (use of derogatory remarks, etc, in respect of holy personages) with a fine of Rs500,000 and seven years of “rigorous imprisonment” for violating Section 11 (hate speech) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) with a fine of Rs100,000.\n\nThe warrants said the sentences would run concurrently except those for non-payment of fines.\n\nBlasphemy is an incendiary charge in Pakistan, where even unsubstantiated accusations can incite public outrage and lead to lynchings.\n\nA court in Rawalpindi sentenced four men to death on Monday for posting blasphemous content online, a prosecution lawyer told AFP.\n\n“They were sentenced to death … on Friday for spreading blasphemous content online against the Prophet Muhammad (PUBH) and the Quran,” Rao Abdur Raheem, a lawyer from the Legal Commission on Blasphemy Pakistan, a private group which brought the case to court, told AFP.\n\n“Our case was supported by forensic evidence from the devices used in this heinous act,” he added.\n\nThe four were charged under sections 295A, 295B, 295C, 298A of the PPC and Section 11 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act in October 2022, according to a first information report seen by Dawn.com.\n\nThe country has witnessed a sharp increase in the prosecution of “online blasphemy” cases, with private vigilante groups bringing charges against hundreds of young individuals for allegedly committing blasphemy.",
