And a waiver process exists for items not covered by pre-existing waivers.”\n\nBruce said that the goal was to get rid of “egregious” funding and programs not in line with Trump administration priorities.\n\nThe waiver was welcomed by UNAIDS, which said the move will allow people in several countries to continue accessing life-saving HIV treatments.\n\nBut despite the limited relaxation, health and humanitarian groups around the world are still uncertain if and how they could resume work.\n\nOfficials from USAID, aid groups, and health workers in Africa, Asia, Europe and the US said it was not clear what the waiver meant for their work, or if it was in effect a full reversal of previous orders telling them to stop work immediately.\n\nFederal spending freeze\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump’s freeze on federal funding has hit millions of low-income Americans, throwing rafts of programmess into disarray.\n\nPotentially trillions of dollars in federal grants, loans and other aid faced possible suspension by the White House order, but a federal judge halted the order shortly before it was to take effect Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHowever, the White House said it was prepared to contest US District Judge Loren Ali Khan’s ruling to block the funding freeze.\n\nEven before the order was set to take effect, online portals used to access the Medicaid health insurance programme for poor families and disabled individuals became inaccessible.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the website would be fixed soon and that “no payments have been affected”.\n\nShe defended the drastic move as part of Trump’s bid to make the government “good stewards of taxpayer dollars”.\n\nThe freeze is not a “blanket” stop on spending, but a tool to check that “every penny that is going out the door is not conflicting with the executive orders and actions that this president has taken,” Leavitt said.\n\nBut Democrats have accused Trump of usurping Congress’ constitutionally mandated control over budget spending as part of a broader attempt to force the government to bend to his personal will.\n\nDemocratic Senator Patty Murray called the order “a brazen & illegal move”. Another Dem­ocratic senator, Richard Blumenthal, said the order will create “havoc” in medical and research facilities, which receive major government funding.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 30th, 2025",
