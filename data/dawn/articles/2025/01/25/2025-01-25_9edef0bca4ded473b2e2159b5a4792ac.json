  "content": "CHINIOT: Eight people along with two patients entered the emergency block of the district headquarters (DHQ) hospital for treatment and quarrelled with each other in an attempt to get their patients checked first.\n\nArmed with sticks, they started beating up each other. The fight created panic in the emergency block as some patients who were getting treatment ran out and the doctors and paramedics also suffered.\n\nThe security personnel, headed by Irshad Ahmad, tried to cool both the groups down but they continued beating each other with punches, kicks and sticks, breaking the furniture and installations of the hospital.\n\nThe security staff called police who reached the hospital but the suspects fled on seeing the police. Someone recorded the whole episode and uploaded it on social media. Police traced the suspects through CCTV footage and arrested eight of them.\n\nThey were identified as Adnan, son of Mukhtar of Mohallah Toheed Abad; Zaheer Imran, son of Shahbaz, a resident of Chak 140/JB; Muhammad Hussain, son of Muhammad Ashraf, a resident of Lalian town; Kamran, son of Zafar Iqbal of Mohallah Toheed Abad Chiniot; Sohail Raza, son of Ali Raza, a resident of Hersa Sheikh village and Muhammad Adeel, son of Ismael and Muhammad Bilal, son of Umar Hayat, both residents of Kot Miana.\n\nA case was registered against them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
