  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The cabinet committee on rightsizing has directed a subcommittee to evaluate a request from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) seeking exemption from a cabinet decision mandating the abolition of 60 per cent of vacant posts within its field formations.\n\nThe meeting, chaired virtually by Mi­­nister for Finance Muhammad Aurang­zeb from Davos in Switzerland, was brie­­fed by the revenue division and the poverty alleviation and social safety ministry on their mandates, organisational structures, budget allocations, expenditures and the impact of their work on public services.\n\nAt the outset of the meeting, the revenue division proposed a one-time dispensation from the requirement to abolish 60pc of vacant posts within the field formations in response to challenges faced by the FBR. The cabinet committee on rightsizing has not mandate to allow exemptions to FBR from the cabinet decision.\n\nThe cabinet had decided last year that all federal departments would abolish 60pc of vacant posts.\n\nAurangzeb acknowledges tax body’s challenges due to under-investment over the years\n\nThe rightsizing committee was brie­fed on steps taken by the revenue division to streamline operations, including the abolition of 158 posts (BS-18 and below) and the designation of 27 posts (BS-16 to 20) as “dying posts” as part of the cabinet decision taken on August 27, 2024.\n\nA subcommittee has been assigned the task to review the performance and human resource requirements within the FBR departments. Following a thorough review, the subcommittee will submit its findings to the main committee.\n\nThe revenue division will be given an opportunity to respond to the subcommittee’s recommendations. Subseq­uen­tly, a unified set of recommendations will be forwarded to the federal cabinet for approval.\n\nAn official announcement said the presentation by the revenue division highlighted key aspects of the FBR transformation plan, focusing on initiatives designed to modernise the customs department.\n\nThe transformation plan, approved by the prime minister on Sept 19, 2024, aims to improve operations, including automation and technology integration, such as the Faceless Customs Assessment and Examination.\n\nFinance Minister Aurangzeb acknowledged the challenges faced by the FBR due to under-investment over the years and reiterated the importance of embracing technological advancements, such as the implementation of automation systems, to improve efficiency and service delivery.\n\nThe poverty alleviation and social safety ministry also presented its work, which spans across multiple departments with overlapping functions.\n\nThe finance minister remarked that while much progress had been made, the fragmented approach to various departmental verticals had hindered scaling up the impact on public policy outcomes and public service delivery.\n\nThe minister commended the presentation and emphasised the need for a more integrated approach.\n\nMr Aurangzeb tasked the subcommittee of the rightsizing committee with conducting a thorough review of both the revenue division and the poverty alleviation and social safety ministry to better assess the structure, functions and efficiencies of these federal government organs.\n\nThe subcommittee will engage with both entities to identify opportunities for improved public service outcomes in line with the committee’s mandate.\n\nThe meeting directed a follow-up examination, with a focus on rightsizing measures that ensure effectiveness, better service delivery and sustainable public policies.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
