  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), rose 0.52 per cent year-on-year in the week ending Jan 23, the lowest reading since the data available, owing to a downtrend in the prices of perishable food items.\n\nThe SPI-based inflation continued downward for the fourth week, mainly due to a decline in the prices of tomatoes, potatoes and onions. The decline was also seen in the prices of a few pulses.\n\nHowever, it declined by 0.77pc week-on-week, showed official data on Friday.\n\nThe items whose prices saw a decline week-on-week included tomatoes (32.99pc), eggs (10.23pc), onions (9.79pc), potatoes (7.37pc), LPG (2.70pc), pulse gram (1.61pc), chicken (1pc), pulse mash (0.76pc) and gur (0.50pc).\n\nThe items whose prices increased the most over the previous week included sugar (2.93pc), bananas (2.70pc), garlic (0.60pc), rice basmati broken (0.47pc), vegetable ghee 1 kg (0.33pc), pulse moong (0.25pc), cooked daal (0.21pc), rice IRRI-6/9 (0.15pc) and firewood (0.13pc).\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
