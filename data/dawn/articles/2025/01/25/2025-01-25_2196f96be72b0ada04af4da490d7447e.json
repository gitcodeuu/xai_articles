Son restored Spurs two-goal lead in the 77th minute before the hosts’ David Mokwa scored to give his side late hope but the game ended in a narrow win for the English side.\n\nTottenham coach Ange Postecoglou had pledged to win silverware for the first time for the London side since 2008 in his second season as boss.\n\nWith Spurs struggling in 15th behind Liverpool at home that leaves the Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup to fulfil his promise.\n\nA win against Swedish outfit Elfsborg in their closing league phase game at home next week will give them an automatic ticket to the next round as one of the top eight finishers.\n\n“I told them to enjoy it,” Postecoglou told TNT Sports. “Winning away in Europe, it’s a significant victory for us and gives us a good foothold to get into those top eight spots which will give us a week off,” the Australian added.\n\nMeanwhile, Lazio stayed top of the standings with a commanding 3-1 home victory over Real Sociedad to become the first team to qualify for the round of 16.\n\nMario Gila struck after five minutes and when Sociedad’s Aihen Munoz was shown a second yellow card on the half-hour mark, Lazio immediately seized the advantage.\n\nMattia Zaccagni quickly doubled the lead and Taty Castellanos effectively ended the match with a third for the hosts. Ander Barrenetxea scored a late consolation goal for Sociedad.\n\nTwo Real Sociedad fans were taken to hospital after their group was apparently attacked by hardcore Lazio supporters ahead of the match at the Olympic stadium in Rome, the Spanish club said.\n\nFormer Europa League champions Eintr­acht Frankfurt moved closer to securing a top-eight spot with a 2-0 home win over Hungarian side Ferencvaros thanks to second-half goals from Can Uzun and Hugo Ekitike.\n\nThey are second in the standings with 16 points, three ahead of ninth-placed Galatasaray.\n\nA late goal from Troy Parrott gave AZ Alkmaar a 1-0 home win over AS Roma and Olympiacos earned a 1-0 victory at Porto thanks to a late goal from Ayoub El Kaabi.\n\nDutch side Alkmaar can still reach the top eight with 11 points sitting in 14th place while Roma’s nine points place them 21st, close to the bottom of the playoff section.\n\nJose Mourinho’s Fenerbahce and Olympique Lyonnais played out an intense goalless draw in Istanbul, leaving the French side in a strong position to progress in fifth place in the group on 14 points.\n\nThere was a bizarre moment before the match as Mourinho appeared to mistake the Lyon’s physiotherapist for coach Pierre Sage.\n\nMourinho walked toward Abdeljelil Redissi, shook hands and hugged him before the physiotherapist pointed the bemused Portuguese to Sage, who was a few metres away.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
