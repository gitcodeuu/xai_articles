Earlier, there was gas in the cities and people used to burn wood in the villages, but now people in the cities were also forced to use wood for cooking, he added.\n\nHe said that electricity loadshedding was also done for 16 to 17 hours in the province.\n\nThe minister said that it was the responsibility of the gas companies to improve their infrastructure. He said that the adjournment motion would be passed and sent it to the federation.\n\nMr Memon also asked the MQM-P members to take up the issue with the federal government as they were a coalition partner.\n\nEarlier, Speaker Awais Qadir Shah began the proceedings at 10am to find only 10 lawmakers on their seats in the house. The Question Hour was not held as none of the lawmakers who had submitted their written questions turned up.\n\nA dismayed speaker proceeded with the call attention notices as the number of members finally rose to 44 in a 168-member house.\n\nIn his call attention notice, MQM-P’s Shariq Jamal pointed out that the streets were filthy and littered with garbage in parts of his constituency PS-90.\n\nHe said that neither the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board nor any local government authority took responsibility to dispose of garbage in Malir Saudabad, Khorkhrapar and adjoining localities.\n\nIn response, Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said that the complaint of the MQM-P member might be correct.\n\nHe said that the provincial government was spending millions of rupees on the garbage disposal and now the garbage was being collected and was shifted to landfill sites.\n\nThe minister said that the provincial government was giving Rs1.2 million to each union council so that the problems of the areas would be reduced.\n\nSabir Qaimkhani pointed out that ministers were not there and said that if they were busy, parliamentary secretaries should have been in the house to respond to the lawmakers queries.\n\nSharjeel Memon said that the parliamentary secretaries should be bound to attend the house.\n\nLater, the house was adjourned to Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
