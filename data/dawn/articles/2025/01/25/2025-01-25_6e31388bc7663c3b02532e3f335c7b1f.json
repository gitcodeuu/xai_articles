  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Amid the private sector calls for an open market to foster competition, the provincial governments have supported the deregulation of the wheat market.\n\nSpeaking at a workshop organised by the Ministry of National Food Security and Research in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank on Friday, the representatives of provinces highlighted the challenges facing the sector, such as infrastructure deficits, policy gaps, and resource constraints.\n\nThe private sector stakeholders asked the government to develop clear policies and a stable regulatory environment essential for fair investment in the sector.\n\nThe workshop, attended by provincial government officials, private sector stakeholders and international partners, addressed the challenges and explored opportunities in the country’s wheat sector.\n\nWorld Bank Lead Agriculture Specialist Oliver Durand pointed out Pakistan’s low wheat productivity and called for policy reforms, strategic investments, and market-driven value chain development. Comprehensive discussions on wheat price trends (2009-2023) further contextualised the economic challenges in the sector.\n\nParticipants presented plans to modernise Pakistan’s grain storage infrastructure, focusing on efficiency and food safety. They emphasised the need for private-sector investment in strategic wheat reserves.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
