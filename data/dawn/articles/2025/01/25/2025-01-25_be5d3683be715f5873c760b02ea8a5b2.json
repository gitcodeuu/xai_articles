Gadkari, a lawmaker from Maharashtra state where the explosion occurred, offered his condolences.\n\nMaharashtra’s chief mini­ster Devendra Fadna­vis said earlier on X that up to 14 workers had been trapped after the blast and emergency rescue operations were underway.\n\nIndian Defence Minis­ter Rajnath Singh said he was “deeply saddened” by the blast.\n\n“My condolences to the bereaved families. Praying for the speedy recovery of the injured,” Singh said on X.\n\nIndustrial disasters are common in India, with experts blaming poor planning and lax enforcement of safety rules. Nine workers were killed in a 2023 blast at a factory in Maharashtra that manufactured drones and explosives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
