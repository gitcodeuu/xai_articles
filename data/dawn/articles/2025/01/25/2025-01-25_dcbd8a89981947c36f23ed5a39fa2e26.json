Consequently, he added, it led to wastage of time, resources of the institution as well as the parties, the SC explained.\n\nIt may be recalled that the cases were briefly fixed before a regular bench, then comprising Justice Shah, Justice Ayesha A. Malik and Justice Irfan Saadat Khan. The bench was later reduced to Justice Shah and Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi. The cases were heard on Jan 13 when, in addition to merit of the case, the constitutionality of Section 221A (2) of the Customs Act was challenged.\n\n‘Serious nature of lapse’\n\nThe jurisdiction of the bench was contested and subsequently the cases were adjourned to Jan 16, but realising the serious lapse on its part, the judicial branch approached the regular committee under Section 2(1) of the SC (Practice and Procedure) Act, (PPA) 2023.\n\nKeeping in view the nature of the lapse, the committee convened on Jan 17 under Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi and noted that Article 191A(3) of the Constitution, read with Article 191A (5), expressly vests such jurisdiction only in the constitutional bench.\n\nThus the committee withdrew the cases from the regular bench and directed that the same be placed before the constitutional bench’s committee, formed under Article 191A, for re-fixation.\n\nMeanwhile, the smaller bench of Justice Shah initiated contempt proceedings by framing questions: whether the two committees under PPA and Article 191A have the authority to withdraw a case from the regular bench hearing serious questions of constitutional law relating to its jurisdiction and whether these committees can, by an administrative order, undo the effect of a judicial order, whereby next date of hearing of a specific case had been fixed before a regular bench.\n\nIn his application, the additional registrar argued that the constitution of benches or approval of the roster was beyond the appellant’s capacity and jurisdiction. His responsibility, at the most, was to apprise the competent authority about the non-availability of any appropriate bench, which had not only been conveyed before time but had also been suggested to be met with by formation of the bench, so there was no lapse on part of the appellant in the entire scenario.\n\nThe petition contended that the act of the office was neither deliberate nor wilful, rather in pursuance of the decisions taken by the regular committee and the constitutional committee.\n\nIt explained that the appellant had initiated an office note to comply with the Jan 16 order of the smaller bench in letter and spirit by constitution of the requisite special bench and having no intention to withhold or disobey the SC’s order.\n\nTherefore, it argued, the show cause notice is misconceived and has been issued on presumption that the appellant had any role in non-fixation of the cases, which is factually incorrect.\n\nThe petitioner alleged that he had been made a scapegoat by removing him from his post and making him OSD without even an iota of malfunctioning on his part.\n\nThe appellant has been vilified in the press and his reputation tarnished without any fault on his part, the petition said. It regretted that grave miscarriage of justice had been caused to the appellant. Besides the court should not be “unduly touchy or over astute in discovering new varieties of contempt”, the appeal highlighted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
