  "content": "LARKANA: A group of armed tribesmen critically injured a young man when he was returning home on a motorcycle, and then attacked a woman after barging into her house on Friday, reportedly to make the attacks appear to be motivated by tribal revenge for perceived slur on honour. Both the victims died later at hospital.\n\nThe victims’ relatives said that the armed men belonging to Brohi tribe shot at Riaz Hussain Brohi, 28, near Warah Canal bridge, 14 kilometres from here when he was going home in Noor Mohammad Brohi village on a motorcycle.\n\nPeople from nearby villages shifted the severely injured man to Trauma Centre Larkana but he did not survive.\n\nLater, the same group of armed men barged into a house near Bagris graveyard in the jurisdiction of Rahmatpur police station in Nazar locality, Larkana city, and seriously wounded Tahmina, daughter of Akbar Brohi, 20, who was transported with multiple injuries in a precarious condition to Trauma Centre where she too succumbed to injuries.\n\nAyaz Ali Brohi, younger brother of late Riaz Brohi, told journalists that his brother had just returned from Dubai. He visited his native village Noor Mohammad Brohi after purchasing a new motorcycle a day before and was attacked on his way back to Larkana where he was currently living in Yar Mohammad Colony.\n\nHe accused one Khalid Brohi and his associates of murdering his brother. The same group was involved in killing Tahmina Brohi in her home, he said.\n\nPolice officials at Lashari police station said the double murder was an offshoot of a running feud over matrimonial issues.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
