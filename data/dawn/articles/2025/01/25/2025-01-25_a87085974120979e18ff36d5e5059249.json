After two rounds of meetings, the third round was held seven days ago (Jan 16) in which the PTI formally presented its demands in writing.\n\nDespite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process has hardly moved forward on major issues — the formation of judicial commissions and the release of PTI prisoners.\n\nOn Monday, the government assured the PTI of a response to the opposition’s ‘charter of demands’ within seven working days after the party warned it would boycott the next round of talks if judicial commissions were not formed to investigate the May 9 and Nov 26 incidents.\n\nOn Friday, speaking at a press conference outside the Parliament House, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, flanked by PTI leaders Omar Ayub Khan, Shibli Faraz and Ali Mohammad Khan, said that Imran Khan had approved negotiations despite the long charge sheet against him and the party.\n\n“The (stipulated) days have passed, but the government has not announced the formation of judicial commissions even after (the deadline passed) yesterday,” he said, adding that the negotiations ended because the government was “not serious at any stage”.\n\n“We presented them with simple demands during the negotiations. What was wrong with announcing the formation of a judicial commission?” he questioned.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Gohar said the government had promised to form the requested judicial commissions within seven days, but it failed to do so. “The PTI founder has asked the party to call off the talks over the government’s failure to form judicial commissions,” he said.\n\nHe added that the PTI was hopeful of continuing the talks, but they have to be called off due to “non-cooperation from the government”.\n\n‘Hasty lawmaking’ criticised\n\nThe PTI leaders also criticised the recent legislative activity in Parliament, alleging that eight laws were passed within 11 minutes without debate. Mr Gohar claimed that 37 bills were pushed through in a similar fashion, many of which were later rejected by the President.\n\n“According to the Constitution, laws are passed considering the objection of the president,” he said. “Even in India, the session lasts for six hours. The world will remember how the house (in Pakistan) was run this year.”\n\nThe PTI also condemned the recent ame­n­dments to the Prevention of Electro­nic Crimes Act (Peca), passed by the National Assembly a day earlier. Senator Shibli Faraz described the legislation as a “black law against freedom of expression”, accusing the government of stifling dissent and curbing media freedoms.\n\nThe bill was passed in the National Assembly a day ago, following which journalists staged a walkout from the press gallery in protest.\n\nMr Faraz said the amendments were meant to push media representatives into the dark, adding that efforts were being made to suppress people’s voices.\n\n“And then they [the government] complain about people not investing in Pakis­tan. How can people invest here when such laws are being passed?” he said.\n\nHe said that senators and MNAs were silent on the passage of the amendment bills. “They are enjoying their positions based on a fake mandate. That’s why they don’t care about the people.”\n\nOmar Ayub Khan echoed these conce­rns, warning that online businesses would suffer under the new provisions. Opposi­tion lawmakers from JUI-F also opposed the amendments.\n\nPTI urged to reconsider\n\nAddressing reporters on Thursday, Sen­a­tor Irfan Siddiqui urged the PTI to reconsider its decision to boycott the talks, emp­hasising the need for political stability.\n\n“I cannot understand the reason for the PTI’s threat to abandon talks,” he said. The two sides had already agreed to give the government time to furnish its formal written response to the PTI’s demands, he said, adding that the deadline was not yet up.\n\n“I don’t have the words except that they were in a hurry to arrive and are in a hurry to depart. We ask them to stay for a few days and not go back; let the weather become pleasant,” Mr Siddiqui said.\n\nHe said the coalition parties had “almost” formed an opinion on the PTI’s demands. “They should reconsider if it is in their power and if they can form an opinion apart from their founder’s opinion,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
