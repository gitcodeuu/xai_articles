He faces many challenges in governance and ensuring law and order.\n\n“Therefore, at his (Gandapur’s) request, PTI founder Imran Khan decided that Junaid Akbar Khan will become PTI president in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”\n\nFielding further questions, the secretary general added that PTI member Aliya Hamza will be assigned a greater role in the party. “Imran Khan wants her to have a bigger role. We will have a meeting and decide what role to assign her.”\n\nAfter being appointed PTI KP president, Akbar issued a statement on X expressing gratitude for his appointment. “I am a middle-class person and I got this position because of hard work. Which is not found in other parties,” he wrote.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, he said, “Do not confuse our good faith with weakness. We want the rift between the public and institutions to be closed. We will not be scared or pressured, because we are not a party that can be scared or pressured.”",
