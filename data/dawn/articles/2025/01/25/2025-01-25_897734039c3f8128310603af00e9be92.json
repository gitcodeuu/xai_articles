The team conducted detailed interviews of the 21 survivors in the Moroccan town of Dakhla, as well as meetings with officials at the Pakistani embassy in Rabat.\n\nAccording to the FO statement issued today, arrangements are being made for the repatriation of 22 Pakistani survivors staying in Dakhla.\n\n“Following thorough investigations and careful coordination with Moroccan authorities, these individuals will be returned to Pakistan in batches,” the statement read.\n\nThe FO added that the embassy in Rabat has been closely working with Moroccan authorities and that the consular team in Dakhla was “instrumental” in planning the return of survivors.\n\n“The Foreign Ministry’s Crisis Management Unit (CMU) has been actively engaged in monitoring the situation, providing necessary support to the affected individuals, and maintaining active communication with their families,” the FO added.\n\n“National identity verification remained a critical component of this process which was completed expeditiously in coordination with the Interior Ministry and the relevant departments.”\n\nThe statement added that the FO is facilitating the repatriation of 11 Pakistanis from Mauritania through a separate process, adding that they have “voluntarily chosen to return home”.",
