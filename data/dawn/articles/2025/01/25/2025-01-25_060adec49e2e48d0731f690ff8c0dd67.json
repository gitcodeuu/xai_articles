  "content": "US tech billionaire Elon Musk gave a video address to a campaign rally of Germany’s anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party on Saturday, his latest show of support ahead of the country’s election next month.\n\nMusk told a gathering of thousands of AfD supporters in the eastern city of Halle that their party was “the best hope for the future of Germany”.\n\nMusk has raised concern from some mainstream leaders who have accused him of interfering in European politics with comments on his social platform X about politicians in countries including Germany and Britain.\n\nHe also drew criticism this week for making a public hand gesture that was seen by some as resembling a straight-armed Nazi salute.\n\n“The German people are really an ancient nation which goes back thousands of years,” he said in Saturday’s address. “I even read Julius Caesar was very impressed (by) the German tribes,” he said, urging the supporters to “fight, fight, fight” for their country’s future.\n\nHe said the AfD wanted “more self-determination for Germany and for the countries in Europe and less from Brussels”, a reference to European Union authorities.\n\nMusk is a close associate of US President Donald Trump, who has appointed him to head a new department of “government efficiency” in his administration.\n\nLike Trump, the AfD opposes immigration, denies climate change, rails against gender politics and has declared war on a political establishment and mainstream media it condemns as censorious.\n\nAhead of Germany’s February 23 elections, it is polling at around 20 per cent, a new record for a party that has already shattered a decades-old taboo against the far right in postwar Germany. The mainstream conservative grouping CDU/CSU leads on about 30pc.",
