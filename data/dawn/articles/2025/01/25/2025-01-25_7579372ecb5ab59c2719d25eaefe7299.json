  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Rawalpindi Development Authority (RDA) on Friday sealed 10 plazas and five houses on Morgah Road, Gulshan Abad and Dhamyal Kalyal Road for violation of building plans and regulations.\n\nAccording to a press release, the owners of these properties were found in violation of the approved building plans. Despite multiple notices issued by the RDA, the owners continued to disregard regulations, violating the Punjab Development of Cities Act 1976 and the RDA Building and Zoning Regulations 2020.\n\nThe properties were converted into illegal residential-cum-commercial establishments without the required approvals or no-objection certificates (NOCs).\n\nThe notices had been sent to the owners of properties regarding the illegal construction but there was no compliance with the authorities’ directives.\n\nRDA Director General Kinza Murtaza has directed the Land Use and Building Control (LU&BC) Wing to implement stricter measures against encroachments, unauthorised constructions, and illegal commercial activities.\n\nThe Building Control Wing has also been directed to review and impose fees and charges for the approval of illegal residential and commercial buildings, with a focus on regularising all such structures within RDA’s jurisdiction.\n\nShe said that the RDA remained committed to upholding the city’s planning and zoning laws to ensure orderly urban development.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
