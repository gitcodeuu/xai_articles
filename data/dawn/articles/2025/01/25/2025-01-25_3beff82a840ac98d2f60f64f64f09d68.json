Federal forecasters estimate a 10 to 20pc likelihood of significant flooding and debris flow.\n\n“While damaging debris flows are not the most likely outcome, there is still a lot of uncertainty with this storm,” the weather service office in Oxnard said, adding: “The threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario.”\n\nThe burn scar from September’s Bridge Fire in the Angeles National Forest above the San Gabriel Valley, along with the Hughes Fire area northwest of Los Angeles — which has burned 10,396 acres and was 79pc contained as of Friday — are also included in the scheduled flood watches.\n\nLos Angeles County, along with cities like Los Angeles, Pasadena, and Baldwin Park, is providing sandbags to residents preparing for potential mudflows.\n\nRain could begin in Los Angeles County Saturday afternoon and intensify on Sunday with the possibility of “moderate to locally heavy rain and small hail or graupel,” according to the National Weather Service.\n\nForecasters expressed their prediction for a quarter-inch of rain in urban Los Angeles and up to an inch in San Diego, adding that Sunday could see heavier rain.\n\nWinter storm warnings have been issued for the San Gabriel and San Bernardino mountain ranges, including communities like Wrightwood, Big Bear City, Big Bear Lake, Crestline, Running Springs, and Lake Arrowhead, due to expected snow. The 48-hour warnings will begin at 4pm local time on Sunday.\n\nThe weather service predicts up to 18 inches of snow could accumulate above 6,000 feet, with as much as 6 inches possible above 4,000 feet, from Saturday afternoon to Monday afternoon.",
