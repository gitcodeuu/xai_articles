  "content": "LAHORE: The Provin­cial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Fri­day issued a severe drou­ght advisory for Punjab due to 40 per cent below normal rainfall for the first time in the province’s history.\n\nThe advisory, directed to all divisional and deputy commissioners, follo­wed a similar alert issued by the Pakistan Meteo­ro­logical Department’s Nat­ional Drought Monitoring Center (NDMC).\n\nThe NDMC advisory noted that from September 1, 2024 to January 15, 2025, the rainfall across Pakistan was 40 per cent below normal, with a reduction of 42pc in Punjab.\n\nThis drastic reduction in rainfall is expected to exacerbate water stress in cultivated lands, particularly in rain-fed regions, due to the limited supply of irrigation water for Rabi crops.\n\nIssues advisory for pre-emptive measures\n\nThe persistent drought conditions in Punjab’s rain-fed regions are anticipated to worsen in January, February and March in the absence of significant rainfall.\n\nThe PDMA has requested local administrations to take pre-emptive measures for drought risk management in their respective divisions and districts.\n\nPDMA Director Gen­­e­ral Irfan Ali Kathiya said farmers should be infor­med in advance about the possible water shortage.\n\nHe directed the administrations to make advance arrangements for the expected water shortage in Thal and Cholistan.\n\nThe School Education Department will also be involved in creating awareness about measures to prevent crops from damaging.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 25th, 2025",
