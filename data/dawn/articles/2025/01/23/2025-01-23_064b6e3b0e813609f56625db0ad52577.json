Giving a loud and clear message to those who wished to harm the friendship between Pakistan and China, he said they would fail in their nefarious designs, as the ties between the two countries were based on mutual, unshakeable trust.\n\nHe likened the more than seven-decade-long Pakistan-China friendship to a bouquet that spread colors and is bound to grow stronger in the future.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2025",
