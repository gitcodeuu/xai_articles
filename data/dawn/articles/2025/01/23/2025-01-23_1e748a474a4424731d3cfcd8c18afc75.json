  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In the second stage of their protest, government employees on Wednesday gathered in front of ‘Q’ Block Pak Secretariat under the banner of the All Government Employees Grand Alliance (AGEGA) to demand better salaries, and the reversal of pension reforms.\n\nThey demanded 200pc increase in house rent, medical, and conveyance allowances, as was recommended by the Pay and Pension Committee in 2020.\n\nThey warned that if their demands were not met by Feb 10, the employees would hold a sit-in in front of the Parliament building for an indefinite period until their demands are met.\n\nThe protest of AGEGA, which included over 100 unions and associations from various government departments, took place in Islamabad as well as provincial headquarters across the country.\n\nThe protesters had been wearing black armbands since January 6 as a mark of protest.\n\nOn Wednesday, participants gathered at Q Block in the Pakistan Secretariat and marched towards the Parliament building, led by AGEGA Chief Coordinator Rehman Ali Bajwa.\n\nIn his address to the crowd in front of the Parliament, Rehman Bajwa expressed frustration over the disparity in salary increases, pointing out that judges, parliamentarians, and select government servants had received generous salary hikes but other government employees were ignored.\n\nHe also raised concerns regarding allowances, calling for a 200pc increase in house rent, medical, and conveyance allowances, as was recommended by the Pay and Pension Committee in 2020. He emphasised that instead of privatising government institutions, the focus should be on better management and restructuring to improve efficiency.\n\nRehman Bajwa warned that if their demands were not met by February 10, the employees would hold a sit-in in front of the Parliament building for an indefinite period until their issues were addressed.\n\nDr Rahima Rehman, former president of the Federal Government College Teachers Association, called for the withdrawal of recent reforms related to leave encashment and pensions, which she argued negatively affected teachers and government servants.\n\nThe rally’s participants made several demands, including the regularisation of contract employees and daily wage workers, the restoration of employees dismissed under the government’s rightsizing scheme, and the withdrawal of a tax increase imposed on employees’ salaries.\n\nThe protest ended peacefully, with protesters dispersing in an orderly manner.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2025",
