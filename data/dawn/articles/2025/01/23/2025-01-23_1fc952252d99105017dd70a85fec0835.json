  "content": "LAHORE: An anti-corruption court on Wednesday heard partial arguments of defence on the acquittal applications of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz in the Ramzan Sugar Mills case.\n\nDuring the hearing, Prime Minister Shehbaz was represented by his pleader Anwaar Hussain while Hamza Shehbaz once again skipped his appearance.\n\nThe defence lawyer told the court that Hamza was out of the country for a medical check-up of his daughter.\n\nAdvocate Amjad Pervaiz, the lead defence counsel, said the petitioners were accused of constructing a waste water drain near the Ramzan Sugar Mills using public funds.\n\nHe stated that the drain was constructed by the Punjab government, which remains its owner. He pointed out that sugar mill pays rent for the use of the drain, which was approved on a request by local MPA Maulana Rehmatullah.\n\nThe counsel argued that the drain was a government project like other schemes in Chiniot.\n\nHe said exercising lawful authority does not constitute a crime unless corruption is proven.\n\nHe argued that the Ramzan Sugar Mills case was politically motivated and fabricated to target PM Shehbaz’s family. He said the mill was established in 1991 and inherited by Hamza from his grandfather Mian Muhammad Sharif.\n\nAdvocate Pervez stated that the waste water drain passing near the mills is 10km long and serves other villages in addition to the mills.\n\nHe said the drain was not built on the chief minister’s orders but was approved by the provincial cabinet and authorised by the assembly.\n\nHe submitted that the Lahore High Court had noted in PM Shehbaz Sharif’s bail granting order that the drain had cabinet’s approval.\n\nHe sought acquittal of PM Shehbaz and Hamza in the case, saying the allegations lacked evidence of corruption and were politically driven.\n\nJudge Sardar Muhammad Iqbal Dogar adjourned the hearing for further arguments till Jan 28.\n\nOn Oct 17, an accountability court had transferred the Ramzan Sugar Mills reference to the anti-corruption court due to lack of jurisdiction following amendments in the National Accountability Ordinance 1999.\n\nThe NAB, after the amendment, cannot prosecute an alleged offence involving money less than Rs500 million and the offence amount in the mills reference was below the minimum value.\n\nThe accountability court was informed that the NAB in its reference made a case of alleged corruption of Rs213 million.\n\nThe NAB reference filed in 2018 alleged that PM Shehbaz being chief minister and his son Hamza with the abetment and connivance of each other caused a loss to national exchequer of Rs213m by committing the offence of misuse of authority.\n\nIt said Mr Shehbaz had issued a directive for the construction of a drain in Chiniot district primarily for the use of Ramzan Sugar Mills owned by his sons - Hamza and Suleman.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2025",
