The AAG explained that the cabinet committee was already working on the law.\n\nJustice Mandokhail regretted that the law on the missing persons already exists, adding that the enforced disappearance was a crime. If someone is guilty, let them be tried. If not, then release them.\n\nThe AAG said the federal government wanted to resolve this issue comprehensively, once and for all.\n\nJustice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi inquired as to how many missing persons have been recovered by the commission so far and will these individuals ever testify where they were kept.\n\nThe registrar of CIED however informed the court that the recovered individuals always kept mum and they do not share the whereabouts where they were detained.\n\nJustice Musarrat Hilali however stressed the need for early legislation to end the chronic issue of missing persons.\n\nJustice Mandokhail said “we can only hope that the government will take decisive action but we cannot compel parliament to legislate”.\n\nEarlier on Jan 3, 2024, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court headed by then Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Qazi Faez Isa had ordered the federal government to furnish an undertaking in writing, signed by senior-most officers of the ministries concerned, that no citizen will be picked up other than in accordance with the law.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2025",
