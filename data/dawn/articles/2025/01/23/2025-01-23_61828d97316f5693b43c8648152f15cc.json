Trump said he expected to have a “very good relationship” with China, but stressed that “all we want is fairness.”\n\nDuring his first administration, Trump engaged in an escalating tariff war with Beijing, and he threatened higher duties on the campaign trail as well.\n\nIn wide-ranging remarks, Trump also signalled he would exert pressure to bring interest rates lower. “I’ll demand that interest rates drop immediately,” he said. “Likewise, they should be dropping all over the world. Interest rates should follow us all over.”\n\nHe also spoke on the issue of gender surgery, saying he has made it “official policy of the United States, that there are only two genders, male and female”. He took aim at “men participating in women’s sports” while adding that gender operations “will occur very rarely”.\n\nSince taking office, Trump has vowed an immediate overhaul of the US trade system, promising to tariff and tax foreign countries to the benefit of US citizens.\n\nHe has signed an order directing agencies to study trade issues ranging from deficits to unfair practices — paving the way towards further tariffs in the future.\n\nDuring this appearance, the US president also took questions from Bank of America chief executive Brian Moynihan, Blackstone investment firm boss Stephen Schwarzman, Spanish group Banco Santander executive chairwoman Ana Botin and the head of French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies, Patrick Pouyanne.\n\nOne of the Republican president’s biggest cheerleaders on the world stage, Argentina’s libertarian President Javier Milei, took the stage hours before Trump, delivering a fiery speech against “the mental virus of woke ideology”.\n\nMilei said Argentina was “re-embracing the idea of freedom” and “that is what I trust President Trump will do in this new America”. He praised like-minded leaders such as Trump, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban and El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele.\n\n“Slowly an international alliance has been formed of all those nations that want to be free and that believe in the ideas of freedom,” he said.\n\nHe also defended his “dear friend” Elon Musk. The US billionaire and Trump ally caused a stir this week by making hand gestures at an inauguration event for the US president that drew comparisons to the Nazi salute.\n\nMilei said Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has been “unfairly vilified by wokeism in recent hours for an innocent gesture that only means … his gratitude to the people”.\n\nOne of Trump’s backers in the business world, Marc Benioff, the chief executive of US tech firm Salesforce, was enthusiastic at a Bloomberg event on Wednesday.\n\n“I’m very positive,” he said. “I’m just looking forward to seeing what’s going to happen. And it’s a new day and, it’s an exciting moment.”\n\nUS trade partners and rivals already had a chance to react in Davos earlier this week, as they brace for a second round of his America First policies.\n\nWithout invoking Trump’s name, Chinese Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang warned: “There are no winners in a trade war.”\n\nEuropean Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said Brussels was ready to negotiate with Trump.\n\nBut she also underscored the European Union’s diverging policy with him on climate, saying the bloc would stick by the Paris accord.\n\nWorld Trade Organisation chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala called on cooler heads to prevail during a WEF panel discussion on tariffs today, warning that tit-for-tat levies would be “catastrophic” for the world economy.\n\n“Please let’s not hyperventilate,” she quipped. “I know we are here to discuss tariffs. I’ve been saying to everybody: could we chill, also?”",
