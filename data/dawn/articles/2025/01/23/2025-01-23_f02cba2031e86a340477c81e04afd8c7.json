  "content": "RAWALPINDI: An anti-terrorism court in Rawalpindi issued a show cause notice to Mashal Yousafzai on Wednesday for attempting to legally represent former prime minister Imran Khan in a May 9 case even though her practicing licence was suspended.\n\nATC Judge Amjad Ali Shah, resumed the proceedings in Adiala jail, and several accused, including Mr Khan, appeared in court.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the statements of four additional prosecution witnesses were recorded, including Assistant Sub-Inspector Shahzad, Head Constable Imran Akhtar, and constables Zubair Siddiqui and Anwar.\n\nThis brought the total number of witnesses recorded in the case to nine.\n\nYousafzai submitted power of attorney to represent ex-PM despite alleged licence suspension\n\nThe court scheduled January 25 for arguments on the acquittal applications submitted by Mr Khan, Shireen Mazari, and others.\n\nA significant point of contention arose during the hearing when Prosecutor Zaheer Shah raised objections to the power of attorney submitted by Mashal Yousafzai on behalf of the PTI founder. Prosecutor Shah alleged that Ms Yousafzai’s licence had been suspended by the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, questioning her authority to represent the accused.\n\nThe court issued a show cause notice to Mashal Yousafzai for submitting the power of attorney despite the alleged cancellation of her licence. The court stated this act could constitute professional misconduct and asked her to submit a written response by the next hearing on January 25.\n\nThe court also sought explanations from Ms Yousafzai as to “why her licence should not be permanently cancelled by the bar council” and “why criminal proceedings should not be initiated against her for alleged forgery”.\n\nThe court adjourned the hearing until January 25, when further arguments and submissions were expected to take place.\n\nIn Islamabad, Judicial Magistrate Ahmed Shahzad Gondal formally indicted 33 individuals in connection with two cases filed at the Ramna police station regarding the PTI protest on November 26, 2024.The accused have been charged under various sections, including arson, violation of Section 144, and rioting. During the hearing, the court read the charges to the accused, all of whom pleaded not guilty.\n\nFollowing this, the magistrate summoned witnesses to record their testimonies in the next hearing scheduled for January 27.\n\nThe cases revolve around allegations of illegal assembly, rioting, and arson. Police invoked multiple sections of the law, accusing the individuals of disrupting public order and violating prohibitory orders in place under Section 144.\n\nMeanwhile, an ATC in Islamabad granted post-arrest bail to 28 PTI workers while rejecting the bail application of one accused in cases registered in connection with the November 26 protest.\n\nThe cases, filed under anti-terrorism laws, were related to incidents reported at various police stations, including Secretariat and Kohsar.\n\nFollowing the hearing, ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Mohammad Zulqarnain approved bail for 28 accused individuals, allowing their release pending further proceedings. However, one accused was denied bail.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 23rd, 2025",
