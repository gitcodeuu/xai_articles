However, the ECP denied PTI at least 77 reserved seats and distributed these among other political parties in the assemblies.\n\n“The ECP has arguably been the biggest loser in the rapidly dwindling democracy, democratic rights and processes in Pakistan…[it] sacrificed its independence either on the altar of personal and political opportunism or acute pressure or both and paved the way for yet another manipulated general election spiralling the country into further democratic chaos,” the report observed.\n\nWhen the PTI got relief through a majority judgement by the Supreme Court arguing that election authorities denying the party recognition infringed upon electorate’s rights, the ECP and parliament dragged their feet on its implementation while the then CJP spent considerable time in poking holes in legality of the orders by the majority bench headed by Justice Mansoor Ali Shah.\n\nAggressive legislation\n\nApparently to safeguard its razor-thin majority in the parliament, the federal government embarked on a mission to restructure higher judiciary.\n\n“The 26th Amendment, ramrodded through parliament by very unsavoury means, amended, substituted, or added 25 articles and one schedule of the Constitution out of which only nine articles dealt with subjects other than the judiciary,” said the report.\n\nThe thrust of the amendment included changes in the appointment procedure of the chief justice of Pakistan through a 12-member parliamentary committee, instead of the earlier process of automatic appointment of the senior-most judge.\n\n“This meant [a] massive increase in the influence of parliament and the executive in key aspects of the judiciary,” the report noted. The second important change in the top judiciary included splitting of the judiciary through the introduction of constitutional benches, to be constituted by the Judicial Commission and in the high courts through approval of the respective provincial assemblies.\n\nThe government also bypassed normal parliamentary procedure and amended the law to increase the tenure limits and retirement ages of three services chiefs from three to five years.\n\nShrinking space\n\nGoing beyond the control and censorship of the traditional news media, the report noted that the rulers moved to create hurdles on use of internet and related social media applications.\n\nRestrictions on internet freedoms, however, came about after the military began to condemn proliferation of propaganda and false information targeting security forces online. Later, the army chief referred to citizens’ abuse of social media platforms as “digital terrorism”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
