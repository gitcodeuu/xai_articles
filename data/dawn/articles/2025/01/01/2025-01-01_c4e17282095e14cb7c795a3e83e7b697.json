According to the police, it was a powerful F4 category firework, which requires a special permit to purchase.\n\nIn the same eastern region of Saxony, a 50-year-old man died on the spot from head injuries in the town of Hartha when he tried to detonate a pyrotechnic pipe bomb, a police spokesperson said.\n\nNear Hamburg in the north, a 20 year-old man died lighting a pyrotechnic firework.\n\nFinally, in Kremen near Berlin, a fifth man died from an “inappropriate manipulation” of pyrotechnics, according to local police. Three other people in the region were seriously injured in similar circumstances.",
