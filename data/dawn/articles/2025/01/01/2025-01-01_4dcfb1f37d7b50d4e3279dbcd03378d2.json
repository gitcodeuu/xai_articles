These sectors collectively accounted for 66pc of the index’s gains, according to Arif Habib Limited.\n\nKey performers included FFC, which added 6,086 points, Mari Petroleum (3,977 points), United Bank Limited (UBL) (3,957 points), and Oil & Gas Development Company (2,613 points).\n\nThe PSX unprecedented trading activity in 2024. Daily average trading volumes in the cash market surged 76pc to 569m shares, while average traded value jumped 122pc to Rs22bn — the highest since 2007.\n\nThe futures market also saw significant growth, with daily volumes rising 68pc to 184m shares and traded value up 80pc to Rs8bn.\n\nThe rally was underpinned by falling inflation, declining yields on fixed-income instruments, aggressive monetary easing of 900 basis points by the State Bank of Pakistan and a stable rupee.\n\nThese improvements, coupled with political stability under the new IMF programme, bolstered investor confidence.\n\nMarket capitalisation, IPOs see growth\n\nPSX’s market capitalisation rose 63pc to $52bn in 2024, though it remains below the 2017 peak of $100bn. Seven initial public offerings (IPOs), including two on the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) Board, raised Rs8.4bn — the highest since 2021.\n\nGovernment Sharia-compliant bonds (sukuk) worth Rs2 trillion were also listed during the year. However, secondary market trading for sukuk remained thin, averaging Rs163m per day.\n\nLocal mutual funds and insurance companies were major buyers in 2024, taking advantage of lower interest rates.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
