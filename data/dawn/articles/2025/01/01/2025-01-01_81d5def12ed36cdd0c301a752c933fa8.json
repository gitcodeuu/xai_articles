  "content": "GENEVA: A United Nations report published on Tuesday found that Israeli strikes on and near hospitals in the Gaza Strip had left healthcare in the Palestinian territory on the verge of collapse.\n\nThe report by the UN human rights office said such strikes raised grave concerns about Israel’s compliance with international law.\n\n“Israel’s pattern of deadly attacks on and near hospitals in Gaza, and associated combat, pushed the healthcare system to the brink of total collapse, with catastrophic effect on Pales­tinians’ access to health and medical care,” the UN human rights office said in a statement.\n\nIts 23-page report, entitled “Attacks on hospitals during the escalation of hostilities in Gaza”, looked at the period from Oct 7, 2023 to June 30, 2024.\n\nIt said that during this time, there were at least 136 strikes on 27 hospitals and 12 other medical facilities, claiming significant casualties among doctors, nurses, medics and other civilians and causing significant damage to, if not the complete destruction of, civilian infrastructure.\n\n‘Death trap’\n\nThe report noted that medical personnel and hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law, provided they do not commit, or are not used to commit, acts harmful to the enemy outside their humanitarian function.\n\nIt found that Israel’s repeated claims that Gaza hospitals were being improperly used for military purposes by Palestinian groups “vague”. “Insufficient information has so far been made publicly available to substantiate these allegations, which have remained vague and broad, and in some cases appear contradicted by publicly available information,” the report said.\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk said Gaza hospitals had become a “death trap”. “As if the relentless bombing and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza were not enough, the one sanctuary where Palestinians should have felt safe in fact became a death trap,” he said.\n\n“The protection of hospitals during warfare is paramount and must be respected by all sides, at all times.”\n\nCall for investigations\n\nIsrael’s military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 45,500 people, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory’s health ministry that the UN considers reliable.\n\nThe report concluded with a call for credible investigations into the incidents detailed, and said they had to be independent given the “limitations” of Israel’s justice system in respect of the conduct of its armed forces.\n\n“It is essential that there be independent, thorough and transparent investigations of all of these incidents, and full accountability for all violations of international humanitarian and human rights law which have taken place,” said Turk.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
