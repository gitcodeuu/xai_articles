  "content": "KATHMANDU: About a dozen nuns performed hand chops and high kicks, some of them wielding swords, as they showed off their martial art skills to hundreds of cheering wellwishers at the long-awaited reopening of their nunnery in Nepal.\n\nThe nuns of the hill-top Druk Amitabha Monastery, put on the show of strength to mark the institution’s reopening five years after the Covid-19 pandemic forced it to close its doors to the public.\n\nThe group of kung fu nuns, aged from 17 to 30, are members of the 1,000 year-old Drukpa lineage, which gives nuns equal status as monks and is the only female order in the patriarchal Buddhist monastic system.\n\nUsually, nuns are expected to cook and clean and are not allowed to practise any form of martial art.\n\nBut His Holiness Gyalwang Drukpa, a monk who ranks only slightly below the Dalai Lama in the Tibetan Buddhist hierarchy, decided to train women in kung fu to improve their health and spiritual well-being.\n\nHe opened the nunnery in 2009 and it now has 300 members aged between six and 54.\n\n“We do kung fu to keep ourselves mentally and physically fit, and our aim is to promote women’s empowerment and gender equality,” said Jigme Jangchub Chosdon, 23, a nun who is originally from Ladakh in India.\n\nThe nuns come from Bhutan, India and Nepal and are all trained in kung fu, the Chinese martial art for self-defence and strength.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
