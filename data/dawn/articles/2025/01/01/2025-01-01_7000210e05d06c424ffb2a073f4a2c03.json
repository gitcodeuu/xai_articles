  "content": "BRISBANE: Novak Djokovic and Aryana Sabalenka began their season with straight set wins but Nick Kyrgios’ return to singles action did not go according to his plans at the Brisbane International on Tuesday.\n\nDjokovic tamed local favourite Rinky Hijikata 6-3, 6-3 in what was the top seeded Serbian’s first tour-level singles match since October.\n\nThe 37-year-old Serb broke Hijikata once in the first set and twice in the second for a comfortable 74-minute win.\n\nDjokovic, now ranked seven in the world, was all business against the young Australian and always looked in control.\n\n“He did some good things, he played with confidence.\n\nDjokovic was precise with his serve and groundstrokes as he outclassed Hijikata to set up a second round clash with Gael Monfils.\n\n“I always expect myself to do well on the court,” Djokovic said in an on-court interview. “To start off the new season with a win, it’s very important.\n\n“But Hijikata was really good tonight and he made me work for it.”\n\nEarlier, Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard of France fired 36 aces to beat Kyrgios 7-6(2), 6-7(4), 7-6(3) in a battle of big servers at the Pat Rafter Arena.\n\nThe 21-year-old Perricard struck eight forehand winners in the first set alone and served a game of aces to go 5-4 ahead in the third in what was Kyrgios’ first tour-level match since a wrist surgery in September 2023.\n\nPerricard claimed two mini-breaks in the decisive tie-break to claim victory showing tremendous poise under pressure.\n\nAhead of the Australian Open starting on Jan 12, big-serving Perricard said Kyrgios had shown enough to suggest that his comeback would be a success.\n\n“Playing Nick here wasn’t a good match-up for me,” Perricard said, asked about playing Kyrgios in front of his home crowd.\n\n“It was very exciting to play this one, and I’m very happy to get the win. I knew it was going to be a serve match. I hope I will have a nice recovery and be back in two days,” added Perricard, who faces American fourth seed Frances Tiafoe next.\n\nWomen’s world number one Sabalenka sent an ominous warning on her season debut with a 6-4, 6-0 demolition of Renata Zarazua.\n\nThe Belarusian, though, appeared bothered by the high humidity on Pat Rafter Arena as she committed some fouls in the first set but after breaking Mexico’s Zarazua at 5-4, the 26-year-old surged through the second set to wrap up the match in 65 minutes.\n\nThe Belarusian has been working on her new groundstrokes and Mexican Zarazua found herself on the firing line as Sabalenka reeled off 23 winners and won 71 per cent of her service points.\n\n“The first match is always a tricky one,” said Sabalenka, who is coming off a stellar season and will begin her quest for a third Australian Open title later this month.\n\n“It was a tricky start for me but I’m glad that I closed the first set. Then in the second set it felt like whatever I would do would work so I’m really happy with the first win of the season.”\n\nArmenian Elina Avanesyan pulled off a shock 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 win against fourth seed Paula Badosa to make the third round.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
