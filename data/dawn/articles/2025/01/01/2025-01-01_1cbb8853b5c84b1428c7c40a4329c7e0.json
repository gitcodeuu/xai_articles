Whoever is armed and qualified to join the defence ministry, we will welcome them,” he said.\n\n“Under these terms and conditions, we will open a negotiations dialogue with the SDF… to perhaps find an appropriate solution.”\n\nAbu Qasra, 41, a former agronomist, led the armed wing of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) for five years.\n\nOn Sunday, Abu Qasra was given the rank of general in a decree from HTS chief Ahmed al-Sharaa, now Syria’s de facto leader.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
