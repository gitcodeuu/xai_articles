He pointed out that despite having electricity generation in 29 village councils of Allai tehsil, not a single electric pole had been installed to supply power to the area. This, he believes, is a clear injustice to the people of the area, who are being denied the benefits of their own resources.\n\nMeanwhile, the residents of Swat on Tuesday expressed their frustration with unannounced and prolonged power outages, which have severely disrupted their lives and livelihoods.\n\nThe unscheduled loadshedding has affected households and businesses alike, leaving the community grappling with mounting challenges. They said it was for the first time they experienced prolonged power cuts during winter.\n\n“We cannot even complete our daily tasks like washing clothes, ironing, or cooking on time,” said Aisha Bibi, a homemaker from Mingora. “This loadshedding has made our lives so difficult, especially in winter when we need electricity for heating.”\n\nThe impact extends beyond homes, with local businesses taking a significant hit. Tailors, who depend on electricity for their sewing machines, are among those most affected. “We are unable to complete our customers’ orders on time,” lamented Sajid Khan, a tailor in Mingora Bazaar. “Frequent outages mean that our machines remain idle for hours, which damages our reputation and income.”\n\nSimilarly, owners of computer shops have raised concerns over the disruption to their operations. “We can’t provide basic services like printing, photocopying, or computer repairs,” said Farhan Ali, who runs a small computer shop in Swat Market. “Our customers leave dissatisfied, and it’s becoming increasingly difficult to sustain our businesses.”\n\nResidents have urged authorities to address the issue promptly and ensure scheduled loadshedding with prior announcements. “We understand the energy crisis, but at least we should be informed about the timings,” said Khalid Mehmood, a local trader.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
