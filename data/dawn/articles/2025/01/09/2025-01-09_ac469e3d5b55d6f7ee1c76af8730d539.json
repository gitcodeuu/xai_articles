The international community must collaborate to devise a comprehensive plan for its eradication.”\n\nThe interior minister also emphasised Pakistan’s strict stance on illegal immigration, declaring that no unauthorised foreign nationals would be allowed to reside in the country.\n\nFurthermore, Ambassador Blome expressed gratitude for the support he received from Pakistani institutions during his tenure, acknowledging their cooperation in facilitating diplomatic efforts.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Federal Secretary of Interior Khurram Ali Agha and US Deputy Head of Mission Natalie Baker.",
