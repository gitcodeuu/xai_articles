Khan, research analyst at the Institute of Regional Studies, claimed that the state’s counterterrorism policy was not holistic. There is a need to involve local communities besides focusing on kinetic operations, he added.\n\nJournalist Azaz Syed said that final decision-making to resolve the conflict should be done by parliament and civilian authorities, recalling how a civilian government had decided to initiate the Swat operation to curb militancy, which had brought long-lasting peace to the area.\n\nCentre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) Executive Director Imtiaz Gul was of the view that Pakistan had an ad hoc policy when it came to dealing with terrorism and militancy. “We are not extinguishing [the] fire but doing spot-fixing,” he said, adding that Pakistan’s Afghanistan policy should be led by civilians.\n\nIn his concluding remarks, PIPS President Muhammad Amir Rana opposed the idea of restarting talks with the outlawed TTP, saying that dialogue gave political and moral legitimacy to militancy and provided fuel to it.\n\n“TTP is an existential threat for Pakistan and there should be zero tolerance for the group,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 9th, 2025",
