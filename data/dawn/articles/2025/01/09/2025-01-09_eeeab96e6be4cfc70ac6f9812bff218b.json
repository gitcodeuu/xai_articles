Therefore, under the circumstance, the secretary education and secretary schools government of Balochistan are jointly and severally directed that no permission shall be granted for political gathering and activities within the premises of the educational institutions and same shall be completely banned till further order.”\n\nThe court directed the government that the “orders may strictly be observed in letter and spirit and in case of any violation, disciplinary proceedings under Balochistan Employees Efficiency and Discipline Act 2011 would be initiated against the responsible head of the institution”.\n\nThe Balochistan government issued official notification following the BHC order and imposed complete a ban on all kinds of political activities in all government educational institutions with an immediate effect.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 9th, 2025",
