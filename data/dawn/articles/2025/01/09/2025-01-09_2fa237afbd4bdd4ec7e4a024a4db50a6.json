  "content": "KARACHI: City Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Wednesday said he would seek a nod of approval from Islamabad to use the land of Pakistan Railways on I.I. Chundrigar Road to build a car park to ease traffic congestion in the locality.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, the mayor expressed the hope that funds from the Centre for city development would be released and that the prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, would soon announce funding for the betterment of Karachi.\n\n“I plan to discuss with the prime minister the possibility of creating a parking space on railway land around I.I. Chundrigar Road,” he said while responding to a question after inaugurating newly constructed roads, sewerage systems, and footpaths in Nazimabad No.4, Nazimabad No.2 and Gharibabad.\n\nHe gave the example of a Bolton Market dispute. He said, “After we resolved this issue, it led to 25 new offices and significant revenue to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. A whole floor in Bolton Market now allows parking for 300 vehicles. This idea can be replicated to other places where traffic management due to shortage of parking is a serious challenge.”\n\nInaugurates newly constructed roads in district Central\n\nHe also referred to the issue of heavy traffic passing through Korangi Road, Landhi, and Shahra-i-Pakistan reiterating his stance that those vehicles should be directed to the Lyari Expressway.\n\n“We have moved that proposal with all due honesty and sincerity but unfortunately Mustafa Kamal [senior leader of Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan] opposed this idea,” he added.\n\nWhen asked about the recent incident in which a child drowned after falling into an uncovered manhole, he held the representatives of the union committee concerned responsible for the death.\n\n“The UC chairman should take the responsibility,” said Mayor Wahab.\n\n“He now receives Rs1.2 million every month. Isn’t it enough to cover the manholes? It’s very unfortunate but true that manhole covers are stolen and then they’re sold in the scrap market. I have asked the police to please regulate the scrap market.”\n\nHe said 2025 would be the year of development in Karachi. Development schemes worth Rs250 million had been completed in Central district, he claimed.\n\n“The public convenience projects are our primary focus,” he said, adding: “The Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) does not have any of the five towns in Central district, but development work is still being carried out because solving problems of Karachi residents is our duty.”\n\nHe said multiple development works had been completed in Central district, including repair of roads from Liaquatabad to Teen Hatti, improvements to the sewage system, and installation of pure blocks and carpeting at various locations.\n\n“Similar work is progressing rapidly on projects like Shahrah-i-Noor Jahan and Sangam Ground.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 9th, 2025",
