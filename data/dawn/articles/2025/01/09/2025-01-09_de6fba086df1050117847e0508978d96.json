Khaled, who heads the Snowtex company, employing 22,000 workers.\n\nThe South Asian nation produces garments for global brands — ranging from France’s Carrefour, Canada’s Tire, Japan’s Uniqlo, Ireland’s Primark, Sweden’s H&M and Spain’s Zara.\n\nThe apparel industry accounts for about 80 per cent of Bangladesh’s exports, earning $36 billion last year, dropping little despite the unrest from the $38 billion exported the previous year.\n\n“I am working with at least 15 international brands, and our products will be available in 50 countries,” Khaled said.\n\n“Almost all garment factories are operating at full swing after waves of unrest. We are on the growth side.”\n\nDespite challenges with a cooling of demand, Anwar Hossain, the government-appointed administrator of BGMEA, said the industry was returning to strength.\n\n“The largest contributor to exports was the apparel sector,” Hossain said.\n\nThe garment industry recorded a 13 per cent increase from July-December 2024 — the period after the revolution — compared to the same period the year before, he said.\n\nWorkers tell a different story.\n\nKhatun welcomed the wage rise but said factory managers then hiked already onerous demands for “nearly unachievable production targets”.\n\nScraping by in the capital Dhaka’s gritty industrial suburb of Ashulia, she earns $140 a month including overtime and benefits to support a family of four.\n\nThe wage increase of $8.25 a month seems a miserly addition.\n\nOpening her fist, she showed a 500-taka note, just over four dollars, all she had left after paying rent and other expenses.\n\n“We have good facilities inside the factory, like toilets, a canteen, and water fountains,” she said. “But we don’t get even a 10-minute break while trying to meet the targets”.\n\nMany factory owners were close to the former ruling party.\n\nIn the immediate days after Hasina was toppled, several factories were damaged in retaliatory attacks.\n\nSome owners were arrested and accused of supporting Hasina, who is herself in exile in India skipping an arrest warrant for “massacres, killings, and crimes against humanity”.\n\n“We weren’t receiving salaries on time after the owner was arrested,” said worker Rana, also asking not to be identified.\n\n“Now, they’ve offered me half my basic wage, around $60 to $70. I have a six-month-old child, a wife, and elderly parents to support”, he added.\n\nHussain, who lost his job in the unrest, tells a common tale.\n\nWhile he has since found work packing clothes, the new job means he “doesn’t benefit from the increment” deal, while living costs have risen.\n\n“House rents have shot up with the news of the pay rise,” he said.\n\nTaslima Akhter, from the Bangladesh Garment Workers’ Solidarity (BGWS) group, a labour rights organisation, said that “workers are struggling to maintain a minimum standard of living”.\n\nAkhter said factory bosses must push back against global purchasers wanting to maximise profits at the expense of a living wage.\n\n“Garment (factory) owners need to take more responsibility and learn to negotiate better with international buyers,” she said.\n\n“This industry is not new, and problems are not impossible to solve.”",
