Greenland is associated with the European Union through Denmark, of which it is a self-governing territory, but withdrew from the European bloc in 1985 after securing autonomy.\n\n“If you ask me: ‘Is the United States going to invade Greenland?’ the answer is no,” said Barrot.\n\nIn Berlin, German government spokesman Steffen Hebestreit said that “as always, the firm principle applies […] that borders must not be moved by force”.\n\nThe “Gulf of Mexico” name is internationally recognised, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said in response to Trump’s comments about renaming the body of water. Trump had argued in favour of renaming the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America”. Sheinbaum then took jabs at Trump, saying he was living in the past.\n\n“I think they told President (elect) Trump wrong, they told him Felipe Calderon is still president,” Sheinbaum said. Calderon led Mexico from 2006 to 2012. “But no, in Mexico the people are in charge,” she added.\n\nIn a press conference, Sheinbaum showed a map of Mexico’s former size, which includes land now part of the US. “Mexican America, that sounds nice,” she said.\n\nIn Copenhagen, Denmark’s foreign minister said they were open to talks with Washington to safeguard US interests in the Arctic.\n\nThe Danish Realm — which includes Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands — is “open to a dialogue with the Americans on how we can cooperate, possibly even more closely than we already do”, Lars Lokke Rasmussen said\n\nThere is a “snowball’s chance in hell” that Canada will merge with the United States, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau responded.\n\nPanama’s Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha meanwhile said “the sovereignty of our canal is not negotiable.”\n\nBuilt by the US, the Panama Canal was handed to the Central American country a quarter-century ago.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 9th, 2025",
