I pray to god to give peace to the departed souls,” Prem Kumar Jain, spokesman of the state’s ruling Telugu Desam Party, told reporters.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi offered condolences to the families of the deceased.\n\n“My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones,” his office said on social media platform X.\n\nDeadly accidents are common at places of worship in India during major religious festivals due to poor crowd management and safety lapses.\n\nIn July last year, 121 people were killed in northern Uttar Pradesh state during a Hindu religious gathering.\n\nAnother 112 people died in 2016 after a huge explosion caused by a banned fireworks display marking the Hindu new year at a temple in southern Kerala state.\n\nWednesday’s incident comes days before the start of the Kumbh Mela, a six-week Hindu festival of prayer and sacred bathing expected to be the largest religious gathering in history. Up to 400 million pilgrims are expected to attend, according to organisers.",
