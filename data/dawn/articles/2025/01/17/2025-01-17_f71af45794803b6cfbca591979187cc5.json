The total includes 34 captives the Israeli military has declared dead.\n\nAn Israeli spokesman said on Tuesday Israel was “prepared to pay a heavy price -- in the hundreds” in exchange for the 33 Israelis.\n\nIsrael is to release about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, including those with “lengthy sentences”.\n\nIsraeli positions in Gaza\n\nDuring the initial, 42-day ceasefire Israeli forces will withdraw from Gaza and remain positio­ned on its border to “allow for the swap of prisoners, as well as the swap of remains and the return of the displaced people”, Qatar’s prime minister said.\n\nNegotiations for a second phase would commence on the “16th day” after the first phase’s implementation.\n\nBuffer zone\n\nIsraeli media reported that under the proposed deal, Israel would maintain a buffer zone within Gaza during the first phase.\n\nIsraeli forces were expected to remain up to “800 metres inside Gaza stretching from Rafah in the south to Beit Hanun in the north”.\n\nIsraeli forces would not fully withdraw from Gaza until all prisoners are returned.\n\nIsrael is to allow the movement of residents from southern Gaza to the north.\n\nMonitoring\n\nJoint mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt will monitor the ceasefire deal through a body based in Cairo.\n\nThere is “a clear mechanism to negotiate phases two and three”, Sheikh Mohammed added.\n\nUnder the arrangements outlined by Qatar, the details of phases two and three will be “finalised” during the implementation of phase one.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2025",
