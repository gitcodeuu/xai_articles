All political and religious parties will work jointly for the political rights of the region, it added.\n\nThe speakers expressed that the financial issues of the reg­ion required urgent attention for which stakeholders needed to make “sincere effo­rts beyond political differences”.\n\nThe declaration demanded the implementation of proposals made by federal ministers late Sartaj Aziz and Farogh Naseem regarding the provisional constitutional province status of GB.\n\nThe two former ministers headed committees formed by the PML-N and PTI governments, respectively, to grant GB the provisional status of a province.\n\nOther speakers also urged the federal government to settle the constitutional status of the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2025",
