Since the sample was collected in Dece­m­­ber last year, the case has been categorised as part of last year’s tally. The incubation period for the sample is nearly three weeks, which can extend further during the winter season,” the official explained.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that while hundreds of samples are received at the lab, only a few test positive for the virus, and it takes about three weeks to confirm whether a child is infected with polio.\n\n“Pakistan has been res­ponding to a significant re­­­surgence of WPV1, with 73 cases reported in 2024. Of these, 27 are from Ba­­lochistan, 22 from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 22 from Sindh and one each from Punjab and Islamabad,” he added.\n\nThe Pakistan Polio Progra­mme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives each year, bringing the vaccine directly to children’s doorsteps.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2025",
