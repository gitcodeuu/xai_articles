Following an initial prisoner exchange, the terms of a permanent end to the war would be finalised.\n\nHowever, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday accused Hamas of “reneg[ing] on parts of the agreement… in an effort to extort last-minute concessions”.\n\nHamas political bureau member Sami Abu Zuhri, meanwhile, said there was “no basis” for Israel’s accusations.\n\nAn Israeli official later told AFP the cabinet was scheduled to meet Friday to decide on the deal.\n\nIsraeli media said the government’s ratification of the agreement may be delayed, in part, by disagreements within the ruling coalition.\n\nTwo far-right party leaders in Netanyahu’s cabinet have publicly opposed the agreement.\n\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said it was a “dangerous deal”, while National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir called it “disastrous”.\n\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has been involved in months of mediation efforts, said he believed the ceasefire would go ahead on schedule.\n\n“I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday,” he said.\n\nThe foreign ministry of fellow mediator Egypt said in a statement the ceasefire must “start without delay”.\n\nThe ceasefire agreement followed intensified efforts from mediators Qatar, Egypt and the United States, after months of fruitless negotiations to end the deadliest war in Gaza’s history.\n\nIf finalised, it would pause hostilities one day before the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump.\n\nIn the first phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza’s densely populated areas and allow displaced Palestinians to return “to their residences”.\n\nThe second phase of the agreement could bring a “permanent end to the war”.\n\nContinued attacks\n\nMeanwhile, Gaza’s civil defence agency said Israel pounded several areas of the territory after the deal was announced, killing at least 80 people and wounding hundreds.\n\nThe Israeli military said it had hit about 50 targets across Gaza since late Wednesday. But Hamas warned that strikes were risking the lives of Israelis who were due to be freed under the deal, and could turn their “freedom… into a tragedy”.\n\nIn Israel and Gaza, there were celebrations welcoming the truce deal, but also anguish.\n\nSaeed Alloush, who lives in north Gaza, said he and his loved ones were “waiting for the truce and were happy”, until overnight strikes killed many of his relatives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 17th, 2025",
