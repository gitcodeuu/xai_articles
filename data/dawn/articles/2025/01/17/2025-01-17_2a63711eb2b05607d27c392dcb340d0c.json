The couple has denied any wrongdoing.\n\nImran faces anti-terrorism charges in connection with the violence that followed his arrest on May 9, 2023, regarding which several of his supporters have already been sentenced.\n\nIn December, he was indicted in a case concerning an attack during the protests on the army’s General Head­quarters in Rawalpindi and is on trial.\n\nImran was accused of making public a classified cable sent to Islamabad by Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington in 2022, while he still held office.\n\nHe was acquitted in the case in June 2024.\n\nImran and his wife were accused of breaking Islamic law by failing to observe the mandated waiting period between Bushra’s divorce from her previous husband and their marriage in 2018.\n\nThey were acquitted of the charges in July.",
