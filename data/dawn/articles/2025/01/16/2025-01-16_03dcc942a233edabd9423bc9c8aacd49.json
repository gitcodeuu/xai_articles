They led the group equipped with weapons to the police checkpost, however, the assailants had already fled the area.\n\nThe country has lately witnessed a sharp uptick in the number of attacks targeting security forces, other law enforcement agencies, and security checkpoints, particularly in Balochistan and KP.\n\nPolice checkpoints in remote areas of Shangla district are noted to be vulnerable to terrorist attacks due to their location in isolated regions surrounded by forests.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a senior police officer criticised the construction of the check-posts in isolated locations.\n\nIn another attack, on Dec 17, over 30 terrorists stormed a police checkpost in Gunangar area of Chakesar, which is located around 10 kilometres from the Karakoram Highway in Dandai area. The attack left an assistant sub-inspect and a constable dead, and caused injuries to three others.\n\nThe Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) Malakand division accepted responsibility for the attack, confirming it on their social media account. They also warned that they would hit more targets in the near future in Shangla and other parts of the region.",
