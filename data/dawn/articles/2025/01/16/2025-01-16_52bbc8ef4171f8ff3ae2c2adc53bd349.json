  "content": "LAHORE: The Punjab cabinet has approved a four-point agenda of the forest department, including the inclusion of “big cats” in Schedule-II of the Wildlife Act of 1974, says Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb.\n\nKeeping of five species of big cats – lions, cheetahs, tigers, pumas, and jaguars – have been regulated under the law.\n\n“There had been no legislation for the past 70 years regarding the keeping of these animals, leading to their presence in homes. A strict ban has been imposed on displaying these animals on TikTok or other social media platforms. Violators will face legal action,” Ms Aurangzeb said on Wednesday.\n\nThe wildlife department will now issue a possession licence for these beast, with a fee of Rs50,000 per animal. Minimum standards have been established for keeping them, and they must be housed outside city limits. Owners will be given time to relocate these animals and failure to comply will result in legal action and FIRs.\n\nUnder the amended Punjab Forest Transit Rules 2024, checkpoints will be set up at key locations, and the transportation of forest products between sunset and sunrise has been declared illegal.\n\nForest officers have been empowered to shut down depots and impose fines for violations.\n\nNew Forest Depot Rules 2024 mandate that the establishment of depots requires approval from the divisional forest officer (DFO), and depot owners must get their annual registrations renewed.\n\nThe new rules prohibit establishment of sawmills or coal kilns within five miles of forest boundaries.\n\nA special squad will be formed to ensure the implementation of the new regulations, replacing the outdated Forest Depot Rules of 2013.\n\n“The new rules aim to prevent illegal transportation of forest products, promote transparency, and protect forest resources. Prohibition of transportation after sunset is a significant step toward long-term environmental protection,” the minister said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2025",
