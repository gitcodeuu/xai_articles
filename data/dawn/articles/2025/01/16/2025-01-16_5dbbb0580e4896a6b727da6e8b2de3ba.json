Danial Iqbal had been nominated in the murder case of a man identified as Abdul Rehman.\n\nSources confirmed that 35-year-old property dealer Abdul Rehman was gunned down by his rivals in Gujar Khan.\n\nShortly after the incident, the injured were rushed to Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) where Raja Iqbal Danial succumbed to his injuries while his guard was stated to be in critical condition.\n\nA Rawalpindi police spokesperson said that police officials from the Civil Lines police station reached the spot and collected evidence from the crime scene.\n\nAccording to the initial investigation, the incident stemmed from an old enmity.\n\nHowever, the police will probe the case from various angles, he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2025",
