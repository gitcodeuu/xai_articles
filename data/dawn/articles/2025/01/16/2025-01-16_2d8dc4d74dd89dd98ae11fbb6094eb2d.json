They will be released shortly. Thank you!” Trump said on his Truth Social network, before any official announcement from outgoing President Joe Biden’s White House.\n\n“This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November,” Trump added in a lengthy second post.\n\nEU Commissioner for the Mediterranean Dubravka Suica hailed the ceasefire deal, saying the bloc “remains committed to supporting all efforts towards a long-lasting peace and recovery”.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, to halt fighting in Gaza, is an important step for regional stability.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ankara, Fidan also said Turkish efforts for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict will continue.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez on Wednesday welcomed the news, saying it “is crucial to achieving regional stability”.\n\n“This ceasefire opens the door to a permanent end to the war and to the improvement of the poor humanitarian situation in Gaza,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on X.\n\nWelcoming the ceasefire deal, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi pointed to the “importance of accelerating the entry of urgent humanitarian aid” into Gaza.\n\nMeanwhile, Egyptian state media reported that coordination was underway to “open the Palestinian Rafah crossing to allow the entry of international aid” into Gaza.\n\nEgypt was “preparing to bring in the largest possible amount of aid to the Gaza Strip”, the report said.\n\nIf successful, the planned phased ceasefire could halt fighting that has left much of Gaza in ruins, displaced most of the enclave’s pre-war population of 2.3 million.\n\nThat in turn could defuse tensions across the wider Middle East, where the war has stoked conflict in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, in Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iraq, and raised fears of all-out war between arch regional foes Israel and Iran.\n\nWhat next?\n\nIf all goes smoothly, the Palestinians, Arab states and Israel still must agree on a vision for post-war Gaza, a formidable challenge involving security guarantees for Israel and billions of dollars in investment for rebuilding.\n\nOne unanswered question is who will run Gaza after the war.\n\nIsrael has rejected any involvement by Hamas, which had ruled Gaza since 2007, but it has been almost equally opposed to rule by the Palestinian Authority, the body set up under the Oslo interim peace accords.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 16th, 2025",
