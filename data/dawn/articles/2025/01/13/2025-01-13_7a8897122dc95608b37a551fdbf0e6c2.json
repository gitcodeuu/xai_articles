  "content": "KARACHI: The Jamaat-i-Islami on Sunday staged a big rally to express solidarity with the people of Gaza and condemn Israeli atrocities against innocent civilians.\n\nA large number of JI workers and supporters, including women and children, reached Nishan-i-Pakistan, Seaview, from different parts of the metropolis to participate in the ‘Gaza March’.\n\nCarrying banners, placards and flags of Palestine, the participants chanted slogans against Israel and the countries supporting the Zionist regime in what they called carrying out the “genocide” of Pale­stinians.\n\nAddressing the participants, JI-Karachi chief Monem Zafar said Palestinians have been facing Israeli atrocities for the past 450 days and yet a majority of world powers and Muslim countries have chosen to remain silent over the crimes against humanity in Gaza.\n\n“There are 57 Islamic countries in the world, with seven million soldiers, equipped with state-of-the-art weaponry as well as resources but unfortunately they all lack courage and dignity,” he said.\n\n“The tragedy unfolded in Gaza has divided the world into two poles: the people of conscience and the followers of might. The people of conscience have been protesting and raising their voice across the globe and even in Tel Aviv, against Israeli apartheid, whereas on the other the US and other friends of Israel have been supporting the bloodbath in Gaza,” he said.\n\nHe demanded that the government take concrete steps on international level to reduce the sufferings of the Gazans.\n\nPraising the participants for expressing solidarity with Palestinians, the JI leader urged Karachiites to continue their boycott of “Israeli products” and asked the youth to raise voice for Palestinians on social media.\n\nPalestine Foundation President Sabir Abu Maryam, former caretaker Sindh health minister Saad Khalid Niaz and others also spoke.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 13th, 2025",
