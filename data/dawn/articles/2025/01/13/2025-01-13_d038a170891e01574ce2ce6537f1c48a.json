  "content": "STRASBOURG: The toll from a collision of two trams in Strasbourg has risen to 68 injured in a rare accident that sowed panic near the eastern French city’s main train station, authorities said on Sunday.\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, a stationary tram at the underground stop at Strasbourg’s main railway station was violently hit by another tram, which began to move backwards for unknown reasons. The moving tram, which had stopped due to a traffic jam, reversed and rolled down a slope leading to the station. Both trams carried dozens of passengers.\n\nAs a result of the collision, 68 people were injured, according to the prefecture, which released an updated toll Sunday. Around a hundred people escaped unharmed.\n\nThe collision occurred near Strasbourg’s main train station, one of the busiest in France outside of Paris.\n\nVideo footage posted online showed chaotic scenes with the two trams significantly damaged, an alarm going off and people screaming. “The tram set off again at full speed towards the station,” said Romaric Koumba, one of the passengers.\n\n“As we were setting off again towards the station, we realised that there was already another tram that had returned to the station. This tram was at a standstill, thank God,” said Romaric Koumba, one of the passengers. “When the tram collided with the other one, the doors flew off,” he added.\n\nAnother witness, Johan Kirschenbaum, said the moving train apparently had a problem with the brakes. “We heard a big impact, a big bang,” he said.\n\n‘Very shocked’ drivers\n\nOn Saturday, Rene Cellier, director of the Bas-Rhin fire and rescue service, said that around 50 people suffered non-fatal injuries such as scalp wounds, clavicle fractures, and knee sprains. “Mostly trauma,” Cellier said. Cellier said that the situation “could have been much more serious”.\n\nThe public prosecutor’s office said an investigation into “unintentional injuries” had been opened, with the aim of determining the cause of the accident and identifying any criminal liability. Prosecutors said the collision was not deliberate. “An initial investigation has ruled out the hypothesis of an intentional act,” said Alexandre Chevrier, the acting public prosecutor.\n\nThe two drivers were not injured but were “very shocked,” said the director of the Strasbourg transport company (CTS), Emmanuel Auneau. Tram traffic at the railway station has been suspended for several days, the company said.\n\nJulien Joly, a transport and mobility expert at the consulting firm Wavestone, said collisions between trams were rare.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 13th, 2025",
