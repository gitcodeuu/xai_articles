This would include the Philadelphi Corridor, the 14km-long strip of land spanning the border between Gaza and Egypt.\n\nEarlier, Jake Sullivan told CNN’s ‘State of the Union’ programme that the parties were “very, very close” to reaching a deal to halt the fighting in the enclave and free the remaining 98 prisoners held there, but still had to get it across the finish line.\n\nBiden was getting daily updates on the talks in Doha, where Israeli and Palestinian officials have said since Thursday that some progress has been made in the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, Sullivan said.\n\n“We are still determined to use every day we have in office to get this done,” he said, adding that Biden “is likely, in the near term, to engage with Prime Minister Netanyahu, and we are not, by any stretch of imagination, setting this aside”.\n\nHe said there was still a chance to reach an agreement before Biden leaves office, but that it was also possible “Hamas, in particular, remains intransigent”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 13th, 2025",
