  "content": "KHUZDAR: Traffic between Quetta and Karachi remained suspended on Sunday as a large number of protesters blocked the highway in the Anjira area of Khuzdar district, demanding the release of individuals arrested in connection with a recent militant attack in Zehri tehsil.\n\nSecurity forces earlier detained over a dozen people from Zehri after armed militants attacked government buildings, including the Levies station, the offices of Nadra, the municipal committee and a private bank.\n\nThe arrests prompted a large protest by the relatives of the detainees and other residents, who blocked the key highway linking Sindh and Balochistan by erecting barricades and placing large boulders on the road.\n\nThe protest caused traffic disruptions, leaving numerous vehicles, including passenger coaches and goods trucks, stranded on both sides of the highway.\n\nThe protesters established a sit-in camp on the highway, refusing to allow vehicles to pass.\n\nThey have demanded the immediate release of all arrested individuals and vowed to continue their protest until their demands were met.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 13th, 2025",
