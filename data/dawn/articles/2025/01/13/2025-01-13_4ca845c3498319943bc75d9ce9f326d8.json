The movement is regularly accused of anti-Semitism by Israel and its key backer the United States.\n\nBarghouti has previously said that the movement “categorically opposes all forms of racism, including Islamophobia and anti-Semitism”.\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Omar talked about the history of Palestinian non-violent resistance, its legacy, and its effectiveness in defending Palestinian rights.\n\nSpeaking on the origin of the BDS movement, he highlighted the movement’s calls for: self-determination, ending occupation, and the right of refugees to return.\n\nHe said, “By focusing on those three rights BDS addresses the basic rights stipulated under international law.”\n\nAmid Israel’s ongoing assault in Gaza, the movement gained momentum across all corners of the world but it was also under increased scrutiny and threats from Israel’s allies.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused BDS supporters of practising antisemitism in 2014 stating that the movement was intended to lead to “the end of the Jewish state”, according to The Guardian.\n\nWhen asked about the criticism, Barghouti responded, “Look who is talking.”\n\n“Israel’s leaders are nourishing antisemitism like never before. They’re in bed with the fascists of the world,” he stated, adding that Israeli leaders have close ties to fascists like “crazy Christian Zionist zealots in the US” who were “anti-semitic, but they love Israel.”\n\nBarghouti further said, “BDS targets Israel’s regime of oppression. It does not target an identity as such.”\n\nHe stated: “Saying that attacking Israel or Zionism is anti-semitic, is an anti-Semitic statement [in itself] because it equates Israel and Zionism with all Jews.”\n\nReferring to what was happening in Gaza, he said “It is an Israeli policy, far-right fascist government in Israel. It has nothing to do with Jewishness or Judaism.”\n\nOn facing intimidation and threats, Barghouti said, “I’m louder than ever, so it’s not working. Yes, they’ve tried everything.\n\n“My response to every phase of intimidation is, do more.”\n\nHe also highlighted the support for the movement by the Jewish community stating, “They understand that there is nothing Jewish about Israel’s occupation, settler colonialism, ethnic cleansing, apartheid or genocide, and therefore, there’s nothing anti-Jewish in supporting BDS to dismantle those systems, those structures of oppression and those crimes.”\n\nThe BDS co-founder said that the movement “connects the Palestinian liberation struggle with ending complicity internationally, which means we cannot end the occupation … without ending the complicity of states, corporations and institutions. So in a nutshell, the theory of change of the BDS movement is from the grassroots to the grass tops.”\n\nHe added, “We need to build people power, which has many forms: intersectional coalitions, media power, strategic litigation power, the ability to peacefully disrupt the powers that be, and so on.”\n\nHe also discusses the role of Western countries such as the US, UK, and Germany in aiding Israel, saying, “Without those links of complicity, Israel cannot maintain its entire system of oppression.”\n\nEnding those “links of complicity” can strengthen the Palestinian resistance more effectively against the system of oppression and eventually dismantle it, he added.\n\nHe cited the examples of India, Algeria and South Africa where people were able to defeat powerful regimes of oppression. He said, “And it took a lot of international solidarity. It wasn’t just the internal resistance. External solidarity is also very integral to this resistance.”\n\nOn the success of the movement, he said, “We are successfully challenging powers that be.”\n\nHe highlighted the Norwegian sovereign fund which recently divested its $500 million worth of Israeli bonds under pressure from the largest trade union in Norway, which is a BDS supporter.\n\nBarghouti also mentioned Intel which canceled a project of investing $25 billion near Tel Aviv, 15 miles from Gaza.\n\nPUMA, another international company, ended sponsorship with the Israel Football Association in Dec last year after it was named in the global boycott campaign in 2018.",
