  "content": "ISLAMABAD: PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui, who is also the spokesperson for the government’s negotiation committee, said the dialogue committee will not dissolve on January 31 — the PTI’s deadline for the acceptance of demands — as he underscored the importance of achieving meaningful outcomes over rigidly adhering to deadlines.\n\n“A positive outcome is our priority, not merely meeting a deadline,” he said in interviews with various media outlets on Tuesday.\n\nSenator Siddiqui explained that the seven political parties represented in the government’s negotiation committee needed time to consult their respective leadership before formulating a unified response to PTI’s demands.\n\nHe hoped that the PTI would present its demands in the next meeting on Jan 16, after which the government committee would respond accordingly.\n\nSenator Siddiqui also described the demands of the PTI as “complex and of significant gravity”.\n\nHe clarified that while the government committee had not made any demands so far, it might propose certain suggestions if the dialogue process moved forward smoothly.\n\nHe also addressed concerns about civil disobedience and social media campaigns, clarifying that the government committee had not asked the PTI to call off such activities or cease negative social media rhetoric.\n\nMr Siddiqui cautioned that tweets and statements detrimental to the dialogue process should be avoided.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2025",
