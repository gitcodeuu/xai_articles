The case is being heard by a seven-judge Constitutional Bench.\n\nSenior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the Ministry of Defence, informed the court that no serving military officers had been charged over the destruction of military installations. He stated that the armed forces exercised restraint as the protesters did not kill or harm any individuals during the violence.\n\nThe counsel explained that even in peacetime, civilians who interfere with military operations or target defence assets could be tried by military courts. He added that the trial of the conspirator or the mastermind would also be conducted by the military court.\n\nHe said that in peacetime, the military was preparing different war strategies, and any encounter, attack or offence against them would be considered a war crime.\n\n“Impairment of duty by the military personnel, even in peacetime, was as severe a crime for violating the sanctity of the defence workplace and endangering the security of the country,” he said.\n\nJustice Musarrat Hilali raised a hypothetical qu­estion about whether a civilian attempting to steal a soldier’s rifle would fall under military jurisdiction, even though their intention was not to disarm the army personnel.\n\nShe further questioned whether the May 9 protesters fully understood the gravity of their actions or were simply going with the flow.\n\nThe counsel explained that such protesters were never tried by the military courts, adding that the intention of any offender would be determined through their conduct and manner of handling things.\n\nReferring to the F.B. Ali case, Justice Rizvi observed that the facts of the case dealt with the time when there was a civil martial law, and since then, an attempt was made to remove Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was then the civil martial law administrator.\n\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed that it was the Supreme Court’s job to determine whether whatever was written in Section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) was right or wrong.\n\nThe sections in question allow for court martial of civilians accused of seducing army officers from their duties or committing offences related to defence establishments.\n\nIn its Oct 23, 2023, jud­g­ement, a five-judge Supre­me Court bench declared these sections as ultra vires (beyond the powers) of the Constitution.\n\nJustice Mandokhail also expressed reservations about expanding the scope of the OSA by integrating it into the PAA without constitutional justification. He questioned whether such an expansion is permissible under the Constitution.\n\nThe counsel cited the 1999 Sheikh Liaquat Hussain case, arguing that the Supreme Court had previously upheld military court trials for civilians with a nexus to the armed forces or national defence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2025",
