Owing to its geographical significance, the province offers trade routes through Gwadar port to Central Asia, Gulf countries, the Middle East, and Europe.\n\n“The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a living testament to this purpose,” he said and emphasised that Balochistan is a land of opportunities for investors, boasting some of the world’s largest mineral reserves, including copper, gold, lead, zinc, iron, and chromite.\n\n“Areas like Reko Diq and Saindak have already garnered global attention due to their substantial production of valuable minerals, while countless untapped sites remain to be explored, offering unparalleled opportunities for discovery and investment,” Mr Kakar informed the diplomats.\n\nHe noted that lucrative investment potential also existed in agriculture, energy, fisheries, and livestock sectors. He assured the ambassadors that foreign companies investing in Balochistan would receive full support and protection from the provincial government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2025",
