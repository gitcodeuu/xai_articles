It took Rescue 1122 fire tenders and workers around an hour to extinguish the blaze.\n\nAn official of Rescue 1122 said the service had repeatedly warned people against burning fires at night or leaving gas heaters on, as the cases of suffocation and fires had increased in recent weeks.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party divisional president Hazara Malik Mohammad Farooq on Tuesday removed the party’s district president and general secretary in Mansehra from their respective offices.\n\n“I have removed both president Malik Mumtaz and general secretary Maqsood Khan over local leaders’ complaints about their misconduct and favouritism in appointments. Their successors will be notified by our [PPP] central chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari within two weeks,” Mr Farooq told reporters here.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2025",
