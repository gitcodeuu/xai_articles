The investigation into the incident has been assigned to the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team, with an emphasis on adopting modern mining safety measures used worldwide in Balochistan’s coal mines.\n\nPresiding over a high-level meeting on Tuesday, the chief minister expressed anger over the failure to implement standard safety measures in coal mining within the province and stressed the importance of ensuring regular inspections at all costs.\n\nCM orders probe, suspension of mines inspector\n\nThe meeting discussed recent mining accidents in Balochistan, and a briefing was provided by the Mines and Minerals Development Department.\n\nThe meeting was attended, among others, by KP Assembly’s opposition leader Dr Ibadullah Khan, provincial Minister for Finance and Mineral Develop­ment Mir Shoaib Nosherwani, Principal Secretary Babar Khan, Special Secretary Mines Mohammad Farooq and PDMA DG Jahanzeb Khan.\n\nReferring to the recent mine accidents, the chief minister expressed concern over the recurring incidents, expressing dissatisfaction with the performance of inspection teams.\n\nHe said there is no justification for inspectors not being able to access the mines due to security concerns.\n\n“If concerned officials are unable to perform their assigned tasks, they should resign and go home,” CM Bugti said, adding that clear accountability should be established for accidents and those responsible must be punished.\n\nHe noted that the second accident at the same company in one year seemingly indicated negligence.\n\nHe directed that the Rescue and Training Wing be equipped with the latest technology and instructed the Mines and Minerals Department to prepare a comprehensive proposal.\n\nCM Bugti also ordered that compensation for workers who died in accidents be paid promptly and that all mine workers be registered with the relevant authority.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2025",
