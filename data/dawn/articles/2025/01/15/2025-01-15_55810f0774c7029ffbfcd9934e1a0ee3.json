The members kept on sloganeering and desk-thumping for nearly 30 minutes before staging a walkout leaving behind MNA Nisar Ahmed to point out lack of quorum.\n\nThe speaker regretted the opposition’s act of pointing out the quorum, stating that it had been agreed in a meeting that the PTI would not point out quorum during the Question Hour and the private member’s day.\n\nIntroduction of bills\n\nPPP lawmaker Shazia Marri introduced a bill seeking to amend the Zakat and Ushr Ordinance 1980 in its application to Islamabad Capital Territory, the Zakat and Ushr (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Capital Development Authority (Amendment) Bill 2025 seeking accessibility for the disabled persons to the buildings in Islamabad.\n\nMNA Sharmila Farooqui introduced the Islamabad Capital Territory Dowry Restraint Bill 2025, seeking to prohibit giving, taking or demanding dowry. She also introduced the Islamabad Animal Protection Bill 2025 aimed at ensuring the natural rights and protection of animals in the capital city.\n\nSehar Kamran of the PPP moved the National Commission on the Rig­hts of Child (Amendment) Bill 2025.\n\nAll the bills were referred to the relevant standing committees by the chair as Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar did not oppose them.\n\nSpeaker’s meeting with opposition\n\nLater, the NA speaker along with treasury members held a meeting with the opposition members in the open space of parliament’s cafeteria.\n\nThose attended the meeting incl­uded deputy speaker Ghulam Must­afa Shah, Syed Khurshid Shah and Naveed Qamar of the PPP, Bilal Azhar Kayani, Malik Abrar and Dr Darshan of the PML-N and Aamir Dogar and Sher Ali Arbab of the PTI.\n\nWhen contacted, PTI’s Asad Qaiser said the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the issue of the selection of the chairman of Public Accounts Committee (PAC). He said the PTI had categorically told the government that the party had nominated Sheikh Waqqas Akram as the PAC chairman and that it would not withdraw his name.\n\nThe PAC has been non-functional since the general elections in February 2024, as the PML-N government wanted the PTI to nominate Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan for the office as per the past tradition in line with the 2006 charter of democracy.\n\nOn the other hand, the PTI has insisted on the name of its firebrand MNA from Jhang Sheikh Waqqas Akram for the key position.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 15th, 2025",
