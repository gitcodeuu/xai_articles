The government and security forces are working hard against the terrorists. There is determination to eliminate terrorism from Pakistan.”\n\nCondemning the attack, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed “deep grief and sorrow over the loss of precious human lives”.\n\nHe further said that “those who target the innocent do not deserve to be called human beings,” adding that he shared in the grief of the families affected by the incident and prayed for the recovery of the wounded.\n\nOne person was injured in a bomb attack on a gas company’s vehicle in Qila Saifullah district on Wednesday. Police officials said terrorists had planned to attack the camp of the Oil and Gas Development Corporation Limited located on the outskirts of Qila Saifullah.\n\nIn November last year, at least 26 people were killed and 62 injured after a suicide blast ripped through a Quetta Railway Station, local authorities and hospital officials said.\n\nPakistan, particularly Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw a sharp uptick in terrorism-related incidents in 2024.\n\nWith at least 685 members of security forces losing their lives amid a total of 444 terror attacks, 2024 turned out to be the deadliest year for civil and military security forces of Pakistan in a decade.\n\nEqually alarming were the cumulative losses of civilians and security personnel: 1,612 fatalities, accounting for over 63pc of the total recorded this year and marking 73pc more losses compared to 934 outlaws eliminated.",
