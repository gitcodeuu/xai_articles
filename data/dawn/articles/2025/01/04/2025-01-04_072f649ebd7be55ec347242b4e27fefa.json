The subsequent unrest claimed over a hundred lives, and created a severe shortage of medicines, edibles and other essentials in the remote parts of the district.\n\nKurram Deputy Commi­ssioner Javed Mehsud told Dawn that following Wednesday’s peace agreement between the warring sides, peace committees comprising local elders and politicians had been formed.\n\nHe said that Lower Kurram’s peace committee would comprise 27 members, including Pir Haider Ali Shah, Haji Faizullah, Hussain Ali Shah Alhussiani and Haji Noor Jaf Ali, while the Upper Kurram peace committee would have 48 members, including Sajid Hussain Turi, MPA Ali Hadi, Muzamil Shah, Syed Kazim Hussain and Syed Wali.\n\nDC Mehsud said that following the guarantees offered by the local peace committees, a convoy carrying edibles and other essential items would leave for Parachinar on Saturday. He said that a police party would protect the convoy, while personnel from other law enforcement agencies would also be on hand to assist police, in case of any eventuality.\n\nHe acknowledged that the prolonged road closures had heaped miseries on locals, who were forced to make do without necessary medicines, food and other daily-use items.\n\nTalking about efforts at disarmament, DC Mehsud said that both sides had been asked for a timetable for the demolition of bunkers and surrendering of arms within a fortnight, adding that all existing bunkers would be demolished within a month.\n\nIn a separate statement, KP\n\nChief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry called on the peace committees to fully support the government and law enforcement agencies in their efforts.\n\nHe said that both the federal and provincial governments would extend all kind of support to ensure the success of the peace agreement. He also called on the peace committees to ensure that no miscreant could sabotage the convoy or the peace agreement.\n\nMr Chaudhry also thanked local elders for making the peace deal possible.\n\nMeanwhile, six jirga members from the Muqbal, Para Chamkani and Mangal areas, who could not sign the peace agreement earlier, have also signed the document, jirga member Haji Swab Khan Jagi told Dawn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
