The said person continuously remained in touch with him for 10-15 days but he was avoiding him.\n\nSubsequently, he (Hamid) approached his friend Zohaib and later on at night on Dec 24, three people came to his office in Saima Arabian Villas.\n\nTwo of them identified themselves as Muzamil and Hammad.\n\nThe complainant said he told them he would ask his friend to arrange dollars as he did not have the currency.\n\nThey made a video of a dollar whose picture was in his cell phone and sent it to someone else.\n\nAs per the FIR, the suspects asked for 30,000 dollars and when he demanded payment for such a quantity of foreign currency, the said suspects did not give him any positive response and stayed there for 45 minutes.\n\nThey told him that a person namely Ashar would come and make the payment to him. In the meantime, they all went to a restaurant in the area where at around 1am on Dec 25, three people in a Suzuki Alto vehicle also arrived, who identified themselves as Ashar, Muzamil and Zaman.\n\nThe complainant said when he asked Ashar for the payment, he also avoided and went for a while where he made a phone call to someone.\n\nSubsequently, at 1:40am one police mobile, without number plate, arrived in which there were five people in plain clothes. The men covered his mouth with a cloth, took him and brought him near the FIA Saddar office.\n\n“The policemen in plain clothes” forcibly opened his Binance account and transferred 340,000 dollars to different accounts. They also took away cash from his pocket.“\n\nThey reset his cell phone, handed it back to him and dropped him near the mausoleum of Quaid-i-Azam Mohammed Ali Jinnah at 4am. He hired a rickshaw and reached his home.\n\nIG defends CTD\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon said that it was an act of individuals not of the CTD.\n\nHe said police always took action whenever a policeman was found involved in any illegal act. “We do not spare anyone,” declared Mr Memon. He said that no leniency was being given to any policeman found involved in the illegal act.\n\nNot only FIRs were registered against them, but they would also face departmental action and dismissal from the service.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
