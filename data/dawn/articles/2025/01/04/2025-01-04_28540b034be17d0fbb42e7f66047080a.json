This was an unnecessary enmity stoked by the government,” he added.\n\nMr Abbas also criticised the ruling elite for their lack of engagement with the public, pointing out how key leaders such as Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Ishaq Dar had failed to visit conflict zones, such as the Kurram district.\n\n‘Betrayal’ of elder brother\n\nTurning his attention to the current political leadership, Mr Achakzai criticised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for his role in what he called a “fake government”.\n\nHe accused PM Shehbaz of working in tandem with establishment to undermine democratic processes.\n\n“Shehbaz Sharif was ready to become prime minister under Musharraf, and now that Nawaz Sharif has backed off, Shehbaz has joined the establishment,” the PkMAP leader remarked.\n\nThe accusation prompted a sharp rebuke from the PML-N, with Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb saying that “such baseless remarks” did not behove a politician of Mr Achakzai’s stature.\n\nShe said that the PkMAP chief was himself a witness to the fact that Shehbaz Sharif had consistently refused to betray his elder brother. History bears witness to the fact that PM Shehbaz rejected the offer of the prime ministership three times, choosing loyalty to his brother over personal ambition.\n\nSiddiqui meets Fazl\n\nSeparately, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui — who is also the spokesperson for the government team holding talks with the PTI — called on JUI-F leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Friday to discuss the status of the ongoing negotiations.\n\nDuring their meeting, Senator Siddiqui lauded the Mr Rehman’s efforts in resolving the madressah registration issue amicably.\n\nThe JUI-F chief said that negotiations between political parties were an important part of the democratic process.\n\n“All major issues can be resolved only through sitting together and talking to each other, and refusing to negotiate tantamount to undemocratic behaviour,” the Mr Rehman said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
