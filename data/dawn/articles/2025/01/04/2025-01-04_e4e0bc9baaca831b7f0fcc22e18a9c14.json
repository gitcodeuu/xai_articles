But the contact broke down following PTI founder Imran Khan’s arrest in a new case following bail in antoher.\n\nMr Khan was granted bail in the Toshakhana case — concerning the purchase of an expensive Bulgari jewellery set at a throwaway price — but was not released as Rawalpindi police arrested him on terrorism charges related to a September 2024 protest.\n\n“Now, the PTI is not holding backdoor talks with the establishment,” Mr Gohar stated, adding that doors for talks with the military in future “haven’t been shut”.\n\nMr Gohar also dismissed claims of an offer by authorities to move the PTI founder from Adiala Jail to his residence in Banigala.\n\nThe PTI founder considers his incarceration illgal so there is no point in considering such an offer, Mr Gohar stated.\n\nTrilateral meeting\n\nThe PTI chairman also ruled out the possibility of talks between Mr Khan, PML-N president Nawaz Sharif and PPP’s Asif Ali Zardari due to “irreconcilable differences”.\n\nHe was replying to a suggestion by PML-N leader Rana Sana­ullah that the three political bigwigs should sit together to overcome the crises facing Pakistan today.\n\nThe PTI chairman called Mr Sana­ullah’s suggestion “idealistic” and said the three leaders had “long-held differences”.\n\n“I might see this day [talks between the three leaders] in my life, but for now, this isn’t possible,” Mr Gohar added.\n\nTalks with govt to continue\n\nIn Peshawar, PTI’s central information secretary, Sheikh Waqqas Akram, said the ongoing talks with the government “would not be derailed” following the judgement in the £190 million case expected on January 6.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, he said the PTI had not linked the talks with the verdict.\n\nThe talks would continue keeping in view the “government’s seriousness”.\n\nRegarding the remission of sentences handed to 19 PTI workers by military courts, he said their release from prisons cannot be linked with the talks.\n\n“Our workers were released because they were innocent, and it was not possible to further keep them in jail,” he claimed.\n\nCivil disobedience\n\nHe said the first phase of PTI’s civil disobedience movement — in which the party called upon overseas Pakistanis not to send remittances — had been underway for 15 to 20 days. “This will give a big blow to the already weak government.”\n\nHe said the impact of this action would become visible after two months, and the party would closely monitor it.\n\nAccording to Mr Akram, PTI would withdraw the call for civil disobedience movement decision if the government released all its imprisoned workers and leaders and formed a judicial commission to probe the May 9 and November 26 protests.\n\nThe civil disobedience movement was “necessary” for a country where the Constitution, laws and human rights were violated and lawmakers were abducted.\n\nWhile commenting on the internet disruption, Mr Akram said it would be detrimental to the digital economy and the youth, who were boosting the economy by earning millions of dollars.\n\nMohammad Ashfaq in Peshawar also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
