He said there was a subsequent exchange of fire that left five dead and six injured.\n\n“As per our information, they had a past conflict and there was personal enmity between the parties over property and previous murders,” the SP said, adding that the police were determining how many people were targeted from each side.\n\nHe added that no arrests were made so far.\n\nLast month, five people, including three of a family and two passers-by, were killed when they came under fire near Academy Town.\n\nThe local police claimed to have arrested one of the suspects, identified as Saboor, whereas other attackers escaped the scene.\n\nThe alleged attackers and victims were stated to be close relatives and they had a blood feud.\n\nAn official at the Pishtakhara police station said several members of a family were travelling in a vehicle when they were attacked by their rivals.",
