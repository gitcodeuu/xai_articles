  "content": "PARIS: World food commodity prices declined by 2.1 per cent in 2024 compared to the previous year, mainly due to falls in cereals and sugar, the FAO said on Friday.\n\nLast year, the UN Food and Agriculture Organ­isation’s price index for cereals dropped 13.3 compared to 2023 and its sugar price index fell 13.2 percent.\n\nThe decreases were offset in part by a 9.4-per cent rise in the vegetable oil price index.\n\nThe United Nations’ food agency tracks monthly and global changes in the international prices of a set of globally traded commodities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
