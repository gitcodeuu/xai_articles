  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday allowed a woman who married of her own choice to go with her husband, but ordered the bridegroom to enhance the dower amount (haq mehr) from $1,000 to $10,000.\n\nJustice Farooq Haider heard a habeas corpus petition filed by the woman’s father, seeking her recovery from the alleged illegal custody of her supposed husband. Following a notice, local police brought the couple before the court.\n\nIn response to the court’s inquiry, the woman stated that she was an adult and had married of her own free will.\n\nDenying the charges of being abducted or threatened, she told the court that she wanted to go with her husband and not with her father.\n\nThe judge then asked her husband about his monthly income, to which he replied that he worked in the United States and earned $2,000 per month.\n\nAt this point, Justice Haider remarked that $1,000 in haq mehr was insufficient and observed that the amount should be increased to ensure the woman’s security.\n\nOn the court’s order, the groom submitted an affidavit setting the dower amount at $10,000. In light of the woman’s statement, the judge also disposed of the habeas corpus petition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
