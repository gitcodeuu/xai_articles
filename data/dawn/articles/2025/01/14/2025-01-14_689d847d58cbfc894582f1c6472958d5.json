He assured that Azerbaijani authorities would provide maximum facilitation to Pakistani traders exploring opportunities in Azerbaijan. Referring to the positive impact of direct flights between the two countries, the ambassador revealed that bilateral trade volume has tripled since 2022, growing from $10 million to significantly higher levels. He said that over 80,000 Pakistanis visited Azerbaijan last year which reflected the growing interest and people-to-people connections.\n\nThe ambassador also invited Pakistani investors to explore opportunities in Azerbaijan’s infrastructure and energy sectors and highlighted the country’s strategic position as a key international transport corridor between Asia and Europe.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2025",
