  "content": "JEDDAH: Barcelona came from an early goal down to beat Real Madrid 5-2 in the Spanish Super Cup final on Sunday, scoring four goals in a dominant first half and surviving having their goalkeeper sent off to clinch a record-extending 15th trophy.\n\nLamine Yamal, Robert Lewandowski, Raphinha and Alejandro Balde were all on target before halftime, after French forward Kylian Mbappe put Real in front in the fifth minute. Raphinha grabbed another in the second half while Rodrygo scored for Real.\n\nBarcelona put in a clinical display to lift their first trophy in more than a year, having no silverware to show for last season.\n\n“A goal for big clubs is always to win titles, that’s why we work hard. But now we have to show it in the next games,” Hansi Flick told a press conference after winning his first trophy as Barca coach.\n\n“Real made many mistakes, and we knew how to take advantage of them to control the match.”\n\nBarca prevented Real from winning their third title of the campaign, after they won the European Super Cup against Atalanta and beat Mexico’s Pachuca to the Intercontinental Cup last month.\n\n“In the first half we didn’t play football, we hit long balls and that wasn’t the idea,” Real coach Carlo Ancelotti said.\n\n“I told the players that they can lose games, but not in the way we played in the first half.\n\nWe defended badly and that cost us the game — they found their goals quite easily. We’re sad, like all our fans, it’s disappointing and we don’t have to hide that... we have to look forwards, there’s nothing else we can do.”\n\nMbappe earned an early advantage for the Spanish champions, finishing a solo run from around the halfway line with a shot inside the far post.\n\nBut what looked like a dream start quickly turned into a nightmare for Ancelotti’s men when Yamal levelled for Barca in the 22nd minute. Striker Lewandowski gave them the lead 14 minutes later from a penalty awarded for Eduardo Camavinga’s foul on Gavi.\n\nRaphinha increased the advantage with a stunning header from a brilliant long cross by Jules Kounde in the 39th minute, and left back Balde added a fourth for Barca deep into stoppage time after nine minutes were added to the first half.\n\nYamal released Raphinha with a precise pass following Real’s miserable corner kick, before the Brazil forward left the ball to Balde who scored with a simple finish.\n\nReal started the second half with Rodrygo hitting the bar, sparking hopes of the hectic clash taking another turn.\n\nBut Raphinha quelled any sniff of a comeback when he made it 5-1 three minutes after the break, having slalomed past the Real defence.\n\nBarca were left with 10 men when goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny was sent off for fouling Mbappe in the 56th minute and Rodrygo beat substitute keeper Inaki Pena from the resulting free kick.\n\nBut Real, who hold a five-point advantage over Barca in La Liga after 19 games, had no shots on goal after the penalty until Mbappe’s effort was denied by Pena in stoppage time.\n\n“He was the best (Madrid player),” said Ancelotti, noting an improvement after Mbappe’s hit-and-miss start to life at the club following his switch from Paris St-Germain.\n\n“We can’t always win, if we have to lose a cup, it’s better that it’s this one,” said veteran Real midfielder Luka Modric.\n\nBarcelona also lost defender Inigo Martinez before the half-hour mark through injury, with Ronald Araujo stepping in.\n\nBarcelona and Real met in the competition’s final for third consecutive time, with Ancelotti’s side prevailing last year while Barca lifted the trophy in 2023.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2025",
