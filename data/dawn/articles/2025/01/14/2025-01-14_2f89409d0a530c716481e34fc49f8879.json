A more focused approach, based on demonstrable need, would be preferable to the current generic proposal,” he said.\n\nThe governor pointed out that in order to ensure compliance with Constitutional provisions, the KP Amendment Bill, 2024, was being returned to the provincial assembly for reconsideration.\n\nDuring the session, opposition PPP member Ahmad Karim Kundi said that special advisers had never been elected.\n\n“During PTI government, Hafiz Shaikh was nominated for NFC meetings as an adviser, so people filed a writ petition in the court objecting that Shaikh was not a federal minister to chair the NFC meeting,” he said.\n\nThe lawmaker said the provincial government didn’t have a finance minister and if an unelected person was sent to a committee’s meeting, the federal government would stop him from attending it.\n\nHe added that people would go to the court as the ministers were replaced with advisers and special assistance in the Act.\n\n“It will be much more effective and appropriate to reconsider the apprehensions and concerns of the governor KP,” he said.\n\nMember of the opposition JUI-F Adnan Khan said that he had proposed amendments but they were not considered.\n\n“Advisers and special assistance are not part of the cabinet,” he said, wondering how an unelected person could be held accountable.\n\nMPA Hussain Laghmani said that the committees were part of the house and unelected persons attending the meeting, was contrary to the definition of democracy and supported the opposition benches that unelected people should not be part of the cabinet or proceedings of the house calling it against the Constitution.\n\nJUI-F member Maulana Lutfur Rehman said that the 26 Constitutional Amendment was passed after consultation with the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf.\n\nIn response, law minister Aftab Alam Afridi told the house that the main objective of the amendment bill was to provide legal cover to the advisers and special assistance as they held several departments and chaired meetings.\n\nHe said that there were 34 departments and the advisers and special assistance helped the chief minister adding that the advisors were covered under the Constitution, while the special assistants were covered under Rule 33(A) of Rules of Business.\n\n“I suggest the formation of a special select committee for discussing the bill before the next session and the seekingof the advocate general’s opinion to satisfy us. The entire house could be taken on board,” he said.\n\nMr Afridi said according to Article 16 of the Constitution, any matter for reconsideration could be returned with or without amendment by the provincial assembly.\n\n“As far as the 26th Constitutional Amendment is concerned, an advocate general could speak on the floor of the house that covered advisers and special assistance,” he said.\n\nThe minister said under Article 131 (11), five advisers could become part of the cabinet and there was no mention of elected or unelected persons.\n\nFormer speaker of the assembly Mushtaq Ahmad Ghani also supported the opposition’s objections to the bill and asked the law minister if he would sit in a meeting chaired by unelected persons.\n\nHe said the bill should be sent to the select committee for a detailed discussion.\n\nThe house also unanimously passed a resolution, which demanded of the provincial government to recommend to the federal government to fulfil the promises made regarding the development of merged tribal districts. It also called for the provision of funds promised by the federal government and other provinces.\n\nThe resolution, moved by MPA Ajmal Khan, read that the new National Finance Commission Award be announced and the payments regarding the war on terrorism be made.\n\nIt also said that the federal and provincial governments should provide three of the federal divisible pool funding to the provincial government for development of the merged tribal districts, bringing them on par with developed areas.\n\nMinister Afridi, however, said that the federal government would never announce a new NFC Award as it increased KP’s share in national funds from 14 per cent to 19 per cent.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2025",
