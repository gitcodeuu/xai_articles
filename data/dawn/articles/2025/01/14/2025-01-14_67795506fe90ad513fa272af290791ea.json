He directed the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunication and FBR to work together to further improve the faceless customs assessment system.\n\nCalls for collaboration with private sector to boost investment in housing projects\n\nHe desired that the system should be shifted to artificial intelligence by minimising the human intervention.\n\nHe ordered the development of a comprehensive strategy for the implementation of the track and trace system in various industrial sectors.\n\nThe meeting was briefed on the recent FBR reforms. The faceless customs system at all Karachi port terminals would be made fully operational by the end of February this year, it was told.

The meeting was told that upgrade of the web-based One Customs began and its design was expected to be completed by the end of March.\n\nLow-cost housing schemes\n\nChairing another meeting, PM Shehbaz ordered the completion of ongoing federal government’s low-cost housing projects expeditiously, besides asking for collaboration with the private sector to boost investment in the housing projects. He also instructed ensuring a third-party validation of the projects.\n\nThe Ministry of Housing informed the prime minister about the progress on the ongoing reforms and policy measures in its various departments. It was informed that consultations with all the stakeholders for amendments to the National Housing Policy 2001 had been completed and the process for its final approval would be completed by March.\n\nThe meeting was also apprised of the ongoing and future projects under the Pakistan Housing Authority.
