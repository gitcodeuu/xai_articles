  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Justice Musarrat Hilali, a member of the Constitutional Bench hearing the case of military trial of civilians, has wondered whether the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) 1952 outlined any punishment for officers who suspend the Constitution.\n\nJustice Hilali was part of the seven-judge bench hearing intra-court appeals (ICAs) against the Supreme Court’s October 2023 order of nullifying the military trial of civilians involved in the May 9 violence.\n\nShe also posed questions about Article 6 of the Constitution, which deals with high treason.\n\nIf the provision was applicable to every citizen, then how are certain fundamental rights, also enshrined in the Constitution, not applicable to the accused facing trials under the PAA, observed Justice Hilali.\n\nJudges question whether evidence presented before military courts fulfils Qanoon-i-Shahadat requirements\n\nIn response to the queries, Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the Defence Ministry, contended that Article 6 prevails over all laws.\n\nOn this, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail wondered what punishment was outlined in Article 6 for aiding constitutional violations.\n\nHe remarked that even the judiciary has endorsed or validated the abrogation or suspension of the Constitution in the past.\n\nJustice Muhammad Ali Mazhar recalled how during the treason trial of Gen Pervez Musharraf, the names of certain judges were taken, but they were never tried.\n\nLegality of military trials\n\nWhen Mr Haris laid out the PAA provisions that outline the process to set up courts for trying civilians, Justice Mandokhail remarked that there was no dispute over these courts.\n\nThe only point of concern was the extent to which the act could include civilians in its domain, he observed.\n\nThe counsel highlighted past Supreme Court decisions that empower the higher judiciary to review military court verdicts if legal requirements were not met.\n\nAnother bench member, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, remarked that without examining the military court’s judgments, how will the court know whether the requirements of Qanoon-i-Shahadat act have been adhered to or violated?\n\nHe also asked if the court could see the record of these cases.\n\n“We want to see what was the standard of evidence recorded in the military trial, was the cross-examination of the witnesses was conducted, was the right to present defence witnesses were allowed, whether the right to be represented through a counsel of choice was given and whether the witness recorded was reflected in the judgment by the military court or not,” asked Justice Rizvi.\n\nThe counsel agreed to put case records before the court and the procedure followed in the trial without revealing the convict’s identity.\n\nThe apex court should not ad-dress the merits of the cases and the trials should not be affected by the proceedings of this case, the counsel said.\n\nJustice Aminud Din Khan, who is heading the bench, asked the counsel to keep the record safe.\n\nThe court will ask for it if need be since there will be appeals against the trials.\n\nJustice Mazhar said it was necessary to see the record to ascertain whether a fair trial was ensured and requirements of the Criminal Procedure Code were fulfilled.\n\nHe added that it was also necessary to determine whether a joint trial of all accused took place to ensure that the prohibition of double jeopardy in the trial was ensured.\n\nThe prohibition of double jeopardy is a legal principle that prevents an accused from being tried or charged again for the same crime if they have already been tried and found not guilty.\n\nThe counsel, Mr Haris, stated that the trials were conducted separately and argued that the Supreme Court “cannot see” the quality of evidence in military trials.\n\nThe counsel said before reviewing the quality of evidence, the Supreme Court has to consider the jurisdiction of the present appeals.\n\nJustice Rizvi said the court will not discuss the cases but can examine the record.\n\nWhen Justice Mandokhail observed that he was confused as to how an ordinary citizen was connected to the discipline of the armed forces, the counsel replied that if the citizen was accused of seducing an army officer, the provision of law dealing with maintaining discipline in the armed forces apply to them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2025",
