  "content": "GWADAR: While traffic between Gwadar and Karachi was suspended for at least 24 hours due to a gas leak from a tanker carrying liquid petroleum gas, the Quetta-Karachi highway remained blocked due to protests against the recent arrests in Zehri area.\n\nThe coastal highway was closed by authorities as a precautionary measure to avoid any untoward incident, as there was a gas leak from the tanker heading from Iran to Karachi.\n\nMeanwhile, the Quetta-Karachi highway was blocked at Anjira cross and Surab area by protesters demonstrating against arrests made in the Zehri area.\n\nThe blockade, which lasted over 40 hours, caused significant disruptions to traffic, stranding hundreds of vehicles, including passenger coaches and trucks.\n\nThe local administration successfully negotiated with the protesters, and the highway was reopened late in the evening, restoring traffic flow.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 14th, 2025",
