Ali and Sheikh Liaquat Hussain, could be used as precedent for military trial of civilians.\n\n“We are not demanding the release of those responsible for the May 9 attacks,” he clarified.\n\n“Our argument is simply that they should be tried in civilian courts to uphold the rule of law.” The counsel also emphasised that a remedy in the shape of a writ petition before the high court was not a right of the accused, rather at the discretion of the court.\n\nHe said the fundamental right were well entrenched in the Constitution and could not be taken away. “But here in the present case, the minute a civilian was accused of the offence under sections 2(1d)(i) and (ii), the fundamental rights go away, and the mere accusation was enough to snatch these rights,” he contended.\n\nHe further argued that while members of the armed forces voluntarily give up certain rights under Article 8(3) of the Constitution, civilians do not, making the ouster clause inapplicable to them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025",
