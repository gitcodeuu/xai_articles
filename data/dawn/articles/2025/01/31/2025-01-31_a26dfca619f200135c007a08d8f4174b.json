The committee that was formed in 2018 should also complete its probe, and a House committee should be formed to investigate the February 2024 elections to bring the facts to the forefront,” the PM said.\n\nRegarding the Nov 26 protest, he said the committee should probe that as well as a months-long sit-in staged by the PTI in Islamabad in 2014, when it was in the opposition.\n\n“It takes two to tango. This dialogue should move forward so that the country can progress, instead of bearing more harm due to their violent protests,” he added.\n\nRecalling the negotiation process, the premier said: “We genuinely accepted their offer, constituted a committee, and initiated dialogue with the help of the [National Assembly] speaker.\n\n“The committee asked the PTI to present their demands in writing and the government also agreed to present a response in writing.” A meeting was supposed to be convened on the 28th of this month, but the PTI refused the talks, he added.\n\n“Our members told them that the (government) is ready to present a response in writing and invited them to come to the table again,” the premier said.\n\nHe referred to the parliamentary committee formed in 2018 under the former government to finalise the terms of reference (To Rs) to investigate the election rigging allegations.\n\n“After the 2018 elections, when we (as the opposition) entered the parliament while wearing black bands in protest, Imran Niazi (who was the prime minister at that time) told me that his government was forming a committee and a thorough probe would be carried out,” he added.\n\nRecalling that Imran then announced the formation of the committee, PM Shehbaz highlighted: “In 2018, they (the PTI) made a house committee, not a judicial commission.\n\nThey offered the formation of a house committee and we accepted it, but the committee only held one or two meetings.“\n\nCabinet decisions\n\nThe federal cabinet approved several important decisions across multiple sectors, including climate, aviation, energy and legal affairs.\n\nIt ratified the country’s participation in the Middle East Green Initiative, which aims to restore 200 million hectares of land and plant 50 billion trees across participating countries.\n\nDuring the meeting, the officials of the Ministry of Climate Change informed the forum that Pakistan was among the founding members of the charter, and therefore, the ministry had recommended the forum to accord its approval.\n\nThe cabinet also approved the Off-the-Grid Captive Power Plants Levy Ordinance 2025 on the recommendation of the petroleum division.\n\nThe forum was briefed on the statement made in parliament in 2020 regarding the pilots of Pakistan International Airlines.\n\nThe meeting was informed that the statement made by former federal minister Sarwar Khan regarding PIA pilots was irresponsible and exaggerated.\n\nIt not only severely affected the country’s and airline’s image but also caused serious damage to the exchequer.\n\nThe cabinet approved the formation of a fact-finding committee to review that statement, investigate the motives behind it and estimate the loss caused to the national airline.\n\nThe federal cabinet approved the agreement between the government of Pakistan and the European Union on the recommendation of the Ministry of Commerce regarding the distribution of tariff rates quota.\n\nIt approved the reorganisation of Accountability Court-III in Islamabad and its conversion into a Special Court (CNS-III) on the recommendation of the Islamabad High Court and the proposal of the Ministry of Law and Justice.\n\nThe meeting approved the additional charge of the Karachi Port Trust chairman, Rear Admiral Habibur Rehman, for a maximum of two months.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz directed officials to complete the process of appointing a regular chairman immediately.\n\nThe cabinet reduced the provincial quota in federally managed medical and dental colleges by 25 per cent.\n\nThe cabinet, on the recommendation of the Rightsizing Committee of the federal government, has approved an amendment to the Rules of Business, 1973, regarding the merger of the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan and the Ministry of Frontier Affairs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025",
