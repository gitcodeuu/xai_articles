I should be addressed as the senior puisne judge; otherwise, the system will be upset,” stated Justice Shah, who was the chief guest at the ceremony.\n\nReferring to Chief Justice Yahya Afridi, the senior puisne judge said, “He is our chief justice of Pakistan,” adding that “we need to look forward and things will improve soon”.\n\nJustice Shah, who administered the oath to the 17-member body, stressed the importance of oath, stating that it is not just a collection of words, but holds deeper meaning.\n\nHe said the oath serves as a compass, guiding and protecting in difficult situations. If the oath is followed, no problems will arise, but when it is broken, the structure of the system will collapse, he added.\n\nCiting a quote from the play A Man for All Seasons, Justice Shah mentioned: “When a man takes an oath, he is holding his own self in his own hands, like water. And, if he opens his fingers then, he needn’t hope to find himself again.”\n\nKBA president Aamir Nawaz Warraich, while referring to the All Pakistan Lawyers’ Convention held in October, said initially people did not grasp the gravity of the 26th Amendment.\n\nHowever, after amendments made in the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), people — especially media persons — are beginning to realise the true purpose of the 26th Amendment, he added.\n\nMr Warraich alleged that through the amendment, the judiciary has been brought under control by“ appointing hand-picked judges“, which, he claimed, led to the “collapse of the judicial system”.\n\nHe questioned the legal avenues available to those seeking to challenge the amendments, stating that they felt hopeless about where to file their petitions.\n\nHe said that any petition challenging the Peca Amendment Act would ultimately be dismissed.\n\nMr Warraich also claimed that a bill against the legal community is set to be tabled in parliament, adding that it would prevent lawyers from protesting, else their licences would be cancelled.\n\nThe KBA’s annual elections were held in December.\n\nThose who took oath on Thursday are KBA president Warraich, vice president Kazim Hussain Mahesar, general secretary Korai, joint secretary Imran Aziz, treasurer Haseebullah Panhwar, librarian Riaz Ahmed and 11 members of its managing committee.\n\nDistrict judges, Sindh High Court Bar Association president Mohammad Sarfaraz Ali Metlo, senior counsel, and a large number of legal fraternity members attended the event.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025",
