  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The journalist community will take to the streets today to protest controversial amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), which were rushed through both houses of parliament and signed into law by President Asif Ali Zardari this week.\n\nThe protest, announced by the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), will have representation of all major media bodies, including the All Pakistan Newspapers Society, the Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors, the Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors, and the Pakistan Broadcasters Association.\n\nOn the PFUJ’s call, black flags will be hoisted at press clubs and union offices across the country and rallies will be organised. Journalists will cover official and non-official events on Friday by wearing black armbands, according to the PFUJ.\n\nIn a statement issued by the Joint Action Committee (JAC) representing the PBA, AEMEND, CPNE, PFUJ, and APNS, the committee said it completely rejected this amendment and a vigorous public and legal struggle would be waged against it.\n\nMedia, rights bodies vow to resist law through public, legal measures\n\n“Contacts have been initiated with civil society, human rights organisations, lawyers’ organisations and other stakeholders. Con­sultations with legal experts are being finalised to challenge the Peca Act Amendment Bill in court,” the statement said, adding, “All journalist organisations included in the Joint Action Committee will participate fully in the nationwide protest of PFUJ.”\n\n‘Broad coalition’\n\nAccording to PFUJ President Afzal Butt, a nationwide campaign will be launched to mobilise journalists, lawyers, human rights activists, and civil society. The statement also said that a call for a sit-in would be given in front of the Parliament House.\n\nIn Islamabad, a broad coalition of journalists, lawyers, and civil society organisations was formed to resist the new law that imposed curbs on freedom of expression. The coalition was announced following a co­­nsultation organised by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP), where the speakers criticised the political parties that had previously opposed Peca but swiftly endorsed the latest amendments to it.\n\nDuring the discussion, participants warn­­ed that the amendment’s vague definitions of ‘fake news’ could be weaponised to suppress dissent, emphasising that the ability for any individual to file complaints regardless of whether they were directly affected opened the door to its widespread misuse.\n\nWhile acknowledging the challenges posed by misinformation, speakers stressed the need for a balanced approach that did not undermine the constitutional right to free speech. The consultation culminated in the formation of a grand coalition, uniting organisations such as the PFUJ, the HRCP, the Supreme Court Bar Association, the Digital Media Alliance of Pakistan, Freedom Network, Irada, Wajah, Bolo Bhi, and the Anchors Association of Pakistan.\n\nMeanwhile in Karachi, journalist bodies, senior editors, members of the legal fraternity and political leaders condemned the recently passed amendments and unanimously agreed to “reject this draconian measure”.\n\nAt a discussion organised by the Karachi Press Club, senior politician and former Senate chairman Mian Raza Rabbani stated that the recently passed law reflects the rapidly diminishing space for democratic norms and debate in the country.\n\nFormer Sindh High Court Bar Association president Barri­ster Salahuddin Ahmed stated that following the 26th Constitutional Amendment, there was little hope for any relief from the judiciary regarding the recently passed law.\n\n“The only way forward is to plan a united struggle to push back against this law,” he said.\n\nImran Ayub in Karachi also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025",
