In contrast, the FO had avoided direct comment on the controversy surrounding NFSC’s sponsorship of the event.\n\nPakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which was termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.",
