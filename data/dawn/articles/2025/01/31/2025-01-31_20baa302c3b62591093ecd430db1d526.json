PAT25, pass behind the CRJ,” an air traffic controller says at 0147 GMT on Wednesday, according to a recording on liveatc.net.\n\nSeconds later, another aircraft calls in to air traffic control, saying, “Tower, did you see that?” — apparently referring to the crash.\n\nAn air traffic controller then redirects planes heading to runway 33 to go around.\n\nAccording to Flightradar24’s Ian Petchenik, the collision occurred at approximately 300 feet (90 meters), mere seconds before landing.\n\n“The runway threshold is at the river’s edge.\n\nThe Kansas flight was ready to touch down,“ he told WUSA-TV in DC.\n\nCommercial aircraft like the one involved are equipped with TCAS (Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System), designed to alert pilots to nearby aircraft and provide last-minute collision avoidance instructions.\n\nThe helicopter was from the 12th Aviation Battalion, which is based at Fort Belvoir in Virginia.\n\nThe unit is responsible for helicopter flights in the US capital area and can be used to carry senior government officials.\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth told reporters at the White House that there appears to have been an elevation issue with the Black Hawk, and said Army investigators were on the ground looking into the matter.\n\n“It was a fairly experienced crew and it was doing a required annual night evaluation,” Hegseth said in an earlier statement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 31st, 2025",
