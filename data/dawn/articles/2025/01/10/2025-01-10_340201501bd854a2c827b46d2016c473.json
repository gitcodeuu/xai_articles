The fire quickly spread towards the olive and pine forests in the area.\n\nRescue spokesperson Aizaz Mahmood stated that the fire broke out at four different locations, including the village of Tajori on the northern side and Al-Mar-Kalan village on the southern side.\n\nThe blaze is causing damage to valuable trees, such as olive, pine nut, nettle, and gur-gure, and is also harming local wildlife and bird species.\n\nThe flames can be seen from the tehsil headquarters in Darra Zinda.\n\nLocals report that the fire began two days ago, but in the past few hours, it has spread over several kilometres area and is clearly visible from the ground, especially during the night.\n\nAccording to sources in the forest department, forest fires occur every year and are often started by locals by burning dry grass. Strong winds cause the fire to spread, leading to significant damage to valuable forest areas.\n\nRescue 1122 spokesperson confirmed that the fire had been brought under control through a joint operation involving Rescue 1122 and the wildlife department.\n\nIn response to the emergency, techniques such as smothering and starvation were employed to extinguish the fire, which proved effective in the high mountainous regions, where fire trucks could not reach.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2025",
