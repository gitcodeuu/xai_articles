Malala was evacuated from the country after receiving initial treatment. The Nobel laureate has returned to the country only a handful of times since.\n\n“I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls’ education,” Malala said today in a post on X.\n\n“On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls.”\n\nA spokesperson for her Malala Fund charity confirmed she will attend the summit in person, which is scheduled to take place on January 11 and 12 and will focus on girls’ education in Muslim communities.\n\nAfghanistan is the only country in the world where girls and women are banned from going to school and university. Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban government has imposed an austere version of Islamic law which the United Nations has called “gender apartheid”.\n\nGirls are only allowed to attend primary school, while women are largely restricted to working in segregated environments in health or education. The Taliban administration claims that Islamic law “guarantees” the rights of Afghan men and women.\n\nThe summit will be inaugurated by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and bring together ministers and ambassadors from 44 countries as well as representatives from the United Nations and the World Bank.\n\nThe summit will confirm “the shared commitment of (the) Muslim community to empower girls through education”, according to a government statement.\n\nFederal Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui on Thursday said that the two-day international conference would address challenges to women’s access to education across the Muslim world.\n\nIn 2018, Malala visited her hometown in Swat, more than five years after the attack. The same year, she visited again, travelling to areas devastated by unprecedented monsoon flooding and met flood victims.",
