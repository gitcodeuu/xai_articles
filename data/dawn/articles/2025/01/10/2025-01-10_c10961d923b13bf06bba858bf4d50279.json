Regulating such content is not censorship,” Volker Turk said on X.\n\nAFP currently works in 26 languages with Facebook’s fact-checking scheme. In that programme, content rated “false” is downgraded in news feeds so fewer people will see it and if someone tries to share that post, they are presented with an article explaining why it is misleading.\n\nSupinya Klangnarong, co-founder of Thai fact-checking platform Cofact, said Meta’s decision could have concrete effects offline. “Understandably this policy from Meta is aimed at US users, but we cannot be certain how it will affect other countries,” she told AFP.\n\n“Allowing the proliferation of hate speech and racist dialogue could be a trigger towards violence.”\n\nCofact is not an accredited member of the International Fact-Checking Network or of Facebook’s fact-checking scheme.\n\nMeta’s policy overhaul came less than two weeks before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office and it aligns with the Republican Party’s stance.\n\nTrump has been a harsh critic of Meta and Zuckerberg for years, accusing the company of bias against him and threatening to retaliate against the tech billionaire once back in office.\n\nZuckerberg has been making efforts to reconcile with Trump since his election in November, meeting at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida and donating one million dollars to his inauguration fund.\n\nThe Meta chief also named Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) head Dana White, a close ally of Trump, to the company board.\n\nAngie Drobnic Holan, director of the International Fact-Checking Network, said on Tuesday the decision came after “extreme political pressure”. The move “will hurt social media users who are looking for accurate, reliable information to make decisions about their everyday lives and interactions with friends and family”.\n\nAustralia said Meta’s decision was “a very damaging development”, while Brazil warned it was “bad for democracy”.\n\nMeta’s move into fact-checking came in the wake of Trump’s shock election in 2016, which critics said was enabled by rampant disinformation on Facebook and interference by foreign actors, including Russia, on the platform.",
