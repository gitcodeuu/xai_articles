He urged the public to inform the administration about suspicious activities.\n\nThe incident comes a few days after an attacker rammed an explosive-laden car into a bus transporting FC personnel from Karachi to Turbat in Behan area near its destination on Saturday. The banned Baloch Liberation Army said its Majeed Brigade had carried out the blast.\n\nThe attack left six people dead and over 50 people injured, including Senior Superintendent of Police Zohaib Mohsin and six members of his family.\n\nPakistan, particularly Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, saw a sharp uptick in terrorism-related incidents in 2024.\n\nWith at least 685 members of security forces losing their lives amid a total of 444 terror attacks, 2024 turned out to be the deadliest year for civil and military security forces of Pakistan in a decade.\n\nEqually alarming were the cumulative losses of civilians and security personnel: 1,612 fatalities, accounting for over 63pc of the total recorded this year and marking 73pc more losses compared to 934 outlaws eliminated.",
