All stakeholders have been asked to provide actual data on FY24, revised estimates for FY25 and FY6 budget estimates, and other templates for current development besides revenues, etc.\n\nFinance Ministry sets target for presenting mid-year review in Feb\n\nThe budget call letter 2025-26 is largely unchanged as last year but calls for a new set of information to identify and tag green (climate) components of revenues as required by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other lenders. Instructions relating to gender budgeting have also been updated this year.\n\nUnder the calendar, the MoF plans to seek the cabinet’s approval for the Budget Strategy Paper for 2025-28 by April 18 and then present it to the parliament for proposals and discussions. The MoF would issue indicative budget ceilings for the current and development budget by April 21. The meeting of the Annual Planning Coordination Committee (APCC) will be called in the first week of May to recommend the Public Sector Development Programme to the National Economic Council (NEC) for approval in the second week of May.\n\nThe notification required all the stakeholders to ensure the submission of receipts and current and development expenditure estimates to the Budget Wing of the Finance Division before February 6 by the respective Principal Accounting Officers (PAOs). The remaining information should follow the schedule in the budget calendar.\n\nAll these entities must also provide the actual foreign exchange budget for FY24, revised estimates for FY25, and budget estimates for FY26 based on the specific instructions and general guidelines.\n\nReview and approval of budget estimates and additional demands — current and development — by the Demand Review Committee, if needed, the PAO will be invited to make presentations on their budget proposals to the committee (comprising the Finance Division, Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Division, and the Economic Affairs Division).\n\nThe Demand Review Committee would consider and approve additional expenditures, if any, of the ministries and would also discuss past performance, current year’s budgetary allocations and ceilings for the medium-term budgetary years and deliberations will focus on ‘outputs’ (services) to be delivered and policy priorities outlined by the federal government under the respective performance agreement.\n\nThe demand-wise ceilings for the development budget are prepared and issued by the Ministry of Planning and Development, which would then arrange meetings of the APCC and NEC to approve the annual plan envisaging macroeconomic targets and development budgets. The budget presentation to the federal cabinet and the parliament has been targeted not to go beyond the first week of June.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2025",
