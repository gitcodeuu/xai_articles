This principle applies to every country, whether in the East or the West”. “In talks with our European partners, there is an uneasiness regarding recent statements from the US. It is clear: We must stand together,” he wrote in English on X.\n\nBritain’s Foreign Minister David Lammy said on Thursday he believed Trump recognised that Greenland was part of Denmark and that concerns about Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic lay behind the US president-elect’s remarks.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni on Thursday dismissed speculation the United States might use force to take Greenland or the Panama Canal, saying Donald Trump’s comments on the issue were aimed at China.\n\n“I feel like I can rule out that the United States in the coming years will try to forcefully annex territories that interest them,” Meloni told reporters at her annual press conference.\n\nShe said Trump’s remarks were “more of a message to… other big global players”.\n\nMeloni noted the Panama Canal and Greenland “are both territories in which we have witnessed a growing Chinese prominence in recent years”.\n\nGreenland is already covered by US security guarantees via Denmark’s membership of Nato. Although the former colony is now broadly self-governing within the kingdom of Denmark, security and foreign affairs are still handled by Copenhagen.\n\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said this week she could not imagine that the United States would use military intervention in Greenland and said it was up to the people of Greenland to decide what they want.\n\nFrederiksen summoned leaders of Denmark’s political parties to a meeting for a briefing about Trump’s renewed interest. She rebuffed an offer from Trump in 2019 to buy Greenland. On Wednesday, Frederiksen hosted Greenland’s leader Mute Egede for talks in Copenhagen where Egede favours independence for his homeland.\n\nEgede discussed trade and other issues with the outgoing US ambassador in Copenhagen on Wednesday, the embassy said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2025",
