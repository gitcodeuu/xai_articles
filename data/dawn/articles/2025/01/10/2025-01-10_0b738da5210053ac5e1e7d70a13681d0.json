  "content": "QUETTA: After a heavy exchange of fire that ended in the death of three captors, the Levies and their quick-response force on Thursday managed to safely recover a man kidnapped by an armed gang in Qila Saifullah a day earlier.\n\nJumma Rahim and his business partner Masood Khan were intercepted by kidnappers in Gawal Is­­m­ailzai — a locality between Qila Saifullah and Zhob — on Wednesday. Masood Khan was killed upon re­­sistance while Mr Rahim was taken away, said Qila Saifullah Assistant Com­missioner Naveed Alam.\n\nSoon after receiving information, the Levies and their quick-response force immediately started chasing the kidnapper alongside the tribesmen, who also joined the rescue operation. The kidnappers were encircled in a hilly terrain where heavy firing ensued.\n\nDuring the operation when forces tried to arrest them, two of them blew themselves up as they were reportedly wearing explosive-laden jackets while the third abductor was killed in firing.\n\nThe bodies of the kidnappers were shifted to the hospital. Officials said that a search operation was underway to arrest other members of the gang involved in kidnapping for ransom.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 10th, 2025",
