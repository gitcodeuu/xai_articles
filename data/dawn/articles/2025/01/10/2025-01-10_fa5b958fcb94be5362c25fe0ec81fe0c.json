Its liabilities were nearly $3 billion, about five times the total worth of its assets.\n\nIn the same year, amid a national economic crisis, dozens of domestic flights were cancelled when it could not afford fuel for its planes.\n\nPIA came into being in 1955 when the government nationalised a loss-making commercial airline and enjoyed rapid growth until the 1990s.",
