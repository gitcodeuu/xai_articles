Speakers on the occasion also announced that they would not pay property tax to the RCB if their demands were not accepted.\n\nHowever, before the protesters announced to go to the cantonment office in the form of a rally, Additional Executive Officer Haider Shuja met traders’ representatives at a nearby business centre.\n\nAfter the meeting, Sheikh Hafeez and Zafar Qadri announced that their demands, including the opening of Bank Road, would be accepted by the RCB.\n\nThey informed the participants that the protest was being called off.\n\nTraders Association General Secretary Zafar Qadri told Dawn that cantonment officials led by the additional cantonment executive officer had requested the traders for a meeting.\n\nHe said earlier the cantonment officials were not available and after the shutter-down strike they sent the additional cantonment executive officer for talks, adding, “We believe in dialogue for solving problems so we accepted their assurance and ended the protest.”\n\nLast week, traders had tried to meet cantonment officials to convince them not to close Bank Road but the latter refused to meet the traders. Upon this, the traders association decided to observe a shutter-down strike and protest.\n\nHowever, a senior cantonment official said the demand to open Bank Road would not be accepted.\n\n“Parking problems will be resolved. The additional cantonment executive officer met traders’ representatives to end the protest as it had created rush on The Mall and adjoining roads. However, the demand to open Bank Road will not be accepted,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 8th, 2025",
