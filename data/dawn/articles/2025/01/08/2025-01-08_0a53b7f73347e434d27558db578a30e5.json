  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan High Court (BHC) Justice Muhammad Kamran Mulakhail has directed authorities to issue 15-day eviction notices to individuals “illegally occupying” health department buildings and ordered deputy commissioners and senior superintendents of police to assist in implementing the directive and register cases against violators.\n\nJustice Mulakhail issued the orders while hearing constitutional and contempt of court petitions filed by Dr Nabila Anwar and others.\n\nThe additional advocate general and the dean of Post Graduate Medical Institute (PGMI) presented a list of 60 doctors whose payment issues had been approved, confirming that payment bills were being issued.\n\nThe court instructed that all necessary actions to ensure timely payments for PGMI trainees must be completed without delay or hindrance. It also directed authorities to resolve all pending payment matters for doctors by Jan 31.\n\nJustice Mulakhail says no political gatherings should be held within health institutions\n\nJustice Mulakhail also emphasised that no political gatherings or processions should be held within health institutions.\n\nThe court noted that health and education are essential services, prohibiting employees in these sectors from engaging in political activities or trade union participation.\n\nViolators will face termination of contracts and strict legal action. Employees must submit affidavits confirming non-participation in protests or sit-ins, failing which disciplinary measures will be taken.\n\nIn the first phase, show-cause notices will be issued to violators, and their health cards will be suspended until further disciplinary action is taken.\n\nThe court also directed strict legal measures against those violating service orders or regulatory guidelines, including employees in private hospitals or the health sector.\n\nThe court instructed the secretary and director-general (DG) of Health to issue a circular informing employees that personal grievances related to their jobs should be submitted to senior authorities for resolution within 60 days.\n\nDuring the hearing, the court expressed concern over defamatory content allegedly spread by officials associated with health associations under the Grand Health Alliance. The court ordered the Additional Attorney General to forward a copy of the ruling to the FIA Cybercrime Wing in Quetta for investigation and to submit a report.\n\nJustice Mulakhail directed the Balochistan Chief Secretary to convene a meeting with senior health officials to devise a comprehensive strategy for the health sector. Relevant authorities were ordered to report on the implementation of these directives by Feb 2.\n\nThe court clarified that the secretary and DG Health would not be transferred from their positions until judicial orders were fully complied with.\n\nThe next hearing of the case is scheduled for March 6.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 8th, 2025",
