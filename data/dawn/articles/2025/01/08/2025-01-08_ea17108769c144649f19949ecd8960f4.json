  "content": "LONDON: A 14-year-old boy was stabbed to death in broad daylight on a London bus on Tuesday in the latest knife-crime incident in the British capital, police said.\n\nThe victim was killed on one of the city’s familiar double-decker red buses in Woolwich, southeast London, police said in a statement.\n\nParamedics treated the boy for stab wound injuries at the scene, “but he very sadly died shortly after medics arrived,” the statement added. No arrest was immediately reported.\n\nThe incident comes after an 11-year-old girl was seriously injured in a stabbing in the busy Leicester Square area of London last August. A 32-year-old man was later arrested.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer has called knife crime a “national crisis”.\n\nOffice for National Statistics data released in October said that knife crime in England and Wales was up four percent in the 12 months to June compared to the previous year. It was still lower than pre-pandemic levels, however.\n\nThe Labour government, in power since July, has pledged to halve knife crime in the next decade.\n\nA ban on some knives and machetes came into force in September and the government hopes to prohibit ninja swords.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 8th, 2025",
