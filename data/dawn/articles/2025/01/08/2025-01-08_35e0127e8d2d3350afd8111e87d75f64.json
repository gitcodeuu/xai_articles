Onion exports were also made in 2022, while no shipments were made in 2023. However, the volume of exports was low.\n\nIn fruits, he said low volumes of local kinno and apple shipments were also sent in 2024 and were previously shipped in little quantities.\n\nMr Waheed pointed out that kinno, apple, dates, mango, grapes and onion have vast export potential to Bangladesh.\n\n“I have asked the government to lead an official delegation to Bangladesh and hold talks for boosting trade volume in vegetables, fruits, packed food items, fruit juices and spices,” he said, adding that it takes two to three weeks for local shipments to reach Bangladesh.\n\n“I see a bright future of trade between the two countries in the current year if both the governments sit together and identify sectors of improving trade volume beneficial for each other,” Waheed said.\n\nRice Exporters Association of Pakistan chairman Malik Faisal Jahangir said that exports to Bangladesh could earn $200 million in foreign exchange annually.\n\n“Bangladesh accounts for less than 2pc of our total rice exports,” he said, adding that efforts are being made to enhance the share.\n\nHe said some problems have emerged in the procurement of rice by Bangladesh from India. Previously, India provided rice to Bangladesh at competitive prices by road, while Bangladesh imported rice from Thailand.\n\nHe said the Trading Corporation of Pakistan had received around 11 bids for the supply of 50,000 tonnes long grain white rice (Irri 6 rice) to Bangladesh in response to a global tender issued on Dec 31, 2024.\n\n“50,000 tonnes of Irri-6 rice will fetch $24-26m,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 8th, 2025",
