  "content": "LAHORE: The Punjab government has decided to implement a modern system, inspired by Chinese methods, to tackle the issues of air pollution and dust in Lahore.\n\nUnder this plan, a water sprinkler system will be installed at 1,500 construction sites across the city.\n\n“This technology, developed locally, has been under testing for the past three weeks. Following the successful trials, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has approved its practical implementation,” Punjab Senior Minister Maryam Aurangzeb said here on Tuesday.\n\nChief Minister Maryam Nawaz has directed relevant departments, including Communication & Works and LDA, to immediately install the water sprinkler system.\n\nThis system will spray water in a fountain-like manner to prevent dust and debris from spreading at construction sites.\n\n“It has been made mandatory to cover construction sites with green cloth to contain the spread of cement, dust, and dirt. The installation of the water sprinkler system at Gaddafi Stadium has been ordered to be completed by Jan 15,” Ms Aurangzeb said and emphasised that legal action would be taken against those failing to implement the water spraying system after Feb 10.\n\nShe called this initiative a significant step toward combating smog, stating, “The use of water sprinklers and misting systems will accelerate and improve the mission of environmental protection.”\n\nShe said the EPA had been actively fighting air pollution for the past nine months.\n\n“Behavioural changes, public cooperation, and the use of modern machinery are essential for environmental improvement,” she said and added this initiative highlighted the Punjab government’s commitment and seriousness in addressing Lahore’s air pollution crisis.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 8th, 2025",
