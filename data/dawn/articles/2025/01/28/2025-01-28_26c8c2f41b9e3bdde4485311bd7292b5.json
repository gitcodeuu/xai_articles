  "content": "BAHAWALPUR: Anti-terrorism court (ATC) Bahawalpur judge Muhammad Arshad on Monday discharged Seraiki journalist Shakeel Ahmed known as Razish Liaqatpuri from the case registered against him over the language issue and ordered his release.\n\nIn his judgement (a copy available with Dawn), the ATC judge said “for what has been discussed above there is no solid, cogent, reliable, and inspiring evidence against accused to connect him with the commission of offence, therefore accused Shakeel Ahmed alias Razish, son of Ghulam Sarwar, is hereby discharged from this case. He be released forthwith if not required in any other case”.\n\nIt may be recalled that Rahim Yar Khan police had booked on terrorism charges Seraiki journalist and author Razish Liaqatpuri for making objectionable remarks against the government officers on the basis of language on Sunday.\n\nThe family of Razish and the journalist community of Liaqatpur had alleged that he was taken into custody in a raid by police three days back. However, they kept him in illegal detention at an unknown place and did not show his arrest until Saturday night and later a case under ATC and PECA Act was registered.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 28th, 2025",
