However, the gas sale price for the general industry (captive power plants) has been raised from Rs3,000 per mmBtu to Rs3,500 per mmBtu.\n\nGas theft\n\nThe minister highlighted the government’s “success in reducing gas theft” and expressed optimism about further improvements.\n\nResponding to challenges faced by the industrial sector in Karachi, the minister said out of 2,500 industrial units only 18 generated captive power at Rs13 per unit, while the rest purchased electricity from K-Electric at Rs60 per unit. This disparity places the latter group at a considerable disadvantage.\n\nOn overall improvement in the economy, Musadik Malik said a significant reduction in inflation, which dropped from 38pc to 4.1pc as of December, had been reported.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 28th, 2025",
