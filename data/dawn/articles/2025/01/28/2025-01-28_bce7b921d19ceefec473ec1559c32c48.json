  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Journalist bo­­dies have announced nationwi­­de protests today (Tuesday) agai­nst the amendments to the Preve­n­­tion of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).\n\nThe decision to protest was made on Monday after the Senate Standing Committee on Interior hastily passed the amendments.\n\nThe Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) as issued a statement denouncing the amendments, which were “against the spirit of the Constitution”.\n\nThe PFUJ appealed to all journalist unions to organise protests at their respective press clubs at 3pm today.\n\nVow to challenge amendments in court\n\nLater, PFUJ President Afzal Butt held a news conference at the National Press Club, Islamabad, and deplored the approval granted by parliamentarians.\n\nHe claimed that Information Minister Attaullah Tarar had agreed to consult journalists over the bill. Since the chairman of the Senate’s Interior Committee was from PTI, “we hoped that he might listen to our concerns, but that too did not happen”.\n\nThe committee passed the bill in 15 minutes, which itself expl­ains that “something is wrong”.\n\nMr Butt requested President Zardari not to sign the bill into law if it was approved by the Senate.\n\n“The president must take into account our objections regarding freedom of expression,” Mr Butt said.\n\nMr Butt criticised Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, a former media professional, saying the bill was his brainchild. He said the PFUJ would hold a sit-in outside the Parliament House till this black law is taken back.\n\nMeanwhile, the Joint Action Co­­mmittee (JAC), comprising re­­presentatives of multiple journalist bodies, has also announced its participation in PFUJ’s protest.\n\nThe JAC includes officials of PFUJ, All Pakistan Newspapers Society, Council of Pakistan Newspaper Editors, Association of Electronic Media Editors and News Directors and the Pakistan Broadcasters Association.\n\nThe statement by JAC said that despite repeated requests for consultation by journalists, the bill was passed in a hurry in the National Assembly and then the Senate Standing Committee without listening to stakeholders.\n\nThis was a “clear proof of the government’s intentions and malice”.\n\nThe JAC categorically rejected the amendments and vowed a vigorous public and legal struggle against them.\n\nIt said civil society, human rig­hts organisations, advocacy gro­ups and other stakeholders were being consulted on this law.\n\nThe JAC expressed its intention to challenge the law in court.\n\nThe statement added that all journalist organisations included in the JAC will fully participate in PFUJ’s nationwide protest call.\n\nKarachi Union of Journalists President Tahir Hassan Khan and General Secretary Sardar Liaquat have also called upon journalists and media workers to gather at the press club at 3pm for the protest.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 28th, 2025",
