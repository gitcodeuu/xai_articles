  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on National Health Services (NHS) at a meeting on Monday expressed concerns about the rapidly increasing cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (Aids).\n\nThe meeting was chaired by MNA Dr Mahesh Kumar Malani and attended by lawmakers and officials of the health ministry.\n\nDr Malani said according to his information 72,000 people suffering from Aids in Pakistan. He said the disease was rapidly increasing in Lahore and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nCoordinator Common Management Unit (CMU) Dr Qasim Abbas said the government was providing free of cost medicine to the patients. He said over 13,000 new cases of HIV were reported in 2024. However, the prime minister’s coordinator on health Dr Malik Mukhtar said the disease had been controlled to some extent but still the situation was worrisome.\n\nThe committee acknowledged the expanded screening and testing services provided by the CMU and emphasised the urgent need to strengthen diagnostic and preventive measures. The rise in HIV cases, especially in high-burden districts, was noted with calls for enhanced monitoring, awareness campaigns and a stronger response to address transmission through high-risk activities. Furthermore, the committee called for improvements in malaria prevention and the scaling up of TB diagnostics in the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 28th, 2025",
