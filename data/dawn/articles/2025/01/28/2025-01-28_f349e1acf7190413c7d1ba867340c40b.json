  "content": "TOKYO: The chairman and president of Japan’s Fuji Television resigned on Monday, weeks after a celebrity presenter was accused of sexual assault, causing a public relations storm and the mass exit of advertisers.\n\nA leading tabloid magazine reported last month that Masahiro Nakai, a J-pop megastar turned TV host, had performed a sexual act without a woman’s consent in 2023.\n\nThe 52-year-old Nakai reportedly later paid the woman 90 million yen ($570,000) and the pair signed a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nAfter network staff were accused of trying to cover up the scandal, dozens of brands, including McDonald’s and Toyota, pulled their advertisements from the private broadcaster.\n\nAs pressure mounted, Fuji TV said its president Koichi Minato and chairman Shuji Kanoh were stepping down.\n\n“I would like to apologise sincerely to the women concerned for failing to provide adequate care due to a lack of awareness of human rights,” Kanoh told reporters on Monday.\n\n“I apologise to the viewers, advertisers, company members, shareholders for the great concern and inconvenience caused by the series of news reports,” he added.\n\nEarlier this month, Minato admitted that Fuji TV was aware of the Nakai scandal before it was reported by local media. The company denies claims that its staff were involved in organising Nakai’s meeting with the woman, which allegedly took place at the star’s home.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 28th, 2025",
