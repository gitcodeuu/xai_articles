Both the accused persons were arrested from Alizai Hospital, police said.\n\nMeanwhile, a sit-in outside the Parachinar Press Club has been called off. The khateeb of Jamia Masjid, Allama Fida Muzahiri, however, warned that the sit-in would be announced again if their demands were not met. “The decision to call off the sit-in has been taken in larger national interest,” he said.\n\nMoreover, the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) has filed an FIR under Sections 324, 353, 427, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code, besides Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, and nominated five people for allegedly being involved in firing on the deputy commissioner.\n\nAccording to the FIR, some 25 to 30 unknown militants opened indiscriminate firing which left Mr Mehsud, Constable Misal Khan and Frontier Constabulary personnel Rahimullah, Rizwan and Nazar Baz severely wounded.\n\nThe KP government has also imposed a ban on displaying arms and unlawful assembly due to the law and order situation in Kurram for 60 days.\n\nA notification issued by the Home and Tribal Affairs Department said the provincial government had learnt through various reliable sources that some disgruntled groups under the gaze of militants would capitalise on the turbulent situation to perpetuate their evil designs and further vitiate the atmosphere of the district.\n\nIt said that in the current precarious situation, gatherings of more than five persons and the display of weapons might further disrupt public peace and tranquillity, keeping in view the current law and order situation and security environment.\n\n“Now, therefore, I, Muhammad Abid Majeed, additional chief secretary of the Home and Tribal Affairs Department KP, on behalf of the provincial government, in exercise of the power conferred upon the provincial government under Section 144 (Clause 6) of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898, do hereby prohibit and impose a ban on all kind of activities, including displaying of weapons and unlawful assembly due to law and order situation in district Kurram,” the notification said.\n\nIt said that anyone contravening the order was liable to be proceeded against under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code, adding that “the order shall come into force immediately and shall remain in force for two months from today [Sunday] unless modified or withdrawn earlier”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 6th, 2025",
