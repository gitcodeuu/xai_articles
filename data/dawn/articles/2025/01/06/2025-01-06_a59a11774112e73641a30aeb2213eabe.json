He claimed that PML-N was the only party that could give tough time to PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nEng Muqam said that Pakistan was making rapid progress under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who has significantly improved Pakistan’s image internationally.\n\n“Foreign investment has started coming to Pakistan, confidence of international monetary institutions restored, stock exchange achieved record progress and price hike decreased considerably due to prudent policies of Shehbaz Sharif government.”\n\nHe said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accorded highest priority to socioeconomic empowerment of youth and, ‘Uraan Pakistan’ initiative had provided an excellent opportunity to youth to contribute to the country’s development progress.\n\nAmir Muqam claimed that KP people were eagerly awaiting the visits of PML-N central leadership to the province.\n\nHe said that whenever difficult situation came on Pakistan the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stood like a rock for defence of the country.\n\nHe said that due to sacrifices of the people of Swat, terrorism had been defeated in Malakand division.\n\nThe federal minister said that he also faced several terror attacks in the past with steadfastness, and always raised voice against terrorism.\n\nHe said courts would decide the cases of PTI founder Imran Khan.\n\nHe claimed that in the 2024 general election, PML-N had emerged as the second largest political party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and that his party enjoyed an important position of the Opposition Leader in KP Assembly.\n\nOn the occasion, Rana Mashood said that socioeconomic empowerment and provision of dignified jobs to youth was the top priority of the government, and the PM youth skills development programme would open gates of employment for them not only in the country but also abroad.\n\nHe said Rs36 billion projects were approved under the prime minister’s youth programme with special focus on their vocational, IT and technical education.\n\nHe said the students of all provinces of Pakistan would be largely facilitated under this landmark initiative. “After necessary education and IT training, these youth would be sent abroad for dignified jobs.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 6th, 2025",
