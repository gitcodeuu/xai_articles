Poor visibility was another factor behind the annulations.\n\nIn Munich, 35 flights were cancelled as a precaution on Saturday evening out of a total of 750 departures and landings scheduled at Germany’s second largest airport, a spokesperson said.\n\nThe meteorological office warned of freezing rain on Sunday after snowfall overnight and recommended passengers avoid unnecessary travel.\n\nNetherlands\n\nAt Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, a major European hub, 68 flights were cancelled and more than 200 were delayed due to snowy conditions, according to the airport website.\n\nSchiphol Airport on its website also warned passengers to check the status of their flight before travelling.\n\nThe cancellations were mainly to European destinations, but long-haul flights also suffered with services scrapped to Newark and Detroit in the United States.\n\nSpain\n\nIn Spain, travellers faced major delays of up to 3.5 hours. Some flights arriving at Madrid and Barcelona airports from European destinations were cancelled, including travel from Frankfurt, Cologne, Munich, Amsterdam, Rotterdam, Liverpool, Manchester, London and Paris, according to the airports’ respective websites.\n\nA spokeswoman for Aena, the company that operates 46 airports in Spain, said “there may be alterations to operations” due to adverse weather in other countries but could not provide any figures.\n\nNone of Spain was affected by snow or ice warnings on Sunday, but a yellow-level warning for wind was in place for parts of the north.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 6th, 2025",
