Now we have reason to believe that Moscow intends to share advanced space and satellite technology with Pyongyang,” Blinken said.\n\nBlinken also renewed concern that Russia, a veto-wielding UN Security Council member, would formally accept North Korea as a nuclear state, which would be a major blow to the global consensus that Pyongyang must end its programme.\n\nUS and South Korean intelligence believe that North Korea late last year sent thousands of troops to fight against Ukraine and has already suffered hundreds of casualties.\n\nIn Tokyo, where Blinken heads later Monday, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced alarm that North Korea’s “technology has been improving”.\n\nThe test comes two weeks before the inauguration of US President-elect Donald Trump, who in his last term sought to woo North Korea with a unique personal diplomacy.\n\nTrump, who once threatened “fire and fury” against North Korea, went on to meet three times with leader Kim Jong Un and said they “fell in love”.\n\nPresident Joe Biden offered a more traditional formula of working-level talks focused on ending North Korea’s nuclear programme.\n\nBlinken defended the outgoing administration’s approach, saying it had reached out to North Korea and only got “more and more provocative actions, including missile launches”.\n\nThe tensions are “not for want of seeking engagement and trying to find a way forward through diplomacy”, he said.\n\nBlinken visited by coincidence on the anniversary of the violent January 6 riot at the US Capitol by Trump’s supporters, after he refused to accept defeat to Biden in the 2020 presidential election.\n\nSupporters of Yoon have waved US flags and invoked Trump by waving signs with his slogan “Stop the Steal”.\n\nBlinken, whose hotel was within earshot of rowdy protests by supporters and opponents of Yoon, steered clear of taking sides in the bitterly divided country.\n\nHe repeated US concern over Yoon’s brief imposition of martial law on December 3 and saluted the “democratic resilience” of South Korea, without commenting on attempts to arrest the president.\n\n“The United States has full confidence in South Korea’s institutions, and we reaffirm our unwavering support for the Korean people as they work tirelessly to uphold those institutions,” Blinken said.\n\nYoon had earlier been a darling of the Biden administration. He was selected to lead a global democracy summit and delighted Washington by moving to turn the page on decades of friction with Japan, a fellow US ally that is also home to thousands of US troops.\n\nYoon joined Biden and Japan’s then-prime minister Fumio Kishida in 2023 for a landmark three-way summit at the Camp David presidential retreat.\n\nSouth Korea’s “foreign policy direction will remain unchanged. I made this clear,” Cho told Blinken.\n\nBlinken also met acting president Choi Sang-mok, a technocrat in the role just over a week, whose office said that South Korea remained committed to the “principles and agreements from the Camp David summit” and to a “strong Korea-US alliance”.\n\nSouth Korea’s progressive opposition, which has made Yoon’s life miserable from parliament and is increasingly ascendant since the president’s power grab, historically has taken a harder line on Japan.\n\nIt has also favoured a more diplomatic approach with North Korea than the hawkish Yoon.",
