But it does not seem to be happening now”.\n\nWhen asked if the PTI would negotiate with the establishment, Mr Raja said the party was open to talking with all actors and it will engage with the establishment as well.\n\nSeparately, PTI legal expert Faisal Chaudhry, speaking to Dawn, said the party was committed to the negotiations for the country’s benefit, not for gaining any advantage for the party itself.\n\n“Imran Khan has said that imprisonment does not make any difference to him and it will not affect the negotiations with the government and others. He has stated that he only wants the establishment of a judicial commission to investigate the May 9 and November 26 incidents. He also clarified that the negotiations have nothing to do with his release,” Mr Chaudhry said, sharing the former prime minister’s message.\n\nIn reply to a question, he warned that if the government did not show seriousness regarding the establishment of the judicial commission, PTI would be left with no option but to stop negotiations with the government.\n\nHe also criticised Senator Siddiqui for his statement and accused the “Form 47 government” of showing mistrust towards security agencies. He said the government was also showing mistrust towards the press release issued by the security agencies. “It seems the government is afraid and puzzled because of the contacts between PTI and other powers.”\n\nSo far, three meetings between the government and PTI have taken place, chaired by NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq. During the last meeting on Jan 16, the PTI presented its charter of demands, including the formation of judicial commissions to investigate the events of May 9, 2023, and Nov 26, 2024, as well as the release of all PTI prisoners.\n\nChallenge to £190m case verdict\n\nMeanwhile, speaking outside Parli­ament House, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said the party would approach the high court against the decision in the £190 million Al Qadir Trust case.\n\nHe said it should be asked from Hasan Nawaz, son of ex-PM Nawaz Sharif, how he transferred Rs40 billion from Pakistan to the UK.\n\nBarrister Gohar claimed that the £190m case was not related to corruption but was a case concerning a trust, asserting that Imran Khan was not involved in corruption.\n\nIn response to a question about the judicial commission, he said that the commission could be established at any time and over any issue. He confirmed that Imran Khan had set a seven-day deadline for the commission’s formation.\n\nPTI leaders Asad Qaiser announced that the party would approach the Islam­abad High Court on Tuesday (today) to challenge the Al Qadir Trust case. He said Imran Khan remained the most popular leader and hinted that the PTI would soon form an alliance with opposition parties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
