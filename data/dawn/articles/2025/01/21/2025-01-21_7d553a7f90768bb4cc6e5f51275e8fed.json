Ltd (ZKB), which was Rs275.25bn.\n\nHowever, ZKB demanded Rs37bn as capital viability gap funding (VGF), while Techno demanded Rs9.5bn.\n\nThe latter didn’t demand any operational VGF, while ZKB demanded Rs143.9bn.\n\nMeanwhile, Techno promised NHA a revenue share of Rs73.58bn, against Rs20.11bn by ZKB.\n\nLow budget for NHA\n\nThe NHA chairman, Sheheryar Sultan, said in the current fiscal year, the progress on road projects has been stagnant as NHA has only been granted Rs161bn against its demand of Rs600bn.\n\nThe NHA was working to enhance the allocation for projects where the physical progress was above 50 per cent, the chairman said.\n\nPM Shehbaz formed a steering committee to monitor these projects and said that all projects of national importance should be completed on a priority basis.\n\nHe also directed the authorities to take stern action against those involved in the theft of fences installed along the motorway. He stressed the need for improving policing and patrolling on highways.\n\nThe meeting was apprised that fences were erected along 4,027km of motorways, of which 859km of fences have either been stolen or damaged.\n\nAs a result, 36 accidents have been repor­ted on motorways during the last four years.\n\nHaj preparations\n\nIn a separate meeting on Monday, PM Shehbaz reviewed preparations for Haj 2025 and vowed not to tolerate any negligence in preparations for the religious ritual as pilgrims were “the guests of Allah Almighty”.\n\nThe prime minister issued directives to ensure all possible facilities and assistance to the pilgrims.\n\nHe sought a comprehensive briefing on the preparations, with details about the selection criteria of Haj assistants, their responsibilities and other arrangements.\n\nThe PM ordered the best possible training facilities for the pilgrims, besides ensuring the selection of capable officers with good repute for Haj duty.\n\nHe said merit and transparency must be ensured in the deployment of the helpers.\n\nThe meeting was briefed in detail about progress on the Haj Fund, which was in final stages.\n\nThe meeting was told that like the previous year, SIM cards will be provided to the pilgrims from Pakistan and a mobile application for their assistance has been made operational.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
