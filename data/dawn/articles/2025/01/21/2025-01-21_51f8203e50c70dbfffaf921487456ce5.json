They are demanding the early release of refund/rebate payments that have been pending for many months.\n\nThe PBS data showed exports of readymade garments rose 22.48pc in value and 10.0pc in quantity during 6MFY25, while knitwear rose 18.42pc in value and 8.87pc in quantity. Bedwear grew 14.75pc in value and 14.27pc in quantity.\n\nTowel exports rose 5.97pc in value and 5.65pc in quantity 6MFY25, whereas cotton cloth went up 4.10pc in value and contracted 1.70pc in quantity, respectively.\n\nYarn exports dipped 37.96pc in 6MFY25.
