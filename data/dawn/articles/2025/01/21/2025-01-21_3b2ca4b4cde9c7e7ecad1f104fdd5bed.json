How­ever, the proposal has now evolved into a matter concerning national security, hu­­man trafficking and smuggling of goods.\n\nThe proposal claims that the FIA currently oversees both immigration functions and white-collar crime investigations, leading to inefficiencies, corruption and the exploitation of vulnerable migrants.\n\n“Tragically, this has contributed to the loss of many Pakistani lives due to illegal immigration attempts,” the official said.\n\nGiven the urgency, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif is expected to take a lead role in driving the necessary reform to overcome bureaucratic delays and ensu­­re swift implementation of meaningful changes to protect citizens.\n\nThe essence of the proposal is to establish an upgra­d­­ed and autonomous authority to manage immigration and border security, as seen in many other countries, while allowing the FIA to focus on investigating white-collar crimes and money laundering.\n\nThe argument is that several regional countries, including India, Bangladesh, Iran, China, Tajikistan, Afghanistan and Turkiye, have adopted similar structures to ensure efficiency.\n\nFor example, India has a Bureau of Immigration to manage immigration, while the CBI handles white-collar crimes. Bangladesh separates immigration and passport controls from the anti-corruption commission.\n\nIn Iran, the immigration and passport police govern immigration, while the Economic Crimes Police handles financial crimes. Similarly, China has a separate National Immigration Administ­ra­tion, and Turkiye’s Directorate General of Migration Management oversees immigration, while the Financial Crimes Investigation Board handles financial crimes and money laundering.\n\n“The current system, where immigration and law enforcement overlap, is ineffective and vulnerable to corruption. A separate PBCA would ensure better border control, reduce human trafficking, and prevent further tragedies,” the proposal claims.\n\nTo ensure speedy implementation, the relevant authorities are seeking passage of the bill for legislative coverage within a month.\n\nTo address concerns within the bureaucracy, the proposal suggests appointing a grade-22 officer of the civil service to lead the authority, followed by at least three grade-21 officers for the central, southern and northern borders.\n\nThere would also be a series of (at least six) grade-20 director-level officers from the police at all entry-exit points, with three brigadier commanders directly leading the borders with Afghanistan, Iran, China and India, including the areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. Each director would be supported by personnel with military or administrative service experience to ensure operational efficiency.\n\nAbout two months after the legislation, the authority is expected to be up and running within six months, with a transition of force from the FIA occurring within two months.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
