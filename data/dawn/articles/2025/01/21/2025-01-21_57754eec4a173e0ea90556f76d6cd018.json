Lowari, Kumrat and Doog Dara were blanketed in white after snowfall for two days.\n\nA large number of local youth and children thronged the Lowari Top and Kumrat to enjoy the first winter snowfall.\n\nThe district administration asked the tourists to take precautionary measures before visiting the snow-covered areas in Upper and Lower Dir.\n\nThe downpour in plains on Monday broke the prolonged dry spell that turned the weather chilly forcing the inmates to remain indoors in both the districts. The much-awaited rain started in the morning at about 10am that continued till evening. The farmers and agriculturists termed the rain beneficial for wheat and other crops.\n\nMeanwhile, upper parts of Hazara division received snowfall and rain, significantly dropping temperatures across the region.\n\nThe snowfall, which began in the early hours, continued intermittently throughout the day in Mansehra, Torghar, Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, and Kolai-Palas districts.\n\nThe rain also broke the prolonged dry spell that had been causing respiratory tract infections in the region. Snowfall in the high-altitude areas continued intermittently throughout the day.\n\nThe Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road, connecting the tourist resort of Shogran, was closed to traffic due to snowfall. Police and Rescue 1122 personnel deployed along the road restricted visitors from proceeding further due to icy conditions.\n\nAlso, a fresh spell of snowfall started in upper parts of Shangla on Sunday night, decreasing the mercury below the freezing point and forcing the inhabitants to stay indoors.\n\nThe snowfall and rain continued to lash the district till Monday evening.\n\nAlpuri assistant commissioner Mohammad Hamid Saddiqui told reporters that heavy machinery had been dispatched to the snowbound areas for clearing roads.\n\nBoth the Lower and Upper South Waziristan districts received heavy snowfall and rain on Monday night.\n\nHilly areas along the Pak-Afghan border such as Angoor Adda, Shakai, Ladha, Makin, Khamrang, Zam China and Pareghal received snowfall. The precipitation significantly intensified the cold in the region, with chilly winds blowing across.\n\nThe snowfall transformed areas into a breathtaking winter wonderland, enhancing their natural beauty. However, it also brought challenges to the locals as snow blocked access to mountainous areas, causing difficulties for residents.\n\nAccording to Wazir and Mehsud tribesmen, lack of facilities in the hilly areas exacerbated the challenges for them.\n\nThey appealed to the government to establish tourist points along the Pak-Afghan border.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
