If all goes according to plan, the first phase of the truce would last six weeks during which the parties would negotiate a permanent ceasefire, which has not been agreed yet.\n\nDespite the risks, hundreds of Palestinians were streaming through an apocalyptic landscape in Jabalia in northern Gaza, one of the worst-hit areas.\n\n“We are finally in our home. There is no home left, just rubble, but it’s our home,” said Rana Mohsen, 43.\n\nThe initial 42-day truce was brokered by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt.\n\nIt should enable a surge of sorely needed humanitarian aid into Gaza, as more Israeli prisoners are released in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli custody and Israeli forces leave some areas.\n\nDuring the initial phase of the truce, 33 Israeli prisoners are due to be returned from Gaza in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinians.\n\nReunited\n\nThe first three released — Emily Damari, Romi Gonen and Doron Steinbrecher — returned to Israel after Hamas fighters handed them over to the Red Cross in a bustling square in Gaza City on Sunday.\n\n“In Emily’s own words, she is the happiest girl in the world; she has her life back,” Damari’s mother said on Monday, adding that her daughter was “doing much better than any of us could have expected” even after losing two fingers.\n\nIn Tel Aviv, there was elation among the crowd who had waited for hours for the news of their rele­ase, with a campaign group hailing their return as “a beacon of light”.\n\nJournalist Avi Issacharoff lashed out against the Israeli government for what he said was its failure “to engage in any way on the ‘day after’ the war”.\n\nFollowing the return of the three prisoners, the Israel Prison Service confirmed the release of 90 Palestinian prisoners early on Monday.\n\nIn the West Bank town of Beitun­­ia, near Ofer prison, Palestinians cheered and chanted as buses carrying prisoners arrived, with some climbing atop and unfurling a Hamas flag.\n\n“All the prisoners being released today feel like family to us. They are part of us, even if they’re not blood relatives,” Amanda Abu Sharkh, 23, told AFP.\n\nOne freed detainee, Abdul Aziz Muhammad Atawneh, described prison as “hell, hell, hell”.\n\nThe next prisoner swap should take place on Saturday, a senior Hamas official said.\n\nGaza to be rebuilt\n\nAs the war devastated much of the Palestinian territory and displaced millions of people, Hamas on Monday vowed that Gaza and its people would “rise again”.\n\n“Gaza, with its great people and its resilience, will rise again to rebuild what the occupation has destroyed,” Hamas said.\n\nFor many Israelis yearning for a future free from war and for the release of prisoners still held in Gaza, Trump’s return to the White House is a source of hope.\n\nMany Israelis have been looking forward to his return for a while, even ahead of the ceasefire.\n\nUN relief chief Tom Fletcher said 630 trucks carrying desperately-needed aid had entered Gaza in the hours after the start of the truce, with 300 of them headed to the north of the territory.\n\nQatar said that 12.5 million litres of fuel would enter Gaza over the first 10 days of the truce.\n\nThe World Food Programme said it was moving full throttle to get food to Palestinians. “We’re trying to reach a million people within the shortest possible time,” said WFP official, Carl Skau.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
