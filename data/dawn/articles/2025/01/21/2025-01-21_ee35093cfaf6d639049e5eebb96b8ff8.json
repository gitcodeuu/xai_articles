Launch public awareness campaigns focusing on preventive measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing. Disseminate information about the symptoms of Covid-19 and H1N1 and the importance of seeking timely medical care,” it says.\n\nMeanwhile, health minister Dr Azra Fazal Peechuho in a public video message dispelled the fears over the spread of Covid-19.\n\n“There is no Covid-19 epidemic. Out of the 100 plus patients tested for Covid-19, only seven were positive for the infection. They had mild illness,” she said, emphasising that the few Covid-19 cases being detected were treated as a flu case.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
