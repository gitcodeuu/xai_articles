The police arrested the suspect, Adeel.\n\nA murder case was lodged against him on the complaint of the deceased’s son Babar Khan.\n\nHe alleged in the FIR that his father was taking a walk on the rooftop of his house when the suspect opened fire after exchanging harsh words with his father.\n\nThe suspect was running a motor workshop near the residence of Niazi and used to park cars outside the workshop, causing inconveniences to the local residents. Inspector Niazi had suggested to him to park the cars inside his workshop.\n\nBabar alleged that Adeel nourished a grudge against his father and killed him.\n\nThe suspect, however, told the police that the police inspector used to insult and humiliate him many times, prompting him to take the extreme step.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 22nd, 2024",
