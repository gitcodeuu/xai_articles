He said he was leaving at a time of “significant successes” for the military, though he also said that “not all” of Israel’s war goals had been achieved.\n\nMajor General Yaron Finkelman, the head of Israel’s southern military command, which is responsible for Gaza, also resigned.\n\n‘Good faith’\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar’s PM said on Tuesday that a lasting peace in Gaza would depend on Israel and Hamas acting in “good faith”, days into a fragile truce in the Palestinian territory mediated by the Gulf state.\n\n“If they are embarking in this in good faith, this will last and hopefully will lead to phase two, will lead to a permanent ceasefire,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani told the World Economic Forum in Davos.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 22nd, 2024",
