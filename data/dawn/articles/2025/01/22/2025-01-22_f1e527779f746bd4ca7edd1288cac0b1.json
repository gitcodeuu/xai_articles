  "content": "Turkiye was preparing to bury its dead on Wednesday a day after a huge fire killed 76 people at a ski resort hotel, as questions grew over safety measures at the luxury establishment.\n\nNine people have been detained, including the owner of the hotel, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.\n\nAs the nation observed a day of mourning, dozens of families were preparing to bury their loved ones who died as the blaze ripped through the 12-storey hotel.\n\nBut alongside the grief, there was anger, with many newspapers publishing allegations of negligence at the mountaintop hotel in Kartalkaya, which lies about two hours northwest of Ankara.\n\n“It was not the fire but the negligence which was responsible for so many deaths,” said the pro-government Hurriyet newspaper.\n\nThe fire, which began in the dead of night, struck at peak season for the Grand Kartal Hotel, which had 238 guests staying at the start of a two-week winter break.\n\nThe hotel expressed deep sorrow in a statement on Wednesday and pledged full cooperation with the investigation.\n\n“We are cooperating with authorities to shed light on all aspects of this incident,” the statement said. “We are deeply saddened by the losses and want you to know that we share this pain with all our hearts.”\n\nMore than 30 people remained in hospital on Wednesday, one of whom was in intensive care, officials said.\n\nOn a freezing foggy morning, with flags flying at half-mast, rescuers resumed their search of the charred and blackened structure on Wednesday, where Turkish media said entire families had died.\n\nAmong those who were to be buried on Wednesday was a neurologist, his wife and their three children, including twin boys.\n\nThe blaze broke out around 3:30 am (5:30am PKT), sending huge clouds of smoke into the night air and sparking panic among the guests, many of whom tried to climb out of the windows, using bedsheets as ropes.\n\n“I saw one kid hanging from the hotel window calling for help,” said Islam, who works at a nearby hotel and did not give his surname.\n\n“I was profoundly disturbed. I still cannot forget the image,” he told AFP, saying he knew some of the hotel staff who died.\n\nBy Tuesday night, investigators had identified 52 of the dead and returned 45 bodies to their families for burial, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan was expected to attend the funeral of seven family members of a local official from his ruling AKP in the nearby town of Bolu.\n\nYerlikaya said nine people, including the owner, had been arrested in connection with the blaze, with investigators looking into the cause of the fire, possible negligence and who was responsible.\n\nSpeaking to Turkish media on Tuesday, several guests said that no fire alarms nor smoke alarms had sounded and that there were no fire escapes.\n\n“No fire alarm went off… and there was no fire escape,” Atakan Yelkovan told IHA news agency, saying it had taken “between an hour and an hour-and-a-half” for the firefighters to arrive.\n\nBut Tourism Minister Nuri Ersoy said the hotel had two fire escapes and had passed inspections “in 2021 and 2024”.\n\n“No issues related to fire safety had been flagged by the fire department,” he said on Tuesday.",
