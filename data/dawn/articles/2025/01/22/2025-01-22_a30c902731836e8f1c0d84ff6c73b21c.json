  "content": "SAYED Zulfiqar Bukh­ari, a close aide of Imran Khan, has claimed he fa­­c­ed immense pressure to te­­­stify against the former pri­­­me minister in the Al-Qa­­­­­dir Trust corruption case.\n\nSpeaking to The Indep­endent, Zulfi Bukhari clai­med authorities offered him lucrative deals, but he refused.\n\n“Anybody whose name is involved in this case was offered all sorts of deals (to testify) against Imran Khan. Luckily, none of them took that offer — not the busine­ssman, not myself,” said Mr Bu­khari, who currently ser­­ves as the PTI founder’s international media advi­ser and is based in London since he fled Pakistan after a crackdown.\n\nThe Al-Qadir Trust case is centred around the alleged misuse of £190m that was repatriated from UK via the National Crime Agency, to benefit property tycoon Malik Riaz. Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were convicted last week, receiving sentences of 14 and seven years respectively.\n\nMr Bukhari described the pressure he faced, stating, “From kidnapping fa­­mily members, destroying homes, businesses, blocking bank accounts, stripping me of all my land… no pressure tactic was left. It was a two-pronged attack — carrot and a stick.”\n\nHe argued that the case is politically motivated and lacks evidence of financial gain. “The £190m… is sitt­i­­ng with the Supreme Court of Pakistan. That money is actually earning interest… this whole narrative… is absolute rubbish,” he said.\n\nImran Khan, speaking from Adiala Jail, confirmed that Bukhari was offered deals to testify, but refused. “This has resulted in his business being destroyed, family members displaced,” the publication quoted Mr Khan as saying.\n\nBukhari also told The In­­dependent that was add­ed as a defendant in the case after refusing to appear in court, citing fears of arrest.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 22th, 2025",
