He said that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway was the need of the hour and added that the resolution must be adopted so that the federation knew what was happening with the province.\n\nCriticising the Centre for “ignoring” Sindh in federally-funded development projects, PPP member Nisar Khuhro said that now the comparison of provinces in the development projects was being done due to the lethargy of the federal government.\n\nHe asked as to why the federal government did not include M-9 Motorway in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\n\nDeputy Speaker Naveed Anthony adjourned the house to Friday immediately after the adoption of Ms Soho’s resolution.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 22th, 2025",
