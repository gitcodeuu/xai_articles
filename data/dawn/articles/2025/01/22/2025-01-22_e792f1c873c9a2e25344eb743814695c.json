He emphasised the need for democratic forces to unite on a shared platform to address the challenges.\n\nHe also announced that a follow-up meeting would take place in the coming days to outline a clear agenda for the country’s progress.\n\nMr Khokhar said there was a need to work together on issues, such as terrorism, economy, politics, democracy, and adherence to the Constitution.\n\n“According to a World Bank re­­port (issued) last week, about 15 million more Pakistanis have fal­len below the poverty line during the last year,” he said, claiming that “Hindutva is eying the nat­ion” and relations with Afgha­nis­tan were deteriorating as “our po­licy has completely failed there”.\n\n“It is also believed that the proxy war between the United States and China will be fought in Balo­chistan,” the ex-senator opined.\n\nOpposition Leader Omar Ayub stressed that a single agenda which united them was the ‘supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law’.\n\n“We seek a judicially independent and free electoral process to restore public confidence,” he said, claiming that the mismanagement by the government, including the underutilisation of the development budget had worsened the economic crisis. Only 9pc funds were spent out of Rs1,400 billion.\n\nAdil Bazai’s case\n\nMeanwhile, the PTI hailed the Supreme Court’s detailed judgement in MNA Adil Bazai’s de-seating case and said that the apex court’s judgement established the Election Commission of Pakistan’s prejudice.\n\nPTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram stated that the ECP’s conduct in the said case substantiated their arguments regarding the ECP’s consistent bias and prejudice against the PTI.\n\nAbout the continuation of the dialogue with the government, he emphasised that the onus was on the government to respond, as the PTI had already submitted its ‘charter of demands’ and the government was obligated to respond within seven working days.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 22th, 2025",
