  "content": "MELBOURNE: A vintage Novak Djokovic tamed Carlos Alcaraz in a late-night blockbuster to set up an Australian Open semi-final with Alexander Zverev as two-time women’s defending champion Aryna Sabalenka fought on.\n\nThe 37-year-old Djokovic rolled back the years at the scene of his greatest achievements on Rod Laver Arena in Melbourne with a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 triumph sealed close to 1:00 am.\n\nThe Serb surged into the semi-finals and a date with world number two Zverev to edge closer to an 11th Melbourne crown and all-time record 25th Slam title.\n\n“I just wish that this match today was the final,” said Djokovic, who had to have his thigh heavily strapped and appeared to be labouring at the end of the first set. “Just one of the most epic matches I have played on this court, any court really.”\n\nWith former rival Andy Murray now in his coaching corner, Djokovic was at his imperious and defiant best, cupping his ear to the crowd after winning big points.\n\nDjokovic was at the centre of a row on Monday after he demanded an apology — and got one — from a local TV presenter for what he called “insulting and offensive comments”.\n\nSpain’s world number three Alcaraz will have to wait another year to get a kangaroo tattoo. He had vowed to get one if he won the Australian Open for the first time.\n\nThe 21-year-old four-time major champion has still never been bey­ond the Melbourne Park last eight.\n\nHe felt he should have rammed home the advantage when Djoko­vic was struggling with his movement.\n\n“Yeah, I saw that he had issues just moving a little bit. I had to push him a little bit more to the limit. I didn’t do it,” Alcaraz said. “After that, he started to feel better and played such a great level. That was my biggest mistake today.\n\n“Obviously when Novak is at this level, it’s difficult. I had my chances. It was a really close match. I think most of the crucial points, it went to his side. When Novak is playing at this level, it’s really difficult to find the way.”\n\nFormer number one Djokovic extended his career advantage over Alcaraz to 5-3, having also beaten him in the Paris Olympics final in their last meeting.\n\nAlcaraz got the better of his rival in the 2023 and 2024 Wimbledon finals.\n\nIn hot and windy conditions, Germany’s Zverev defeated the American Tommy Paul 7-6 (7/1), 7-6 (7/0), 2-6, 6-1 to step up his quest to win a Grand Slam for the first time.\n\nThe 27-year-old lost his cool at one point — because of a feather.\n\nThe umpire called for a replay when the feather drifted in front of him as he played a shot at a critical juncture.\n\n“C’mon, that is unbelievable on break point,” he shouted, before taking out his fury on Paul by breaking to love.\n\nWorld number one and defending champion Jannik Sinner plays home hope Alex de Minaur in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, the winner facing American 21st seed Ben Shelton or the unseeded Italian Lorenzo Sonego.\n\nSabalenka will face Paula Badosa in the last four as the Belarusian bids to win the Australian Open for a third time in a row, something last achieved 26 years ago by Martina Hingis.\n\nThe world number one kept that dream alive but had to battle for it in beating Russian 27th seed Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 2-6, 6-3 in the wind.\n\n“Honestly I was just praying, trying to put the ball back in these tough conditions,” said Sabalenka. “I’m just super happy I was able to somehow magically win this match.”\n\nAt 33, Pavlyuchenkova had been enjoying a late-career renaissance and was the oldest remaining woman in the draw.\n\nSabalenka next plays Badosa, the Spanish 11th seed who stunned world number three Coco Gauff 7-5, 6-4.\n\nBadosa is into her first Slam semi-final at the age of 27.\n\n“I’m a bit emotional,” said Badosa. “I’m a very emotional person. I wanted to play my best game. I think I did it.”\n\nIt capped a remarkable comeback for the Spaniard, who was ran­ked outside the top 100 a year ago after a stress fracture in her back.\n\n“I mean, a year ago, I was here with my back and I didn’t know if I had to retire from this sport, and now I’m here playing against the best in the world,” said Badosa.\n\nThird-seeded American Gauff, 20, described herself as “disappointed but not completely crus­hed” after her first defeat of 2025.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iga Swiatek will look to continue her march to a first Australian Open title when she faces Emma Navarro.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2025",
