It said that the Water Apportionment Accord, 1991, was a consensus document and any amendment shall be with the agreement of all provinces through CCI.\n\n“In view of the above, it is proposed that the matter may be taken to the Council of Common Interests (CCI) for conveying the stance of the province as well as repealing the recent amendments in Irsa Act, 1992,” the document read.\n\nIt said that the law minister suggested placing the matter to the cabinet.\n\n“The cabinet is requested to decide the case to forward the stance of the provincial government to place the matter to the CCI regarding the amendment of Irsa Act, 1992,” it read.\n\nThe document said that original Section 4(1) of Irsa Act, 1992, which states that the authority shall consist of five members, one each to be nominated by each province and the federal government from amongst high-ranking engineers in Irrigation or related engineering fields, has been substituted.\n\n“The Authority shall comprise of a chairman and four members, each member to be nominated by each chief minister of the respective provinces from amongst high-ranking engineers, with relevant engineering, irrigation or related experience as may be prescribed. The chairman shall be an employee of the federal government, who is serving or has served in BPS-21 or equivalent or above, to be appointed by the Prime Minister, with such engineering experience and on such terms and conditions as the Prime Minister may determine, from time to time,” the substituted section 4(1) read.\n\nThe document stated that the provincial irrigation department was of the view that the final authority to decide cases on distribution of surface water has been shifted to the federal government which will hamper the balance established under section 4 of Irsa Act, 1992.\n\nOn October 10 last year, the KP Assembly passed a unanimous resolution calling for not amending the Irsa Act, 1992. The resolution read that the Water Apportionment Accord, 1991, and Irsa Act, 1992, was an effective agreement between the provinces regarding the distribution of water.\n\nIt said that KP people would never accept any amendments to the Irsa Act and it would also violate the basics of federalism. Besides, the amendment also said that the assembly requested the federal government to implement the Water Apportionment Accord, 1991, in letter and spirit and should also not amend Irsa Act, 1992.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2025",
