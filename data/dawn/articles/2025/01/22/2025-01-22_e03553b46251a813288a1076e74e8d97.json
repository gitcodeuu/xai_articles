They said that they would sever the gas pipeline passing through the district if the kidnapped workers were not released.\n\nThey also threatened to close the main entry of the Qaboolkhel project site and boycott upcoming anti-polio drives.\n\nMeanwhile, relatives of the kidnapped employees and some elders called on Deputy Commissioner Zeeshan Abdullah at his office on Tuesday.\n\nThey told him that the incident caused unrest among locals. They said that local authorities should expedite their efforts for the safe release of kidnapped workers.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that on Jan 9, armed men kidnapped 17 private PAEC workers along with their driver when they were going to the project site located at Qaboolkhel area in a private coach.\n\nThe kidnappers later abandoned the coach and set it on fire in the forest along the Kurrum River. After the incident, police and security forces launched an operation and freed eight workers, three in injured condition, from the captors.\n\nDuring the last 10 days, several videos purportedly showing the hostages appeared on social media wherein the kidnapped workers could be heard as appealing to the government to accept the demands of their captors to secure their release.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 22nd, 2025",
