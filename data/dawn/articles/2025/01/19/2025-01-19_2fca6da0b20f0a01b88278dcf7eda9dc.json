Now police claimed to have traced the location of the missing journalist’s mobile phone in Ghauspur, Kandhkot-Kashmore district.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by CM’s spokesman, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has sought report from Sindh IGP on the incident and instructed police to ensure recovery of the journalist.\n\nThe CM directed local police to stay in touch with the journalist’s family, it said.\n\nOn Saturday, a large number of journalists and members of general public staged a demonstration at Hingorja and Khairpur press clubs against police’s failure to recover Solangi.\n\nThe protesters’ leaders warned if Solangi was not rescued unharmed within 24 hours they would not only expand their protest but also block National Highway in Hingorja for an indefinite period.\n\nThey said that Solangi’s abduction had raised questions over the performance of Sindh police. If journalists were not safe in their areas, then what could one say about common people, they said.\n\nJournalists in Nawabshah, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Ghotki and Kandhkot-Kashmore also staged protests outside press clubs and took out processions, demanding immediate recovery of Solangi.\n\nThey said that journalists had always supported the oppressed but it was a pity that now they were themselves being oppressed. They warned if Solangi was not recovered immediately, they would stage a strong protest.\n\nJournalists in Khanpur Mahar demanded safe recovery of Solangi and protested against registration of ‘fake’ cases against journalist Jalal Bozdar in Mirpur Mathelo.\n\nThey said that journalists were being harassed but Sindh government had failed to protect them.\n\nIn Nawabshah, journalists staged a demonstration outside local press club and said that journalists were killed, kidnapped and forced into hiding but government had done nothing to provide them any protection.\n\nThey condemned Solangi’s kidnapping and demanded the government ensure his immediate recovery. Similar protests were held in Naushahro Feroze, Kan-diaro and other towns.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
