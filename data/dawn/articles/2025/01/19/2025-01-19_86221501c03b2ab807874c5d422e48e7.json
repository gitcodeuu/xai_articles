  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Lahore High Court’s (LHC) Rawalpindi bench has deliberated to address a controversy related to the Punjab governor and chief minister’s powers to constitute the board of governors (BoGs) of the Murree Lawrence College.\n\nIn this regard, LHC Justice Jawad Hassan summoned the Punjab higher education secretary and acting principal of the Lawrence College on Feb 7, seeking clarification on the modus operandi for the removal, inclusion of BoG members, appointment of the principal and other related matters.\n\nThe matter was brought before the court by Senator Sadia Abbasi through Barrister Zafarullah Khan.\n\nAccording to sources, the previous BoG was constituted in 2022 and the then Punjab governor, Balighur Rehman, had appointed Senator Sadia Abbasi and Musharraf Rasool among others as board members.\n\nPunjab education secretary, college’s acting principal summoned on Feb 7\n\nThe incumbent governor, however, removed the five members after they insisted on the appointment of a regular principal as the college was being run on an ad hoc basis for eight years.\n\nLater on, a board comprising retired Lt-Gen Hamid Rabnawaz, retired Maj-Gen Owais Mushtaq, retired Rear Admiral Mian Zahir Shah, Sarfraz Bugti, Ikram Sehgal and others was reconstituted.\n\nThe new board reportedly issued an advertisement for the appointment of a new principal.\n\nBarrister Khan argued that the removal of previous board members violated the Punjab Educational Institutions (Reconstitution) Act, 2021.\n\nHe contended that under Section 7 (2) of the Act, board members were appointed for a fixed term of three years and could only be removed under specific conditions.\n\nFurthermore, he claimed their removal was conducted without a fair hearing, contravening Section 7 (3) of the Act.\n\nHe emphasised that this lack of due process violated their constitutional rights under Articles 4 and 10-A, which guarantee treatment according to the law and the right to a fair trial.\n\nAdditional Advocate-General Malik Amjad Ali defended the decision, stating that the reconstitution of the board was carried out following Article 105 of the constitution, with the advice of the Punjab chief minister.\n\nHe argued that the initial appointments in 2023 were irregular and lacked proper legal backing.\n\nThe state counsel also emphasised the secretary of higher education department’s authority under the Punjab Government Rules of Business, 2011, to administer such changes in consultation with the governor.\n\nThe court highlighted the significance of procedural fairness and questioned whether the respondents had acted within the bounds of the law, especially regarding the alleged lack of consultation with the chief minister during the initial appointments.\n\nThe court directed the Punjab higher education secretary and the acting principal of Lawrence College Murree to appear in person at the next hearing to clarify the reconstitution process.\n\nIt also sought a detailed report on whether the removal followed legal requirements, particularly in light of relevant constitutional provisions and precedents.\n\nThe court adjourned the case, scheduling the next hearing for February 7, 2025.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
