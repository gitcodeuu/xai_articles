That deal also saw the release of prisoners from both sides.\n\nThe government had approved the prisoner return plan, the office of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said after the cabinet vote. It said the deal “supports achieving the objectives of the war”.\n\nBut Hamas said Israel had “failed to achieve its aggressive goals” and “only succeeded in committing war crimes that disgrace the dignity of humanity”.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Saturday that Israel reserves the right to resume fighting in Gaza with US support, as he pledged to bring home all prisoners held in the Palestinian territory.\n\n“We reserve the right to resume the war if necessary, with American support,” Netanyahu said in a televised statement.\n\nHe said the 42-day first phase, which starts on Sunday, was a “temporary ceasefire”. “If we are forced to resume the war, we will do so with force,” Netanyahu said.\n\nMediator Egypt said that Israel is to release more than 1,890 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for 33 Israelis in the first phase of the truce.\n\nThe foreign ministry said the prisoners would be freed during the first, 42-day phase of the ceasefire.\n\nHowever, Israel’s justice ministry said 737 Palestinian prisoners and detainees would be freed as part of the deal’s first phase — none before 4pm (1400 GMT) on Sunday.\n\nQatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani has said an initial 42-day ceasefire would see 33 prisoners released by Hamas in Gaza.\n\nSheikh Mohammed told Sky News that the framework signed this week was the same as one agreed on Dec 23, adding that it amounted to “13 months of a waste of negotiating details”.\n\nAlso in the first phase, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza’s densely populated areas and allow displaced Palestinians to return “to their residences”, the Qatari prime minister said.\n\nAn Israeli military official said reception points had been established at Kerem Shalom, Erez and Reim, where prisoners would be joined by doctors and mental health specialists before being “transported via helicopter or vehicle” to hospitals in Israel.\n\nIsrael “is then expected to release the first group of Palestinian prisoners, including several with high sentences”, a source said on condition of anonymity.\n\nPA control in Gaza\n\nThe truce is to take effect on the eve of Donald Trump’s inauguration for a second term as US president.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority, which has partial administrative control in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has completed preparations “to assume full responsibility in Gaza” after the war.\n\nIsrael has expressed no definitive stance on post-war governance beyond rejecting any role for either Hamas or the PA.\n\nOutgoing US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Gaza should be under PA control.\n\nAhead of the truce, displaced people of Gaza prepared to return home.\n\n“I will go to kiss my land,” said Nasr al-Gharabli, who fled his home in Gaza City for a camp further south. “If I die on my land, it would be better than being here as a displaced person.”\n\nJerusalem residents said the deal had been a long time coming. Hopefully a maximum amount of prisoners will be coming back, said Beeri Yemeni, a university student. “Maybe this is the beginning of (the) end of suffering for both sides, hopefully,” he said, adding that “the war needed to end like a long time ago.”\n\nIsrael’s cabinet endorsement of the deal came despite eight ministers voting against it, including far-right ministers Itamar Ben Gvir and Bezalel Smotrich.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
