  "content": "CHARSADDA: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday said that current assemblies had no significance, adding that the very basis of these legislatures was controversial.\n\nSpeaking at a graduation ceremony at Darul Uloom Islamia, he pointed out that fraudulent and rigged elections should not be used to mislead the masses.\n\nHe said that Hasina Wajid of Bangladesh had also won elections in a similar manner, but what fate she met is for everyone to see.\n\nMaulana Fazl regretted that the purpose of the politics today had become solely to gain power and positions.\n\nAlleges conspiracies being hatched against seminaries\n\nHe said conspiracies were being hatched against seminaries at the global level to undermine the role of religious scholars.\n\nHowever, he said, madressahs and ulema would continue to play their positive role to thwart such conspiracies.\n\nHe was accompanied by the head of the seminary and party’s district leader, Maulana Gohar Shah, district spokesperson Haq Nawaz Durrani, and others.\n\nMaulana Fazl praised the religious scholars’ contribution to society, adding that they were making efforts to spread the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).\n\nHe came down hard on the provincial government, saying it had completely failed to deliver.\n\nHe recalled that the JUI-F had played an important role during the passage of the 26th amendment. He said it was because of their efforts that 34 controversial clauses had been deleted from the original draft and Islamic clauses added to it.\n\nHe stressed that the protection of madressahs and politics was the responsibility of religious scholars.\n\nHe criticised the country’s leaders, adding that in the name of Islam such leaders were mocking the faith.\n\nThe JUI-F chief asserted that the country does not belong to any individual or aristocracy but to all citizens, including bureaucrats and establishment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
