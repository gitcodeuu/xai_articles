The directors welcomed the selectivity of the CPF and its focus on six core outcomes.\n\nThey appreciated the strong one World Bank Group approach, and the proposed reliance on global knowledge, private sector solutions, and the increased focus on the data, monitoring and evaluation agenda to track progress and ensure strong and lasting results.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
