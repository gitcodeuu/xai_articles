  "content": "SWABI: MNA and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser has said that despite the court’s verdict against Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan and his wife in the Al-Qadir Trust case, the former prime minister has decided to continue negotiations with the government for ‘prosperity and rule of law’ in the country.\n\nAddressing party workers here on Saturday, he accused former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, his daughter and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and defence minister Khawaja Asif of trying to derail the negotiation process between the government and the opposition.\n\nMr Qaiser claimed that the PTI strived to continue talks with the government in the best interest of the country. “Relations with India are already at the lowest ebb, and now ties with Afghanistan have also been strained, and Pakistan has been isolated,” he said.\n\n“The party started talks with the government to help tackle various internal and external challenges confronted by the country,” he remarked.\n\nEx-NA speaker accuses Nawaz, Maryam of trying to derail negotiations\n\nMr Qaiser said that the life in the strategically important merged districts had been paralysed, and people were fed up with the breakdown of law and order. “Looking at these complicated scenarios, we initiated talks with the government while striving for peace and prosperity of the country.”\n\nHe said that peace was a prerequisite for economic prosperity of Pakistan. The PTI leader said that the party initiated the dialogue process despite the fact that it was deprived of its mandate in the last general election.\n\nQaiser warned that no formula sans Imran Khan was acceptable to the party.\n\nHe said that PTI leaders had met former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in Islamabad recently and they wanted to talk to leaders of other political and religious parties to steer the country out of the multiple crises.\n\nHe said that PTI strived for an independent judiciary, which is very critical for provision of speedy justice to litigants.\n\nMeanwhile, PTI leaders have said that a Rs200 million irrigation project would be launched in Panjpir village.\n\nThey stated this while speaking a condolence reference held here for Gohar Khan, a former PTI district general secretary, who passed away recently.\n\nThe participants said the Swabi Bypass would be named after the deceased PTI leader due to his contribution for the party during critical times.\n\nHis colleagues said that Mr Gohar had played a great role for the progress of the region, and the irrigation department project, which couldn’t be launched during his lifetime, but was decided by the ruling party leaders that his wish would be met despite the financial constraints of the provincial government.\n\nAqibullah Khan, provincial minister for irrigation, said that the PC-1 of the project would be finalised soon and the project would be completed on priority.\n\nAbdul Karim, adviser to the chief minister on industry, commerce and technical education, said that it was very difficult to fill the void created by the death Gohar Khan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
