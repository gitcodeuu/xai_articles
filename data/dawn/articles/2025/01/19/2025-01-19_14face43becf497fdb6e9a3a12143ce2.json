This group includes 25,000 destined for the United States, 9,000 for Australia, 6,000 for Canada, 3,000 for Germany, and more than 1,000 for the United Kingdom.\n\nFresh figures on the relocation process were not provided by the FO or other involved ministries. However, the slow pace of relocation since the initiative began in late 2021 suggests minimal progress.\n\nOver the past three years, Pakistan has engaged with the governments that had pledged to resettle these individuals, urging them to expedite the approval and visa processes.\n\nThe resettlement efforts followed the evacuation of over 120,000 Afghans during the chaotic US-led Nato withdrawal from Afghanistan. Since then, approximately 1.25 million Afghans have fled the Taliban rule, with an estimated 600,000 entering Pakistan.\n\nDespite early momentum, the relocation process slowed significantly, leaving thousands in lim­bo. In November 2023, Pakistan initiated a drive to expel undocumen­ted foreigners, affecting Afghans. To date, more than 815,000 individuals have been repatriated. Reports suggesting forced repatriation of Afghans awaiting relocation were denied by Islamabad.\n\nUnder international pressure, the government directed law enforcement agencies not to detain Afghans approved for third-country relocation during the crackdown on migrants.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
