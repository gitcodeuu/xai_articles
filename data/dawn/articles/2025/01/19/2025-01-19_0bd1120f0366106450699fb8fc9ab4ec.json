The conference will bring together leaders, experts, and innovators to collaborate on strategies that address the climate crisis while supporting economic growth and lessening the negative impact of climate change on the destinies of the most vulnerable segments of the population — the poor, women and children.\n\n“By stimulating open dialogue and practical solutions, we aim to strengthen Pakistan’s resilience against climate change,” said a Dawn spokesperson. “Pakistan is the fifth most climate-vulnerable country in the world. From rising temperatures to erratic rainfall, climate change is putting our communities, environment, and economy at risk.\n\n“Meaningful change is possible—and it needs to begin with us. Breathe Pakistan is not simply about awareness. It calls for an immediate and considered action. It requires every Pakistani to take ownership of our environment, to contribute to a wide-ranging policy on climate change, and to lay the foundations for a climate-resilient Pakistan,” the Dawn spokesperson concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
