He said the horn of the nine-year-old trophy measured 38 inches.\n\nHe said that the other winners of the permits in different protected areas were reaching here to accomplish the trophy hunting, but the continued inclement weather and snowfall in the length and breadth of Chitral was deterring them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
