Additionally, 480 state-of-the-art LED lights have been installed to enhance broadcast LUX levels.\n\nTwo giant digital replay screens have also been installed at the venue, while a brand-new hospitality enclosure for players and officials is near completion.\n\nMeanwhile, at the National Bank Stadium, significant enhancements have been made including the creation of a new hospitality enclosure for players and officials at the University End, the PCB said.\n\n“To improve broadcast coverage, 350 LED lights have been installed, ensuring optimal visibility for global audiences,” read its press release.\n\n“Two digital replay screens have already been fixed and 5,000 new chairs have been installed to enhance spectator comfort.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
