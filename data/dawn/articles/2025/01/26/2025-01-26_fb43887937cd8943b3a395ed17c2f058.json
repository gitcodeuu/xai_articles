Stakeholders from government, civil society, academia, students, and tech entrepreneurs and UNDP’s digital partner Jazz also attended the event.\n\nMs Durrani said digital technologies were offering Pakistan the fastest path to improve its Human Development Index ranking.\n\nThe report focuses on the fact that in an increasingly interconnected world, the integration of digital technologies has the power to bridge gaps, empower communities, and drive economic growth.\n\nIt furthermore argues that without equitable access to digital technology, Pakistan’s human development outcomes will remain low and under-served.\n\nMr Qureshi said that they would need domain champions and ‘man on the moon’ resolve to achieve Pakistan’s digital transformation while Mr Afzal said NHDR is not just a report, it is hope for Pakistan.\n\nThe launch featured a “Digitalks” session, where prominent speakers, including Punjab Safe City Authority Managing Director Ahsan Younis, Courting the Law CEO Anoosha Shaigan and journalist Munizae Jahangir explored the transformative potential of digital platforms. Topics included leveraging technology for safe cities, human rights, access to justice, and financial inclusion, particularly for vulnerable groups in remote areas.\n\nDiscussions also centered on digitalizing the legal system to democratize justice. Benefits highlighted included increased access to legal information, enhanced efficiency in judicial processes, reduced costs, and improved affordability of justice.\n\n\\However, challenges such as the digital divide, cybersecurity risks, privacy concerns, and resistance to change were identified as critical hurdles to overcome.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
