His legal team pointed out the NAB’s earlier closure of the case in 2020, following the NCA’s settlement agreement, and argued that the reopening of the investigation in 2023 was done in bad faith and for political reasons.\n\nThe appeal also contested the validity of a purported confidentiality deed presented by the prosecution. Mr Khan’s lawyers argued that the document was unverified, with no forensic analysis conducted to determine its authenticity. They further asserted that the document was merely procedural, with no evidence linking it to any criminal activity.\n\nMr Khan’s lawyers emphasised that no personal financial gain had been established. The funds allegedly connected to the case were deposited in the account of Al-Qadir University Trust, a legally registered trust promoting education.\n\n“The prosecution’s own evidence confirms that no donations or monetary benefits were received personally by Imran Khan or his wife,” the appeal said.\n\nThe defence also criticised the trial court for ignoring key evidence and procedural safeguards. “The trial court failed to properly evaluate critical evidence, including testimony from prosecution witnesses and official documents, which directly refute the allegations of misuse of authority,” the appeal read.\n\nMr Khan accused NAB of pursuing a politically motivated agenda, claiming the bureau selectively targeted him while excluding several individuals implicated in the case. “The prosecution deliberately avoided implicating six other key accused individuals, raising serious concerns about the fairness and integrity of the investigation,” his appeal stated.\n\nBushra Bibi, convicted and sentenced to seven years imprisonment in the case, contended that the case against her was politically motivated and unsupported by substantive evidence.\n\nIn her appeal, Bushra Bibi argued that the prosecution failed to establish her alleged role in aiding and abetting her husband or her involvement in the affairs of Al-Qadir University Trust.\n\nThe testimony of the Chief Financial Officer (PW-5), she emphasised, clearly exonerated her, confirming that neither she nor her husband benefited financially from the trust or any related transactions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
