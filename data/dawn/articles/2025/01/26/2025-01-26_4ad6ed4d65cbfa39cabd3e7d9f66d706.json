The assessment included 21,188 communities comprising 42,804 comparable male and female polling stations.\n\nOf the 3,884 communities where women’s choice of winner for National Assembly seats was different, the PTI won more support from women in 1,260 communities (32pc), followed by the PML-N in 1,027 (26pc), and the PPP in 694 (18pc).\n\nAccording to Fafen, regional trends showed that while the PTI performed well across the country in terms of women voters’ choice, the PML-N remained strong in Punjab, winning more votes from women in 895 communities.\n\nIt further stated that the PPP dominated in Sindh, getting more winning ballots from female voters in 413 communities, the majority.\n\nAccording to the analysis, among regions, the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) had the highest proportion (37pc) of electoral communities with different winners in male and female polling stations.\n\nBalochistan reflected a “smaller but notable contrast”, with 68pc of its communities aligned in their winning choices and 32pc differing. It was followed by Sindh (19pc) and Punjab (18pc), while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had the lowest proportion (13pc) of such electoral communities.\n\nThe Fafen analysis also shed light on the significance of women’s choices in determining constituency results.\n\nIn 37 NA constituencies, the largest proportion of voters in female polling stations did not vote for the winning candidates, it highlighted. Meanwhile, in 226 NA constituencies, the largest proportion of voters in female polling stations voted for the constituency winner.\n\nIn seven constituencies — NA-43 Tank-cum-Dera Ismail Khan, NA-49 Attock-I, NA-55 Rawalpindi-IV, NA-87 Khushab-I, NA-94 Chiniot-II, NA-128 Lahore-XII, and NA-163 Bahawalnagar-IV — the lead at female polling stations determined the winner.",
