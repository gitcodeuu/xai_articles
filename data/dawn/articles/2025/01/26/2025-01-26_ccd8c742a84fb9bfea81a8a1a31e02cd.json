The event coincided with Prabowo’s two-day state visit to India, his first to the country since becoming president in 2024.\n\nIndonesia was the guest nation at India’s first Republic Day, Modi said Saturday, adding that it was a matter of “great pride” to have the country part of the parade again.\n\nIndia and Indonesia signed a series of agreements on cooperation on health, maritime security, digital technology with both leaders calling each other “brother”.\n\n“To increase cooperation in the defence sector, we have decided we would work together on defence manufacturing and supply chain,” Modi said in a joint press statement on Saturday.\n\nPrabowo said his administration would send “a high-level defence delegation” soon.\n\nIndia’s arms exports were worth $2.63 billion last year, a tiny amount compared to established players but a 30-fold increase over a decade.\n\nKashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control and the world over are observing India’s Republic Day, as a black day today to protest the persistent denial of their democratic right to self-determination by India, Radio Pakistan reported.\n\nCall for the protest has been given by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (AHPC) and other pro-freedom organisations.\n\nThe day is marked by a complete shutdown in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir, along with anti-India rallies in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan, and key global cities.\n\nThese actions will send a clear message to the international community that India, as the occupier of Kashmiris’ fundamental rights, has no moral or legal standing to celebrate its Republic Day in the territory.\n\nMeanwhile, heightened restrictions in the name of security measures have compounded the already dire conditions faced by the Kashmiris.\n\nIn a message from New Delhi’s notorious Tihar jail, incarcerated APHC Chairman Masarrat Aalam Butt condemned India’s military presence in Jammu and Kashmir as illegal, unconstitutional, and a violation of international law.",
