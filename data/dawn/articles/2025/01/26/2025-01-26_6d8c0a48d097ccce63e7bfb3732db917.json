  "content": "KARACHI/DADU: A large number of people participated in a protest march, organised by the Awami Tehreek (AT) from Gozo to KN Shah against corporate farming and the construction of six new canals projects.\n\nThe march called for the immediate allocation of Sindh’s lands to local, landless farmers rather than to corporate entities.\n\nWomen and children actively participated in the march, which received a warm welcome from villagers along the route.\n\nUpon reaching KN Shah, the march transformed into a massive public gathering, where key leaders delivered fiery speeches and demanded an immediate halt to the land seizures and called on the government to prioritise local farmers by providing them with modern agricultural tools and support to enhance productivity.\n\nThey urged the PPP to adopt a clear stance against these projects, repeal the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) Act’s amendments, and use constitutional forums to oppose the canal construction.\n\nAddressing the gathering, AT leader Noor Ahmed Katiar stated, “A network of new canals has been planned to supply water to corporate farming projects. By constructing these canals, a crisis is being created in Sindh,” he said, and accusing President Asif Zardari of violating the Constitution by “approving” six new canals.\n\nAT general secretary Advocate Sajid Hussain Mahesar criticised the coalition government for forcefully implementing these canals, calling it an attack on Quaid-i-Azam’s vision of Pakistan.\n\nHe revealed that 67,651 acres of land in Kachho had been given to foreign investors under the guise of corporate farming, a move that threatens the livelihood of local farmers and undermines Sindh’s autonomy.\n\nAdvocate Raheel Bhutto condemned the allocation of 10,000 acres of Gorakh Hill to a private firm and said this was not just an attack on Sindh’s lands, but an attack on its culture and heritage.\n\n“If the PPP fails to act, the people of Sindh will hold them accountable in the same way they did with past dictatorial regimes,” they said.\n\nThe march concluded with powerful slogans calling for an end to corporate farming, the cancellation of new canals, and the protection of Sindh’s lands, rivers, and historical cultural heritage.\n\nGDA protest on Feb 9\n\nGrand Democratic Alliance (GDA) leader Liaquat Ali Jatoi announced on Friday that the alliance would hold a protest in Mehar on Feb 9 to raise awareness among people about federal government’s plan for the construction of six canals on Indus River.\n\nMr Jatoi, flanked by other alliance leaders, Sardar Imdad Khan Laghari, Niaz Khan Brohi, and Sardar Ashiq Zaunr, said at a press conference at Dadu Press Club that they would never accept the canals project.\n\nHe warned that the canals would dry up the entire area downstream Guddu Barrage and destroy Sindh’s agriculture. President Asif Ali Zardari’s endorsement of the project was an anti-Sindh move, he said.\n\nHe said that people of Sindh, who were proud of their river must stand united to protect it. “We are ready to fight for its preservation,” said Jatoi, urging public to prepare for the upcoming protests against the canals project.\n\nHe slammed the provincial government for rampant corruption and inefficiency, accusing it of depriving people of Sindh of even basic civic amenities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
