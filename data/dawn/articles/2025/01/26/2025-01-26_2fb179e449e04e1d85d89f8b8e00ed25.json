  "content": "KOHAT: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Secretary Nadeem Aslam Chaudhry on Saturday announced that the government would implement the 14-point Kurram peace agreement in letter and spirit, with no concession granted to anyone.\n\n“We need everyone’s cooperation for the peace accord’s enforcement,” Mr Chaudhry told a joint sitting of jirga and peace committee members and elders from Kurram tribal district at Commissioner’s House here on Saturday.\n\nOn the occasion, Kohat Commissioner Syed Motasim Billah Shah highlighted the measures taken for the restoration of peace in Kurram.\n\nThe chief secretary ordered the demolition of bunkers in the district.\n\nHe said a group from Kurram had submitted its weapon collection plan to authorities, so the other should follow suit without delay.\n\nMr Chaudhry said the government was ready to go to any extent for maintaining law and order in Kurram and therefore, the residents should identify the “cruel and evil” people, for their elimination instead of helping them.\n\nHe promised complete compensation for all damaged properties in Kurram and said a survey for damage assessment had already been completed.\n\nThe chief secretary said in the first phase, authorities had started restoring schools, mosques, offices and banks in Baggan, while repair and reconstruction of houses and markets would get under way soon.\n\n“We are not separate from each other. We are with you, and you are with us, so we have to work together for lasting peace in Kurram,” he told residents.\n\nMr Chaudhry said Kurram residents were treated “inhumanely,” so those responsible for it should seek forgiveness to move forward.\n\nHe declared the jirga a “silent soldier” and appreciated its efforts and support for the restoration of peace in Kurram.\n\nGeneral Officer Commanding of the 9th Division Major General Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti and Kohat commissioner Syed Motasim Billah Shah, former parliamentarians, jirga members and elders also spoke on the occasion.\n\nThe other participants included provincial police chief Akhtar Hayat Khan, Kohat DIG Abbas Majeed Marwat, Kurram deputy commissioner Mohammad Ashfaq, Kohat deputy commissioner Abdul Akram, and other relevant officers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
