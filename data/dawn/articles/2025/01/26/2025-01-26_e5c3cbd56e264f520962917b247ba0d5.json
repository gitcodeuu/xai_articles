  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan government has finalised a broader framework to generate 215,000 job opportunities in the province.\n\nThis decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan here on Friday.\n\nMr Khan told the meeting that Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had promised to provide jobs and employment opportunities to the province’s youth. However, it was also highlighted that the government lacks the resources to provide employment for every unemployed individual in the province.\n\nIt was noted that economies thrive and grow through the strength of the private sector. Targets were set for various sectors to create job opportunities through diverse strategies and plans, the meeting was told.\n\nA target of at least 215,000 job opportunities was agreed upon for the investment proposals in the upcoming year. The meeting was informed that the chief minister and his government had already laid out the vision and policy, and it’s now up to the civil servants to bring this vision to reality.\n\nIt was hoped that these programmes will help guide the youth towards healthy vocations and have a positive impact on the overall situation in the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
