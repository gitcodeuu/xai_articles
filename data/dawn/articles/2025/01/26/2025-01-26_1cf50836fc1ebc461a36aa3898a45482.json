  "content": "KARACHI: Asad Zaman mounted a remarkable comeback against Mohammad Salar in a final marred by umpiring errors to seize the Under-18 juniors title in the Ghazi & Magsi National Junior and Senior Tennis Championship which concluded here at Modern club on Saturday.\n\nSalar claimed the first set 6-4 in a contest plagued by various officiating problems, marked by the absence of line umpires in the first set, several dubious calls by the chair umpire, and multiple score-keeping errors. Both the players expressed their frustration and explicitly criticised the standard of umpiring.\n\n“The umpire wasn’t certified, and he wasn’t suitable for this level,” Salar said. “He made 10 to 12 wrong calls, and that’s all it takes to lose a match.”\n\nAsad echoed the concerns but remained diplomatic.\n\n“This happens in matches like these, but not to this extent,” he said. “Three or four wrong calls can change the outcome of a game. However, the umpire was trying his best”\n\nDespite the rocky start, Asad roared back in the second set, dictating play with aggressive returns and smart court positioning. Breaking Salar’s serves and cruising to a commanding 6-2 win. His precision and confidence visibly rattled Salar, whose earlier composure began to waver as unforced errors crept into his game.\n\nHowever, Salar opened the third set with dominance, surging to a 4-0 lead with powerful serves and aggressive shots. Just when it seemed like Salar had control, Asad mounted a stunning comeback, finding his rhythm and exploiting Salar’s forehand. With six consecutive games win, Asad turned the tide in his favour to seal the match 6-4.\n\n“I had cramps in my hands during the third set,” Zaman said. “I came into this tournament to enjoy as I knew my fitness isn’t where it should be, but I managed to win. I need to work on my stamina and spend more time in the gym.”\n\nSalar admitted there were gaps in his game but maintained a positive outlook. “It’s part of the game, and it happens,” he said. “There are many weaknesses in my game, and I need to work on them.”\n\nIn the girls U-18 singles, Romesa Malik capped off a remarkable week by winning the title with a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Eschelle Asif. Romesa’s triumph in the U-18 final came just a day after she claimed the U-14 singles title.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
