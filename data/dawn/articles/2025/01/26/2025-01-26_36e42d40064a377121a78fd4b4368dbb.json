  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The much-awaited possession of plots in Sector I-12 remains an elusive dream for hundreds of allottees, particularly middle-class families, who are growing increasingly frustrated by the Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) failure to deliver on its promises.\n\nIn May 2024, CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa directed the CDA authorities to complete the development of Sector I-12 within four months. However, the deadline passed in September 2024, and plots are still not handed over to their owners.\n\nThe CDA’s failure to meet its own deadline has sparked criticism from the allottees, particularly those from the middle class, including retired and in-service government employees, who have been waiting for years to secure their future homes.\n\nMiddle-class allottees, many of whom have been living in rented accommodations for years, are particularly impacted. For them, owning a plot in Sector I-12 was supposed to be a step toward securing permanent housing. Unfortunately, the continuous delays have caused widespread dissatisfaction.\n\nPlot owners criticise civic body for launching new projects instead of finishing existing schemes\n\nTahir Mahmood, a plot allottee, said, “Many allottees had pinned their hopes on the plots as a means to secure affordable housing in the federal capital, but the CDA’s inability to meet its own deadlines has left them disheartened.” He expressed his frustration, accusing the CDA of focusing on new housing schemes, like Margalla Enclave, instead of prioritising the development of existing sectors.\n\n“The CDA should have handed over plots to the old allottees first, but instead, they are introducing new sectors to collect money from the public. This delay is a serious setback for middle-class families like me,” he stated.\n\nKhumar Gul, another allottee, criticised the CDA’s allocation of funds, noting that new projects seemed to receive more attention and funding, while development in residential sectors like I-12, which cater to middle-class people, lagged. “I am a retired professor living in a rented house and paying a steep rent. The CDA should immediately give me possession of my plot so that I can build my home there,” he urged.\n\nMr Atif, another allottee, shared his anxiety about the situation, stating, “The delay in possession has left me stressed. I am paying high rent because I am forced to live in a rented house.”\n\nThe allottees of Sector I-12 urged the CDA chairman to address the sluggish pace of development in the sector and expedite the process to fulfill the long-overdue promises made to them. They stressed the importance of prioritising the completion of Sector I-12, rather than diverting resources to new projects, and called on the CDA to take immediate action to bring the development work to a swift conclusion.\n\nSerena Interchange project\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa, along with Member Engineering Syed Nafasat Raza and relevant officers, visited the Serena Interchange project and took a detailed review of the ongoing construction activities of the project.\n\nDuring the briefing, the relevant officers said that the construction work was progressing on all sections as per the schedule, and the finishing work of the underpasses on Srinagar Highway was progressing rapidly. It was also informed that the asphalt work on the connecting and slip roads related to the project was underway at a fast pace.\n\nMr Randhawa directed that the work on the underpasses of Srinagar Highway be completed and opened for traffic during this month. He instructed that the beautification and horticulture work around the project be completed as soon as possible.\n\nHe emphasised that the highest standards of construction work must be ensured under all circumstances. He stated that consultants and resident engineers must ensure the swift completion of construction work along with maintaining the highest quality.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2025",
