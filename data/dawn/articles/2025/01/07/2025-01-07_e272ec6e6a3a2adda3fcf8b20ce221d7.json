The last Pakistani to win the British Junior Open crown was Nasir Iqbal in 2007.\n\nThe 12-year-old Sohail battled through a challenging draw against top players from around the world. His final match showcased not only his technical brilliance but also mental fortitude, as he fought back after trailing in the third game to secure a historic win.\n\nIn the pre-quarterfinal, Sohail defeated Malaysia’s Wain Isaac Wilson 11-4, 11-7, 11-5.
