After this, PIA has also resumed its services to Europe and the United Kingdom.\n\nAs part of its fleet rejuvenation efforts, PIA is working on bringing back aircraft that had been grounded for extended periods. Recently, an ATR aircraft, which had been in long-term storage, was reintroduced to service. With the addition of this ATR, PIA has strengthened its domestic operations, particularly on routes to Gilgit, Sukkur, Turbat and Gwadar.\n\nThe PIA management is focused on ensuring punctuality, with an on-time performance target set at 90 per cent, the spokesperson said, adding that the airline is currently meeting this target consistently on a daily basis.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2025",
