It’s a trophy we’re really proud to hold so we want to go back and defend it.\n\n“I think it’s a great tournament in that you’ve got to play well consistently and across all different conditions against different teams.\n\n“We can’t wait to get over there.”\n\nSouth Africa booked their spot under the WTC’s average points system when they beat Pakistan in a dramatic two-wicket win at Centurion late last month.\n\nAustralia play two Tests in Sri Lanka starting later this month before a lengthy red-ball break heading into the WTC final.\n\nCummins appears likely to miss the Sri Lanka tour for the birth of his second child, with Steve Smith in pole position to take over as captain.\n\nBut the Australian skipper is adamant that after four year in the role, he has no plans to hand over the armband permanently anytime soon.\n\n“First of all, I absolutely love what I do. That’s the biggest driver in wanting to play Test cricket and work with this team and support staff,” Cummins said.\n\n“I absolutely love everything about it, it’s that much fun. If I can keep doing it for a while, even better.”\n\nCricket Australia meanwhile said nearly 838,000 spectators attended the Border-Gavaskar Trophy series, despite two matches ending within three days.\n\nThe numbers were boosted by the Boxing Day Test in Melbourne going all five days, with a record 373,691 people turning out across the match.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2025",
