Wild elephants have killed 227 people, including tourists, in the past 12 years, according to the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.\n\nAn elephant killed a 49-year-old woman at a national park in Loei province in northern Thailand last month. While encounters between villagers and wild elephants are common, attacks at sanctuaries remain rare.\n\nBathing elephants is a popular activity among visitors in Thailand, where about 2,800 elephants are held for tourism purposes across the country, according to World Animal Protection.\n\nHowever, animal rights groups argue that bathing elephants can cause them distress and some sanctuaries in the country do not allow it.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2025",
