Millions await the connectivity, education, and opportunities Starlink could offer. Please, expedite Starlink’s launch in Pakistan,” the user said.\n\nMusk’s confirmation of his intention to launch Starlink in Pakistan comes at a time when the nation topped the list of countries that suffered the most due to internet outages in 2024.\n\nAccording to Top10VPN.com, an independent VPN reviewer, the global internet disruption lasted 88,788 hours last year which caused a financial loss of $7.69 billion.\n\nIt said Pakistan was the single most affected nation with $1.62bn in losses, followed by Myanmar ($1.58bn) and Sudan ($1.12bn).",
