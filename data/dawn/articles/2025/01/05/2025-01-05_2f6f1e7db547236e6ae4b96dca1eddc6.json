  "content": "KARACHI: While already struggling under high food inflation and utility bills, consumers face another challenging experience of paying exorbitant prices for dried fruits in which high-quality pine nut (chilgoza) takes the lead with a price tag ranging between Rs12,000-14,000 per kg.\n\nDealers in the Saddar area recalled that good quality pine nuts were selling at Rs15,000-16,000 per kg a year back, Rs5,200 in 2022 and Rs8,000 in 2021, respectively.\n\n“For all income strata people, pine nuts are now unaffordable,” they said, adding that some people buy in thin quantities.\n\nAnother shock for the masses is the abnormally high price of Parachinar peanut, now retailed at Rs1,200 per kg by push carts and roadside stall owners. A year back, it was priced at Rs1,000 per kg in retail markets and Rs720 in 2021.\n\nImports soar 122pc in dollar terms\n\nDespite road blockades and tension in Parachinar in recent weeks, the arrival of peanuts continued uninterrupted in Karachi. A trader said many dealers had already procured huge stocks before the eruption of violence.\n\n“Due to high prices, peanuts have gone out of range for many people, as some people feel satisfied buying only 125 grams for Rs150,” he said, adding that a low- and middle-income family with two to three kids takes away only 250 grams.\n\nGood quality American almond (Baadam) is pegged at last year’s Rs2,800-3,000 per kg. In 2021, almonds were selling at Rs2,000 per kg.\n\nHigh-quality Indian cashew nut (Kajoo) now sells at Rs5,200 compared to Rs 4,800 per kg last year. In 2021, it was available at Rs2,200 per kg.\n\nTraders said only cashew nut rates have increased from last year.\n\nWalnuts with and without shells are sold at Rs2,400-3,000 and Rs1,000-1,200 per kg, showing no change from last year. In 2021, retailers charged Rs1,400-1,600 and Rs600-800 per kg for walnuts without and with shells, respectively.\n\nSalted Iranian pistachio is available at Rs2,800-3,000 per kg, almost the same as last year.\n\nWith no official or private yardsticks to quantify costly dried fruit sales volumes, some retailers claim a 30 per cent increase in demand despite higher prices.\n\nThe claim holds weight owing to a massive increase of 83pc in quantity and 122pc in value in dried fruits and nuts imports during 5MFY25. As per data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, imports of dried fruits and nuts swelled to 84,573 tonnes ($66.2m) in 5MFY25 versus 46,278 tonnes ($30m) in the same period last year.\n\nDried fruits are also heavily used to prepare different dishes, mainly halwa and sweetmeats, and the demand for these items usually surges on the eve of any Islamic festivals like Eidul Fitr and Rabi-ul-Awal, etc.\n\nRetailers said that stability in rupee-dollar parity in 2024 kept imported food prices under control.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 5th, 2025",
