The said person continuously remained in touch with him for 10-15 days but he was avoiding him.\n\nSubsequently, he (Hamid) approached his friend Zohaib and later on at night on Dec 24, three people came to his office in Saima Arabian Villas.\n\nTwo of them identified themselves as Muzamil and Hammad.\n\nThe complainant said he told them he would ask his friend to arrange dollars as he did not have the currency.\n\nThey made a video of a dollar whose picture was in his cell phone and sent it to someone.\n\nAs per the FIR, the suspects asked for 30,000 dollars and when he demanded payment for such a quantity of foreign currency, the said suspects did not give him any positive response and stayed there for 45 minutes.\n\nThey told him that a person namely Ashar would come and make the payment to him. In the meantime, they all went to a restaurant in the area where at around 1am on Dec 25, three people in a Suzuki Alto vehicle also arrived, who identified themselves as Ashar, Muzamil and Zaman.\n\nThe complainant said when he asked Ashar for the payment, he also avoided and went for a while where he made a phone call to someone.\n\nSubsequently, at 1:40am one police mobile, without number plate, arrived in which there were five people in plain clothes.
