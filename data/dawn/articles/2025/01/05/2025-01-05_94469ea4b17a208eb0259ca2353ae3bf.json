A few flames and trails of smoke continued to rise from burning furniture in the ruins hours after the attack.\n\nStrike on a house in Gaza City killed five people later on Saturday, the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said, adding that at least 10 others were feared trapped under the rubble.\n\nAt least six other Palestinians were killed in Israeli strikes in Jabalia in the north and near the central town of Deir Al-Balah, medics said. Saturday’s deaths brought the toll to 70 since Friday, health officials said.\n\nUS arms sale to Israel\n\nMeanwhile, the administration of US President Joe Biden has notified Congress of a planned $8 billion arms sale to Israel, a source familiar with the plan said on Saturday.\n\nThe State Department “has informally notified Congress of an $8 billion proposed sale of munitions to support Israel’s long-term security by resupplying stocks of critical munitions and air defence capabilities,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nweapons package includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to defend against aerial threats; Hellfire AGM-114 missiles; 155mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting; and 500-pound warheads, the official said.\n\nThe Biden administration has provided Israel with billions in arms aid since Israeli forces launched a massive attack on Gaza. The outgoing US president has repeatedly vowed “ironclad” support for Israel.\n\nRenewed ceasefire push\n\nA surge in Israeli operations and the number of Palestinians killed in recent days comes amid a renewed push to reach a ceasefire in the war and return Israeli prisoners before US President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan 20.\n\nIsraeli mediators were dispatched to resume talks in Doha brokered by Qatari and Egyptian mediators, and US President Joe Biden’s administration, which is helping to broker the talks, urged Hamas on Friday to agree to a deal.\n\nHamas said it was committed to reaching an agreement but it was unclear how close the two sides were.\n\nThe armed group released a video on Saturday showing Israeli prisoner Liri Albag — who local media said was a soldier — urging Israel to do more to secure the prisoners’ release.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 5th, 2025",
