  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Many localities in the garrison city are without water after Islamabad Electric Supply Company (Iesco) disconnected power supply to nine tubewells for non-payment of outstanding dues amounting to Rs1.8 billion by Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa).\n\nWasa officials said areas between Chandni Chowk and Shamsabad were provided water from tubewells and after disconnection of power by Iesco on Thursday evening, supply of water to the consumers had been halted.\n\nThe officials said Wasa paid Rs60 million on Friday, but Iesco did not restore the electricity supply.\n\nThey said disconnection of electricity to a public amenity was not justified, adding instead of issuing notices Iesco disconnected electricity supply to the tubewells, creating water shortage in the areas.\n\nWasa chief admits Rs1.8bn dues pending for 18 months; says usually such amount paid by Punjab govt\n\nIesco spokesman Raja Asim could not be contacted for comments. However, other officials of the company said electricity to the tubewells was disconnected after Wasa failed to clear the dues despite repeated notices.\n\nWasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf told Dawn that Iesco disconnected electricity to nine tubewells along Murree Road. He said his staff met Iesco officials and submitted Rs60 million on Friday with a request to restore electricity to the tubewells so water supply to the residents could be restored.\n\n“Areas on the right side of Murree Road are provided water from Khanpur Dam, but the supply from the dam is not sufficient to also meet the requirement of areas on the left side of Murree Road. So these areas are supplied water from tubewells. The disconnection of electricity to the tubewells has created problems for Wasa as well as the consumers,” he said.\n\nHe admitted that Iesco’s outstanding amount of Rs1.8 billion had been pending for the last 18 months.\n\nHowever, he added, usually such an amount was paid by the Punjab government at the end of each fiscal year. He said it had been a practice for many years that the provincial government settled outstanding dues with the electricity supplying companies. But this year, Iesco disconnected electricity to tubewells instead of issuing notices or writing a letter to the government for clearing the dues.\n\nHe said it was the responsibility of both the civic bodies to sit together and clear the outstanding amount instead of creating problems for the consumers. He said Wasa was ready to clear its outstanding amount.\n\n“We are paying our electricity bills regularly despite there being no subsidy for tubewells, and Iesco charges commercial tariff for the facility being provided to residents,” he said.\n\nMr Ashraf said Wasa had written a letter to the Punjab government for the provision of Rs2.5 billion to pay the electricity bills of tubewells in the city and its share in the Sangjani filtration plant of Khanpur Dam. He said the government provided such an amount to Wasa Lahore, Gujranwala and Multan. However, Wasa Rawalpindi is yet to receive a response.\n\nHe said if the government abolishes the subsidy on water and sewerage charges of five-marla houses, we would be able to collect bills and clear all dues of electricity without any help from the provincial government.\n\nOn the other hand, the residents of Data Gunj Bukhsh Road, Dhoke Paracha, Shamsabad and adjoining areas faced water shortage.\n\nMohammad Ansar, a resident of Dhoke Paracha, said they were without water and had to fetch drinking water from Double Road.\n\n“The entire area is facing water shortage and people have to buy water from tankers,” said Mohammad Safdar, a resident of Data Gunj Bukhsh Road.\n\nShafqat Abbasi, another resident, said Wasa officials had told residents the outstanding bill had been paid to Iesco, but power was yet to be restored to tubewells.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 11th, 2025",
