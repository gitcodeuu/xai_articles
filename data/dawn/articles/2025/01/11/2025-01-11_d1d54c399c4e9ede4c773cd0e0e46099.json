He explained that additional charges could be added during investigations and noted that the Supreme Court had previously allowed military court convictions to be challenged in superior courts.\n\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail observed that while interpreting laws, the intention of the top judiciary should always be to benefit citizens. However, the counsel explained that the benefit of the citizens was always connected with the benefit of the state and not to a small segment of people who undermine the security and interest of the state.\n\n“It is a settled principle of law that instead of striking down a law under challenge, the priority of the courts should always be to remove conflict, if any, by saving the legal instrument,” the counsel said.\n\nJustice Mandokhail regretted that the apex court could not go into merits; rather, the judiciary would be helpless if the military courts, while ignoring the requirements of the criminal justice system, awarded a death sentence to an accused civilian based on false or lack of evidence.\n\n“We need to tread carefully while deciding the present matter in a way that shrinks the jurisdiction of the military courts so that it should apply to fewer and fewer civilians,” Justice Mandokhail emphasised.\n\nThe counsel, however, replied that courts could intervene if the assumption of the jurisdiction by the military courts was based on mala fide (in bad faith) or coram non judice (not before a judge) and without any legal authority.\n\nReferring to the 2016 Said Zaman Khan case, the counsel explained that the Supreme Court had held that any conviction by the military courts could be challenged before the superior judiciary, adding that the decision also highlighted that some rights could not be made available to the accused facing trials in the military courts.\n\nThe counsel argued that military court jurisdiction applied only to cases directly impacting national security under Section 2(1d) (i and ii) of the PAA. He clarified that offences like hijacking fall under ATA and not PAA, citing a past plane hijacking case where the Supreme Court ruled that passengers’ lives were not at risk.\n\nJustice Hilali raised concerns about military court procedures, noting that presiding officers do not announce judgements themselves, leaving decisions to commanding officers. “How can an officer who had not heard the matter could hand over the judgement?” Justice Hilali questioned.\n\nShe pointed to the tense security situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where cases of attacks on army personnel were not sent to military courts.\n\nJustice Muhammad Ali Mazhar observed that military courts worldwide conduct trials with only military officers presiding. The counsel explained that those military officers had experience in conducting trials.\n\nJustice Naeem Akhtar Afghan observed that there was a general perception that the trial in the military court was only to the extent of punishment, stressing that it would have been appropriate if the stages of the trial in the military courts were explained. He recalled that he had heard such cases in the Balochistan High Court and knew that the facility of engaging a lawyer of choice was available in court martial.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 11th, 2025",
