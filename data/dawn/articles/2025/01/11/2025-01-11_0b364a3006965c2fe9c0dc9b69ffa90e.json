These workers were kidnapped a day earlier.\n\nThe deadline was given at a meeting held at a school ground in the Dallokhel area near Lakki Marwat city. Elders from Aba Shaheedkhel and Begukhel tribes also attended the meeting.\n\nThe jirga was held against the backdrop of the abduction of 16 private workers and their driver from Lakki-Darra Tang road by armed militants. The kidnappers had taken them to an unknown location. They set on fire their coach in a forested area along Kurrum River.\n\nAfter the incident, security forces and police launched a rescue operation and recovered eight of the kidnap victims.\n\nThe jirga condemned the incident and termed it the government’s failure, asking the authorities to take steps for the safe recovery of the kidnapped workers. “We have gathered on a single point agenda to share the locals’ concerns with the government…[and to] secure safe release of all [the] remaining kidnapped employees,” an elder said.\n\nHe claimed that the kidnapped men were affiliated with a public sector organisation which should join the Marwat elders in their efforts to secure their safe release.\n\nSome elders proposed to form a committee to hold a meeting with the district administration to pave the way for the recovery of workers.\n\nNaseer Turab, an elder, said that the jirga had set a 24-hour deadline for the government to free the kidnap victims, adding that they would chalk out a future line of action in the next meeting if the workers did not return.\n\nThe elders expressed deep concern over the deteriorating law and order situation and regretted that the abduction incidents were taking place in broad daylight. They said that local residents would have to take steps for their protection since the law enforcement agencies had failed to protect them.\n\nFormer MNA Amirullah Marwat, MPA Johar Muhammad Khan, engineer Lat­if­ullah Khan of the Awami National Party, Inayatur Rehman of Aba Shaheedkhel jirga and Naser Turab spoke on the occasion.\n\nFormer tehsil nazims Faridullah Khan and Haji Hidayatullah Khan, former district councilors Fawad Ahmad Khan, Irf­an­ullah Khan and Hanifullah and other elders were also present at the meeting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 11th, 2025",
