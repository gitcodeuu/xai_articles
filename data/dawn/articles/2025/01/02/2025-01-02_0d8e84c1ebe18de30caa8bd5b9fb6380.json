They abducted his brother, took him to an unknown location, and informed the complainant that his brother would be released after resolving the dispute.\n\nIn the detailed order, the court reproduced the detailed testimony of the abductee to understand the sequence of events.\n\nIn his testimony, the complainant stated that he had established a construction company in 2004 and gave a five per cent share to his employee, Nawazish.\n\nHe claimed that upon his return to the country the following year, an audit revealed financial misappropriation by Nawazish and another employee Naveed. Both the accused allegedly submitted written declarations acknowledging their actions and apologising for the embezzlement.\n\nHowever, he further alleged that months later, these two employees conspired against him and led to his arrest in the Rs5m cheque dishonour case.\n\nDuring his judicial remand, he claimed that the accused took over his office premises “illegally”. Subsequently, he terminated the services of both Nawazish and Naveed over allegations of fraud.\n\nDescribing his six-month in captivity, the victim alleged that the accused confined him to a room where co-accused Haji Zaman and Aamir, said to be associated with Taliban, attempted to make him a suicide bomber.\n\nDuring this period, he stated that Nawazish frequently visited the place. He later discovered that Nawazish had transferred 95pc of the company’s shares to Haji Zaman and sold assets worth Rs20m.\n\nHe further claimed that after his release on medical grounds, he filed petitions in the Sindh High Court in 2008 and 2014, seeking the arrest of the accused and recovery of his assets.\n\nAfter filing petitions in the court, he claimed that he was taken into custody where he was forced to sign the alleged agreement with a business group.\n\nWhile submitting the agreement in court, the victim claimed he was compelled to pay Rs1m per month to continue developing the project.\n\nAccording to his statement, he ultimately sold the project for Rs500m, though its actual value was Rs18 billion.\n\nThe court noted that both accused persons did not deny the declarations, adding that prima facie “they have committed misappropriation/fraud of Rs7,000,000, which they have to return to the abductee, so their conduct itself proves that they were involved in the fraud or cheating in his company.”\n\nRegarding the delay in submission of the challan, the court observed: “The involvement of influential individuals, notably the accused Nawazish Akbar, a retired Major, contributed to the delay, further evidenced by the prolonged delay of 17-18 years in submitting the challan.”\n\nIt further noted that the victim had provided details of being “pressured, threatened, and blackmailed into signing business agreements and transferring assets under duress. His testimony was supported by over 700 pages of documentary evidence, which detailed the extent of the financial exploitation he endured”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 2nd, 2025",
