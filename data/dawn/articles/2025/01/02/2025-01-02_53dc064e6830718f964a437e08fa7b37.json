The remaining have been presumed dead.\n\nIn response to the tragedy, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered the authorities to take action against human smugglers and officials aiding them.\n\nSince then, a countrywide crackdown has been launched against human smugglers, leading to the arrests of over a dozen suspects.\n\nAccording to the FIA, criminal cases have been filed against 13 agency officials for their alleged involvement in human trafficking.\n\nFIA Director General Ahmed Ishaq Jahangir conducted departmental hearings of 49 officials implicated in boat incidents, the agency said, adding that 35 were dismissed from service.\n\nThese officers included four inspectors, 10 sub-inspectors, two ASIs, five head constables and 14 constables.\n\n“The purpose of departmental accountability is to rid the organisation of corrupt elements,” the FIA DG was quoted as saying.\n\nMr Jahangir added that strict measures were being taken against FIA officials involved in illegal activities.\n\nMore arrests\n\nThe FIA has claimed to have arrested four more alleged human smugglers, including a wanted criminal.\n\nThe suspects included Imran Hussain alias Mani, who was wanted for allegedly sending abroad migrants who died in a boat tragedy near Libya in 2023. He was listed in the agency’s Red Book’s “most wanted” category.\n\nOther suspects were identified as Muhammad Ijaz, Imran Saqib and Rizwan Khadim, an FIA spokesperson said.\n\nThe arrests were made from various areas of Gujranwala and Gujrat.\n\nThe FIA spokesperson claimed Hussain was a member of an international human trafficking gang and was named in six cases registered in Gujrat.\n\nHe allegedly extorted Rs2.4 million from each of the six victims of the Libya boat incident.\n\nThe victims were sent from Pakistan to Egypt and Dubai on visit visas and later to Libya, where they were kept in safe houses. Later, they were placed on the Europe-bound boat, which capsized.\n\nThe FIA Gujranwala zone has so far registered 32 cases and launched two inquiries against human traffickers.\n\nAnd 10 suspects involved in the Greek boat accident have been arrested while a crackdown was underway to arrest their accomplices, FIA said.\n\nBodies recovered\n\nThe bodies of four more Pakistanis who died in last month’s boat tragedy have been recovered, taking the total death toll to nine.\n\nThe victims have been identified as Shabbir, Zain Ali and Zeeshan of Narowal and Awais Ali of Sialkot.\n\nThe bodies of three of the five Pakistanis earlier recovered from the sea have already been airlifted to Pakistan, while the remaining two will be transported on Thursday.\n\nThe deceased were identified as Haji Ahmed from Mandi Bahau­d­din, Muhammad Sufyan from Sialkot, Rehman Ali from Guj­rat, Muhammad Abid and Muhammad Abdullah.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 2nd, 2025",
