His recent decision to commute the sentences of 37 of the 40 federal death row inmates triggered the wrath of his Republican adversary.\n\nIn response, Trump has vowed to seek to have even more defendants sentenced to death.\n\n“Biden is scared by what he fears President Trump may do,” said Rowland. “That fear is making him especially forceful in trying to limit the agenda of the incoming Trump Administration and to solidify his administration’s accomplishments,” he said.\n\nThe outgoing president had previously granted 39 presidential pardons and commuted sentences for nearly 1,500 people, with the White House hailing it as “the largest single-day grant of clemency in modern history”.\n\n“All presidents use their power to pardon or commute sentences at the end of their presidencies,” Wendy Schiller, a Brown University political science professor, told AFP.\n\nZelizer said the judicial actions may be motivated by Biden seeking to “honour some of the promises he made during his campaign on criminal justice.” One of his most notable decisions, however, was to pardon his son, Hunter Biden, who he said had been subjected to unfair treatment by the courts and prosecutors.\n\nThe move provoked strong criticism from Trump and Republicans, but also from close Democratic allies.\n\nRowland said the pardon has “definitely had a major negative impact” on Biden’s reputation, adding impetus to his final days’ work to shape public opinion of his outgoing administration.\n\nDebt, Ukraine and courts\n\nAnother one of Biden’s pledges was to take action on student debt owed by millions of Americans. Days before Christmas, the outgoing president announced student debt cancellation for 55,000 public service workers.\n\nThat brought “the total number of individuals who have been approved for student debt relief under my Administration to nearly five million people through various actions,” Biden said.\n\nFor Rowland, “the most striking decision” by Biden in his final days has been the “effort to get as much aid to Ukraine as possible before Trump becomes president.”\n\nIn December, Washington anno­unced four new shipments of military equipment to Kyiv, worth several billion dollars, to aid in the country’s fight against Russia’s invasion.\n\nWhile it is still uncertain what Trump’s policy will be toward Ukraine once he is in the Oval Office, the Republican has voiced strong opposition to US missiles being fired into Russia, which Biden approved after the election.\n\nBiden also recently increased US commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Trump, a noted climate change skeptic, may attempt to walk those back, with a friendly Congress at his side.\n\nThe White House and Democrats in the Senate — which is set to flip to Republican control, along with the House of Representatives — have been working to quickly confirm as many judges as possible.\n\nBiden has made appointing diverse candidates to the federal bench a priority, including by naming the first Black woman to the Supreme Court, Ketanji Brown Jackson, during his term.\n\nIn all, at least 235 federal judges have been confirmed by the Senate during Biden’s four years in office, a record for a single term since the Jimmy Carter administration, the White House boasts.\n\nAs Democratic-aligned groups aim to stymie the Trump agenda through the courts, Biden-appointed judges may help temporarily, though key issues may ultimately end up in the Supreme Court, where conservatives have a broad 6-3 majority.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 2nd, 2025",
