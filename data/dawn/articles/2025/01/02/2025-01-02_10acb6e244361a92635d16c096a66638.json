Its fighters repeatedly defeated both countries’ armies and carried out or inspired attacks in dozens of cities around the world.\n\nIts then leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, killed in 2019 by US special forces in northwestern Syria, rose from obscurity to lead the ultra-hardline group and declare himself “caliph” of all Muslims.\n\nThe caliphate collapsed in Iraq, where it once had a base only a 30-minute drive from Baghdad, and in Syria, after a sustained military campaign by a US-led coalition.\n\nThe new leader, known by the pseudonym Abu Hafs al-Hashimi al-Quraishi, remains shrouded in secrecy.\n\nIS has switched tactics since the collapse of its forces and a string of other setbacks in the Middle East.\n\nOnce based in the Syrian city of Raqqa and the Iraqi city of Mosul, from which it sought to rule like a centralised government, the group took refuge in the hinterlands of the two fractured countries. Its fighters are scattered in autonomous cells, its leadership is clandestine and its overall size is hard to quantify. The UN estimates it at 10,000 in its heartlands.\n\nThe movement went underground with sleeper cells that launch hit-and-run attacks, according to an Iraqi government security adviser who helps track IS.\n\nAll key foreign fighters fled Iraq for countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and Pakistan. Most have joined Islamic State’s Khorasan branch (ISIS-K), named after an old term for the region that included parts of Iran, Turkmenistan and Afghanistan.\n\nIt is active along Iran’s borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\nSanaullah Ghafari, the 29-year-old leader of the Afghan branch of IS, has overseen its transformation into one of the most fearsome branches of the global Islamist network, capable of operations far from its bases in the borderlands of Afghanistan.\n\nIslamic State — often called ISIS, ISIL, or the pejorative Daesh — has also made its mark in parts of Africa.\n\nIn Uganda, militants from IS-connected rebel Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), staged a series of attacks including a massacre at a boarding school, the murder of a honeymooning couple and a raid on a village that killed at least three people.\n\nThe group, which started as an uprising in Uganda, has largely moved its operations to the neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo where it has staged multiple attacks.\n\nSeveral other groups have pledged allegiance to IS in West Africa and across the Sahel. Affiliates have control of large areas of rural Mali, Niger and northern Burkina Faso and into North Africa.\n\nIn January 2023, the US military carried out an operation that killed a senior IS leader in northern Somalia. The UN fears militant groups could exploit the political instability in Sudan, which is gripped by a civil war.\n\nThe US National Counterterrorism Centre has said the threat posed by IS and another militant group al Qaeda “is at a low point with the suppression of the most dangerous elements”.\n\nBut it went on to warn that half of IS’s branches are now active in insurgencies across Africa and “may be poised for further expansion”.\n\nIt said the group had lost three overall leaders and at least 13 other senior operatives in Iraq and Syria since early 2022 “contributing to a loss of expertise and a decline in ISIS attacks in the Middle East”.",
