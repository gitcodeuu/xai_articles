He requested the LHC to set aside the sentence and allow the appeal.\n\nThere were three FIRs registered against Haseem. He was acquitted in one case in 2023 while another case was referred back to the trial court for rehearing by the LHC.\n\nGanda Singhwala police of Kasur had registered at least 29 FIRs against dozens of suspects on charges of abducting and sexually assaulting around 280 children of the same district.\n\nThe prosecution charged the accused persons of sexually assaulting young boys and filming the incidents to blackmail them.\n\nSeveral accused persons were later acquitted by the trial court for lack of evidence.\n\nPUNJAB COLLEGE: An antiterrorism court extended the judicial remand of a woman TikToker who claimed to be the mother of the alleged ‘rape victim’ of the Punjab College.\n\nGulberg police presented the suspect woman, Sara Khan, before the court on expiry of her 14-day judicial remand.\n\nThe investigating officer stated before the court that one out of two mobile phones of the suspect had been recovered from Multan. He said the charge sheet was in its final stage and would be filed soon.\n\nATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill extended the judicial remand of the suspect till Jan 10 and directed police to ensure submission of the challan at the next hearing.\n\nPolice alleged that the suspect recorded a video, claiming that she was the mother of an alleged rape victim and uploaded it on her TikTok handle. It said the video went viral and added to the controversy over the alleged rape case.\n\nThe suspect, a resident of Karachi with a permanent address in Multan, had been charged with making a false claim, inciting public sentiment against the government authorities and urging the people to violence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 3rd, 2025",
