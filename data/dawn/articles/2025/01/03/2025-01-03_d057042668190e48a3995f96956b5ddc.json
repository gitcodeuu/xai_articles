The SEA-ME-WE 4 and IMEWE cables have landing stations at Hawksbay beach, while the AAE-1 lands at Clifton beach, close to Captain Farhan Ali Shaheed Park.\n\nThe other two companies operating internet cables in Pakistan are TransWorld Associates (TWA) and the Cyber Internet Services Ltd\n\nThe TWA operates SEA-ME-WE 5 as well as regional cable TWA-1 from Karachi to UAE and Oman, connecting internet traffic from Pakistan with international hubs in Gulf countries.\n\nThe Cyber Internet Services Ltd operates ‘PEACE’ cable originating from China. The cable goes on land to Misri Shah in DHA Karachi, from where it enters the sea to Europe.\n\nThe total capacity of the six internet cables is around 13 terabits per second (tbps), and the consumption is between 7 and 8tbps.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 3rd, 2025",
