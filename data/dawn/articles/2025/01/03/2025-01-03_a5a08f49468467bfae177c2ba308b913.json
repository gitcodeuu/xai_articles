I have also put the demand before the PM that any development work carried out in the city should be executed through the local government while taking the Karachi administration on board.”\n\nHe was of the view that to put an end to hypocrisy, it was essential to deliver good deeds and make them visible to the public. Reflecting on the progress of the past one and a half years, he affirmed that significant improvements had already been made, with more to come.\n\n“The journey has just begun,” he said. “We will continue to highlight the development work undertaken by Bilawal Bhutto as all of us are united in achieving his vision for Karachi.”\n\nThe mayor also urged all political parties, including the Pak­istan Tehreeki-Insaf, Muttahida Qaumi Movement Pakistan, Jamaat-i-Islami, and Pakistan Muslim League-N, to collaborate for the betterment of the city, saying: “Our collective efforts will transform Karachi into a city we can all be proud of.”\n\nAddressing the recent infrastructure improvements, Mayor Wahab highlighted the restoration of nine pumping stations in Lyari, along with ongoing efforts to beautify the surrounding roads.\n\nHe was accompanied by Dep­uty Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad, Karachi Water and Sewe­rage Corporation CEO Asadullah Khan and local leaders of the PPP.\n\n“This park is dedicated to Shaheed Waja Karim Dad, a prominent social leader of Lyari. The PPP never forgets its martyrs,” he said and explained that the park was developed on the site of a former sewage pumping station and efforts had been made to revitalise the area and protect it from misuse, including drug addiction.\n\n“A similar park has been established around Jamila Pumping Station in Lyari,” he added.\n\nThe mayor also outlined the strategy to address water scarcity and load-shedding issues in the area giving brief details of the planning to address the issue.\n\nIn an effort to reduce water theft and improve infrastructure, Mayor Wahab referred to a project to lay an elevated pipeline system.\n\nThe administration, he said, would handle this project itself and in August, a new canal will be laid to provide a more reliable water supply from the Hub Dam.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 3rd, 2025",
