Saudi Arabia backed the rebels who fought Assad at the onset of the Syrian civil war.\n\nMore recently, Riyadh had embarked on a path of normalising ties with the Assad government, paving the way for Syria to return to the Arab League in 2023, in an effort to reduce Iranian influence in the country and to stem the flow of drugs, including the methamphetamine captagon.\n\nA Saudi source close to the government told Reuters that the kingdom was committed to safeguarding the peace in Syria and that fostering stability was a top priority.\n\n“At this critical juncture, our focus is on delivering essential humanitarian aid to the people of Syria, and we are exploring opportunities for expanded assistance in collaboration with regional partners,” the source added.",
