That is our goal, and that’s what we’re trying to do,” Schwartz said.\n\nHe added that the FBI had identified the person driving the vehicle, which had been rented in Colorado, but was not yet ready to publicly identify the driver.\n\nMusk said the blast was unrelated to the Cybertruck itself.\n\n“We have now confirmed that the explosion was caused by very large fireworks and/or a bomb carried in the bed of the rented Cybertruck and is unrelated to the vehicle itself,” Musk said in a post on X. “All vehicle telemetry was positive at the time of the explosion.”\n\nTelemetry involves the automatic collection of data from remote sources, transmitting it back to a central source so it can later be analyzed.\n\nA person was found dead inside the 2024 model-year Cybertruck and seven people sustained minor injuries from the explosion, McMahill said. He added that both the Cybertruck and the vehicle used in the New Orleans attack had been rented through car-sharing service Turo.\n\nNYC shooting\n\nThe New York Police Department said the 10 injured in the incident outside a private events club late on Wednesday evening included six females and four males and all were expected to recover.\n\nThe incident occurred when three-four males opened fire toward a crowd outside the club, the NYPD said. Users took to social media expressing shock at the incident and sharing pictures of police deployment at the site.\n\nPolice ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack.\n\n‘Suspect acted alone’\n\nMeanwhile, US authorities were scrambling to track down suspects related to the New Orleans and Las Vegas incidents and also investigating possible terrorism angles.\n\nThe FBI said the US Army veteran who drove a truck into a crowd of New Year’s Day revelers had pledged allegiance to Islamic State, but acted alone in the attack.\n\nThe suspect, who was shot dead at the scene after firing at police, has been identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old Texan who once served in Afghanistan.\n\nHe drove from Houston to New Orleans on Dec 31, and posted five videos on Facebook between 1.29am and 3.02am on the morning of the attack in which he said he supported the militant Islamic State group with fighters in Iraq and Syria, the FBI said.\n\nThe FBI said there appeared to be no link between the attack in New Orleans and the episode in Las Vegas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 3rd, 2025",
