He is our asset and we him fully fit whatever time is required. I am personally monitoring his progress,” Mohsin said.\n\nThe Pakistan selectors have held back naming the Champions Trophy squad as they waited to know if Saim would be available for the event being held in Pakistan and Dubai from Feb 19 to March 9.\n\nInitially given six weeks for recovery, the PCB sent Saim to England for check-ups with specialist sports injuries orthopaedic surgeons who are monitoring his recovery process.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2025",
