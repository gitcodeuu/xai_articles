Although a Rs1 million monthly salary was proposed, it was later reduced to Rs519,000.\n\nSources said that before the finance committee’s meeting, legislators from all mainstream parties met the speaker to ask for a raise and also presented a comparison between their and MPAs’ salaries.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2025",
