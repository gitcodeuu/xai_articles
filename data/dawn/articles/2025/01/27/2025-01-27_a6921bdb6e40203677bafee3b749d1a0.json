The PC-I of the project was considered by Central Development Working Party (CDWP) in 2005 that got conditional approval and was updated and considered again in 2008 but returned for updating.\n\nIn 2016, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and federal governments signed a memorandum of understanding, declaring that the feasibility study would be re-conducted while the centre and the province would finance the project at a ratio of 65:35.\n\nThe operation, maintenance and recurring costs of the project will be borne by the province.\n\nGandapur vows to remove hurdles in ongoing schemes\n\nIn June 2022, when CDWP approved CRBC, the then provincial government said that the project would be a game-changer for the development of southern districts. However, it said that approval of the ‘important project’ took 32 years.\n\nOn Sunday, a statement said that the World Bank delegation, led by its vice president for South Asia Martin Raiser, expressed interest in the project during a meeting with Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur at Pakhtunkhwa House, Islamabad.\n\nIt said that the meeting focused on various ongoing public welfare projects supported by World Bank in health, communications, tourism, hydropower, water resources and rural development sectors. It added that both the parties explored new opportunities to expand collaboration between the provincial government and World Bank.\n\nBriefing the meeting about the World Bank-assisted development projects in the province, officials said that work was in progress on various schemes worth $1.9 billion in various sectors. The visiting team also shared details of the institution’s country partnership framework for Pakistan with the chief minister.\n\nDuring the meeting, Mr Gandapur highlighted the provincial government’s vision for poverty alleviation, social protection and human capital development.\n\nHe appreciated World Bank’s cooperation in public welfare initiatives and highlighted his government’s commitment to implementing projects with long-term impacts on the province’s development. He reiterated the provincial government’s focus on encouraging private sector investment and partnerships to accelerate economic growth and create employment opportunities.\n\nThe statement said that the participants of the meeting held a detailed discussion on the implementation of CRBC and Peshawar-Dera Ismail Khan Motorway projects. It added that the chief minister underscored the significance of the proposed motorway, describing it a critical initiative not only for the province but for the entire country’s economic development.\n\nMr Gandapur also highlighted the importance of CRBC for the province’s food security, reaffirming his government’s commitment to those flagship projects.\n\nHe assured the World Bank delegation of his government’s intent to strengthen collaboration in social sectors and vowed to address any hurdle hindering progress of ongoing projects.\n\nHe said that provincial government viewed World Bank’s support as an essential component of its development strategy and was determined to enhance the partnership for the betterment of the region.\n\nMNA Faisal Amin Gandapur, the additional chief secretary of planning and development, Ikramullah Khan, and other officials were also present on the occasion.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2025",
