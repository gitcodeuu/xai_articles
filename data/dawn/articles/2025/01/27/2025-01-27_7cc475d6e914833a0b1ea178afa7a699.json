Schoolchildren are taught about the Holocaust and German political leaders frequently declare “never again”.\n\nBut the AfD, now polling in second place at around 20 per cent, has long courted controversy by calling for Germany to stop focusing on atoning for its World War II crimes, including the genocide of six million European Jews.\n\nOne of its former leaders, Alexander Gauland, once notoriously described the Nazi era as just “a speck of bird poo” in German history.\n\nLast year Bjoern Hoecke, one of the AfD’s most radical leaders, was convicted and fined twice for using a banned Nazi slogan, “Alles fuer Deutschland” (Everything for Germany).\n\nDespite its popularity, the AfD is unlikely to enter government after the February 23 polls, as all mainstream parties have ruled out working with it and many Germans remain fiercely opposed to the party. Tens of thousands rallied in cities across the country on Saturday against the far right.\n\nNevertheless, the German political establishment is increasingly worried that the far-right’s views are gaining traction.\n\n“Our culture of remembrance is facing fundamental challenges,” Culture Minister Claudia Roth said Monday. “Disinformation, conspiracy theories and hate speech can now spread almost without limit in important social media,” she said.\n\n“This is all the more worrying given that there is currently a rapidly advancing relativisation and deliberately pursued historical amnesia in the use of terms and gestures that are historically associated with” the Nazi era, she said.\n\nThe Central Council of Jews in Germany is worried that there are fewer witnesses left with a connection to the Nazi era, and called for initiatives to increase visits to sites of “Nazi crimes”.\n\nLast week the group’s president Josef Schuster criticised the “propaganda raging” against remembrance culture. “The parliamentary arm of this propaganda, the AfD, already has a seat in regional parliaments and the Bundestag,” he lamented.\n\nSpeaking in Auschwitz on Monday, German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier told AFP: “I don’t think Musk is waiting for my advice. But my conviction remains, there is no end point to our responsibility.\n\n“What happened here, in this place and in many other camps during the Nazi tyranny, is part of our history, and therefore also part of our identity that we must grapple with,” he added.\n\n“To those who think you can draw a line under it, I recommend that they come here and talk to the survivors. “",
