  "content": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Sunday ordered sweeping tariffs and sanctions against Colombia in retaliation for its refusal to accept deportation flights, doubling down on his immigration crackdown as he sought to silence a chorus of defiance in Latin America.\n\nTrump, back into office for less than a week, said he would impose tariffs of 25pc on Colombian products that would rise to 50pc in a week.\n\nHis authority to do so was unclear as Colombia, historically one of Washington’s closest allies in Latin America, enjoys a free-trade agreement with the United States.\n\nTrump also said he would immediately revoke visas for Colombian government officials and “supporters” of President Gustavo Petro — and subject Colombians to greater scrutiny at airports.\n\n“These measures are just the beginning. We will not allow the Colombian government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the criminals they forced into the United States!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nThe remarks came in reaction to Colombia’s president announcement to block US deportation flights until migrants were guaranteed “dignified treatment,” escalating a row between Washington and left-wing Latin American governments over US President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.\n\n“The United States cannot treat Colombian migrants as criminals. I forbid entry to our territory to US planes carrying Colombian migrants,” President Gustavo Petro wrote on X.\n\nIn a later post, he said he had “turned back US military planes,” without saying when or how many planes were involved.\n\nHe added however that he would allow in civilian US flights carrying deported migrants, as long as they were not treated “like criminals.”\n\nThe president later said over 15,600 undocumented Americans were living in Colombia and urged them to “regularise their situation,” while ruling out raids to arrest and deport them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2025",
