  "content": "Alhurra, the Arabic-language network created by the US government after the Iraq invasion, said on Saturday it would cease broadcasts and lay off most staff after US President Donald Trump’s administration shut off funds.\n\nThe network went on air in 2004, when US officials were complaining about coverage of the Iraq war from Qatar-backed Al Jazeera — which two decades later maintains a dominant role in Arabic-language media.\n\n“Media in the Middle East thrive on a diet of anti-Americanism,” said Jeffrey Gedmin, president and CEO of Middle East Broadcasting Networks (MBN), the parent of Alhurra and other smaller US-funded Arabic-language outlets.\n\nGedmin added in a statement that It made “no sense to kill MBN” as a sensible alternative and to open the field to American adversaries and extremists.\n\nThe Trump administration, in part of a sweeping cost-cutting drive led by billionaire Elon Musk, in March said it was ceasing all financial transfers for US government-supported media.\n\nThe move quickly froze Voice of America, although its employees have mounted legal challenges to restore the funding, which was approved by Congress.\n\nIn a memo to staff, Gedmin said that Kari Lake, a firebrand Trump supporter put in charge of the agency supervising US-funded media, had refused to see him to discuss the “unlawfully” withdrawn funds.\n\n“I’m left to conclude that she is deliberately starving us of the money we need to pay you, our dedicated and hard-working staff,” he wrote.\n\n“What’s happening is a disgrace. You deserve better and I bear responsibility for not resolving this crisis in time to keep you,” said Gedmin, a veteran scholar of democracy.\n\nAlhurra will cease broadcasts but seek to maintain digital updates through a staff reduced to “a couple dozen”, he wrote.\n\nAlhurra says it reaches more than 30 million people each week across 22 countries.\n\nBut it has faced stiff competition from Al Jazeera as well as Al Arabiya, which is funded by Saudi Arabia, and more recently UAE-backed Sky News Arabia.\n\nTrump has a testy relationship with media and has questioned the “firewall” under which US-funded outlets were promised editorial independence.\n\nUnlike VOA, Alhurra was not considered part of the US government, instead receiving grants to operate.\n\nOther outlets in similar situations have also tried to press on.\n\nRadio Free Europe, which played a vital role in the Cold War and is now based in Prague, has won promises of support from the Czech government to step in to replace US funding.\n\nRadio Free Asia, aimed at providing news to China, North Korea and other Asian countries without free media, has been providing online news at a reduced pace.",
