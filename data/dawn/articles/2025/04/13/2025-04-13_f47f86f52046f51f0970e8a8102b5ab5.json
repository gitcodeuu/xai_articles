  "content": "United States Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth reiterated on Sunday that the United States hopes for a diplomatic solution to keep Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, but if that failed, the military was ready “to go deep and to go big”.\n\nUS and Iranian diplomats opened indirect talks on Saturday in Oman in an effort to resolve Western concerns about Iran’s nuclear program.\n\nHegseth on Sunday described the first, tentative contacts in Oman as “productive” and “a good step”. He told CBS’s “Face the Nation” that while President Donald Trump hoped to never have to resort to a military option, “We’ve shown a capability to go far, to go deep and to go big.”\n\n“Again, we don’t want to do that, but if we have to, we will to prevent the nuclear bomb in Iran’s hands.”\n\nTrump said on Wednesday that military action was “absolutely” possible — in conjunction with Israel — if the talks in Oman failed.\n\n“If it requires military, we’re going to have military,” he told reporters.\n\n“Israel will obviously be very much involved in that, be the leader of that.”\n\nThat followed a blunt warning in late March that “if they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing.”\n\nTrump pulled the United States out of an earlier multi-nation nuclear agreement with Iran in 2018, during his first term in the White House.\n\nAnalysts say Iran may now be just weeks away from producing a deliverable nuclear weapon — though Tehran denies it is building such arms.",
