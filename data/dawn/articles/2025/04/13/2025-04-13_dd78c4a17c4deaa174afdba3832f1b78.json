However, the driver, in his statement, claimed that the pillion-riders came under the wheels of the trailer while involved in over-speeding.\n\nThe Mithadar police have registered a first information report under section 320 of the Pakistan Penal Code on the complaint of Yaseen, maternal uncle of the deceased persons. He said the victims were close relatives and residents of Edu Lane in Kalri area of Lyari.\n\nLate on Thursday night, a water tanker was torched by an angry mob in North Nazimabad. Shahrah-i-Noor Jehan SHO Abid Husain Shah told Dawn that the tanker driver had struck a motorcyclist near Paposh Nagar. The bike rider was injured, but the tanker driver fled the scene along with the heavy vehicle.\n\nHowever, a group of 10-12 people chased and intercepted him near Five Star Chowrangi. They initially attacked the driver and damaged the vehicle’s windows. Thereafter, they set the heavy vehicle on fire.\n\nWith recent traffic accidents in Karachi causing enraged mobs to torch heavy vehicles that were responsible for them, Awami National Party (ANP) Sindh Chapter President Shahi Sayed along with MQM-P Chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, tried to pacify the situation by saying that the ongoing issues plaguing the city including road mishaps are an administrative failure, not the product of an ethnic issue, on Saturday.\n\nOn Friday, Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that the provincial government had formed a fact-finding committee to investigate the causes of traffic accidents that had suddenly increased since November last in the metropolis.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, he said that since November 2024, 603 people had been killed in road traffic accidents, 160 of them involving heavy vehicles.",
