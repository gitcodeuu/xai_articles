Nights are also expected to remain unusually warm, increasing health risks.\n\nThe Met Office has attributed the extreme conditions to a high-pressure system in the upper atmosphere, which may also trigger dust storms and windstorms.\n\nPunjab Relief Commissioner Nabeel Javed has directed all divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, and district administrations to remain on high alert.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 13th, 2025",
