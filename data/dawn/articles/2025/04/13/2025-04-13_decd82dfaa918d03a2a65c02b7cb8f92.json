Officials said such tools could help reduce resource wastage and ensure a more efficient and responsive bureaucracy.\n\nChief Minister Bugti directed Chief Secretary Shakeel Qadir Khan and Secretary Finance Imran Zarkoon to devise a realistic and actionable plan for embedding AI solutions in the governance framework.\n\nHe stressed that information technology must be central to improving service delivery and institutional accountability.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 13th, 2025",
