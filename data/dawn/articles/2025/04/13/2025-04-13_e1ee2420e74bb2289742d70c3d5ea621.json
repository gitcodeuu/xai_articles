Last season, Multan Sultans hit 76 sixes and claimed 94 wickets, highlighting the potential impact of this initiative.\n\nAli Tareen, the franchise owner, emphasised the dual focus of the campaign.\n\n“Cricket unites people, and we want to channel that spirit into supporting a vital cause,” he said. “While we aim to excel on the field, we are equally dedicated to standing with children in need.”\n\nThe initiative has garnered support from the team’s players, management, and partners, a Sultans statement said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 13th, 2025",
