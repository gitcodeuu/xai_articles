  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan’s women’s cricket team continued their dominant run in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier, securing a commanding six-wicket victory over Scotland in a rain-shortened clash here at the LCCA Ground on Friday.\n\nThe win, powered by stellar performances from Aliya Riaz and Muneeba Ali, propelled Pakistan to the top of the group standings with four points from two matches, boosting their hopes of securing a World Cup berth.\n\nChasing a revised target of 187 in 32 overs due to morning rain, Pakistan reached 190 for the loss of four wickets in 30.4 overs.\n\nAliya played a brilliant knock of 68 off 70 balls while Muneeba scored 71 off 72 deliveries to steer the innings after early hiccups.\n\nThe duo’s 93-run partnership for the third wicket rescued Pakistan from a shaky 36 for two, which saw openers Gull Feroza (two) and Sidra Amin (seven) fall cheaply.\n\nMuneeba, though gifted four reprieves by Scotland’s sloppy fielding, capitalised on her luck, smashing nine fours and a six.\n\nAliya — fresh off her half-century against Ireland — anchored the chase with aggression, hitting seven fours and a six, and remained unbeaten alongside Sidra Nawaz (14 not out) to seal the win with eight balls to spare.\n\nEarlier, Pakistan’s bowlers set the stage for victory, restricting Scotland to 186 for the loss of nine wickets in their 32 overs.\n\nCaptain Fatima Sana starred with the ball as she recorded her career-best spell, taking four wickets while giving away just 23 runs.\n\nThe 23-year-old Fatima also took the the prized scalp of Scottish skipper Kathryn Bryce, who top-scored with a gritty 91 off 96 balls (10 fours, one six).\n\nBryce’s resistance was supported briefly by Ailsa Lister (31) and Sarah Bryce (21), but Fatima’s fiery spell, coupled with early strikes from Sadia Iqbal (2-43) and Diana Baig (1-31), kept Scotland in check.\n\nWI EDGE IRELAND IN THRILLER\n\nAt the Gaddafi Stadium, West Indies kept their World Cup hopes alive with a nail-biting six-run win over Ireland in another rain-affected fixture.\n\nDefending 182 in 33 overs, Windies skipper Hayley Matthews (4-24) delivered a match-winning final over, dismissing Arlene Kelly to clinch victory with Ireland needing eight runs off six balls.\n\nIreland’s chase, fuelled by Amy Hunter (48) and Laura Delaney (32), collapsed from 122 for five wickets to 175 all out, despite a late fight from Kelly (12) and Ava Canning (eight).\n\nEarlier, West Indies recovered from an early collapse — triggered by Ireland’s powerplay strikes against Matthews (nine) and Qiana Joseph (two) — thanks to Stefanie Taylor (46), Chinelle Henry (46) and teenager Zaida James (36).\n\nJane Maguire’s 3-35 kept the Caribbean side to 181-6 in 33 overs, but Ireland’s batting faltered under pressure.\n\nPakistan’s back-to-back wins position them strongly ahead of critical clashes against the West Indies on Monday and Thailand on Thursday, with just one more victory likely securing their World Cup spot.\n\nScotland, despite the loss, remain in contention with two points, while Ireland languish at the bottom — just over Thailand — after consecutive defeats.\n\nFor the West Indies, fourth, the victory over Ireland marked a crucial rebound following their shock opening loss to Scotland.\n\nBangladesh are second after winning their opening fixture against Thailand and will face Ireland on Monday.\n\nTop two teams from the six-team group will qualify for the World Cup.\n\nBrief Scores:\n\nPAKISTAN 190-4 in 30.4 overs (Muneeba Ali 71, Aliya Riaz 68 not out; C. Abel 2-42) v SCOTLAND 186-9 in 32 overs (K. Bryce 91, A. Lister 31; Fatima Sana 4-23)\n\nWEST INDIES 166-9 in 50 overs (S. Taylor 46, C. Henry 46 not out; J. Maguire 3-35) v IRELAND 160 in 48.2 overs (A. Hunter 48, L. Delaney 32; H. Matthews 4-24).\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 12th, 2025",
