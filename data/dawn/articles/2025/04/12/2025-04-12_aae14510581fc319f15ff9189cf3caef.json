Excessive heating/ris­ing temperatures may generate duststorm/windstorm during the forecast period,” it said.\n\nThe PMD said that due to heatwave conditions, general public, especially children, women and senior citizens should take precautionary measures and avoid themselves from direct exposure to sunlight during day time and remain hydrated.\n\nFarmers have also been advised to manage their crop activities (wheat harvesting) keeping in view the weather conditions and take care of their livestock as well.\n\nRising temperatures in northern areas may enhance snowmelt rate from April 14 to 18.\n\nThe PMD advised government departments to stay alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation due to these weather conditions.\n\nThe Met Office also said that there is also acute shortage of water in the Tarbela and Mangla dams and water in different rivers is flowing at extreme low level.\n\nBelow average rainfall\n\nThe country has experienced significantly below average rainfall during the first quarter of 2025, with an overall decline of 41 per cent compared to normal levels, and Punjab and Sindh were particularly affected, recording extreme departures from normal rains at 92 per cent and 96 per cent, respectively.\n\nThe most pronounced deficit occurred in January, when rainfall was substantially lower than average across the country, Pakistan Meteorological Depar­tment said in its quarterly drought bulletin, issued on Friday.\n\nThe dry conditions persisted into February, with rainfall departures ranging from minus eight per cent to minus 97 per cent across most regions, excluding Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, which experienced relatively normal rainfall.\n\nThe Drought Monitor for March 2025 shows moderate drought affected regions as Turbat, Jiwani, Ormara, Dadu, Mithi, Badin, Thatta, Shaheed Benazirabad, and Karachi. Mild drought conditions have been observed in various parts of Sindh, Balochistan, and southern Punjab.\n\nThe recorded below normal rainfall has caused soil moisture deficit in Potohar region, Sialkot region, Kashmir, a few parts of upper KP, and south western Balochistan, which indicates the depleted soil moisture leading to drought conditions, crop stress, and a clear sign of water scarcity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 12th, 2025",
