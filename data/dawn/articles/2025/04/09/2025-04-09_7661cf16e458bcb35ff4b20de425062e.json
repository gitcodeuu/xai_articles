The sources spoke on the condition of anonymity due to political sensitivities.\n\nHezbollah’s media office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The presidency declined to comment.\n\nIsrael, which sent ground troops into south Lebanon during the conflict, has largely withdrawn but decided in February not to leave the five hilltop positions. It said it intended eventually to hand them over to Lebanese troops once it was sure the security situation allowed.\n\nDespite a ceasefire since November, Israeli airstrikes have kept pressure on the group while Washington has demanded Hezbollah to disarm and is preparing for nuclear talks with Iran.\n\nReuters reported on Monday that several militia groups in Iraq are prepared to disarm for the first time to avert the threat of an escalating conflict with the Trump administration in the US.\n\nHezbollah has long rejected calls from its critics in Lebanon to disarm, describing its weapons as vital to defending the country from Israel. Deep differences over its arsenal spilled into a short civil war in 2008.\n\nThe group’s critics say the group has unilaterally dragged Lebanon into conflicts and the presence of its large arsenal outside of government control has undermined the state.\n\nA US-brokered ceasefire with Israel requires the Lebanese army to dismantle all unauthorised military facilities and confiscate all arms, starting in areas south of the Litani River, which flows into the Mediterranean some 20km north of the Israeli border.\n\nTwo sources familiar with Hezbollah’s thinking said it is weighing handing to the army its most potent weapons north of the Litani, including drones and anti-tank missiles.\n\nAoun has said Hezbollah’s weaponry must be addressed through dialogue because any attempts to disarm the group by force would prompt conflict, the sources said.\n\nPatriarch Bechara Boutros Al-Rai, the head of Lebanon’s Maronite church, said last week it was time for all weapons to be in state hands but this would need time and diplomacy because “Lebanon cannot bear a new war”.\n\nCommunication channels with relevant stakeholders are being opened to “begin studying the transfer of weapons” to state control, after the army and security services had extended state authority across Lebanon, a Lebanese official said, saying this was a move to implement Aoun’s policy.\n\nThe issue was also being discussed with Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, an important Hezbollah ally, who plays a key role in narrowing differences, she said.\n\nUS envoy Morgan Ortagus, who visited Beirut at the weekend, repeated Washington’s position that Hezbollah and other armed groups should be disarmed as soon as possible and the Lebanese army was expected to do the job.\n\n“It’s clear that Hezbollah has to be disarmed and it’s clear that Israel is not going to accept terrorists shooting at them, into their country, and that’s a position we understand,” Ortagus said in an April 6 interview with Lebanon’s LBCI television.\n\nSeveral Lebanese government ministers want a disarmament timetable, said Kamal Shehadi, a minister affiliated with the anti-Hezbollah Lebanese Forces party. Shehadi told Reuters disarmament should take no more than six months, citing post-civil war militia disarmament as a precedent.\n\nA timetable — which presumably would impose deadlines on the process — is, he said, the “only way to protect our fellow citizens from the recurring attacks that are costing lives, costing the economy and causing destruction”.\n\nHe said he and other ministers hoped the full cabinet would endorse the idea and task the minister of defense with preparing the timetable. “We’re going to keep asking for it,” he said.\n\nThe most recent conflict began when Hezbollah opened fire in support of Hamas at the start of Israel’s war in Gaza in October 2023.\n\nHezbollah leader Naim Qassem, in a March 29 speech,h said his group no longer has an armed presence south of the Litani, and had stuck to the ceasefire deal while Israel breached it “every day”.\n\nIsrael has accused Hezbollah of maintaining military infrastructure in the south.\n\nHezbollah has put the onus on the Lebanese state to get Israel to withdraw and stop its attacks.\n\nQassem said there was still time for diplomatic solutions. But he warned that the “resistance is present and ready” and indicated it could resort “to other options” if Israel doesn’t adhere to the deal.",
