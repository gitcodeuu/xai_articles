The club has a capacity for about 1,700 people.\n\nPerez was on stage when there was a blackout and the roof came crashing down, according to eyewitness reports. Perez’s daughter Zulinka told reporters she had managed to escape after the roof collapsed, but he did not.\n\nAlso among the dead was the governor of the Monte Cristi municipality, Nelsy Cruz, according to President Luis Abinader. He declared three days of national mourning.\n\nThe death toll had reached 113 by Wednesday morning, said Mendez of the Emergency Operations Center. “No people have been found alive since 3:00 pm (Tuesday),” he said earlier.\n\nIris Pena, a woman who had attended the show, told SIN television how she escaped with her son.\n\n“At one point, dirt started falling like dust into the drink on the table,” she said. “A stone fell and cracked the table where we were, and we got out,” Pena recounted. “The impact was so strong, as if it had been a tsunami or an earthquake.”\n\nDozens of family members flocked to hospitals for news.\n\n“We are desperate,” Regina del Rosa, whose sister was at the concert, told SIN. “They are not giving us news, they are not telling us anything.”\n\nHelicopter images revealed a large hole where the club’s roof once was.\n\nAuthorities have issued a call for Dominicans to donate blood.\n\nArtists paid tribute to Rubby Perez on social media, with former colleague Wilfrido Vargas saying he was “devastated.” “The friend and idol of our genre has left us,” Vargas wrote.\n\n“Maestro, what a great pain he leaves us,” wrote Puerto Rican singer Olga Tanon. The Instagram page of the Jet Set club said it has been in operation for more than 50 years, with shows every Monday until the early hours.\n\nIts last post before Monday’s event invited fans to come and “enjoy his (Perez’s) greatest hits and dance in the country’s best nightclub.” The club issued a statement on Tuesday saying it was working “fully and transparently” with authorities.\n\nThe Jet Set collapse was one of the biggest tragedies the Caribbean nation and top tourist destination has faced in recent years.\n\nIn 2023, around 40 people were killed and dozens injured in an explosion linked to a plastics company in San Cristobal, near Santo Domingo.\n\nAnd in 2005, more than 130 prisoners in the east of the country died in a fire caused by a fight between inmates.\n\nTourism generates about 15 per cent of GDP in the country, with millions of annual visitors attracted by its music, nightlife, Caribbean beaches and the colonial architecture of the capital.",
