  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) has opened an inquiry against president of the Human Rights Cell of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and former senator Farhatullah Babar over the alleged “corruption, tax evasion and illicit asset accumulation”.\n\nSources told Dawn that Mr Babar had already appeared before the FIA’s Anti-Corruption Cell in Islamabad just a day before Eid holidays to respond to the notice issued by the FIA on the basis of a complaint fi led by a common citizen living in Rawalpindi’s Morgah locality.\n\nIt has been learnt that the FIA authorities had asked Mr Babar to produce some documents about his income and assets after the Eid holidays.\n\nIn response, Mr Babar had now asked the FIA to provide him with a copy of the complaint along with copies of notices issued by the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), tax returns, asset declarations and any other document(s) on the basis of which the complainant had demanded FIA inquiry against him.\n\nMr Babar had stated that he had not held any official position since 2013 when he served as spokesperson to President Asif Ali Zardari.\n\nWhen contacted, Mr Babar confirmed receipt of the FIA’s notice and said that he would follow legal course to respond.\n\n“The sequence and timing of the events, the abruptness of launching inquiry on the basis of a private complaint is highly puzzling,” he said, adding: “I have no idea who’s behind it and will give the benefit of doubt.” According to him, the FBR issued a notice to him on March 21 and even before he received the notice, a private citizen in Rawalpindi lodged a complaint with the FIA’s anti-corruption circle on March 23, demanding action against him alleging corruption and misuse of authority.\n\nThe FIA admitted the complaint and issued a notice to Mr Babar on March 25 to appear before it on March 28, a day before the commencement of Eid holidays.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
