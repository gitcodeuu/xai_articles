Malik in her detailed reasons explaining why the five-judge bench had nullified the military trial of civilians involved in the May 9 violence.\n\nThe AGP had also assured the previous Supreme Court bench that no offence carrying the death penalty or a lengthy sentence would be made against any detained civilian.\n\nThe accused will also have the right to appoint private lawyers, while family members and the legal team of the accused will be allowed to attend trial proceedings, AGP Awan had told the court in 2023.\n\nThe evidence would be recorded during the trial as per the law and procedure in regular criminal court. Besides, the judgement delivered in the trial of the accused would be supported by reasons, he had said.\n\nDuring the hearing on Tuesday, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar recalled certain points regarding the AGP’s statement on the right to appeal were also mentioned by the bench in its order nullifying the military trial.\n\nWhat is the guarantee that rights are granted during the military trial of civilians, asked Justice Mazhar.\n\nHe referred to the International Court of Justice’s judgement asking Pakistan to ensure counsellor access to Indian spy Commander Kulbushan Sudhir Jadhav.\n\nDuring the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail emphasised the need to ensure a free trial.\n\nHe said that for a free trial, the accused should be allowed the right to appeal before an independent forum.\n\nThe judge also remarked that every offence was against the interest of the State and wondered whether the attack on Jaffar Express last month was against the interest of the state or not.\n\nJustice Mandokhail also questioned the reason for bringing civilians into the ambit of the PAA.\n\nMr Ahmed, the defence ministry’s counsel, contended the role of the armed forces was to defend the country.\n\nHowever, they would not be able to maintain discipline among their ranks if distracted through conspiracies or faced with mutiny, he aruged.\n\nThe counsel explained that whenever a civilian seduces the personnel of armed forces not to discharge their official duties, they will become subject to army laws and tried through military courts since discipline has to be maintained in armed forces at all cost.\n\nThe counsel emphasised that the Constitution, which conferred rights on citizens, also created exceptions in certain cases.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
