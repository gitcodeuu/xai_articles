He emphasised that the minerals sector of Pakistan presented immense opportunities and encouraged US companies to invest in this priority sector, according to Radio Pakistan.\n\nIt further said the premier underscored the importance of enhanced cooperation in areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment and counterterrorism.\n\nHe highlighted the significance of Pakistan-US relations not only in the bilateral context but also for regional peace and security, the report added.\n\nThe US delegation later called on Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir at General Headquarters in Rawalpindi, according to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).\n\n“Appreciating the first-of-its-kind forum, the delegation expressed confidence in Pakistan’s policy to develop vast untapped mineral wealth through mutually beneficial partnerships,” the statement reads.\n\nCommenting on the US administration’s priorities, where collaboration in mineral development with Pakistan was an area of mutual interest, Meyer “expressed interest in Pakistan’s steadily improving investment landscape”, the statement read.\n\nThe ISPR said that the meeting also allowed both sides to share perspectives on global developments and Pakistan’s regional security objectives.\n\n“Both sides expressed confidence about the positive trajectory of bilateral relations and agreed on the need to explore B2B avenues in addition to expanding existing G2G and P2P cooperation for comprehensively strengthening the relationship,” the ISPR said.",
