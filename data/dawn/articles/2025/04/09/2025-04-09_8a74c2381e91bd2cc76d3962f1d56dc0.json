The arrest came days after the National Human Rights Commission launched a probe into the deaths of seven patients at Mission Hospital this year.\n\nAll seven people had und­ergone angioplasty surgeries by the arrested man.\n\n‘Very disconcerting’\n\nLocal media said he had impersonated a real cardiologist in Britain called John Camm, an emeritus professor of clinical cardiology at St George’s University of London.\n\nThere is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by the British-based Camm, who said that the case had been “very disconcerting”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
