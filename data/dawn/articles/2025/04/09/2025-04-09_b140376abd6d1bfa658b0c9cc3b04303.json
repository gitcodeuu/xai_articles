  "content": "KARACHI: Following a reduction in wheat prices, the rates for various types of flour have dropped in the wholesale market. However, only a few retailers have passed on this relief to consumers.\n\nKarachi Wholesalers Grocers Association (KWGA) Chairman Rauf Ibrahim said the wholesale price of flour No. 2.5 fell to Rs67 from Rs80 per kg and that of fine flour to Rs76 from Rs84 per kg over the past couple of days.\n\nAttributing the price drop in wholesale rates to plunging wheat rates, he said a number of retailers continued to charge Rs100 per kg for flour No. 2.5 and Rs110 for fine flour. Chakki flour is available at Rs120 per kg.\n\nSome market retailers have shown flexibility by claiming to have reduced prices by Rs10 per kg for both flour varieties. They are currently charging Rs90 per kg for flour No. 2.5 and Rs100 for fine flour, although these rates rem­ain significantly hig­her than the wholesale prices.\n\nAamir Abdullah, central executive member of the Pakistan Flour Mills Association, Sindh Zone, said that millers had reduced flour rates following a Rs15 per kg drop in wheat prices.\n\nDespite a drop in wholesale flour rates, the prices of Chapati (100 grams), Tandoori Naan (120 gra­ms), Tandoori Nan (140-150 grams) and Tandoor Naan (180 grams) still reflect the officially fixed prices of Rs10, Rs15, Rs18 and Rs23 per piece, respectively.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
