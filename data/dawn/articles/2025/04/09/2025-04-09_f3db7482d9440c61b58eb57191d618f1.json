  "content": "LAHORE: Hosts Pakistan take on Ireland in the opening match of the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nBoth the teams look almost equal in strength with 10th and 11th ranking on the ICC table, respectively. West Indies, Bangladesh, Scotland and Thailand are the other participating teams in the event.\n\nIn head-to-head ODI record, Pakistan have held a clear edge over Ireland winning 15 while losing six.\n\nInterestingly, the Irish women from 1997 to 2003 won all six ODIs against their Pakistan counterparts while one game was abandoned. Since 2008 to date, however, Pakistan have held an immaculate record against them. It was here in Lahore where both the teams clashed last time in a three-match bilateral series in 2022 when the hosts comfortably swept the series.\n\nHaving won both their warm-ups against Thailand and West Indies, Pakistan — who are hosting an ICC women event for the first time — look in good shape to earn a place in top two positions of the qualifying event to reach the main event of the World Cup.\n\nLahore’s temperature, which touched 41 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, is not a good sign for the six participating teams, who may find it significantly tough to give their best in scorching heat. However, cloudy weather has been forecast for Wednesday.\n\nPakistan, who are competing in the Qualifier for the fourth time, qualified for the World Cup on all three occasions.\n\nAll-rounder Fatima Sana, who led Pakistan at the ICC Women’s T20 World Cup last year, will again captain the country in the event.\n\nFatima’s team-mate Shawaal Zulfiqar, 19, is returning to the squad after 2023 following her recovery from a shoulder injury.\n\nThe worrisome area for Pakistan ahead of the qualifying event is that they lost their recent ODI series to England, West Indies and New Zealand.\n\nFatima, however sounded upbeat, saying the team would look to produce their best in the qualifying event.\n\n“Leading my country in this prestigious event on home soil is a great honour for me. The team is very excited to step onto the field with a positive mindset and play our best cricket and give our best to secure a place in the World Cup, Insha Allah,” she said.\n\nIt is now 23 years since Ireland won the very first ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier and they enter the 2025 edition in Pakistan looking to book their place at the main event once more.\n\nCaptained by Gaby Lewis, Ireland are a blend of youth and experience as they target a top-two finish.\n\nWhile their most recent ODI action was a difficult tour of India, Ireland previously enjoyed some good T20 results away to Bangladesh, while last September, they pulled off a first ODI win over England in more than 20 years.\n\nOf the less experienced members of the squad, teenager Kia McCartney was part of the Ireland team at the ICC U-19 Women’s T20 World Cup in Malaysia earlier this year, while Amy Hunter – who missed that event through injury — holds the record of being the youngest-ever ODI century maker.\n\nCoach Ed Joyce said: “This tournament will be a great challenge for testing the depth of the senior squad, while we manage a number of player injuries that have been sustained over the last several months,” Joyce said.\n\n“Given the volume of matches and upcoming tournaments, there is a need to develop a wider talent pool of players ready to step up and cope with the demands of international cricket.”\n\nTeams (from):\n\nPAKISTAN: Fatima Sana (captain), Najiha Alvi, Gull Feroze, Sidra Amin, Omaima Sohail, Aliya Riaz, Diana Baig, Sadiq Iqbal, Nashra Sundhu, Muneeba Ali, Rameen Shamim, Shawaal Zulfiqar, Syeda Aroob Shah, Natalia Parvaiz, Sidra Nawaz.\n\nIRELAND: Gaby Lewis (captain), Ava Canning, Christina Coulter Reilly, Alana Dalzell, Laura Delany, Sarah Forbes, Amy Hunter, Arlene Kelly, Louise Little, Sophie MacMahon, Jane Maquire, Kia McCartney, Cara Murray, Leah Paul, Orla Prendergast (vie-captain).\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
