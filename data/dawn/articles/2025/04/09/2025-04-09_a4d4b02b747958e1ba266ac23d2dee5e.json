However, they felt unconscious after inhaling the poisonous gas which had accumulated inside the mine.\n\nOther labourers outside the mine informed the owner that no signal was coming from the miners working inside.\n\nThe mines department launched a search operation with the help of miners to rescue the victims working at a depth of more than 1,000 feet, according to Mines Inspector Sabbir Shah.\n\nHe added that the two men were trapped inside the mine due to the presence of methane gas and fell into a water pit.\n\nThe rescue workers were trying to reach the trapped miners but faced difficulties due to the presence of a large amount of methane gas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
