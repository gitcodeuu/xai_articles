  "content": "TEHRAN: Iran’s top diplomat said on Tuesday he believed a nuclear deal could be agreed with the United States provided Washington showed sufficient goodwill in talks, scheduled to begin in Oman on April 12.\n\nForeign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran’s principal aim remained the lifting of sweeping US sanctions. Their reimposition by President Donald Trump in 2018 has dealt a heavy blow to the Iranian economy.\n\nTrump made the surprise announcement that his administration would open talks with Iran during a White House meeting on Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTrump said the talks would be “direct”, but Araghchi insisted his negotiations with US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff on Saturday would be “indirect”.\n\n“We will not accept any other form of negotiation,” Araghchi told reporters. “The format of the negotiations… is not the most important thing in my view. What really counts is the effectiveness or otherwise of the talks.\n\n“If the other side shows enough of the necessary willingess, a deal can be found… The ball is in America’s court.”\n\nSpeaking in the Oval Office on Monday, the US president said he was hopeful of reaching a deal with Tehran, but warned that the latter would be in “great danger” if the talks failed.\n\n“We’re dealing with the Iranians, we have a very big meeting on Sat­urday and we’re dealing with them directly,” Trump told reporters.\n\nThe announcement came after Iran dismissed direct negotiations on a new deal on its nuclear programme, calling the idea pointless.\n\nThe US president pulled out of the last deal in 2018, during his first presidency, and there has been widespread speculation that Israel, possibly with US help, might attack Iranian facilities if no new agreement is reached.\n\n‘Great danger’\n\nPresident Trump issued a stern warning to Tehran, however.\n\n“I think if the talks aren’t successful with Iran, I think Iran’s going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it, great danger, because they can’t have a nuclear weapon,” he said. In an interview with US network NBC late last month. Trump went further.\n\n“If they don’t make a deal, there will be bombing,” he said.\n\nChina and Russia held consultations with Iran in Moscow on Tuesday, after which the Kremlin welcomed the planned talks.\n\nRussia, a key Iranian ally, welcomed the prospect of negotiations for a new nuclear accord to replace the deal with major powers that was unilaterally abandoned by Trump in 2018.\n\n“We know that certain contacts — direct and indirect — are planned in Oman. And, of course, this can only be welcomed because it can lead to de-escalation of tensions around Iran,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, adding that Moscow “absolutely” supported the initiative. China called on the United States to “stop its wrong practice of using force to exert extreme pressure” after Trump threatened Iran with bombing if it fails to agree a deal.\n\n“As the country that unilaterally withdrew from the comprehensive agreement on the Iran nuclear issue and caused the current situation, the United States should demonstrate political sincerity (and)… mutual respect,” its foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said.\n\nWashington should “participate in dialogue and consultation, and at the same time stop its wrong practice of using force to exert extreme pressure”, Lin added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
