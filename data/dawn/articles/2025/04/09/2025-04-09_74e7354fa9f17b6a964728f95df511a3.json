He assured complete support from the federal government, provinces, institutions and the Army in this regard.\n\nHe highlighted the mineral potential across all provinces — from Punjab’s Chiniot iron ore reserves to Sindh’s vast coal deposits and the untapped resources of KP, AJK and GB.\n\nThe prime minister said the government would no longer allow the export of raw materials. “Instead, investors must establish downstream industries to process minerals locally and export finished products. This policy is now a cardinal principle for international partnerships,” he declared.\n\nThe prime minister also welcomed all the companies from Europe, the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Turkiye, etc, to invest in the country’s minerals sector. He encouraged them to invest in vocational training centres for Pakistani youth, enabling them to develop modern skills and become future entrepreneurs.\n\nHe informed the participants that provincial governments had been working to provide a conducive environment to foreign investors.\n\nPM Shehbaz specifically lauded Mark Bristow, the CEO of Barrick Gold, for his commitment to the Reko Diq project.\n\n“Under his leadership, a decades-old stalled project is now progressing and should serve as an example to others,” the premier said.\n\nGlobal supply chains\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Pakistan is strategically poised to become a global mining hub.\n\nIn his opening remarks at the event, he said the country holds vast untapped reserves of rare earth elements, industrial minerals and gemstones, anchored in the Tethyan Metallogenic Belt — home to Reko Diq, one of the world’s largest copper-gold deposits.\n\n“As an advocate of economic diplomacy, I consider it a crucial tool in our shared mission to transform Pakistan’s trade and investment landscape not only broadly but also specifically within the minerals sector,” he remarked.\n\n“Strong remittance inflows and increasing FDI are providing much-needed foreign exchange, boosting domestic consumption, investments and overall economic growth,” Mr Dar said.\n\n“These achievements, coupled with improved credit ratings from Fitch and Moody’s, underscore our commitment to economic stability and fiscal discipline.”\n\nHe said the government had prioritised the strategic development of the minerals sector through progressive policy reforms and investor-centric initiatives.\n\nBy aligning its regulatory frameworks with competitive fiscal terms, Pakistan was positioning itself as a dynamic hub for sustainable, high-yield ventures in resource exploration, extraction, refining, logistics and infrastructure, Mr Dar added.\n\n“To truly unlock the true potential of this sector, we need more than just capital… Investment in the mineral sector represents not only financial opportunity but a vital step towards securing a sustainable and technologically adva­nced future for generations to come,” he said.\n\nHe said the forum provided a unique platform for stakeholders, friendly countries and partners to converge, explore new prospects and build mutually beneficial partnerships.\n\n“This forum is anchored in the three pillars — potential, people and policy — a vision the government of Pakistan is implementing to drive shared prosperity and sustainable growth… Let us fully appreciate the tremendous value of this sector and the responsibility that comes with it. Let us invest with purpose, with foresight, and with the collective well-being of the people of Pakistan in mind,” he added.\n\n‘Leading mineral economy’\n\nAddressing the forum, COAS Gen Asim Munir said Pakistan was poised to emerge as a leader in the global mineral economy. “I firmly believe that Pakistan is ready to take a leading role in the international mineral economy,” he said.\n\nWelcoming international institutions, he invited global stakeholders to bring their expertise to Pakistan, explore investment opportunities, and partner with us to develop the vast potential of our mineral resources.\n\nHe said there was a dire need for engineers, geologists, operators, and skilled miners to explore Pakistan’s mineral wealth. “That is why we are also sending students abroad for training to support the development of this sector,” he said.\n\nGen Munir said that currently as many as 27 Pakistani students belonging to Balochistan were receiving training in mineral exploration in Zambia and Argentina.\n\nThe COAS said economic security has now emerged as a vital component of national security.\n\nHe assured that the Pak Army would ensure a robust security framework and proactive measures to protect the interests and confidence of partners and investors.\n\nThe development of both upstream and downstream mineral industries in Pakistan will be ensured, he said.\n\nGen Munir stressed the importance of investing in refining and value addition in order to reduce costs and diversify markets in Pakistan. “With vast mineral reserves beneath our soil, skills in our hands and a transparent mineral policy in place, there is no room for despair or inaction,” he insisted.\n\nAcknowledging the contribution of the tribal elders of Balochistan, Gen Munir praised their role in promoting mining activities and fostering development and progress in the province. “Through collective efforts, Pakistan’s mineral sector can become a driver of regional development, prosperity and sustainability for the common good,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 9th, 2025",
