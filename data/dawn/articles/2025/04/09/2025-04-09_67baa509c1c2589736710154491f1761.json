He was arrested by US police in 2009.\n\nA US court in 2013 acquitted Rana of conspiracy to provide material support to the Mumbai attacks. But the same court convicted him of backing LeT to provide material support to a plot to commit murder in Denmark.\n\nRana was sentenced to 14 years for his involvement in a conspiracy to attack the offices of the Jyllands-Posten newspaper, which had published blasphemous caricatures of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).\n\nBut India maintains Rana is one of the key plotters of the Mumbai attacks along with the convicted Headley — and the authorities have welcomed his expected extradition.\n\nIn February, Devendra Fadnavis, chief minister of Maharashtra state which includes the megacity Mumbai, said that “finally, the long wait is over and justice will be done”.\n\nDevika Rotawan, a survivor of the Mumbai attacks, said she believed the extradition of Rana would be a “big win for India”.\n\n“I will never be able to forget the attack,” she told broadcaster NDTV on Wednesday.\n\nCounterterrorism experts however suggest Rana’s involvement was peripheral compared to Headley, a US citizen, who India also wants extradited.\n\n“They gave us a small fish but kept David Headley, so the essential outcome is going to be symbolic,” said Ajay Sahni, head of the Institute for Conflict Management, a New Delhi-based think tank.\n\nRana knew Headley, 64, from their days together at boarding school in Pakistan.\n\nHeadley, who testified as a government witness at Rana’s trial, said he had used his friend’s Chicago-based immigration services firm as a cover to scout targets in India, by opening a branch in Mumbai.\n\nRana has said he visited Mumbai ahead of the attacks — and stayed at the luxury Taj Mahal Palace Hotel that would become the epicentre of the bloody siege — but denied involvement in the conspiracy.\n\nSahni said that more than 16 years after the attacks, Rana’s extradition is of “historical importance” rather than a source of any “live intelligence”.\n\nBut he added that handing him over has “a chilling effect” on others abroad who India seeks to put on trial.",
