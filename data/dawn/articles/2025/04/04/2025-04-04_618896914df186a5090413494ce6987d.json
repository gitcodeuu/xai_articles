  "content": "WITH Balochistan in tumult, the political class needs to heal the province’s wounds with sagacity and far-sightedness. The need for security must be balanced with efforts to bring all those forces in Balochistan that believe in the constitutional process to the negotiating table and forge a path to peace based on reconciliation and confidence-building with the state.\n\nIn this regard, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while exchanging Eid greetings with the Balochistan chief minister in Lahore on Wednesday, reiterated that developing the province remained amongst his government’s top priorities, and that all efforts would be made to improve people’s lives. In a parallel development, the CM also made Eid visits to various political leaders of the province, including ex-Balochistan CM Abdul Malik Baloch. At the meeting CM Sarfraz Bugti welcomed “constructive proposals … to promote peace and development in the province”.\n\nMr Sharif and Mr Bugti have adopted the right approach, and though sceptics may say the state has come around to the idea of development and inclusivity a bit late in the day, one should remain optimistic, as the alternative is more violence. Development in the province is essential, and several past administrations have made similar promises to Balochistan. But holistic development can only work when there is organic and credible political activity in the province.\n\nReaching out to Dr Malik Baloch was the right step, and other Baloch leaders with credibility, such as Akhtar Mengal as well as the BYC, must be included in a wider outreach. In fact, political actors from across Pakistan must take the lead in engaging the democratic forces of Balochistan and earnestly addressing the woes of the province. There must be a commitment to respect the people’s political choices, along with an end to enforced disappearances and rights abuses in the province. Most importantly, both the civilian and the military arms of the state must endorse political outreach efforts to end the insurgency permanently.\n\nOf course, the militant threat in Balochistan cannot be dismissed. Those who engage in terrorism and threaten the security of Pakistan must be dealt with through kinetic measures. But if non-violent political and rights movements are forcefully crushed by the state, the insurgency will be difficult to quell. That is why the state must make a clear distinction between peaceful activists, and violent militants, and refrain from demonising the former. If the people are not allowed to peacefully air their grievances, it will only radicalise such movements, and push them into the arms of the separatists. Moreover, hostile foreign actors will also exploit these internal fault lines to stir up trouble. Therefore, the state can begin anew in Balochistan and push for peace, or continue down the same failed path.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 4th, 2025",
