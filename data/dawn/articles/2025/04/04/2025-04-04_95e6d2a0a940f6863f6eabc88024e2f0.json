They warned that if any untoward incident occu­rred during the march, the responsibility will lie entirely on the government and the relevant administration.\n\nMr Ibrahim Lehri recalled that JWP’s provincial presid­ent Nawabzada Gohram Bugti had given a 72-hour ultimatum to the government for the release of arrested women.\n\nIn a late-night developm­ent, police arrested Gohram Bugti from Dera Bugti. According to an official notification issued by the deputy commissioner, he was arrested under MPO-3 and shifted to Dera Bugti jail.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 4th, 2025",
