  "content": "LAHORE: The Multan police claimed to have arrested nine motorcyclists for doing a wheelie in various areas of the city during the Eid days.\n\nThe crackdown resulted to nine cases registered across different police stations, including Chehliak, Dolat Gate, and New Multan stations, under section 99-A of the Provincial Motor Vehicles Ordinance 1965.\n\nThe Section 99-A deems wheelie a serious offense, with violators facing potential imprisonment of up to six months, a fine of up to Rs 5,000, or both, as the act poses a significant threat to human life and property.\n\nMultan Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Sardar Mavarhan Khan said measures were taken to address wheelie and special squads were constituted to monitor and arrest motorcyclists doing a wheelie. “We will not allow anyone to take the law into their hands,” said the CTO Mr Khan.\n\nHe also appealed to parents to counsel their children and prevent them from indulging in such life-threatening activities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 4th, 2025",
