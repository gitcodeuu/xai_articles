Imports to the world’s largest consumer market now face an average duty of 22.5pc, up from 2.5pc last year.\n\nTrump said he would impose a 10pc baseline tariff on all imports to the United States and higher targeted duties on some of the country’s biggest trading partners, hammering goods from Italian coffee and Japanese whisky to sportswear made in Asia. The president claims the “reciprocal” tariffs are a response to barriers put on US goods.\n\nEconomists said the tariffs could reignite inflation, raise the risk of a US recession and boost costs for the average US family by thousands of dollars — a potential liability for Trump who campaigned on a promise to bring down the cost of living.\n\nSome of the highest increases fell on impoverished countries in Africa, but Canada and Mexico — which have free trade agreements with Washington — escaped the imposition of reciprocal tariffs.\n\nBut Madagascar — one of the poorest nations in the world with gross domestic product (GDP) per head of just over $500 —meanwhile faces a 47pc tariff on the modest $733 million of exports of vanilla, metals and apparel that it did with the US last year.\n\nThe bluntness of the formula as applied to economies which cannot afford to import much from the US inevitably leads to a high reciprocal tally: 50pc for Lesotho in Southern Africa, 49pc for Cambodia in Southeast Asia.\n\nBut the formula is also sowing confusion among rich countries. For the European Union (EU) it has produced a punitive tariff of 20pc — four times the 5pc which the World Trade Organization (WTO) calculates as the EU’s average tariff rate.\n\nCase against Pakistan\n\nAccording to figures released by the White House, Pakistan is being hit with a 29pc reciprocal tariff. This is apparently a response to the 58pc tariffs charged to the US, which also include “currency manipulation and trade barriers”.\n\nOfficials from the Ministry of Commerce told Dawn that they were still evaluating the impact of the tariffs increase on Pakistan’s exports, as the US is the leading export market for Pakistani textile products.\n\nAccording to the National Trade Estimate Report on Foreign Trade Barriers, released by the office of the US Trade Representative, Washington believes that despite the reduction of applied tariff rates since 2013, US companies have cited concerns that Pakistan has been imposing high tariff rates and, in some cases, additional duties, on products such as automobiles and finished goods.\n\nIn addition, Pakistan grants sector- and product-specific import duty exemptions, concessions, and protections through the promulgation of statutory regulatory orders (SROs), which can be issued without stakeholder consultation or providing importers time to ensure compliance.\n\nUnder non-tariff barriers, the USTR says the country permits the importation of certain goods only by the public sector or industrial consumers, but some imports require approvals from federal-level ministries.\n\nIn addition, the USTR notes, food and consumer product exporters have expressed concerns regarding a lack of uniformity in customs valuation in Pakistan that negatively affects American stakeholders.\n\nAlthough Pakistan has made gradual improvements toward better coordinating its intellectual property (IP) enforcement efforts and updating its IP laws, serious concerns remain, particularly in the area of enforcement, the document notes.\n\nIt also takes issue with measures such as moves by the government to promote data localisation, as well as the routine practice of blocking access to Internet services, mobile data, and social media platforms.\n\n“Although Pakistani law allows repatriation of profits, US and other companies continue to face bureaucratic hurdles repatriating profits, dividends, and royalties from Pakistan, generally coinciding with the government’s focus on stemming outflows of US dollars,” it notes.\n\n“Local franchises of US brands report limitations and extended delays in remitting funds to the United States as a result of SBP policies,” it says.\n\nIt also maintains that contract enforcement can be difficult for US and other foreign investors in Pakistan due to significant delays and lack of enforcement of court rulings.\n\nUSTR also notes that Pakistan has one of the lowest tax compliance and tax-to-GDP ratios in the world — 9pc in FY2024.\n\n“Pakistan relies heavily on multinational corporations for the revenue generated by tax collection. Foreign investors in Pakistan regularly report that both federal and provincial tax regulations are difficult to navigate, frequently citing the lack of transparency in the assessment of taxes,” it says.\n\nThe document also mentions corruption and a weak judicial system as substantial disincentives to foreign investment. While it mentions the National Accountability Bureau, it notes that “business and civil society stakeholders have expressed reservations about the body’s effectiveness and perceived politicisation”.\n\nBusinesses sound alarm\n\nBusinesses around the globe also faced up to a future of higher prices, trade turmoil and reduced access to the world’s largest market after Trump confirmed their worst fears.\n\nWTO chief Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned the measures would “have substantial implications for global trade and economic growth prospects”.\n\n“It clearly isn’t good news for (the) global economy, stability and trade,” Maersk, the world’s second-largest container shipping firm, said in a statement.\n\nWith input from AFP and Reuters\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 4th, 2025",
