  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Railways (PR) on Thursday unveiled a project to introduce state-of-the-art Diesel Multiple Unit (DMU) trains, a step towards modernising the infrastructure of country’s rolling stock.\n\nThe DMU trains will enhance passenger travel with modern, air-conditioned coaches and high-speed capability. These trains, designed to operate at a speed of up to 160 km/h, will be a game-changer for Pakistan’s railway network, particularly along the Lahore-Lalamusa-Rawalpindi section.\n\nA presentation on the project was given to Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi in Islamabad by senior officials of the ministry of railways. The project will be developed under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model, ensuring efficient operation and maintenance of the DMU fleet.\n\nThe investor will be responsible for 100 per cent investment, acquisition, and financing of rolling stock, compliance with regulations and payment of track access charges while Pakistan Railways will provide access to tracks, ensure operational oversight, and facilitate necessary approvals while focusing on the rehabilitation of railway tracks for smooth operation.\n\nThis initiative aligns with the government’s vision to modernise Pakistan’s railway sector and improve connectivity between key cities. The introduction of DMU trains will enhance commuter convenience, reduce travel time and contribute to the overall economic uplift of the region.\n\nThe DMU train has a seating capacity of 380 passengers and it is an air-conditioned rail car for a better and less time consuming travel experience. This initiative is part of Pakistan Railways commitment to improving railway services, ensuring efficient, comfortable, and reliable transportation for passengers.\n\nPakistan Railways intends to join hands with the Punjab government to facilitate economic growth and infrastructure development.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 4th, 2025",
