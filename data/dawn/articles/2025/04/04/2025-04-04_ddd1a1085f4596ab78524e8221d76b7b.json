The total relief will amount to around Rs6 per unit. After inclusion of tax, the relief will come to Rs7.41 per unit.\n\nPower Division officials said the prime minister’s decision to reduce electricity prices is subject to the economic situation.\n\nAs long as the economic situation remains stable, consumers will continue to receive relief, they added.\n\nThe officials further said that annual rebasing is not possible at this time, so relief is being provided through quarterly adjustments.\n\nThe officials told Nepra that the estimate for petroleum levy collections in the next three months is Rs58.7 billion.\n\nThey continued that relief is being provided in electricity consumers for three months in the form of the petroleum levy.\n\nThe officials informed the forum that in the second quarter adjustment, a relief of Rs12 billion has been provided through agreements with five independent power producer (IPPs).\n\nThey continued that so far, revision agreements have been made with 32 IPPs.\n\nThe officials further said talks with the International Monetary Fund are under way to reduce circular debt.\n\nThe relief will be provided to the public once the negotiations reach a final conclusion, they added.",
