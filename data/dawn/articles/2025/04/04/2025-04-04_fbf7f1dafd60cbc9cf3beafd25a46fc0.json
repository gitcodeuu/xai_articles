  "content": "The army’s upper echelon on Friday vowed to thwart the “nefarious designs” of foreign proxies and hostile internal actors, according to a statement from the military’s media wing.\n\nAccording to the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir chaired the 268th Corps Commanders’ Conference at General Headquarters (GHQ) in Rawalpindi today, where a “meticulous assessment” of regional and internal security dynamics was carried out.\n\n“The forum received a comprehensive briefing on the prevailing geostrategic environment, emerging national security challenges and Pakistan’s strategic response to evolving threats,” the ISPR said.\n\n“The forum reaffirmed its resolve to eradicate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations regardless of the cost … [and] reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to bringing the full force of the state against facilitators and abettors acting on the behest of hostile elements seeking to destabilise the country,” the statement added.\n\nAccording to the ISPR, the forum reaffirmed, “No one will be allowed to disrupt peace in Balochistan and [the] nefarious designs of foreign-sponsored proxies, including social disruptive elements and their so-called political supporters, advancing their narrow political interests at the cost of stability and prosperity of Balochistan will be decisively thwarted with the unwavering support of the people of Balochistan.\n\n“The real face of all foreign and domestic elements, the nexus between them and their endeavours to induce chaos and thrive on it stand fully exposed and will be dealt with without impunity,” the statement read.\n\nAccording to the statement, the forum underscored the importance of “a whole-of-the-nation” approach to countering terrorism. The meeting particularly emphasised the need to implement Vision Azm-e-Istehkam under the ambit of the NAP.\n\n“The state apparatus and institutions will resolutely implement the law within the confines of the Constitution and no leniency and infirmity will be shown,” the ISPR said.\n\nAccording to the statement, COAS lauded the initiation of District Coordination Committees across Pakistan and stressed the need for sustained, coordinated efforts to expedite the implementation of the NAP, in alignment with governmental directives, ensuring seamless inter-institutional collaboration.\n\n“[The] Pakistan Army will extend full support to the government and law enforcement agencies in enforcing stringent legal measures against illicit economic activities, which are intrinsically linked to the financing of terrorism,” COAS was quoted as saying. “There is no space for terrorists and their facilitators in Pakistan.”\n\nMilitant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March 2025, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS).\n\nThe think tank reported 105 militant attacks during the month, resulting in 228 fatalities, including 73 security personnel, 67 civilians, and 88 militants. Additionally, 258 people were injured, comprising 129 security personnel and civilians.\n\nLast month, Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) terrorists ambushed the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express train carrying 440 passengers, opening fire and taking hostages. Security forces launched a two-day operation, where ISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry confirmed that all 33 terrorists were neutralised, but no hostages were harmed in the final rescue phase.\n\nHe also said the incident had changed the “rules of the game”.\n\nExpressing deep concern over human rights violations in Indian-held Kashmir and the Indian Army’s “unprovoked ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC)”, the forum underscored “Pakistan’s deep and unwavering support to the just cause of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and the need of sustained diplomatic engagement to highlight ongoing human rights abuses and violations on the global stage,” the statement read\n\nThe forum also expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and condemned human rights violations and war crimes being perpetrated in Gaza by Israel. “The forum also reiterated unequivocal diplomatic, political and moral support to the people of Palestine,” the statement added.",
