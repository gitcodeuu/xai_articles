Seven opposition members left the House and an opposition member then pointed out the quorum leaving no space for the panel of chairman to maintain the quorum.\n\nSoon after treasury’s failure to maintain the quorum, the DCs were instructed to call and message the treasury MPAs to ensure their presence in Lahore for the passage of Nawaz Sharif Cancer Hospital Bill.\n\nA DC’s message sent to the treasury MPAs is titled as: “Presence of MPAs from Treasury Benches in Lahore for passage of the Nawaz Sharif Cancer Hospital Bill.”\n\nThe text says, “I am directed to convey that the Treasury Benches MPAs must be present in Lahore tomorrow (Tuesday), i.e., April 22, 2025, as the Nawaz Sharif Cancer Hospital Bill is scheduled to be processed in the Provincial Assembly”.\n\nThe message concludes as saying “You are requested to ensure your timely presence” and “Kindly acknowledge the message”.\n\nDuring the assembly session, treasury MPA Zulfiqar Shah expressed condolences on the passing of Pope Francis.\n\nHe stated, “We express our sorrows to the Catholic Christian community of Pakistan.”\n\nHe described Pope Francis as a great personality who played a role for interfaith harmony. MPA Ijaz Alam Augustine requested a special prayer in the House.\n\nSpeaker Khan led the House in observing one minute silence in remembrance of Pope Francis.\n\nThe House passed six bills amid low presence of lawmakers. These included The Walled City of Lahore (Amendment) Bill 2025, The Punjab Financial Advisory Services Bill 2025, The Punjab Finance (Amendment) Bill 2025, The Punjab Spatial Planning Authority Bill 2025, and The Punjab Energy Efficiency and Conservation Agency Bill 2025.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025",
