  "content": "SYLHET: Bangladesh ended the second day of the first Test against Zimbabwe trailing by only 25 runs after spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz took five wickets to restrict the visitors to 273 in their first innings in Sylhet on Monday.\n\nIt was a comeback for Bangladesh after a disappointing first day when skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto won the toss and decided to bat first.\n\nHowever, his batters failed to capitalise and were bowled out by an impressive Zimbabwe attack for a modest 191.\n\nZimbabwe then piled on the misery by racing to 67-0 by the end of play on the first day.\n\nStarting from a commanding position, both Zimbabwe openers fell early on the second day to aggressive pace bowling by Nahid Rana.\n\nBen Curran was the first to go on 18 and his partner Brian Bennett, who hit an aggressive 64-ball 57, was removed soon after with the score on 88-2.\n\nSean Williams (59) was the only other Zimbabwe batter to reach fifty.\n\nWessly Madhevere (24), Nyasha Mayavo (35) and Richard Ngarava (28) all failed to build bigger scores.\n\nOff-spinner Mehidy took the key wickets of Williams, May­avo and Ngarava to finish with 5-52 on a wicket that was expected to help the pace bowlers.\n\nNahid took 3-74 with aggressive bowling in support of Mehidy.\n\nStarting the second innings with an 82-run deficit, Bangladesh lost Shadman Islam on 4 to Blessing Muzarabani with the score on 13.\n\nHis opening partner Mahm­udul Hasan Joy soldiered on to 28 in an unbeaten 44-run partnership with Mominul Haque, on 15, to end the day at 57-1.\n\nShanto must now hope that they can make the most of the friendly home conditions to set an imposing target for the visitors.\n\nBangladesh have been formidable on the slow and spin-friendly home pitches but have several veterans missing.\n\nThey have won eight of the 18 Tests against Zimbabwe, their highest total against any Test side, including four of the past five.\n\nThe second and final Test will be played in Chattogram from April 28.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nBANGLADESH (1st Innings) 191\n\nZIMBABWE (1st Innings, overnight 67-0):\n\nB.
