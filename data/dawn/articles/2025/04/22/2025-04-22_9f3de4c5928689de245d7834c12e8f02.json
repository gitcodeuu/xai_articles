From January to November, 531 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.\n\nOut of the tally, 185 were men, while a total of 346 women were killed across the country.\n\nAccording to the tally, around 16 men were killed in Balochistan, one was killed in the capital, 32 were killed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 53 were killed in Punjab, and 83 were killed in Sindh in violence-related killings across the country.",
