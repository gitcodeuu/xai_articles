More than an hour later, he made a gesture of farewell to his ever-present nurse, Massimiliano Strappetti, and slipped into a coma, the Vatican’s official media channel said.\n\nHis time of death was given as 7:35am (10:35am PKT).\n\nThe Vatican released photographs of Francis dressed in his vestments and laid in a wooden coffin in the chapel of the Santa Marta residence, where he lived during his 12-year papacy. Swiss Guards stand on either side of the casket.\n\nHis body will be taken into the adjacent St. Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday morning at 9am (12pm PKT), in a procession led by cardinals, allowing the faithful to pay their last respects to the first Latin American pope.\n\nHis funeral service will be held in St. Peter’s Square, in the shadow of the Basilica, on Saturday at 10am (1pm PKT).\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who clashed repeatedly with the pope about immigration, said he and his wife would fly to Rome for the service.\n\nAmong other heads of state set to attend were Javier Milei, president of Francis’s native Argentina, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, according to a source in his office.\n\nCatholic Christians in Karachi were saddened to learn of the passing of Pope Francis.\n\n“The Catholic Board has announced a holiday for Tuesday as a day of mourning. And on the day of his funeral, there will be another holiday,” said Reverend Father Mario Angelo Rodrigues.\n\nIn a break from tradition, Francis confirmed in his final testament released on Monday that he wished to be buried in Rome’s Basilica of Saint Mary Major and not St. Peter’s, where many of his predecessors were laid to rest.\n\nFrancis’s sudden death has set in motion ancient rituals, as the 1.4-billion-member church started the transition from one pope to another, including the breaking of the pope’s “Fisherman’s Ring” and lead seal, used in his lifetime to seal documents, so they cannot be used by anyone else.\n\nAll cardinals in Rome were summoned to a meeting on Tuesday to decide on the sequencing of events in the coming days and review the day-to-day running of the church in the period before a new pope is elected.\n\nA conclave to choose a new pope normally takes place 15 to 20 days after the death of a pontiff, meaning it should not start before May 6.\n\nSome 135 cardinals are eligible to participate in the secretive ballot, which can stretch over days before white smoke pouring from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel tells the world that a new pope has been picked.\n\nAt present, there is no clear frontrunner to succeed Francis.\n\nDeath should not be seen as the end of life but as the beginning of eternity, Pope Francis said in words he wrote only days before his final hospitalisation in the preface to a book due to be published this week.\n\n“Death is not the end of everything, but the beginning of something. It is a new beginning … because eternal life, which those who love already begin to experience on earth, is the beginning of something that will never end,” Francis wrote in the book on old age by Italian cardinal Angelo Scola.\n\n“For this reason, that (death) is a ‘new’ beginning, because we will live something we have never fully lived before: eternity,” he added.\n\nFrancis had repeatedly said during his pontificate that death was not a topic that should be avoided.\n\nIn a message to young people gathering in Mexico City in 2019, he said “the question of death is the question of life”, emphasising that facing the topic helped people to truly appreciate the value of life.\n\nPope Francis inherited a Church in disarray and worked hard to overhaul the Vatican’s central administration, root out corruption and, after a slow start, confront the scourge of child abuse within the ranks of the priesthood.\n\nHe often clashed with conservatives, nostalgic for a traditional past, who saw Francis as overly liberal and too accommodating to minority groups, such as the LGBTQ community.\n\nFrancis appointed nearly 80pc of the cardinal electors scattered across the world who will choose the next pope, increasing, but not guaranteeing, the possibility that his successor will continue his progressive policies.\n\nOne of the hallmarks of Francis’ reign was his decision to appoint cardinals to far-flung regions — places where Roman Catholics make up a tiny minority or where the Church is growing faster than in the mostly stagnant West.\n\nWhile Europe still has the largest share of cardinal electors, with about 39 per cent, it is down from 52pc in 2013, when Francis became pope. The second largest group of electors is from Asia and Oceania, with about 20pc.\n\nMany of the cardinals are little known outside their own countries and they will have a chance to get to know one another at meetings known as General Congregations that take place in the days before a conclave starts, and where a profile of the qualities needed for the next pope will take shape.",
