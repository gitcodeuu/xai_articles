The federal government, with the support of provincial governments and organisations like JFF, is working to promote and strengthen MMS and remains committed to playing its part.”\n\nIt said that Mashood appreciated the “support of JFF and other development partners for assisting both federal and provincial governments in this vital area”.\n\nJFF Chairman Ansir Junaid expressed “personal gratitude for the many partners and individuals involved in supporting the MMS initiative”, reiterating the foundation’s commitment to improving maternal health.\n\n“The health of a nation begins with the health of its mothers. At JFF, we believe that every mother deserves the opportunity to thrive, and every child deserves the chance to be born healthy,” the JFF chairman was quoted as saying.\n\n“We are honoured to stand beside our partners and the government of Pakistan in building a future where maternal nutrition is a right, not a privilege.”\n\nJFF Senior Technical Advisor Dr Abdul Ghaffar recounted the history of “how JFF got involved in the MMS initiative in 2019 in Pakistan, and has since become a central part of the JFF mission”.\n\nHe emphasised the need for more coordinated and multi-sectoral efforts to strengthen maternal nutrition, the press release said.\n\nHe also shared that in 2024, JFF in partnership with US NGO Kirk Humanitarian donated over one million bottles of MMS for distribution across thirty-two high-burden districts in Pakistan.\n\nJFF Executive Director Jackie Range said that the foundation was “deeply committed to serving vulnerable populations in the core areas of healthcare, education, civic engagement and equity and diversity both in Cleveland, Ohio and in Pakistan”.\n\n“It is important to recognise the sheer scale of this effort. To properly serve and sustain women in a country of this size, it is imperative to have seamless coordination between philanthropy, government, and NGO’s. Today’s seminar is a shining reflection of what is possible with such collaboration,” she was quoted as saying.\n\nDeputy Representative of UNICEF, Shameela Rasool, also appreciated the role of JFF for bringing all together.",
