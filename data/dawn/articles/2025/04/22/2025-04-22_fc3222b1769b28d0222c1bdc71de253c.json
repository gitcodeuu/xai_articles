Al-Meshari, its senior vice president of Techno­logy Oversight and Coordination.\n\nLuo Hongbin, BYD senior vice president, said “SATC and our cutting-edge R&D capabilities in new energy vehicles will break the boundaries of geography and mindset to incubate solutions that combine highly-efficient performance with a lower carbon footprint.” Saudi Arabia is working to diversify its economy, which is dependent on oil export revenue, and wants to set up 5,000 EV charging stations by 2030.\n\nThe Saudi sovereign wealth fund holds a 60 percent stake in the California luxury EV maker Lucid and has signed an agreement with Hyundai of South Korea to build an electric and thermal vehicle factory in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025",
