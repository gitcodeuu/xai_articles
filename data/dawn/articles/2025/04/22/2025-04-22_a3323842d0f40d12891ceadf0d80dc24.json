I also have to stress that in the last year or two things have been moving faster than they have for a while,” Al Nahyan said during the meeting. He emphasised the shared commitment to advancing cooperation in sectors aligned with the developmental priorities of both countries.\n\nEconomic cooperation has been a cornerstone of this growing relationship. Bilateral trade surpassed $10.9 billion in fiscal year 2023-24, bolstered by agreements signed in January 2024 worth more than $3bn. These deals focused on railway development, special economic zones, and port infrastructure.\n\nRemittances from the Pakistani diaspora in the UAE, numbering around 1.8 million, reached $6.7bn in 2024 and are projected to exceed $7bn in 2025. The UAE’s $10bn investment pledge in May 2024 targets key sectors including energy, trade, and infrastructure. Both sides also plan to deepen cooperation in information technology, tourism, and development.\n\nThe talks concluded with the signing of two memoranda of understanding and one agreement. Al Nahyan and Ishaq Dar signed an MoU establishing a Joint Consular Affairs Committee and an agreement to strengthen cultural cooperation. The two ministers also witnessed the exchange of an MoU to establish a UAE-Pakistan Joint Business Council.\n\nLater in the day, Al Nahyan called on Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, with Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir also in attendance.\n\nPM Shehbaz welcomed the positive trajectory of the bilateral relationship and called for enhanced cooperation in trade, investment, energy, and people-to-people exchanges. He reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to transforming the strong political ties with the UAE into a robust economic partnership.\n\nAl Nahyan, in his meeting with PM Shehbaz, reaffirmed the UAE’s resolve to deepen bilateral ties and explore new avenues for collaboration.\n\nISI Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik was also present during meeting.\n\nTraining of diplomats\n\nPakistan and Rwanda signed a memorandum of understanding to enhance cooperation in the training of diplomats.\n\nThe agreement was signed during a meeting between Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Rwanda’s Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation, Olivier Nduhungirehe, who is currently on an official visit to Pakistan.\n\nMr Dar expressed Pakistan’s commitment to deepening friendly relations with Rwanda, particularly in trade, investment, and educational exchanges.\n\nThe two sides also discussed opportunities for broader collaboration and emphasised the importance of institutional linkages between their foreign services.\n\nThe MoU on diplomatic training between the foreign ministries of both countries was signed on this occasion.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025",
