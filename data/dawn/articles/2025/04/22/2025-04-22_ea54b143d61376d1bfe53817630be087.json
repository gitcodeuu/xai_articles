  "content": "RAHIM YAR KHAN:The construction of a petrol pump on the front lawn of the Model City A-Division Police Station, located at the Main City Bridge Chowk on Shahi Road, has sparked a widespread public criticism on social media due to the uprooting of century-old trees.\n\nAccording to police sources, three prime locations in the district have been leased for petrol pumps by the police department under a welfare initiative for police employees. These include the front lawn of the City A-Division Police Station, a location on Abu Dhabi Road within police lines, and a site outside the City Police Station Liaquatpur.\n\nDistrict President of the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party, Rana Raheel Ahmed Khan, voiced his concerns on social media, alleging that the district police officer (DPO) of Rahim Yar Khan leased out valuable land in front of the police station for a low amount.\n\nHe highlighted that both the police station building and the trees that were removed were over 100 years old. In a meeting with local traders, Khan said they were willing to pay Rs2 million to Rs3m per month in rent for the same land — suggesting that it could be used for other public-benefiting projects instead of a petrol pump.\n\nKhan questioned the safety implications of building a petrol station in such a central and sensitive location and demanded transparency by making the lease agreement public.\n\nOtherwise, he warned, he would take legal action. He further alleged that the lease was awarded to a close associate of the DPO, who is also allegedly involved in the Iranian oil trade. He pledged to raise the issue with the prime minister, chief minister, and Federal Minister Abdul Aleem Khan.\n\nPolice spox defends employees’ welfare project amid social media backlash\n\nEnvironmental activist Mirza Usman criticised the move, calling it a matter of public interest and urging the DPO to publicly address the concerns. He condemned the cutting of heritage trees and questioned the role of the relevant environmental departments in the approval process.\n\nLocal journalist Noor Muhammad Soomro also raised the issue on Facebook, questioning why the front area of the police station worth billions was leased for a petrol pump when a commercial plaza could have generated Rs50m to Rs60m in monthly rent.\n\nAnother citizen, Sajjad Aslam, said on inquiring about the municipal approval for the petrol pump’s design, the Municipal Committee (MC) informed him that a notice had been issued to the owners. Despite this, construction continued at the site.\n\nWhen contacted, Deputy Director of the Environmental Protection Department, Aamir Rehmani, said Assistant Director Suraj Kumar would provide further details about the project’s environmental approvals. MC District Officer Planning Umar Awais confirmed that a notice (MC-RYK/MO(P)/3063 dated April 19, 2025 had been issued to the petrol pump owners, instructing them to produce a No Objection Certificate (NOC) or halt construction. Copies of the notice were also sent to the deputy commissioner, ADCG, and the chief officer of MC RY Khan.\n\nIn response to the controversy, police spokesperson Saif Ali Wains clarified that the lease agreements were finalised through a transparent process involving public advertisement and competitive bidding, in line with PPRA rules. He said the initiative was launched by the Punjab inspector general of police (IGP) to support the welfare and education of families of martyred police personnel.\n\nWains also assured that the police station’s operations would not be disrupted.\n\n“A separate entrance has been arranged from the back of the General Post Office, and a new elevation and entrance have been completed to maintain public access,” he said.\n\nHe dismissed the social media criticism as baseless, saying that the process was conducted on merit.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025",
