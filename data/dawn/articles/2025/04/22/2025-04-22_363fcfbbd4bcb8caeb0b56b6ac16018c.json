He said the relief of Rs8bn was provided to customers since the inception of Banking Mohtasib Pakistan in 2005.\n\nWhile releasing the Annual Report 2024, he said the number of complaints lodged with the BMP against commercial banks during 2024 increased by 6pc over the preceding year.\n\nMr Aziz said that newly established digital banks have also been placed under the ambit of BMP, which requires additional measures, besides more staff who should be fully equipped with Fintech operations and related technologies. Banks’ efforts to meticulously educate the public through electronic and print media to protect them from frauds and forgeries have failed to bring effective results, he remarked, while urging redoubling their efforts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025",
