  "content": "LAHORE: The law minister said he did not see any need for another constitutional amendment in the current scenario, following the promulgation of the 26th Amendment.\n\nHowever, he said that no one could predict the future and if the need arose, a fresh amendment may be introduced.\n\nAzam Nazeer Tarar expressed these views after inaugurating a two-day training session on arbitration for lawyers, organised by the International Mediation & Arbitration Centre (IMAC), Ministry of Law & Justice at the Punjab Bar Council (PbBC).\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the event, the minister said that any future amendment would only be made with consensus among all coalition partners.\n\n“At present, there is no such proposal,” he said.\n\nOn the issue of violent attacks on state institutions, the minister said: “If public property is set ablaze and military installations are attacked, those responsible cannot be welcomed with garlands.”\n\nCommenting on the financial grant given to the Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Senator Tarar said it would be more appropriate if the KP government invested in its own judicial system.\n\nHe rejected the claim of the opposition that the law was being violated and insinuated that they were the ones getting undue favours.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 22nd, 2025",
