Moreover, if that is the case why did Salman Akram Raja meet Imran Khan (on March 25) while Aleema Khan and other sisters were not allowed to meet their brother,” he said.\n\n“I am the chairman of Pakistan’s largest political party and have confidence of Imran Khan. I am facing criticism for last one and half years and I appreciate positive criticism but no one should do it for cheap popularity,” he said.\n\n“…the party has not decided that if one lawyer’s name is removed from the list provided to the Adiala administration, others lawyers will not meet Imran Khan either. Moreover, we have not decided that if Imran Khan’s sisters will not be allowed, no lawyer will meet Mr Khan,” he said.\n\nHe said the boycott happened only once and that too at the time of the 26th Amendment. “We had provided a list of five lawyers in which Salman’s name was also included, but when we received the approval, there were names of three lawyers and Salman’s name was missing. We decided that either all five would go there or none of us would. The government was of the view that Salman’s name was not included because he was not a parliamentarian…,” he explained.\n\nBanister Gohar said that the political committee never took such a decision after that, adding that the proposal could be tabled in front of the political committee and if it decided in its favour, then no one would meet Imran Khan if his sisters’ access was restricted.\n\n“However, political point-scoring should not be done, and no one should try to gain cheap popularity. No one should speak about Ali Zafar that he is a ‘favourite’ person. He is great person…(he) contested party cases in the Peshawar High Court, the IHC, the Lahore High Court, the Supreme Court, the Election Commission and at other forums without charging even a single rupee,” he claimed.\n\nParliamentary party meeting\n\nLater, after the meeting of the PTI parliamentary party, leader of the opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan said that the Pakistan Peoples Party was responsible for the canals which are being made in Punjab. “In July last year a meeting was called in which President Asif Zardari gave approval for the canals under SIFC,” he alleged.\n\n“However, it is the PTI which has raised the issue and said that the water belongs to Sindh and issue should be addressed through Council of Common Interests,” he said.\n\n“Moreover, a mineral conference was held in Islamabad, but I need to tell that the investment comes to those places where peace prevails. We are being told that the cases against PTI can be withdrawn if Imran Khan seeks an apology. It shows that all cases are politically motivated,” he claimed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 10th, 2025",
