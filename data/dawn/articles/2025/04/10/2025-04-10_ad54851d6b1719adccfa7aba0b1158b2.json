  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan and Scotland emerged victorious in their respective encounters on the opening day of the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifier at the Gaddafi Stadium and LCCA Ground, respectively, here on Wednesday.\n\nPakistan’s impressive bowling attack, spearheaded by pacer Diana Baig (4-35) and supported by left-arm spinners Nashra Sandhu (3-41) and Sadiq Iqbal (2-33), guided them to a comfortable 38-run win over Ireland. The trio shared nine wickets, with the pitch providing assistance to both pace and spin bowlers.\n\nMeanwhile, Scotland pulled off a stunning 11-run win over the West Indies, despite a valiant century (114 not out) from West Indies captain and all-rounder Hayley Matthews, who also claimed four wickets in a brilliant individual effort.\n\nIreland’s captain Gaby Lewis won the toss and elected to field, allowing Pakistan to bat first. The decision seemed to backfire as Pakistan’s middle-order, led by Sidra Amin (51) and Aliya Riaz (52), along with a solid opening partnership from Muneeba Ali (32), posted a challenging total of 217 in 49 overs.\n\nIn reply, Ireland’s chase fell short as they were bowled out for 179 in 44 overs. Diana and Nashra tore through the Irish batting line-up. Diana claimed four wickets, with most coming from the lower order, while Nashra’s spell included two key dismissals: Lewis (44) and Amy Hunter (44), who had shared a partnership of 69 runs.\n\nNashra’s pivotal breakthrough came in the 30th over when she reduced Ireland from 96-3 to 119-4, dismissing Lewis lbw, and followed it up by clean bowling Hunter and Laura Delany. Sadiq then claimed two wickets, while Diana mopped up the lower order, removing Arlene Kelly and Louise Little (10), as Ireland’s hopes faded. A final run-out by Fatima Sana and Nashra sealed the victory with Ireland being dismissed six overs before the allotted 50.\n\nEarlier, Pakistan’s batting had seen some steady contributions. After the early loss of debutant Gull Feroza (four), Muneeba and Sidra Amin steadied the ship, putting on a 77-run partnership. Muneeba’s dismissal, however, led to a quick collapse as Sidra and Aliya Riaz were both dismissed in quick succession. Despite this, Pakistan reached 217, with Jane Maguire (3-33), Arlene Kelly (2-34), and Cara Murray (2-49) being the main wicket-takers for Ireland.\n\nSCOTLAND OVERCOME MATTHEWS’ HEROICS\n\nAt the LCCA Ground, the West Indies opted to field first but could not contain Scotland’s batters, who posted a total of 244 in 45 overs. Sarah Bryce (55) and Megan McColl (45) were the top scorers, while the West Indies’ Matthews, despite taking four wickets, could not halt the Scottish charge.\n\nThe West Indies made early inroads, with Matthews removing Scotland’s openers Abbie Aitken-Drummond (21) and Darcey Carter (25) in quick succession. However, a resolute partnership of 82 runs between Bryce and McColl stabilised the innings. Matthews eventually broke the partnership by dismissing Bryce at 182-5, but McColl was later run out for 45, leaving Scotland at 244.\n\nIn response, Matthews carried the West Indies’ hopes with an exceptional knock. Battling cramps and physical exhaustion, Matthews faced 113 balls, hitting 14 fours and a six. She was joined by Zaida James (45), whose steady knock included five fours and a six. However, after Matthews’ century, she was forced to retire due to injury and returned to bat after being stretchered off.\n\nDespite Matthews’ heroics, the West Indies fell short. A late flurry of wickets, including Matthews’ own return to the crease, couldn’t prevent the inevitable. Matthews’ efforts fell just short as the West Indies were all out for 233 in the 47th over, losing by 11 runs. Matthews’ knock was the ninth ODI century of her career.\n\nFor Scotland, Katherine Fraser (3-50) was the standout bowler, supported by Chloe Abel (2-31) and Abtaha Maqsood (2-60).\n\nScores in brief:\n\nPakistan beat Ireland by 38 runs.\n\nPAKISTAN 217in 49 overs (Sidra Amin 51, Aliya Riaz 52, Muneeba Ali 32; Jane Maguire 3-33; Cara Murray 2-49, Arlene Kelly 2-34); IRELAND 179 in 44 overs (G. Lewis 44, A. Hunter 44, O. Prendergast 37; Diana Baig 4-35, Nashra Sandhu 3-41, Sadia Iqbal 2-33)\n\nScotland beat West Indies by 11 runs.\n\nSCOTLAND 244 in 45 overs (S. Bryce 55, M. McColl 45, D. Carter 25, K. Fraser 25; H. Matthews 4-56, A. Alleynce 2-31, K. Ramharack 2-46); WEST INDIES 233 in 46.2 overs (H. Matthews 114 not out; Zaida James 45; Katherine Fraser 3-50, Chole Abel 2-31, Abtaha Maqsood 2-60).\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 10th, 2025",
