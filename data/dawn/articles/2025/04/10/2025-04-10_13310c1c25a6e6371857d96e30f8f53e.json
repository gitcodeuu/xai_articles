The United States, Qatar and Egypt brokered a fragile ceasefire whose first phase took effect on January 19.\n\nThe ceasefire lasted until March 18, with Israel resuming intense air strikes on Gaza.\n\nThe truce had allowed the return of 33 Israeli prisoners, eight of whom were dead, in exchange for the release of some 1,800 Palestinians held in Israeli jails.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 10th, 2025",
