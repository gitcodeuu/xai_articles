In May 2024, Ireland, Norway and Spain announced recognition, followed by Slovenia next month, in moves partly fuelled by condemnation of Israel’s brutal action in Gaza.\n\nMacron said such recognition would allow France “to be clear in our fight against those who deny Israel’s right to exist — which is the case with Iran — and to commit ourselves to collective security in the region.”\n\nA formal recognition by Paris would be a major policy shift and risk antagonising Israel and US.\n\nFrance’s recognition of Palestinian statehood “would be a step in the right direction in line with safeguarding the rights of Palestinians and the two-state solution,” Palestinian state minister for foreign affairs Varsen Shahin said.\n\nIn Egypt, Macron held summit talks with President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Jordan’s King Abdullah II and also made clear he was strongly opposed to any displacement or annexation in Gaza and the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has suggested turning Gaza into the “Riviera of the Middle East” with the Palestinians moving elsewhere — a suggestion that has sparked bitter condemnation. Macron responded the Gaza Strip was “not a real estate project”. “Simplistic thinking sometimes doesn’t help,” he added, and, in a message to Trump said “our responsibility is to save lives, restore peace, and negotiate a political framework. If all this doesn’t exist, no one will invest. Today, no one will invest a cent in Gaza.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 10th, 2025",
