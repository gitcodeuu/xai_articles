  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The police have not yet started legal proceedings in a road accident case involving an underage son of an aide to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister despite instructions from the Prime Minister’s Office issued last month, Dawn has learnt.\n\nSources said the PM’s Office had issued the instruction on March 22 to the Islamabad police to investigate the complaint filed by a citizen named Wahab Qayyum with the Prime Minister’s Performance Delivery Unit’s Pakistan Citizen’s Portal (PCP).\n\nThe complainant told Dawn that he had filed the complaint with the PM’s Office after the police refused to even receive his application for registration of a case regarding the road accident that occurred on March 16. According to him, his subsequent visit to City SP Khalid Awan also proved futile.\n\nIn his complaint, Wahab has stated that he was going towards D-Chowk in his newly purchased Hyundai Tucson when an overspeeding white Vigo hit his vehicle from behind and sped away. He immediately called the police helpline, and the vehicle was eventually intercepted by the Dolphin officials on Nazimuddin Road. The driver informed the police that he was the son of a KP adviser.\n\nOn March 27, he lodged another complaint with the DIG operations, alleging that soon after the accident, the father of the boy, who was driving Vigo, had arrived on the scene in a government vehicle with four to five people and allegedly coerced him into signing a settlement in the presence of the police officials and gave him Rs500,000 to cover the damages, while the estimated cost of the damage was about Rs1.4 million, the complaint added.\n\nHe requested the DIG to issue instructions to the SP City and the Kohsar SHO for an FIR against the underage driver.\n\nA police officer told Dawn that after receiving instructions from the top, the police called both the parties, but only the complainant arrived, and the other party did not show up. He said they would call them again, and if they did not come, the SOPs would be followed.\n\nDirector General Safe City Shakir Dawar, who has the acting charge of DIG operations, was contacted for comments, but he did not respond.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 10th, 2025",
