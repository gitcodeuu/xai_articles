  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Senator Sherry Rehman on Wednesday expressed concern over unprecedented water crisis in the Indus River system which is experiencing a historic 100-year low.\n\nIn an urgent call to action, the former climate change minister stressed that the situation is now a national emergency and it must not be politicised.\n\n“The Indus River is drying up before our eyes,” warned Senator Rehman, who heads the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change and Env­ironmental Coordination.\n\n“Rainfall has dropped by 40pc due to accelerating climate change. The Sukkur Barrage is experiencing a 71pc decline in water levels, while overall shortages across all three barrages have reached 65pc. These are staggering numbers,” she said.\n\nMs Rehman criticised the current response to the crisis, pointing out that instead of conserving the rapidly depleting water resources, canal extractions were being carried out which is further draining the Indus water.\n\nCalling for immediate and united national action, the PPP leader said her party would not compromise on the people’s right to water.\n\n“We need urgent coordination between provinces and the federation. The PPP has always stood for the rights of the people, and it will fight for their access to this vital resource,” she said.\n\nShe urged the federal government to declare the water shortage a climate emergency and urged the federal government to urgently convene the CCI meeting to address the serious water issue.\n\n“This is not the time for blame-game. Climate change is the enemy — not each other.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 10th, 2025",
