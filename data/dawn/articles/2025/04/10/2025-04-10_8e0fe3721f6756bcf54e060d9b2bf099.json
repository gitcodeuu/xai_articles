These were followed by a delegation-level meeting.\n\nOther MoUs signed on the occasion covered cooperation in e-commerce, science and technology, accreditation, auditing, vocational education, health services, and halal trade.\n\nThe two countries also agreed to collaborate on intelligence sharing related to money laundering and terrorism financing, customs statistics on bilateral trade, international road transport, and disaster management.\n\nAdditionally, agreements were reached on environmental and climate change cooperation, along with an extradition treaty to bolster legal frameworks.\n\nA joint communique issued at the end of the visit emphasised the significance of these agreements, stating that they are “expected to open new prospects for the continued development of bilateral relations based on the principles of mutually beneficial friendship.”",
