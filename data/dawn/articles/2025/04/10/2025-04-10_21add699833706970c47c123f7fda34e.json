He said those apprehended were so dangerous that placing them before ordinary courts will endanger the lives of the judges and their families.\n\nLater, senior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed on behalf of the Defence Ministry argued that military courts were legitimately constituted courts.\n\nHe said military courts were not subordinate to the high court in terms of Articles 202 and 203, adding that these courts do not fall within the framework of Article 175. In other words, he argued, military courts were not part of the judicature and they were also not courts with respect to which any writ could be issued under Article 199, including the writ for enforcement of fundamental rights other than in cases where the acts impugned are coram non judice, without jurisdiction or mala fide.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 10th, 2025",
