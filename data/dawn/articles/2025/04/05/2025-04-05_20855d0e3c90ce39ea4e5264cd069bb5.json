In the hours that followed, additional rescue and aid teams searching for their colleagues were also struck in a series of attacks.\n\nAccording to the Red Crescent, the convoy had been dispatched in response to emergency calls from civilians trapped under bombardment in Rafah.\n\nIn the video, a medic recording the scene can be heard reciting the Islamic profession of faith, the shahada, which Muslims traditionally say in the face of death.\n\n“There is no God but Allah, Muhammad is his messenger,” he says repeatedly, his voice trembling with fear as intense gunfire continues in the background.\n\nHe is also heard saying: “Forgive me mother because I chose this way, the way of helping people.”\n\nHe then says: “Accept my martyrdom, God, and forgive me.”\n\nJust before the footage ends, he is heard saying “The Jews are coming, the Jews are coming”, referring to Israeli soldiers.\n\nSeconds later, a male voice is heard speaking in Hebrew without a foreign accent. “Wait, we’re coming. We’re not responsible — you are responsible,” the voice says. The identity of the speaker and who he is addressing are unclear.\n\nThe deaths of the aid workers sparked international condemnation.\n\nJonathan Whittall, the head of OCHA in the Palestinian territories, said the bodies of the humanitarian workers were “in their uniforms, still wearing gloves” when they were found.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Turk, condemned the attack, saying it raised concerns about possible “war crimes” by the Israeli military.\n\n“I am appalled by the recent killings of 15 medical personnel and humanitarian aid workers, which raise further concerns over the commission of war crimes by the Israeli military,” Turk told the UN Security Council on Thursday.\n\nAn Israeli military official said the bodies had been covered “in sand and cloth” to protect them until arrangements could be made with international organisations for their retrieval.",
