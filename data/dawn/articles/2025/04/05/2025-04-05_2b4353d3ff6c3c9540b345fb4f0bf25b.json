  "content": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: The Sapat Sindhu Salhaar, a Seraiki literary organisation, staged its annual awareness rally, calling for the protection of the River Indus on Friday.\n\nThe rally featured traditional drum beats and folk dance jhumar, with participants marching from Imamia Gate to the riverbank.\n\nParticipants carried flower baskets and performed symbolic acts against littering, like scattering petals into the river.\n\nPoets, writers, students, teachers, journalists, activists and concerned citizens joined the event in large numbers.\n\nThe event began with a stirring rendition of the Seraiki anthem, followed by poetry recitations celebrating the River Indus. It was held to raise awareness about pollution caused by sewage and chemical dumping into the Indus, which is harming aquatic life and degrading the river’s ecological integrity.\n\nPatron of Arbab-i-Danish Forum Gulzar Ahmad said elected representatives must consult local intellectuals when addressing environmental and social issues.\n\nProf Habib Mohana emphasised the use of modern technology to clean and preserve the river.\n\nProf Arif said the human obsession with overpowering nature had caused the river to dry up.\n\n“The key to its revival lies in returning to harmony with nature and even Europe is now rethinking its industrial approach to the environment,” he said.\n\nSeraiki leader Mouz Arain said it was more than a protest; it was a movement to save the Indus from pollution.\n\n“By offering flowers, we symbolize our respect and responsibility toward this great river.”\n\nSenior journalist and president of Arbab-i-Danish Forum Abu Al-Muazzam Turabi said the Seraiki people must pursue education, technology, and awareness to achieve regional prosperity and protect their environment.\n\nOther speakers included Dr Qaiser Bhatti, Bilal Awan, Umair Saleem Sanwal, Tahir Shirazi, Abdul Razzaq, Taimoor Ali, Dr Aftab Awan, Shumail Mohana, Prof Jahanzaib, Raamish Ali, Ramzan Shori, Ramzan Kawish, Ramzan Haibat and Mohammad Akram Raasti.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 5th, 2025",
