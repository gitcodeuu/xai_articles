The solar plant, located in the island’s northeastern Trincomalee district, had been stalled for years but was reinvigorated with New Delhi’s backing.\n\nModi’s visit comes as Colombo grapples with the competing interests of New Delhi and Beijing. India has become concerned about China’s influence in Sri Lanka, which it sees as falling within its sphere of interest.\n\nDissanayake’s first foreign visit was to New Delhi in December, but he followed it with a visit to Beijing in January, underscoring Sri Lanka’s delicate balancing act.\n\nChina has emerged as Sri Lanka’s largest single bilateral creditor, accounting for more than half of its $14 billion bilateral debt at the time the island defaulted on its sovereign debt in 2022. Beijing was also the first to restructure its loans to Sri Lanka, a move that helped pave the way for the island to emerge from its worst economic meltdown.\n\nIn January, Colombo announced it had signed an agreement with a Chinese state-owned company to invest $3.7 billion in an oil refinery in the island’s south. The deal would mark Sri Lanka’s largest single foreign investment and is seen as crucial for its economic recovery.\n\nModi’s visit to Sri Lanka followed a summit in Thailand and a string of meetings with leaders of neighbouring nations as he sought to shore up India’s regional ties. On the sidelines of the Bangkok BIMSTEC meeting — the grouping of seven nations on the Bay of Bengal — Modi held a rare face-to-face meeting with Myanmar’s junta chief, Min Aung Hlaing.\n\nHe also held talks on Friday with the interim leader of Bangladesh, Muhammad Yunus — the first such meeting since a revolution in Dhaka ousted New Delhi’s long-time ally Sheikh Hasina and sent relations into a tailspin.\n\nIndia had been the biggest benefactor of Hasina’s government, and her overthrow prompted Yunus to make his first state visit last month to China. Modi also met on Friday in Bangkok with his Nepali counterpart, KP Sharma Oli — their first meeting since Oli returned to power last year — as well as Tshering Tobgay of Bhutan.",
