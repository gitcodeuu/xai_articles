We will fight against those who pit brother against brother.”\n\n“Terrorists today hide behind religion and nationalism, but in reality, they are just contract killers and pawns,” he added, citing recent terrorist incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\n\nHe asserted that the PPP was the first to raise concerns about water shortages. He cited IRSA reports and insisted that even Punjab’s farmers are suffering. He recalled that Benazir Bhutto had blocked a similar controversial water project, and Jahangir Badar had raised the issue from Lahore, while Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, then minister for water, had declared the plan dead.\n\nHe said the PPP Central Executive Committee (CEC) in its Dec 27 meeting in Islamabad had rejected unilateral decisions on water distribution.\n\n“I am a man of Mohenjo Daro. I live by the river and carry out cultivation,” he added, stressing the cultural and economic significance of the Indus River.\n\nCalling the four provinces brothers, Mr Bhutto-Zardari warned political and apolitical forces working against federal unity that PPP would resist them at every forum.\n\nHe added that PPP and PML-N had agreed to prepare the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) in consultation, showing a move towards cooperative governance.\n\n“PPP workers will stand with the flag of Pakistan. We must bury our differences for the sake of the country,” he said, adding that opposition parties must play a constructive role.\n\nEarlier, top PPP leaders including Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, PPP Sindh President Nisar Khuhro, Senator Rubina Khalid and Ijaz Jakhrani paid glowing tributes to Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, recalling his vision, reforms and sacrifices for the nation.\n\nA mushaira was also held, where poets from across the country recited verses in honour of Mr Bhutto’s legacy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 5th, 2025",
