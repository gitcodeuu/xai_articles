They do not want to weaken the struggle for the release of Imran Khan by inflaming the internal affairs of the party through unnecessary statements,” he said.\n\nMr Qaiser said: ’The chief minister should concentrate all his energies on the restoration of good governance and law and order in the province and the struggle for the release of Imran Khan and other innocent prisoners.“\n\nAlso, Mr Tarakai in a social media post demanded inquiry into the matter. He said he reserved the right to respond to the chief minister’s statement; however, he added, such a course of action would damage the party in the current situation.\n\nHe said all conspiracies would fail if they focus on strengthening the party and on release of the party founder.\n\n“All efforts to weaken Khan Sahib and the party will fail. A leader keeps people together, does not divide them for personal ego or desire,” Mr Tarakai said.\n\nHe maintained that their first goal was Mr Khan’s release.\n\nHowever, MNA Muhammad Atif Khan, president of party’s Peshawar region chapter, adopted a conciliatory tone. In a social media post, he denied making any statement against the chief minister.\n\n“Fake news is circulating regarding a statement associated to me, I haven’t given any response till now to Ali Amin,” Mr Khan noted in a post on X.\n\nPTI’s KP president MNA Junaid Akbar also in a social media post denied making any statement against speaker Babar Saleem Swati and CM Gandapur. He said reports circulating in this regard on social media were “fabricated”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 5th, 2025",
