  "content": "KARACHI: A firefighter tragically lost his life while trying to extinguish a blaze that broke out in a factory in Ahsanabad on Friday.\n\nRescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Khan told Dawn that 22-year-old Bilal Tanoli died in the line of duty as he had sustained critical head injuries when a heavy piece of machinery from the factory fell onto him.\n\nThe official explained that the blaze had erupted ostensibly due to some short circuit. Realising the gravity of the situation, firemen had declared it as a “third degree” fire, Mr Khan said, adding that over 20 fire tenders managed to control it after hectic efforts lasting for several hours.\n\nHowever, the fireman lost his life during the operation, he added.\n\nMr Khan said the three-storey building of the factory was also extensively damaged in the fire. He said their experts had declared it as a “dangerous building” that may collapse at any time as its structure had been weakened.\n\nMeanwhile, Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah extended his condolences and expressed sorrow over the firefighter’s sacrifice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 5th, 2025",
