New Delhi has not responded to Dhaka’s request to send her home for trial.\n\nThe two leaders discussed Bangladesh’s request seeking Hasina’s extradition, Misri said, without elaborating further.\n\n“She has consistently made false and inflammatory accusations against the interim government of Bangladesh,” the statement from Bangladesh quoted Yunus as saying.\n\nYunus requested New Delhi take appropriate measures to restrain Hasina from making incendiary remarks while she remained in India, said the statement, adding that Modi said India did not support any particular party in Bangladesh.\n\nIndia’s Misri said Modi had asked Yunus to help maintain border security and stability, and expressed his hope that Bangladesh would thoroughly investigate all cases of alleged atrocities “committed against non-Muslims”, including Hindus.\n\nIndia has repeatedly urged Bangladesh to “protect Hindus’, alleging they were being targeted since Yunus took charge. Dhaka says the violence has been exaggerated and is not a communal issue.\n\n“The hope would be that this meeting would start the process of rebuilding some engagement,” said Harsh Pant.\n\n“I think at this point, simply stabilising the relationship should be the priority.”\n\nWith longstanding cultural and business ties, the two nations share a 4,000km border.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 5th, 2025",
