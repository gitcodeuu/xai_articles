Will they be forced back?’\n\nAll four were supposed to fly in the first week of Feb, but the Trump order dashed their hopes. Afraid of going back to Afghanistan, one of the girls, Yasmine, recalled a traumatic encounter with a Taliban soldier in a bazaar.\n\n“I wasn’t wearing a mask and the Taliban pointed a gun at me asking me to wear it right there and then,” she says, referring to a face veil. “It was really hard, especially for women in Afghanistan,” she told Al Jazeera.\n\nAmina, a rights activist, told ABC about her escape from Afghanistan where she used to advocate for equal rights for women.\n\nBefore she fled, she spoke on a radio programme in Jalalabad about equal rights. ‘The next day, I was bombarded with phone calls, told I had committed blasphemy and should be punished’, ABC quoted her as saying. It said that days after the interview, her husband was attacked, forcing him to flee to Pakistan as well.\n\nBesides women and rights activists, another group which is particularly vulnerable to Taliban violence is those who worked with the US forces, but have now been seemingly abandoned by their ally. Touheed Khan told CNN that “in his time in the air force, ‘eight to 10’ of his colleagues were killed in ‘targeted explosions and shootings’ by the Taliban.”\n\nBut in its coverage, the Financial Times attempted to dig out the motive behind this expulsion drive. It quoted an anonymous diplomat who claimed that “declining international assistance was a significant point” in the move to increase deportations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
