  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has submitted a summary to the federal cabinet requesting the withdrawal of Federal Excise Duty (FED) on property transactions.\n\n“We will issue a notification after the cabinet approves the summary,” FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial told Dawn on Wednesday.\n\nIn the Finance Act 2024, the government has imposed 3 per cent FED on filers, 5pc on late filers and 7pc on non-filers. This levy is believed to have slowed down the transactions in the real estate sector.\n\nMr Rashid said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Shairf has already given a green signal for the FED withdrawal as the International Monetary Fund has not raised any objections to the move.\n\nFBR chairman says IMF has no objection to move\n\nHowever, the chairman said that he did not have the actual figures of the FED collection from the property transactions.\n\nReal estate experts predict a spike in market activity if the FED is abolished since it will make property transactions more affordable for buyers and sellers.\n\nThey further said that transfer prices are already high so that this relief will make a big difference.\n\nPeople hesitant to buy a home due to heavy taxation may feel more comfortable after FED removal, leading to more investment and stable property values in the next few months.\n\nThe FBR chairman stated that the notification would be issued shortly. The FED on property transactions is already in court because people have questioned it.\n\nRegarding revising the property valuation table for tax purposes, Mr Langrial stated that the valuation tables will be addressed following the budget. “We will not make any changes in the current fiscal year,” he asserted.\n\nCurrently, property transactions are subject to multiple taxes, including Capital Gains Tax (CGT), Capital Value Tax (CVT), Advance Tax (236C & 236K), and Urban Immovable Property Tax.\n\nThe CGT applies to profits from property sales, with rates varying for filers and non-filers.\n\nThe CVT is an annual tax on the fair market value of property. Advance tax is collected on sale and purchase, with higher rates for non-filers.\n\nThe Deemed Rental Income Tax (Section 7E) also assumes a notional rental income on properties exceeding Rs25 million, taxing it at 20pc.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
