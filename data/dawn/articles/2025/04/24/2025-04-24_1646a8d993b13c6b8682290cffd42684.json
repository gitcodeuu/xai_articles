  "content": "HYDERABAD: The Sindh government has recommended the name of a retired government official to the federal ministry of water resources for appointment as the ‘federal member from Sindh’ in the Indus River System Authority (Irsa).\n\nIrsa has four members from each province in addition to a federal member. Sindh had its federal member in Irsa 15 years ago when Bashir Ahmed Dahar served in the position between Oct 2007 and Oct 2010.\n\nThe name of retired chief engineer Shafqat Hussain Wadhu was okayed by Sindh Irrigation Secretary Zarif Khero and Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro last week.\n\nWith the approval from the Sindh chief minister, the official summary for his name is said to have been sent to the federal water ministry.\n\nMr Wadhu was recommended for a period of three years in pursuance of a Chief Executive Order issued by Gen Pervez Musharraf on July 10, 2000.\n\nThe Sindh High Court in its order passed on a petition on April 18, challenging the appointment of the incumbent ‘federal member’ in Irsa Asjad Imtiaz, observed that it was expected that before next date of hearing, a federal member from Sindh would be appointed as already had been decided by the court in its judgement on May 12, 2017 on a petition.\n\nMr Asjad has been serving on the position since October 2022 for yet another term.\n\nAccording to a source in Irsa, the summary for the appointment of the retired engineer was not allowed to be processed in the past. Resultantly, sitting federal member Asjad Imtiaz continued to hold the office.\n\nPPP Senator and Barrister Zamir Ghumro filed a writ of quo warranto before the SHC through Qurban Ali Maitlo, challenging Mr Asjad’s appointment and asked the court to declare his appointment illegal. The petitioner also challenged water availability certificate (WAC) issued by Irsa on Jan 25, 2024 for the Cholistan canal project. Upon which the court had passed an interim order suspending the certificate.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
