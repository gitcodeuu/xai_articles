Mr Kirmani defended the government’s actions, stating, “Politics is being played in the name of wheat,” but insisted that the government is committed to supporting farmers.\n\nHe criticised the opposition, questioning their record in provinces where they hold power and highlighting Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif’s personal involve­ment in monitoring the wheat market in Punjab.\n\nMr Kirmani detailed the government’s initiatives, including a record budget allocation for farmers, substantial subsidies on fertilisers, seeds, and tractors, and the disbursement of Rs52 billion in interest-free agricultural loans through the “Kissan Card.”\n\nHe highlighted the increased urea usage and a record wheat sowing as evidence of the government’s success. He also criticised the previous government, referring to it as “Waseem Akram Plus,” for neglecting the farmers’ welfare.\n\nA key focus of the government’s strategy is empowering the private sector, Mr Kirmani said, announcing Rs110bn in interest-free loans to the private sector and flour mills, mandating them to purchase 25pc of the wheat stock.\n\nHe also highlighted the implementation of Electronic Warehouse Receipts (EWR), enabling farmers to store wheat for up to four months and access immediate cash through bank loans using warehouse receipts.\n\nThe Punjab cabinet has further solidified its commitment by approving an amendment to the Food Grains Licensing Control Order 1957, mandating 25pc wheat procurement by flour mills, with the threat of license cancellation for non-compliance.\n\nThe cabinet also approved the implement­ation of EWR, with the government bearing storage costs, to provide farmers with greater flexibility and financial security.\n\nMinister Kirmani concluded by stating that wheat procurement will commence from all locations to help stabilise prices and ensure farmers receive their due compensation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
