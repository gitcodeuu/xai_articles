  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In a bid to support routine vaccination, Unicef has handed over 31 refrigerated trucks to the Federal Directorate of Immunisation (FDI), with the support of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance.\n\nThis initiative builds upon ongoing support that includes the delivery of 23 refrigerated vehicles in 2021 and seven pick-up trucks earlier this year. These investments are aimed at strengthening routine immunisation, improving outreach capacity, and bolstering the overall health system.\n\n“Every child has the right to be protected from preventable diseases. With the support of Gavi and in close coordination with the Government of Pakistan, these refrigerated trucks will help us ensure that every child has access to life-saving vaccines. By safeguarding vaccine potency through a strengthened cold chain, we are making strides toward a healthier Pakistan where every child is fully immunised,” said Abdullah Fadil, Unicef Representative in Pakistan.\n\nFederal Directorate of Immunisation Director General Dr Shabana Saleem said: “This support is instrumental in expanding our reach and building the capacity of our immunisation teams. We are grateful to our partners for standing with us in our shared goal of protecting every child through equitable and resilient health systems.”\n\nKamal concerned over polio refusals, advocates community engagement over punitive measures\n\nAccording to an official of the health ministry, Pakistan contributes 7 per cent to the support fund of Gavi and trucks were purchased from the same fund.\n\n“Unfortunately, Gavi and other donor agencies don’t trust officials sitting in the immunisation programme due to which they have been purchasing equipment. However, they also don’t share details of procurement due to which even we are not aware of the cost and other related details,” he claimed.\n\nHe also said that ordinary air conditioners were installed in trucks and suggested that purpose-built trucks (which have air conditioning on all walls) should have been purchased so that the quality of the vaccine would not be compromised.\n\nVaccine supply\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, Health Minister Mustafa Kamal said the truck would “significantly strengthen access to life-saving vaccines for children across Pakistan, including the remote regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and other hard-to-reach areas”.\n\nHe announced that five refrigerated trucks have been allocated to each province to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of vaccines nationwide.\n\n“The availability of these vehicles will guarantee the integrity of vaccine supply to all provinces and territories, helping us reach every child,” he added.\n\nDuring his address, the minister emphasised the need for primary healthcare, revealing that 70pc of patients visiting government hospitals could be treated at the basic health units (BHUs).\n\n“The day is near when doctors and medicines will reach people at their doorstep,” he claimed.\n\nMustafa Kamal also shed light on the ongoing national polio eradication campaign, which commenced on April 21. Over 450,000 frontline workers are participating in this crucial effort. For the first time, Pakistan and Afghanistan have launched synchronised polio campaigns, reflecting unprecedented cross-border collaboration.\n\nHowever, the minister expressed concern over growing refusals to administer polio drops. “Those who deny their children the polio vaccine are risking their lives,” he warned, while firmly opposing the use of force in such cases.\n\nHe stressed the need for community engagement over punitive measures, directing officials to counsel vaccine refusals instead of filing FIRs.\n\n“There is a cure for every disease — but not for polio,” Mr Kamal stated.\n\n“Polio eradication is a national cause. Every individual must contribute to protect our children from permanent disability.” He called for stronger support and cooperation with frontline workers.\n\nThe health minister also spoke about the responsibility of the health sector. “Our work is with God’s most beloved creation — human beings. We are doing everything we can to alleviate suffering, and I am committed to fulfilling my duties with sincerity and dedication,” he said.\n\n“This sector is perhaps the most demanding. Our positions are a test, and we are answerable. I aim to pass this test with the prayers and support of the people,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
