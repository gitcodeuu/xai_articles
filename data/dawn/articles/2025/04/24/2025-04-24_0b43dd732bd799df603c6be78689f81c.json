Citizens are being informed about the dangers of heat wave through the media.\n\n“The public is requested to take precautionary measures, and to especially take care of children, elderly and the sick, who are more vulnerable to the effects of a heatwave,” PDMA said.\n\nThe authority advised to avoid exertion and exercise outdoors.\n\nIt also recommended not to leave the house unnecessarily and wear light-colored cotton clothes.\n\nEarlier in the month, the PDMA had warned that South Punjab districts are at risk of a severe heatwave in the coming days, with temperatures rising by 4-7°C in the region.\n\nSchools across Punjab had also been advised to alter working hours or declare early summer holidays if excessive heat persisted.\n\nAn advisory by the PDMA recommended that schools should alter working hours or declare early summer holidays if excessive heat persists, all outdoor sports and activities should be suspended immediately.
