  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The sisters and spokesperson of ex-premier Imran Khan urged the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to proceed against the Adiala jail authorities for not implementing court’s order permitting meetings with the PTI founder in prison.\n\nWhile the PTI petitions seeking contempt proceeding ag­­a­inst the jail authorities were not schedule for hearing, PTI spokesman Niazullah Khan Niazi approached the rostrum where the division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Inaam Ameen Minhas was hearing other petitions.\n\nMr Niazi along with Ale­ema Khan, Noreen Khan, and prominent party lawyers met Maqsood Ahmed, the secretary to acting CJ.\n\nSoon afterwards, PTI representatives moved to the courtroom and requested the bench that the pending co­­ntempt pleas be scheduled. “We believe in the ru­­le of law,” he said. “Our pe­­titions are not being lis­ted despite repeated filings.” Justice Dogar respon­d­­ed that administrative mat­­te­­rs are addressed once the re­­­­levant files are presented.\n\nAs Aleema Khan stepped forward to address the bench, both the judges left the courtroom without hearing her remarks. A visibly disappointed Aleema later expressed her frustration with Mr Niazi for speaking first, saying, “I told you I had to speak. You spoke on your own.”\n\nSpeaking to the media outside the court, Aleema Khan criticised the handling of their petitions. “We are being deprived of justice,” she said. “If the judge’s orders are disrespected today, tomorrow every institution will face the same insult.”\n\nMr Niazi told reporters the jail authorities were openly violating court orders. “We informed the secretary earlier, and now we have raised the issue in court,” he said. “We have done our part to highlight that court orders are being ignored.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
