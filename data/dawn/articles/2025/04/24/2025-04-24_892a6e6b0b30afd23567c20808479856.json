Salute our astronauts!”\n\n“We wish you success!” the crowd shouted in unison as the crew members passed.\n\nLive images on state television then showed the three astronauts being transported by bus to the launch site, beyond which vast stretches of empty desert could be seen.\n\nThe crew will work on Tiangong for six months, carrying out experiments in physics and life sciences and installing protective equipment against space debris.\n\nFor the first time, they will also bring aboard planarians — aquatic flatworms known for their regenerative abilities.\n\nThe team will also conduct spacewalks, replenish supplies and carry out general maintenance on the space station.\n\nThree astronauts currently aboard Tiangong are scheduled to return to Earth on April 29 after completing handover procedures.\n\nBusloads of space enthusiasts waited by a barren highway several hours ahead of Thursday’s launch, braving the high desert sun to catch a glimpse of the rocket perched on the horizon.\n\nA kiosk by the entrance to the launch base did brisk trade in toy rockets and mission-themed memorabilia.\n\nDuring a government tour on Wednesday afternoon, AFP journalists saw the rocket ensconced in a sky-blue launch tower, surrounded by red flags as workers in blue jumpsuits made final checks before the launch.\n\nChina’s space programme is the third to put humans in orbit and has also landed robotic rovers on Mars and the Moon as it seeks parity with the world’s two most established celestial powers, the United States and Russia.\n\nCrewed by rotating teams of three astronauts every six months, Tiangong — whose name means “celestial palace” in Chinese — is the jewel in its crown.\n\nChina has been excluded from the International Space Station since 2011, when the United States banned NASA from collaborating with Beijing.\n\nIt has since sought to bring other countries into its space programme, and signed a deal with longtime ally Pakistan in February to bring the first foreign astronaut aboard Tiangong.\n\nAs part of this process, “two Pakistani astronauts will be selected to come to China for training”, the CMSA confirmed on Wednesday.",
