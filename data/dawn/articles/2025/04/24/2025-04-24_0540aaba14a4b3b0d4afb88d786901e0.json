Roads leading to Parachinar remained blocked for more than six months, resulting in shortage of medicines, edibles and other basic necessities in the area.\n\nEarlier towards the end of last month, both the sides of conflict in the district had signed an eight-month peace agreement while a fragile ceasefire was brokered in January this year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
