In Narowal, fires destroyed wheat on four acres in Class Goraiya, three acres in Quayampur, eight acres in Nowadey, nine acres in Dlhozey, 12 acres in Mank and four acres in Sagarpur.\n\nOfficials said that four fires were caused by short circuits and six due to carelessness involving smoking. Farmers Mohammad Afzal and Shahid Jatt said such incidents had occurred last year as well due to electric wires hanging over fields. Farmers demanded that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz compensate them for their losses.\n\nKASUR: A fire caused by sparks from high-tension 11kV electric wires gutted six acres of ripe wheat crop in village Badho Jevan in Chunian police jurisdiction.\n\nFarmer Muhammad Ishtiaq’s entire harvest was destroyed despite villagers’ efforts to douse the flames. Villagers accused Lesco of negligence, saying they had lodged repeated complaints about the hanging wires but no action was taken.\n\nThe affected farmer demanded compensation for the loss.\n\nGUJRANWALA: In Gujranwala’s suburban areas of Zafarabad and Garmola Warakan, wheat and fodder crops on around 23 acres were burnt. In Zafarabad, seven acres of Dost Muhammad, six acres of Shafqat Ali, seven acres of Ilyas Chadhar and 1.25 acres of Yousaf Tarkhan were destroyed.\n\nIn Garmola Warakan, two acres of wheat and six acres of fodder cultivated by Muhammad Nabeel were reduced to ashes.\n\nReports suggest that sparks from a chopper machine’s wiring started the fire. Authorities have urged farmers to ensure safety measures during harvesting and regularly maintain their equipment.\n\nThe agriculture department is assessing the losses and has indicated that compensation may be considered.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
