Why? Because India is a large country, and the West’s focus is fixated on containing China,” Gen Hayat said, adding that “these are the double standards, and they are dangerous for global peace and stability.”\n\nHe also criticised India’s official use of the name “Bharat” at international platforms, calling it a signal of a deeper ideological transition from a secular democracy to a “Hindu Rashtra”.\n\n“India is no longer ‘India.’ It is now ‘Bharat,’ and this is not just a name change — it is a signal,” he said.\n\nGen Hayat warned that India now possessed the world’s fastest-growing nuclear arsenal and had remained the largest arms importer for over a decade. He highlighted India’s expanding missile development programme, calling it a reflection of growing military ambitions.\n\nIndia’s strategic behaviour is unfolding across three dangerous dimensions: ideological extremism, technological militarisation, and political assertiveness, he said.\n\n“With the fastest-growing nuclear programme, long-range missile development, and a decade as the top arms importer, this trifecta is destabilising South Asia,” he added.\n\nGen Hayat also addressed the challenges posed by “multi-domain deterrence” — a strategic concept that integrates capabilities across land, sea, air, space, and cyberspace. Previously absent from traditional deterrence frameworks, multi-domain deterrence introduces a more complex and layered challenge to the global security architecture.\n\nThe two-day conference drew experts from Australia, Canada, China, Russia, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States to discuss the military implications of emerging technologies.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
