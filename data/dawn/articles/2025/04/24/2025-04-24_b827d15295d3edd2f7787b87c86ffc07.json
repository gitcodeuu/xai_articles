  "content": "KHUZDAR: Balochistan National Party (BNP) President Sardar Akhtar Mengal on Wednesday criticised the government’s treatment of Baloch women, highlighting that many are imprisoned simply for demanding their rights.\n\nSpeaking at a public meeting at Mir Ghous Bakhsh Bizenjo Stadium in Khuzdar, Mr Mengal said the rising political awareness among Baloch women is alarming the ruling elite. “Our women in Balochistan are now so aware that the rulers are losing their sleep over it. They fear the Baloch,” Mr Mengal said. “Our party resigned from the assemblies to advocate for Baloch rights. We have attempted to solve the issues of this region through political means, but things have only gotten worse.”\n\nHe said the Baloch people were no longer willing to trade their votes for unfulfilled promises. “Today’s rally in Khuzdar is different from the previous ones. The presence of thousands of people here proves that the people of Balochistan are alive,” he said.\n\nReferring to criticism against his resignation from the National Assembly, Mr Mengal said the move was made in consultation with people. “I was told that resigning from the assembly was wrong. But the decision belongs to my voters. I leave it to them to decide whether I made the right choice.” He later announced that the BNP would hold another rally in Quetta on May 2 for justice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2025",
