  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government has confirmed that the chairman and members of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) unilaterally increased their salaries early this year without the cabinet’s prior clearance.\n\nDespite earlier objections from the Cabinet Division, the government implicitly approved the salary increases, which had been deemed unauthorised and called for a written explanation.\n\nIn a written answer to the national assembly on a question from MNA Shagufta Jumani, Minister Incharge for Cabinet Division Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry on Monday confirmed that the gross salary of the Nepra chairman went beyond Rs3.247 million per month and those of members was more than Rs2.943m.\n\nEarlier, Cabinet Secretary Kamran Ali Afzal had told a Senate panel on February 18 that Nepra had been asked to provide reasons for the salary hike as the increase violated Section 8 of the Nepra Act, and the authority must submit a written explanation for its decision. Afzal further emphasised that all regulatory bodies fall under the jurisdiction of the prime minister or the federal cabinet.\n\nMs Jumani had sought details of the salaries along with fringe benefits and asked if the government had approved these increases.\n\nIn response, the cabinet minister said the chairman and members of the Nepra were also entitled to medical facilities, gratuity equal to one basic pay worth Rs772,780 for the chairman and Rs701,005 for members for each completed year of service.\n\nHe said the salary increases during the last five years (2020-21 to 2024-25) included the yearly Adhoc Relief Allowance announced by the government in the federal budget. He said that before the 2018 amendments to the Nepra Act, the emoluments of the chairman and members were determined by the federal government. However, after the 2018 amendments, Nepra was invested with the power of determining remuneration and allowances of the chairman and members with the approval of the federal government.\n\nHowever, even the federal government approval was subject to the principle and standards that the specialised nature of work to be performed by the Nepra, the need to ensure the financial self-sufficiency of the chairman and members and the salaries paid in the private sector to individuals with equivalent responsibilities, expertise and skills.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
