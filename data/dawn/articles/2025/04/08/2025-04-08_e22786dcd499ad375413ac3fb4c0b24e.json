The regularisation of restaurants under the broad category of “recreational use” was also called into question, with the PTI leader arguing that this would erode the sanctity of residential neighbourhoods and invite further violations.\n\nMr Sheikh pointed out that under the new amendments, educational institutions could be set up without feasibility assessments or planning considerations, potentially burdening local infrastructure and disrupting residential life.\n\nHe alleged that the changes had been enacted to benefit certain influential groups and had resulted in the overnight regularisation of thousands of previously unauthorised or illegal constructions. The decision, he said, had been taken unilaterally without consulting key urban planning and land-owning agencies.\n\nCalling on the chief secretary to intervene, the PTI leader demanded the immediate withdrawal of the amendments and recommended that the government initiate a comprehensive consultation process with all relevant stakeholders.\n\n‘Conspiracy to destroy urban life’\n\nThe Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) took the parliamentary route to resist the amendments.\n\nLeader of the Opposition in the Sindh Assembly Ali Khurshidi submitted a resolution with the assembly secretariat against the SBCA’s decision, calling it a part of the “builder mafia’s agenda.”\n\n“We believe that the plan to convert residential areas into commercial zones is a conspiracy to destroy urban life,” said Mr Khurshidi. “The PPP government has sacrificed Karachi’s master plan to benefit influential individuals. The amendments to the Karachi Town Planning and Building Regulations serve the interests of the builder mafia, not the public.”\n\nHe said: “We won’t let this happen and would foil the conspiracy to turn Karachi into a commercial waste dump.”\n\nA couple of days ago, senior MQM-P leader and Federal Health Minister Syed Mustafa Kamal had said that his party rejected the amendments. He also demanded that the PPP withdraw the controversial changes.\n\nJI wants SBCA chief removed\n\nLeader of the opposition in the City Council, Advocate Saifuddin raised almost the same concerns and sought debate on the subject in the council. He demanded the SBCA’s control under the city administration.\n\n“The PPP government aims at destroying the already shaken Karachi through amendments to Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe City Council opposition leader, who belongs to the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), said the amendments by the Sindh government were aimed at benefiting the influential elite and sheltering illegitimate constructions.\n\nDemanding removal of the SBCA DG, Mr Saifuddin said the DG had approved several amendments to the building regulations while totally ignoring the elected local government.\n\nHe added that amendments in the Rule 27 had kicked out the land used for educational, health and welfare activities from the amenity list. The amendment in Regulation 232 introduced another category of residential-cum-commercial under which the residential land could be used for business purposes, the JI leader said.\n\nAlso on Monday, JI-Karachi chief Monem Zafar told a press conference that his party would move the high court against the amendments.\n\nHe said that the JI was deliberating with lawyers on the matter.\n\n“The PPP has turned Karachi into ruins. To pinch salt to the wounds, the PPP government has amended the building bylaws,” he said. “These amendments in fact provide legal cover to the commercial usage of residential properties. The amendments have been made to facilitate a very few influential capitalists.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
