  "content": "SAHIWAL: A couple and their young son died, while their three other children were hospitalised at Arifwala, Pakpattan district, in a critical condition, allegedly after consuming a home-cooked dish of chicken claws that turned out to be poisonous.\n\nAs per police and local sources, Muhammad Ramzan, a resident of 27/EB village, Pakka Hata, had purchased chicken claws to prepare a meal for his family comprising his wife Sakina Bibi and four children — three sons and a minor daughter.\n\nAs soon as the family members took the meal, they started complaining of acute stomach pain and nausea.\n\nWitnesses say that Ramzan and his son, Ali Usman (16), died on the spot, while locals shifted Sakina and her three children to Arifwala THQ Hospital in private vehicles.\n\nLater, Sakina Bibi also died at the hospital’s emergency ward.\n\nDoctors are currently treating the remaining children — Ali Imran (18), Ali Irfan (15), and Maham (8).\n\nDr Usman, Deputy District Health Officer (DDHO), Arifwala THQ Hospital, stated that the condition of the surviving children of the deceased couple is not stable so far despite washing of their stomachs. Blood samples of the victims have been collected to determine the cause of death, and an autopsy is planned, he added. Arifwala Saddar police are trying to trace the person who sold chicken claws to the affected family.\n\nA chicken seller in Farid Town, Sahiwal, told Dawn that many low-income families cook chicken claws, after washing and boiling them and removing the outer skin, as they cost just around Rs150 per kilogram, whereas the chicken meat price has spiraled up to Rs750 per kg.\n\nHowever, it is yet to be known how the meal consumed by Ramzan and his family turned poisonous. Meanwhile, Arifwala Rescue 1122 officials claimed that they received no emergency calls about the food poisoning incident.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
