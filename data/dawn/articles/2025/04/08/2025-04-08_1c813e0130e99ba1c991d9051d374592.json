Pakistan is among the largest troop contributors to the peacekeeping missions deployed in hotspots around the world.\n\nNext week, Pakistan will host Peacekeeping Ministerial preparatory meeting, in partnership with South Korea, in Islamabad.\n\n“We are also proud to join hands with Denmark and the Republic of Korea, in a trio to keep this vital agenda front and center during our current tenure on the Council.”\n\nAmbassador Asim also stressed the need for timely, credible information and prompt reporting of violations for effective ceasefire monitoring and regular reporting to the Security Council by the six missions currently tasked with this role.\n\nHe paid tributes to the 4,423 peacekeepers, who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty, including 181 Pakistani peacekeepers. We honour their memory, bravery and service.\n\nThe Pakistani envoy described the military component as the backbone of UN peacekeeping, saying that the ’blue helmets’ are not just the face of UN peacekeeping they are its pride.\n\nIn this regard, he called for collaboration with regional and sub-regional organisations to boost peacekeeping impact; mitigating threats from landmines and iImprovised explosive devices through specialised training, and improving peacekeeper mobility with helicopters and all-terrain vehicles.\n\nThe ambassador also proposed equipping peacekeepers with training on ceasefire agreements, and to hold perpetrators accountable for attacks on peacekeeper — recent incidents across multiple missions highlight the urgency of this issue.\n\nEarlier, briefing the Security Council, Jean-Pierre Lacroix, head of UN peace operations, said, “Ceasefire monitoring can no longer be just about being present, it is about rapidly understanding and acting on what is happening on the ground.”\n\nAdvances in technology, he explained, are helping blue helmets increase their impact by allowing them to monitor vast and complex landscapes in near-real time overcoming the need to be physically on the ground.\n\nAt the same time, a political process backed by the unified support of member states, particularly the Security Council, remains vital to secure and sustain peace.\n\n“While peacekeeping can be an integral part of a ceasefire monitoring regime, the success of any ceasefire remains the sole responsibility of the parties [to the agreement],” he said.\n\nSince this cessation of hostilities and in the absence of a permanent ceasefire, one of the main obstacles has always been that the parties interpret differently their obligations under resolution 1701 and now with respect to the cessation of hostilities understanding, Lt. Gen. Lzaro said.\n\nAnother challenge is the rise of misinformation and disinformation, which undermines the credibility of UN peacekeepers and fuels local distrust. It compelled UNIFIL to adapt its approach to safeguard credibility, project impartiality and strengthen trust.\n\n“Effective outreach, fact-checking and timely responses are critical to safeguarding the missions impartiality,” Lt. Gen. Lzaro said, noting that UNIFIL has implemented a structured communication strategy to counter misinformation, ensuring that messages are fact-based, clear and consistent across all peacekeeping units.",
