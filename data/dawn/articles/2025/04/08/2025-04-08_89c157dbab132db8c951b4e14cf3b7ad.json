They were shifted to King Abdullah Teaching Hospital for emergency care.\n\nThe ambassador’s vehicle was damaged but all those riding in it, including him, remained unharmed.\n\nHe, along with his embassy’s staff members, was returning to Islamabad after inaugurating a newly-carpeted link road in the Jandwal area of Shinkiari.\n\nDistrict police officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur confirmed brake failure and the injury of 10 police personnel in the accident, and said that the injured were shifted to a local health centre.\n\n“All injured were provided emergency care at the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital. Their condition is now stable,” he said.\n\nThe DPO said that the police had made foolproof security arrangements for the ambassador’s visit, while patrol and escort vehicles were also provided.\n\nHe said that he had submitted a detailed report about the accident to the provincial police chief.\n\nMr Gandapur later visited the hospital to inquire after the injured.\n\nAccording to a list issued by the police department, the injured included SHO of the Shinkiari police station Saqib Khan, assistant sub-inspector Hamza Khan, constables Mohammad Shehbaz, Mohammad Jawad, Mohammad Yunus, Abdul Wajid, Farman Shah and Mohammad Javed and women constables Sana Bibi and Zainab Bibi.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
