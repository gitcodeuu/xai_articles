Therefore, the notification should also be set aside.\n\nNew list\n\nThe petition also sought a direction that the Registrar IHC should issue a revised seniority list in accordance with the declarations made by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe petition argued that the transfer notification, seniority list and the decision on representation have been issued in violation of Article 200(1) of the Constitution since the provision only provides for a temporary transfer, for a limited time period, without affecting the inter-se seniority at the high court to which the judges were transferred.\n\nKBA plea\n\nThe KBA in its petition, filed through senior counsel Faisal Siddiqi, regretted that the transferred judges were immediately given prominent positions, with Justice Dogar being elevated to the position of senior puisne judge, despite being 15th in seniority at the Lahore High Court.\n\nThe sudden change in seniority relegated the existing judges of the IHC, who had served for years, to lower positions.\n\nChallenging the move, the petition argued that the transfers were not made in the public interest but were instead motivated by extraneous reasons, aimed at punishing certain judges and disrupting the functioning of the IHC.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
