It is also expected to curb the growing trend of undocumented cotton trade in the local market, helping to enhance government revenue.\n\nFinal approval from PM expected in a couple of days; move subject to IMF permission\n\nUnder the Export Facilitation Scheme, sales tax exemptions had been granted to imported cotton, yarn, and grey cloth, while an 18pc sales tax was levied on their domestic sale. This disparity led to an economic crisis, with cotton imports reaching record highs while the local market struggled. There were also concerns about a sharp decline in cotton cultivation this year.\n\nIn response, stakeholders demanded that the federal government abolish the sales tax on local cotton and its products to boost the economy. Following these persistent demands, PM Shehbaz formed a committee consisting of three federal ministers — Finance Minister Aurangzeb, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Ahmed — along with relevant federal secretaries.\n\nThe committee held extensive discussions with representatives of the PCGA, Aptma and PRGMEA over several days. After understanding their positions in detail, it was decided to hold another meeting to resolve the issue.\n\nAhsan Iqbal, Jam Kamal Ahmed, and relevant federal secretaries met again on Monday in Islamabad, where all stakeholders unanimously agreed to abolish the 18pc sales tax on the domestic sale of cotton, yarn, and grey cloth.\n\nPCGA Chairman Dr Jasoo Mal and former chairman Sohail Mahmood Haral informed the federal ministers that this decision would fully revitalise the cotton industry, reducing imports, improving the country’s foreign exchange reserves, and raising cotton prices, benefiting growers this year.\n\nCotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq argued that if the government cannot exempt the local cotton sector from the tax due to IMF pressure, it should at least impose a similar tax on imported cotton and its products to provide a level-playing field for the local industry and growers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
