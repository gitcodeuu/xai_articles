Only committees are being formed and delaying tactics are being used.”\n\nProtesters continued their sit-in at Chilas despite harsh weather, Ramazan and Eid for 51 consecutive day, he said. “Now the protesters are fast losing patience noticing that federal government, GB government and Wapda officials are not serious to settle the issue,” said Hazratullah, who was accompanied by Umar Yar, Najeeb, Usman, Shahid, Aftab and others.\n\nHe made it clear that the protesters were committed to calling off the protest only after the fulfilment of their demands.\n\nAfter negotiations with the district administration, the protesters reopened the KKH only till Tuesday, while Maulana Hazratullah announced their plan to close the KKH for an indefinite period.\n\nHe also said the protesters would begin a long march towards the dam site and asked people to prepare accordingly. He advised all passengers going from Gilgit-Baltistan to Rawalpindi and from Rawalpindi to Gilgit should avoid travel, claiming that the highway could be blocked at any time. He also claimed that the offices of Wapda and other companies in Chilas and other places would not be allowed to resume work.\n\nHazratullah also asked oil tanker operators and owners of oil supply companies to stop the supply to Wapda and other dam construction companies.\n\nSources said GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has contacted the Prime Minister Secretariat to arrange PM’s meeting with protesters representatives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
