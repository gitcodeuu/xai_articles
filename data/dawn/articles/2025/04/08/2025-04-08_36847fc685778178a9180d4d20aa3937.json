  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Only a provisional licence has been granted to Starlink to provide satellite-based internet services in the country and the final regulatory approval was still awaited, Federal IT Minister Shaza Fatima said on Monday.\n\nThe statement came during a meeting of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on IT & Telecom, chaired by Syed Aminul Haque.\n\nThe minister said Starlink services were expected to be available in the country by the end of this year.\n\nStarlink, the satellite internet service run by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, has recently been granted a provisional licence by the Pakistan Space Activities Regulatory Board (PSARB).\n\nThe federal minister said there were no complications in the licensing process, emphasising that satellite internet was a new technology and required careful consideration.\n\nA Chinese firm — Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology — has also applied for a satellite-based internet licence, she added. “The government is encouraging competition in the sector.”\n\nRetired Major General Hafeezur Rehman, the Chairman of Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), informed the committee that a permanent licence would be issued once regulatory processes were finalised and a consultant hired to finalise regulations for satellite-based internet services.\n\nThe PTA chief revealed that multiple spectrum cases were pending in courts and that if these cases remain unresolved, the 5G auction process could face hurdles.\n\n“The country is currently utilising 274 MHz of the spectrum, which is insufficient.\n\n“Approximately 860 MHz is required for smooth connectivity,” the PTA chairman said.\n\nThe NA Committee appointed a sub-committee to analyse the pending litigation around spectrum issues, especially those that may potentially impact 5G auction, and analyse cases where litigants have obtained stay orders.\n\nCommunication app\n\nThe committee discussed the status of BEEP, an internet-based communication app for government officials. It was informed by Babar Majid Bhatti, the CEO of National Information Technology Board (NITB), that the app was ready for launch.\n\n“The BEEP App has been developed for secure communication between government officials. It resembles WhatsApp in interface, but has enhanced security features, supports audio and video calls, sharing of documents, and enables Zoom-style video conferencing,” Mr Bhatti added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
