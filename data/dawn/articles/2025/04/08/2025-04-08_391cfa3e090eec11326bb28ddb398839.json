In December 2023, the Asian Development Bank reported in a study that domestic violence was emerging as a silent pandemic in Pakistan, posing a serious challenge to society and the state.\n\nA pregnant woman was killed by her husband last week over a domestic dispute, police said on Sunday.\n\nIn March, a woman seeking khula was allegedly killed by her husband outside the Malir court premises. In a separate incident, a woman was stabbed and killed, allegedly by her former husband, inside a local hotel in the Nursery area.\n\nAccording to a ‘Mapping Gender-Based Violence (GBV) 2024’ report released by the Sustainable Social Development Organisation, conviction rates for gender-based violence in Pakistan were extremely low.\n\nIn Punjab, domestic violence cases stood at 1,167, with just three convictions, whereas KP totalled 446 cases of domestic violence, but no convictions were recorded.\n\nSindh registered 375 cases for domestic violence, but no justice was served in terms of convictions.\n\nBalochistan had the highest conviction count among all provinces for the category, with 25 convictions out of 160 cases.",
