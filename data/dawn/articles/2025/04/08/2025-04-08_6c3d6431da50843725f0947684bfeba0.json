A female customs official was seen grabbing one of the passengers by her hair and dragging her away. In another video, one of the women passengers was seen picking up confiscated stuff and warning the officials.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson for the customs, three women arrived at the airport from the UAE. “The women who brought bridal dresses weighing 40kg and 24 security cameras wanted their luggage clearance without fulfilling legal requirements,” he said and added when the customs refused to clear their luggage, they created a scene at the airport and indulged in a brawl. The women; however, succeeded in handing over their luggage without clearance to their accomplices who had come to receive them at the airport.\n\nThe women were later identified as Noor Fatima, Saman Khalid and Alisha Malik of Hafizabad.\n\nA case has been registered against the three women under sections 353, 186 and 427 of the PPC after the customs officials handed them over to the police. Late night media reports suggested the women were acquitted by a local court.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
