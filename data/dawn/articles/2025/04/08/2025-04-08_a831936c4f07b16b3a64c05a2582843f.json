  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The persistent underperformance of the Pakistan cricket team over the past two years came under scrutiny in the National Assembly on Monday. Despite the country’s cricket board submitting a list of factors contributing to the team’s decline, the explanations fell short of providing any substantial analysis or practical solutions.\n\nIn a written submission, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) cited general reasons such as injuries and varying playing conditions but failed to offer a deep-dive into the root causes or any meaningful measures to rectify the situation. The response lacked specific details, drawing criticism for being overly vague.\n\nThe PCB acknowledged the challenges faced by the national team in recent international tournaments, but its justification remained unconvincing.\n\n“The PCB recognises the challenges faced by the national team in recent international tournaments and bilateral series,” the board stated, offering no clear strategy for improvement. The national team, once a formidable force in world cricket, has seen its performance take a nosedive in recent years.\n\nAfter a disappointing early exit from the ICC World Cup in India in 2023, the team suffered another blow when it failed to make the semi-finals of the 2024 T20 World Cup in the USA and the West Indies later that year. To add to the embarrassment, Pakistan, despite hosting the ICC Champions Trophy earlier this year, suffered humiliating defeats before series losses to New Zealand in both T20Is and ODIs.\n\nDuring the question-answer session in the National Assembly, MNA Shazia Marri asked the PCB to explain the reasons behind the team’s consistent underperformance in both bilateral series and international tournaments over the last two years.\n\nShe also inquired about the review system in place for evaluating the selection process, coaching staff, and player fitness, and the steps being taken to develop grassroots cricket.\n\nAlthough the issue was part of the Question Hour agenda, the National Assembly did not engage in a full debate on the matter. However, in its written response, the PCB outlined several factors it believes have contributed to the team’s inconsistent performances.\n\n“Key players have suffered injuries at crucial moments, impacting team balance and strategy,” the reply read. “The PCB is actively working on strengthening injury prevention and rehabilitation programs.”\n\nIt also highlighted how varying playing conditions across different venues have sometimes hindered the team’s adaptability.\n\nTo address these issues, the PCB noted that it is focusing on improving preparation and analytical strategies for diverse playing environments.\n\nFurthermore, the board emphasised its commitment to identifying performance gaps and implementing strategies to improve coaching methodologies and player development programs.\n\nThe PCB also assured that a robust evaluation system is in place to ensure continuous accountability and improvement in selection, coaching, and fitness.\n\n“The selection committee follows a merit-based approach, evaluating domestic performances, fitness levels, and international exposure. Post-series reviews are conducted to reassess strategies and make necessary adjustments,” the board stated.\n\nThe board further clarified that transparent selection decisions, effective coaching, and maintaining high fitness standards for players are integral components of their long-term strategy.\n\nIn terms of grassroots development, the PCB mentioned several initiatives aimed at nurturing future talent.\n\n“More regional tournaments have been introduced alongside ongoing domestic red and white-ball events. High-performance centers have been set up in multiple cities to provide young cricketers with professional training. Nationwide talent-hunt programs targeting schools and colleges are also underway to scout and develop emerging players,” the PCB added.\n\nThese efforts are designed to establish a sustainable cricket structure that will benefit Pakistan’s international performance in the years to come.\n\nMeanwhile, in response to a question by MNA Sharmila Faruqui, the PCB confirmed that it is upgrading its stadiums to meet international standards.\n\nThe process, which will span several years, is expected to be completed in phases by the end of 2026. The first phase of upgrades, approved by the PCB’s Board of Governors, has an initial budget of Rs11.8 billion, with the second phase costing an additional Rs6.2 billion. The second phase will commence after the completion of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in April 2025.\n\nThe PCB also assured that there have been no budget overruns so far. “The PCB undergoes two audits annually, at the end of its fiscal year. The audits for the current fiscal year will take place after June 30, 2025,” the board confirmed.\n\nRegarding the financial aspects of hosting the ICC Champions Trophy, the PCB clarified that the event is owned and managed by the International Cricket Council (ICC), with all related income and expenses falling under ICC’s purview.\n\nThe feasibility study was conducted as part of the event’s overall planning, and the PCB earned approximately Rs3 billion, surpassing its initial target of Rs2 billion.\n\nHowever, the final profit figure will be determined once the ICC completes its financial audit. The PCB insisted that there had been no overspending or mismanagement, as the Champions Trophy was entirely managed by the ICC.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 8th, 2025",
