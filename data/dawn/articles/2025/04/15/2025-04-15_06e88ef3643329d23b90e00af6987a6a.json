She obliterated New Zealand’s Meriam Ibrahim 11-1, 11-0, 11-3, and will face Elizabeth Wang in the semis.\n\nThe 12-year-old is currently the No. 1 ranked women’s squash player in Pakistan as of March, with Mehwish at No.5 and Sehrish at No. 14.\n\nMeanwhile, Nouman Khan lost to Elijah Rolls in Monday’s Round of 16 after failing to score a single point.",
