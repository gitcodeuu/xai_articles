  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti has said Pink Scooty Programme is not just a government initiative, but a beacon of hope for every daughter who wants to move forward, make her own decisions and determine her own path in life.\n\nIn a statement shared on social media, CM Bugti said, “A few months ago, the dream we envisioned — of our daughters being independent and standing on their own feet — is now becoming a reality”.\n\nHe said seeing a sister and daughter confidently riding a scooty on the streets of Quetta filled his heart with joy.\n\n“We are wholeheartedly extending this mission across Balochistan so that daughters in every city, town, and village of the province can enjoy the same facilities, confidence, and freedom that daughters in Quetta are now experiencing.”\n\nThe Balochistan government firmly believed that a society could not progress without empowering women, and the Pink Scooty initiative was a practical reflection of this belief., he said, adding that the programme would be expanded further in the future.\n\nThe chief minister appealed to parents, teachers, and all sectors of society to encourage their daughters in turning their dreams into reality.\n\nHe urged them to provide girls with complete freedom in education, employment, and mobility so they can play a meaningful role in the development of society.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 15th, 2025",
