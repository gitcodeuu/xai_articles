This project would help expand the ship-breaking industry and provide facilities to investors, he added.\n\nThe minister added that under the Hong Kong Convention roadmap, the government is implementing a plan for environmentally safe recycling of end-of-life ships.\n\nApart from generating tax revenue, the Gadani ship-breaking recycling industry is playing a role model’s part in national economic development.\n\nEarlier, the BDA chairman briefed the minister about the approved project that included the development of road infrastructure, a 30-bed hospital, a state-of-the-art rescue centre, a fire brigade station, a one-window facilitation centre, and a water supply project.\n\nIn the briefing, it was also mentioned that work is underway on a project to establish treatment and storage facilities for hazardous waste generated from ship recycling operations at Gadani.\n\nThe ship-breaking industry provides raw material to steel sector re-rolling mills and allied industries in Pakistan, which are a source of livelihood for a number of people.\n\nA delegation of the ship-breakers association pointed out that the industry had been affected in recent years by smuggled, non-custom-paid scrap from Iran. They urged the government to take steps to stop the influx of scrap that would ultimately result in increase in tax revenue.\n\nThe minister appreciated the association’s role and suggestions for the industry’s development and assured them that he would take up the matter with the federal government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 15th, 2025",
