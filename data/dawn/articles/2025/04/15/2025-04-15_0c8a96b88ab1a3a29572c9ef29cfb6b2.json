Quoting experts, he said if hydrogen sulfide is increased to a certain level, it may become fatal to human life.\n\nRescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Khan also told Dawn the experts have reignited the fire as part of safety measures.\n\nEarlier in the day, the residents of the area took a sigh of relief when the fire completely extinguished on its own.\n\nKhan had said that the intensity of the flames started receding on late Monday night, and the fire disappeared at around 4am.\n\nThe huge flames erupted during the drilling of a housing project late last month and continued to rage for 18 days.\n\nA day earlier, the Sindh chief secretary’s spokesperson said that the government would consult American experts to help extinguish the fire after an inspection of the site revealed that its intensity had not decreased.\n\nHe said that during inspection, it was observed that the borehole had further expanded due to the volume of gas, and hot water continued to leak.\n\nLast week, the federal government also constituted a committee of experts to conduct a detailed technical investigation to assess the cause and extent of the blaze.\n\nFire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.\n\nOn Thursday, a huge fire broke out in a factory inside the Export Processing Zone located in Landhi Industrial Area Extension.\n\nLast year, the KMC informed the Sindh High Court that it had conducted a fire safety audit of over 265 commercial buildings, and not a single one was found to have a fire safety certificate or a no-objection certificate (NOC) issued by the fire brigade department.\n\nOut of 265 buildings, around 155 did not have fire alarms and smoke detectors installed, while the status of nine such buildings was not available in this respect, the KMC report added. Similarly, the condition of the wiring and electric system of over 155 buildings was termed unsatisfactory. Regarding access to firefighting equipment, the report said that around 200 buildings had no or unsatisfactory firefighting equipment.\n\nThe SHC had directed provincial authorities to ensure that relevant teams inspect all shopping malls in the city to ascertain safety standards in place.",
