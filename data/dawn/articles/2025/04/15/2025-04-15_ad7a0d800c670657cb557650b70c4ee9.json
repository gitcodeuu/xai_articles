These counters provided immediate support and guidance to overseas attendees.\n\nSpeaking at the occasion, National Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq assured overseas Pakistanis that legislation would be introduced to protect their land and property rights.\n\nHighlighting the challenges faced by overseas Pakistanis, Mr Sadiq said that legislating for the protection of their properties, and providing them with facilities should be among the government’s top priorities.\n\nHe also shed light on the disadvantages of sending money through illegal channels — such as hawala/hundi — noting that such methods not only harm the national economy, but also lead to legal and financial difficulties for overseas Pakistanis.\n\nThe NA speaker also stressed the importance of including overseas Pakistanis in the electoral process and called for the serious consideration of proposals in this regard.\n\nFederal Minister for Overseas Pak­istanis and Human Resource Deve­lopment Chaudhry Salik Hussain also lauded the Pakistani diaspora for the record remittances they had sent in.\n\nThe minister said that the aim of the event was to listen to the problems of overseas Pakistanis and find solutions.\n\nMr Salik said the government had passed a special bill for overseas Pakistanis, which had also become law in Punjab as well.\n\nSpecial courts will be formed for overseas Pakistanis, which will give a decision within 90 days, and they will not have to come to Pakistan for every appearance, the minister said. He said PM Shehbaz Sharif and Army Chief Gen Asim Munir are expec­ted to address the convention tomorrow.\n\nWith input from APP and Bakhtawar Mian in Islamabad\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 15th, 2025",
