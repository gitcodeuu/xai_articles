Such formal recognition by Paris would mark a major policy switch and risk antagonising Israel, which insists such moves by foreign states are premature.\n\n“President Macron is gravely mistaken in continuing to promote the idea of a Palestinian state in the heart of our land — a state whose sole aspiration is the destruction of Israel,” Israel’s Prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement.\n\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry condemned the Israeli prime minister’s criticism of Macron for announcing that Paris intended to recognise a Palestinian state within months.\n\n“The ministry strongly condemns the unjustified attack and offensive rem­arks made by Prime Minister Benjamin Netan­yahu and his son against President Emmanuel Macron,” the Ramallah-based ministry said in a statement.\n\nNew EU aid\n\nThe European Union on Monday announced a new three-year financial support package for the Palestinians worth up to 1.6 billion euros ($1.8bn).\n\nThe fresh aid pledge came just ahead of a meeting between Palestinian prime minister Mohammed Mustafa and EU foreign ministers in Luxembourg.\n\n“We are stepping up our support to the Palestinian people. EUR1.6 billion until 2027 will help stabilise the West Bank and Gaza,” EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas wrote on X.\n\n“This will reinforce the PA’s ability to meet the needs of the Palestinian people in the West Bank and prepare it to return to govern Gaza once conditions allow,” Kallas said.\n\nNo breakthrough\n\nThe latest round of talks in Cairo to restore the defunct Gaza ceasefire and free Israeli prisoners ended with no apparent breakthrough, Palestinian and Egyptian sources said on Monday.\n\nThe sources said Hamas had stuck to its position that any agreement must lead to an end to the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael, which restarted its military campaign in Gaza last month after a ceasefire agreed in January unravelled, has said it will not end the war until Hamas is stamped out. The Palestinian group has ruled out any proposal that calls for it to lay down arms.\n\nBut despite that fundamental disagreement, the sources said a Hamas delegation led by the group’s Gaza Chief Khalil Al-Hayya had shown some flexibility over how many prisoners it could free in return for Palestinians held by Israel should a truce be extended.\n\nAn Egyptian source told Reuters the latest proposal to extend the truce would see Hamas free an increased number of prisoners.\n\nHamas has asked for more time to respond to the latest proposal, the Egyptian source said. “Hamas has no problem, but it wants guarantees Israel agrees to begin the talks on the second phase of the ceasefire agreement”, the Egyptian source said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 15th, 2025",
