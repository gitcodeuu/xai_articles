  "content": "The Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Tuesday disposed of a petition seeking the release of Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) chief organiser Dr Mahrang Baloch, asking the petitioner to approach the home department for her release.\n\nOn Thursday, the BHC reserved its verdict on the petition filed by Nadia Baloch, Mahrang’s sister, challenging the detention of the BYC leader and other activists who had been sent to jail under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Ordinance.\n\nToday’s petition was heard by a division bench comprising Acting Chief Justice Ejaz Ahmed Swati and Justice Muhammad Aamir Rana.\n\nThe court converted the constitutional petition into a representation and sent it to the Balochistan home secretary for processing.\n\nIt suggested that the petitioner first present their complaints before the home department to ascertain whether the MPO was legal or not.\n\nWhile speaking to Dawn.com, Advocate Imran Baloch who represents the petitioner, reiterated that the plea was seeking the release of Mahrang and for the MPO to be declared illegal.\n\n“We had told the court to apprise us on details of Mahrang’s case [and that] is our legal right,” Baloch told Dawn.com.\n\n“However, instead of getting details from the government, the court directed us to approach the home department.”\n\nOn March 21, police used tear gas and water cannons and fired blank shots to disperse BYC protesters, who had staged a sit-in on the Sariab Road near the University of Balochistan against alleged enforced disappearances, including of its leader Bebarg Baloch.\n\nThe provincial government and the BYC had reported casualties on their sides as a result of each other’s actions, with the activist group claiming three dead and 13 others suffering injuries and the police saying around 10 of their personnel were hurt.\n\nThe situation further escalated when BYC chief organiser Mahrang was arrested in the early hours the next day and was booked under terror charges along with 150 others.\n\nResponding to BYC’s call, shutter-down strikes were staged over the weekend in various cities of Balochistan — including Quetta, Panjgur, Kalat, Turbat, Mastung, Kharan, Chaghi, Dalbandin and Dhadar.\n\nProtest rallies were held by BYC workers and supporters in different areas of Balochistan against the arrest of Mahrang, Beebow Baloch and other leaders on Sunday.\n\nThe call for demonstrations and rallies in 20 towns and cities including Quetta was given by BYC leadership. However, a rally could not be held in Quetta where the local administration had deployed a heavy contingent of police which did not allow the BYC workers to come on the road.\n\nRallies were held in Pansi, Turbat, Gwadar, Noshki, Kalat, Mastung, Khuzdar, Hub, Bela, Dalbandin, Sibi, Kharan, Jiwani and other areas.\n\nThe participants marched in various streets carrying placards and banners inscribed with their demands. They chanted slogans against the government and demanded the release of Mahrang and other arrested workers and leaders of the BYC.",
