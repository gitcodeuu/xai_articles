  "content": "LAHORE: In an unusual scene, both the government and the opposition voiced their concerns regarding the province’s wheat policy in the Punjab Assembly on Thursday.\n\nHowever, the session was also marked by opposition protests and a lack of government representation during a crucial debate.\n\nDuring the general discussion on wheat, the absence of any provincial minister to address the assembly drew criticism from both sides of the aisle. This lack of ministerial presence led to a unified stance against the government’s apparent disinterest in the critical issue affecting the agricultural sector.\n\nAdding to the turmoil, the opposition initiated a protest following the arrest of Opposition Leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar outside Adiala Jail. Opposition members chanted slogans and staged a walkout from the assembly in protest against the arrest of their leader and other members.\n\nChief Whip of the Opposition, Rana Shahbaz, while speaking on the wheat procurement issue, used a local idiom stating, “It’s like playing a flute in front of a buffalo (cast pearls before a swine); we know it’s futile, but at least bring the buffalo!”\n\nFormer speaker Rana Iqbal, however, objected to the use of the word “buffalo,” deeming it unparliamentary and demanding expunging it from the record.\n\nAmidst the opposition protest, verbal exchanges were reported between treasury member Azma Kardar and opposition members. Following the walkout, opposition MPA Sheikh Imtiaz pointed out the lack of quorum.\n\nPanel of Chairperson Agha Ali Haider regretted that the opposition was trying to adjourned proceedings of the session convened on its requisition.\n\nHowever, he ordered the bells to be rung for five minutes, but with the quorum not being met, the session was adjourned until Friday (today), at 2pm.\n\nEarlier in the session, Panel of Chairpersons Samiullah Khan expressed his displeasure over the unsatisfactory responses provided by Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Usama Leghari, during the Question Hour.\n\nHe regretted that matters were being referred to committees instead of answers being provided in the House.\n\nFurthermore, Samiullah Khan referred the matter of Junid Afzal Sahi’s questions regarding the land area of the Ayub Research Centre in Faisalabad and the agricultural university in Faisalabad to the relevant committee, demanding a report within two months.\n\nThe united front of the government and opposition against the government’s wheat policy became evident when the discussion on wheat procurement was to be advanced, but only the parliamentary secretary was present in the House. This lack of interest from the government drew sharp criticism from both treasury and opposition benches.\n\nFormer Minister of Minerals and PML-N leader, Sher Ali Khan, stated that the presence of a parliamentary secretary instead of a minister reflected the government’s lack of interest. He accused the government of encouraging farmers to cultivate wheat and then failing to procure it. He demanded that the government clearly state its intentions regarding wheat procurement.\n\nGovernment ally Ali Haider Gilani questioned the fate of the wheat crop cultivated over 15 million acres if the support price was not announced, urging the government to outline its future strategy. He also highlighted the adverse impact of the government’s stance on wheat on other crops.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 18th, 2025",
