  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Justice Raja Inaam Amin Minhas of the Islamabad High Court on Thursday directed the federal government to submit its response to petitions challenging the controversial amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) in two weeks.\n\nThe consolidated hearing brought together petitions filed by a faction of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ), senior journalist Hamid Mir and the Islamabad High Court Journalists’ Association.\n\nRepresenting the petitioners, lawyers Riasat Ali Azad, Imran Shafiq and others appeared before the court, arguing that the government’s delay in filing a response reflects a lack of seriousness.\n\nDuring the hearing, Advocate Azad urged the court to issue a stay on the implementation of the amended Peca provisions, citing increasing misuse of the law against journalists. Two months have passed, and no reply has been filed. Meanwhile, FIRs are being registered to suppress press freedom, Mr Azad said, presenting cases filed under the amended law.\n\nAdvocate Imran Shafiq highlighted the chilling effect the law has had on journalists.\n\nJustice Minhas said the court will not issue interim relief until both parties have been heard. “This law has been passed by parliament. Whether it is right or wrong will be decided through judicial review,” the judge said.\n\nThe Deputy Attorney General assured the court that the government would file its response soon. In the meantime, the court urged the government to recognise the urgency of the matter, especially in the light of the alleged misuse of the amended Peca provisions.\n\nBefore concluding the session, the court granted a 15-day extension for the submission of comments and indicated the case would be scheduled for hearing immediately after responses are filed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 18th, 2025",
