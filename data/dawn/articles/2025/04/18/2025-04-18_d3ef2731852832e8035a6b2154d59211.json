Sources said the project was expected to be completed by the end of next month.\n\nPraises interior minister, CDA chairman and other officers for development works in Islamabad\n\nEarlier, there was no direct link for traffic coming from Murree and AJK to enter Srinagar Highway. Therefore, motorists would have to go to Kashmir Chowk roundabout to take a turn to entre Srinagar Highway. During this process, often people face traffic mess at the roundabout. Now, people particularly daily travelers from Murree, Bhara Kahu and adjoining areas will have smooth entry to Srinagar Highway. After its completion, traffic will pass through the underpass and vehicles coming from Murree side going towards Faizabad will move directly through link roads.\n\nWork on the project and widening of Murree Road on both sides from near Lake View Park to the underpass continues at a full pace. CDA is executing it as part of Serena Interchange project, which was completed in February this year.\n\nAccording to PC-I, the project is supposed to be completed in 60 days at an estimated cost of Rs900 million and CDA is conducting it as part of the previous contract without calling new tenders.\n\nCDA officials said worth of the Serena Interchange project was Rs4.2 billion and according to the civic agency 15pc expansion of any project was legitimate; therefore, the project is being constructed with a variation of 15pc.\n\nAsked why the tender process was skipped, a CDA officer said, “As per rules and regulations, we can execute this project without a new tender as 15pc variation and extra work is legally covered. So instead of going for a new tendering process, we engaged the existing contractor to save time as this work is part of the Serena Project.” He added that no illegality was involved and before starting the project the matter was placed before the CDA board which unanimously decided that it should be executed as part of the previous contract of Serena Interchange.\n\nWork on the Serena Interchange project worth Rs4.2 billion, which was completed in three months, was inaugurated by Prime Minister Shehbaz in February this year.\n\nEarlier, the interior minister also spoke on the occasion and shared the details of projects with the prime minister. The CDA chairman briefed the PM about the components of the project.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 18th, 2025",
