The second round is set for Saturday in Rome.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened to attack Iran if it does not agree to a deal with the United States over its nuclear programme, which Iran says is peaceful but the West says is aimed at building an atomic bomb.\n\nLavrov said that Russia was “ready to assist, mediate, and play any role that will be beneficial to Iran and the USA”.\n\nMoscow has played a role in Iran’s nuclear negotiations in the past as a veto-wielding UN Security Council member and signatory to an earlier deal that Trump abandoned during his first term in 2018.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei sent Araqchi to Moscow with a letter for President Vladimir Putin to brief the Kremlin about the negotiations.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio said earlier on Friday that the US administration is looking for a peaceful solution with Iran but will never tolerate the country developing a nuclear weapon.",
