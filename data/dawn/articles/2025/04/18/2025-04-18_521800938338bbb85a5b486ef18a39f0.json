  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan Food Authority (BFA) has carried out raids in Quetta, Turbat, Zhob and other districts across the province, as it continues its campaign against adulterated milk and substandard food items.\n\nThe authority’s teams inspected 20 outlets on Thursday, including five milk shops, which were fined during inspections.\n\nAccording to a BFA spokesperson, special inspections were initiated based on public complaints and focused on areas such as Sariab Road, Eastern Bypass, and Satellite Town. One pizza outlet was penalised for multiple violations, including poor storage of both raw and cooked food items, as well as the use of used cooking oil for food preparation.\n\nA bakery was fined for poor hygiene practices, such as using newspapers for packaging, contaminated baking trays, and inadequate personal hygiene among staff. Despite previous warnings, a besan (gram flour) unit was found operating without proper registration or labelling, resulting in the confiscation of a large quantity of substandard products.\n\nIn Turbat and Zhob, BFA’s zonal inspection teams also examined food outlets. Fines were imposed on five bakers, one milk seller for adulteration, one bread seller for selling underweight bread, and one wholesale trader for operating without a licence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 18th, 2025",
