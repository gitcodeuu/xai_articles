The growth was recorded in the import of all machinery except mobile phones.\n\nAccording to the PBS data, crude oil imports increased in the first nine months of FY25, which prompted local refineries to produce more petroleum products than anticipated and boost exports.\n\nPreliminary estimates suggest that the increase in local production of petroleum products in the past few months and its exports from the country is likely to boost economic growth in the current fiscal year.\n\nProduct-wise data showed crude oil imports up 0.36pc during the July-March period this year from a year ago. However, a 14.61pc increase was recorded in the total quantity of petroleum crude to 7.43m tonnes from 6.47m tonnes last year.\n\nThe value of petroleum products imports dipped 3.36pc during the first nine months of the current fiscal year from a year ago. In contrast, a 9.61pc increase was recorded in the total quantity imported, bringing the total up to 7.86m tonnes from 7.17m tonnes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 18th, 2025",
