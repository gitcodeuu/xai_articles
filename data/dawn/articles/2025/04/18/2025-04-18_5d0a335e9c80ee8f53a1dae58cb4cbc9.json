Justice Musarrat Hilali also remarked that the AGP only needed to seek instructions and inform the bench of the government’s stance on the right to appeal.\n\nThe AAG, however, denied any deliberate delay, saying that given the 50-year jurisprudence surrounding military trials, the matter required careful deliberation. He added that the AGP would not present arguments before the bench and would instead adopt the submissions already made by Khawaja Haris, the counsel for the Ministry of Defence.\n\nHowever, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar reminded that the issue regarding the right of appeal was also mentioned in the Oct 23 judgement and therefore it was not something new that had been asked by the court.\n\nJustice Mandokhail observed that when the court martial proceeds in-camera where the media was not present or no live streaming was possible, then how the accused could claim before the Supreme Court or any other appellate forum in appeal that whatever he stated had been recorded faithfully in the evidence.\n\nHe explained that his concern was not limited to the May 9 trials but extended to broader implications for justice. “How can a convict prove that the evidence against him was recorded incorrectly?” he asked.\n\nAt this, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar also supported the observations by the bench, stressing that errors or defects did happen during the trials even by the civilian courts which got rectified in appeals before the appellate courts.\n\n‘Hypothetical observations’\n\nHowever, Khawaja Haris described the judges’ observations as hypothetical, highlighting that 105 accused were tried by the military courts for their involvement in the May 9 acts of arson but not a single accused had ever raised the allegations of bias, lack of fair trial or that he was not provided with a counsel to defend himself during the trial.\n\nThe counsel emphasised that the proceedings in military courts were recorded in writing in accordance with rules where every objection regarding the procedure of the military court was recorded in writing.\n\nHe added that an accused can approach the high court to challenge procedural mala fide, as upheld in the 2017 Said Zaman Khan case.\n\nJustice Mandokhail observed that errors were made by the sessions judge with years of experience during the fair trials, which got rectified by the superior courts in routine cases, though no bias was ever attributed to them against the defendants. Even the Supreme Court has converted death sentences into life terms, he observed.\n\nMr Haris replied that the Pakistan Army Act (PAA) had an in-built mechanism to safeguard the interest of the accused during trials, adding that it would be a rare case to point out mala fide done deliberately against the accused.\n\nJustice Hilali wondered in which building and where the military courts conduct their proceedings. The counsel replied that the information could not be divulged to the public.\n\nWhen the bench asked when arguments would conclude, Mr Haris clarified that he was not offering a rebuttal but was responding to points raised by respondents — points which, he argued, had not been mentioned in their original petitions or in the October judgement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 18th, 2025",
