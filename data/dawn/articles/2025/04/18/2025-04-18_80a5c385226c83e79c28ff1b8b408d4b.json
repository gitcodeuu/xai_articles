Malik had articulated that the JCP meeting’s notice had been issued to convene a meeting on April 18, later rescheduled to April 17 for the appointment/confirmation of the IHC chief justice. Currently, Justice Dogar is the acting CJ. The AGP candidly informed CB that the JCP meeting was ante-dated for deliberating upon a single-item agenda on April 17, i.e., nominations of two more judges in CB.\n\nWhen the court asked the AGP whether any date for the JCP meeting had been fixed for the appointment/confirmation of the IHC CJ, he categorically stated that no such meeting had been scheduled and the notice of the next meeting was issued for May 2 for the appointment/confirmation of Peshawar and Balochistan high courts CJs.\n\nWhen asked to explain the procedure for calling the meeting, the AGP referred to Rule 9 and Rule 10 of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan Rules 2024, saying at least 15 days’ notice was required to be issued to all members of the commission for nominating the prospective candidates.\n\nMuneer A. Malik argued that though the federation had filed the concise statement, the relevant record was not attached. But the AGP undertook to submit the entire record pertaining to the transfer of judges to the IHC through a concise statement, including the summary moved by the Ministry of Law to the prime minister for onward advice to the president for further action in terms of Article 200 of the Constitution.\n\nIHCBA plea\n\nMeanwhile, Advocate on Record (AoR) Anees Mohammad Shahzad told the CB about filing an application to withdraw the petition moved on behalf of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA), since the body was no longer an aggrieved party, especially after the filing of the petition by the high court judges themselves. The association also furnished its April 15 resolution in this regard to substantiate their decision. The court accepted the plea and allowed withdrawal of the petition.\n\nSenior counsel Faisal Siddiqui, who was representing IHCBA, told the CB that he did not file the application for withdrawal, nor was the application moved on his instructions. Former IHCBA president Riasat Ali Azad also told the CB that he had filed the petition after getting approval from the managing committee of the bar.\n\nThe AGP also told the CB he had no instructions in this regard, but he might represent the JCP if asked to do so. At present, he said, he was representing the president and the federal government. He said he would also seek instructions from the registrar of the Supreme Court on whether he wanted to file a concise statement.\n\nThe CB also asked the advocates general of the provinces and the Islamabad Capital Territory to consult the registrars of their respective high courts and file concise statements before the next date of hearing, along with the seniority list maintained by the judges in their respective high courts. The CB will commence daily hearings from Tuesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 18th, 2025",
