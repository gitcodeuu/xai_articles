  "content": "SUMY: A Russian missile strike on Sunday in the Ukraine’s city of Sumy killed at least 34 people, Kyiv said, with European and US officials condemning the attack.\n\nKyiv said Moscow hit the northeastern city, close to the Russian border, with two ballistic missiles on Sunday morning and that the attack also wounded nearly 120 people.\n\nUS President Donald Trump’s special envoy to Ukraine, retired lieutenant general Keith Kellogg, said on X that the attack by Russian forces on civilian targets “crosses any line of decency”.\n\nThe strike came two days after US envoy Steve Witkoff travelled to Russia to meet President Vladimir Putin and push Trump’s efforts to end the war.\n\nThe local emergency service said in its latest bulletin that 34 people died and 117 were wounded.\n\nUS, European leaders condemn Palm Sunday attack on Sumy\n\nBodies were seen covered in silver sheets at the scene of the strike in the city centre, with a destroyed trolleybus. Rescuers worked through the rubble of a building.\n\nThe head of Ukraine’s GUR military intelligence, Kyrylo Budanov, said on Telegram that Russia used two Iskander-M/KN-23 ballistic missiles on Sumy.\n\nOne woman told AFP she heard two explosions. “A lot of people were very badly injured. A lot of corpses,” she said, struggling to speak.\n\nIt was the second Russian attack this month to cause civilian death toll.\n\nTrump has previously voiced anger at Moscow for “bombing like crazy” in Ukraine.\n\nZelensky called on the United States and Europe to give a “strong response” to Russia, adding: “Talking has never stopped ballistic missiles and bombs.” French leader Emmanuel Macron said the strike showed Russia’s “blatant disregard for human lives, international law and the diplomatic efforts of President Trump”.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said he was “appalled” by the attack, which Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni described as a “cowardly” act by Russia.\n\nThe fact that the bloodshed fell on Palm Sunday outraged several leaders.\n\nIt was “a barbaric attack, made even more vile as people gathered peacefully to celebrate Palm Sunday,” European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said on X.\n\n“The Russian version of a ceasefire. Bloody Palm Sunday,” said Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, while Danish leader Mette Frederiksen said the “missile attack on civilians gathered on Palm Sunday… shows Russia’s true face”.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said the killing “as many people made their way to prayer on Palm Sunday” demonstrated that “Putin underscores with blood that he seeks not peace but destruction”.\n\nDutch premier Dick Schoof urged more air defences “so that Ukraine can defend itself against this violence”.\n\nRelentless offensive\n\nRussia did not immediately comment on the strike. Moscow has refused a US-proposed unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nLocal authorities in Sumy published footage of bodies strewn on the street and people running for safety, with cars on fire and wounded civilians on the ground.\n\nRussia has relentlessly attacked Ukraine in recent weeks, extending the violence wrought by its all-out invasion that has gone on for more than three years.\n\nSumy has been under increasing pressure since Moscow pushed back many of Ukraine’s troops from its Kursk region inside Russia, across the border.\n\nKyiv for weeks has warned that Moscow could mount an offensive on Sumy.\n\nRussia launched its invasion partially through the Sumy region and briefly occupied parts of it before being pushed back by Ukrainian forces.\n\nOn Sunday, Russia said it captured another village in eastern Ukraine’s Donetsk region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
