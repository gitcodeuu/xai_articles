With the approval of Palestinian leadership, we will observe a countrywide shutdown strike on April 22.”\n\nHe once again reiterated his demand for the establishment and the political leadership of the country to take the lead in global measures.\n\nHe urged them to invite all like-minded people on a single platform and devise a joint global strategy against the horrible bloodbath in Gaza by Israel.\n\nHe urged the people to take all possible steps to help innocent Palestinians.\n\n“Every deed counts, be it funding, a tweet, a video message, a direct call or anything else,” he reminded the protest participants.\n\nHe said that the world can’t be ruled by ruthless force.\n\nAddressing the “rulers of Pakistan”, he urged them to shun “hypocrisy”.\n\n“The rulers always chant the mantra of economy when they are asked to take drastic steps in the right direction.\n\n“And I ask the leadership of all these three parties — the PPP, PML-N and PTI — that why are they so afraid of raising their voice against America when it comes to Israeli brutalities against innocent Palestinians,” he said.\n\n“You can raise your voice in American parliament for your interests, you can launch lobbying campaigns for your party in America and you can engage with American leaders to address your party issues but you can’t say a word against the illegitimate support of United States to Israel.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
