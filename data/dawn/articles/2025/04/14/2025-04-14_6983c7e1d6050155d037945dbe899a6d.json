From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.\n\nIncidents of violence against women are common across the country. In December 2023, the Asian Development Bank reported in a study that domestic violence was emerging as a silent pandemic in Pakistan, posing a serious challenge to society and the state.",
