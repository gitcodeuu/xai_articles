It said that five soldiers were martyred in exchange of fire with terrorists.\n\nJust six days before the attack on Bannu Cantonment, a suicide bombing took place in Jamia Darul Uloom Haqqani where Maulana Hamidul Haq Haqqani, son of Maulana Samiul Haq and chief of his own faction of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, along with six persons was killed while 18 others were injured.\n\nPledges to share details with media after arrest of perpetrators\n\nOn Sunday, KP police chief said many people were identified in both the cases. “Progress has been made in both the cases and many persons have been identified in Bannu Cantonment attack. They are being investigated. Also, in the case of Nowshera [referring to the suicide attack in Darul Uloom Haqqania] we have obtained evidence,” he told journalists.\n\nHe said that the department was collecting information about the networks behind the attack. He said that details would be shared with media as soon as more people were arrested. He added that the number of terrorist incidents had dropped down due to proactive policing.\n\nThe police chief said that a joint investigation team (JIT) was formed to probe targeted killings of religious scholars, especially in the provincial capital. He said that investigation, based on evidence collected from the spot, led the department to believe that some cases were common. “We have determined that some cases are common,” he said, adding that CCTV footages were obtained and investigation was under way.\n\nAsked about any idea of which network could be behind attack on religious figures, Mr Hameed refused to share details owing to ongoing investigation into the cases.\n\nHe said that a large number of Afghan refugees left for Afghanistan through Torkham border. He added that teams comprising police, special branch of police and revenue officials were formed in every district for remapping of Afghan refugees.\n\nHe said that those teams knocked at doors of houses and illegal Afghan nationals were being repatriated.\n\nAbout the long-awaited safe city project, the provincial police chief said that a team recently visited Lahore and a contract would be signed in next week for the purpose. He said that execution of the project would begin soon. “Safe city project is important to control street crime. Cases are being traced and accused persons are arrested,” he said\n\nHe said that uniform allowance for police personnel was approved by government while salaries were being worked out. He hoped that policeman would hear good news during next financial year.\n\nHe said that federal government was appraised of requirement and shortage of police officers in the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
