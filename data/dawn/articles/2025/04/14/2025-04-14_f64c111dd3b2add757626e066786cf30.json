  "content": "TEHRAN: Iran’s foreign ministry said on Sunday that talks with the United States slated for next weekend will remain “indirect” with Omani mediation, and focused solely on the nuclear issue and lifting of sanctions.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi and US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff held talks on Saturday in Muscat, marking the highest-level Iran-US nuclear negotiations since the collapse of a 2015 accord.\n\nThey agreed to meet again in seven days.\n\n“Negotiations will continue to be indirect. Oman will remain the mediator, but we are discussing the location of future negotiations,” foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei said in an interview with state TV.\n\nHe said the talks would only focus on “the nuclear issue and the lifting of sanctions,” and that Iran “will not have any talks with the American side on any other issue.”\n\nIranian foreign ministry says venue of ‘indirect negotiations’ being decided\n\nAnalysts had said the US would push to include on the agenda discussions over Iran’s ballistic missile programme along with Tehran’s support for the anti-Israel network.\n\nTehran has, however, maintained it will talk only about its nuclear programme.\n\nDonald Trump in 2018 pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers during his first term as US president.\n\nHe reimposed sweeping economic sanctions against Iran, which continued to adhere to the agreement for a year after Washington’s pullout but later began rolling back its own commitments.\n\nIran has consistently denied seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nSaturday’s rare negotiations came weeks after Trump sent a letter to Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei urging nuclear talks while warning of possible military action if Iran refuses.\n\nIran and the US separately described Saturday’s discussions as “constructive”.\n\nIran said the talks were held indirectly with Oman’s foreign minister acting as intermediary. The negotiators, Araghchi and Witkoff, spoke directly for “a few minutes” after the talks, Tehran’s foreign ministry said.\n\nAnother round of talks will be held on April 19.\n\nAsked about the talks, Trump told journalists aboard Air Force One: “I think they’re going OK. Nothing matters until you get it done.”\n\nThe process took place in a “friendly atmosphere”, Omani Foreign Minister Badr Albusaidi said.\n\nSeveral Iranian websites that track the unofficial exchange rate reported on Sunday a strengthening of the Iranian rial to around 850,000 to the US dollar, down from more than one million in recent days.\n\nIran, reeling from Israel’s pummelling of its allies in Gaza and Lebanon, is seeking relief from wide-ranging sanctions hobbling its economy.\n\nTehran has agreed to the meetings despite baulking at Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign of ramping up sanctions and repeated military threats.\n\nOn Sunday, Iranian media largely welcomed the rare talks as a “decisive turning point” in relations between the longtime foes.\n\nIran’s conservative Javan daily praised the US for “not seeking to expand the negotiations to non-nuclear issues”.\n\nThe government-sponsored newspaper, Iran, described the discussions as “constructive and respectful,” quoting Araghchi.\n\nMeanwhile, the reformist Shargh newspaper said it was a “decisive turning point” in Iran-US relations.\n\nThe hardline Kayhan newspaper, which was largely sceptical in the days leading up to the talks, lamented that Iran does not have a “plan B” while there was “no clear prospect for an agreement with Donald Trump.”\n\nIt, however, lauded the fact that the American side did not bring up “the dismantling of nuclear facilities” and “the possibility of a military attack” during the discussions.\n\nTehran and Washington have had no diplomatic relations since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution toppled the CIA-backed Shah.\n\nIran has been wary about engaging in talks with the United States, often citing previous experience and undermined trust.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
