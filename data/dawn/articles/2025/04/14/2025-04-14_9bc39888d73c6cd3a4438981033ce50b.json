  "content": "GWADAR: Local fishermen have warned that the industry and ice factories were fighting for their survival and blamed the government for neglecting the sector contributing billions to the economy.\n\nIn a press conference at the Gwadar Press Club on Sunday, representatives of the fishing industry said the livelihood of millions of workers is under threat.\n\nThey said local fishermen pay hefty bills to the Quetta Electric Supply Company but receive low-voltage electricito only for a few hours each day.\n\nAdditionally, they are forced to spend Rs500,000 to 600,000 every month to purchase water.\n\nDecry power outages, lack of basic facilities in port city\n\nThe fishermen demanded that just like Gwadar was declared a Free Zone, the fish industry should also be included in the Free Zone and granted tax-free status.\n\nWhile they welcomed the prime minister’s recent announcement of reduced electricity prices, they stressed the urgent need to support Gwadar’s struggling fishing sector.\n\nThey highlighted that despite Gwadar being declared the hub of CPEC, fish and ice factories were suffering due to what they called official indifference.\n\nThey emphasised that the fishing industry generates billions in revenue and foreign exchange but receives no facilities in return.\n\nIn a coastal district where 80 per cent of the population relies on fishing, this neglect is especially harmful, they said.\n\nThey accused the government of not fulfilling its promises.\n\nCurrently, around 19 fish and ice factories operate in Gwadar, employing thousands of low-income workers who depend on them for survival.\n\nThe owners decried electricity issues in Gwadar, saying prolonged power outages spoil their fish.\n\nThey called for immediate inclusion of Gwadar’s fish and ice factories in the Free Zone and the provision of essential services.\n\nThe fishermen also urged the Gwadar Development Authority and the Municipal Committee to install proper drainage systems and ensure uninterrupted electricity.\n\nThey warned that failure to meet these demands would severely damage the industry and leave thousands jobless.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
