  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Adiala Road Flyover project worth Rs2.113 billion will miss the completion deadline of April 15 set by the Punjab government due to the slow pace of work by the Communication and Works department.\n\nSo far, only 65 per cent work has been completed.\n\nA senior official of the district administration told Dawn that the project will be completed by May-end as more than 30 per cent work was still pending. He said so far 15 girders have been installed on the pillars. After completing the girders, a test would be conducted which would take a week. He said the communication department had informed the administration that during Ramazan the work slowed down coupled with rain and the Eid holidays.\n\nIf the construction work is sped up, it would compromise on the quality of work, said the official, adding the flyover will be open for traffic by May-end after test rides.\n\nOver 30pc work still pending and project worth Rs2.11bn will be ready by May-end, says official\n\nThe divisional administration wants to complete the work on the flyover as construction on the GPO Chowk underpass has also started, disturbing the overall traffic flow in the garrison city, he added.\n\nThe construction of Adiala Road Flyover at Khawaja Corporation Chowk was launched at a cost of Rs2.113 billion in January. Earlier, the deadline was June end but the provincial government later asked the contractor to complete it by April 15.\n\nThe total length of the flyover is 1915 feet and it will be 52 feet wide with the total length of 16.75 feet. Moreover, 22 feet service roads will be constructed on both sides of the flyover.\n\nAdiala Road is an important access road to the mega Ring Road project. Plans are being worked out to make it wide and signal free.\n\nAbout eight kanals and 11.5 marlas of land has been acquired at a cost of Rs317.623 million for the flyover on Adiala Road.\n\nCommunication and Works Department Superintendent Engineer Rao Tahir was not available to comment despite repeated attempts.\n\nHowever, a senior district official said that the deputy commissioner had directed to complete the project as soon as possible. He said that the concerned departments should utilise all resources to ensure the timely completion of the project.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
