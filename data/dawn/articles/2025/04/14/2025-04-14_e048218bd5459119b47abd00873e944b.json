  "content": "QUETTA: Protest rallies were taken out by Baloch Yakjehti Committee workers and supporters in different areas of Balochistan against the arrest of Dr Mahrang Baloch, Beebu Baloch and other leaders on Sunday.\n\nThe call for demonstrations and rallies in 20 towns and cities including Quetta was given by BYC leadership. However, a rally could not be taken out in Quetta where the local administration had deployed a heavy contingent of police which did not allow the BYC workers to come on the road.\n\nRallies were taken out in Pansi, Turbat, Gwadar, Noshki, Kalat, Mastung, Khuzdar, Hub, Bela, Dalbandin, Sibi, Kharan, Jiwani and other areas. The participants of the rallies marched on various streets carrying placards and banners inscribed with their demands. They chanted slogans against the government and demanded release of Dr Mahrang and other arrested workers and leaders of the BYC.\n\nMeanwhile, the protest sit-in of Balochistan National Party-Mengal against the arrest of BYC chief organiser Dr Mahrang and others entered its 16th day.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
