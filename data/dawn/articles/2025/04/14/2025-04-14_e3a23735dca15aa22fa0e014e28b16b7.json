  "content": "HARIPUR: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf provincial president MNA Junaid Akbar Khan has said that his party workers are ready to take to streets anytime across the country in the current month for release of their jailed leader Imran Khan.\n\nHe was addressing a workers convention here on Sunday. Leader of Opposition in National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan, Provincial Minister Arshad Ayub Khan, MPA Akbar Ayub Khan, MNAs Ali Asghar Khan, Ali Khan Jadoon were also present on the occasion.\n\nMr Akbar said that after last November’s “state oppression” there was a common perception among their opponents that PTI workers would cow down but it proved wrong. “Our workers are more enthusiastic than the previous call and have diluted the impression that they could be scared away by registering FIRs and kidnappings. They are ready for every sacrifice for their leader,” he claimed. He added that PTI could not be dismantled but its opponents would soon get tired.\n\nAbout their next agitation, he said that they were waiting for the call from leadership to take to streets for the release of their incarcerated leader and PTI founder Imran Khan. “State would be responsible if PTI’s youth decided to agitate without their leadership as they are now fed up,” he said.\n\nClaims he was denied permission to meet Imran\n\nHe said that he made 16 attempts to meet Imran Khan but Adiala Jail administration did not allow him. He hoped that he would soon have a detailed meeting with Imran Khan and have his final word for next protest call.\n\nMr Akbar said that the state was not a mere piece of a geographical boundary that could stay intact with the power of stick and oppression. “The hatred that is being sown against state institutions is visible in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is not a good omen and could force youth to take to streets and the responsibility of consequences would rest with state,” he warned.\n\nHe said that in the prevailing circumstances he had lost confidence in parliament and democracy despite being a democrat and member of parliament. He alleged that PTI’s mandate was stolen and its workers and leaders were branded as terrorists to stop demanding release of their leader but the country’s future hinged on the leadership of Imran Khan.\n\nThe PTI leader claimed that despite all pressure tactics, the popularity graph of Imran Khan and his party was on the rise. He also came down hard on the federal government and termed it inept.\n\nOmar Ayub Khan and MNAs Ali Khan Jadoon and Ali Asghar Khan also spoke on the occasion.\n\nLater, Junaid Akbar also visited Havelian and addressed party workers there.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
