  "content": "KARACHI: At a big rally in Karachi to condemn Israeli brutalities in Gaza on Sunday, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman warned that if anyone attempted to recognise Israel or establish political or economic ties with the illegitimate Zionist country, they would face dire consequences.\n\nThe JUI-F chief anno­unced a “million march” in Lahore on April 27 to show solidarity with the people of Palestine.\n\nAddressing the rally on Shahrah-i-Quaideen, the JUI-F chief said that the people of Pakistan would gather at Minar-i-Pakistan on April 27 to condemn the Israeli aggression.\n\n“Our struggle will continue in solidarity with the people of Palestine. Anyone attempting to recognise Israel or establish political or economic ties with it will face dire consequences — we will break their legs,” he warned.\n\nHe said that the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, had a clear stance on Israel, declaring it an illegitimate state.\n\n“No one will be allowed to deviate from this position,” he warned.\n\nThe Maulana also expre­ssed support for a declaration of Jihad issued by scholars under the platform of Majlis Itte­had-i-Ummat Pakistan.\n\n“We endorse this call. Supporting Gaza’s Mus­lims through moral, diplomatic, and all forms of aid is a religious duty for all of us,” he said.\n\nThe JUI-F chief also said that their rally sent a message of courage to the Arab world and Gaza, and that Palestinians were not alone, and the people of Pakistan were standing with them.\n\n“Over 70,000 people, including women and children, had been killed in Gaza, but Muslim leaders were still acting like puppets of the US and remained silent,” he said.\n\n“Israel is not a legitimate state; it is an occupier. For 77 years, it has unlawfully taken over Palestinians’ land,” he reminded the rally.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 14th, 2025",
