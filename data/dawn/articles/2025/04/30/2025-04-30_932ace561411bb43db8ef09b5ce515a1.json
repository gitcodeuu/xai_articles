They are the architects of our digital future,” he said.\n\nReaffirms commitment to position Pakistan as next major tech destination at digital FDI conference\n\nThe premier highlighted the government’s strategic initiatives, including the launch of federal and provincial IT parks, incubation centres and a large-scale R&D ecosystem.\n\nHe announced a new partnership with global technology giant Huawei, which will train 200,000 boys and girls annually through a joint skill development programme.
