He offered his good offices to support de-escalation efforts,” spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.\n\nAccording to the PM Office in Islamabad, during their telephone call, PM Shehbaz rejected the Indian accusations as bas­e­less and categorica­lly rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident.\n\nHe reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral investigation into the incident, and expre­ssed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of “terrorism”, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in the occupied territory.\n\nHe also pointed to India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as being unacceptable as it was the lifeline of around 240 million people.\n\nNo airport closures\n\nAmid fears of airspace closures due to rising tensions with India, rumours of a possible closure of airports began circulating on social media on Tuesday night.\n\nHowever, authorities confirmed that this was not true, and both domestic and international flight operations continued as usual.\n\nFor example, a flight from Islamabad to Doha departed on Wednesday at around 12.40am.\n\nAccording to flight information at Islamabad International Airport (IIAP), another flight arrived from Sharjah at 11:43pm on Tuesday night.\n\nA senior official at IIAP told Dawn the airport was fully functional for both domestic and international flights, while an official from Lahore airport also confirmed that flight operations were running smoothly.\n\nMohammad Asghar in Rawalpindi and Anwar Iqbal in Washington also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 30th, 2025",
