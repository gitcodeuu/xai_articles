  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday warned police against violation of its orders regarding ban on media interviews of under-custody suspects.\n\nJustice Ali Zia Bajwa remarked that violation of court orders will not be tolerated under any circumstances.\n\nThe judge was hearing a case regarding the incidents of sharing videos of detainees by the police of Kasur and Lahore.\n\n“Who allows access to the arrested suspects? Who permits entry into police stations?” the judge questioned.\n\nJustice Bajwa referred to the social media policy adopted by the London Metropolitan police, asking the government officials whether they give media access to arrested suspects.\n\nDuring the hearing, two anchorpersons of a private news channel appeared before the court to explain their positions on interviews of arrested persons they conducted inside the police stations.\n\nThe judge directed both anchorpersons to act with caution in future and withdrew the contempt proceedings against them.\n\nA suspended station house officer of Kasur also offered an apology in a contempt of court case related to the viral video of women and men arrested from a farmhouse.\n\nThe judge directed the SHO to submit a written apology.\n\nProsecutor General of Punjab Syed Farhad Ali Shah told the court that following the chief minister’s notice, a high-powered committee was investigating the Kasur incident. He assured the court that those responsible will be held accountable.\n\nJustice Bajwa observed that in light of the chief minister’s proactive steps, the contempt proceedings were being withdrawn.\n\nThe judge expressed his dissatisfaction with the social media rules submitted in the court by the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).\n\nThe judge adjourned further hearing for progress reports from the government and the police.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 30th, 2025",
