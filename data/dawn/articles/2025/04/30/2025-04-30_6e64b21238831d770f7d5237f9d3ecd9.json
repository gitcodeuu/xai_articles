Earlier, at least three senators, Allama Nasir Abbas, Gurdeep Singh and Dost Muhammad, called for the release of Imran Khan from the Adiala jail.\n\nHowever, PML-N Senator Nasir Butt said Imran Khan would have to face the law and prove his innocence to secure his freedom.\n\nSenator Saifullah Abro of the PTI chided former prime minister Nawaz Sharif for his purported silence over the Pahalgam attack and demanded that the political leadership make strong statements over the issue.\n\nStern response\n\nMeanwhile, FM Ishaq Dar said Pakis­tan would pay back India in the same coin, but it would not initiate an attack.\n\nSharing details of Pakistan’s diplomatic overtures following the escalation in the aftermath of the Pahalgam attack, he said foreign ministers of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, China, the United Kingdom, Turkiye, Azerbaijan, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Hungary have been taken on board about Pakistan’s concerns.\n\nHe said he also spoke directly to the prime minister of Qatar. Mr Dar praised China and Turkiye for expressing clear support for Pakistan in the wake of the crisis.\n\n“I walked them through what happened — India’s psyche, its history and our concerns about what intentions it may have in light of that history,” he told the House. Mr Dar said intelligence reports suggest that India was contemplating some form of escalation.\n\nReferring to the 2019 Pulwama attack that killed 40 Indian paramilitary personnel and was blamed on a Pakistan-based militant group, the deputy prime minister noted that New Delhi had used the incident as a pretext to revoke Article 370 of its constitution, which granted special status to Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe region was subsequently absorbed into India’s union territory framework, a move Pakistan has repeatedly condemned. Ishaq Dar also said that India had been attempting to alter the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which determined the water-sharing mechanism between both countries, for the past two years, citing changing circumstances.\n\n“I have my doubts, much like other people, that this drama was staged to suspend this treaty,” he said while referring to the Pahalgam attack. He said there was no evidence that it was a false-flag operation. “What we do say with full confidence is that Pakistan has nothing to do with this [attack].”\n\nAccording to Mr Dar, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an independent investigation into the Pahalgam attack fully knowing that Pakistan had nothing to do with it. He also made it clear that any meddling with Pakistani waters by India will not be tolerated at any cost and will be taken as an act of war.\n\nMeanwhile, the House unanimously passed “The Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention (Implementation) Bill, 2025” and “The National Commission for Minorities’ Rights Bill 2025 brought before it as a supplementary agenda.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 30th, 2025",
