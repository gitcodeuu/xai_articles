  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Tuesday allowed post-arrest bail to a man accused of uploading fake videos of Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari on social media.\n\nChief Justice Aalia Neelum issued the reserved verdict on the bail petition filed by Ali Hassan Toor, who had been arrested by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).\n\nThe chief justice had reserved the verdict on Monday after hearing the arguments from all sides.\n\nShe allowed the bail to the suspect subject to furnishing surety bonds worth Rs1 million.\n\nA counsel for the minister had opposed the bail, saying the FIA declared the suspect guilty.\n\nA deputy attorney general also stated that the suspect shared a fake video with commentary, which constitutes a crime under the law.\n\nHowever, the chief justice observed that uploading a personal video and mentioning someone in it were two different matters.\n\nThe petitioner`s counsel argued that the suspect did not share even a single fake video from his account.\n\nThe counsel further submitted that he would withdraw the bail petition if it was proven that the suspect had shared the fake video.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 30th, 2025",
