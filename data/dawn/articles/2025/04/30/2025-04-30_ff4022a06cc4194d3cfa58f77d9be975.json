The list included Salman Safdar, Gohar Khan, Naeem Haider Panjutha, Abuzar Salman Niazi, Niazullah Niazi, and Zaheer Abbas.\n\nOnly two individuals — Zaheer Abbas, whose name was on the approved list, and Faisal Chaudhry — were granted access to the former prime minister.\n\nBushra receiving special facilities in jail, IHC told\n\nNiazullah Niazi, speaking to Dawn, said that since his appointment as spokesperson for Imran Khan on March 24, he had been allowed to meet the PTI founding chairman only twice.\n\n“After the initial meetings, I have not been permitted to meet him, simply because I conveyed Imran Khan’s message without altering it. The same situation applies to Salman Akram Raja,” he alleged.\n\nSpecial amenities\n\nMeanwhile, during proceedings on a petition regarding better prison facilities for Bushra Bibi, the Islamabad High Court was informed that the former first lady was receiving special amenities at Adiala Jail.\n\nJustice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas presided over the hearing, during which the Adiala Jail Superintendent’s report was submitted through the Advocate General’s Office.\n\nAccording to the report, Bushra Bibi is accommodated in a spacious, separate room that allows her space for movement and walking.\n\nShe has been provided with a mattress, chair, table, bookcase, lighting, fan, room cooler and an LCD television.\n\nA separate kitchen has also been allocated to her, with meals inspected by a medical officer before being served to ensure safety and hygiene.\n\nA female medical examiner conducts health checks twice daily, the report added. Additionally, Bushra Bibi has access to a private bathroom equipped with a commode, washbasin and shower.\n\nThe court was informed that she meets her family members, friends and legal team regularly without any hindrance. Her lawyers, Chaudhry Zaheer Abbas and Usman Riaz Gul, were present at the hearing.\n\nJustice Minhas directed that a copy of the superintendent’s report be shared with the petitioner’s counsel, who will submit their response at the next hearing. The Registrar’s Office will set the next date for proceedings.\n\nThe report stated that prisoners entitled to enhanced facilities may receive such privileges through the Punjab government’s Home Department.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 30th, 2025",
