Prominent Baloch activists have also been placed on the “Exit Control List”, barring them from leaving the country.\n\nThe experts also urged the government to reconsider proposed amendments to preventive detention laws, warning of the risk of arbitrary deprivation of liberty, which is already extensively used against activists and human rights defenders, including women.\n\n“Proposed new internment centres for terrorism suspects in Balochistan could also lead to gross human rights violations, including arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and torture,” they said.\n\nThe experts called for a thorough review and amendment of these laws, proposals and practices to ensure full respect for international human rights law.\n\n“Pakistan must also increase its efforts to address grievances in Balochistan that may fuel violence,” the experts said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 30th, 2025",
