About a dozen people suffered burn injuries and were undergoing treatment.\n\nBuilding fires are common in India due to a lack of firefighting equipment and a routine disregard for safety regulations. Last year, six people were killed in a fire at a hotel in Patna in the eastern state of Bihar.\n\nThe Press Trust of India news agency, which filmed images of soaring flames from the Kolkata building, reported that “several people were seen trying to escape through the windows and narrow ledges of the building”.\n\nKolkata’s The Telegraph newspaper reported that at least one person died when he “jumped off the terrace trying to escape” the fire.\n\nVerma said the fire had been tackled and that “cooling operations are underway”.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi offered his condolences to the families of those killed. “May the injured recover soon,” his office said in a statement.\n\nKolkata, a bustling metropolis of more than 15 million people, is the capital of West Bengal state, which is governed by the opposition Trinamool Congress party.",
