Fellow spinner Nayeem Hasan finished with 2-42.\n\nZimbabwe collapsed from a comfortable 177-2 during Monday’s final session, losing their last eight wickets for 50 runs.\n\nSean Williams with 67 was Zimbabwe’s top scorer and Nick Welch made 54 after captain Craig Ervine won the toss and opted to bat.\n\nZimbabwe are 1-0 up in the two-Test series after winning the opener in Sylhet by three wickets.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nZIMBABWE (1st Innings, overnight 227-9):\n\nB.
