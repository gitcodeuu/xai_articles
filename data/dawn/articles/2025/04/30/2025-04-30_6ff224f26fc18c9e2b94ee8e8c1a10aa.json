  "content": "LAHORE: These were desperate times for Multan Sultans and Khurram Shehzad’s two-wicket bursts in the second and fourth overs of their innings had them reeling. Having lost five of their six matches so far in this Pakistan Super League season, and two on the bounce, they were gasping for air in stifling conditions; looking for some inspiration.\n\nThe Quetta Gladiators, on a two-game winning streak, had their tails up and they would give the Sultans no way out; Fah­eem Ashraf picking a wicket each in his first two overs. Two days after ripping apart Peshawar Zal­mi, they scythed through the Sultans and bundled them out for 89 with only skipper Mohammad Rizwan offering a semblance of resistance.\n\nThe Gladiators then cruised to their target off just 41 balls without losing a wicket — skipper Saud Shakeel hitting four sixes and three fours in a 20-ball 42 and Finn Allen striking five sixes and two fours in a 21-ball 45 — to climb up to second place in the standings.\n\nOn a pitch laid using soil from Western Australia and offering bounce, the Sultans — who are now only mathematically in the playoffs race — never got going after they had been put into bat.\n\nFast bowler Khurram (4-23) struck with the first ball he delivered; opener Yasir Khan spooning a catch to Mohammad Wasim Jr at mid-on. Three balls later, he was followed by Usman Khan, who tried to hit his way out of pressure but only found Mohammad Amir at mid-on.\n\nThe incoming Kamran Ghulam saw Hassan Nawaz drop a sitter on the last ball of the third over but was gone next ball as Khurram returned to have him caught at slip and then had Curtis Campher lbw four balls later; the Sultans in all sorts of trouble at 20-4 before ending the powerplay with no further losses but the scoreboard reading just 31.\n\nOpener Rizwan was running out of partners and soon lost another when Faheem — on the back of a five-wicket haul against Zalmi — came into the attack; Iftikhar Ahmed going long only to be caught in the deep in the eighth over before Michael Bracewell edged to the keeper in the 10th as the Sultans reached the midway point of their innings at 47-6.\n\nSuch was the Gladiators’ dominance that the Sultans couldn’t even capitalise on missed chances. Abrar Ahmed had dropped David Willey in the 12th over off Mohammad Amir but made amends when he settled under a skier from the Englishman in the next over by Wasim.\n\nNumber eight batter Usama Mir finally got the first six of the innings in the 14th over, hitting Faheem over the square leg fence, having cut the bowler away for four the previous delivery as the Sultans looked for a late flourish.\n\nBut Usama (11), the only Sultans batter to reach double figures apart from Rizwan, was run out on the first ball of the next over. Another run out followed soon after, seeing Mohammad Hasnain return to the dugout.\n\nRizwan, who made a painstaking run-a-ball 44 not out with just four fours, pulled away Wasim for the only six of his stay but the fast bowler soon put the Sultans out of their misery when he had last man Ubaid Shah caught behind with the last ball of the 17th over.\n\nQuetta began their chase tentatively, just eight runs coming off the first two overs with just one four by Allen. But once they made sure there were no demons on the pitch, the Sultans were thrashed to all parts; Allen depositing Willey for two sixes and a four in the third over and Saud getting a six and a four off the next by Hasnain.\n\nAny flickering Sultans hopes had been extinguished and as Saud got going, it became a matter of how soon the Gladiators would win. Ubaid was hit for two sixes and a four in the fifth over by Saud, who then hit another six and a four off the sixth over by Hasnain.\n\nAllen also hit a six in the same over as the Gladiators ended the powerplay at 74-0 before the New Zealander ended the game with a couple more big hits off Usama in the seventh over.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nMULTAN SULTANS:\n\nYasir Khan c Wasim b Khurram 5\n\nMohammad Rizwan not out 44\n\nUsman Khan c Amir b Khurram 0\n\nKamran Ghulam c Allen b Khurram 3\n\nCurtis Campher lbw b Khurram 4\n\nIftikhar Ahmed c Rossouw b Faheem 6\n\nMichael Bracewell c Mendis b Faheem 0\n\nDavid Willey c Abrar b Wasim 7\n\nUsama Mir run out (Rossouw) 11\n\nMohammad Hasnain run out (Hasan) 2\n\nUbaid Shah c Mendis b Wasim 1\n\nEXTRAS (W-6) 6\n\nTOTAL (all out, 17 overs)89\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-7 (Yasir), 2-12 (Usman), 3-16 (Kamran), 4-20 (Campher), 5-37 (Iftikhar), 6-43 (Bracewell), 7-60 (Willey), 8-73 (Usama), 9-76 (Hasnain)\n\nBOWLING: Amir 3-0-14-0, Khurram 4-0-23-4 (2w), Wasim 4-0-18-2, Faheem 3-0-21-2, Abrar 3-0-13-0\n\nQUETTA GLADIATORS:\n\nSaud Shakeel not out 42\n\nFinn Allen not out 45\n\nEXTRAS (W-3) 3\n\nTOTAL (for no wicket, 6.5 overs) 90\n\nDID NOT BAT: Rilee Rossouw, Kusal Mendis, Mark Chapman, Faheem Ashraf, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Wasim, Mohammad Amir, Khurram Shahzad, Abrar Ahmed\n\nBOWLING: Willey 2-0-22-0, Hasnain 3-0-35-0 (3w), Ubaid 1-0-17-0, Usama 0.5-0-16-0\n\nRESULT: Quetta Gladiators won by 10 wickets.\n\nPLAYER-OF-THE-MATCH: Khurram Shahzad\n\nCURRENT STANDING\n\nTabulated under (Teams, matches, wins, losses, points, net run-rate)\n\nUnited 5 5 0 10 2.342\n\nGladiators 6 4 2 8 1.034\n\nQalandars 6 3 3 6 0.543\n\nKings 6 3 3 6 -0.217\n\nZalmi 6 2 4 4 -0.847\n\nSultans 7 1 6 2 -2.355\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 30th, 2025",
