A veteran of national politics, he was also a renowned playwright, mathematician, and a versatile scholar whose contributions extended well beyond the political realm, the resolution said.\n\nThe other resolution said Prof Ahmad was a distinguished economist, eminent Islamic scholar, and a dedicated statesman whose intellectual legacy and public contributions have left a lasting impact on Pakistan.\n\nHis scholarly work on Islamic economics and ideology has been widely recognised both nationally and internationally.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 16th, 2025",
