It results in a sudden release of water, threatening mountainous communities.\n\nThe advisory sent to deputy commissioners of these districts stated that PMD has warned of an increased risk of Glofs in low-lying glaciated areas of KP from Wednesday (today) due to a significant rise in temperatures.\n\n“The persistent high temperatures may accelerate snow and glacier melt and subsequent weather events, potentially triggering Glof incidents in vulnerable valleys and surrounding regions during the current and upcoming week,” the advisory said.\n\nPMDA has asked district administrations to take precautionary measures to avoid any loss of life and livestock and damages to infrastructure and crops. It also asked the relevant authorities to warn local communities of the risk and ensure the availability of emergency and rescue services personnel to deal with any emergency situation.\n\nThe advisory also warned tourists to avoid unnecessary travel to these areas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 16th, 2025",
