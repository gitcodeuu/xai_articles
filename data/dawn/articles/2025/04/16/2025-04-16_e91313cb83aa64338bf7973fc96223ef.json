  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Tuesday reiterated its last order to the anti-terrorism courts (ATCs) to conclude May 9 violence trials within four months.\n\nHeaded by Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi, a three-judge SC bench had taken up appeals in cases moved by Punjab prosecutor general to cancel bails or transfer cases of suspects involved in the May 9 incidents.\n\nThe court dismissed Asad Qaiser’s bail cancellation appeal on the basis of its withdrawal.\n\nWhile hearing the pre-arrest bail applications of PTI leaders Farhat Abbas and Imtiaz Sheikh, the Supreme Court granted interim bail to the former against a surety bond of Rs50,000 and extended the interim bail of latter till Thursday.\n\nWhen the hearing on Mr Qaiser’s bail cancellation appeal began, the ad­­ditional advocate gene­ral Khyber Pakhtunkhwa told the court it was withdrawing the appeal. Subsequently, the court dismissed the ap­­p­eal.\n\nDeadline challenges\n\nDuring the hearing, senior counsel Babar Awan representing Muh­ammad Fahim Qaiser, an accused in the May 9 incidents, apprised the court how PTI workers were facing difficulties due to court order of completing trials against them within four months.\n\nSome accused are corn vendors, some are cobblers and shoe polishers but have to travel 200km to appear before court, Mr Awan said, while requesting the SC to order holding their trials in Mianwali instead of Sargodha.\n\nThe CJP noted it was not for the court to decide where the case should be held, rather the trial court should decide about it by itself.\n\nWhen Mr Awan requested the court to quash FIRs against the accused, CJP Afridi replied that relevant forums should be approached for it.\n\nThe CJP reminded him that the antiterrorism law mentions completing the trial in three months, adding that the court will also mention a deadline date for completing the trial in the written order.\n\nOn Wednesday, a CJP-led three-judge SC bench will hear a number of cases in­­cluding appeals by the Punjab prosecutor gene­ral relating to not granting of physical remand of PTI founder Imran Khan, appeals against restoration of Mr Khan’s pre-arrest bail, appeals reg­a­rding his physical remand and other challenges.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 16th, 2025",
