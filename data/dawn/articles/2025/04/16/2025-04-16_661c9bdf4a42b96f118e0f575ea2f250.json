He also threatened to strip the university of its tax-exempt status as a nonprofit educational institution.\n\nHis campaign against the intellectual elite is echoed in similar, unprecedented pressure campaigns against top law firms and big media groups, including The Associated Press.\n\nDemonstrating the broadening resonance of the row, Golden State Warriors basketball coach Steve Kerr spoke out in support of Harvard after his team defeated the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nKerr, sporting a Harvard T-shirt, called the demands on the university the “dumbest thing I’ve ever heard”.\n\n“I believe in academic freedom and I think it’s crucial for all of our institutions to be able to handle their own business the way they want to, and they should not be shaken down and told what to teach and what to say by our government,” Kerr said.\n\nThe payments frozen to Harvard are for government contracts with its leading research programmes, mostly in the medical field, where the school’s laboratories are critical players in the development of new medicines and treatments.\n\nTrump and his White House team have publicly justified their campaign against universities as a reaction to what they say is uncontrolled anti-Semitism and a need to reverse diversity programmes aimed at encouraging minorities.\n\nThe anti-Semitism allegations are based on controversy over protests against Israel’s conflict in Gaza that swept across US college campuses last year.\n\nColumbia University in New York — an epicentre of the protests — stood down last month and agreed to oversight of its Middle Eastern studies department after being threatened with a loss of $400 million in federal funds.\n\nThe claims about diversity tap into long-standing conservative complaints that US university campuses are too liberal, shutting out right-wing voices and giving preference to Black and other minority groups over whites.\n\nIn the case of Harvard, the White House is seeking unprecedented levels of government control over the inner workings of the country’s oldest and wealthiest university — and one of the most respected educational and research institutions in the world.\n\nIn a letter sent to Harvard, the administration’s demands included ending admissions that take into account the student’s race or national origins; preventing admission of foreign students “hostile to the American values and institutions”; ending staff hiring based on race, religion, sex or national origin; reducing power of students in campus governance; auditing students and staff for “viewpoint diversity”; reforming entire programmes for “egregious records of anti-Semitism or other bias”; and cracking down on campus protests.",
