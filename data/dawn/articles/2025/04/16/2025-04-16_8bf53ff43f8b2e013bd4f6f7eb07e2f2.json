  "content": "KARACHI: The Natio­nal Bank said on Tuesday that its teams are actively engaged in stabilising all systems, and every effort is being made to restore services to full normalcy as swiftly as possible.\n\nThe largest bank in the country was updating the software and had announced that it would restore the services by Monday at 8pm. However, the customers faced problems while trying to use online services or ATMs, which were generally not functioning till 8.30pm on Tuesday.\n\nNBP said the bank had obtained scheduled downtime permission until 4:00pm April 14 to facilitate the rollout of a major core banking system upgrade.\n\n“Despite the scale of this transition, NBP branches remained operational and continued to serve customers effectively both April 14 and April 15. ATM services also remained operational technically throughout,” NBP said in press release.\n\nFollowing the upgrade, some intermittent disruptions have been observed across alternative delivery channels. These are partly expected during a transformation of this magnitude and, in certain cases, are being managed to balance system load and ensure service continuity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 16th, 2025",
