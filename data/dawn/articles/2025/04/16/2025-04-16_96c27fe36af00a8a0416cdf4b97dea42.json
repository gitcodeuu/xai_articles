A victory in this match will help the hosts qualify for the World Cup. The Pakistan women play their last match of the Qualifier against Bangladesh on April 19. Bangladesh in their next game take on West Indies on Thursday.\n\nAfter electing to bat first, Bangladesh totalled a solid 276 for six off the allotted overs thanks to solid batting display from top-scorer Nigar Sultana (83 off 59 balls) and half-centuries from opener Fargana Hoque and Sharmin Akhter, who scored 57 runs each.\n\nThe second-wicket stand between Fargana and Sharmin produced 103 runs off 127 balls while captain Nigar and Fahima Khatun (26 off 22) collected 61 runs for the sixth wicket off just 44 balls to finish the innings with a fighting total.\n\nMedium-pacer Kathryn Bryce claimed two wickets for 53 from nine overs.\n\nScotland, in response, never looked in the game while losing wickets regularly. Among the top six batters, only wicket-keeper/batter Sarah Bryce made a meaningful 42-run contribution while the rest struggled.\n\nAfter they slumped to 110-7 in the 28th over, Priyanaz Chatterji and Rachel Slater, who scored 61 runs each, in a rearguard action added 115 runs in 20.4 overs to bring some life into the game but it was too late. At 225-7 in the 48th over, Chatterji was dismissed by slow left-arm orthodox spinner Nahida Akter who in the same over sent back Chloe Abel back to the pavilion as Scotland ended their innings at 242-9.\n\nNahida claimed four wickets for 40 while off-spinner Jannatul Ferdus also grabbed two wickets for 43.\n\nNigar was named player-of-the-match.\n\nIRELAND DOWN THAILAND\n\nIn the day match held on Tuesday, a five-wicket haul by pacer Louise Little and half-centuries from Amy Hun­ter, captain Gaby Lewis and Leah Paul guided Ireland to a 46-run win against Thailand at the LCCA ground.\n\nThis was Ireland’s first victory in the event though the match had no impact on deciding the top two teams of the Qualifier.\n\nAfter electing to bat first, Ireland piled up 305-4 — the biggest total of the event so far — in the stipulated 50 overs.\n\nHaving lost all their three matches in the event, Thailand fought well in this game and managed to post 259 in 49.1 overs.\n\nThailand batters Suwanan Khiaoto (59 off 50 balls), Phannita Maya (43 off 61) and captain Naruemol Chaiwai (37 off 39) rescued Thailand after they were restricted to 76-4 in the 18 overs.\n\nChaiwai and Maya added 90 runs for the fifth wicket to keep their chase on track before both fell in quick succession at the total of 166.\n\nChaiwai was clean bowled by Sophie MacMahon and Maya became the first victim of Louise Little, caught by Leah Paul.\n\nThailand crumbled to 182-7 when Onnicha Kamchomphu was cleaned up by Little in the 37th over.\n\nStanding firm, Khiaoto then added 71 runs for the eighth wicket with Thipatcha Putthawong (22 off 36).\n\nAfter losing Putthawong and next batter Sunida Chaturongrattana (0) at the total of 253, Khiaoto was the last woman dismissed by medium-pacer Little.\n\nLittle claimed five wickets for 28 runs in her 9.1 overs to earn the player-of-the-match honours while debutant off-spinner Kia McCartney took two wickets for 73.\n\nEarlier batting first, openers Lewis and Sarah Forbes gave Ireland a rollicking 88-run start in 16 overs.\n\nWhen Forbes was clean bowled by Suleemporn Laomi for a 35-ball 29, Lewis found another reliable partner in Amy Hunter (76 off 71) as they added 56 runs.\n\nAt the total of 144, Lewis was caught by wicket-keeper Khiaoto off Putthawong for an 89-ball 75 in the 26th over.\n\nHunter and Orla Prendergast (21) added 43 runs before the latter was run out due to a mix-up.\n\nHunter was clean bowled by Chanida Sutthiruang for a polished 71-ball 76 in the 40th over at the total of 218.\n\nLeah Paul (67 not out off 40) and Laura Delany (23 not out off 33) added an invaluable 87 runs from the last 10.2 overs to help Ireland post a big total.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 16th, 2025",
