  "content": "PESHAWAR: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chapter has constituted a committee of parliamentarians to conduct a comprehensive review of the Mines and Minerals Bill amid ongoing controversy over the proposed legislation.\n\nThe committee consists of three MNAs, including PTI provincial general secretary Ali Asghar Khan as the head and Dr Amjad Ali Khan from Swat and Arbab Sher Ali Khan from Peshawar as members.\n\n“In view of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Minerals Bill, 2025, and the broad-based interest, concern and feedback, PTI KP has constituted a three-member committee to conduct a comprehensive review of the legislation,” read a notification issued by the media on Tuesday.\n\nTalking to Dawn, Mr Asghar said the committee would produce a report on the proposed law, including recommendations, for the consideration of the provincial government.\n\nPanel head says we’ll move on in light of Imran’s directions\n\n“Obviously, our report and suggestions will also be presented to PTI founder Imran Khan,” he said.\n\nThe lawmaker said that the committee would suggest “amendments and deletions for the draft legislation in the larger interest of the locals and nation as well.”\n\nHe said that the committee would suggest incorporating additional clauses regarding interests of residents in the mining areas.\n\n“We will make all-out efforts to bring clarity to the bill regarding the shares of the locals in the mining sector and for the protection of their rights.All aspects of the bill will be presented to Imran Khan. We will move on in light of his directions,” he said.\n\nHe said in the preparation of the report, the committee would engage the relevant experts.\n\n“The committee has been tasked with reviewing the bill in detail, identifying gaps or ambiguities, and developing recommendations to strengthen transparency, protect provincial autonomy, uphold community rights and ensure the law serves the broader public interest,” read the notification.\n\nIt added that the committee might engage with relevant stakeholders including legal experts, community leaders and subject specialists to inform its work.\n\nThe notification said that following preliminary review and the concerns expressed, it was clear that further clarification and potential amendments are necessary.\n\n“The committee that has already begun deliberations shall very soon be submitting its findings and proposals to the KP government and the central leadership of PTI. The PTI strongly recommends that no final approval of the bill, whether partial or complete, be granted without first reviewing the bill in light of these findings and recommendations and then, as decided by the political committee of the party, consulting Imran Khan. His direction and decision as all agree is crucial to determine if and how the bill should be brought before the provincial assembly.”\n\nThe speaker of the KP Assembly on Tuesday adjourned the sitting of the house until April 23, which was called for Wednesday (today), apparently to avoid criticism of the lawmakers from both sides of the aisle over the proposed law.\n\nOn Monday, members of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly from the ruling PTI rebelled against their own government and boycotted official briefing on the controversial Mines and Minerals Bill, 2025.They declared that the proposed law would be acceptable only if it was approved by the incarcerated party founder and former prime minister, Imran Khan.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Bill, 2025, was approved by the provincial cabinet last February and tabled in the assembly on March 4.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 16th, 2025",
