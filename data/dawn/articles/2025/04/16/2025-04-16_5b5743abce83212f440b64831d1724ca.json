Upgrading infrastructure and initiating new projects is essential for unlocking their full economic potential,” the minister said, assuring the visiting delegation of the government’s full support for viable proposals.\n\nA key item on the agenda was the installation of seawater desalination plants at Port Qasim. The Chinese delegation expressed interest in investing in water treatment facilities that could serve both industrial and residential needs in the areas where water scarcity is a pressing issue.\n\n“These proposed desalination projects could provide much-needed clean water and support local industry,” the minister said, adding that the initiative aligns with Pakistan’s environmental sustainability and climate resilience goals.\n\nWang Yaodong, who led the delegation, emphasised his company’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s sustainable infrastructure development. “We are ready to bring advanced technology and investment to projects that improve daily life and drive economic growth. Desalination is one such area where we can make a tangible difference,” Wang stated.\n\nThe delegation also showed interest in highway development projects aimed at improving connectivity between ports and economic zones.\n\nImproved road infrastructure, both parties agreed, would enhance trade efficiency and reduce transportation costs.\n\nJunaid Chaudhry, the federal minister for maritime affairs, invited the delegation to visit the country’s coastal areas for a closer look at on-ground opportunities and encouraged their participation in upcoming maritime investment forums.\n\nThe two sides resolved to continue dialogue, conduct feasibility studies, and identify high-impact projects for future collaboration. Both sides expressed optimism that this engagement would lay the foundation for long-term, strategic partnerships across key sectors.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 16th, 2025",
