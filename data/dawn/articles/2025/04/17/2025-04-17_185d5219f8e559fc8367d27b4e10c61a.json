  "content": "PESHAWAR: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Wednesday declared the “forced repatriation” of Afghan nationals from Pakistan a violation of their human rights and urged international community and human rights organisations to take notice of it.\n\n“Pakistani authorities are trampling on the human rights of Afghan refugees by hauling them like chattels in vehicles. Islamabad is unhappy over something else but taking revenge on Afghan refugees. This is a sentimental type of decision,” the JUI-F chief told a news conference here.\n\nMr Fazl said that the issue had also come to the surface in 2017 but categorisation of Afghan nationals was proposed.\n\nHe said that Afghan professionals like doctors, engineers and others should have been adjusted here and should not be forced to leave the country.\n\nSays both countries should sit together to devise repatriation mechanism\n\nThe JUI-F chief said that expulsion of investors and businessmen who were doing business in Pakistan would also have economic consequences.\n\nHe wondered why the country was made to suffer from such “blind decisions”.\n\n“Pakistan’s interest should be kept in mind while making decisions,” he said.\n\nMr Fazl said that students who were enrolled in Pakistan should also not be expelled and as forcing them out leaves them nowhere.\n\nHe said that education was one of the basic human rights and denying it was trampling on human rights.\n\nRegarding the rest of the refugees, the JUI-F chief said that it was an issue between both countries and Pakistan had previously happily accepted Afghan nationals on its soil.\n\nHe said that hospitality was a part of Pashtun code.\n\n“It’s imprudent to kick Afghans out of the country after hosting them for 45 years. Both countries should sit together and devise mechanisms for the repatriation of the Afghans,” he said.\n\nMr Fazl said that unilateral expulsion of Afghan refugees not only violated human rights but also brought bad name to the country.\n\nRegarding the controversial KP Mines and Mineral Bill, 2025, he said that through the proposed legislation, the federal government was trying to take over mineral resources of the country.\n\nHe said that the tempering with the 18th Constitutional Amendment or provincial autonomy was unacceptable.\n\n“The proposed legislation meant to take over the province’s mineral resources is unacceptable and if the government doesn’t back off from it, then they will have to go public. The KP Mines and Mineral Bill not only negates the 18th Constitutional Amendment but also attacks the rights of the province,” he said.\n\nTo a question regarding the JUI-F lawmakers’ support for the Balochistan Mines and Mineral Act, 2025, Mr Fazl said that he had directed the party’s provincial chapter to investigate it and if any member was found errant, the party would take action against him.\n\nHe said that the issue of Cholistan canals as well as minerals bill in KP was creating distances between people and the army.\n\nThe JUI-F chief said that the security situation in the province was precarious, with religious and political leaders being targeted and there was no government writ.\n\nHe said that the situation in the southern districts of KP was particularly bad.\n\n“People are safe neither from the armed groups nor from security forces and are living a distressed life,” he said.\n\nMr Fazl said that JUI-F would arrange the “Israel Murdabad Million March” at Minar Pakistan in Lahore on April 19-20 and in Peshawar on May 11.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
