A strike on another house further north killed three, they said.\n\nMeanwhile, Israel said on Wednesday it would keep blocking humanitarian aid entering Gaza.\n\nIsrael had already halted the entry of aid into Gaza on March 2, exacerbating the severe humanitarian crisis in the war-battered territory.\n\nDefence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue preventing aid from entering the besieged territory of 2.4 million people.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
