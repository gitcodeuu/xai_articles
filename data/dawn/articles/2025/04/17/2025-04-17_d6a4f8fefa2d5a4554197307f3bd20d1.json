He alleged that unidentified individuals in white vehicles disconnected power supply and issued threats of demolishing properties belonging to his family.\n\n“I brought the issue to the PAC today. This is not just an act of intimidation against me — this is an attack on the entire committee and the parliamentary system,” Mr Mastikhel stated. “I have received no notice from Wapda, nor have I committed any illegal act. If my only fault is referring the Dasu Dam case to NAB, I stand by that decision.”\n\nHe added that he is not a defaulter and vowed to continue performing his constitutional duty. “I fear no one but God. This is not about a power meter, it is about the dignity of parliament.”\n\nDuring Tuesday’s meeting, audit officials reported serious irregularities in the redesign of the Karakoram Highway. The cost of the project had risen from Rs4 billion to Rs36 billion. Officials from the Ministry of Water Re­­s­­ources attributed the increase to changes req­uired to align the highway with China-Pak­istan Economic Corridor (CPEC) standards.\n\nPAC Chairman Junaid Akbar strongly condemned the incident and echoed Mr Mastikhel’s concerns, terming the move a direct threat to parliamentary oversight.\n\n“This is not just an attack on the PAC, but an attack on parlia­ment and democracy itself,” Mr Akbar told the media, adding, “The entire committee stands in solidarity with Mastikhel.”\n\nMr Akbar suggested that while the matter may not have direct ties to Fesco, influential individuals or unknown elements were likely behind the move.\n\n“Known people act on the orders of unknown people, but it is the known ones who face the consequences,” he said.\n\nHe also announced that the PAC would summon the Fesco chief and the Secretary for Power to explain the matter. “This is about accountability and transparency. If we can’t ask questions, then the purpose of this committee is defeated,” he said, adding that Parliament must be collectively strengthened.\n\nThe committee unanimously condemned the incident and pledged to continue its oversight work without interference.\n\n“We will not OK the paras and objections raised in the committee,” MNA Naveed Qamar said while suggested that the matter should be taken up with the National Assembly speaker.\n\nMNA Khawaja Sheraz Mehmood called the act “inhumane,” saying such intimidation of parliamentarians was common in Punjab. MNA Saleem Mandviwala termed the incident unacceptable. “Members are doing their jobs and nobody can pressure them,” he said.\n\nMNA Hina Rabbani Khar called the incident “lawlessness,” while Senator Afnanullah Khan said the intimidation of Mastikhel was an attack on all parliamentarians.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
