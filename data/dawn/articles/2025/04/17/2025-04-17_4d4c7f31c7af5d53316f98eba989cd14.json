  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Islamabad United continued their perfect run in the ongoing season of the HBL Pakistan Super League, thrashing Multan Sultans by 47 runs here at the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, thanks to Jason Holder’s impressive all-round show.\n\nThe former West Indies skipper first contributed a cameo of 32 off 14 balls, featuring three fours and two sixes, and then took 4-25 with the ball as Multan were bundled out for 155 in their pursuit of 203.\n\nThe result meant Multan, finalists in the last three seasons, are still in search for their first victory this year. Defending champions Islamabad, meanwhile, with three wins out of three have set up a solid base for their attempt at yet another playoff spot.\n\nUnited were boosted to 202-6 by crucial contributions from Sahibzada Farhan (53 off 35, seven fours and two sixes) and Colin Munro (48 off 25, four fours and three sixes) and cameos from Haider Ali (33 off 16, three fours and two sixes) and Holder down the order.\n\nFarhan carried on his form to help United post 62-1 in the powerplay. He brought up his second consecutive half-century with a four off pacer Mohammad Hasnain, before leg-spinner Usama Mir ended Farhan’s stay at the crease.\n\nMunro got on the act before he was sent packing by by pacer Ubaid Shah with Haider and Holder providing the late impetus.\n\nIn response, Multan got a decent start, posting 62-2 in the powerplay, thanks to Usman Khan’s 31 off 20, and were 93-3 after 10 overs after Holder accounted for Kamran Ghulam. But the big blow came for them when Mohammad Rizwan (38) fell to United counterpart Shadab Khan.\n\nThere wasn’t much more resistance from Multan as they lost their next five wickets for only 35 runs, with Holder taking three of them.\n\nScoreboard\n\nISLAMABAD UNITED:\n\nSahibzada Farhan c Iftikhar b Usama 53\n\nAndries Gous c Usman b Willey 9\n\nColin Munro c Willey b Ubaid 48\n\nShadab Khan c Ubaid b Jordan 14\n\nAzam Khan c Hope b Jordan 4\n\nHaider Ali c Bracewell b Hasnain 33\n\nJason Holder not out 32\n\nNaseem Shah not out 1\n\nEXTRAS (B-4, LB-1, W-3) 8\n\nTOTAL (for six wickets, 20 overs) 202\n\nDID NOT BAT: Mohammad Shahzad, Imad Wasim, Riley Meredith\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-45 (Gous), 2-80 (Farhan), 3-103 (Shadab), 4-128 (Azam), 5-136 (Munro), 6-185 (Haider)\n\nBOWLING: Willey 3-0-21-1, Bracewell 3-0-37-0, Usama 4-0-31-1, Hasnain 2-0-30-1 (1w), Ubaid 4-0-37-1, Jordan 4-0-41-2 (2w)\n\nMULTAN SULTANS:\n\nMohammad Rizwan c Shahzad b Shadab 38\n\nShai Hope c Farhan b Naseem 1\n\nUsman Khan c Meredith b Imad 31\n\nKamran Ghulam c Munro b Holder 17\n\nMichael Bracewell c Holder b Meredith 16\n\nIftikhar Ahmed c Holder b Shahzad 32\n\nDavid Willey c Munro b Holder 1\n\nChris Jordan c Meredith b Imad 5\n\nUsama Mir b Holder 1\n\nMohammad Hasnain b Holder 1\n\nUbaid Shah not out 0\n\nEXTRAS (B-8, NB-3, W-2) 13\n\nTOTAL (all out, 18. 4 overs) 155\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-3 (Hope), 2-62 (Usman), 3-92 (Kamran), 4-96 (Rizwan), 5-120 (Bracewell), 6-124 (Willey), 7-142 (Jordan), 8-150 (Usama), 9-150 (Hasnain)\n\nBOWLING: Naseem 4-0-34-1 (1nb), Meredith 3-0-35-1 (1w), Holder 4-0-25-4 (1w, 2nb), Imad 4-0-33-2, Shadab 3-0-16-1, Shahzad 1-0-1-0\n\nRESULT: Islamabad United won by 47 runs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
