The top seed remained undefeated throughout the tournament and didn’t cede a single set to her opponents.\n\nCompatriot Azan Ali Khan took the Boys U-17 title in similar fashion with a dominating 11-6, 11-4, 11-9 win over local favourite Henry Kross.\n\nKhan is ranked Number 2 in Pakistan in the Boys U-17 category as of March.\n\nTop seed Mahnoor Ali snagged the Girls U-13 title when she thrashed Riyo Kawabata 11-2, 11-5, 11-6 in the final. The 12-year-old, who is currently top ranked in Pakistan, followed in her older sister’s footsteps in remaining undefeated throughout the tournament with three straight wins in each match.\n\nPakistan’s youngest gold medal came from Ahmad Ali Naz when he triumphed over local Freddie Goldsmith 3-1 in the Boys U-11 final. Naz is the number 1 ranked Pakistani in his age group, took the first set 11-5 before Goldsmith took the second set 11-2.\n\nThe second seed had his eye on the prize and blasted Goldsmith in the next two sets 11-6, 11-6 to take home the title.\n\nThe Ali sisters come as a trio, and Sehrish put up a solid fight in her final but it was ultimately Japan’s Emily Senior who triumphed 3-2 in the Girls U15 final.\n\nSenior dominated in the first set with a 15-13 win over Sehrish, who then thrashed the Japanese 11-5 in the second game.\n\nTop seed Senior once again took the score into overdrive as she won the third game 12-10. Sehrish, seeded second, took the fourth game 11-6. Senior took home the title with a resounding 11-4 win over the Pakistani, who came away from the thrilling match with a silver medal.\n\nEarlier this month, Noor Zaman was crowned men’s champion at the U23 World Squash Championship in Karachi 3-2 after a stellar comeback against Egypt’s Karim El Torkey.",
