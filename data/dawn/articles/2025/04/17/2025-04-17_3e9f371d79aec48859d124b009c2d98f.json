The session began with the presentation of the committee’s Annual Report covering the period from June 2024 to March 2025.\n\nMembers of the committee discussed the finalisation of the Private Member’s Bill titled “The Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2025,” introduced by Senator Zeeshan Khanzada during the Senate sitting on Feb 17.\n\nThe discussion, however, focused on objections raised regarding the bill’s classification as a money bill, and members explored the possibility of incorporating changes without designating it as such.\n\nSenator Anusha Rahman countered that the bill does not directly interfere with taxation. “If a proposal leads to improvement, we should consider it rather than block it,” she added.\n\nTo seek further clarity, the committee unanimously decided to summon FBR Chairman Rashid Langrial for the next meeting before finalising the bill.\n\nSecretary Cabinet Division Kamran Ali Afzal briefed the committee on the government’s right-sizing initiative. He informed the committee that the prime minister had instructed a reduction in the size of the federal government to improve efficiency and prioritise core responsibilities and added that institutional reforms had also been initiated as part of this directive.\n\nHe also said that the premier had ordered a review of government-run commercial activities to assess their necessity and effectiveness.\n\nThe cabinet secretary clarified that the right-sizing process would not impact regulatory authorities. However, these bodies are asked to submit data on consultants, staff strength, and salary structures. The effects of right-sizing on autonomous institutions are also being examined.\n\nSenator Sherry Rehman expressed concern over the government’s approach to reforms. “On one hand, the government talks about cutting costs, yet on the other, it has doubled the size of the federal cabinet,” she stated.\n\nShe also raised concerns that the right-sizing policy could cause significant hardship for government employees. “What will be the impact on those who are forced into early retirement?” she asked.\n\nThe meeting underscored the complexities of balancing fiscal discipline with administrative effectiveness and the challenges in executing large-scale structural reforms. The chairman of the committee and its members unanimously decided to review the matter thoroughly and department-wise and to discuss it further in the next meeting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
