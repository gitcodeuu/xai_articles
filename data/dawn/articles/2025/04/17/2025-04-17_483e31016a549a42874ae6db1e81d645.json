He must be stopped.”\n\nThe case is the latest of more than a dozen lawsuits that California has filed against the Trump administration.\n\nA White House spokesman quoted by local media dismissed the lawsuit.\n\n“Instead of focusing on California’s rampant crime, homelessness, and unaffordability, Gavin Newsom is spending his time trying to block President Trump’s historic efforts to finally address the national emergency of our country’s persistent goods trade deficits,” the spokesman said.",
