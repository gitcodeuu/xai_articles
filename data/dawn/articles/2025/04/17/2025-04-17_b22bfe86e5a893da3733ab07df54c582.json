He has never been convicted of any crime and had been granted a protected status that should have barred his deportation to El Salvador.\n\nA federal judge, backed by the Supreme Court, has ordered Abrego Garcia’s return, but the Trump administration contends he is now solely in Salvadoran custody.\n\nBukele, who has proudly adopted the moniker of “world’s coolest dictator”, has said he does not have the power to send the man back.\n\nHoping to heap political pressure on the Trump administration, Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen visited El Salvador on Wednesday to plead the case of Abrego Garcia, who he said was illegally abducted from the United States. Van Hollen met Vice President Felix Ulloa, who denied him all access to the man.\n\n“His answer was that the Trump administration is paying El Salvador, the government of El Salvador, to keep him at Cecot,” the senator said of the response he got from Ulloa.\n\nWashington and San Salvador have shrugged off criticism of their collaboration, and Trump on Monday warmly thanked Bukele for “helping us out” with his administration’s mass deportation drive.\n\nEl Salvador is receiving $6 million to house the migrants, and Bukele left Monday’s meeting with an agreement for his country to join the US Global Entry programme, which allows expedited visa entry.\n\nAFP interviewed several relatives of Venezuelans detained in El Salvador, all of whom insisted their loved ones were not criminals.\n\nAlexis de Hernandez, mother of 31-year-old Andry Hernandez Romero, said her son was rounded up “just for having tattoos”— a common complaint in this drama.\n\nUS officials have claimed the markings indicate loyalty to Venezuela’s Tren de Aragua gang, but experts note that the group — unlike Salvadoran gangs —does not use tattoos for clan identification.\n\nAccording to Cristosal, nearly half of the Cecot detainees it has been able to trace had asylum status in the United States or were applying for asylum, “which should protect them from deportation.”\n\nTrump has encouraged Bukele to build more jails and said Tuesday he would “love” to start also sending American citizens who commit violent crimes to the Cecot.\n\nThe Washington-based Wola advocacy group warned in a commentary published on Monday that “thousands of citizens are languishing in El Salvador’s abusive prison system” and “at least 350 people have died in custody as a result of these conditions”.\n\n“Corruption and lack of transparency [in El Salvador] should be of bipartisan concern” for the United States, it argued.\n\n“The US must not only monitor how its financial assistance is being used, but also examine whether it is inadvertently supporting a government that systematically withholds information and evades accountability.”\n\nHeader image: Salvadoran police officers escort alleged members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and the MS-13 gang recently deported by the US government to be imprisoned in the Terrorism Confinement Centre (Cecot) prison, as part of an agreement with the Salvadoran government, in San Luis Talpa, El Salvador, in this handout image obtained on March 31, 2025. — Secretaria de Prensa de la Presidencia/Handout — Reuters",
