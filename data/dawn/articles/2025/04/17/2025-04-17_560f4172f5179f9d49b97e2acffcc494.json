  "content": "PESHAWAR: Awami National Party on Wednesday announced to hold a multiparty conference on April 23 to press the provincial government to withdraw the proposed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Mineral Act, 2025.\n\nThe decision was taken at meeting of the party’s cabinet held at the Bacha Khan Markaz here with provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain in the chair.\n\nANP senior vice-president Syed Aqil Shah, general secretary Hussain Shah Yousafzai, provincial spokesperson Arsalan Khan Nazim and other members of the cabinet attended the meeting.\n\nAccording to a statement, the MPC would be held at the Bacha Khan Markaz, wherein representatives of different political parties and civil society organisations would share their views on the proposed legislation.\n\nIftikhar says draft legislation ‘attack’ on provincial autonomy\n\nBefore the MPC, a special meeting of all district presidents and secretaries will be held on April 21 to decide the course of action on the proposed bill at the district level.\n\nReiterating his party’s stance, Iftikhar Hussain said the draft legislation was against the provincial autonomy. “The bill presented in the assembly is a conspiracy to roll back the 18th Constitutional Amendment.”\n\n“ANP will never allow this conspiracy to succeed. The powerful forces should refrain from imposing unconstitutional decisions on the provinces for their own interests. We have neither accepted such oppressive decisions before nor will we accept them now. Those involved in such unconstitutional measures are criminals of this nation and land. We should not be forced to take more difficult decisions for our rights,” he warned.\n\nIftikhar said the approval of 18th Constitutional Amendment was the result of a long struggle. “It was struggle of our leaders that made it possible to achieve provincial autonomy,” he asserted.\n\nMian Iftikhar said the people of all nationalities living in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were the heirs of this land. “Together, they would not only protect their rights but would also ensure their achievement.”\n\nHe expressed the hope that all patriotic and democratic people who believed in provincial autonomy and the right and authority over their resources would support us in this struggle.\n\nThe meeting offered Fateha for the departed soul of former ANP deputy general secretary Mutawakil Khan Advocate.\n\nHis son, Sikandar Shahzad Advocate was nominated as deputy general secretary, which was unanimously approved by the cabinet.\n\nProvincial secretary for culture Akbar Hoti Advocate was nominated as the provincial coordinator of ANP Writers’ Association.\n\nVarious administrative committees were also formed for making the MPC a success.\n\nA committee led by Mian Iftikhar was tasked with liaising with other political parties for the conference.\n\nA committee led by provincial joint secretary Matiullah Marwat was to liaise with various chambers, associations and the business community for the MPC.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
