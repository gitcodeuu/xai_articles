Therefore, no fresh oath was required, the government said, adding that oath of all high courts, including IHC, was identical.\n\nThe transferred judges having already taken oath could not be required to take any other oath, which even otherwise was not provided by the Constitution, the government argued.\n\nArticle 200\n\nIt also explained that Article 200 was a code unto itself, laying out the structure of exercise of power to transfer high court judges.\n\nArticle 200(1) deals with the power of the president to transfer judges from one high court to another thereby attributing a clear permanence to the transfer. A lack of the term “for such period” or “during the period’ in Article 200(1) clearly reflects that the transfer is not in the nature of a temporary arrangement, the government added.\n\nPermanency of transfer under Article 200(1) is also evident from the fact that to send the transferee judge back to his parent high court, the president will have to follow the entire procedure provided under Article 200(1) again.\n\nThe chief justice of a particular high court identifies the need to increase judges’ strength in that court, the government argued.\n\nBesides, it added, Section 3 of the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010 provides that the IHC shall consist of CJ and 12 other judges to be appointed from the provinces and other territories of Pakistan, in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nKeeping in line with the mandate of the said section and the sanctioned strength of IHC, on a summary initiated by the law ministry, the prime minister advised the president to authorise the law ministry to initiate process under Article 200(1).\n\nJCP meeting today\n\nMeanwhile, the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) has rescheduled its meeting from April 18 to April 17 to consider nomination of two more judges to SC’s constitutional bench.\n\nThe meeting, which has been rescheduled in view of the official engagements of some JCP members, will now held today at 3pm at the SC building.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, CJP Yahya Afridi administered the oath of office to Justice Ali Baqar Najafi, who was elevated to the apex court from the Lahore High Court by the JCP a few days ago.\n\nRegistrar Mohammad Salim Khan conducted the proceedings. SC judges, Attorney General for Pakistan, senior lawyers, officers of the federal judicial academy, law officers and officers of the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan attended the ceremony.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
