He said: “We are ready to receive the bodies at the border, though it is too late for bodies to reach at the Pak-Iran border.”\n\nThere are reports that the bodies, after being handed over to the Pak­istani authorities, might be airlifted to Bahawalpur directly from Zahidan.\n\nIranian foreign minister assures Pakistan the culprits will be brought to book\n\nThe victims, all from Punjab, were killed on April 12 when gunmen stormed a car repair shop in Mehrestan, a city in Iran’s Sistan-Baluchestan province, near the Pakis­tan border. Local sources said the attackers tied the workers’ hands and feet before shooting them.\n\nOn Wednesday, the For­eign Office (FO) in a statement said: “Foreign Mini­ster Araghchi, while offering condolences on the tragic death of eight Pak­is­tanis in Iran, assured full cooperation in bringing the perpetrators to justice and repatriating the mortal remains of the victims.”\n\nThe FO had earlier called on the Iranian auth­orities to conduct a thorough investigation. “We hope for Iranian side’s full cooperation in investigating the matter and in timely repatriation of victims’ remains,” it said.\n\nSistan-Baluchestan, like Pakistan’s adjacent Balochistan province, is restive, mineral-rich, and underdeveloped, and has seen a surge in attacks by separatist groups in recent years.\n\nThe two foreign ministers also discussed the recently held indirect talks between US and Iran in Oman. Mr Dar “appreciated and encouraged” the dialogue, the FO added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
