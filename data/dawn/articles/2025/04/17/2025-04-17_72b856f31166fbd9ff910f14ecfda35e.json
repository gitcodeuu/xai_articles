Sardar Akhtar Mengal has the right to protest, but we will decide the venue of the protest.”\n\nThe BNP-M staged a sit-in for 20 days against the arrest of Baloch activists, and now decided to launch a public outreach movement instead.\n\nMr Bugti lashed out at the Balochistan Yakjehti Committee (BYC), terming its activists “abettors” of separatists.\n\nResponding to a query, he said: “They call themselves human rights activists, but BYC is not registered anywhere. They burn Pakistan’s flag wherever they pass through. They are not peaceful; they are abettors of separatists and terrorists.”\n\nOn the case against Mahrang Baloch over her Quetta protest, for which the Balochistan High Court told her lawyers to approach the provincial government, Mr Bugti said the courts would decide.\n\nHe said Balochistan’s people had political rights, highlighting that various politicians from the province had been part of the parliament for many years.\n\nThe chief minister expressed gratitude to the federal government for allocating funds for the dualisation of a main highway in Balochistan (N-25) and the Kachhi Canal Project. “This financial support is a goodwill gesture for the people of Balochistan, as the money comes from the national exchequer and belongs to every Pakistani,” he added.\n\nMr Bugti noted that the dualisation of the N-25 highway — linking Chaman, Quetta, Kalat, Khuzdar and Karachi — will significantly improve transportation and provide a safe, international-standard road to the public.\n\nHighlighting the importance of the Kachhi Canal project, he said its completion would mark the beginning of an agricultural revolution in the province by ensuring irrigation for vast farmland areas.\n\n‘Security top priority’\n\nResponding to a question, the chief minister said that improving the security situation in Balochistan remains the top priority.\n\nHe acknowledged the challenge but affirmed the government’s resolve and capacity to tackle it, stating, “Pakistan’s prosperity begins from Balochistan.”\n\nTo another question, Mr Bugti said public sector development expenditure in Balochistan had been enhanced to benefit the people of the province directly.\n\nHe also highlighted the Rs70 billion solarisation of tube wells in Balochistan — a joint initiative of the federal and provincial governments — as a shining example of this collaboration, with the federal government covering 70 per cent of the cost.\n\nDuring the press conference, Khalid Magsi described CM Bugti’s approach to the talks with BNP-M as “very good”.\n\nJamal Kamal said mistakes had also been committed by those now holding protests in Balochistan. He said Balochistan has abundant natural resources, but attempts were being made to deprive the province of benefiting from them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
