  "content": "KARACHI: Kuwait extended an oil credit facility to Pakistan for an additional two years, Pakistan’s petroleum ministry said on Wednesday, which will help Islamabad manage energy imports while maintaining its foreign exchange reserves.\n\nThe extension marked the first time Kuwait has prolonged the credit facility for two years. It typically grants Pakistan one-year extensions.\n\nPakistan says its economy has stabilised under a $7 billion International Monetary Fund bailout that helped stave off a default threat.\n\nBut with energy imports representing a major drain on foreign exchange, the government relies on credit facilities and rollovers to maintain reserve levels.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 17th, 2025",
