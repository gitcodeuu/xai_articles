We will not allow public transporters to exploit passengers by charging extra fares under the pretext of a transport shortage,” said DSP Khan.\n\nThe police have also issued a strict warning against celebratory firing on Chand Raat, warning the violators will face severe legal action.\n\n“Anyone found challenging the writ of the law by engaging in festive firing on Chand Raat will be arrested and prosecuted under strict legal provisions,” a statement issued by the police said.\n\nAWARENESS SESSION: The Election Commission of Pakistan has urged young people and women to exercise their right to vote and candidacy to bring significant change in their lives, particularly in the formerly tribal district of Torghar.\n\n“You and local women voters can transform the social fabric by exercising their right to vote and candidacy,” district election commissioner Fareedullah Khan Khattak told an awareness session held in Hassanzai area of Torghar on Sunday.\n\nYoung people from different parts of the district attended the session and inquired about the process for registration of their and their families’ votes.\n\nM Khattak said the election commission had launched an awareness campaign in the district to educate voters.\n\n“We aim to increase the participation of women and young voters in the electoral process, and this could only be possible if you turn out at polling stations,” he said.\n\nThe district election commissioner said that Torghar was among the districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with a low women voter turnout.\n\nHe said young people were being encouraged to mobilise voters in their respective village councils and communities.\n\nThe district election commissioner urged young individuals, who recently turned 18, to visit his office for registration as voters.\n\n“Young people should also ensure that every eligible family member is registered with the election commission,” Mr Khattak added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
