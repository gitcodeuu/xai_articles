President Zardari is an icon of national unity, his resilience continues to inspire us all,” she wrote.\n\nWhen reached out for a comment, a source close to the party had told Dawn.com that he was “undergoing some tests and would be discharged soon”.\n\nA statement from the office of Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori said he called the president’s physician and asked about Zardari’s health while expressing his well wishes.\n\nAt 69 years of age, President Zardari has had multiple health issues in recent years.\n\nHe tested positive for Covid-19 in July 2022 but only experienced “mild symptoms”, according to his son and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.\n\nThe president had fractured his foot while deboarding an aeroplane in October 2024. Following the fall, he was immediately taken to a hospital for treatment. After a check-up, the doctor placed his foot in a cast.\n\nIn March 2023, he underwent an eye surgery in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nIn 2022, Zardari was admitted to Karachi’s Dr Ziauddin Hospital for one week for treatment of a chest infection. Amid rumours of ill health, his personal physician and close aide Dr Asim had confirmed that he was “in good health”.\n\nA year prior to that, Zardari was admitted to a private hospital in Karachi due to “exertion and exhaustion” caused by his frequent travelling.",
