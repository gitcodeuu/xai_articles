Its presence in Pakistan highlights the ecological richness of the Sulaiman Mountains, which serve as a refuge for many endangered species.\n\nEnvironmentalists urge the government and local communities to strengthen conservation measures in the region. “This sighting should prompt stricter anti-poaching laws and habitat preservation efforts, Leghari emphasised.\n\nFor now, authorities are monitoring the area discreetly, hoping to gather more data without drawing unwanted attention. The discovery serves as a reminder of Pakistan’s diverse - yet fragile - wildlife heritage, demanding urgent protection before more species slip into extinction.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
