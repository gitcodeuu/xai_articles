  "content": "RAHIM YAR KHAN: A massive fire reduced thousands of Eucalyptus and other trees to ashes, damaging wildlife across 40 acres of the Bakhuwala forest in Abbasia Plantation Range, located between Abbasia Canal and Abbasia Link Canal in Liaquatpur tehsil on Tuesday noon.\n\nAccording to reports, the fire started around 1pm in a strip of the forest along the Abbasia Canal. Initially affecting about 23 acres, it later spread to nearly 40 acres due to strong winds and dry conditions.\n\nLocal residents claimed that no forest staff or rescue teams were present at the site as officials were on Eid holidays. After several hours, firefighters and forest staff arrived but struggled to bring the blaze under control.\n\nThe Abbasia Plantation Range, stretching from Channi Goth to Head Qasimwala near Feroza town in Liaqatpur tehsil, had a variety of trees that suffered extensive damage in the fire.\n\nAccording to initial reports, the fire was allegedly caused by a cigarette in a nearby passage, which ignited dry bushes and quickly spread across the forest. The blaze covered around 10 km along the Abbasia Canal and advanced toward the Qasimwala Forest Range.\n\nDistrict Forest Officer (DFO) Azeem Zafar said the fire was finally brought under control by 2am on Wednesday, with cooling operations still underway. He added that a passage between the canal and the forest helped contain the fire, preventing major losses in the main forest area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
