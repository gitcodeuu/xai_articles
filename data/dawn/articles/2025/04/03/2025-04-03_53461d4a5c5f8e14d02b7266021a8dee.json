  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The legal team of former prime minister Imran Khan intends to file contempt of court petition against the Superintendent of Adiala Jail for not complying with the direction of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on jail’s visitation including during the Eid holidays.\n\nOn March 24th, a larger bench of the IHC comprising acting chief justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Arbab Mohammad Tahir, and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan reinstated Imran Khan’s visitation rights, allowing him to receive visitors twice a week.\n\nThe larger bench also disposed of all 26 petitions related to visitation rights and prison conditions. These petitions, including contempt of court applications against Adiala Jail Superintendent Abdul Ghafoor Anjum, were transferred to the larger bench at the request of the jail authorities, citing logistical challenges in appearing before multiple benches.\n\nDuring the Eid holidays, the prison administration allowed Azam Khan Swati, Nadia Khattak, Ansar Kayani, and Tabish Farooq to meet Imran Khan. However, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja, who was designated as the coordinator to share visitor names with the prison authorities, was denied visitation. He submitted the names of Niazullah Niazi, Shoaib Shaheen, Ali Bukhari, Faisal Malik, Naeem Panjutha, and himself for the meeting on the second day of Eidul Fitr. Since Mr Panjutha failed to arrive at the prison, his name was replaced with Azam Khan Swati.\n\nSpokesman alleges authorities did not allow PTI founder’s meeting with his sisters; jail officials claim none of his family members came to prison on first day of Eid\n\nThe prison authorities permitted Mr Swati, Ms Khattak, Mr Kayani, and Mr Farooq to visit Mr Khan.\n\nNiazullah Niazi, spokesman for Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi, deemed this a violation of the larger bench’s decision.\n\nTalking to Dawn, Mr Niazi said that the legal team would file a contempt of court petition on three counts. According to him, the jail authorities allowed four visitors on March 25, contrary to the agreed-upon six. On March 27, the administration denied visits from Allama Nasir Abbas, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Junaid Akbar Khan, and Azam Khan Swati. On April 1, they were denied again.\n\nIt may be mentioned that Salman Akram Raja has also forwarded the names of Omar Ayub, Shibli Faraz, Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Zartajgul Wazir and Aliya Hamza for a meeting on April 3 (today).\n\nMr Niazi said that the jail authorities did not allow Mr Khan’s meeting with his sisters on the first day of Eid.\n\nAccording to the jail sources, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur visited Mr Khan on April 2 and remained with him for a couple of hours. However, none of Mr Khan’s family members visited the prison on the first day of Eid, the jail authorities claimed.\n\nThey said that on the second day, permission was granted on a first come, first served basis and those who did not come on time were not allowed the meeting.\n\nDuring the hearing before the larger bench, Advocate Naveed Malik representing the jail superintendent argued that the meetings were being held twice a week until December, prior to Imran Khan’s and Bushra Bibi’s conviction in January.\n\n“According to the jail rules, the superintendent of Adiala Jail has the authority [to schedule the meetings accordingly],” he added.\n\nLawyer Naveed Malik alleged that the PTI leaders misused the privilege of the meetings and started making political speeches outside Adiala jail. “After meetings, they come outside the jail and make political statements — this is a violation,” he said.\n\nThe larger bench, however, allowed the meetings with Mr Khan twice a week, with a condition that the visitors would not give political statements outside the jail premises.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
