He pretended to be ill to flee the scene.”\n\nThe first information report (FIR) was registered at the Sundar Police Station in Lahore under Section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code on the mother’s complaint.\n\nThe FIR said her daughter was shot dead in the early hours of Thursday morning.\n\n“After the mehndi, we had many guests staying over at our home,” she said in the FIR.\n\n“At 5:30am on Thursday, we suddenly heard gunfire. My other daughter, brother-in-law and I saw [the suspect] running from the room with a gun in his hand. My daughter (the victim) was lying on the bed in a pool of her own blood, with blood flowing from her head,” she added.\n\nViolence against women remains commonplace in Pakistan. Last month, police arrested a woman for allegedly killing her husband’s second wife and dumping the body in a quarter adjacent to her house in the Liaquatabad area of Lahore.\n\nGlobally, 85,000 women and girls were killed intentionally in 2023, according to a report on femicides released in November last year.\n\nThe report, ’Femicides in 2023: Global Estimates of Intimate Partner/Family Member Femicides — jointly produced by UN Women and UN Office for Drug and Crime — was released to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women.\n\nAccording to the report, a vast majority of intentional killings of women and girls worldwide are perpetrated by intimate partners or other family members.",
