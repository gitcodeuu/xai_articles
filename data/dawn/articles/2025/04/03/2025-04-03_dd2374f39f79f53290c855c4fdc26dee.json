The previous rate was Rs250. Likewise, for articulated trucks the toll has been revised to Rs550 from Rs500.\n\nMotorway tolls have also been increased across major routes, including M1, M3, M4, M5, M14, and E35. The M1 Islamabad-Peshawar Mot­­o­rway car toll was raised to Rs550, while the M3 Lahore-Abdul Hak­eem Motorway fee has jum­ped from Rs700 to Rs800.\n\nUnder the revised tolls on Islamabad-Peshawar Motorway for wagon or 12-seater, it has been fixed as Rs850, for 13-15 seaters/coaster/minibus is Rs1150, bus Rs1,650, 2 & 3 axle trucks Rs2,150 and Rs2,650 for articulated trucks.\n\nThe toll for a car on the M4 Pindi Bhattian-Faisa­labad-Multan Moto­rway has been increased from Rs950 to Rs1,050, and the M5 Multan-Sukkur Motorway to Rs1,200 from Rs1,100.
