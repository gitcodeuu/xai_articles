Visuals shared on social media showed his funeral prayers were offered and he was laid to rest with full military honours in his village on Wednesday.\n\nTuesday’s casualties coincided with an exchange of fire between Pakistani and Indian troops in the same area, marking the first ceasefire violation of 2025.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Hajira Waleed Anwar told Dawn that Indian troops resorted to unprovoked firing from across the LoC at around 2pm with small arms, catching residents on the Pakistani side off-guard.\n\n“People were celebrating the second day of Eid, with some picnicking along the banks of River Poonch, when suddenly, firing started from across the divide,” he said.\n\nHe said that Pakistani troops responded and the exchange of fire ended by 3pm.\n\nMilitary sources confirmed that the Pakistan army swiftly responded to India’s small arms fire following the accidental explosion.\n\nWhile the ISPR statement did not mention the exchange of fire, it reaffirmed the army’s capability to counter any threat and respond to aggression with full preparedness.\n\n“Pakistan Army possesses the full capability to effectively fulfill its professional responsibilities in any emergency situation and remains fully prepared to deliver a resolute response to any aggression,” the ISPR said.\n\nIn February 2021, the armies of both countries had issued a rare joint statement reaffirming their commitment to upholding the ceasefire along the disputed border in Kashmir, an agreement they had originally signed in November 2003.\n\nBarring some sporadic ceasefire violations by Indian troops, the truce has largely held after the renewed commitment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
