Now, phase 2 will begin from [Thursday] and we have established camps, one each at Landi Kotal and Nasir Bagh Road,” a senior official from Afghan Commi­ssionerate in Peshawar told Dawn.\n\nThe two-day relaxation for Eid led to some confusion among official circles, with some sources suggesting that the deadline for repatriation had been extended.\n\nThe AFP news agency reported the deadline has been extended until the beginning of next week due to Eid holidays, while the Associated Press claimed that arrests and deportations had been paused until April 10.\n\nLaw enforcement sources in the twin cities also claimed that the deadline for Afghans’ repatriation had been quietly extended to April 10, and nothing was conveyed officially.\n\nBut an interior ministry official denied this claim, maintaining that there had been no extension.\n\nUNHCR concerns\n\nAccording to official statistics, a total of 69,494 families — including 473,397 individuals, of which 157,513 were men, 111,381 were women and 197,821 children — have been sent back to Afghanistan since September 2023.\n\nUNHCR spokesperson Qaiser Khan Afridi told Dawn the UN agency was concerned regarding the government’s directive, as among the Afghan Citizen Cardholders, there might be individuals requiring international protection.\n\n“In that light, we are urging the government [view] their situation through a humanitarian lens. We also call for engagement between Pakistan and Afghanistan so that the returns can be dignified and voluntary,” Mr Afridi told Dawn.\n\nMeanwhile, Afghan Mini­ster for Refugees and Reparation Mawlavi Abdul Kabir called for the humane treatment for refugees, especially in light of reports of mistreatment of Afghans by border nations, including instances where individuals holding legal visas were also deported.\n\nIn a statement, the interim Afghan government also reiterated its call for the voluntary return of Afghan migrants and urged Pakistan and Iran to stop forced deportations.\n\nMohammad Asghar in Rawalpindi and Iftikhar A. Khan in Islamabad also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
