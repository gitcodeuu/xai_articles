We didn’t venture out after Maghrib due to excessive firing,” Sultan Akbar, a local, said.\n\nHe said that he thought the police would visit the area in the morning if not possible on the same [Sunday] night, but nothing happened.\n\nWhen contacted, police officials said that the cases of festive firing would be thoroughly investigated and action taken.\n\n“There were clear instructions issued by the senior officials and the festive firing will not be tolerated. We will thoroughly investigate all the cases, identify those involved and lodge cases against them,” Peshawar’s SSP operations Masood Bangash said.\n\nMeanwhile, two persons, including an Afghan national, were arrested after they opened fire at personnel of the Ababeel Squad of the city police in the jurisdiction of Faqeerabad police station on Tuesday, officials said.\n\nThey added two ‘intoxicated’ persons opened fire from a car.\n\n“The police chased the car and arrested two persons, including an Afghan national,” SP Faqeerabad division Talal told mediapersons.\n\nA statement issued from the city police said the Ababeel Squad personnel were on duty when they came under fire near Bacha Khan Chowk.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
