The next day, BYC activists attempted to exhume bodies from a graveyard after burial, which triggered protests and led to the blockade of Sariab Road and other areas for over 12 hours, he added.\n\nThe spokesperson reiterated that while the government respects the right to protest, the location and manner of demonstrations must be determined by district authorities — something the BYC has consistently refused to acknowledge.\n\nDIG Goraya detailed the events following the Jaffar Express attack, claiming that five bodies were brought to the Civil Hospital on March 14. When Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited Quetta on March 19, BYC members arrived at the hospital to claim the bodies, but were asked to call the legal heirs.\n\nMr Goraya questioned who could legally claim the bodies of members of the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). He claimed that the protesters attempted to forcibly remove the bodies, damaging hospital property in the process.\n\nHe said that the BYC’s so-called peaceful protest resulted in significant damage to public property, including the destruction of 36 CCTV cameras, 18 utility poles, the main gate of Balochistan University and the burning of a post office. Additionally, an attempt was made to loot a bank.\n\nIn response, police were compelled to use tear gas. During the turmoil, the BYC placed three bodies on Sariab Road and alleged that police firing had killed them. Mr Goraya dismissed the claim, questioning why random bystanders would be hit if the police had actually opened fire.\n\nFamilies of the deceased reportedly sought the return of their loved ones’ bodies and distanced themselves from the BYC, but protesters allegedly pressured them into continuing the demonstration. Some even surrounded the victims’ homes in an attempt to force their participation.\n\nMr Goraya further stated that a total of 61 individuals were arrested under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO) Act, with 13 placed under judicial remand. However, 35 minors detained during the protests were released after their parents provided assurances. He also highlighted that past BYC demonstrations have led to the burning of 13 police vehicles and injuries to officers.\n\nOn the political front, Mr Rind confirmed that the BNP’s long march from Wadh to Quetta had been restricted due to security concerns, and the party was invited to an in-camera session to discuss the law and order situation.\n\nHe added that internet services were suspended due to security threats and that the authorities are investigating the Mastung attack, which, if successful, could have had severe consequences for Pakistan.\n\nAddressing concerns about banning the BYC, Mr Rind stated that he was unaware of any such decision, emphasising that the courts are available to provide legal relief where necessary. The government, he assured, remains open to dialogue but will not allow the destruction of public property in the name of protests.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
