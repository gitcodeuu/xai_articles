He added that Uraan Pakistan will connect the country’s economy with cutting-edge technology.\n\nAhsan Iqbal stressed the importance of unity, solidarity and harmony within the nation for national development.\n\nHe lamented that some politicians had tarnished the country’s image by portraying Pakistanis as thieves and robbers for personal gain, in contrast to the true identity of the nation – hardworking and intelligent people. “We must prove the strength of the Pakistani brand to the world through hard work, intelligence, honesty, and high quality,” he said.\n\nHe further explained that Pakistan’s struggles stemmed from political uncertainty, a lack of policy continuity and instability.\n\nThe minister pointed out that Pakistan was blessed with minerals worth trillions of dollars, and the government has already initiated several projects in Balochistan to transform it into the most developed and prosperous province.\n\nBesides, he said, the government has launched a programme to train 200,000 youth annually in IT, and 1,000 agricultural experts were being sent to China for training in modern farming systems.“We are determined to make Pakistan a trillion-dollar economy by 2035. Pakistan is our identity and homeland, and we will not allow any harm to it,” he affirmed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
