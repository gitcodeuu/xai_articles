  "content": "Termination notices sent by billionaire Elon Musk’s cost-cutting team to US Agency for International Development (USAID) staff were so rife with errors that corrected versions are being issued to avoid affecting pensions and pay, according to five sources familiar with the issue.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) “did this so quickly that they screwed lots of stuff up”, said a US official, who requested anonymity, as did all of those who spoke to Reuters.\n\nThe State Department, which is assuming some of USAID’s functions under the Trump administration’s plan to cut US foreign aid, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nUSAID’s human resources staff, most of whom have been on paid administrative leave and face termination, have been brought back to the office to send out accurate notices, said the US official and a person familiar with the matter.\n\n“My letter was completely wrong,” one USAID worker told Reuters on condition of anonymity. “The only thing correct was my name.”\n\nIt is not the first time that inaccurate termination notices have upended the lives of USAID workers since US President Donald Trump and Musk began in February to dismember America’s main conduit of foreign aid.\n\nA first-round set April 21 as the final employment day for most personnel and May 30 for those tapped to help shutter the agency. Those dates were reset to July 1 or September 2 in the notices sent to some 3,500 USAID workers last Friday, two sources and workers said.\n\nOther errors included inaccurate start dates, lengths of service and salaries, according to the person familiar with the matter, the US official, two former senior USAID officials, a congressional aide and four workers who received notices.\n\nUnless fixed, those mistakes could result in reduced or cancelled pensions or inaccurate severance pay, the sources said.\n\nSeveral of the sources pointed to the US Office of Personnel Management’s retirement website which says federal workers’ annual pension annuity is based on their lengths of service and three highest average annual salaries.\n\nReuters could not learn how many USAID personnel were issued faulty notices last Friday.\n\nSeveral workers told Reuters that they and other colleagues received a third termination letter on Monday night still containing inaccurate information on promotions, tenure and other data.\n\nOne worker said the total federal service listed in their notice on Friday was short by three years and by six years in the notice they received on Monday.\n\n“I actually have federal service dating to June 2008,” said the worker. “There doesn’t seem to be any logic to the RIF (reduction in force) process.”\n\n“We’ve got people who have served for 25 years and their notices are showing they served for only three,” said the US official. “It affects their severance. It affects their future ability to retire.”\n\nTrump assigned Musk, a major contributor to his 2024 election campaign whose companies have federal contracts worth billions of dollars, and DOGE to ferret out waste and fraud across the US government.\n\nAccording to its website, the only official window into its operations, DOGE estimates it has saved US taxpayers $140 billion as of April 2 through a series of actions, including massive workforce cuts, asset sales, and contract cancellations.\n\nIts savings total is unverifiable and its calculations have contained errors and corrections. Musk has said DOGE will correct mistakes when it finds them.\n\nSince February, most USAID staff have been put on administrative leave, hundreds of contractors have been fired and more than 5,000 programmes terminated, disrupting global humanitarian aid operations on which millions depend.\n\nSome termination notices sent on Friday to USAID personnel did not account for requests to waive the July 1 termination date, including from overseas staff whose children still would be in school, according to three sources.\n\nOthers had applied for waivers because they needed more time to pack their homes and relocate to the US, the sources said.\n\n“Some people have the wrong dates. Others have the wrong information,” said the person with knowledge of the matter, adding that people given the wrong termination date “can’t return home” unless their notices are reissued with the correct date.\n\nThe person said that the error-filled notices were sent under the supervision of USAID acting administrators Jeremy Lewin, a DOGE operative, and Kenneth Jackson, who have been overseeing the agency’s dismantlement.\n\nThey report to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who Trump tapped as acting USAID administrator.\n\nMusk will remain a friend and adviser to President Trump and Vice President JD Vance, even after he leaves his role with DOGE, Vance said in an interview with Fox News on Thursday.\n\nPolitico and ABC reported on Wednesday that Trump had told members of his Cabinet that Musk will soon depart and return to the private sector, although it was not clear if Musk would leave before his 130-day mandate as a special government employee expires around late May.\n\n“DOGE has got a lot of work to do, and yeah, that work is going to continue after Elon leaves. But fundamentally, Elon is going to remain a friend and an adviser of both me and the president,” he said.",
