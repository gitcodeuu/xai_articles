It separately confirmed to AFP the building housed a UN clinic.\n\nThe Palestinian foreign ministry, based in the occupied West Bank, condemned the “massacre” at the clinic run by UNRWA, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, and called for “serious international pressure” to halt Israel’s widening offensive.\n\nIsrael has on several occasions conducted strikes on UNRWA buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for most of the past 18 months.\n\nIsrael also carried out deadly air strikes in southern and central Gaza on Wednesday. The civil defence said dawn strikes killed at least 13 people in Khan Yunis and two in Nuseirat refugee camp.\n\n‘Horrified’\n\nIn February, Katz announced plans for an agency to oversee the “voluntary departure” of Palestinians from the territory.\n\nThat followed Israel’s backing of a proposal from US President Donald Trump for the United States to take over the territory after relocating its 2.4 million Palestinian inhabitants. The proposal outraged Gazans and drew widespread international condemnation.\n\nIsrael resumed intense bombing of Gaza on March 18 before launching a new ground offensive, ending a nearly two-month ceasefire.\n\nAn Israeli group representing the families of prisoners still held in Gaza said they were “horrified” by Katz’s announcement of expanded military operations.\n\n“Has it been decided to sacrifice the hostages for the sake of ‘territorial gains?’” the Hostages and Missing Families Forum asked in a statement.\n\nAt least 1,066 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel resumed military operations, the health ministry in the Hamas-run territory said.\n\nThat took the overall toll to at least 50,423 since the war began in October 2023.\n\n‘They’re all closed’\n\nHunger loomed in Gaza City as bakeries closed due to worsening shortages of flour and sugar since Israel blocked the entry of supplies from March 2.\n\n“I’ve been going from bakery to bakery all morning, but none of them are operating, they’re all closed,” Amina al-Sayed told AFP.\n\nOn Sunday, Netanyahu offered to let Hamas leaders leave Gaza but demanded the group abandon its arms.\n\nHamas has signalled willingness to cede power in Gaza but calls disarmament a “red line”.\n\nEgypt, Qatar and the United States are attempting to broker a new ceasefire and secure the release of the remaining Israeli prisoners.\n\nA senior Hamas official said on Saturday the group had approved a new ceasefire proposal, while Netanyahu’s office said Israel had submitted a counteroffer. The details remain undisclosed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 3rd, 2025",
