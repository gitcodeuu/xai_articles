Chundrigar Road and Abdullah Haroon Road as well as on adjoining streets, while several others moved with a snail’s pace on almost every other street of the South district.\n\nPeople had to wait for over an hour to get out of the traffic mess, especially at the Shaheen Complex, PIDC, Metropole Hotel, in Saddar areas and its neighbourhoods.\n\nEarlier at a meeting, the senior minister assured the transporters that the provincial government would address their concerns and resolve their issues.\n\nHe requested shipping companies and importers not to put pressure on transporters, saying that the business system across the country had been severely affected by the protest. “The chief secretary will also write to the shipping companies to ensure that no additional fare or fines are imposed on the transporters,” he added.\n\nLater, the senior minister along with a delegation of transporters reached the protest site to hold direct negotiations with the Pakistan Goods Transport Association, led by Nisar Hussain Jafri, and the United Goods Transport Association, represented by Ghulam Yasin Niazi.\n\nAddressing them, he said that the provincial government was fully aware of the challenges faced by the transport community experiencing difficulties for some time.\n\nHe informed them that there was a meeting held earlier in the day, where some important decisions were made.\n\nThe minister said a committee was also formed to investigate the vehicles which were burned at different times and the commissioner and transport secretary would oversee the inquiry and arrange compensation for the damages.\n\nHe said that thousands of vehicles were stuck due to the sit-in, with food items, livestock, and other goods being delayed. “Yesterday, Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah spoke with the prime minister and recommended convening a CCI meeting soon.”\n\nThe senior minister expressed hope that good news would follow and that all roads would be reopened. “We want all transport to reach its destinations as soon as possible,” he added.\n\nHe said that the country was facing numerous challenges, and people were currently enduring significant difficulties due to the road blockages.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
