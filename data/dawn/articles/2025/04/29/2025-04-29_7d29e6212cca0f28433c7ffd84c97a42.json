  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Monday ordered a halt to construction of a flyover on Samungli Road and directed authorities to explore a cheaper alternative, such as an underpass.\n\nA divisional bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Khan Mulakhail and Justice Muhammad Najamuddin Mengal issued the directive during a hearing on a constitutional petition challenging the project.\n\nThe court was informed that the estimated cost of the flyover, including land acquisition, would be Rs4.2 billion. In response, the bench instructed the project director of the CM’s Quetta development team to immediately stop construction.\n\n“The authorities must consider cost-effective alternatives,” the judges observed during the hearing.\n\nThe project director was asked whether building an underpass was feasible. He requested additional time to conduct a fresh survey for a proposed east-west underpass. Granting the request, the court directed him to prepare a comparative table outlining the costs of land acquisition and construction for both options — the flyover and the underpass.\n\nUntil further orders, no construction work on the flyover should continue, the court ruled.\n\nAdvocate Muhammad Ishaq Nasar and the project director both requested copies of the petition to submit their comments, which the court provided. A copy of the court’s order was also sent to the Office of the Additional Attorney General for information and compliance. The hearing was adjourned until May 15.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
