  "content": "Information Minister Attaullah Tarar early Wednesday morning said that “credible intelligence” reports indicated that India was planning to conduct a military action against Pakistan in the next 24 to 36 hours amid tensions between the two countries after the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir last week that New Delhi blamed on Islamabad, albeit without proof.\n\nA day earlier, India gave its military “operational freedom” to respond to the deadly attack in occupied Kashmir last week.\n\nSpeaking to the media hours after the development, Tarar said: “Pakistan has credible intelligence that India intends carrying out military action against Pakistan in the next 24-36 hours on the pretext of baseless and concocted allegations of involvement in the Pahalgam incident.”\n\nHe said Pakistan vehemently rejected “Indian self-assumed hubristic role of judge, jury and executioner in the region” which was completely “reckless”.\n\n“Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism itself and truly understands the pain of this scourge,” he said, adding: “We have always condemned it in all its forms and manifestations anywhere in the world.”\n\nBeing a responsible state, he said Pakistan “openheartedly offered a credible, transparent and independent investigation” by a neutral commission of experts to ascertain the truth.\n\n“Unfortunately, rather than pursuing the path of reason, India has apparently decided to tread the dangerous path of irrationality and confrontation, which will have catastrophic consequences for the complete region and beyond,” the minister stressed.\n\nHe said the “evasion of credible investigations is in itself sufficient evidence exposing India’s real motives.”\n\n“Consciously making strategic decisions hostage to public sentiments, purposefully trumped up for securing political objectives, is unfortunate and deplorable,” the minister added.\n\nTarar reiterated that any such military adventurism by India would be responded to assuredly and decisively.\n\n“The international community must remain alive to the reality that the onus of escalatory spiral and its ensuing consequences shall squarely lie with India,” Tarar emphasised.\n\nHe reiterated the nation’s resolve to defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan at all costs.\n\nA week after the Pahalgam attack, Modi held a closed-door meeting with army and security chiefs, during which he told the armed forces that they had the “complete operational freedom to decide on the mode, targets and timing of our response to the terror attack”, a senior government source who was not authorised to speak to the media told AFP on Tuesday.\n\nThe government released video images of a stern-faced Modi meeting with army chiefs, as well as Defence Minister Rajnath Singh.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, India’s army said it had repeatedly traded gunfire with Pakistani troops across the Line of Control (LoC). The two neighbours have been trading fire across the LoC for five days now, with each blaming the other for provocation.\n\nThe Pakistan Army did not confirm the shooting, but state media reported on Tuesday it had shot down an Indian drone, calling it a violation of its airspace.\n\nIt did not say when the incident happened, and there was no comment from New Delhi.\n\nIndia alleged the “Pakistan Army resorted to unprovoked small arms firing across the LoC” overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the fifth night in a row that fire was exchanged there.\n\nThe Indian army said its troops had “responded in a measured and effective manner to the provocation”. There were no reports of casualties.\n\nMeanwhile, United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres held calls with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and India’s foreign minister to express “deep concern at rising tensions”, his spokesman said on Tuesday.\n\nThe UN chief “underscored the need to avoid a confrontation that could result in tragic consequences. He offered his good offices to support de-escalation efforts”, spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.\n\nDuring the telephone call, the prime minister affirmed that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, while highlighting the significant sacrifices rendered by the country in the global war against terror.\n\nWhile rejecting Indian accusations against Pakistan as “baseless”, the prime minister categorically rejected any attempt to link Pakistan with the Pahalgam incident and reiterated his call for a transparent and neutral investigation into the incident.\n\nHe expressed serious concerns over India’s attempts to delegitimise the Kashmiri freedom struggle by using the bogey of terrorism, as well as its widely documented state-sponsored terrorism in occupied Kashmir.\n\nHe particularly highlighted India’s weaponisation of the waters of the Indus Basin as unacceptable, while noting that water was the lifeline of 240 million people.\n\nWhile underscoring that Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity with full force in case of any misadventure by India, the prime minister encouraged the UN chief to counsel India to “act responsibly and exercise restraint”.\n\nHe emphasised that the unresolved issue of Jammu and Kashmir remained the root cause of instability in South Asia, and urged the UN chief to play his role for its just resolution, in accordance with relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.\n\nThe prime minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment towards fostering international peace and security as a responsible member of the international community and a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.\n\nThe UN chief appreciated Pakistan’s efforts for peace in South Asia and said that the world could not afford any escalation in the region at the crucial time.\n\nRelations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have plummeted after India accused Pakistan of backing an attack in occupied Kashmir on April 22 in which 26 men were killed.\n\nIslamabad has rejected the charge and both countries have since exchanged gunfire and diplomatic barbs, as well as expelled citizens and ordered the main land border crossing shut.\n\nLast week, Modi vowed to pursue those who carried out the attack in the tourist hotspot of Pahalgam and those who had supported it.\n\n“I say to the whole world: India will identify, track and punish every terrorist and their backer,” he said on Thursday.\n\n“We will pursue them to the ends of the Earth”.\n\nThe bellicose statements have prompted worries of a rapid spiral into military action, with several nations, including neighbouring China, calling for restraint and dialogue.\n\nFreedom fighters in the Indian-occupied area have waged a battle since 1989, seeking independence or a merger with Pakistan.\n\nPakistan and India both claim Kashmir in full since their independence from British rule in 1947.\n\nIndian police have issued wanted posters for three men accused of carrying out the attack — two alleged Pakistanis and an Indian — who they claim are members of the Lashkar-e-Taiba group, a UN-designated terrorist organisation.\n\nThey have announced a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest and carried out sweeping detentions seeking anyone suspected of links to the alleged killers.\n\nThe worst attack in recent years in occupied Kashmir was at Pulwama in 2019, when a person rammed a car packed with explosives into a security forces convoy, killing 40 and wounding 35.\n\nIndian fighter jets carried out air strikes on Pakistani territory 12 days later. The next day, the Pakistan Air Force undertook strikes across the LoC from Pakistani airspace.\n\nIran has already offered to mediate and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”.\n\nUS President Donald Trump downplayed tensions, saying on Friday the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.",
