  "content": "The Pakistan Army on Tuesday shot down an Indian quadcopter drone near the Line of Control (LoC) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), state media reported, as tensions between the two countries linger on in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.\n\nThe April 22 attack killed 26 men, mostly tourists, and was one of the deadliest armed attacks in the disputed Himalayan region since 2000. Kashmir Resistance, also known as The Resistance Front, said it “unequivocally” denied involvement in the attack, after an initial message that claimed responsibility.\n\nIndia, without offering any evidence, has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan has strongly denied any involvement. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called for a neutral probe into the incident.\n\n“Pakistan has successfully shot down an Indian quadcopter along the Line of Control, thwarting a violation of its airspace,” state-run Radio Pakistan and PTV News reported, citing security sources.\n\nSpecifying the location, security sources said the “enemy attempted to conduct surveillance using a quadcopter” in the Manawar sector of Bhimber district in AJK.\n\n“The Pakistan Army, through timely action, foiled this nefarious attempt by the enemy,” the report added.\n\nThe security sources termed the incident a “clear testimony to the vigilance, professional skill and defensive preparedness of the Pakistan Army”.\n\n“The Pakistan Army is always ready to give an immediate and effective response to any aggression from the enemy,” the report read, adding that the entire nation stood “united with the armed forces to give a befitting response to the enemy on every front”.\n\nThe development comes as Indian and Pakistani soldiers reportedly traded fire along the LoC for a fifth straight night, after four years of relative calm.\n\nThe Indian army said its soldiers and Pakistani forces fired at each other overnight. There was no immediate confirmation from Pakistan.\n\nIndia said that overnight from Monday to Tuesday, the gunfire took place in areas opposite the Kupwara and Baramulla districts in held Kashmir, as well as in the Akhnoor sector.\n\nThere were no reports of casualties.\n\nIn the latest of this heated debate, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif yesterday said Pakistan was ready for any incursion by India.\n\n“We have reinforced our forces because it is something which is imminent now. So in that situation, some strategic decisions have to be taken, so those decisions have been taken,” Asif told Reuters.\n\nHe said the military had briefed the government on the possibility of an Indian attack, but did not go into further details on his reasons for thinking an incursion was imminent.\n\nIn an interview with Samaa TV, Asif warned there was a “war looming on the horizon”, and later told Geo News that the “next two to three days were crucial”.\n\nCalls have also grown from Indian politicians and others for military action against Pakistan. Analysts say they fear bellicose statements will escalate into possible military action.\n\nPakistan is preparing international legal action over India’s suspension of the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT), Minister of State for Law and Justice Aqeel Malik told Reuters late on Monday.\n\nMalik said Islamabad was working on plans for at least three different legal options, including raising the issue at the World Bank, the treaty’s facilitator.\n\nIt was also considering taking action at the Permanent Court of Arbitration or at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, where it could allege that India has violated the 1960 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, he said.\n\n“Legal strategy consultations are almost complete,” Malik said, adding the decision on which cases to pursue would be made “soon” and would likely include pursuing more than one avenue.\n\nIndia’s water resources officials did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request seeking comment.\n\nMalik added that a fourth diplomatic option that Islamabad was considering was to raise the issue at the United Nations Security Council.\n\n“All the options are on the table and we are pursuing all appropriate and competent forums to approach,” he said. “The treaty cannot be suspended unilaterally and cannot be held in abeyance, there is not [such a] provision within the treaty,” he asserted.\n\nSince the Pahalgam attack, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other.\n\nIndia on April 23 unilaterally suspended the IWT — a water-sharing agreement that was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.\n\nThe next day, Pakistan retaliated by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights. The National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad also said “any attempt to stop or divert the flow of water belonging to Pakistan […] will be considered as an act of war”.\n\nThe treaty is an agreement for the distribution and use of waters from the Indus River and its tributaries, which feed 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture and its hydropower.\n\nKushvinder Vohra, a recently retired head of India’s Central Water Commission, told Reuters: “There are very limited options [for Pakistan] … I can say that there are solid grounds for us to defend our action.”\n\nGovernment officials and experts on both sides say India cannot stop water flows immediately, because the treaty has allowed it to only build hydropower plants without significant storage or dams on the three rivers allocated to Pakistan.\n\nBut things could start changing in a few months, and farmers, already hit by climate-change-related water shortages, have raised concerns.\n\nIn a related development, Minister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima Khawaja has said that cyberattack attempts on the websites of some ministries were foiled.\n\nResponding to a query yesterday about cyberattacks from India, Khawaja said: “There were [cyberattacks] on some ministries, but we defended against them successfully. There was no huge issue.\n\n“They were resolved timely,” she told reporters at her ministry’s office in Islamabad, clarifying there was no cyberattack on the IT ministry’s website.\n\nKhawaja highlighted that the National Cyber Emergency Resp­onse Team (N-Cert) and its provincial counterparts were functional.\n\nThe minister pointed out that Pakistan had been listed among the top countries in cybersecurity last year, recalling the Top Tier-1 ranking in the ITU-Global Cybersecurity Index (GCI-V5) 2024.\n\nSpeaking on the Pahalgam attack, she asserted Pakistan had always condemned terrorism and advocated peace.\n\n“It is in no one’s interest that the situation escalates,” Khawaja said about the ongoing Pakistan-India friction.\n\nAlso yesterday, N-cert, which is responsible for the security of critical digital infrastructure, warned media and content creators against sharing sensitive national security information.\n\nIn an advisory, it noted there had been an “uptick in the circulation of videos, images, and commentary revealing troop movements, military deployments, and sensitive national security activities” on social media and public forums.\n\n“ Such disclosures — whether inadvertent or intentional — may severely compromise national security, jeopardise operational effectiveness, and facilitate hostile actions by adversaries,“ N-cert said.\n\nThe advisory added that disseminating sensitive material may result in a security breach by disclosing the locations and movements of troops.\n\nMore than half of the tourist destinations in India-occupied Kashmir (IoK) have been closed to the public from Tuesday, according to a government order reviewed by Reuters, in a bid to tighten security after last week’s attack on holiday-makers.\n\nThe assailants segregated men, asked their names and targeted Hindus before shooting them at close range in the Pahalgam area, killing 26 people, officials and survivors said.\n\nThe local government has decided to shut 48 of the 87 tourist destinations in IoK and enhanced security at the remaining ones, according to the government document.\n\nNo time period was given. Government officials did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment.\n\nNestled in the Himalayas with lofty peaks, picturesque valleys and grand Mughal-era gardens, the territory has been emerging as India’s tourism hotspot as violence there has waned in recent years.\n\nBut the Pahalgam attack has left panic-stricken tourists seeking an early exit at the start of the busy summer season.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Arab Emirates today joined other countries in stressing the importance of “promoting dialogue” to defuse tensions between arch-rivals India and Pakistan in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.\n\nUAE Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, in a phone call with his Pakistani counterpart Ishaq Dar, discussed the recent regional situation and matters of mutual concern, the Foreign Office (FO) said on X.\n\nDar apprised the UAE official of the decisions made by Pakistan’s National Security Committee last week in response to “India’s unfounded allegations, inflammatory rhetoric and unilateral actions”.\n\nThe UAE deputy PM “emphasised the importance of upholding regional stability, promoting dialogue, exercising restraint and peaceful resolution of disputes”, according to the FO.\n\n“Reaffirming the strong fraternal ties between Pakistan and the UAE, both leaders committed to maintaining close coordination and consultations in light of [the] evolving regional situation.”\n\nBoth deputy premiers also expressed their countries’ resolve to “enhance bilateral cooperation and advance shared objectives of peace, stability, and sustainable development”, the FO stated.\n\nOther friendly countries and global powers have also sought de-escalation of tensions between Pakistan and India — including the United States, the United Kingdom, China, Turkiye, and Qatar.\n\nYesterday, China said it hoped the two sides would “exercise restraint, meet each other halfway, properly handle relevant differences through dialogue and consultation, and jointly maintain regional peace and stability”.\n\nTurkiye’s President Recep Tayyip Erdogan also called for a swift de-escalation of the brewing crisis, Anadolu Agency reported on Monday.\n\n“We want the escalating tensions between Pakistan and India to be de-escalated as soon as possible, before they evolve into a more serious situation,” Erdogan said after a cabinet meeting in Ankara.\n\n“Türkiye emphasises at every opportunity that we do not want new conflicts in our region and beyond,” he stressed.\n\nThe United Nations has urged the arch-rivals to show “maximum restraint” so that issues can be “resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.\n\nIran has already offered to mediate, and Saudi Arabia has said Riyadh was trying to “prevent an escalation”. US President Donald Trump on Friday downplayed tensions, saying the dispute will get “figured out, one way or another”.\n\nAdditional input from AFP",
