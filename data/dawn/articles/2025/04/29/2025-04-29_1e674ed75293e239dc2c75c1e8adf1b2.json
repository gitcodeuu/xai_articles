  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro of the Islamabad High Court on Monday issued notices to multiple authorities, seeking their response regarding a petition filed by Aleema Khan, sister of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder Imran Khan, challenging the inclusion of her name on the travel ban list.\n\nDuring the hearing, Aleema Khan’s counsel, Advocate Khalid Yousuf Chaudhry argued that his client was being subjected to political victimisation due to her familial association with Imran Khan.\n\nHe informed the court that Aleema Khan served on the boards of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Namal University and needs to travel abroad, specifically to the United Kingdom, for crucial fundraising activities.\n\nThe court inquired whether any proceedings under Section 87 or 88 of the Criminal Procedure Code were pending against the petitioner.\n\nThe counsel confirmed that no such proceedings were underway and emphasised that Aleema Khan had obtained bail where required and was fully cooperating with the judicial process.\n\nHighlighting the urgency of the matter, the lawyer requested the immediate removal of Aleema Khan’s name from the travel restrictions to allow her to fulfill her fundraising commitments.\n\nResponding to the arguments, the court annulled the earlier order that had placed her name on the travel ban list.\n\nJustice Soomro directed the relevant authorities, including the home secretary, Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), and the director general of immigration to submit their detailed reports by May 5, 2025. Until then, the matter remains under judicial consideration.\n\nMeanwhile, hearing of the Toshakhana case related to Bulgari Jewellery set against Mr Khan and Bushra Bibi was adjourned without proceeding at the Federal Investigation Agency’s Special Court Central.\n\nThe case, which was initially scheduled to be heard at Adiala Jail, was instead conducted at the Federal Judicial Complex in Islamabad.\n\nThe court session was attended by several lawyers, including Chaudhry Zaheer Abbas, Usman Riaz Gul and Naeem Haider Panjotha, who appeared on behalf of the accused.\n\nThe court decided to adjourn the hearing until May 14, citing the unavailability of the accused in jail for the trial.\n\nThe court issued a written order explaining that the hearing could not take place at Adiala Jail due to ongoing cases at the facility. It was also noted that the medical report presented by the jail authorities, concerning the health of the PTI founder, was unsatisfactory.\n\nAccording to the report, dated January 10, 2025, medical examinations had been conducted by a team of doctors, including Dr Mohammad Asim Yousaf, Dr Faisal Sultan and dentist Samina Niazi. However, the latest medical report presented contradicted this earlier evaluation, prompting the court to instruct the Adiala Jail superintendent to arrange for a new medical examination.\n\nThe new examination will be conducted by a specialised medical team from Pims, with three private doctors of Mr Khan included to ensure comprehensive treatment.\n\nThe court’s order emphasised the importance of proper care for the accused during the proceedings.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
