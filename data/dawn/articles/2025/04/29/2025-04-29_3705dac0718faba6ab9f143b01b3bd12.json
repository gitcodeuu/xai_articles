The country’s weak productivity growth has contributed to the frequent balance of payments crises, with the economy stuck in a recurring boom-bust cycle.\n\nSBP eyes economy expanding by 2.5-3.5pc in FY25\n\n“Risks to growth projection are, nonetheless, tilted on the downside,” said the report.\n\nMoreover, any further shortfall in tax revenue remains a major upside risk. These projections incorporate the expected increase in inflation in the last few months of FY25 due to the fading high base effect, the report said.\n\nThe Large-Scale Manufact­u­ring (LSM) also declined by 1.9pc during July-February FY25. The slight uptick in services sector growth was largely supported by general government, information and communication, and other private services.\n\nThis, along with lower contraction in industry, was also reflected in a marginal increase in employment and employment sentiments, said the report.\n\nThe resulting steady momentum in exports and robust workers’ remittances outweighed the volume-driven increase in imports and helped comfortably finance higher repatriation of profits and dividends.\n\nThese developments collectively resulted in a surplus in the current account balance and stability in the exchange rate, enabling the SBP to build external buffers through FX purchases.\n\nAccordingly, the government contained non-interest spending, especially development expenditures and subsidies, to achieve the envisaged fiscal consolidation in 1HFY25.\n\nThese trends highlight the need for structural reforms to broaden the tax base that would not only support investment and development needs of the economy, but would also help reduce burden on existing taxpayers such as salaried individuals, corporates and other documented sectors, said the report.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
