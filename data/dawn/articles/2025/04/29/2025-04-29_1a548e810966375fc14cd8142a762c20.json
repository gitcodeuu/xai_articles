  "content": "Prime Minister Mark Carney won Canada’s election on Monday, local media projected, leading his Liberal Party to a new term in power after convincing voters his experience managing economic crises prepared him to confront United States President Donald Trump.\n\nThe public broadcaster CBC and other outlets projected the Liberals would form Canada’s next government, but it was not yet clear if they would hold a majority in parliament.\n\nConservative leader Pierre Poilievre fell short of becoming prime minister, but his party was on track to form a strong opposition in parliament\n\nTrump’s trade war and threats to annex Canada — which he renewed in an election day social media post — outraged Canadians and made dealing with the US a top campaign issue.\n\nCarney, who had never held elected office and only replaced Justin Trudeau as prime minister last month, anchored his campaign on an anti-Trump message.\n\nHe previously served as central bank governor in both Britain and Canada and persuaded voters his global financial experience has prepared him to guide Canada through a trade war.\n\nCarney, who also had a lucrative career as investment banker before joining Canada’s public service, promised to expand overseas trading relations to curb Canada’s reliance on the United States.\n\nCarney’s descriptions of the Trump threat have been stark.\n\n“Donald Trump wants to break us so America can own us,” he said during the campaign.\n\n“They want our resources, they want our water, they want our land, they want our country. They can’t have it.”\n\nWhen the CBC projection was announced, cheers of joy erupted at the Ottawa venue where Liberal supporters were watching the results.\n\n“I’m happy in the sense that we’ve got somebody that can speak to Mr. Trump on his level,” said Dorothy Goubault, 72. “Mr. Trump is a business person. Mr. Carney is a business person, and I think they can both relate.”\n\nBefore Trudeau resigned, Trump had mocked him, calling the prime minister “governor” as he urged Canada to become the 51st US state.\n\nGoubault said she expects that mockery to stop.\n\n“It’s not the governor anymore, it’s the prime minister of Canada, and it’s not the 51st state anymore. It’s ‘We are Canada!’”\n\nLiberal lawmaker and a member of Carney’s cabinet, Steven Guilbeault, tied the outcome to Trump.\n\n“The numerous attacks by President Trump on the Canadian economy, but not just the economy, on our sovereignty and our very identity, I think have really mobilised Canadians, and I think they saw in Prime Minister Carney someone who has experience on the world stage,” he told the CBC.\n\nThe departure of former prime minister Justin Trudeau was also crucial to the Liberal win, which capped one of the most dramatic turnarounds in Canadian political history.\n\nOn January 6, the day Trudeau announced he would resign, the Conservatives led the Liberals by more than 20 points in most polls, as voter anger over soaring coasts mounted after Trudeau’s decade in power.\n\nBut Carney replacing Trudeau, combined with nationwide unease about Trump, transformed the race.\n\nCarney, 60, distanced himself from Trudeau throughout the campaign.\n\nHe said the former prime minister did not focus enough on growing Canada’s economy and scrapped a controversial Trudeau tax on carbon emissions that left many voters seething.\n\nFor Poilievre, a 45-year-old who has been in parliament for two decades, the outcome marks a stinging defeat.\n\nHe was criticised for the at-times muted anger he directed towards Trump, but said he wanted to keep the focus on domestic concerns that drove Trudeau’s unpopularity.\n\nHe tried to persuade voters that Carney would simply offer a continuation of the failed Liberal governance, an argument that fell short.\n\nAt the Conservative watch party in Ottawa, Jason Piche told AFP he was surprised by the result.\n\n“I was hoping to have a big celebration tonight,” Piche said.\n\nNearly 29 million of Canada’s 41 million people were eligible to vote in the massive G7 country that spans six time zones. A record 7.3 million people cast advanced ballots.\n\nResults were still pending on the shape of Canada’s 343 members of parliament, with 172 seats needed for a majority. The Liberals won a majority in 2015 but have governed with a minority since 2019.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated his Canadian counterpart on his election victory.\n\n“Pakistan and Canada enjoy warm and friendly relations, and we are proud of the vibrant Pakistani diaspora in Canada,” PM Shehbaz said in a post on X.\n\n“I look forward to working together with Prime Minister Carney to further deepen our partnership and create greater opportunities for our nations.”\n\nIndia’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi also congratulated Carney on his election, suggesting hopes of a possible reset of fraught relations between New Delhi and Ottawa.\n\n“I look forward to working with you to strengthen our partnership and unlock greater opportunities for our people,” Modi said in a statement.\n\n“India and Canada are bound by shared democratic values, a steadfast commitment to the rule of law, and vibrant people-to-people ties,” he added.\n\nTies between Canada and India were strained following accusations of New Delhi’s involvement in the assassination of a Canadian Sikh, claims India denied.\n\nMeanwhile, China said it was open to improving ties with Canada.\n\n“China is willing to develop China-Canada relations on the basis of mutual respect, equality, and mutual benefit,” foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun said.\n\nBeijing on Tuesday stopped short of congratulating Carney, but said: “China’s position on China-Canada relations is consistent and clear.” Ties between Beijing and Ottawa have been tense in recent years.\n\nThe arrest of a senior Chinese telecom executive on a US warrant in Vancouver in December 2018 and Beijing’s retaliatory detention of two Canadians on espionage charges plunged relations into a deep freeze.\n\nTies were strained further over allegations of Chinese interference in Canadian elections in 2019 and 2021, charges Beijing has denied.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated Carney on his election win, expressing hope the two countries would forge stronger ties under his premiership.\n\n“We are sincerely grateful for Canada’s principled leadership in supporting Ukraine… We are confident that our partnership will only grow stronger in our shared pursuit of peace, justice, and security,” Zelensky said in a post on X.\n\nFrance’s President Emmanuel Macron, congratulated Carney on his election win, saying he believed the Liberal Party leader embodied a “strong Canada”.\n\n“You embody a strong Canada in the face of the great challenges of our time. France looks forward to further strengthening the friendship that binds our countries. Eager to work alongside you,” he said on X.\n\nBritish leader Keir Starmer also congratulated Carney and said he looked forward to strengthening ties between the two countries.\n\n“Congratulations to Mark Carney on your election victory. The UK and Canada are the closest of allies, partners and friends,” Starmer said in a statement.\n\n“Our partnership is based on shared history and values, with a shared sovereign, and I look forward to strengthening our ties”.",
