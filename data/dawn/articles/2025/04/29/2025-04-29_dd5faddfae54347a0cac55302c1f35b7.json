Subsequently, the case was not fixed before Justice Sattar on April 28 as was scheduled.\n\nJustice Sattar lambasted the deputy registrar (judicial) for what he described as “prima facie defiance” of court orders.\n\nHe noted irregularities in the handling of the intra-court appeal, warning the hearing by the division bench might not have been properly assisted regarding the jurisdiction.\n\nJustice Sattar has summoned court officials to explain why the case was not listed before him and also the removal of his prior orders from the high court’s public database.\n\nThe next hearing has been fixed for May 7.\n\nNotices suspended\n\nOn the same day, the IHC division bench, comprising Justice Dogar and Justice Asif took a different view of the matter.\n\nHearing the same appeal, the bench suspended the contempt of court notices issued by Justice Sattar.\n\nIt also set aside Justice Sattar’s eight-page order, with acting Chief Justice Dogar questioning the legit­imacy of the proceedings.\n\n“How can he pass an order when he does not have the case?” he asked sharply, suggesting the controversy could spark widespread public attention.\n\nLater, the bench adjourned the hearing on the intra-court appeal.\n\nThe developments have once again highlighted deep fissures within the IHC, as Justice Sattar and acting CJ Dogar are also involved in a legal battle over the seniority of judges in IHC.\n\nJustice Dogar was one of the three judges transferred from other provincial high courts to the IHC in February.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
