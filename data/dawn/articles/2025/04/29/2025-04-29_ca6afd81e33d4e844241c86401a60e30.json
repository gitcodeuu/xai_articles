He warned that India’s attempts to “weaponise water” posed a serious threat to the region’s peace and stability.\n\n“The waters of the Indus River System remain a lifeline for Pakistan’s 240 million people,” he said, underscoring the strategic and humanitarian importance of preserving the treaty.\n\nHe reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to safeguarding its rightful share of water under the treaty and pledged to continue advocating for its full implementation to protect the country’s water security and the well-being of its people.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
