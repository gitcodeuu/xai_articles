  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Former Dutch hockey great Floris Jan Bovelander on Monday expressed optimism about the future of hockey in Pakistan, stating that with proper training and international exposure, the national game could regain its former glory.\n\nBovelander, who was instrumental in the Netherlands’ triumph at the 1990 Hockey World Cup, is currently visiting Pakistan to conduct a training clinic for young players from Islamabad and Rawalpindi. He is also scheduled to hold a session in Lahore.\n\nDuring the clinic, the legendary drag-flicker provided guidance on modern penalty corner techniques, game awareness and offensive strategies.\n\n“Talent is important, but achieving success in international hockey requires a combination of hard work and intelligent training,” he told reporters during the session held at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium.\n\n![ .](https://www.dawn.com/news/18906570\n\nThe event was organised by the Khawaja Junaid Hockey Academy (KJHA) in collaboration with the Embassy of the Netherlands and the Pakistan Sports Board, as part of celebrations marking Dutch King’s Day.\n\nA number of young players, former Olympians, national team members, coaches, sports officials and diplomats, including Dutch Ambassador Henny de Vries, were present on the occasion.\n\nSecretary of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani, who also attended the session, described Bovelander’s visit as a welcome initiative in support of Pakistan’s hockey revival.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Wani said that during his meeting with the Dutch star, the lack of Astroturf facilities across the country was discussed.\n\n“Currently, there are around 40 Astroturf surfaces in Pakistan. We have now set a target to double this number to 80 over the next five years,” he said, adding that the federal government was committed to taking further steps to improve hockey infrastructure.\n\nFormer Olympian Khawaja Mohammad Junaid, who heads the KJHA, termed Bovelander’s visit a “timely boost” for ongoing efforts to rejuvenate the sport in Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
