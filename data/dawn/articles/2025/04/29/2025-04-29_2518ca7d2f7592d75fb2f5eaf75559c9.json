India cannot simply walk away from its obligations,” he stressed.\n\nSenator Zafar of PTI also agreed with Mr Siddiqui saying that India has no right to unilaterally suspend, amend or cancel the treaty.\n\nMr Zafar, who is also a constitutional expert, said any such action by the Modi government will be “illegal and against the principles of international law”.\n\nHe said the announcement by India to suspend the treaty had no legal effect and Pakistan has rejected it.\n\nCalling water a “basic human right”, he warned India that any disruption to the water flows of Pakistan would be “an act of war”.\n\n“We will fight for each drop of water till the last drop of our blood.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
