  "content": "CHATTOGRAM: Bangladesh’s left-arm spinner Taijul Islam registered his 16th five-wicket haul as Zimbabwe slumped to 227-9 at the end of the first day of the second Test in Chattogram on Monday.\n\nNick Welch and Sean Williams each scored fifties for the visitors but the day belonged to Bangladesh as they sought to level the two-match series after losing the opener.\n\nZimbabwe got off to a decent start after winning the toss and opting to bat but lost both openers in quick succession.\n\nDebutant Tanzim Hasan Sakib made the first breakthrough, getting Brian Bennett caught behind off an outside edge.\n\nTaijul struck with the second delivery of his spell, removing Ben Curran when the opener chopped one onto his stumps for 21 off 50 balls.\n\nWelch and Williams steadied the innings but their dismissals triggered a collapse, with Taijul getting four wickets in the final session.\n\nHe dismissed Wessly Madhevere for 15 in the 79th over and then struck twice more quickly, sending back Wellington Masakadza for six and Richard Ngarava for a first-ball duck.\n\nTaijul claimed his fifth wicket with five overs remaining in the day, removing Welch for 54 to leave Zimbabwe reeling.\n\nHowever, tailender Blessing Muzarabani held firm with Tafadzwa Tsiga to survive the rest of the day.\n\nTaijul finished with 5-60, while his spin partner Nayeem Hasan chipped in with two wickets.\n\nBangladesh made three changes, recalling Anamul Haque and Nayeem Hasan, and handing right-arm paceman Sakib his Test debut.\n\nAnamul’s return came after four centuries in domestic cricket.\n\nMahmudul Hasan Joy, Nahid Rana and Khaled Ahmed were dropped to make room for them.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nZIMBABWE (1st Innings):\n\nB.
