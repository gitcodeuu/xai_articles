  "content": "SRINAGAR / AMRITSAR: Anger is growing among the local population in the wake of sweeping detentions and the indiscriminate demolition suspects’ homes in India-held Kashmir, amid a hunt for the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack.\n\nIndia has pointed the finger at Pakistan — without any proof — and unleashed a raft of provocative actions, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty in the wake of the incident.\n\nMeanwhile, police have launched a vast manhunt across held Kashmir and detained around 2,000 people for questioning.\n\nThey have announced a two million rupee ($23,500) bounty for information leading to each man’s arrest.\n\nResidents of border villages fear getting caught in the crossfire if fighting breaks out\n\nWhile several groups have protested the attack, the crackdown has also sparked warnings that the wider public is suffering during the search for the few.\n\nAga Ruhullah, a federal lawmaker from Kashmir, said: “Kashmir and Kashmiris are being given a collective punishment.”\n\nDemolitions and detentions\n\nThe homes of men suspected of having links to the attackers have also been blown up at night.\n\nYasmeena, the sister of fugitive accused Asif Sheikh, said her family was being punished, with their home was demolished even though they had not seen him for three years.\n\n“If my brother is involved, how is it the family’s sin?” she said. “This house doesn’t belong to him alone.”\n\nIndian police have issued wanted posters for three men — one Indian and two men alleged to be Pakistanis. However, police are hunting for at least two local suspects, and the demolition of several homes in held Kashmir seems to contradict New Delhi’s claim that the attackers hailed from Pakistan.\n\nPolice are also sweeping up those they suspect may have information on the attackers.\n\n“It’s a revolving door in police stations as part of the ongoing investigation,” said a senior police official told AFP.\n\n“Some have already been let go, and more are being summoned to police stations,” the officer said, adding: “These are not arrests, just for seeking information that could lead to the terrorists”.\n\nFear grips border villages\n\nIn Daoke village on the Indian border, residents say nothing has changed on the ground yet — but there is a growing anxiety about the coming weeks.\n\n“The barbaric attack on the civilians in Kashmir was tragic, but no matter what, the lives lost are not coming back,” says Hardev Singh, 65.\n\n“Any war would push both our countries back by many years, and there would be an even bigger loss of human lives.”\n\nHe has lived through two conflicts — in 1971 and 1999 — and knows the drill if fighting erupts again.\n\nA border fence patrolled by troops slices in two the farmlands near Daoke, home to around 1,500 people.\n\nIn the nearby border village of Rajatal, located between Amritsar and Lahore, residents remember the days when the golden farmland stretched without restriction.\n\n“We used to go to the open ground on the other side to graze our cattle,” recalls 77-year-old Sardar Lakha Singh, sitting about 100 metres from fences topped with barbed wire.\n\nFarmers can now obtain special passes to go close to the border, including beyond the fence but still within Indian territory, but they must always be accompanied by a soldier.\n\nPanic gripped border villages last week after rumours suggested farmers would be stopped from accessing fields too close to Pakistan.\n\nSikh elder Sardar Lakha Sin­gh advised younger villagers to accept their fate and not to worry. “Whatever is going to happen will happen anyway,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 29th, 2025",
