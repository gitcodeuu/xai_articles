  "content": "LONDON: Former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has expressed optimism about the country’s direction, praising the current leadership and emphasising the need for collective efforts for national progress.\n\nDuring an informal chat with journalists and party workers at a London hotel, the PML-N leader lauded PM Shehbaz Sharif for his handling of the country’s economic challenges. “Shehbaz Sharif has successfully stabilised the economy and put it back on its feet,” he said, adding that the government is committed to merit-based governance across the board.\n\nDispelling recent rumours, Nawaz Sharif clarified that he is in perfect health and termed the circulating reports as baseless. He also highlighted the development achievements under the PML-N leadership, pointing to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s role in Punjab.\n\n“Maryam Nawaz has set new benchmarks for development in Punjab, and she is ensuring that all initiatives are carried out strictly on merit,” he said.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of unity, urging all stakeholders to come together and play their role in the country’s development. “Everyone must contribute to Pakistan’s progress.”\n\nIn response to questions about the outcomes of ‘Sharif diplomacy’ — a term coined by a journalist to describe the Sharif brothers’ personal relationships with foreign dignitaries — he recalled the impromptu visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi some years ago, questioning why opportunities to improve bilateral relations were not further capitalised upon.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
