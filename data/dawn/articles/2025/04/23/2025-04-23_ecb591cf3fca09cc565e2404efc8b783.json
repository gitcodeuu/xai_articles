  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) has started the process to install e-gates at major airports across the country.\n\nAccording to a PAA press release issued on Tuesday, an agreement has been signed to start the process of planning, design and installation of e-gates at Islamabad, Lahore and Karachi airports.\n\nE-gates, also known as electronic gates, are automated passport control systems that use biom­etric technology to auth­enticate the identity of passengers. They process passengers’ details without the need for manual verification.\n\nA delegation from M2PConsulting, a foreign company, visited the PAA headquarters to sign the agreement.\n\nPrior to the signing, talks were held to discuss key technical and operational aspects of the project.\n\nThe meeting was chaired by Deputy DG (Airports) Sadiqur Rehman and Deputy DG (Works and Development) Sumair Saeed.\n\nThe discussions included the integration of the e-gate system with UN’s International Civil Aviation Organisation protocols and local airport agency systems.\n\nChristophe Mostert, the managing partner of M2P Consulting, and Kashif S. Jillani, PAA Director (Engineering Services), signed the agreement.\n\nThe planning, design, implementation, and installation process is expected to be completed within two years.\n\nThe consultants will provide technical supervision and guide contractors selected through a competitive tendering process, the press release stated.\n\nAccording to PAA, surveys at Lahore and Islamabad airports have been completed, while a survey at Karachi’s Jinnah International Airport will begin today (Wednesday).\n\nOnce installed, e-gates will enhance passenger security, introduce automated control and reduce reliance on manual processing, the PAA added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
