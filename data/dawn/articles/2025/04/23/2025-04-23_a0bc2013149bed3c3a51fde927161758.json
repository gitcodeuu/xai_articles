  "content": "WASHINGTON: Presi­dent Donald Trump’s top diplomat Marco Rubio unveiled a restructuring of the US State Depart­ment on Tuesday that will cut positions and scale back human rights offices, saying the “bloated” organisation was ideologically out of sync with the administration.\n\nRubio billed the plan as a major shake-up in the State Department, long a bete noire for many conservatives, although the outline was less drastic than drafts that have circulated — including one of which would have virtually wiped out day-to-day diplomacy in Africa.\n\n“The Department is bloated, bureaucratic and unable to perform its essential diplomatic mission in this new era of great-power competition,” Rubio said in a statement, referring to US rivalry with China.\n\n“The sprawling bureaucracy created a system more beholden to radical political ideology than advancing America’s core national interests.”\n\nOne key change will be eliminating a division in charge of “civilian security, democracy and human rights”. It will be replaced by a new office of “coordination for foreign assistance and humanitarian affairs”, which will absorb functions of the US Agency for International Develop­ment — gutted at the start of the Trump administration with the elimination of more than 80 per cent of programmes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
