However, after a two-hour wait, they were told the visiting hours had expired.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Noreen Khan, sister of the former prime minister, informed PTI founder’s sister and cousin Qasim Khan were denied access. “The jail administration kept us waiting at the entrance for two hours and then told us that the time was over,” she said.\n\nPTI to write to IHC CJ over repeated violations of court orders, says Salman Akram Raja\n\nOn the other hand, PTI Secr­e­tary General Sal­man Akram Raja rejected rumours that Imran Khan had met with a US delegation in jail. “Our party was not involved in any such me­e­ting, and we do not believe in backdoor negotiations,” he said.\n\nSpeaking later at a press conference at Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House, Mr Raja said a letter would be submitted to the chief justice of the IHC on Wednesday to formally raise the issue.\n\nMr Raja criticised the authorities for failing to implement court directives. “The establishment is confused and is acting in a childish manner by violating court orders,” he told reporters.\n\nHe said Pakistan’s history has shown that such systems eventually collapse. “PTI was not allowed to campaign during the general elections, yet the people gave us a two-thirds majority,” he said.\n\nMr Raja alleged that the judicial system had collapsed following the 26th Constitutional Ame­n­dment.
