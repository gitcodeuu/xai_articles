The matter, which had previously been raised in committee, led to the adjournment of an earlier meeting in protest.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s in-camera session, the power secretary briefed the committee and confirmed that the Fesco officials involved had already apologised to both the committee and Mr Mastikhel. “I have provided the necessary briefing; now it is up to the committee to decide how to resolve the matter,” the secretary said before leaving the session.\n\nPAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan acknowledged Mr Mastikhel’s gesture of forgiveness but underscored the seriousness of the incident. “Such actions are completely unacceptable,” he said. “PAC will never compromise on the dignity of its members.”\n\nHe added that the day’s meeting was being held as a continuation of the committee’s protest. “Had Mr Mastikhel not chosen to forgive, strict action would have followed,” he said.\n\nSeparately, the PAC reviewed several audit objections against the Ministry of Railways. Railway Secretary Mazhar Zeeshan briefed the committee on several persistent challenges, including a significant budget shortfall that has left many pensioners without benefits for two years.\n\n“We’ve received Rs64 billion in allocations, but liabilities still stand at around Rs13-14bn,” he said.\n\nMr Zeeshan also updated the committee on the delayed Main Line-1 (ML-1) railway upgrade project, claiming there were “no problems from our side”. He confirmed the revised design would support train speeds of up to 160 km/h.\n\nThe PAC also flagged concerns over procurement violations amounting to over Rs3.39bn between June 2020 and June 2022, related to the repair of 100 locomotives. Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan criticised the lack of actionable outcomes from Departmental Accounts Committee (DAC) meetings and deferred further discussion.\n\nOther significant audit issues included the misappropriation of Rs506.6 million in high-speed diesel procurement and the unauthorised commercial use of land leased to Al-Shifa Eye Hospital in Sukkur. The committee ordered formal inquiries into both matters and demanded action reports, setting a 10-day deadline in the diesel case.\n\nThe committee reaffirmed its commitment to transparency and public accountability, warning that violations of public trust would not be tolerated — even in cases where members opted to forgive.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
