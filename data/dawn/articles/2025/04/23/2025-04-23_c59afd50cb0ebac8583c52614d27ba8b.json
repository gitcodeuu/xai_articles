  "content": "WASHINGTON: Astronomers have spotted a small rocky planet that orbits perilously close to its host star disintegrating as its surface is vaporised by stellar heat, trailed by a comet-like tail of mineral dust up to about 5.6 million miles (9 million km) long.\n\nAbout 5,800 planets beyond our solar system, called exoplanets, have been discovered since the 1990s. Of those, only four have been observed disintegrating in orbit, as this one is.\n\nThis planet is the closest to our solar system of the four, giving scientists a unique opportunity to learn about what happens to these doomed worlds.\n\nThe researchers observed the planet, named BD+05 4868 Ab, as it gradually crumbles into dust, shedding material roughly equal to the mass of Mount Everest with each orbit of its star. The tail of dust trailing the planet wraps halfway around the star.\n\nThe planet is estimated as between the size of our solar system’s smallest and innermost planet Mercury and Earth’s moon. It is located about 140 light years away from Earth in the constellation Pegasus. A light-year is the distance light travels in a year, 5.9 trillion miles (9.5 trillion km).\n\nIts host star, a type called an orange dwarf, is smaller, cooler and dimmer than the sun, with about 70pc of the sun’s mass and diameter and about 20pc of its luminosity. The planet orbits this star every 30.5 hours at a distance about 20 times closer than Mercury is to the sun.\n\nThe planet’s surface temperature is estimated at close to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit (about 1,600 degrees Celsius) thanks to its close proximity to its star. As a result, the planet’s surface has probably been turned to magma — molten rock.\n\n“We expect the planet to disintegrate into dust within the next million years or so,” said Marc Hon, a postdoctoral researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research and lead author of the study published on Tuesday in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n\n“This is catastrophically quick in cosmic timescales. The disintegration is a runaway process. As more material from the planet turns into dust, the disintegration process gets faster,” Hon said.\n\nOnce in space, the vaporised material cools down to form mineral dust that streams away from the planet.\n\n“We know the dust grains in the tail can have sizes between large soot particles and fine grains of sand,” Hon said. “We don’t know the mineral composition of the tail yet.” The researchers detected BD+05 4868 Ab using the “transit method,” observing a dip in the host star’s brightness when the planet passes in front of it, from the perspective of a viewer on Earth. It was found using Nasa’s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, or TESS, space telescope. How the planet came to have its current close-in orbit is unclear.\n\n“The planet’s orbit is not seen to be visibly decaying from the data. It is possible that the planet initially formed farther away, and had its original orbit altered under the influence of an external body, such that the planet was sent much closer to the star,” Hon said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
