Eventually, the Safe Cities Project will also be rolled out in Mardan, Kohat, Nowshera, Swat and Abbottabad.\n\nAn official statement issued here quoted Mr Gandapur as saying at the agreement signing ceremony that the government’s safe city flagship\n\nproject would transform the provincial capital, all divisional headquarters and other “sensitive” districts into safe cities.\n\nHe said that ensuring peace and protecting public life and property was the government’s top priority.\n\nThe chief minister also said that the police force was being strengthened and modernised.\n\n“The Safe City Project represents a key milestone,” he said, stressing the need for the use of modern technology for security purposes.\n\nMr Gandapur said that the initiative would not only enhance public safety but also boost people’s confidence in the state’s security apparatus.\n\nHe said his government was committed to improving governance and law and order through innovative and practical use of modern technology.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
