  "content": "KARACHI: Legal proceedings at subordinate judiciary across the province remained suspended on Tuesday due to the boycott of courts by lawyers protesting against the controversial canals project.\n\nThe courts in Karachi, Hyderabad, Dadu, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sanghar, Naushahro Feroze and other districts wore a deserted look throughout the day due to the lawyers’ boycott.\n\nHowever, hearing of cases at the Sindh High Court remained unaffected.\n\nLawyers held rallies in their respective cities and towns to express solidarity with their colleagues holding a prolonged sit-in at Babarloi Bypass against the controversial canals project.\n\nIn Karachi, the legal fraternity observed a full-day strike and closed the doors of district courts for an indefinite period.\n\nAll Sindh Lawyers Action Committee decides to extend Khairpur sit-in to Kamo Shaheed, Kashmore Dera Mor and Karachi\n\nIn a statement, KBA acting general secretary Imran Aziz announced that the boycott of judicial proceedings will continue for an indefinite period in solidarity with the protesters at the Babarloi bypass.\n\nHe stated that during this period only lawyers would be allowed to enter the City Courts premises.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, Mr Aziz said that a widely attended meeting of the All Sindh Lawyers Action Committee had resolved that the ongoing sit-in at the Babarloi Bypass would be extended to additional three locations — Kamo Shaheed, Kashmore Dera Mor and Karachi.\n\n“This protest is a continuation of the struggle to oppose the construction of six canals on the River Indus, and unconstitutional corporate farming,” he said.\n\nMr Aziz reiterated their stance that the association stood firm in its commitment to the cause and declared that there would be no compromise until the illegal acts and schemes threatening the rights, land and water of Sindh were completely revoked.\n\nHe also announced that a sit-in would be held outside the Malir court; however, he later informed the journalists that the protest location had been changed to Bin Qasim Link Road in Gulshan-i-Hadeed.\n\nHe urged members of the legal fraternity and civil society to join this “historic movement in defence of River Indus” and the future of Sindh.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
