  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistani politicians on Tuesday demanded the Iranian government to expedite the process of unveiling and prosecuting perpetrators behind the killing of eight Pakistani labourers in Sistan province on April 12.\n\nThey also called for enhancing protection for migrant workers.\n\nAccording to a press release, the demands were presented during a meeting at the Iranian embassy between former federal minister Mohammad Ali Durrani, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister’s Adviser Barrister Dr Mohammad Ali Saif and Iranian Ambassador Dr Reza Amiri Moghaddam.\n\nMr Durrani, highlighting his personal connection as a native of Bahawalpur where the victims’ families reside, said: “The bereaved families demand not just arrests but public identification of those behind this gruesome crime.”\n\n“These workers represented Pakistan’s most vulnerable economic class. Their tragic deaths have pushed already struggling families into deeper despair, Durrani said, and called for immediate Iranian measures to secure Pakistani labour communities.\n\nBarrister Saif conveyed the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government’s commitment to support Iran’s counter-terrorism efforts and strengthen people-to-people ties.\n\nThe Iranian ambassador accepted the invitation of visiting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa extended by the visitors.\n\nAmbassador Moghaddam offered condolences, saying: “Iran shared your grief and assured transparent legal proceedings.” He reassured Tehran’s commitment to protecting all foreign workers.\n\nThe ambassador said the security forces of Iran would hunt down the perpetrators behind this heinous crime, and their identities would be revealed to the public.\n\nHe also emphasised the need to increase bilateral trade between the two countries from $3 billion to $10 billion.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 23rd, 2025",
