He said that the public must not lose hope, and they should protect their children’s future by ensuring vaccination. He affirmed that the anti-polio campaign will continue with determination.\n\nBalochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind also condemned the incident saying that “a thorough investigation into the incident was under way”.\n\n“The provincial government will not allow the polio campaign to be sabotaged under any circumstances,” he continued.\n\n“We pay tribute to the martyrs who are responsible for security. We are proud of their sacrifices,” he added. He further said that the security for polio teams across the province was being improved with more effective measures.\n\nPM Shehbaz on Sunday launched this year’s second nationwide anti-polio campaign, running from April 21 to April 27, and vowed to achieve “roaring success” in the effort.\n\nEarlier this week, terrorists attacked the station house officer and police team who were on polio duty in the Kalosha area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s South Waziristan.",
