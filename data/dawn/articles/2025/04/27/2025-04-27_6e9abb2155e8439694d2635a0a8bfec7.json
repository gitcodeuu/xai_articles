He also said the US and Ukraine would eventually reach an agreement over rare earth minerals and that talks continued over the weekend.\n\nDemocrats in the US Congress have criticised Trump’s approach to the conflict and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on Sunday that he was concerned Trump would “cave in to Putin”.\n\n“To just abandon Ukraine, after all the sacrifice that they made, after so much loss of life, and with the rallying of the whole West against Putin, it would just be a moral tragedy,” Schumer said on CNN’s ‘State of the Union’.\n\nSchumer said siding with Russia in the conflict would tear apart alliances with Europe and embolden dictators around the world.",
