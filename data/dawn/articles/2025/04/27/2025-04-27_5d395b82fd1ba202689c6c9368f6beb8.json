Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).\n\nSince the incident, the nuclear-armed nations have unleashed a raft of measures against each other, with India unilaterally suspending the critical Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) and Pakistan retaliating by threatening to put the Simla Agreement in abeyance and closing its airspace for Indian flights.\n\nIndia has implied cross-border linkages of the attackers, while Pakistan strongly denied any involvement.\n\nAccording to the report, PM Shehbaz reiterated his official invitation to the Iranian president and welcomed Iran’s readiness to help ease tensions.\n\nThe premier also emphasised that Pakistan sought peace in the region and that if Iran wishes to play a role in this regard, Islamabad would welcome it.\n\n“Pakistan condemns all forms of terrorism and has no connection to the recent terrorist attack in Pahalgam, located in the India-held Kashmir region,” the statement read.\n\nMoreover, the prime minister also repeated that Pakistan is ready to “participate in a transparent and unbiased investigation into the terrorist attack”, saying that the country has been one of the greatest victims of terrorism over the past two decades, with thousands of its citizens losing their lives and the government spending billions of dollars to combat this menace.\n\nRegarding India’s decision on the Indus Waters Treaty with Pakistan, he said that weaponising water was “unacceptable and that Islamabad will defend itself at any cost”.\n\nThe agency also reported the prime minister “expressed solidarity with the Iranian government and people following the powerful explosion at Shahid Rajaee port, saying Islamabad is ready to assist Tehran in addressing this incident”.\n\nIran’s President Pezeshkian, for his part, thanked the premier “for his solidarity regarding the incident at Shahid Rajaee port” and praised Pakistan’s efforts for “peace in the region”.\n\n“The Iranian president invited the Pakistani prime minister to visit Tehran, and in return, Sharif renewed his invitation to Pezeshkian to visit Islamabad,” the report read.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Sunday spoke with his Chinese counterpart and member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, Wang Yi, according to a statement issued by the Foreign Office.\n\nBriefing the Chinese minister on the current regional situation, Dar “categorically rejected India’s unilateral and illegal actions, as well as its baseless propaganda against Pakistan”.\n\nExpressing deep appreciation for China’s consistent and unwavering support, Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s “strong commitment to the iron-clad friendship” between the two countries and the “shared vision of an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership”.\n\n“He emphasised Pakistan’s determination to further deepen bilateral cooperation across all spheres,” the statement read.\n\nIt added that both sides “reiterated their firm resolve to uphold regional peace and stability, promote mutual respect and understanding, and jointly oppose unilateralism and hegemonic policies”.\n\n“They agreed to maintain close communication and coordination at all levels to advance their shared objectives of peace, security, and sustainable development in the region and beyond.”\n\nPakistan Kissan Ittehad President Khalid Mahmood Khokhar reaffirmed support for the country’s armed forces saying that farmers are ready to stand at the border if needed, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\nAddressing a press conference today, Khokhar said, “The civil society and farmers across the country stand united with the armed forces and are ready to give a befitting reply to Indian aggression.”\n\nVowing to defend Pakistan at all costs, he was quoted as saying, “Every farmer is a soldier. We are ready to fight with our sickles and weapons for our country.”\n\nHe warned that farmers will “demolish” Indian dams in case New Delhi tried to block Pakistan’s water.",
