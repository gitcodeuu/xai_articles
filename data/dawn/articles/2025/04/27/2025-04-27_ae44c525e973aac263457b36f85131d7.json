Thari rejected state-led programs like the Green Pakistan Initiative and bodies like the SIFC, labeling them anti-people and detrimental to Pakistan’s agricultural and democratic future.\n\nLawyers’ protest in Kandhkot continues\n\nThe Lawyers’ Alliance and the All Parties Movement continued their sit-in at Goala More (turning) on the Indus Highway in Kandhkot on the sixth consecutive day against the controversial canals.\n\nSindh United Party president Syed Zain Shah also joined the sit-in after reaching there in a convoy and said the sit-in had brought to a halt vehicular movement to Punjab.

Shah and then reached Dadu where Sheikh said that if the construction of canals was not stopped, Indus would become dry as Sindh was already receiving its share of water.\n\nHe warned that it would aggravate water crisis in Sindh and Karachi will not receive a single drop of water.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 27th, 2025",
