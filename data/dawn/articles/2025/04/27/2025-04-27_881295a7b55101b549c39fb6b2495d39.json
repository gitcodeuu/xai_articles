All these discussions were dominated by the Pahalgam attack.\n\nTensions between the two countries soared in the aftermath of the attack as India took a series of harsh measures, including suspending the Indus Water Treaty, downgrading diplomatic relatio­­ns, revoking visas for Pakistani na­­­tionals — including those und­er the South Asian Associa­tion for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) visa exemption scheme — and halting bilateral trade. Security measures were also heightened.\n\nPakistan mirrored India’s steps and went further by banning Ind­ian airliners from using its airspa­­ce and warning it could suspend all bilateral agreements, including the landmark Simla Agree­ment, which underpins rela­­tions between the two countries.\n\nWhile India has stopped short of directly blaming Pakistan, officials have hinted at cross-border involvement, a claim Islamabad has firmly denied.\n\nUNSC slams attack\n\nThe UN Security Council also condemned the “terrorist” attack in the Indian occupied Kashmir, as the 15-member body also released Pakistan’s statement outlining its retaliatory countermeasures to New Delhi’s “reckless” steps announced in the wake of the April 22 incident.\n\nIn a press statement cited by the state-run APP, the council members called for accountability and international cooperation to bring the perpetrators of the Pahalgam attack to justice.\n\nThey expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims, as well as to the governments of India and Nepal, extending wishes for a speedy recovery to those injured in the attack.\n\nTerrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security, the council members reaffirmed. They underscored that such acts are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomever committed.\n\nThe council members urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with all relevant authorities.\n\nThey reaffirmed the need for states to combat by all means threats to international peace and security resulting from acts of terrorism, in accordance with the UN Cha­rter and other obligations under international law.\n\nMeanwhile, the UN Security Council released the press statement issued at the conclusion of Pakistan’s National Security Committee meeting, which was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday, as an official document. The Pakistani statement contained the retaliatory decisions taken during the NSC’s deliberations.\n\nIn a letter, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad transmitted the statement to the UN Security Council President for April, Jerome Bonnafont of France, on Friday.\n\n“The letter has been issued as an official document of the Security Council under the agenda item ‘India-Pakistan Qu­­estion’,” the council president told the members.\n\nSeparately, a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the UN chief was paying “very close attention” to the escalating tensions between India and Pakistan.\n\n“I don’t agree with your comment, (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation bet­ween India and Pakistan,” Spok­esperson Stephane Duja­rric told a New York Post reporter at the regular noon briefing at UN Hea­dquarters in New York.\n\nFollowing a question from APP whether the UN chief planned to speak to the leaders of India and Pakistan on his return from Rome, Mr Dujarric said that he hoped to have something on it later. At this, the Post reporter commented, “Amazing, by the way, two nuclear countries … might go to war may merit such little attention…?” “I don’t agree with your comment (but) we are paying very close attention to the situation between India and Pakistan,” Mr Dujarric responded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 27th, 2025",
