  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Two threatening calls made to two upscale hotels situated within Islamabad’s heavily-fortified Red Zone have been traced to an international number associated with a neighbouring eastern country, Dawn has learnt.\n\nAccording to police sources, both the calls were placed from the same number (+009*099*****82) directly to the hotels earlier this week. The caller warned hotel staff about the alleged presence of a vehicle laden with explosives on the premises.\n\nIn the first call, the caller informed the hotel staff that an explosive-laden vehicle bearing registration number B**-7** had been parked in the hotel’s parking area.\n\nThe police were informed about the threat and in response a contingent of officials, including from the Counter-Terrorism Department and Bomb Disposal Squad, rushed to the hotel. Precautionary measures were put in place in the area and adjacent localities which were also vacated.\n\nLater, the Bomb Disposal Squad and police searched for the vehicle bearing such a number, but none was found there. Three other vehicles parked there were thoroughly scanned and checked.\n\nThe officials also searched adjacent localities and scanned them, but no explosive material or suspicious item was detected.\n\nMeanwhile, a second call was received at another hotel in the Red Zone from the same number, when the police and the Bomb Disposal teams were busy scanning the first hotel. This time, the caller gave the same threat to the hotel staff saying that an explosive had been planted in a vehicle bearing registration number 4**5, and parked in the parking area of the hotel.\n\nSeparate police teams, including from the Bomb Disposal Squad, were dispatched to the hotel. They conducted a thorough search but found no vehicle bearing the given registration number. A full-scale search of the entire parking facility was initiated and later the area was declared clear. Both the incidents are being taken seriously, and further investigation into the origin and intent of the caller is being conducted, an officer said.\n\nIt may be mentioned that foreign and local players, technical and broadcasting staff and crew are staying in one of the hotels in connection with the ongoing Pakistan Super League. Earlier, in 2021, the visiting New Zealand cricket team called off its tour of Pakistan citing security concerns after receiving threatening calls.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 27th, 2025",
