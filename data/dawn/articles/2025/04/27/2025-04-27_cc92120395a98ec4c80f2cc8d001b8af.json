  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In Pakistan, where awareness remains limited and diagnostic capacity critically low, the burden of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is growing. There are fewer than 100 trained consultants across the country capable of accurately diagnosing autism — a gap that severely delays early intervention, which is often critical before the age of five.\n\nThese views were expressed by Maroof International Hospital Chief Executive Officer Haroon Naseer during an event held to highlight ASD.\n\nHe said that according to global estimates, 1 in 100 children is diagnosed with ASD.\n\nWhile World Autism Awareness Month is set to conclude in the upcoming week, free autism diagnostic consultations are being provided to diagnose autism spectrum disorder (ASD), he said.\n\n“The free autism diagnostic consultations were led by Professor S Hashim Raza, Consultant at East Surrey National Health Services Trust, UK, and one of only two certified specialists in Pakistan qualified to diagnose ASD,” he said, adding that Dr Raza was assisted by Ms Tehreem Khan.\n\nTheir team provided guidance to dozens of parents on identifying early signs and supporting developmental needs.\n\nCoordinator of the Maroof International Hospital, Ms Rubina Afzal, said that ASD is a developmental disability caused by differences in the brain.\n\n“ASD begins around the age of three and lasts throughout a person’s life, although symptoms may improve over time. Studies have shown that one-third of parents of children with ASD noticed a problem before their child’s first birthday, and others saw problems by 24 months of age,” she said. Some children with ASD seem to develop normally until around 18 to 24 months of age and then stop gaining new skills or lose the skills they once had,” she added.\n\nAccording to the Autism Society of Pakistan, there is no reliable data to estimate the occurrence of autism in Pakistan, but some estimates suggest there are around 350,000 children with autism in the country.\n\nThey are not easily identifiable as it is not a physical disease that can be diagnosed through simple tests.\n\nIn the USA, however, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that approximately 1 in 59 children is diagnosed with ASD.\n\nThe experts said, therefore, Pakistan should also treat this as a matter of serious concern.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 27th, 2025",
