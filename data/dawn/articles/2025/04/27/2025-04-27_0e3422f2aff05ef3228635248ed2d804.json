  "content": "LAHORE: The Ministry of Commerce has raised concerns over decline in maize exports and directed the Department of Plant Protection (DPP) and others concerned to take immediate export facilitative interventions to help instant resumption of maize exports.\n\nIn a letter, the ministry invites attention of the Ministry of National Food Security and Research (MNFSR) about the significant decline in Pakistan’s maize exports to several key international markets, including Vietnam, Saudi Arabia, France, China, Somalia, and Madagascar, during the current fiscal year as compared to the previous year.\n\nIn particular, the ministry considers complete cessation of exports to Vietnam since September 2024, which was Pakistan’s largest maize export destination last year (exports valued at $211 million), a matter of serious concern. “It has been observed as well as reported by maize exporters, REAP and Pakistan’s Trade and Investment Officer in Hanoi that the primary reason for the abrupt decline of exports to Vietnam is the self-imposed restriction on maize exports by the Department of Plant Protection (DPP), following the detection of Trogoderma granarium (khapra beetle) in some consignments bound for Vietnam in July 2024,” explains the ministry in its letter.\n\nIt also shared the data related to maize exports to Vietnam that revealed $26.81m, $7.73m and $0.23m in July, August and September, respectively, and zero exports onward in the ongoing fiscal year started from July 1, last year and says that the ministry fully recognises the importance of complying with international phytosanitary requirements. And it has been consistently advocating balancing our regulatory efforts of SPS compliance with export facilitation.\n\nShows concern over 87pc plunge despite exportable surplus\n\n“Exports are, after all, of paramount importance to Pakistan’s economy, promotion of which is the prime objective of the government. However, it has been noted that despite understanding of MOC and MNFSR at higher levels to avoid blanket bans and to instead adopt corrective measures for SPS compliance for exports to Vietnam in July 2024, the process of taking remedial actions by DPP in this regard has been considerably delayed. As a result, it is understood that essential export procedures by DPP for export to Vietnam remained suspended for several months and hence no export permits were issued for maize exporters to Vietnam, which effectively has stalled millions of dollars worth of corn exports to one of the largest export destinations,” the letter says.\n\nIronically, it said, when the Ministry of Commerce raised the issue of zero maize exports to Vietnam with DPP on March 19, 2025, the DPP in response, quickly and without consultation with stakeholders issued a set of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) on March 26 for corn exports. However, by then significant damage to the continuity of exports had already been done. The DPP, however, did not provide any reason for cessation of granting export permits to corn exports to Vietnam and its self-imposed ban on exports.\n\nAdditionally, certain provisions in the SOPs require clarifications. Notably, Clauses 9 and 14 of the SOPs appear to suggest mandatory double fumigation with methyl bromide (MB), which contradict the decision taken during the 62nd meeting of the Agricultural Pesticides Technical Advisory Committee (APTAC), which states that: “Duplicate MB treatment must be avoided for consignments already fumigated and found free from quarantine pests.”\n\nIt apprises the MNSFR that the requirement for dedicated maize storage warehouses, as prescribed in the SOPs, will cause significant operational and financial challenges for the exporters, especially SMEs, thereby impeding export facilitation rather than supporting it.\n\nIt also worries about the matter being highlighted in print as well as social media wherein it has been highlighted that Pakistan despite having exportable surplus of maize has still witnessed an export plunge of 87 per cent in the past few months.\n\n“The ministry requests the DPP to receive the considered views and feedback of MNFSR on the matter with further request for possible revisions of the SOPs in consultations with exporters and other stakeholders and to take immediate export facilitative interventions to help instant resumption of maize exports to Vietnam and other important markets in line with international phytosanitary standards,” the letter says.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 27th, 2025",
