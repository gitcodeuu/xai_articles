  "content": "XIAMEN: Karsten Warholm broke the men’s 300m hurdles world record at the opening Diamond League meeting of the season in Xiamen on Saturday, but Olympic 110m hurdles champion Grant Holloway suffered a shock defeat.\n\nThe 29-year-old Norwegian 400m hurdles world record holder crossed the finish line in a blistering 33.05 seconds, taking 0.21 seconds off his own mark set four years ago in the little-run event.\n\n“I thought it was a very good race and a little bit surprised over how easy my legs were feeling out the last bend,” said Warholm, who won gold in the 400m hurdles at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and silver in Paris last year.\n\n“This is a very good test for speed and hurdles so it is a very good first race for me,” he said. “I am looking to win as much as I can.”\n\nUS sprint hurdles star Holloway finished last after leading for much of his race but losing momentum disastrously after the eighth hurdle.\n\nThe three-time world champion trailed across the line in 13.72sec, way behind fellow American Cordell Tinch, who won in 13.06.\n\nFaith Kipyegon came within 0.23sec of breaking a decades-old world record in the women’s 1000m, finishing in 2min 29.21sec.\n\n“It went how I wanted just to start my season in a good way,” said the Kenyan. “I wanted to do my personal best which was very close to the world record.”\n\nSwedish superstar Armand “Mondo” Duplantis won the pole vault comfortably with a jump of 5.92m, but failed with three attempts at 6.01 in a performance that never threatened his world record of 6.27 set in February.\n\nYaroslava Mahuchikh from Ukraine, the Olympic and world champion, won the high jump after clearing 1.97m on her first attempt.\n\nZhang Mingkun had the home fans cheering as he took China’s only victory of the night in the men’s long jump, but he left it late with his leap of 8.18m on his fifth attempt that proved just enough to beat Australia’s Liam Adcock (8.15).\n\nKenya’s Beatrice Chebet edged world record holder Gudaf Tsegay of Ethiopia to win the women’s 5000m, finishing in 14:27.12.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 27th, 2025",
