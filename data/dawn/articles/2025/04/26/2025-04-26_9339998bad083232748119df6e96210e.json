  "content": "RAWALPINDI: On the call of Young Doctors Association (YDA) Punjab, the young doctors on Friday boycotted the Outdoor Patients Departments (OPD) of three government-run hospitals of the garrison city against Punjab government’s plan to outsource public sector hospitals in the province.\n\nThe OPDs remained closed on Friday, and it left the patients unattended. However, the hospital administration referred all the patients to the emergency department, which created mess there.\n\nThough Friday was a half-working day and the absence of doctors forced many patients to return empty-handed.\n\nOn the other hand, a grand convention and protest walk were organised by YDA BBH against the proposed outsourcing of Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH). YDA office bearers, house officers, postgraduates, nursing staff, paramedics, and staff from other departments participated in this gathering.\n\nThe convention was led by YDA BBH President Dr Aarif Aziz. He was accompanied by Chairman Dr Fakhar Munir Sial, Vice President Dr Muhammad Raees, and General Secretary Dr Muhammad Rizwanullah.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr Arif Aziz said: “This is not just a protest but a war of survival. Outsourcing means taking away free treatment from the people, selling education, and economic murder of employees. We will not accept this policy under any circumstances.”\n\nRepresentatives from all sectors in the convention unanimously raised their voices against the outsourcing and expressed their readiness for strict measures in the future.\n\nThe rally passed through various departments of the hospital and ended at the main ground, where all participants expressed their commitment to unity, perseverance, and peaceful struggle.\n\nYDA BBH clarifies that if the government does not withdraw the decision, the intensity of the protests will increase across the province, and a full strike may also be announced in the next phase.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
