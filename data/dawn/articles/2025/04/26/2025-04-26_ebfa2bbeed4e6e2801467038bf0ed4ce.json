A police officer said soldiers also destroyed Tho­kar’s family home in the neighbouring Bijbe­hara area in a similar manner, early on Friday.\n\nPolice claimed they were part of the hitherto unknown group, referred to by Indian media as ‘The Resistance Front’ (TRF).\n\n“Both have been active for three to four years, and are part of TRF,” a police intelligence officer told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity, because they were not authorised to speak to the media.\n\n“They are wanted militants involved in earlier attacks as well on security forces,” the officer added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
