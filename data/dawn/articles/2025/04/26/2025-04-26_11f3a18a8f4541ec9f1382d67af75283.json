  "content": "LAHORE: Up until the 11th over, Karachi Kings were cruising; run-a-ball needed, eight wickets in hand, all set to consolidate their number-two spot in the HBL Pakistan Super League standings.\n\nQuetta Gladiators — placed fifth — meanwhile, stayed in the hunt for a breakthrough. And when it finally came in the form of high-flying opener Tim Siefert’s miscued a heave off pacer Mohammad Wasim caught by Rilee Rossouw at long-on in the 12th over, Gladiators ensured the Kings did not breathe again.\n\nThe next five wickets fell in the space of 33 balls, as Quetta stole the match by five runs for only their second victory this season here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday night.\n\nFollowing Seifert’s ouster Shan Masood was the next to follow, with wicket-keeper Kusal Mendis taking a flying catch off Khurram Shahzad’s bowling in the next over before a Quetta skipper Saud Shakeel’s brilliant decision to place himself at first slip for Abrar Ahmed’s leg-spin saw him take a simple catch to dismiss Khushdil Shah..\n\nAbrar could have gone on to take yet another wicket on the very next ball had Wasim had held on to the ball after a diving attempt to take a catch off Mohammad Nabi’s drive. But the Afghan veteran didn’t stay on for too long, as Amir returned in the 16th to get him out.\n\nKhurram returned in the 17th to see a DRS ruling confirm Abbas Afridi’s lbw dismissal and Wasim took his second by trapping Omair Bin Yousuf before Faheem Ashraf’s brilliant final over restricted Kings to 137-8 in pursuit of 142 – the lowest ever score defended in the PSL at the venue.\n\nKings start to the chase was decent despite veteran pacer Mohammad Amir striking in the first over to dismiss Kings captain and opener David Warner.\n\nSeifert and James Vince hit Kings’ first two sixes off Khurram and Amir in the following couple of overs. Seifert drove Khurram for three more boundaries in the fourth over to put Kings in the driving seat.\n\nVince smacked Wasim through the on-side and sliced the pacer through square as Kings crossed 50 in the powerplay Seifert cleared long-off and clobbered Faheem through the same region for a boundary in the eighth over. However, he saw Vince perish off Saud’s left-arm spin in the next over as Kings reached 82-2 at the halfway stage before Siefert’s wicket triggered a collapse..\n\nEarlier, Gladiators were bundled out for 142 in 19.3 overs in a topsy-turvy first innings as Faheem’s explosive 43 off 27 balls, including four fours and three sixes, propped up the total after early collapses and a shaky middle-order show.\n\nOpener Saud kicked off proceedings with a stylish four off Mir Hamza’s opening delivery, but Hasan Ali’s (3-33) fiery second over turned the tide.\n\nHe dismissed openers Saud and Finn Allen in quick succession, leaving Quetta at 8-2. Rossouw (10) briefly counterattacked with two boundaries, only to fall to Hasan, dragging one onto his stumps at 29-3 by the fourth over.\n\nMendis (36 off 22) provided stability, stroking five boundaries, including a deft late cut and a flicked four. However, Nabi’s arm ball accounted for Mark Chapman), reducing Quetta to 45-4 after six overs. Mendis and Hasan Nawaz (35 off 34) added 24 runs, but Mendis’ aggressive knock ended when he miscued Abbas Afridi to James Vince at long-on, leaving Quetta at 69-5.\n\nFaheem’s arrival injected momentum. He and Hasan Nawaz added 59 for the sixth wicket, with Faheem smashing a six and a four off Hasan in a 19-run 15th over.\n\nHis flicked six off Abbas further boosted Quetta past 100. Hassan Nawaz’s gritty stand ended when he holed out to Vince off pacer Fawad Ali, and Hamza’s wicket-maiden 18th over saw Wasim cleaned up by a perfect yorker and Amir caught by Warner.\n\nFaheem’s valiant effort was halted by a stunning one-handed catch from wicket-keeper Seifert off Abbas, and Khurram’s run-out, via Hasan’s direct hit, wrapped up the innings with a total good enough for them to win at the end.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nQUETTA GLADIATORS:\n\nSaud Shakeel c Shan b Hasan 6\n\nFinn Allen c Abbas b Hasan 0\n\nRilee Rossouw b Hasan 10\n\nKusal Mendis c Vince b Abbas 36\n\nMark Chapman b Nabi 4\n\nHasan Nawaz c Vince b Fawad 35\n\nFaheem Ashraf c Seifert b Abbas 43\n\nMohammad Wasim b Hamza 1\n\nMohammad Amir c Warner b Hamza 0\n\nKhurram Shahzad run out 1\n\nAbrar Ahmed not out 2\n\nEXTRAS (LB-2, NB-1, W-1) 4\n\nTOTAL (all out, 19.3 overs) 142\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-7 (Saud), 2-8 (Allen), 3-20 (Rossouw), 4-44 (Chapman), 5-69 (Mendis), 6-128 (Hasan), 7-131 (Wasim), 8-131 (Amir), 9-139 (Faheem)\n\nBOWLING: Hamza 4-1-24-2, Hasan 3.3-0-33-3 (1w), Nabi 4-0-21-1, Khushdil 1-0-12-0, Fawad 3-0-19-1 (1nb), Abbas 4-0-31-2\n\nKARACHI KINGS:\n\nDavid Warner c Rossouw b Amir 4\n\nTim Seifert c Rossouw b Wasim 47\n\nJames Vince c Rossouw b Saud 30\n\nShan Masood c Mendis b Khurram 9\n\nOmair Bin Yousuf lbw b Wasim 11\n\nKhushdil Shah c Saud b Abrar 0\n\nMohammad Nabi c Khurram b Amir 4\n\nAbbas Afridi lbw b Khurram 0\n\nHasan Ali not out 24\n\nMir Hamza not out 3\n\nEXTRAS (LB-3, NB-1, W-1) 5\n\nTOTAL (for eight wickets, 20 overs) 137\n\nDID NOT BAT: Fawad Ali\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-4 (Warner), 2-77 (Vince), 3-93 (Seifert), 4-96 (Shan), 5-97 (Khushdil), 6-102 (Nabi), 7-107 (Abbas), 8-115 (Omair)\n\nBOWLING: Amir 4-0-25-2 (1w), Khurram 4-0-31-2, Abrar 4-0-15-1, Wasim 4-0-22-2, Faheem 2-0-30-0 (1nb), Saud 2-0-10-1\n\nRESULT: Quetta Gladiators won by five runs.\n\nPLAYER-OF-THE-MATCH: Faheem Ashraf\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
