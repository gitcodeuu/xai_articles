At the time of going to press, no official statement had been issued to confirm whether the demonstrations would be called off or not.\n\nOn Thursday, prior to the settlement between the government and PPP, goods carriers, in a press conference held at the Karachi Press Club, said in case the stranded vehicles were not given safe passage by noon on April 25, 2025, they would park all their vehicles, which are currently on the roadsides, in middle of the road and announce a strike.\n\nMeanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has urged demonstrators to open blocked highways and allow goods movement to resume.\n\n“Peaceful protests are acceptable, but public disruptions are not,” Mr Shah said. “Given India’s hostile actions, we must stand united rather than fall into divisive politics.”\n\nThe blockade has alarmed industry leaders who say the economy is already bearing the brunt of the prolonged unrest.\n\nJawed Bilwani, president of the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry, estimated cumulative losses of over Rs500 billion ($1.8 billion) in export orders and local production over the past 10 to 12 days. This includes four days of transport delays due to a separate strike by truckers protesting new fitness certificate regulations.\n\n“Many sacrificial animals have died en route. Textile exporters are unable to meet deadlines, and raw materials are stuck in transit,” Mr Bilwani said.\n\n“This crisis is hurting Pakistan’s image among international buyers and may result in the shifting of orders to other countries.”\n\nParties wary\n\nNot just lawyers, but other political parties are also wary of the PM’s announcement regarding the canals project, and therefore unwilling to call off their strike just yet.\n\nRashid Mehmood Soomro, general secretary of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) Sindh, rejected the federal government’s verbal assurances.\n\n“Without official written cancellation of the canal project, the nation will not be satisfied,” the JUI-F leader said. “Our sit-ins and resistance will continue.”\n\nAdvocate Vasand Thari, central president of Awami Tehreek, criticised the PPP for referring the matter to the eight-member CCI, where Punjab holds more weight.\n\n“The PPP is betraying Sindh by backing Punjab’s interests,” Mr Thari said. “We reject this deception and will continue our peaceful democratic struggle.”\n\nFormer Grand Dem­ocratic Alliance lawmaker Moazzim Abbasi dismissed the government’s pause as “a lollipop,” and said the protests would persist until a formal cancellation notification is issued.\n\nM.B.
