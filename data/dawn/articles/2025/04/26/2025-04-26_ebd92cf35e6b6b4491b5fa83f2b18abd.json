We are the heirs of this river, and we will protect it.”\n\n“We have convinced the federal government about the canal issue, and now we will talk to you as well,” he said while referring to the Indian government.\n\n“Every Pakistani will become an ambassador of the Indus and send this message to the world that the theft of Indus [water] is unacceptable,” he declared.\n\nThe PPP chairman said that people of the country and all four provinces stood firmly with the Pakistan army. “Insha’Allah, we will all together give a befitting response to Modi,” he said.\n\n“I want to assure the prime minister that we stand shoulder to shoulder with him regarding India’s decision on the Indus. We will become the voice of Pakistan, the voice of the federation, and we will not allow anyone to steal Pakistan’s rights,” he said.\n\nAddressing the audience, he said: “Through peaceful struggle, you have ended the canal project. Now, together, we will foil all Modi’s attempts.”\n\nHe said that the struggle would continue until India revoked its decision to suspend Indus Waters Treaty.\n\n‘No canals without consensus’\n\nCongratulating workers of his party for the successful struggle against the controversial canals project, Mr Bhutto-Zardari said: “I congratulate you all that the purpose for which PPP workers were protesting, from streets to the National Assembly and the Senate of Pakistan, has been achieved.”\n\n“I met with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif yesterday. An agreement signed by the leaders of the PPP and PML-N has been reached and it has been decided that it is the policy of the Government of Pakistan that no new canal will be built without your consent,” he told the audience.\n\n“This is your victory. This would not have been possible if the PPP workers had not been in the field. The federal government has decided that no new canal will be built from the Indus River until there is mutual agreement in the CCI meeting,” he added.\n\n“Today, we are grateful to the prime minister for listening to the sentiments of the people,” he said.\n\nReferring to the signed agreement, the PPP chairman announced that the PM and the federal government acknowledged that they would work together with all provincial governments on water shortage issues.\n\n“In this agreement, the federal government and the prime minister have acknowledged that neither the Water Accord nor the 2018 agreement will be violated, and no canal will be built,” he added. “This is the power of the people of Sindh. Today, this project has been forced to end.”\n\nHe said that it was agreed that any project that is not in the interest of the people will be terminated. “No project will be built until there is mutual agreement. In the [CCI] meeting on May 2, Insha’Allah, we will end this project.”\n\n“We promised that we would save the Indus; this is your victory,” he said.\n\nHe also announced that the PPP would organise a public meeting in Mirpurkhas on May 1.\n\nEarlier, PPP-Sindh president Nisar Khuhro, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and other senior leaders also spoke.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
