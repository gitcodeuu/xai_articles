  "content": "DEFENCE Minister Khawaja Asif has warned that any Indian attack on Pakistan could trigger “all-out war” between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, as tensions escalate following the recent deadly assault in India-held Kashmir.\n\nIn an interview with Sky News, Mr Asif said, “If there is an all-out attack or something like that, then obviously there will be an all-out war,” adding that the world should be “worried” by the prospect of a full-scale military conflict in the region.\n\nThe warning comes after at least 26 people were killed and several others injured in the Pahalgam terror attack in the India-held Kashmir earlier this week. Responsibility for the attack was allegedly claimed by the hitherto unknown The Resistance Front (TRF).\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi vowed to “identify, track and punish” the perpetrators and their backers.\n\nMr Asif dismissed the allegations of Pakistani involvement as unfounded and part of a familiar pattern. “The reaction that came from Delhi was not surprising for us, we could make out that this whole thing was staged to create some sort of crisis in the region, particularly for us,” he said.\n\nSays reaction from New Delhi ‘not surprising’; terms Pahalgam attack ‘staged’\n\nHe questioned the legitimacy of TRF, stating, “Our government has condemned it categorically. Pakistan has been the victim of terrorism for decades. But this sort of pattern is going on in India. This time again, the people who are being accused are not known. Never heard of that organisation.”\n\nAddressing accusations from the United States and other countries, Mr Asif said, “It’s very convenient for big powers to blame Pakistan for whatever is happening in the region.” He reiterated Islamabad’s condemnation of terrorism “in all its forms”.\n\nChallenged about Lashkar-i-Taiba’s alleged links to the attack, the minister argued that the group is now defunct. “Lashkar-i-Taiba is a name from the past. It is defunct. It does not exist,” he said, asking, “When the parent organisation does not exist, how can the offshoot take birth?”\n\nMr Asif also pointed to past incidents, labelling the 2019 Pulwama and Balakot events as “false flag operations” by India, intended to justify aggressive postures towards Pakistan.\n\n“This has happened before, also, Pulwama. It was a false-flag operation. We have never heard of the organisation behind this attack. If India attacks us, we will retaliate in kind,” he warned.\n\nWhen asked about Pakistan’s alleged historic support for militant groups, Mr Asif acknowledged the country’s past involvement but pointedly shifted responsibility towards Western nations. “We have been doing this dirty work for the United States for decades, you know, and the West, including Britain,” he said.\n\nWith these remarks, the minister apparently sought to highlight how Pakistan’s role was shaped by Cold War alliances and Western strategic interests, arguing that it was at the behest of major powers that such groups were supported and funded.\n\nIndian media outlets, however, seized on the “dirty work” phrase as an admission of state-sponsored militancy, something Mr Asif categorically rejected.\n\nEmphasising Pakistan’s preparedness, Mr Asif stated, “We have already prepared for any attack from India.” However, he also expressed hope that hostilities could be averted through dialogue, saying the dispute should be resolved through negotiations rather than confrontation.\n\nMr Asif also reminded the interviewer of Mr Modi’s controversial past, citing his role in the Gujarat riots.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
