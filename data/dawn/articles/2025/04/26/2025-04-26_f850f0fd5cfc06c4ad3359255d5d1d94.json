  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI has called for the immediate release of its jailed founder, Imran Khan, vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and other leaders.\n\nThe party passed a resolution on its 29th foundation day condemning the “illegal imprisonment” of all leaders, including Mr Khan and Mr Qureshi.\n\nThe party also claimed it had won the 2024 elections, but its mandate was “stolen through rigging”.\n\n“We also demand [the] restoration of our legitimate mandate,” the PTI resolution said.\n\nThe party called for the restoration of free media and human rights. It called for repealing the 26th Amendment.\n\nIn a statement, Leader of the Opposition in Nat­io­nal Assembly Omar Ayub said Mr Khan was “illegally imprisoned” while his family was barred from meeting him.\n\nSpeaking at an event to mark the 29th foundation day, former NA speaker Asad Qaiser expressed grave concerns over the state of the judiciary, saying people’s trust in the judicial system eroded in the past few years.\n\nHe said the judicial system was ‘paralysed’, calling it one of Pakistan’s most pressing challenges.\n\nMr Qaiser, who is also the founding member of the PTI, warned that without judicial independence, the country could not function effectively.\n\nHe urged the ju­­diciary to make indepe­nd­ent decisions, free from ex­­­­­­ternal influence or dictation.\n\n“The entire nation stan­­ds with you,” he said, adding the people of Pakistan were looking towards the judiciary for decisive and impartial action.\n\nThe PTI leader also condemned Indian aggression in held Kashmir.\n\nHe dismissed any notion of division among Pakistanis as a “misconception”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
