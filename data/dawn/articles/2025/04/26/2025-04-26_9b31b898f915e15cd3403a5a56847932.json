Jaishankar said he discussed the Pahalgam attack and its “cross-border linkages” with the Saudi foreign minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi also offered mediation via a post on X.\n\n“India and Pakistan are brotherly neighbours of Iran, enjoying relations rooted in centuries-old cultural and civilisational ties,” he wrote. He added that Tehran was ready to “use its good offices in Islamabad and New Delhi to forge greater understanding at this difficult time”.\n\nIn a late-night statement after Aragchi’s call, the Foreign Office said, “DPM [Dar] … appreciated the efforts of Iran to diffuse the situation in the region.”\n\nEarlier, in his weekly briefing on Friday, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan had said that if any country offered mediation, Pakistan will consider it “at that point in time”.\n\nUN concern\n\nMeanwhile, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also voiced “deep concerns” over the escalating tensions and urged both countries to exercise “maximum restraint”.\n\nHe called for the dispute to be resolved peacefully through “meaningful mutual engagement” and said the UN was closely monitoring the situation, though he has not directly communicated with either country’s leadership.\n\nUN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York that issues between the countries “can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement”.\n\n“We very much appeal to both the governments… to exercise maximum restraint, and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further,” he said.\n\nWarning to India\n\nThe Foreign Office also delivered a stark rebuke to India on Friday, warning it not to push Islamabad towards taking “extreme steps” after the Modi government notified the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.\n\n“India should not create a situation where we are constrained to take extreme steps,” Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan said during the weekly briefing.\n\n“Any attempt to dramatically alter or stop the water would be considered an act of war,” he warned.\n\n“The Indus Waters Treaty is of critical importance for Pakistan’s water security and economy. Naturally, we will take all appropriate steps to preserve its sanctity and smooth implementation.”\n\nMr Khan criticised India for its “unlawful, unilateral, and irresponsible” suspension of the 1960 water-sharing pact.\n\nSuch actions “threaten the very foundations of the entire edifice of interstate cooperation and smooth implementation of the treaties”.\n\nHe stressed water continues to flow into Pakistan for now but said Islamabad will be closely monitoring the situation.\n\n“We will see how it progresses, but all options are on the table for Pakistan. It is our lifeline. It is our right, sanctified by international law, customary law and bilateral treaties. We will do everything to secure this right for our people.”\n\nThe strong statements came as India doubled down on its decision to halt water flows into Pakistan.\n\nIn New Delhi, Water Resources Minister C.R. Paatil said the Indian government had prepared a detailed roadmap to block the water flow into Pakistan.\n\nThe announcement followed a high-level meeting chaired by Union Home Minister Amit Shah and attended by senior officials.\n\nMr Khan, the FO spokesperson, also addressed the retaliatory measures announced by the National Security Committee on Thursday.\n\nHe said threatening statements were made by New Delhi to create a “jingoistic and belligerent atmosphere”.\n\nFiring at LOC\n\nIn another sign of acrimony between Pakistan and India, troops exchanged fire overnight across the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir, officials said on Friday.\n\nSyed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Azad Kashmir, told AFP on Friday that troops exchanged fire along the line separating the two countries.\n\n“There was no firing on the civilian population,” he added.\n\nIndia’s army confirmed there had been limited firing of small arms that it said had been “initiated by Pakistan”, adding it had been “effectively responded to”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
