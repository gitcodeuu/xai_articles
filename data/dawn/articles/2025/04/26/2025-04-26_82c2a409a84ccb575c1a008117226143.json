This includes collaboration to create conditions conducive for returns to Afghanistan, paving the way for sustainable voluntary returns in the future.\n\nIn Islamabad, Mr Mazou held meetings with Minister for Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and Safron Amir Muqam; Special Representative of Pakistan for Afghanistan, Ambassador Sadiq Khan as well as with senior officials of the ministries of interior and foreign affairs.\n\nDuring these discussions, the UNHCR official praised Pakistan’s tradition of hospitality towards Afghans with international protection and called for its continuation in light of the prevailing human rights and humanitarian situation in Afghanistan.\n\nOperations official wraps up visit to Pakistan\n\nHe emphasised UNHCR’s ongoing commitment to working with the government in a dialogue aimed at identifying long-term solutions as well as engaging in discussions to facilitate voluntary, dignified, and sustainable returns to Afghanistan.\n\nAdditionally, he highlighted the UN agency’s steadfast support for host communities, including targeted, area-based assistance efforts.\n\nHosting refugees for 45 years\n\nThe UNHCR official expressed appreciation for the generosity of the government and people of Pakistan for hosting Afghan refugees for over 45 years and urged continued solidarity with Pakistan, Afghan refugees and their host communities.\n\nWhile meeting members of the Afghan communities in Pakistan, Mr Mazou heard how their future prospects are full of uncertainty. Those he met also underscored their desire to continue to live in Pakistan as well as eventually in Afghanistan.\n\nMeanwhile, the flow monitoring snapshot of International Office for Migration says both inflow and outflow movement since last week, with inflows decreasing by 15 per cent and outflows decreasing by 11pc. Inflows were 112pc larger than outflows from April 13 to 19.\n\nThe decrease in inflows was higher at the border with Pakistan than at the border with Iran. Decreases among inflows at the border with Pakistan were mainly driven by flows at Torkham border point, which saw a 40pc decrease. Spin Boldak border point, on the other hand, saw a 17pc increase in inflows during this period.\n\nPakistan’s Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP) originally instructed undocumented and Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders to leave the country before March 31, a deadline which was first extended to April 10 and then to April 30, with the interior ministry declaring no more extensions afterwards.\n\nDocumentation trends at the border with Pakistan continue to see increasing proportions of undocumented individuals compared to previous weeks.\n\nDuring the reporting period, undocumented individuals accounted for 61pc of inflows from Torkham and Spin Boldak. Outflow reasons remain consistent at both borders with Iran and with Pakistan. Those going to Iran are mainly travelling for economic reasons (67pc) while those going to Pakistan are mainly travelling for health (58pc) and family reasons (49pc).\n\nA UNHCR update shows that over 118,400 Afghans have returned to Afghanistan from Pakistan from April 1 to 23. The majority of returns in April are undocumented (72pc), followed by ACC holders (23pc) and Proof of Registration card holders (5pc).\n\nAccording to the update, April deportation levels (25,6000) have now surpassed November 2023. In April, some 18,800 have been arrested and detained, mostly in Punjab and Balochistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
