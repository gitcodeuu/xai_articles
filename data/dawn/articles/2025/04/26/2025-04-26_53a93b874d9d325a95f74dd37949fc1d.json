Nonetheless, when we used to trade with India, it was in their favour vis-à-vis bilateral trade balance. They lost trade surplus when they stopped trading with Pakistan, he added.\n\nAbdul Mohamed Khan, Regional Chairman and Vice-President of FPCCI, reiterated the business community’s resolve that it would fully and whole-heartedly support Pakistan’s brave, professional and highly motivated armed forces.\n\nLeaders reiterate unflinching support to Pakistan armed forces\n\nBashir Janmohammad, a veteran trade leader, said that the business community has to stop all trade with India — until and unless they resolve the issues amicably, with mutual respect and equality.\n\nAman Paracha, FPCCI Vice-President, maintained that it is indeed India which has always sabotaged the prospects of regional trade, the enormous potential of transit-trade, border markets, intra-regional linkages and cooperation, materialisation of regional trade agreements and collective economic good of the Indian sub-continent and its people.\n\nNasir Khan, the Vice-President of the FPCCI, raised concerns about India’s capacity to look inward, given its army’s strength of over a million personnel. He stated that India should have been able to prevent attacks on its civilians and tourists.\n\nHe emphasised that this situation reflects a failure in their own security and intelligence systems, asserting that Pakistan has no involvement in these incidents.\n\nAll Karachi Industrial Alliance President Mian Zahid Hussain said India has seriously threatened regional stability and global peace.\n\nHe said that after the Indian drama in Pahalgam was exposed, the international community should play its role in de-escalating tensions.\n\nIndia is continuously fuelling terrorism, and false allegations against Pakistan are an essential part of its foreign policy. India aims to defame Pakistan to divert the world’s attention from its atrocities and internal problems, he said.\n\nIndia is creating instability not only in Kashmir but also in the entire South Asia for its nefarious purposes. The actions of the Indian government prove that India is a threat to world peace, he added.\n\nMr Hussain noted that India has always supported terrorism in Balochistan and helped terrorist groups in Afghanistan. India is continuously creating instability in Pakistan through terrorism, while Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka are also not safe from its snares.\n\nHe observed that India has been accused of serious human rights violations by several international organisations and many countries, including the United Nations. India is also involved in the murder of Sikh leaders in Canada, the United States and Pakistan. Violence against women, children and the elderly by 600,000 Indian troops in Kashmir and the killing of youth in fake encounters is common, he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
