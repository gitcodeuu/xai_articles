He cited the Green Pakistan Initiative as an example, where high taxes reduced the attractiveness of corporate farming investments.\n\nThe meeting agreed on establishing a steering committee and technical working groups to ensure coordination across federal and provincial levels.\n\nThe UN delegation briefed the minister on the ongoing efforts under the UN Joint Front to enhance access to healthy diets by identifying gaps and surpluses in food production across Pakistan.\n\nMr Laborde stressed that poor dietary choices — especially the growing reliance on processed, high-fat foods — contributed to health issues and reduced productivity. He noted the need for integrated approaches addressing food supply and consumer behaviour.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
