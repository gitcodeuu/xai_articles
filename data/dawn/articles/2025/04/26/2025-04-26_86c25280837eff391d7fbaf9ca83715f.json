  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday directed the Punjab Transport Department to formulate SOPs for the registration of motorcycle rickshaws and ensure that authorized dealers register every unit sold.\n\nJustice Shahid Karim was hearing petitions related to smog and other environmental issues.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the judge observed that the licenses of motorcycle-rickshaw manufacturers should be revoked, if they fail to comply within three months.\n\nThe judge expressed displeasure at the transport department for not issuing proper letters to the manufacturers and instructed that the letters include a reference to the court proceedings.\n\nThe judge said it appeared that the transport department wrote a “love letter” to the rickshaw manufacturers.\n\nJustice Karim directed that motorcycle rickshaw manufacturers must submit a detailed report of their authorized dealers to the transport department.\n\nThe judge declared that the transport department was responsible for law enforcement, not for making compromises.\n\nHe said the authorized dealers of rickshaws must ensure that buyers obtain a fitness certificate within 15 to 20 days of purchase.\n\nThe judge ordered that if fitness certificates were not obtained within a deadline of one month, the production of all motorcycle rickshaws should be halted.\n\nThe judge warned the authorities that the matter cannot be handled with leniency.\n\nExpressing concern over rising temperatures, Justice Karim noted that this month the mercury could exceed 40 degrees Celsius. He said Lahore had turned into a jungle of concrete. The judge stated that solar panels had helped somewhat in reducing the heat.\n\nHe suggested that tourist spots in Lahore should be identified and that people be encouraged to walk on those roads for a day or two every week.\n\nThe judge would resume further hearing on the petitions on May 2.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
