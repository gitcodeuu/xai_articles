Over the past three days, around 250,000 people filed past his body, laid out before the altar of the cavernous basilica.\n\nThe faithful hurried to the Vatican from the early hours while many camped out to try to secure spots at the front of the crowd.\n\n“When I arrived at the square, tears of sadness and also joy came over me. I think I truly realised that Pope Francis had left us, and at the same time, there is joy for all he has done for the Church,” said a French pilgrim, Aurelie Andre.\n\nFrancis, the first non-European pope for almost 13 centuries, battled to reshape the Roman Catholic Church, siding with the poor and marginalised, while challenging wealthy nations to help migrants and reverse climate change.\n\n“Francis left everyone a wonderful testimony of humanity, of a holy life and of universal fatherhood,” said a formal summary of his papacy, written in Latin, and placed next to his body.\n\nTraditionalists pushed back at his efforts to make the Church more transparent, while his pleas for an end to conflict, divisions and rampant capitalism often fell on deaf ears.\n\nThe pope carried his desire for greater simplicity in the papacy into his funeral, having rewritten the elaborate, book-long funeral rites used previously.\n\nHe also opted to forego a centuries-old practice of burying popes in three interlocking caskets made of cypress, lead and oak. Instead, he was placed in a single, zinc-lined wooden coffin, which was sealed closed overnight.\n\nIn a further break with the past, he will be the first pope to be buried outside the Vatican in more than a century, preferring St. Mary Major, some 5.5 kilometres from St. Peter’s.\n\nHis tomb has just “Franciscus”, his name in Latin, inscribed on the top. A reproduction of the simple, iron-plated cross he used to wear around his neck hangs above the marble slab.\n\nItaly mounted one of the biggest security operations the country has seen since the funeral of John Paul II. It closed the airspace over the city and called in extra security forces, with anti-aircraft missiles and patrol boats guarding the event.\n\nAs soon as Francis is buried, attention will switch to who might succeed him.\n\nThe secretive conclave to elect a successor is unlikely to begin before May 6, and might not start for several days after that, giving cardinals time to hold regular meetings beforehand to sum each other up and assess the state of the Church, beset by financial problems and ideological divisions.",
