  "content": "MOSCOW: US envoy Steve Witkoff and Russian President Vladimir Putin discussed the possibility of direct talks between Moscow and Kyiv in their fourth meeting on Friday, the Kremlin said, describing the talks as “constructive”.\n\n“There was a three-hour conversation that was constructive and very useful,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters, adding that “there was a discussion on the possibility of renewing direct negotiations between representatives of the Russian Federation and Ukraine”.\n\nSteve Witkoff has been facing accusations from Kyiv and its European allies for proposing terms for an end to the war that are too advantageous to Moscow.\n\nWitkoff has emerged as Washington’s key interlocutor with Putin as Trump pushes for a deal to end the war, now well into its fourth year, and has already held three long meetings with the Kremlin leader.\n\nHis latest trip follows talks this week at which Ukrainian and European officials pushed back against some of the US proposals for how to settle the conflict, the deadliest in Europe since World War Two.\n\nVideo published by the Kremlin showed Witkoff and Putin shaking hands and exchanging pleasantries before sitting down on opposite sides of a white oval table.\n\nPutin was accompanied by his foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and investment envoy Kirill Dmitriev.\n\nWitkoff’s latest visit comes a day after Trump criticised a Russian missile and drone attack on Kyiv that killed 12 people, and posted on social media: “Vladimir, STOP!” But Trump also said there had been significant progress in peace talks.\n\n“This next few days is going to be very important. Meetings are taking place right now.”\n\nWhile delivering upbeat comments on the chances of an agreement, Trump has also warned both sides that the US will walk away and abandon its effort unless there is genuine progress.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2025",
