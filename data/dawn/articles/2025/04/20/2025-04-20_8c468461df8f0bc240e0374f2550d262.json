Over 1,500 police officers and personnel were deployed at key points from residences to the Wagah Border to maintain high security.”\n\nHe highlighted that Dolphin Force, PRU (Police Response Unit), and Elite Force units were patrolling the designated routes to ensure smooth and secure transportation.\n\n“Sikh pilgrims are our honored guests. We are leaving no stone unturned to protect them with full responsibility and hospitality,” DIG Kamran affirmed.\n\nDuring their stay, the pilgrims attended rituals at major gurdwaras, including Gurdwara Panja Sahib, Nankana Sahib and Dera Sahib. This pilgrimage took place during Baisakhi, which marks the start of the Sikh New Year and commemorates the establishment of the Khalsa by Guru Gobind Singh in 1699. It also coincides with the wheat harvesting season in Punjab.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 20th, 2025",
