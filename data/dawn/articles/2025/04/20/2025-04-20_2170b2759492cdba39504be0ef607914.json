  "content": "LAHORE: It was so close yet so far for the battling West Indies women who missed the ICC World Cup qualification despite cruising to a six-wicket victory over Thailand under lights here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Saturday.\n\nThough the Hayley Matthews-inspired team in a blitz chased a modest 167 off just 10.5 overs — at a jaw-dropping run-rate of 15.50 — the effort fell short by a whisker. The Caribbean side required to reach the target off 10.1 overs in order to earn a better net run-rate than what the Bangladesh women achieved.\n\nBoth West Indies and Bangladesh ended the six-team ICC World Cup Qualifier on Saturday with three wins each — from five games — that gave them six points.\n\nThough Bangladesh were outplayed in a seven-wicket drubbing at the hands of Pakistan in the other match held earlier in the day at the LCCA ground, the former earned qualification with a net-run rate of +0.639 while West Indies managed +0.626.\n\nAs a result, Bangladesh became the eighth and last team to qualify for the World Cup. Pakistan had already qualified after winning against Thailand on Thursday.\n\nAfter electing to field first, West Indies dismissed Thailand for 166 in 46.1 overs, and then swiftly the modest target thanks to a rollicking half-century by Matthews.\n\nMatthews and fellow opener Qiana Joseph (26 off 12 balls) gave their team a thunderous start of 81 in just 5.3 overs. They touched the 100-mark in just 6.5 overs.\n\nThe dismissal of Joseph brought Chinelle Henry to the crease. Joseph struck four fours and a six.\n\nMatthews smashed a 29-ball 70 laced with 11 fours and a couple of sixes.\n\nHenry clobbered 48 off just 17 balls with the aid of five sixes and three fours. She was dismissed in the 11th over.\n\nAfter being put in to bat, Thailand posted a moderate total thanks to a 4-20 show by leg-spinner Afy Fletcher.\n\nMatthews was named player-of-the-match.\n\nPAKISTAN REMAIN UNBEATEN\n\nPakistan recorded a facile win over Bangladesh to remain unbeaten in the Qualifier.\n\nThe home team chased down the 179-run target in 39.4 overs with half-centuries from opener Muneeba Ali (69 off 93 balls) and Aliya Riaz (52 not out off 65).\n\nAfter losing Shawaal Zulfiqar (two) who was trapped by pacer Marufa Akter in the very first over, Muneeba and Sidra Amin (33) added 81 runs off 101 balls to lay the foundation of the victory.\n\nSidra was caught by wicket-keeper Dilara Akter in the 18th over bowled by leg-spinner Rabeya Khan. However, Muneeba and Aliya combined to add 74 runs off 97 balls for the third wicket to ensure a resounding win for the hosts. Muneeba struck eight fours. Aliya, who smashed six fours and a six, and Natalia Perviaz (13 not out) helped Pakistan reach the target without any further loss.\n\nAfter choosing to bat first, Bangladesh had made 178-9 off the stipulated overs with major contributions coming from Ritu Moni (48) and Fahima Khatun (44 not out).\n\nSadia Iqbal (3-28), Fatima Sana (2-45) and Diana Baig (2-45) were the prime wicket-takers. Muneeba earned the player-of-the-match honours.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 20th, 2025",
