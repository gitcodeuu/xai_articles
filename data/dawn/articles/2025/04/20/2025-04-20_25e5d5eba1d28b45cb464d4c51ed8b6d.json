  "content": "HYDERABAD: Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari visited several villages in Hyderabad district to inspect the houses constructed by the provincial government under its Sindh People’s Housing for Flood Affectees (SPHF) initiative.\n\nAccompanied by Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah and others, Mr Bhutto-Zardari reviewed the basic facilities available at the sites and distributed ownership certificates to the beneficiaries, said a PPP press release issued on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, he said that the PPP-led government had not only fulfilled its promise of rebuilding homes for flood survivors but taken a transformative step by awarding ownership rights in the name of women from the affected families — ensuring that an entire generation is empowered to move forward.\n\nHe said that a large number of houses had been completed, and these homes had now become valuable economic assets for the flood-affected families.\n\n“These homes will now be a great asset for you, an economic asset. You will be able to pass them on to your children in the future. These houses and this roof over your heads will remain yours forever — no one will be able to take them away from you,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Bhutto-Zardari inspected a tactile tile track constructed in Village Gul Hassan to assist visually impaired children in navigation. During his visit, he met two visually impaired children from a flood-affected family — nine-year-old Gul Hassan and 13-year-old Sajjad — who briefed him about how the tactile tile track helps them find their way.\n\nLater, in Village Jhundo Khoso, he distributed property ownership certificates among flood-affected families.\n\nOut of the 209 homes planned for this village, construction of 135 houses has been completed so far.\n\nHe also visited a school and dispensary in the flood-affected village of Himmatabad.\n\nDuring the briefing, he was informed that the area residents were once victims of bonded labour and had been resettled decades ago. Following the devastating floods, the Sindh government provided them with newly constructed homes.\n\nHe directed his party’s elected representatives to prioritise and resolve key issues faced by the village, including water shortages.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 20th, 2025",
