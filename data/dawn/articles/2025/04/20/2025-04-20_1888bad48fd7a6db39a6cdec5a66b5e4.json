The Sindh Assembly also passed a unanimous resolution against the project in March.\n\nThe past few months have seen nationwide protests from political parties and civilians against the proposed canal project. The canals controversy has deepened with Murad strongly criticising the Punjab government for increasing water being diverted to the TP Link Canal. The Indus River System Authority (Irsa) claimed to have taken all decisions as per the law.\n\nOn April 18, PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari threatened the ruling PML-N against continuing down the path of confrontation with Sindh over the issue of new canals on the Indus River.\n\nWhile addressing a large public gathering at the Hatri Bypass Ground on Friday night, he said his party would not go along with the federal government if it did not shelve the controversial project, even after acknowledging the PPP’s objections.\n\nSpeaking to the media in Hyderabad today, Minister of State for Religious Affairs Kesoo Mal Kheal Das assured the PPP that the federal government would not take “any unilateral” steps and hold talks with the party to arrive at a consensus over the issue.\n\n“No such action would be taken that would upset any province. I assure Sindh’s people that the Centre will not take any unilateral decision,” he said.\n\n“This step cannot be taken forward until the reservations of Sindh’s people are allayed,” the PML-N MNA added. Referring to the Council of Common Interests, he said discussions would be taken to the relevant “constitutional forum”.\n\nHe added that the canals project had not even been approved by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.\n\nAsked about a recent incident in which his vehicle was reportedly targeted by protesters in Thatta, he said: “I cannot say that the PPP was part of this. I consider the PPP a democratic party [and] it has never done such acts.\n\n“Everyone saw the flags and faces of those who carried out this attack, and a case has also been filed against them by the police. I have been told that some arrests have also been made,” he added.\n\n“In my opinion, such cowardly acts cannot stop us from our work,” the PML-N MNA said. He noted that Bilawal was a “national leader” and that representing the rights of Sindh, where his party was in power, was his responsibility.\n\n“There is nothing wrong with it. The PPP has the right to have its stance. There are protests and rallies in a democracy, but the only thing that should not be is incitement,” Kheal Das continued.\n\nThe PML-N lawmaker said he had spoken on the phone with PM Shehbaz yesterday on the issue of the canals project. “God-willing, the government will soon talk to the PPP leadership on this matter and we will invite them [the PPP] to talks so this matter can be solved amicably.\n\n“It is not a good thing to have infighting and hatred between provinces; it will hinder Pakistan’s development,” he said, noting that Sindh’s reservations were “justified and would be resolved”.\n\nHe added that some people wanted to conspire to create a rift between the PML-N and the PPP and that the government would “foil that conspiracy”.",
