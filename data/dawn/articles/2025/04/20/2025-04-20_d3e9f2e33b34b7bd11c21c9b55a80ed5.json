He noted that the application of Khula is found in the lifetime of the Holy Prophet (Peace be upon him) and thereafter.\n\nJustice Kamran referred to a Federal Shariat Court judgement which held that where a wife obtains Khula merely on the basis of dislike for her husband, the dower received by her is returnable.\n\nIt also held that where a wife seeks Khula due to fault on the part of the husband by providing reasonable justification, it is not valid to require from her the return of the dower already received by her.\n\nIn such an eventuality, the judge said, it is for the court to determine the amount the wife should return, keeping in view facts and circumstances of the case.\n\nAccording to the judge, a Nikahnama is a valid and binding contract between wife and husband — and deferred dower is a contractual obligation undertaken by the husband.\n\nContractual obligation\n\nHe said that unless there were valid legal grounds to deviate from the terms of this contract, the husband is bound to fulfill his obligation.\n\n“The mere fact that the wife sought Khula does not automatically nullify this contractual obligation,” he maintained. In order to determine the entitlement of a wife seeking Khula to the claim of deferred dower, the judge said, the key consideration is the reason for her seeking Khula.\n\nWhere a wife seeks Khula on the ground that she dislikes her husband, without any fault on the part of the husband, she loses her right to deferred dower in the same way as in the case of prompt dower, he explained.\n\nConversely, if the husband’s conduct compels the wife to seek dissolution, she retains her entitlement to the deferred dower, the judge added.\n\nJustice Kamran observed that in the instant case, the wife obtained the decree for dissolution of marriage on the basis of Khula, levelling allegations of bad conduct and disrespectful behaviour of the husband towards her.\n\nThe judge stated that the unchallenged, rather reaffirmed, allegation of bad conduct and disrespectful behaviour that amounts to cruelty provides a strong justification for the respondent/wife to be entitled to the full amount of her deferred dower in the same way as she would have been in case of divorce pronounced by the petitioner.\n\nThe judge concluded that since the marriage lasted nine years and the wife fulfilled her marital obligations, denying her the deferred dower would be unjust. The judge distinguished the case from earlier judgments cited by the petitioner’s counsel where cruelty by the husband was not proven.\n\nThe judge dismissed the husband’s petition against decisions of the district courts of Sahiwal, passed in favour of his former wife.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 20th, 2025",
