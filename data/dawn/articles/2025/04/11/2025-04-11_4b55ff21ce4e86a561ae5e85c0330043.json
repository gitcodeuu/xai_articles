  "content": "KARACHI: Overall auto sales —cars, LCVs, pickups and jeeps—clocked in at 11,098 units in March, reflecting an 18 per cent year-on-year (YoY) rise but fell by 8pc month-on-month (MoM).\n\nThe MoM decline was mainly due to a high base in February, when car sales typically surge at the start of the year, along with lower sales and delayed deliveries during Ramazan amid shorter working hours and subdued consumer activity.\n\nMyesha Sohail of Topline Securities said that the year-on-year growth is supported by a more stable macroeconomic environment, lower interest rates, easing inflation, and improving consumer sentiment.\n\nNew models and variants also boosted demand, taking 9MFY25 sales to 100,868 units, showing a 46pc year-on-year rise from 69,081 units in 9MFY24.\n\nBike and rickshaws\n\nThe two- and three-wheeler sales increased by 34pc year-on-year but down 3pc month-on-month, totalling 125,311 units in March. This excludes numbers for Royal Prince’s motorcycle and three-wheelers as data is still awaited. Total sales of the above segment during 9MFY25 stood at 1,089,922 units, posting a 31pc year-on-year rise. Atlas Honda Ltd (AHL) sold 917,598 bikes in 9MFY25, up by 27pc a year ago.\n\nThe total tractor industry recorded sales of 1,538 units, a 67pc year-on-year fall while flattish month-on-month, thus taking 9MFY25 sales to 23,230 units, thus recording a 34pc year-on-year fall.\n\nTruck and bus sales in March 2025 were up 47pc year-on-year while down 5pc month-on-month, reaching 460 units. Sales surged 80pc to 3,365 units during 9MFY25 from 1,869 units in 9MFY24.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
