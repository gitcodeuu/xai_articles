  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Price Monitoring Committee on Thursday showed concerns over the rising trend in perishable products and directed the Ministry of Food Security to develop a price control mechanism for poultry and promote the use of frozen chicken.\n\nThe committee, which met under the chairmanship of Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, reviewed the prices of essential food commodities. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) representatives briefed the meeting on the recent price trends.\n\nAn official announcement said that the minister noted the volatility in poultry prices and stressed the need to shift towards cold and frozen chicken, which ensures greater price stability. He also recommended promoting tomato paste production to mitigate price fluctuations of tomatoes.\n\nIn the next meeting, he called for an analysis of urban-rural price differentials within Islamabad.\n\nExpressing concern over the lack of institutional frameworks for key agricultural products, the minister criticised the absence of a national board for edible oil and vegetable processing. He stressed the urgent need for a land optimisation strategy to determine local production targets, import needs, and supply channels for major crops such as wheat, sugarcane, and rice.\n\nHe further underscored the importance of cold chains for perishable items and encouraged the industrial processing of vegetables like tomatoes. He urged the Ministry of Food Security to prepare an outcome-based plan to promote indigenous production of high-import commodities, especially edible oil, and develop a roadmap for optimal agricultural land utilisation and crop mixing. PBS also presented alarming wholesale-retail price gaps exceeding 20pc in major cities, with some differentials — such as those for onions and potatoes in Karachi and Quetta — exceeding 100pc. The ICT administration requested PBS to share the list of retailers involved in excessive profiteering for necessary action.\n\nIt was decided that PBS will share detailed market-wise data on wholesale-retail price gaps with provincial and district administrations to facilitate effective administrative actions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
