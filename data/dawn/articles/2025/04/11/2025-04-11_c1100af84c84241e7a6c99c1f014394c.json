Reformist media outlets struck a more optimistic tone, emphasising the potential economic and investment opportunities talks could create.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump unilaterally withdrew from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and world powers and reimposed sweeping economic sanctions.\n\nTehran adhered to the deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, for a year after Washington withdrew but later began rolling back its own commitments.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report in February, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran had an estimated 274.8 kilogrammes of uranium enriched to up to 60 per cent. Weapons grade is around 90pc.\n\nIran has also increased the number of centrifuges.",
