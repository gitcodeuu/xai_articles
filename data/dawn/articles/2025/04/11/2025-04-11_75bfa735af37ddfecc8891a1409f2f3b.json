  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The tenth edition of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) has arrived. That it will mark a decade of the country’s very own cash-rich franchise T20 tournament, is probably one of the very few special things about it, given where Pakistan cricket stands today.\n\nThe tournament has come amid the Pakistan Cricket Board’s (PCB) administrative turmoil and the national team’s spiraling decline over the last two years.\n\nThe PSL ‘X’, as it has been named this year, also coincides with the ongoing dissatisfaction of the biggest stakeholders of the league — the team owners — over its progress in the last 10 years.\n\nLast week, Multan Sultans owner Ali Tareen made waves by challenging the PCB’s claims of this year’s edition of the PSL being the “biggest ever”.\n\n“Same games, same teams. We always have nail-biting matches, but what’s different this time? Same stadiums too. Is that what will make this the best PSL ever? I’m tired of these empty words,” he had said.\n\nAli was contested by his Karachi Kings counterpart Salman Iqbal, who termed the PSL as a “made-in-Pakistan” success story and urged the former to “protect what we’ve built”.\n\nQuetta Gladiators owner, Nadeem Omar, meanwhile, had last year called for the league’s administrative model to be revisited, while Lahore Qalandars’ higher-ups have also expressed their concerns over the PSL’s running over the years.\n\nThe PCB, meanwhile, wants the PSL ‘X’ to be held in a “celebratory” environment, as its former chief operating officer and now PSL’s head Salman Naseer said at the Rawalpindi Stadium here on Thursday.\n\nSalman, who has served in varying roles in the PCB since 2011, spoke in the company of the PSL teams’ captains on the eve of the opener between Islamabad United and Lahore Qalandars.\n\nSalman highlighted the incorporation of the Match Officials’ Technology, the player tracking system and the introduction of Urdu commentary as the advancements that would define the new PSL season.\n\nHe also expected the “biggest window ever” of the PSL to garner maximum fan engagement.\n\nDespite all the pre-tournament talk, cricket will take center stage on Friday and Rawalpindi will be in the thick of it, with the venue to hosts 11 matches this year, the most it has ever since the PSL’s inception.\n\nThe home team, Islamabad United, also the current holders of the PSL title, won’t benefit from it much, as it will play only its five home matches at the venue.\n\nBut skipper Shadab Khan remains hopeful his side will make the most of their home advantage.\n\n“We have learned over the years how to fully make use of the conditions here at the Pindi Stadium,” he said. “I’m sure there will be some very good matches this year.”\n\nIslamabad United’s win in the final last year came at the expense of Multan Sultans, for whom it was the third consecutive defeat in a decider. But for Multan captain Mohammad Rizwan, “past is past” and he will be looking to have another go at glory.\n\n“The most important thing is to not repeat the same mistakes again,” he said.\n\nWhile the likes of Islamabad and Multan have stayed in reach of the title, Peshawar Zalmi have been waiting to get their hands on the trophy since 2017.\n\nAccording to their captain Babar Azam, Zalmi have “strengthened their core” for this season. “We have ensured we don’t fall short of resources when we need them,” he said.\n\nShaheen Shah Afridi, who led Lahore Qalandars to titles in 2022 and 2023 before seeing the team finish at the bottom of the league stage standings last year, said the trophy wasn’t the side’s primary target.\n\n“Our main aim is to produce and provide talented players to the Pakistan team,” he said. “Winning and losing is part of the game.”\n\nKarachi Kings, meanwhile, were arguably the least exciting side of the PSL last year. But the franchise has gone on the secure the services of Australian great David Warner — before also appointing him as captain — and former New Zealand skipper Kane Williamson.\n\nWhile Williamson will be available for only three matches of the Kings’ captain, Warner will be there for a longer time.\n\nWarner’s inclusion highlights Karachi’s intent to improve their performance with the bat in the powerplay, the team’s vice-captain Hasan Ali said, adding that the outfit had also strengthened its fast-bowling depth.\n\nQuetta Gladiators have also undergone a change in leadership with long-standing captain Sarfraz Ahmed passing the baton on to Pakistan Test mainstay Saud Shakeel, who believed the outfit needed to up its game.\n\n“The last few seasons haven’t been good for Quetta and like all other teams we have tried our best to assemble a quality squad,” noted the left-hander.\n\nA glittering opening ceremony before the start of play on Friday will mark the beginning of the new PSL season. The tournament is slated to run until May 18, with a significant part of it to run parallel with the Indian Premier League.\n\nThe 34-match tournament comprises of three-double headers, while the remaining fixtures will be single headers taking place across Karachi, Lahore, Multan and Rawalpindi.\n\nThe six teams will also be locking horns to take away the $500,000 prize money set for the winners, while the runners-up team will be awarded $200,000.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
