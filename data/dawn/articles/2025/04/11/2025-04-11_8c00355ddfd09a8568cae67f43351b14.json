  "content": "A high-school drama competition in Kenya was overshadowed by high drama of its own, after police fired tear gas to disperse a crowd that had gathered to watch a controversial play, BBC News reported.\n\nThe play, Echoes of War, is set in a fictional kingdom where the youth have lost faith in their leaders.\n\nIt features battles with the police and has drawn parallels with last year’s protests by young people against tax hikes.\n\nIt was initially disqualified from the drama festival under unclear circumstances, but a court ruling overturned the decision.\n\nTensions flared in the western town of Nakuru on Thursday morning when the student performers stormed out of the venue, demanding the release of the play’s author, Cleophas Malala, who had been detained by police.\n\nThe scriptwriter and former senator who penned the production for students from Butere Girls High School, was blocked by police from meeting the performers for final rehearsals on Wednesday evening, BBC News reported.\n\nHe was later released without charge and praised the students for boycotting the play.\n\n“The young girls of Butere Girls’ have exercised an act of heroic restoration. I’m determined to ensure that Echoes of War is displayed before a Kenyan audience,” Malala said immediately after his release.\n\nThe students briefly sang the national anthem before dramatically leaving the hall, which was sealed off by anti-riot police, armed with batons and tear gas canisters.\n\n“There’s no audience. Who are we performing for?” one of the girls told journalists.\n\nFollowing news of Malala’s arrest, large crowds had gathered outside the venue curious to watch the play.\n\nBut according to BBC News, anti-riot police had been deployed overnight in case of trouble and they fired tear gas to disperse the would-be audience.\n\nThe row has sparked public uproar, with rights group Amnesty International saying it was “pointing to a worrying pattern of state-sponsored repression of free expression, press freedom, and the right to associate”.\n\nThe fictitious kingdom in Echoes of War is ruled by a tyrannical sultan who is irked by the activism of the youth, portraying similarities to what is currently happening in Kenya, where young people have been demanding better governance.\n\nIt is not clear whether the play will now be disqualified and so not get through to the finals, which are held at State House with the president in attendance.\n\nThe annual high school drama competitions are hugely popular in Kenya, with students often using theatre as a tool to challenge those in power.\n\nThis is not the first time one of the plays has angered the authorities. In 2013, Malala made headlines with his controversial play Shackles of Doom, which thrust him into the national limelight — and eventually into politics.\n\nThe play, also performed by students of the same school, was banned by the government before a court ruled against the ban and allowed the play to be staged.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
