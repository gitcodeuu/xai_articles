Under the Mehmood Booti carbon credit project, the Ravi Urban and Development Authority (Ruda) will claim carbon credits through methane sequestration, which will be important for environmental protection.\n\nThe minister also praised the Sindh government’s mangrove projects, which will generate carbon credits, and further steps were being taken to protect these natural resources for long-term preservation.\n\nFollowing the impacts of climate change on the Margalla Hills, the minister announced measures for its protection and restoration, including the launch of a pilot project for carbon trading to safeguard the environment and reduce the effects of climate change.\n\nThe minister commended the green initiatives of the Punjab government, which aimed to benefit local communities through environmental protection while providing access to clean water and healthcare services.\n\nThe minister also spoke about climate justice, urging industrialised nations to take responsibility for their carbon emissions by purchasing carbon credits from climate-vulnerable countries like Pakistan.\n\nHe also criticised the global disparity in climate financing, revealing that 85 per cent of green finance was funnelled to the US, China, and Western nations, while developing countries like Pakistan were pressured to pay additional taxes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
