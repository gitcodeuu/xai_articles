The nation is also firmly resolved to completely eliminate the menace of khawarij,” President Zardari stated.\n\nHe said that eliminating the terrorist ringleader during the operation was a major success for the security forces.\n\nIn his message, Prime Minister Shehbaz said: “We will continue to thwart the evil designs of the enemies of humanity. Our war against terrorism will continue till the scourge is eliminated in total.”",
