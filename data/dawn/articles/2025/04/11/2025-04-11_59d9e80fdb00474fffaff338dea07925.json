There is no room for anybody or individual, including reservists in active duty, to exploit their military status while simultaneously participating in the fighting and calling for its cessation,” the official said.\n\nNetanyahu said he supported the move to dismiss any active pilots who had signed the letter. “Refusal is refusal — even when it is implied and expressed in euphemistic language,” a statement released by his office said.\n\n“Statements that weaken the IDF and strengthen our enemies during wartime are unforgivable”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
