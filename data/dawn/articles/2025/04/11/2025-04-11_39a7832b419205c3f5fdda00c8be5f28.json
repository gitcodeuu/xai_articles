She warned, however, that “if negotiations are not satisfactory, our countermeasures will kick in” and that all options remain on the table.\n\nWall Street slides\n\nWall Street stocks tumbled on Thursday on mounting worries over the economic impact of US President Donald Trump’s multi-front tariff war.\n\nAll three major US stock indexes fell sharply, forfeiting much of the previous session’s gains as growing concerns\n\nover the escalating Washington-Beijing trade face-off dampened optimism over upbeat economic data and US-Europe trade negotiations.\n\nAfter Trump announced a 90-day tariff reprieve on Wednesday, the S&P 500 surged 9.5pc, the largest one-day percentage jump since October 2008. The tech-heavy Nasdaq soared 12.2pc, notching its second-biggest daily gain on record.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,162.76 points, or 2.86pc, to 39,445.69.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
