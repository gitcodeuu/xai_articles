He said a mobile app will be launched soon for the convenience of citizens.\n\nPolicies to tackle trafficking\n\nSeparately, Mr Naqvi informed the National Assembly that the government has developed policies to combat human trafficking.\n\nHe, however, acknowledged that a number of challenges remained in fully addressing the issue.\n\nIn a written reply to a question posed by a lawmaker, he said amendm­e­­nts have been proposed in the Prevention of Traf­fic­king in Persons Act 2018 and Prevention of Smug­g­ling of Migrant Act 2018 to make them more effective.\n\nThe amendments — pa­­s­sed by the NA but awaiting approval from the Senate — focused on imp­osing longer imprisonment terms and higher fines for trafficking offences.\n\nHe said amendments in the Trafficking in Persons Act 2018 were proposed to address new forms of exploitation, such as organised beggary.\n\nAs a result of efficient im­­migration checks and pro­filing at airports, FIA has successfully intercep­t­­ed and offloaded 23,468 pa­­ssengers during 2023 (including 299 travelling on fake/forged documents) and 27,432 during 2024 (including 286 travelling on fake/forged docum­ents), the minister said.\n\nHe said ten new border crossing points have been notified along the western borders — with Afghanis­tan — to strengthen existing infrastructure and ensure legal immigration.\n\nThe FIA has already implemented the One-Document Regime (ODR) at all immigration checkpoints along the western border.\n\nThe move has brought immigration operations at par with those existing international airports.\n\nThe installation of Integ­rated Border Ma­­na­gement System will ensure real-time data capture of all travellers with enf­or­cem­e­­nt of stop lists to curb hu­­man trafficking and smuggling.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
