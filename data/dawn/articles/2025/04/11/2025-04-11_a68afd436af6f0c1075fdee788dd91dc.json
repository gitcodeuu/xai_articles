  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Punjab Environment Protection Agency (EPA) Rawalpindi chapter has sealed around six car service stations for not installing mandatory water recycling systems.\n\nThe department has also issued notices to and issued notices to 123.\n\nIn view of the severe drought situation in the province and following the directions of the Lahore High Court, the EPA has banned the establishment of new service stations across Punjab. Along with this, the installation of water recycling systems has been made mandatory at all existing service stations.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that the Punjab Environment Department has already banned washing cars and using water pipes at home, enforcing a fine of Rs10,000 for violators.\n\nAccording to a notification issued by the department, all illegal service stations have been ordered to shut down immediately.\n\nMoreover, service stations operating without a water recycling system will face a hefty fine of Rs100,000.\n\nTo comply with the new regulations, service stations across Punjab were ordered to install water recycling systems by February 28, 2025. A team from EPA Rawalpindi, led by Deputy Director Maria Safir, Inspector Inamul Haq and Inspector Atta Muhammad, inspected various service stations.\n\nDuring the inspection, six service stations were sealed as they failed to install water recycling systems in violation of the court orders.\n\nHowever, an official of EPA said that so far, 18 service stations have completed the implementation of the orders by installing water recycling systems, which is a welcome development in terms of water conservation.\n\nHe said, “These measures are being taken to protect water resources and address the drought crisis in the province, and no negligence will be tolerated in this regard.”\n\nAuthorities have urged citizens and service station owners to ensure full implementation of the instructions issued for environmental protection and preservation of natural resources.\n\nMeanwhile, ongoing drought conditions are severely worsening the water crisis in twin cities and across the six districts of Rawalpindi Division including Rawalpindi, Attock, Jhelum, Chakwal, Gujar Khan, and Murree.\n\nIn a move to address the impending crisis, the EPA has imposed a ban on the use of water hosepipes effective April 10.\n\nViolations will result in legal action, challans, and heavy fines.\n\nWater rationing has already begun in the twin cities as reserves in Rawal Dam, Simly Dam, and Khanpur Dam fall dangerously low — with only about 40 days of water left.\n\nEPA Director General Dr Imran Hamid Sheikh issued the notification, banning the use of hoses for washing cars at homes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
