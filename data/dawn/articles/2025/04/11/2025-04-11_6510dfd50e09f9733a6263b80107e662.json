  "content": "MUZAFFARABAD: A senior leader of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) on Thursday expressed grave concern over what he termed as unchecked constitutional violations and deepening political, social, and administrative crises in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), calling upon political parties and civil society to play their part in upholding the rule of law and protecting the democratic rights of the Kashmiri people.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Chaudhry Tariq Farooq, the regional secretary-general of the PML-N and former senior minister, accused Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq of pursuing an “unconstitutional and unethical rule” in collusion with certain elements over the past two years.\n\nHe alleged that political parties had been deliberately side-lined and discredited, citizens forced onto the streets to resolve even minor issues, and regular as well as temporary government employees had faced economic exploitation through mass dismissals.\n\nHe further claimed that local bodies had been stripped of authority, justice institutions rendered ineffective, and the senior bureaucracy targeted for personal vendettas, while others were made to act as subordinates.\n\n“The Planning and Development Department has been practically dismantled through misuse of block provisions. The Assembly Speaker has been held hostage, media outlets gagged in the name of national interest, and press unions coerced into compliance through financial inducements,” he added.\n\nMr Farooq also accused the government of trying to manipulate legal associations by offering them financial incentives to bring them under control.\n\n“These actions are in stark violation of the interim constitutional and democratic framework of the liberated territory,” said Mr Farooq, a political heavyweight from Bhimber.\n\nHe alleged that state institutions were being run under a deliberately cultivated impression that the AJK premier enjoyed absolute powers, with all legal and constitutional restraints dismissed as obstacles to his personal ambitions.\n\nThis, he maintained, was again demonstrated when the prime minister allegedly sought to undermine the credibility of the Election Commission in an attempt to install a pliant Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) to influence the outcome of the upcoming elections in favour of himself and a few allies.\n\nUnder Article 50, Clause 4 of the AJK Interim Constitution, the prime minister is required to consult the Leader of the Opposition before forwarding a panel of names for CEC appointment to the Chairman of the AJK Council.\n\nHowever, Mr Farooq said, the premier had been deliberately blocking this constitutional process since January — a serious violation that warranted immediate action.\n\n“Unfortunately, other constitutional institutions appear to be in a deep slumber, pacified by the illusion that all is well,” he remarked.\n\nResponding to a question, Mr Farooq lamented that neither the federal government nor the institutions of state had taken timely notice of the situation — possibly, he suggested, due to the prime minister’s backing by “powerful quarters” who enable him to overstep boundaries to serve their interests.\n\nReferring to a letter from PML-N’s regional president Shah Ghulam Qadir to the Chairman of the AJK Council, he said it had highlighted serious constitutional concerns and since Mr Haq had no response he had adopted a “mysterious and sinister silence.”\n\n“There is growing speculation that preparations are underway to bring a particular person to power in the next elections,” he warned.\n\n“To this end, selected members of the Assembly, leaders of some political parties, the opposition leader, and even constitutional heads may have been taken into confidence. If true, this would be a grave attack on the people’s right to vote.”\n\nMr Farooq asserted that the people of AJK had the right to elect their representatives through free, fair, and transparent elections that ensured equal treatment for all.\n\n“Sadly, the current government has manufactured crises at every turn, placed personal gain over public interest, and adopted a policy of blackmail towards Pakistan’s institutions and leadership.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
