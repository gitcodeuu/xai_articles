He said a one-document regime would be fully implemented, requiring valid visas and passports to enter Pakistan.\n\nHe recalled that the policy of repatriating illegal foreign nationals had been in effect since October 2023 and listed its phases: in the first phase, undocumented foreigners without legal documents were sent back. In the second phase, the Afghan Citizen Card\n\nholders are being repatriated, while in the third phase, those who have the Proof of Registration (PoR) cards will be deported.\n\nHe explained that the decision to expel these pe­o­ple was taken in light of current ground realities and security concerns. It had been observed that Afg­han citizens were involved in narcotics trade and terrorism in Pakistan, he claimed.\n\nDiscussing arrangements to ensure the dignity of ACC holders, he claimed that all provinces, including Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, were fully on board with this initiative.\n\nHe said that 38 transit points have been established in Punjab, three in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, two in Sindh, three in Azad Kashmir, and one each in Balochistan, Islamabad, and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nHe said ACC holders were kept at these facilities before their onwards journey to Afghanistan, adding that they were being provided with shelter, food, medical care, and transport facilities.\n\nSharing the figure of the registered Afghan nationals, the minister said there were 815,247 Afghan Citi­zen Card holders, while 1,469,522 were registered under the PoR programme.\n\nAnswering a question, he said a mechanism was in place to track and deport Afghans who were neither registered with the UNHCR nor awaiting resettlement to a third country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 11th, 2025",
