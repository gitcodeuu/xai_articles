He termed the incident a glaring failure of Indian government.\n\nExpressing sorrow over the loss of innocent lives in the incident, Mr Gandapur criticised Indian leaders for using the incident as a pretext to malign Pakistan in order to cover up their incompetence.\n\nCM chairs meeting of cabinet to approve changes in charities law\n\nHe said that any hostile move by India at the pretext of that event would incur a heavy price. He said that Pakistani nation stood united in safeguarding its sovereignty and national interests, and was ready to make any sacrifice for the purpose.\n\nHe stated that India’s aggressive policies posed a threat to regional peace.\n\nMeanwhile, in another statement issued after the cabinet meeting, provincial government spokesperson Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif said that cabinet approved draft bill for amendments in Section-12 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Charities Act, 2019, which provided for renewing the registration of a charity after every two years of registration.\n\nSimilarly, the cabinet approved adding new set of rules Part IX-A in West Pakistan Land Revenue Rules, 1968, in pursuance of the provisions of sections 121, 122 (2), 129 (1), 148 and 182 of West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967.\n\nThe new set of rules pertains to demarcation of land and eviction of unauthorised landowners.\n\nThe cabinet, according to Mr Saif, accorded approval to appointment of two members for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Information Technology Board.
