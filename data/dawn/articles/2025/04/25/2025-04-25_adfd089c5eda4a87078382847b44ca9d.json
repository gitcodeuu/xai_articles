The banking sector exhibited steady performance and maintained its financial soundness. The balance sheet of the banks expanded by 15.8pc in CY24. Both investment and advances drove the expansion in assets.\n\n“Private sector advances witnessed a strong rebound, due to revival in economic activity, easing in monetary policy, and advances-to-deposit ratio (ADR) linked tax policy for income from government securities,” said the report, adding that this tax policy also dampened the deposit mobilisation, which further increased the banks’ reliance on borrowings.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
