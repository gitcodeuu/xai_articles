The destruction has spared no one,” he told AFP.\n\nNine people were killed and several wounded in another strike on a former police station in the Jabalia area of northern Gaza, according to a statement from the Indonesian hospital, where the casualties were taken.\n\n“Everyone started running and screaming, not knowing what to do from the horror and severity of the bombing,” said Abdel Qader Sabah, 23, from Jabalia.\n\nIn another deadly attack, the bodies of 12 people were recovered after the Hajj Ali family home, also in Jabalia, was struck, the civil defence said.\n\nAnother 28 people were killed in strikes across the territory, medics and the civil defence agency reported.\n\nThey came as the Israeli military ordered Palestinians living in the northern areas of Beit Hanoun and Sheikh Zayed to evacuate ahead of an attack.\n\nThe United Nations has warned that Israel’s expanding evacuation orders across Gaza are resulting in the “forcible transfer” of people into ever-shrinking areas.\n\nAid agencies estimate that the vast majority of Gaza’s 2.4 million residents have been displaced at least once since the war began.\n\nKilled ‘one by one’\n\nIn the aftermath of a strike in Khan Yunis, AFP footage showed bodies on the ground, including those of a young woman and a boy in body bags, surrounded by grieving relatives kissing and stroking their faces.\n\n“One by one we are getting martyred, dying in pieces,” said Rania al-Jumla who lost her sister in another strike in Khan Yunis.\n\nSince Israel resumed its military operations, at least 1,978 people have been killed in Gaza, raising the overall death toll to at least 51,355 since the war began, according to the health ministry in the territory.\n\nThe military acknowledged on Thursday that Israeli tank fire had killed a UN worker in the central Gaza city of Deir el-Balah last month, according to an investigation’s initial findings.\n\nIt had initially denied operating in the area where a Bulgarian employee of United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) was killed on March 19.\n\nBulgaria said it had received an “official apology” from Israel over the killing.\n\nThe findings came after the military on Sunday reported on a separate probe into the killing of 15 Palestinian emergency workers in Gaza.\n\nIt admitted that operational failures led to their deaths, and said a field commander would be dismissed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
