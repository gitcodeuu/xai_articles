He speculated that the government, as the owner of these plants, may offset its revenue loss by reducing subsidy allocations.\n\nThe government’s team, led by Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA) CEO Rihan Akhtar, said the revised terms of contracts would entail savings of about Rs1.57tr, including Rs21.65bn in the current year alone.\n\nHe said the revised terms are expected to lower per unit electricity costs by 25-32 paise, with average 30-year tariffs ranging between Rs9 and Rs12 per unit.\n\nMr Akhtar explained that the contract revisions cover four government power projects: the LNG-based Balloki and Haveli Bahadurshah plants (each around 1,220MW, with combined reported savings of about Rs1.1tr), as well as the 747MW Guddu and 510MW Nandipur projects (combined savings of Rs355 billion).\n\nThe savings come largely from reduced capacity charges and lower operation and maintenance costs.\n\nHe said the average tariff would become cheaper by Rs0.25 per unit for the Guddu plant, Rs0.32 for Nandipur, Rs0.27 for Haveli Bahadurshah and Rs0.26 for Balloki.\n\nIt was reported that revised terms for Balloki and Haveli Bahadurshah would become effective from Jan 1, 2025, while Guddu and Nandipur would be revised from Feb 1.\n\nThe request involves change in term of contracts from ‘take or pay’ to a ‘hybrid take and pay model’, reduction in rate of return and a cap on dollar indexation at Rs168.\n\nNepra announced that it had decided to discontinue dollar-based indexations for these plants, transitioning instead to rupee-based indexations fixed for the entire useful life of the power projects.\n\n“This strategic revision aims to curb foreign exchange exposure and reduce tariff volatility for consumers,” it said, adding that it also capped the indexation for operations and maintenance (O&M) costs to 70pc of rupee devaluation, down from the previous 100pc.\n\nAdditionally, the return on equity (ROE) structure has been rationalised and the plants will now receive 35pc of the ROE as fixed, with the remaining 65pc linked directly to the actual operation of the plant — a significant departure from the previous 100pc guaranteed ROE model.\n\nIn their joint applications, the CPPA and GPPs have reported that negotiated settlement agreements (NSAs) were signed on April 8, following the federal cabinet’s formal agreement on March 19 to reduce consumer-end tariffs and alleviate the burden on the general public through a ‘hybrid take and pay’ model.\n\nThe applicants requested that Nepra waive the applicable tariff fees, citing national interest and consumer benefit. Under the NSA, key tariff components will be restructured, including the indexation of O&M.\n\nThe revised O&M costs will be indexed quarterly. Local and variable components will be adjusted at the lower of five per cent per annum or the actual average national Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the preceding 12 months.\n\nFor the fixed foreign and variable components, the current indexation mechanism will continue; however, rupee depreciation against the US dollar will be factored in only up to 70pc of the actual annual depreciation. In contrast, any appreciation in the rupee’s value will be fully passed on to consumers.\n\nThe return on equity (ROE) component shall be redetermined to a 13pc rate of return at the fixed exchange rate of Rs168 per dollar based on Nepra-determined quarterly indexation for the October-December 2024 period as a revised reference. Thereafter, there shall be no exchange rate indexation.\n\nFrom the effective implementation date, the capacity purchase price (CPP) insurance component will be treated as a pass-through item, capped at 0.8pc of the sum insured under the power purchase agreements.\n\nUnder the NSA, the applicants agreed to implement a ‘hybrid take-and-pay model’, whereby tariff payment to the company shall be made by the CPPA as follows: from the effective date, prorated for remaining period of the current agreement year, and thereafter for every agreement year, the company will be entitled to 35pc of revised RoE components of tariff as part of the CPP.\n\nFrom the effective date, in case the despatched and delivered net electrical output (NEO) of the company exceeds 35pc of the total contract capacity in terms of kilowatt-hours (kWh), then the company will be entitled to receive RoE components of tariff, which shall be calculated on the actual NEO exceeding 35pc of the total contract capacity in terms of kWh and the company shall claim the differential CPP accordingly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
