Laghari and Yasir Arafat Shar.\n\nSave Indus River Movement rejects PM’s announcement\n\nThe Save Indus River Movement — a conglomerate of nationalist, religious and political parties and civil society — has rejected the prime minister’s announcement meeting and termed it a “betrayal with people of Sindh”.\n\n“The people of Sindh have spoken loud and clear that they will no longer fall for lollipops or deceptive tactics,” said a statement issued after a meeting of the movement’s leaders.\n\nThe meeting, attended by the movement’s convener Sindh United Party chief Syed Zain Shah, Grand Democratic Alliance leader Dr Safdar Abbasi, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Pakistan Sindh chief Haleem Adil Sheikh, Pakistan Muslim League-Functional’s Sardar Abdul Rahim, GDA leader Hasnain Mirza, and other key leaders, said that PPP had already “compromised” Sindh’s interests, making it impossible for the party to cancel the controversial project.\n\nThe meeting questioned why allocations of land were made under the Green Pakistan Initiative had not yet been revoked — despite this falling within purview of the Sindh government’s authority.\n\n“Participants [in the meeting] asserted that the May 2 lollipop will not be accepted by the people of Sindh under any circumstances, and warned the PPP that if it believes it can once again deceive the public, it is gravely mistaken,” it added.\n\nTalking to Dawn, Dr Abbasi said that referring the canal issue to the CCI did not signify its resolution it merely caused to prolong it. “We firmly believe there is no room for debate on this issue,” he added.\n\n“The canal project must be scrapped once and for all. We do not recognise the CCI, nor do we consider its members legitimate representatives of people. Our protest will continue unabated until our demands are fully met and the project is permanently abandoned,” he said. AT sees PM-Bhutto-Zardari meet as betrayal to Sindh\n\nAwami Tehreek’s central president, Advocate Vasand Thari, said that the decision to take the canals issue to the CCI taken in a meeting between the prime minister and Bhutto-Zardari was a complete betrayal to people of Sindh.\n\nA statement issued by the party said that despite unabated protests by Sindh’s people, the leadership of the PML-N and PPP was not willing to quit their stubborn stance. As majority on the CCI was from Punjab, the council had lost its integrity, it said.\n\nNo person in Sindh trusted the CCI, which had made a wrong decision about the census and conspired to turn Sindhis into a minority, hence all its decisions were rejected, it said.\n\nIt said the prime minister had the authority to reject the controversial projects but this was not done in the PM-Bhutto-Zardari meeting. The people of Sindh had not given PPP any right to decide their fate, it said.\n\nThari said that he along with central leadership of the party and a large number of women from Sindhyani Tehreek would participate in the Babarloi sit-in today.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
