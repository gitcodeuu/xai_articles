  "content": "United States President Donald Trump on Friday expressed hope that Pakistan and India would “figure out” the rising tensions between them as both countries imposed tit-for-tat diplomatic measures over a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.\n\nThe attack took place in Pahalgam, a tourist hotspot in India-occupied Kashmir that draws thousands of visitors every summer. Gunmen opened fire on visitors, killing at least 26 people — all men from across India except one from Nepal — and injuring 17 others.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said in response to a question about the situation that tensions between the nations had existed for “1,500 years, so you know, the same as it’s been”.\n\nHe added: “But, they’ll get it figured out, one way or the other, I’m sure of that. There’s been great tension between Pakistan and India, but there always has been.”\n\nWhen asked if he would speak to either Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif or Narendra Modi, Trump replied, “I am very close to India and I’m very close to Pakistan as you know,” adding that the Kashmir dispute had been ongoing “for a thousand years, probably longer than that”.\n\nIn a briefing on Thursday, US State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce had also touched on the crisis brewing in South Asia.\n\n“It’s a rapidly changing situation and we are monitoring it closely … We are not now taking a position on the status of Kashmir or Jammu,” she said, adding that this was all she had to say on the subject.\n\nUnited Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres had also urged Pakistan and India to show “maximum restraint”.\n\n“The secretary general is obviously following the situation very closely and with very great concern,” his spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters in New York on Thursday.\n\n“We very much appeal to both the governments … to exercise maximum restraint, and to ensure that the situation and the developments we’ve seen do not deteriorate any further.”\n\nTo a question, the spokesman said that the UN chief has not had any direct contact with the leadership of India and Pakistan.\n\nDujarric said: “We believe that any issues between Pakistan and India can be and should be resolved peacefully through meaningful mutual engagement.”\n\nSpecifically asked to comment on the suspension by India of the Indus Waters Treaty, Dujarric said, “I think this would go under the rubric of us appealing for maximum restraint and not taking any actions that would deteriorate the situation further or increase tensions in a tense area.”\n\nJust hours after the UN called for restraint, however, troops from Pakistan and India exchanged fire overnight across the Line of Control (LoC), officials said today.\n\nSyed Ashfaq Gilani, a government official in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, told AFP today that troops exchanged fire along the LoC. “There was no firing on the civilian population,” he said.\n\nDawn.com has reached out to the Foreign Office for comment.\n\nPakistan has announced the suspension of trade and the closure of airspaces with India, among other moves, as it retaliated to New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country following the deadly attack.\n\nAmong India’s actions was the unilateral move to suspend the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty, which was brokered by the World Bank and has endured through wars and decades of hostility.\n\nPakistan made the retaliatory decisions during a meeting of the National Security Committee (NSC) in Islamabad a day ago, convened to formulate a response to India. Chaired by PM Shehbaz, the meeting was attended by top government and military officials, including the defence minister, foreign minister, interior minister, national security adviser, and the chiefs of armed forces, among others.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), the participants of the meeting discussed the national security environment and the regional situation, particularly in the wake of the Pahalgam attack.\n\nThe full text of the statement can be read here.\n\n“Expressing concern over the loss of tourists’ lives, the committee reviewed the Indian measures announced on 23rd April 2025 and termed them unilateral, unjust, politically motivated, extremely irresponsible and devoid of legal merit,” the statement added.\n\nThe NSC announced a series of measures in retaliation to the “reckless and irresponsible behaviour of India, which disregards international conventions, UN Security Council Resolutions and international obligations at will”.\n\nPakistan also announced the closure of the Wagah Border with India.\n\n“Pakistan shall exercise the right to hold all bilateral agreements with India including but not limited to Simla Agreement in abeyance, till India desists from its manifested behaviour of fomenting terrorism inside Pakistan; trans-national killings; and non-adherence to international law and UN Resolutions on Kashmir,” the PMO statement said.\n\nDuring his weekly press briefing today, Foreign Office Spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated the steps announced by the Prime Minister’s Office yesterday following New Delhi’s measures against Pakistan in the wake of the attack.\n\nIn a briefing to President Asif Ali Zardari today on India’s “irresponsible conduct”, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi provided a detailed overview of the NSC’s decisions and the countermeasures implemented in response.\n\nThe president commended the swift and prudent actions of the NSC, describing its decisions as both timely and visionary.\n\nHe highlighted that the committee’s stance reflects the sentiments and aspirations of the Pakistani nation.\n\n“The entire country stands united behind the NSC’s decisions and actions,” the president said, adding that India’s “baseless accusations and irrational measures” lack any credibility or justification.\n\nInterior Minister Naqvi reiterated Pakistan’s firm resolve and readiness to defend its sovereignty, adding that “the enemy must not be under any illusion”.\n\n“Pakistan’s defence is impregnable,” he asserted.\n\nThe meeting underscored the leadership’s commitment to national security and its collective stance in the face of external provocations.\n\nBriefing heads of mission and diplomats based in Islamabad on the developing situation today, Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch outlined the key takeaways from the NSC meeting, categorically rejecting India’s baseless allegations linking Pakistan to the attack.\n\nAccording to a post on X, the foreign secretary warned that India’s attempts to weaponise terrorism for political gains threatened regional peace and security.\n\nShe also cautioned against India’s escalatory actions and reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to respond firmly to any aggressive moves.",
