  "content": "LAHORE: In a surprising move, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has decided to again revamp the game’s domestic structure, and in this regard it has formed a head-less five-member committee, having no official from domestic departments.\n\nLast year, the PCB reva­mped the domestic system, the major part was the introduction of the Cham­pions Cup, inter-collegiate tournament and a few other events, but omitted National One-day Cup (reg­i­onal event) and national jun­ior boys’ and girls’ events.\n\nIn an astonishing move, the boys’ junior tournament was postponed all of a sudden after first day’s play of the opening round had been completed. This tournament has not been held so far.\n\nMeanwhile, the PCB in forming the said committee kept its policy of chang­ing the role of some individuals.\n\nData analyst Bilal Afzal, who was included in the first seven-member head-less national selection committee and has no experience of international cricket whatsoever, has been mentioned as adviser to PCB chairman in the notification on the committee.\n\nFormer Test fast bowler Wahab Riaz, who was also included in the same selection committee and later enjoyed the newly-created post of the Pakistan team’s senior manager and now acting as director of the Champion Cup events, is also part of the committee.\n\nEx-Test pacer Aaqib Javed, a national selector who recently quit as the national team’s interim head coach, is also included in the committee.\n\nPCB chief operating officer Sumair Syed and president of the Lahore Region Cricket Associa­tion Khawaja Nadeem are the two other members.\n\nInterestingly, PCB dire­ctor domestic cricket Khu­r­ram Niazi and senior general manager Junaid Zia are not part of the committee in any capacity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
