Singh of the 182nd battalion, was apprehended after crossing the border in Kasur district.\n\nThe Indian trooper ap­­parently entered Pakis­ta­­ni territory near the Fer­ozepur Road border inadvertently and was subsequently detained by the Rangers, the official said.\n\nThe Indian media clai­med that the incident oc­­c­urred on Wednesday aft­e­rnoon. Cons­table Singh, in uniform and carrying his service rifle, paused to rest in the shade and “unintentionally” crossed the border, where he was taken into custody.\n\nIndian media outlets also reported that a flag meeting between the BSF and Pakistan Rangers was convened at the Attari-Wagah border to negotiate Mr Singh’s release.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
