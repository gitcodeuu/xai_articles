  "content": "KARACHI: A teenage Hafiz-i-Quran was killed in an exchange of gunfire between robbers and a citizen in Orangi Town, police said on Thursday.\n\nPakistan Bazaar SHO Inayatullah Marwat told Dawn that two muggers snatched valuables from Shahenshah Hasan in Sector-16-B. As they were fleeing, the citizen took out his pistol and opened fire. The robbers also retaliated and in an ensuing exchange of gunfire both suspects and a 14-year-old passer-by, later identified as Hafiz Hussain Ali, suffered bullet wounds.\n\nHe said that while one suspect died on the spot, the boy was taken to a hospital where he died during treatment. The second robber managed to escape in wounded condition.\n\nA relative of the deceased teenager, however, presented a different version. He told the media that Hussain was standing outside a mosque when two robbers attempted to snatch his cell phone and shot him when he put up resistance.\n\nHowever, SHO Marwat rejected the version of the relatives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
