  "content": "ISLAMABAD: People on Thursday staged a protest in front of the Indian High Commission in the federal capital, denouncing “false accusations and war-mongering”.\n\nEarlier, people from civil society and various walks of life assembled in front of the Foreign Office, located on Constitution Avenue, around 4pm to protest against India over “water aggression”.\n\nLaw enforcers and officials from the capital administration reached the scene to maintain law and order.\n\nThe protestors remained there for about an hour. Later, a small group moved towards the Diplomatic Enclave and attempted to enter through Gate No 2, also known as the Foreign Office Gate.\n\nHowever, law enforcers intercepted them and closed the gate.\n\nThey engaged with the protestors, but the group continued trying to reach the high commission.\n\nLater, another group approached the gate, climbed over it, jumped inside the enclave and opened the gate.\n\nAs a result, the protestors entered the enclave and moved towards the Indian High Commission. Law enforcers were also deployed outside the high commission to maintain law and order and prevent any untoward incident.\n\nAfter reaching the Indian High Commission, the gathering staged a protest outside, chanting slogans against India and its prime minister. Later, the protestors dispersed peacefully.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 25th, 2025",
