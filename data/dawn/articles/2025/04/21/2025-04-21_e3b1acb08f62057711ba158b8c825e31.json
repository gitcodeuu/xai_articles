His statement showed work at the site is stopped for the time being,” he said.\n\nThe team member believed the strip was “probably built for the inauguration ceremony” of the Green Pakistan Initiative, a corporate farming project, in February, which was attended by Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
