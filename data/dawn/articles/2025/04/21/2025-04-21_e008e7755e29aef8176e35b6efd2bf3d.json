  "content": "RAWALPINDI: After 40 days of fasting, the Christian community celebrated Easter — the second most important festival in the Christian calendar — on Sunday with religious fervour and joy.\n\nThe churches of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad were decorated with lights and flowers. Carols and hymns were sung, and the story of Jesus Christ’s crucifixion and resurrection was reenacted.\n\nThe sunrise procession, which is the main ritual of Easter Sunday, was limited to the premises of the churches.\n\nAt St Paul’s Church on The Mall, the sunrise procession was traditionally brought out from the General Post Office to the church in previous years, but due to ongoing construction work on The Mall, it was restricted to the church grounds.\n\nThere was hustle and bustle in and around the churches of Rawalpindi and Islamabad as Christian community members gathered at their places of worship to celebrate the festival, which falls in March or April according to the lunar calendar. The cathedrals organised midnight services between Saturday and Sunday, during which prayers were offered.\n\nThese were followed by morning services held in various churches across the garrison city.\n\nDuring the main congregations on Sunday, Christian faith leaders stressed the need for religious tolerance, fraternity and brotherhood. They emphasised the importance of spreading Jesus Christ’s message of love for humanity without discrimination.\n\n“Easter is a family day, and Christians spend it with their loved ones. Special feasts, usually made from meat, are served as it marks the end of the 40-day fasting period in Christianity,” said Arman Gill, a visitor at St Joseph’s Cathedral.\n\nHe added that Easter eggs made of chocolate were prepared at home and also purchased from bakeries, then presented to family members and friends as gifts.\n\n“The egg symbolises fertility and new birth. Easter eggs are distributed among friends and family to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ after his crucifixion,” he explained.\n\nTauqeer Bhatti noted the difference between Christmas and Easter. “For Christians, Christmas is a major celebration as it marks the birth of Jesus. Easter, on the other hand, is a more solemn occasion focused on prayers and family gatherings,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rawalpindi administration and police made special security arrangements in and around the churches.\n\nPolitical party leaders also visited Christian localities to express solidarity and to seek support ahead of the general elections.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
