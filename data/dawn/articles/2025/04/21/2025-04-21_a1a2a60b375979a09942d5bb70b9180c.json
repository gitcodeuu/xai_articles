The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said it “strongly urges the state to avoid taking excessive steps to curb dissent”.\n\nThe Balochistan National Party-Mengal started a “long march” from Wadh to Quetta on March 28 to protest the arrests of BYC leaders and activists, including Mahrang and Sammi Deen Baloch, who was released on April 1. The sit-in concluded on April 16, with the party announcing it would launch a public outreach movement instead.",
