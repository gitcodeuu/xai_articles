It continued that the remaining terrorists fled the scene.\n\nThe authorities recovered a sub-machine gun, a rocket launcher and two motorcycles from the assailants.\n\nAs per the statement, the slain terrorist was identified as “Afnan, who was carrying two identity cards, three ATM cards and a smartphone”.\n\nIt added that one of the recovered cards belonged to the terrorist, but the other one belonged to a police constable, who was martyred in an attack before Eidul Fitr. The constable’s case had been registered at the CTD police station in South Waziristan.\n\n“Additional personnel and armoured personnel carriers have been dispatched to investigate the area and protect polio teams,” the statement read.\n\n“KP IGP Zulfiqar Hameed has congratulated the police team and announced a reward,” it concluded.\n\nMilitant violence and security operations intensified in the country in March, with the number of militant attacks surpassing 100 for the first time since November 2014, according to a report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.\n\nPakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.",
