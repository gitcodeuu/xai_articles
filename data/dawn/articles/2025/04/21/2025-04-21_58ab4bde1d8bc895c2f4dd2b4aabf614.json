  "content": "SYLHET: Zimbabwe finished the first day of the first Test in a commanding position at 67-0 after an inspired bowling performance dismissed Bangladesh for 191 runs on Sunday.\n\nThe visitors’ opening pair of Brian Bennett, unbeaten on 40 off 37 balls, and Ben Curran (17) took the attack to Bangladesh’s bowlers in the 14.1 overs they faced before bad light stopped play.\n\nBangladesh skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto, who scored 40, earlier won the toss and opted to bat first on a pace-friendly wicket.\n\nBut his batters failed to capitalise on the decision and none of them, including top-scorer Mominul Haque (56) or Jakir Ali, who made 28, were able to turn good starts into decent Test scores.\n\nThe Zimbabwe attack bowled aggressive and disciplined lines, with paceman Blessing Muzarabani and left-arm orthodox Wellington Masakadza both taking three wickets each.\n\nThey were assisted by Victor Nyauchi and Wessley Madhevere, who shared the other four wickets.\n\nNyauchi set the tone for the visitors, sending back Bangladesh’s openers early in the first session with only 32 runs on the board.\n\nShadman Islam was the first to fall for 12 in the ninth over, with Nyauchi also removing Mahmudul Hasan Joy (14) in his next over.\n\nA third-wicket partnership of 66 runs between Mominul and Najmul gave the home team’s score some respectability.\n\nBangladesh’s relatively inexperienced pace attack of Hasan Mahmud, Nahid Rana and Khalid Rana couldn’t find their lines against Bennett, who hit six fours.\n\nTrailing only by 124 runs, Zimbabwe have a rare opportunity to set a formidable first innings total with the pitch expected to be better for the batters on the second day.\n\nBangladesh are ranked ninth and Zimbabwe are at the bottom of the 12-team ICC Test rankings after a disappointing year and both teams are hoping for a better start to the long season ahead.\n\nThe hosts have been formidable on the slow and spin-friendly home pitches but have several veterans missing.\n\nThe second and final Test of the series will be played in Chattogram from April 28.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nBANGLADESH (1st Innings):\n\nMahmudul Hasan c Mayavo b Nyauchi 14\n\nShadman Islam c Bennett b Nyauchi 12\n\nMominul Haque c Madhevere b Masakadza 56\n\nNajmul Hossain c Madhevere b Muzarabani 40\n\nMushfiqur Rahim c Bennett b Masakadza 4\n\nJaker Ali c Curran b Madhevere 28\n\nMehidy Hasan c Mayavo b Muzarabani 1\n\nTaijul Islam c Mayavo b Masakadza 3\n\nHasan Mahmud b Muzarabani 19\n\nKhaled Ahmed not out 4\n\nNahid Rana b Madhevere 0\n\nEXTRAS (B-3, LB-4, NB-3) 10\n\nTOTAL (all out, 61 overs) 191\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-31 (Shadman), 2-32 (Mahmud), 3-98 (Najmul), 4-123 (Mushfiqur), 5-136 (Mominul), 6-137 (Mehidy), 7-146 (Taijul), 8-187 (Hasan), 9-191 (Jaker)\n\nBOWLING: Ngarava 14-2-37-0, Muzarabani 19-4-50-3 (2nb), Nyauchi 15-2-74-2 (1nb), Madhevere 3-2-2-2, Masakadza 10-4-21-3\n\nZIMBABWE (1st Innings):\n\nB.
