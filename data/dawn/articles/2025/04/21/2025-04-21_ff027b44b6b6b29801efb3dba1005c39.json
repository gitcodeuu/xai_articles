Their ambulances and other vehicles were also buried alongside them.\n\n‘Frustration’\n\nSeparately, Qatar’s chief negotiator voiced frustration over talks for a truce in Gaza in an interview with AFP, a month after Israel resumed its strikes on the Palestinian territory and another round of negotiations ended without a deal.\n\n“We’re definitely frustrated by the slowness, sometimes, of the process in the negotiation. This is an urgent matter. There are lives at stake here if this military operation continues day by day,” Mohammed Al-Khulaifi said on Friday.\n\nQatar, with the United States and Egypt, brokered a truce in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, which came into force on January 19.\n\nThe initial phase of the truce ended in early March, with the two sides unable to agree on the next steps.\n\nLate on Thursday, Hamas signalled the group would not accept Israel’s newest proposal for a 45-day ceasefire.\n\nIsrael had wanted the release of 10 living hostages held by the Palestinian group, Hamas said.\n\n“We’ve been working continuously in the last days to try to bring the parties together and revive the agreement that has been endorsed by the two sides,” the Qatari minister of state said.\n\n“And we will remain committed to this, in spite of the difficulties,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
