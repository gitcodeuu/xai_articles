Chief executive Adam Weir advised patrolled beaches should be prioritised for safety.\n\n“We know that Aussies and visitors to our country like to go off the beaten track to enjoy camping, fishing and other coastal activities,” Weir said in a statement.\n\n“But these coastal locations can present dangers, some that you can see and some that you can’t, which is why we have some simple advice: Stop, Look, Stay Alive.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
