  "content": "PESHAWAR: As a government convoy carrying life-saving drugs — facilitated and escorted by a local tribe — reached Parachinar on Sunday, fresh details about the deaths of three people in the Bagan area of Lower Kurram have cast events leading to their killings in a new light, authorities said.\n\nOn Friday, three men were said to be killed by gunmen while others were missing from a group making its way from Parac­hinar to Peshawar. Although initial reports suggested the men had been travelling as part of a convoy, police officials told Dawn on Sunday that the men were trying to reach Thall by walking along the riverbank at night.\n\n“Men from the local watch, deputed to ward off any possible attack, fired at those approaching and killed them. They were not part of any convoy… They [were travelling] on their own at grave risk to their lives,” a police official said.\n\nThe official said that local tribes had been conveyed that no movement should be allowed at night, which may cause confusion and lead to inadvertent consequences.\n\nLocals facilitate convoy carrying life-saving drugs to Parachinar\n\n“What happened was unfortunate, but giving it a twist and distorting the facts is even more unfortunate and an attempt to spoil the peace process,” the official said.\n\nA video circulating on social media seems to further corroborate this version of events, as the three men could be seen moving along the riverbank in a suspicious manner. At least one of them was said to be armed.\n\nSeparately, the Watizaye committee in coordination with Kurram police, assumed responsibility for ensuring the safety of a convoy of life-saving drugs comprising 32 vehicles, which reached Parachinar over the weekend.\n\n“This collaborative effort highlights the growing trust and cooperation between local communities, the district admi­n­istration and the Kurram Police”, Regional Police Officer Abbas Majeed Marwat told Dawn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
