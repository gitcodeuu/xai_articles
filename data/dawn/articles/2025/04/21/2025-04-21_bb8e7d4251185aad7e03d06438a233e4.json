  "content": "A rare caracal (wild cat) was spotted in the Cholistan Desert of Rahim Yar Khan on Monday, wildlife officials said.\n\nRahim Yar Khan Assistant Chief Wildlife Ranger Mujahid Kalim told Dawn.com he “sighted the caracal at 7:30am while roaming near a cluster of rare Chankara deer to hunt them.”\n\nKalim recorded the first video in Punjab.\n\nThe caracal — among the beautiful and rare cats — is considered an expert on hunting desert animals, especially rabbits, birds, rats and deer by flying up to 9.8 feet. They typically give birth to one to six kittens.\n\nAccording to the wildlife ranger, Cholistan is considered its a natural habitat.\n\nThe caracal is a medium-sized wild cat native to Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, and arid areas of Pakistan and northwestern India. It is characterised by a robust build, long legs, a short face, long tufted ears, relatively short tail, and long canine teeth.\n\nIts coat is uniformly reddish tan or sandy, while the ventral parts are lighter with small reddish markings. It reaches 40–50 centimetres at the shoulder and weighs eight to 19 kilograms.\n\nThe cat was first scientifically described by German naturalist Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber in 1776 according to Wikipedia.",
