Tens of thousands of researchers and engineers from 312 domestic institutes, enterprises and universities took part in the program. Construction of the first prototype began in March 2014 and was completed in July 2016.\n\nThe AG600 made its maiden flight in December 2017 in Zhuhai in South China’s Guangdong province, taking off and landing at an airport. Ten months later, it carried out the first water-based takeoff and landing on the Zhanghe Reservoir in Jingmen, Central China’s Hubei province.\n\nIn July 2020, the seaplane conducted its first sea-based test flight over the Yellow Sea.\n\nOver the past several years, four prototypes have been built to undertake various kinds of tests across the country to verify the flying boat’s capabilities and compliance with airworthiness standards.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
