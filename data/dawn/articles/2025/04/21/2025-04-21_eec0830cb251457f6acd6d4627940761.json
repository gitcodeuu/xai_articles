Shah Faisal Colony police acting SHO Abdul Ghani said 18-year-old Athar Ali was riding the bike when he was injured in an accident near the Data restaurant.\n\n“He was taken to a private hospital where doctors pronounced him dead,” the SHO said, adding that the body was moved to JPMC for legal formalities.\n\nThe officer said it was definitely an accident, but it was being ascertained whether any vehicle had hit him.\n\nIn pursuance of the continued efforts of the provincial government to control the menace of accidents in Karachi, the city administration last week extended the complete ban imposed on heavy vehicles in the city during daytime for another two months.\n\nA total of nine dumpers and water tankers were set on fire by angry mobs on April 9 near the main road leading to 4-K Chowrangi after a heavy vehicle hit a bike rider.",
