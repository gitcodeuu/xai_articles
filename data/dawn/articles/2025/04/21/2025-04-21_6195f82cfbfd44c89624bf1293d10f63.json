  "content": "KARACHI: As Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab on Sunday extended Easter greetings to the Christian community, dozens of Christian workers of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) staged a protest outside the Karachi Press Club (KPC), condemning the non-payment of salaries and pensions even on the occasion of their religious festival.\n\nA special Easter prayer service was also held at the protest site to observe the religious significance of the day.\n\nThe protest was organised by the Municipal Workers Trade Unions Alliance, which accused the Sindh finance department of deliberately delaying salary and pension payments despite clear legal and administrative obligations.\n\nSpeaking to the protesters, senior lawyer Saleem Michael, Alliance president Syed Zulfiqar Shah, and others stated that, as per regulations, if a festival falls after the 15th of a month, salaries and pensions must be paid in advance.\n\nHowever, the Sindh finance department issued a notification and released only 50 per cent of overtime allowances on the last working day.\n\nThey alleged that despite being notified in writing 10 days in advance, the KMC and several TMCs deliberately failed to prepare salary and pension bills. As a result, thousands of Christian employees did not receive their advance salaries, and nearly 8,000 Christian pensioners were left without their pensions before Easter.\n\nEarlier, in his message, the mayor said that Easter symbolises sacrifice, harmony, and compassion for humanity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
