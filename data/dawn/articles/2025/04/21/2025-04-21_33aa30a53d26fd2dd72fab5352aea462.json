  "content": "US Vice President JD Vance met with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi after a red carpet welcome in New Delhi on Monday, as India bids for an early trade deal to stave off punishing tariffs.\n\nModi’s office said that there had been “significant progress in the negotiations” with the two countries negotiating the first tranche of a trade deal.\n\nNew Delhi hopes to secure relief within the 90-day pause on tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump this month.\n\nVance’s four-day visit comes two months after Modi held talks at the White House with Trump, who unveiled 26 per cent tariffs on India.\n\nAn honour guard and troupes of folk dancers greeted Vance after he stepped out into the sweltering sunshine of New Delhi on Monday morning, the start of a four-day tour that will include trips to the historic fort city of Jaipur and the Taj Mahal.\n\n“Ad-Vance-ing” US-India ties, broadcaster NDTV headlined its stories.\n\nModi welcomed Vance to his residence on Monday evening with a bear hug, photographs released by the Indian government showed, and later hosted Vance and his family for dinner.\n\nThe men discussed boosting “cooperation in energy, defence, strategic technologies and other areas”, Modi’s office said, without giving further details.\n\nVance’s visit comes during an escalating trade war between the United States and China. India’s neighbour and rival faces US levies of up to 145pc on many products. Beijing has responded with duties of 125pc on US goods. New Delhi has reacted cautiously so far.\n\nIndia’s Department of Commerce said after the tariffs were announced, it was “carefully examining the implications”, adding it was “also studying the opportunities that may arise”.\n\nThe two leaders were also expected to discuss China, seen as a challenger in different domains by both governments. The two democracies are also a part of the “Quad” group with Australia and Japan.\n\nThe US vice president is accompanied by his wife Usha, the daughter of Indian immigrants. Together with their three children, dressed in traditional flowing Indian attire, they visited the Hindu Akshardham Temple in New Delhi.\n\nModi said during his visit to Washington that the world’s largest and fifth-largest economies would work on a “mutually beneficial trade agreement”.\n\nThe United States is a crucial market for India’s information technology and services sectors, but Washington in turn has made billions of dollars in new military hardware sales to New Delhi in recent years.\n\nModi said he “looks forward” to a visit by Trump to India later this year, New Delhi said in a statement, with a potential Quad summit slated.\n\nVance, 40, a devout Catholic convert, arrived in New Delhi a day after meeting Pope Francis in the Vatican.\n\nThe vice president said his “heart goes out to the millions of Christians all over the world who loved him”, after the Vatican announced the death of the pope on Monday.",
