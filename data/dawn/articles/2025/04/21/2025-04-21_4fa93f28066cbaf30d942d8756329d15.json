Nearly a dozen non-tax-paying cigarette factories — primarily in Mirpur and Bhimber — were also shut down, despite pressure and interim relief from courts.\n\n“Ask the Pakistan Tobacco Company how much their revenue has increased after this action—it’s a matter of billions,” he said, adding that around 200 individuals in the cigarette industry had long evaded taxes.\n\nHe also claimed that many ‘ghost’ and illegal tea production units were identified and closed, saving the national exchequer billions. Subsidised wheat flour smuggling was curbed through the sealing of undeclared warehouses.\n\n“Despite a Rs71bn deficit, we are standing on our own feet,” the prime minister said. “Visit and see for yourself before passing criticism.”\n\nMr Haq maintained that he draws no salary or privileges and is ready to step down if his opponents musters 27 lawmakers. “I do not draw a salary, nor have I availed any privileges. I am ready to return in the same clothes I came in,” he said.\n\nAddressing the fiscal challenges, he said his government cleared Rs12bn in development liabilities, allocated Rs4bn for the conversion of the Bank of AJK into a scheduled bank, and launched special packages for the health and education sectors.\n\nHe added that Rs20bn was earmarked for road infrastructure and Rs3bn was saved through e-tendering. “I did not purchase a new vehicle and surrendered my own budget,” he said. “We overcame a major crisis by cutting unnecessary expenditures and enhancing revenues. Allah gave us the strength to deal with it.”\n\nOn development, Mr Haq highlighted that the Muzaffarabad and Mirpur cardiac hospitals were operationalized under his government, with procedures such as stenting available at half the cost compared to Islamabad. The budget for medicines was also doubled.\n\nTurning to the Kashmir issue, Mr Haq praised Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir for his “unambiguous position” on the matter.\n\n“I have met him only once in the past two years, but his unambiguous position on the Kashmir issue... has set things on the path to improvement,” he said.\n\nMr Haq said the struggle for freedom in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir continues despite ongoing brutalities. “Indian brutalities continue unabated in occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.\n\n“Movements go through ups and downs, but the current army chief, while sitting in Muzaffarabad, categorically stated that we have fought three wars over Kashmir and are ready for seven more. With such resolve, there is no room for despair.”\n\nReferring to the right of resistance under the UN Charter, Mr Haq said nations have the right to use military force in self-defence if war is imposed or human rights are violated by a member state.\n\n“Azad Kashmir is the base camp of the freedom movement. It is our duty to continue political, moral, diplomatic and military support to the oppressed people of occupied Kashmir,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 21st, 2025",
