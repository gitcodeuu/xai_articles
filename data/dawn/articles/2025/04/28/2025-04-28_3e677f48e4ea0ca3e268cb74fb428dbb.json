It shocked the country’s leaders, with Macron finally speaking out on X on Sunday.\n\n“Racism and hatred based on religion can have no place in France. Freedom of worship cannot be violated,” he wrote, offering support to “our fellow Muslim citizens”.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Francois Bayrou earlier branded it an “Islamophobic atrocity” — although the prosecutor in the case emphasised that Islamophobia is just one of the motives being considered. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said in televised comments on Sunday that he had ordered police to tighten security at mosques around the country.\n\nHundreds also rallied in Paris, where far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon accused the government of nurturing a “climate of Islamophobia” at a time when immigration is top of the political agenda. Retailleau accused Melenchon’s party of exploiting the attack for political ends.\n\nInvestigators said the alleged killer sent the video he had filmed with his phone — showing the victim writhing in agony — to another person, who then shared it on a social media platform before deleting it.\n\nA source close to the case said the suspected perpetrator, while not apprehended, had been identified as a French citizen of Bosnian origin who is not a Muslim. After initially praying alongside the man when they were alone in the mosque, the attacker stabbed the victim up to 50 times before fleeing the scene.\n\nThe body of the victim was discovered later.\n\nThe French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM) said it was “horrified” by the “anti-Muslim terrorist attack” and urged Muslims in France to be “extremely vigilant”.\n\n“The murder of a worshipper in a mosque is a despicable crime that must revolt the hearts of all French people,” added the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF).\n\nThe attacker has been named only as Olivier A., born in France in 2004 and unemployed without a criminal record. He is “potentially extremely dangerous” and it is “essential” to arrest him before he claims more victims, said regional prosecutor Abdelkrim Grini.\n\nBut while the motive of Islamophobia is the lead that the 70 investigators are “working on as a priority… it is not the only one”, Grini said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
