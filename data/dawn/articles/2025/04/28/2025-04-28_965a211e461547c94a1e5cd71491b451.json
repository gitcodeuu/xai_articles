PPP is our ally in the federal government, and we were also partners during the PDM-led government,” he said.\n\n“There should be flexibility in our approach, and we must move discussions forward,” he said.\n\nDr Sattar also highlighted the need to revisit the past agreements between the PPP and the MQM.\n\nHe stressed the importance of continued informal dialogue on key issues such as water scarcity, constitutional amendments and the local government act. “Karachi’s issues require collective focus, and we must sit together regularly to find solutions,” he said.\n\nHe told reporters that the MQM-P filed nominations of Nighat Shakeel and Mujahid Baig for the Senate by-election. “We have received a formal request from the PPP. Our central committee, under the leadership of Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, will deliberate and finalise this matter,” he said.\n\nTo a question, Nasir Shah said: “If the decision regarding the six canals project on the Indus River is not reversed at the May 2 meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI), the PPP will consider parting ways with the federal government.”\n\n“We are not in the coalition with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz by choice, but out of necessity for the sake of Pakistan. The canals issue is highly sensitive and that the party cannot back down on this matter,” he said.\n\nHe reiterated that PPP had always advocated for development and cooperation. He acknowledged the visible progress in development work.\n\nHe also thanked MQM-P leader Mustafa Kamal for acknowledging that Karachi received federal funding during Asif Ali Zardari’s tenure. “This meeting is a gesture of goodwill and a step toward strengthening ties between our two parties,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
