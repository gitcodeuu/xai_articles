It is jointly performed by Pakistan’s Punjab Rangers and India’s Border Security Force.\n\nThe drill involves synchronised stomps, high-kicks, and theatrical standoffs between soldiers and ends with a coordinated lowering of the flags and a handshake between soldiers.\n\nOver recent days, Pakistan and India have downgraded ties, traded fire at the Line of Control and suspended trade following the Pahalgam shooting, which claimed the lives of over two dozen tourists.\n\nWith India baying for blood following the terror attack and Pakistan paying back in the same coin, the public present at the Wagah ceremony were visibly roused.\n\n“Today, I have come to witness the parade, especially to see the spirit of our soldiers… I am happy to see not only that the soldiers have high spirits but the public present here is backing up the armed forces in the face of any possible misadventure by India,” Sikandar Sultan, who was visiting from Lahore, said.\n\nAli Asad, who was accompanied by friends, said this was not his first time visiting the border for this ceremony.\n\n“…a friend of mine who visited yesterday here told me that it is going on as usual, rather more passionately. I had been here before, but today I enjoyed it more because of the fervent involvement of the fellow visitors,” he said.\n\n“India should learn from the past and come out of the war mentality. It should talk to Pakistan to resolve the issues between the two countries, and that is the only feasible solution,” he told Dawn.\n\nOn the other side of the border, Indians were as ardent. “It just fills you with passion and patriotic pride”, Simarjeet Singh, 17, from the nearby Indian city of Amritsar, told AFP news agency.\n\n“There were people from all over who looked and dressed different but were cheering and screaming at the same time — for our country and the soldiers,” Mr Singh said, who came with his friends from college.\n\nKT Ramesh, 57, from Kozhikode in the southern state of Kerala, told AFP that even the scaled-down ceremony “was worth it”. “There was no shortage of passion among our people,” he said.\n\nHe said that he’d “seen anger” about the attack in Kashmir “in whoever I spoke with, from our hotel staff to the taxi driver and other tourists here”.\n\n“We don’t like a war but this time we must teach them a lesson,” he told AFP.\n\nInterestingly, some foreigners were also present at the ceremony on both sides.\n\nWith input from AFP news agency\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025\n\nHeader image: Rangers personnel examine the documents of a man crossing back from India moments before the closing ceremony; while (right) a BSF officer checks the passport of Pakistani citizens as they prepare to leave India. — Photo by the writer / Reuters",
