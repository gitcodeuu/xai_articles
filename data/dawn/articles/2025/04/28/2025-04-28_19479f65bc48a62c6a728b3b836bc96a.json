About one minute after the small fire and smoke become visible, a fireball erupts as vehicles pass nearby, with men running for their lives.\n\nPresident Masoud Pezeshkian visited hospitals treating the wounded on Sunday in the nearby city of Bandar Abbas.\n\nSince the explosion, authorities have ordered all schools and offices in the area closed, and have urged residents to avoid going outside “until further notice” and to use protective masks.\n\nThe New York Times quoted a person with ties to Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss security matters, as saying that what exploded was sodium perchlorate — a major ingredient in solid fuel for missiles.\n\nDefence ministry spokesman Reza Talaei-Nik later told state TV that “there has been no imported or exported cargo for military fuel or military use in the area”.\n\nIran’s ally Russia has dispatched specialists to help battle the blazes.\n\nAuthorities have declared Monday a national day of mourning, while three days of mourning began Sunday in Hormozgan province, where the port is located.\n\nThe blast occurred as Iranian and US delegations were meeting in Oman for high-level talks on Tehran’s nuclear programme, with both sides reporting progress.\n\nWhile Iranian authorities so far appear to be treating the blast as an accident, it also comes against the backdrop of years of shadow war with regional foe Israel. According to The Washington Post, Israel launched a cyberattack targeting the Shahid Rajaee Port in 2020.",
