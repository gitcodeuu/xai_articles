  "content": "RAWALPINDI: To end the water shortage in the cantonment areas of Rawalpindi and Chaklala in the coming months, the government is working to construct modern underground tanks with a capacity of one million gallons per day (mgd) to ensure an uninterrupted supply of water.\n\nPML-N Divisional President and MNA Malik Ibrar Ahmed said that these projects would provide a lasting solution to the long-standing problem of water shortage in the cantonment areas. He said this will not only improve the water supply but also help overcome the shortage that arises during the summer season.\n\nHe said that the construction work on the storage facility was in the final stages, adding that the work would likely be completed by next month. He said that federal and provincial governments gave special grants to improve water supply projects in the cantonment areas. These projects aim to provide a lasting solution, ensuring improved supply and overcoming the seasonal scarcity, especially during the summer months.\n\n“Rawalpindi and Chaklala Cantonment areas face severe water shortages at the outset of summer every year. The main reason for this shortage is the lack of water storage facilities at the local level,” he said.\n\nPML-N leader says work will complete next month, reveals Rs85m being spent to fix watersupply, sewerage\n\nHe said that the work was progressing rapidly on underground tanks at Bhatta Chowk with a storage capacity of 200,000 gallons per day and at Gawalmandi, with a capacity of 100,000 gallons per day.\n\nAdditionally, he said that projects are underway at Naseerabad, Barf Khana Chowk, Ghazi Abad, Afshan Colony, Tench Bhatta, Tahli Mohri, and Wards 7, 8, 9, and 10 of Chaklala Cantonment, each designed to store 50,000 gallons daily. These tanks are expected to be completed by next month, after which 100 per cent water supply coverage in these areas would likely be achieved.\n\nIn response to a question, Malik Abrar Ahmad mentioned that some of the water storage projects were being executed by the public health engineering teams, while others are being managed by the cantonment board teams, working round the clock to complete them. He further informed that Rs85 million are being invested to install a new water supply system and sewerage lines, significantly improving water distribution and drainage systems in the area.\n\nHe said that PML-N would continue to solve the problems of the people of the cantonment as per the promises made during the national and local government elections in the cantonment areas. He said that the people of the cantonment were the priority of the PML-N and it would continue to spend more funds in the area.\n\nAccording to Wasa, the agency has three water supply sources, including Rawal Dam and Khanpur Dam, besides tube wells. These sources supply 51 million gallons per day (mgd) of water to the city, while the demand is 70mgd.\n\nLast year in March, the Water and Sanitation Agency with the cooperation of UN Habitat launched a Rs150 million project for rainwater harvesting in 30 public buildings, the metro elevated road and public parks in the garrison city. A senior official of Wasa had said that under the project, water tanks would be constructed in government buildings and parks to cope with water shortage and reduce flooding.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
