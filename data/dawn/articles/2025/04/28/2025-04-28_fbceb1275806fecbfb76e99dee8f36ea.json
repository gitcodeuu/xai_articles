  "content": "LAHORE: A recent report compiled by the Punjab chief minister’s Special Monitoring Unit (SMU) has exposed irregularities, including corruption, misconduct, misbehaviour, abuse of power and a lack of response to public complaints etc, by the provincial police, questioning their tall claims of redressing grievances of people.\n\nIt reveals how inefficiency and corruption at the police station level were not only undermining the CM’s initiatives aimed to provide relief to the people, but also eroding the public trust in the government.\n\nThe eight-page SMU report submitted to the chief minister was prepared in light of the record of cases and feedback by the complainants approaching various police stations in different districts of Punjab.\n\nThe SMU report also recommends appropriate action against the guilty officials for “shaking the public trust in the government” and “cheating” the CM’s initiatives meant for public relief.\n\nThe report, being termed a charge sheet against the Punjab police, gathered data of the calls made by complainants to the officials of their respective police stations to get their issues resolved and the response by the police.\n\n“In line with the CM’s vision to enhance governance and public service delivery, the objective of the SMU was to foster transparency, ensure accountability, and advance citizen-centric initiatives”, reads the report.\n\nUnder the CM’s initiative, the report stated, the SMU conducted an analysis of the 3,216 ‘connected calls’ of the complainants of the FIRs and compiled the detailed report based on feedback received from the citizens of various districts.\n\nAs per the analysis, 1,550 of these callers reported multiple complaints to the SMU with regard to their experience.\n\nThe unit compiled a complete record of the callers, including names, addresses, mobile phone numbers, the districts, police stations, the FIRs they lodged and the issues each of them faced on contacting the respective police officials to seek their help.\n\n“The primary issues highlighted included delays in service delivery, lack of responsiveness from concerned authorities/police officials, bribery and inadequate resolution of complaints,” reads the report.\n\n“Such actions undermine public trust in law enforcement and raise concerns about the ethical standards maintained within the police force”, reads the report.\n\nThe SMU said many allegations have also surfaced regarding officers demanding bribes for just carrying out their duties. It accuses a superintendent of police (SP) of ‘accepting money from a party’.\n\nThe report says the SMU has been continuously tracking the progress on the implementation of the initiatives taken by the CM.\n\nIn some cases, it said, law enforcement officials have been accused of deliberately manipulating investigations for personal financial gain, thereby obstructing the course of justice and allowing unlawful activities.\n\nIt says that in numerous instances, police officers exhibited negligence, failing in giving a timely response to complaints. This included unjustified delays in addressing grievances, refusal to conduct necessary raids, and an overall lack of action in critical cases, which led to further distress and insecurity among the affected individuals.\n\nThe SMU also accused police officers of siding with influential individuals, rather than upholding justice impartially.\n\nIn many cases, it mentions, complaints have reportedly been ignored, and victims have been pressured into settling disputes instead of receiving the legal protection and recourse to which they are entitled.\n\n“In some cases where the stolen amount has been recovered, it has been alleged that the police retained a portion of the recovered money and returned only a partial amount to the complainant,” the SMU report says.\n\nIt points out that the tracking of stolen mobile phones was reportedly initiated by police only upon “payment of a fee” by the complainant. It also mentions that the police response in mobile phone theft cases remains notably low.\n\nIt also points out individual cases from various districts. It says the officials posted at Sadar JPJ police station of Gujrat district demanded Rs100,000 from a complainant to resolve his issue, while a Kunjah police station official in the same district also demanded bribes from a citizen.\n\nSimilarly, it says that Dolat Nagar and Civil Lines police stations officials in Gujrat refused to accommodate complainants. It levels similar allegations against the SHOs of the Dinga and Gulyana police stations.\n\nIn Sialkot district, the SMU says, an official posted at Ugoki police station demanded Rs10,000 from a man for providing tracking-related assistance.\n\nIn Nankana Sahib district, an official at the Warburton police station allegedly pressured the complainant for reconciliation with the rival party.\n\nThe SMU also highlighted the case of a police official posted at the Airport police station of Rawalpindi, stating he demanded Rs400,000 from a citizen to lodge his FIR.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
