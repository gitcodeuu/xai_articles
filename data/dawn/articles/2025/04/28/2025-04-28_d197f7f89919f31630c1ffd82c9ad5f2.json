  "content": "TORONTO: Eleven people were killed and 20 others injured after a vehicle drove into a crowd during a street festival celebrating Filipino culture in Vancouver on Saturday evening, police confirmed.\n\nThe incident occurred around 8pm local time as the Lapu Lapu Day Block Party, attended by 100,000, was wrapping up. Police said a 30-year-old man from Vancouver, known to police in prior contexts, was arrested at the scene after being apprehended by bystanders.\n\nAuthorities said the suspect drove a black SUV through a bustling section of the festival, striking numerous people before coming to a stop. Interim Police Chief Steve Rai said victims were transported to multiple hospitals, but refrained from speculating on the final injury count, citing respect for the families and the investigation.\n\nPolice said “at this time” they are confident this was not an act of terrorism and that the major crime section is leading the investigation.\n\nEyewitnesses described scenes of chaos as the vehicle barrelled through food stalls and vendor tents.\n\nVideos circulated online showed emergency crews attempting resuscitation efforts on multiple victims, while debris and personal belongings lay scattered across the street.\n\nAmong the dead was at least one child, according to initial police reports. The driver’s motivations remain unclear.\n\nVancouver Mayor Ken Sim said he was “shocked and deeply saddened” by the tragedy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
