The first one in Jerez is something amazing,” said Alex, who celebrated his 29th birthday earlier this week. “I cannot ask for more. It was a race where I was really clever in all the movements.”\n\nAn action-packed opening lap had polesitter Quartararo get a perfect start off the line to take the lead into turn one while Saturday’s sprint winner Marc fell behind to fourth place.\n\nAlex attempted to overtake three riders in front of him early on by threading the needle between bikes, but he braked too late and fell behind, while Marc and Bagnaia collided while jostling for position.\n\nWith Marc running in third and looking to overtake his team-mate, the Spaniard then crashed at turn seven and rejoined in 22nd place with a damaged bike as thousands of fans around the circuit collectively groaned.\n\nBagnaia did not have time to relax, however, as Alex came up behind him and elbowed the Italian out of the way to move up to second and put Quartararo in his sights.\n\nThe Yamaha rider tried his best to keep Alex at bay, but on lap 11, the pace of the Ducati bike proved far too superior as he overtook Quartararo to draw a roar from the Marquez Grandstand.\n\nOnce Alex was in the clear, he began to disappear into the distance while Bagnaia could not catch up as he struggled to overtake Quartararo, who doggedly held on to second place.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
