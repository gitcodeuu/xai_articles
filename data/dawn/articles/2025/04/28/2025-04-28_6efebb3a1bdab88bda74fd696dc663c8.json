He urged lawyers to remain peaceful and assured them that no action would be taken against those protesting peacefully.\n\nEight hurt in Karachi\n\nIn Karachi, eight people, including two policemen and a lawyer, were injured and a police vehicle was set on fire in Gulshan-i-Hadeed on Sunday after a police party clashed with members of the legal fraternity in order to end their five-day sit-in against the canals project, according to officials and witnesses.\n\nA participant in the Karachi sit-in said that early in the morning, when only a few protesters had gathered on the road linking the National Highway with the Superhighway near Gulshan-i-Hadeed, the police took the action, resulting in injuries to one lawyer and detention of several protesters.\n\n“The police removed the tents set up for the sit-in and cleared the road for vehicular traffic. However, lawyers and political workers mobilised their supporters through social media, urging them to join the protest,” he said.\n\n“Over 200 protesters resumed the sit-in, blocking the link road again,” he added.\n\nSources said that some lawyers visited the Steel Town police station and met Malir SSP Kashif Abbasi, who informed them that the government had decided to open the highways and roads and remove the protesters.\n\nDIG-East Usman Ghani told Dawn: “The police were removing tents blocking the main road in Gulshan-i-Hadeed for the past several days when they came under an attack by a lawyer, injuring a policeman.”\n\nThe police retaliated in which the attacker was injured.\n\nThe officer added that the police “dislodged the tents from the road and registered an FIR against the violent members of the crowd”.\n\nHe said that the police and Rangers were deployed at the site. However, later on the police also came under stone pelting and baton charge by a mob, the officer claimed. Responding to a question, DIG Ghani confirmed that six protesters had been detained, who were injured. “We sent them to hospital for treatment.”\n\nHe clarified that no one was in police custody, but an FIR was being registered against them.\n\nMeanwhile, Steel Town SHO Allan Khan Abbasi told Dawn: “One policeman was injured in the morning while another was injured in the afternoon. “A police mobile was torched by the mob,” he claimed.\n\nRescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Khan told Dawn that when the riot police attempted to disperse the protesters, they set the police mobile alight.\n\n“It was completely destroyed by the time firefighters reached the scene,” Hassan said. “The remains of the torched vehicle were also destroyed by the mob.”\n\nAction in Kandhkot\n\nSeveral protesters fainted when police fired shots and tear gas at protesters who had blocked the road at the Gola-Mor (turning) along Kandhkot Bypass on Sunday morning.\n\nThe police took the action to clear the road after long queues of Punjab-bound heavy vehicles were formed on the highway.\n\nAccording to detail, the sit-in organised by the Lawyers’ Alliance and the All Parties Movement against the construction of the canals continued on the ninth day.\n\nLate in the night, a police party fired shots and used tear gas to disperse the protesters.\n\nFour protesters, including the district bar president and leader of the sit-in Abdul Ghani Bijarani fainted due to heavy tear-gas shelling. However, the police left the area when lawyers and nationalists’ parties workers did not clear the road and continued the sit-in.\n\nWhen the news spread that the police were preparing to take another action against the protesters, a large number of nationalist parties’ workers and activists, carrying clubs and sticks, joined the protect sit-in.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
