He added that ministers only hold symbolic titles while actual decisions were “made by the establishment”.\n\nMr Mengal accused major political parties of focusing solely on securing power, signing blank agreements without any regard for the people. Once in power, he said, these parties completely neglect the public in favour of repaying their benefactors.\n\nHe added that after the ‘Aghaz-i-Haqooq-i-Balochistan’ package, Balochistan was only given “packages of corpses.”\n\nFormer BNP Senator Sana Baloch also spoke at the seminar, saying the ongoing struggle was essential for protecting future generations.\n\nHe criticised some political parties for merely expressing reservations over the Mines and Minerals Act instead of rejecting it outright, calling it an attempt to deceive and mislead the people.\n\nThe ex-senator said Balochistan needed a long and sustained legal and constitutional struggle in which lawyers must play a key role.\n\nMajid Shah Advocate, the Kech Bar Association president, Mr Mengal’s resistance through democratic struggle, including his long march and sit-in against unconstitutional and unlawful actions in Balochistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
