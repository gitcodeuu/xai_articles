The group will also identify new routes for running more bullet trains in Punjab.\n\nThe transport minister joined the meeting through video link, while Transport Secretary Imran Sikandar Baloch and P&D Secretary Asif Tufail were present.\n\nThe participants were briefed in detail about the rail network and condition of rail tracks by the railway authorities.\n\nMs Aurangzeb was quoted as saying that the upgrade of Lahore and Rawalpindi railway stations is also part of the project.\n\nExperts say the total cost of the project runs into multi-billion dollars and they wonder how the Punjab government will manage these huge funds.\n\nThey say the per kilometre cost of laying railway track for a fast train is between $40 and 50 million, meaning the total cost will be over $10 billion.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
