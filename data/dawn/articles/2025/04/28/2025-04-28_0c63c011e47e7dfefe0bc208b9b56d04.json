  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A former federal minister has said that India can no longer block the water of the Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas rivers after unilaterally suspending the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).\n\nThe treaty, signed in 1960, divided the waters of the six rivers of the Indus Basin between them, with India receiving the three eastern rivers (the Ravi, Beas, and Sutlej).\n\nMean­while, Pakistan obtained control of the three western rivers (Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab).\n\nMuhammad Ali Durrani, who served as information minister in Gen Pervez Musharraf’s cabinet, emphasised that rights to the three eastern rivers were granted to India under the IWT.\n\nWith the treaty now suspended, India has no legal claim over their waters, he added.\n\nHe urged the government to take steps to reclaim the water from the Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas rivers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
