This not only had an additional financial burden on the government exchequer but also hampered the career progression of other employees.\n\nThe latest measure is part of pension reforms the government has taken in hand to contain ever-increasing pension liabilities, a key requirement of the IMF programme.\n\nThe measure was initially announced by the then finance minister Ishaq Dar in the 2022-23 budget, but it could not be implemented until reannounced by Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb in last year’s budget before the IMF signed off a new programme.\n\nOne of the key decisions of these reforms — a contributory pension scheme for armed forces personnel — may be further delayed until 2026 despite a notification for its implementation with effect from June 2025, according to sources.\n\nIn September last year, the government notified the introduction of a contributory fund scheme for new entrants in the civil government and armed forces. In a notification, the Ministry of Finance said last year that federal government employees would contribute 10 per cent of their respective basic pay while the government would contribute 20pc of the basic pay of the employees.\n\nAccording to the Sept 3, 2024, notification, the scheme would apply to civil servants joining after July 1, 2024, and armed forces personnel appointed after July 1, 2025. The government has allocated Rs10 billion for the pension fund in the 2024-25 budget.\n\nThe scheme had been introduced on the advice of the international lending agencies, particularly the World Bank, to contain rising pension liabilities described as a “ticking bomb”. The new scheme does not apply to existing employees. The government believes the contribution pension fund would slow down the growth in pension liabilities in future budgets.\n\nThe federal government’s total expenditure for pensions has been estimated at Rs1.014 trillion for the current fiscal year, up from Rs821bn in FY24, up by almost 24pc in a single year. This included pension liabilities of the armed forces at Rs662bn for the current fiscal year, up from Rs563bn, showing an increase of about 18pc.\n\nOn the other hand, the pension expenditure of civilians has been budgeted at Rs220bn for the current year against Rs228bn last year, a reduction of 3.5pc.\n\nSubsequently, in January this year, the government notified further pension reforms, including abolishing multiple pensions and shifting future pensionable benefit calculations to an average of the past 24 months of salaries instead of the last pay drawn before retirement.\n\nIt had been notified that “in the event where a person becomes entitled to more than one pension, such person shall only be authorised to opt to draw one of the pensions”.\n\nThis was subject to the provision that “where a federal government employee becomes entitled to a pension, such federal government employee shall not be eligible to receive such pension”.\n\nHowever, certain quarters were still pushing for a salary for re-employment and one pension.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
