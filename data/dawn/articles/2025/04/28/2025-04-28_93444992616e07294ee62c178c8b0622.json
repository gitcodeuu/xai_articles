Who could better understand the issue than the UK, he said, referring to the region’s colonial past.\n\nHe accused Indian PM Narendra Modi of staging a political drama to save his skin, just as he had done after the Pulwama incident in 2019.\n\nCall with Iranian president\n\nSpeaking to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian on Saturday, the prime minister shared Pakistan’s position on India’s provocative actions, adding that Pakistan desired peace in the region and would welcome it if Iran also wanted to play a role in this regard.\n\nDuring their call, the two leaders exchanged views on recent developments in the region, a PM Office statement said. Both also extended invitations to each other to visit their respective countries.\n\nReferring to India’s unilateral decision on the Indus Water Treaty, PM Shehbaz said the use of water as a weapon was unacceptable and Pakistan would defend its right at all costs.\n\nThe PM said that Pakistan condemned terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, reaffirming that the country had no linkage, either direct or indirect, with the Pahalgam attack, adding that Islamabad was ready for a neutral investigation into the incident.\n\nPM Shehbaz also conveyed Pakistan’s condolences on the loss of precious lives in the tragic explosion at Bandar Abbas, which claimed dozens of the lives and left more than 500 people injured.\n\nPakistan stood with the brotherly people of Iran at this difficult hour and would extend all possible assistance, the PM said.\n\nSeparately, media reports suggested that PM Shehbaz Sharif had met his elder brother, PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif, at Jati Umrah on Sunday to brief him on the Pahalgam attack and its aftermath.\n\nHowever, there was no official word from the PM Office or PML-N circles in this regard.\n\nSyed Irfan Raza and our correspondent in Narowal also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 28th, 2025",
