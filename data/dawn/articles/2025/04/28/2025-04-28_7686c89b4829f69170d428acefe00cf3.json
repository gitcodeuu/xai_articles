Beyond crashes, explosions can stem from defective fuel tanks, overloaded tanks, faulty muffler systems sparking fires, or various other issues. Given that tankers transport highly flammable or hazardous materials, accidents are not unexpected.\n\nLast year, a man was killed while five others were injured in an oil tanker explosion in Karachi’s Shireen Jinnah Colony near the terminals of the 20-bus route. Police said some workers were welding under the oil tanker, which was empty of oil, but some gases had accumulated in it, leading to the explosion.\n\nIn 2017, 212 people were killed when a tanker carrying 40,000 litres of fuel overturned after trying to make a sharp turn while travelling from Karachi to Lahore on the main highway. The incident occurred when hundreds of residents of a nearby village gathered at the site of the overturned oil tanker to collect the leaking fuel.\n\nAccording to initial investigations, a cigarette was suspected to have caused the massive blaze that engulfed the people collecting the spilled fuel.",
