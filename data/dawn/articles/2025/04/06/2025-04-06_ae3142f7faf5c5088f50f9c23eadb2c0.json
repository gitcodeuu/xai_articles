  "content": "GILGIT: The Pakistan Customs, Gilgit-Baltistan region has has concluded its investigation into the smuggling of banned goods, including mobile phones and identified one of its officials and his brother as culprits.\n\nSubsequently, an FIR was registered against Upper Division Clerk Mohammad Abu Bakr and his brother, while the Customs authorities issued a show-cause notice to him before dismissal with a seven-day deadline as per rules.\n\nThe investigation was launched after Upper Division Clerk Abu Bakr along with his brother Abdul Rehman and Appraising Officer Hafiz Muhammad Nazim Butt met with an accident near Bisham city on their way to Islamabad on March 30 and police found 210 mobile phones and other banned items from their rented vehicle. A formal seizure report was also prepared and placed on official record.\n\nBoth Abu Bakr and Hafiz Nazim were serving at Sost Dry port, according to a press release issued on Friday by Pakistan Customs.\n\nIn the accident, Abu Bakr remained unhurt while Hafiz Nazim sustained serious injuries and was shifted to Islamabad’s Pims hospital where he is still under treatment.\n\nInvestigators found that Abu Bakr was actively facilitating the transportation of smuggled goods of his brother who was allegedly involved in smuggling and was present with him at the time of the accident.\n\nAs Abu Bakr’s involvement was confirmed, no further inquiry was required into his role, but the appraising officer’s role remains unclear as he is currently in ICU at Pims and unable to record a statement.\n\nThe authorities claimed that appropriate action would be taken against the appraising officer if he was found guilty, as his role would be determined during criminal proceedings.\n\nInitially, when GB traders and civil society members had alleged that “thousands of mobile phones seized at Sost Dry port were found from possession of the Custom officials”, Pakistan Customs denied the allegations and asserted that the mobile phones and other items had been purchased from the black market.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
