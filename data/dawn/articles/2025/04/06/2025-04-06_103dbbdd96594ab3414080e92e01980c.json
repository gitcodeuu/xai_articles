  "content": "LAHORE: In response to a meteorological department advisory forecasting 42 per cent below-normal rainfall from Sept 1, 2024, to Jan 15, 2025, signalling moderate drought conditions, the Punjab government on Saturday banned the establishment of new car washing stations across the province.\n\nAn order-cum-notification from the Environment Protection Agency (EPA), under the Environment Department, said that car washing stations consume substantial water—approximately 40 litres per wash.\n\nThe EPA warned that setting up new stations during an impending drought would strain Punjab’s already limited water resources, risking severe environmental and socio-economic fallout.\n\n“And whereas the Environment Protection Agency is mandated to anticipate and mitigate potential environmental hazards and ensure prudent use of natural resources for present and future generations, it is empowered under Section 6(1)(t) of the Punjab Environmental Protection Act-1997 to take necessary measures for environmental protection, pollution control, and sustainable development,” the order stated.\n\n“Now, therefore, I, Dr Imran Hamid Sheikh, Director General of the EPA, impose a complete ban on the establishment of new car wash stations within Punjab’s territorial jurisdiction,” the DG declared. The order takes effect immediately and will remain in force until modified or withdrawn, with violations punishable under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n\nOPERATIONS: District administration teams demolished illegal encroachments and unauthorised structures on Saturday.\n\nThe Nishtar assistant commissioner (AC) inspected Kahna Nau Hospital’s parking area and sealed five properties during an anti-encroachment drive in Kahna Market.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cantt AC targeted Dharampura Bazaar, confiscated six handcarts and four counters and at Abdullah Gull Interchange, officials arrested six people, filed prosecutions and seized five carts.\n\nElsewhere, the Ravi AC cleared cattle and nomad huts from Sagian and Shahdara. The Sadar AC removed five counters and 15 signboards along Bedian Road.\n\nThe Allama Iqbal Town AC confiscated a truckload of goods at Ammar Center on Multan Road and cleared two illegal settlements along the motorway.\n\nThe AC of Raiwind seized another truck of goods on Raiwind Road, and the City AC removed unauthorized banners and flexes from The Mall and Civil Secretariat.\n\nSeparately, the Lahore Development Authority accelerated development schemes, including the Gulberg housing project, under a sustainable model, per a spokesman.\n\nRAILWAY: Pakistan Railways issued an order for the mutual transfer of Sabahat Mushtaq, currently divisional commercial officer (Rawalpindi), and Anwar Sadat, senior marketing manager (freight, Lahore), according to a notification.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
