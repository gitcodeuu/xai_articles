But in the past few years, it’s quite dry,” Muhammad, a researcher at the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), told AFP.\n\nThe first “ice stupas” in Gilgit-Baltistan were created in 2018.\n\nNow, more than 20 villages make them every winter, and “more than 16,000 residents have access to water without having to build reservoirs or tanks”, said Rashid-ud-Din, provincial head of GLOF-2, a UN-Pakistan plan to adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\nFarmer Muhammad Raza told AFP that eight stupas were built in his village of Hussainabad this winter, trapping approximately 20 million litres of water in the ice.\n\n“We no longer have water shortages during planting,” he said, since the open-air reservoirs appeared on the slopes of the valley.\n\n“Before, we had to wait for the glaciers to melt in June to get water, but the stupas saved our fields,” said Ali Kazim, also a farmer in the valley.\n\nBefore the stupas, “we planted our crops in May”, said 26-year-old Bashir Ahmed who grows potatoes, wheat and barley in nearby Pari village which has also adopted the method.\n\nAnd “we only had one growing season, whereas now we can plant two or three times” a year.\n\nTemperatures in Pakistan rose twice as fast between 1981 and 2005 compared to the global average, putting the country on the front line of climate change impacts, including water scarcity.\n\nIts 240m inhabitants live in a territory that is 80 per cent arid or semi-arid and depends on rivers and streams originating in neighbouring countries for more than three-quarters of its water.\n\nGlaciers are melting rapidly in Pakistan and across the world, with a few exceptions including the Karakoram mountain range, increasing the risk of flooding and reducing water supply over the long term.\n\n“Faced with climate change, there are neither rich nor poor, neither urban nor rural; the whole world has become vulnerable,” said 24-year-old Yasir Parvi.\n\n“In our village, with the ice stupas, we decided to take a chance.”",
