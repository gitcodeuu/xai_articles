  "content": "SWAT: Office-bearers of an organisation set up to oppose construction of a cantonment in the Kabal tehsil of Swat on Saturday threatened to stage a sit-in if the government didn’t reverse the decision.\n\nThe warning was given by Sultan Ali Khan, chairman of Tanzeem Sama Lar, Koza Bandai, while addressing a news conference at the Swat Press Club. Other office-bearers of the organisation, including Akbar Ali, Hashim Khan, Afzal Khan, Khan Mohammad, Shah Wazir, and Fazalzada were also present on this occasion.\n\nMr Khan said that they were not against the state institutions, but they would not compromise on their rights. “We demand that the government reverse the decision to set up a cantonment board in Kabal,” he said.\n\nHe said that some individuals were trying to take undue credit for the efforts of their organisation for personal gains. “We wish to make it clear that if the government announces the cancellation of the cantonment project today, we will immediately end our protest,” he said\n\n“Even in India, 200 cantonment projects were announced, but public protests led to their cancellation. So why is the government of Pakistan subjecting the people of Swat to such injustice? Our protest is solely for the attainment of our rightful demands and is being led entirely by the indigenous residents of the area,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
