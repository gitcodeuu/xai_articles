The winner receives automatic qualification through to the PSA World Championships as well as the lion’s share of a $60,000 prize pot, according to World Squash.\n\nMariam Malik was the first Pakistani player in action this morning. The 21-year-old was thrashed by Spain’s Noa Romero Blazquez 11-3, 11-2, 11-4 in the opening match.\n\nNext up for Pakistan was Noor Zaman. The second seed stormed to victory against Kuwait’s Hussain Alzaatari with 6-11, 11-5, 4-11, 3-11.\n\nFormer world junior squash champion Hamza Khan cruised to victory in three straight sets over Romania’s Radu Stefan Pena 3-11, 1-11, 5-11.\n\nKhan made history in 2023 when he won the World Junior Squash Championship 2023 on Sunday after beating Egypt’s Mohamed Zakaria, becoming the country’s first champion since 1986.\n\nPakistan’s Muhammad Ammad lost to Malaysia’s Ameeshenraj Chandaran in a close five-set match, with Chandaran winning the final set 11-8.\n\nSana Bahadar went up against Czechia’s Tamara Holzbauerova and was beaten by Holzbauerova 13-11, 11-6, 8-11 and 11-8.\n\nA total of 22 matches across five courts at Creek Club are set to place take today.\n\nPakistan Squash Federation (PSF) Vice President and Sindh Squash President Adnan Asad made no secret of his and his colleagues’ goal to return Pakistan to the summit of the game.\n\n“My vision is to create a few Jahangir Khans in the next five years,” Asad told World Squash earlier this week.\n\nHe adds that hosting the championships forms part of a two pronged strategy that will see Pakistan host more high profile events in the future to give local players more opportunities to compete with the world’s best talents, coupled with an increased PSF and private investment in facilities, equipment and grassroots programmes.\n\n“We have very high hopes,” Asad admits. “By hosting this championship, I expect a large number of Pakistani players to get serious and work hard for the next few years and hopefully get Pakistan back as a world beater.\n\nWhile speaking to the global governing body last month, Zaman told World Squash it was a huge honour to represent Pakistan.\n\n“There’s an incredible sense of pride and responsibility when you step onto the court in front of your own people. The energy and support from the crowd is electric, and it pushes you to perform at your absolute best.\n\n“It’s a chance to show the world the talent we have in Pakistan and to inspire the next generation of squash players,” he said.",
