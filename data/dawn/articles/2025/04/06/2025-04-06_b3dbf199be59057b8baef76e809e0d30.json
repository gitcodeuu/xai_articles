  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Despite spending large sums and conducting several operations over the years, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has failed to prevent the resurgence of illegal settlements in Sector I-12.\n\nThe slum dwellers have gradually begun returning, particularly to I-12/3, where they are setting up makeshift shelters. The Sector I-12 plot owners have blamed the CDA, saying that had the development work been completed according to the deadline set by the CDA chairman, which was October 2024, this situation would never have occurred.\n\nIn 2023, the CDA launched a large-scale anti-encroachment operation, clearing over 700 kanal of land illegally occupied by settlers. Another operation in May 2024 resulted in the reclamation of 125 kanal, with more than 75 structures demolished. A third major operation was carried out in January 2025, leading to the demolition of rooms and livestock enclosures. Despite these extensive efforts, slum dwellers are once again moving in.\n\nMuhammad Masood Ilyas, one of the allottees, said, “The slow pace of development work in Sector I-12 has allowed slum dwellers to return.\n\n“The resurgence of these illegal settlements poses a serious challenge to the already slow development process in the sector,” he said.\n\nTahir Mahmood, another allottee, said, “CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa had directed the CDA authorities to expedite the development work and hand over possession to the allottees by October 2024. However, his directives have not been followed.”\n\nHe said the failure to deliver timely possession of plots not only undermined the trust of thousands of allottees but also worsened the capital’s housing crisis.\n\n“The return of slum dwellers is not just a setback; it is a clear reflection of CDA’s inefficiency and lack of follow-through. If the development (work) had been carried out as promised, these illegal settlements would never have reappeared,” he added.\n\nHe stated, “We, the allottees, have been waiting for possession for over three decades, and now we fear that our dreams of building homes in Sector I-12 may never materialise.”\n\nKhumar Gul, another plot owner, expressed his disappointment, saying, “The CDA has spent public money on these repeated operations, yet nothing seems to change on the ground….”\n\nHe proposed that the CDA should immediately grant conditional possession of the plots to the allottees, allowing them to begin building their houses while continuing its development work.\n\nThe allottees also urged the civic body to expedite the process for the possession of their plots and implement stronger and sustainable measures, including continuous monitoring of cleared areas and visible progress in the sector’s development.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that Sector I-12 spans 745.87 acres and comprises 6,040 residential plots of varying sizes, including 25×50, 30×60, and 35×65 square feet.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
