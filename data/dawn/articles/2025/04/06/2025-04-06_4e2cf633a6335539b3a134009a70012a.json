Exports from the North rose by 7.8pc to 1.12m tonnes, up from 1.039m tonnes.\n\nExports jump 28pc to 6.53m tonnes in July-March\n\nTotal despatches from the North decreased by 5.4pc to 23.91m tonnes, compared to 25.28m tonnes in July-March.\n\nIn the South, domestic despatches declined by 9.6pc to 4.67m tonnes from 5.17m tonnes in the corresponding period of last fiscal year. In contrast, exports surged by 33.3pc to 5.42m tonnes from 4.06m tonnes.\n\nTotal despatches from South-based mills increased by 9.3pc to 10.08m tonnes, up from 9.23m tonnes.\n\nIn March 2025, domestic cement despatches dropped by 11.3pc to 2.96m tonnes, compared to 3.34m tonnes in March 2024.\n\nExport volumes remained largely flat at 608,614 tonnes compared to 605,142 tonnes in the same month last year. Total despatches for the month fell by 9.5pc to 3.57m tonnes from 3.94m tonnes in March 2024.\n\nA spokesman for the APCMA emphasised the importance of cement as a core driver of economic activity, noting its role in providing both direct and indirect employment across multiple sectors.\n\nHe said cement is a vital commodity and supports thousands of skilled and unskilled workers, along with many allied industries.\n\n“We are optimistic that policymakers will consider reducing taxes and duties on cement in the upcoming budget in order to make the commodity affordable to the masses, thereby increasing domestic off-take,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
