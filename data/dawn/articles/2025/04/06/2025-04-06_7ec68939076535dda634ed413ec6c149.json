Britain’s Dina Asher-Smith was third in 22.96sec.\n\n“It’s really exciting to be here,” Thomas said after her win.\n\nThomas said the prize money offered by the circuit had created an unusually intense degree of competition for an early season event.\n\n“Normally, these early season meets we’re just practising and feeling it out,” Thomas said. “Here...the stakes are high, the prize pot is huge and the level of competition is also really high.\n\n“That’s not something that we’re really used to in our sport and I think it’s really good.”\n\nIn the men’s 100m, where Olympic 100m champion Noah Lyles was a notable absentee, two-time Olympic 200m silver medallist Kenny Bednarek took victory in a thrilling duel with Jamaica’s Oblique Seville.\n\nUS sprinter Bednarek took the tape in 10.07sec, with Seville second in 10.08sec. Britain’s Zharnel Hughes was third in 10.13 while Fred Kerley of the US, the 2022 world 100m champion, was seventh in 10.30sec.\n\n“It’s my first time being in Jamaica and you can definitely hear the crowd, they’re electrifying,” said Bednarek.\n\n“My block starts have gotten a lot better this year but that race didn’t really show it. I ended up struggling. But a win is a win and I’m happy to be here.”\n\nIn other action on Friday, newly crowned world indoor 400m champion Chris Bailey continued his impressive start to the season with victory in the 400m in a time of 44.34sec, pipping Olympic silver medallist Matt Hudson-Smith of Great Britain, who was second in 44.65sec, with veteran US one-lap specialist Vernon Norwood third.\n\nThe men’s 400m hurdles saw a win for Brazil’s Alison Dos Santos in a world-leading time of 47.61sec, with Jamaica’s Roshawn Clarke second in 48.20 and Caleb Dean of the US third in 48.58.\n\nIn the women’s 3,000m, Ethiopia’s Ejgayehu Taye produced a devastating late kick to win in 8min 28.42sec ahead of Kenya’s Agnes Jebet Ngetich, with another Ethiopian Tsige Gebreselama third in 8:38.15.\n\nThe women’s 800m saw a world-leading time from Nikki Hiltz, the American record-holder in the mile who is better known as a 1,500m runner.\n\nHiltz won in 1min 58.23sec, with Diribe Welteji second in 1:58.29 and Australia’s Jessica Hull third in 1:58.58.\n\nKenya’s Mary Moraa, the reigning world champion, finished last in 2:00.97.\n\nAmerican runners meanwhile claimed a 1-2-3 finish in the men’s 5,000m, with Grant Fisher winning in 14min 39.14sec.A purse of $12.6 million is on the table at the four-event Grand Slam, which will hold races in Miami, Philadelphia and Los Angeles this year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
