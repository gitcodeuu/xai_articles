He then rushed home where he shot dead his wife Ms Meerzadi, 25, and his sister Ms Zahida, 16, and escaped, he said.\n\nThe injured Hakim was taken to Sehwan hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival and the body was brought to Sakrand taluka hospital for autopsy, he said.\n\nGhulam Rasool Mahar, the victim’s uncle, told reporters that the suspect along with a group of Chandio armed men had killed Hakim as he wanted to occupy his farmland.\n\nHe had killed innocent women of his own family to make the murders appear as motivated by feelings of bruised honour, he said and demanded police authorities immediately arrest the killers and serve justice to the victims’ families.\n\nThe SHO said the suspect was also involved in a number of murder cases lodged with Pubjo police station. They would launch a thorough investigation into the triple murder after release of autopsy report and registration of FIR, he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
