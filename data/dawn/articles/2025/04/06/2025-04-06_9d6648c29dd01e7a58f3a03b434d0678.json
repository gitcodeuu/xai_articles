They condemned the silence of the international community on the ongoing violence.\n\nPM Shehbaz reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian cause, vowing to raise the issue at every international forum. “Pakistan’s stance on supporting our helpless Palestinian brothers and sisters who are victims of Zionist oppression is clear,” he emphasised.\n\nThe conversation reflected a shared resolve to continue advocating for public relief at home and justice for oppressed people abroad.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 6th, 2025",
