We have also established a health, safety and environment directorate to promote a safety culture and prevent accidents involving employees and the general public,” Mr Haidar said while talking to Dawn on Sunday.\n\nAccording to him, the company has set up transformer reclamation workshops in Kasur and Sheikhupura, resulting in annual savings of approximately Rs100m and making transformers replacement speedy, ending inconvenience faced by the consumers.\n\nCar wash stations being inspected for water recycling equipment\n\nHe revealed that the installation of 535,000 AMI/smart meters (with own resources and ADB, respectively) at industrial, tube well, domestic and commercial connections under Lesco’s five years business plan is underway.\n\n“So far 55,000 AMI meters have been installed and tenders for the rest of the meters are under process. Losses have been significantly reduced because of this initiative.”\n\nThe Lesco CEO said the company had achieved significant cost savings of approximately Rs4bn in the procurement of distribution and STG material compared to other distribution companies (DISCOs).\n\nTo a question, he said that during anti-theft campaign, the company recovered an amount of Rs4.23bn out of total Rs8.18bn detection bill charged, almost 52pc of overall in Punjab. In addition to this, Rs35.12bn have been recovered from private defaulters.\n\nSpeaking about system upgrades, Mr Haider said, the company’s field formations installed over 4,000 transformers of various capacities under the System Augmentation Plan to enhance the efficiency of distribution network.\n\nMoreover, seven new 132kV grid stations have also been established besides upgrading 16 power transformers. Besides, reconductoring works at 116km long 132kV transmission lines have also been carried out, ensuring grid stations are well-maintained and environmentally improved.\n\nReconductoring of 132kV rail conductoring with HTLS conductors will be completed up to June-2025. It will substantially reduce over loading of 132 kV lines with improvement in voltage profile /reliability of supply in Lahore.\n\nThe CEO said the company management in various inquiries had imposed major and minor penalties on total 1,400 officers involved in corrupt practices, negligence etc.\n\n“These include dismissal of 97 officers of BPS-17 to 19 from the jobs,” he maintained.\n\nCARS WASH STATIONS: The Lahore administration has started inspecting the car wash stations, including those set up at filling stations, in a bid to ensure installation of water recycling systems to save water. Following directives of the DC, in a recent operation, the assistant commissioner (Saddar), in collaboration with the Environmental\n\nProtection Agency, conducted thorough checks on numerous petrol pumps to ensure compliance with water conservation regulations. This resulted in the sealing of the washing area of a petrol pump and the imposition of a fine amounting to Rs100,000 due to a non-functional recycling system. Furthermore, the AC (Cantt) inspected a petrol pump on Bedian Road and ordered its immediate sealing due to the absence of a mandatory wastewater recycling system.\n\nEmphasizing the critical importance of water conservation, DC Syed Musa Raza said that saving water as the responsibility of every individual and stressed the need to value and prevent its wastage.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 7th, 2025",
