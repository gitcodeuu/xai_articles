He said that for the next protest march they would need more, so they should start their work to prepare at least 5,000 youth from each district to lead the marchers.\n\nDrawing attention of authorities at the helm of affairs, he said that they would adopt all options for a peaceful protest and that time they would definitely ‘feel the heat.’\n\nHe said that all ways were blocked for them including snatching their mandate in the previous general elections, stopping them from staging peaceful protest to raise their voice, violating sanctity of parliament and making the Constitution hostage.\n\n“We will not stop speaking for our imprisoned workers,” he said, adding they were waiting for the call of Imran Khan and they would be on roads after his call.\n\nMeena Khan Afridi said that the morale of party leadership and workers was high and they were ready for the next protest march. He said that they might go to Islamabad by foot if the vehicles were not available.\n\nHe demanded immediate release of all imprisoned workers including Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi and said that their destination would be Islamabad and no one would be able to hide from PTI workers.\n\nHe said that today (Sunday) was the start of the revolution. He said that they would mobilise youth in every district and area and ultimately march towards Islamabad and Rawalpindi.\n\nSohail Afridi said that Pashtuns would never forget the atrocities committed against PTI. He said that they were the followers of Imran Khan and anxiously waiting for his protest call.\n\nWorkers at the convention chanted slogans and said that they were waiting for Imran Khan’s order and whenever the order was given, they would move towards their destination.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 7th, 2025",
