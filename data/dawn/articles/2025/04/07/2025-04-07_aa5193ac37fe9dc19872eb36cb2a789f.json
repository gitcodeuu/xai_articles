Sana will play the consolation quarter-final against Sri Lanka’s Yeheni Kuruppu.\n\nAmna Fayyaz also put up a strong fight when she won the second game but it was ultimately Japan’s Kurumi Takahashi who advanced to the next round with a 11-9, 10-12, 11-4, 11-9 win. Amna will play Spain’s Basquez on Wednesday in the consolation semi-final.\n\nThe Egyptian men’s global dominance was on full display as top seed Ibrahim Elkabbani won 11-2, 9-11, 12-10, 11-2 against Poland’s\n\nLeon Krysiak, while third seed Kareem El Torkey demolished American Hao Cui 11-1, 11-6, 11-5.\n\nAll seeded players on the men’s side proved their worth as they cruised to the next round.\n\nFifth seed David Bernet of Switzerland crushed Japan’s Yuta Ando 11-2, 11-8, 11-7, while seventh seed Dutch Rowan Damming overpowered Malta’s Kijan Sultana 11-6, 11-2, 11-8.
