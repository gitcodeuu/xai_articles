Options being considered include turning the groups into political parties and integrating them into the Iraqi armed forces, he added.\n\nWhile the fate of any disarmament process remains uncertain, the discussions nonetheless mark the first time the militias have been prepared to give ground to longstanding Western pressure to demilitarise.\n\nThe shift comes at a precarious time for Tehran’s regional “Axis of Resistance” which it has established at great cost over decades to oppose Israel and US influence, but has seen severely weakened since Hamas’ attack on Israel on October 7, 2023 tipped the Middle East into conflict.\n\nHamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been hammered by Israel since its military offensive on Gaza began, while the Houthi movement in Yemen has been targeted by US airstrikes since last month.\n\nThe fall of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, another key Iranian ally, has further weakened the Islamic republic’s influence.\n\nIraq is seeking to balance its alliances with both America and Iran in its dealings with the militias on its soil.\n\nThe groups sprang up across the country with Iranian financial and military support in the chaotic wake of the 2003 US invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein and have become formidable forces that can rival the national army in firepower.\n\nUS Secretary of Defence Pete Hegseth told Prime Minister Sudani in a phone call on March 16, shortly after the American strikes on the Houthis began, to prevent the militias from carrying out revenge attacks on Israeli and US bases in the region in support of their allies, according to two government officials and two security sources briefed on the exchange.\n\nThe Iraqi-based militias had launched dozens of drone and rocket attacks against Israel in solidarity with Hamas since the Gaza conflict began and killed three US soldiers in a drone operation in Jordan near the Syrian border last year.\n\nIbrahim al-Sumaidaie, a former political adviser to Sudani, told Iraqi state TV that the United States had long pressed Iraq’s leadership to dismantle Shia militias, but this time Washington might not take no for an answer.\n\n“If we do not voluntarily comply, it may be forced upon us from the outside, and by force.”",
