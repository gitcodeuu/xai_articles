Political leaders, religious scholars, lawyers and local elders attended the meeting.\n\nAn elder said on the occasion that they had gathered with the sole aim to press the government for restoration of peace, resolve people’s problems and express solidarity with terrorism-affected people.\n\nMNA Maulana Syed Naseem Ali Shah, Provincial Minister Pakhtunyar Khan, former minister Malik Shah Mohammad Khan, former senators Mohammad Ibrahim of Jamat-i-Islami and Baz Mohammad Khan of Awami National Party, former tehsil nazims Fida Mohammad Khan and Malik Ihsan Khan, Maulana Tayyab Shah Bukhari, Maulana Abdul Ghaffar Qureshi, Pir Sahib Zaman, Advocate Shaukat Ayaz, Malik Shakil Khan, Malik Shah Karam Khan Wazir, Ghulam Qebaz, and Junaid Rasheed addressed the jirga.\n\nDemands reopening of roads closed for security reasons\n\nThey expressed concerns over poor law and order and said that residents of the district could not bear the brunt of lawlessness, unrest and uncertainty anymore. They said that closure of roads and frequent military operations badly impacted daily life and routine activities of people.\n\nThey asked the government to withdraw elders’ names from Fourth Schedule and release the arrested jirga leaders immediately.\n\n“We, the jirga leaders, do not want to clash with anyone, rather our sole aim is to find a peaceful and dignified solution to the issues pertaining to lawlessness and militancy,” they said.\n\nThe jirga unanimously adopted 12 resolutions and asked the government to accept the demands without any delay.\n\nAnnouncing the joint declaration, Mohammad Ibrahim asked the government to implement the 16-point charter of demand approved by the provincial apex committee in letter and spirit.\n\nHe demanded withdrawal of elders’ names from the Fourth Schedule, releasing detained leaders and reinstatement of sacked policemen to their jobs. “The jirga declares that any kind of military operation is not acceptable at all and the government should resolve issues through negotiations,” he said.\n\nHe asked authorities to initiate action against drug barons in the district. He said that the jirga condemned anti-state elements involved in terrorist attack on Bannu Cantonment last month that also resulted in civilian casualties in Kot Barara and Kot Adil areas. He asked the government to produce missing persons before courts and release those, who had been languishing in illegal detention.\n\n“The jirga also demands restoration of internet service and arranging elders’ meetings with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 7th, 2025",
