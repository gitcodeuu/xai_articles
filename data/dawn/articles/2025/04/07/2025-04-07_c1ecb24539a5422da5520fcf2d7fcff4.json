Don’t be stupid! … Be strong, courageous, and patient, and greatness will be the result!” he urged.\n\nEU trade ministers gathered in Luxembourg on Monday to discuss the bloc’s response, with Germany and France having advocated a tax targeting US tech giants.\n\n“We must not exclude any option on goods, on services,” said French Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc should “open the European toolbox, which is very comprehensive and can also be extremely aggressive,” he said.\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck likewise said Europe should be prepared to use its trade “bazooka” — a new anti-coercion mechanism allowing it to punish any country using economic threats to exert pressure on the EU.\n\nBut signs of divergence emerged from Ireland, whose low corporate tax rate has attracted US tech and pharmaceutical companies.\n\nTargeting services “would be an extraordinary escalation,” said Irish Trade Minister Simon Harris.\n\nTrump on Sunday had doubled down, saying, “Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” He told reporters aboard Air Force One that world leaders were “dying to make a deal”.\n\nTrillions of dollars have been wiped off stocks worldwide since Trump announced the tariffs last week, and the losses deepened on Monday.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon warned the tariffs “will likely increase inflation”, in a letter to shareholders Monday. “Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,” he said.\n\nTaipei recorded its heaviest loss on record as it sank 9.7pc.\n\nThe Stoxx Europe 600 index was down 5pc in early afternoon deals, with more than €1.5tr of market capitalisation going up in smoke over just a few days. The main US oil contract dropped below $60 a barrel for the first time since April 2021 on worries of a global recession.\n\n“The market’s telling you in plain language: global demand is vanishing, and a global recession is on the cards and coming on fast,” said Stephen Innes at SPI Asset Management.\n\nUS officials said more than 50 countries have reached out to Trump to negotiate.\n\nJapan’s Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Monday he had held a call with Trump in which they agreed to more talks on the tariffs.\n\nBenjamin Netanyahu, prime minister of Israel — hit with 17pc tariffs, despite being one of Washington’s closest allies — was due on Monday to become the first leader to meet Trump since last week’s announcement.\n\nVietnam, a manufacturing powerhouse with a big trade surplus with the United States, has already reached out and requested a delay of at least 45 days to thumping 46pc tariffs.",
