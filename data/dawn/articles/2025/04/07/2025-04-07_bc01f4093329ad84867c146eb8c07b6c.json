By reasons thereof, you appear to be guilty of ‘Inefficiency & Misconduct’ within the meaning of Rule 2(1) (h) & (k) and 3 (a) & (b) of the Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules 2020,” says one of the charge sheets.\n\nThe concerned federal officials have also been threatened with “major penalty of dismissal from service” and told to appear before an inquiry officer for an in-person hearing, that too in Islamabad.\n\nThere has been a sense of resentment against the federal government and the PPP-led government in Sindh for their attempt to silence those raising voice for their rights.\n\nThe JPMC employees, who got the employment after passing the Federal Public Service Commission exams, feel that the federal and provincial governments should have first considered them for executive director and other important posts rather than appointing some Sindh government official.\n\n“What is the point of merit and seniority when the government appoints its favourites on key posts? And when we move courts, they accuse us of misconduct, initiate inquiries and threaten us, especially women, of dismissal from services,” one of the doctors said.\n\nThe concerned employees have now appealed to the prime minister and PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to take notice of the vindictive actions against them.\n\nThey also appealed to rights organisations, especially those raising their voice for women rights, to play their role to stop government harassment against women doctors of the JPMC.\n\n‘Civil servants can’t be penalised for litigating’\n\nTalking to Dawn, senior lawyer Hassan Mandviwalla said: “Civil servants cannot be penalised for litigating. Seeking legal recourse is a fundamental right, and any retaliation for doing so would be a violation of constitutional protections.”\n\nHe said that the fundamental rights of all citizens are protected under Part II, Chapter 1, of the Constitution.\n\nHe explained that “Article 25 (1) provides that all citizens are equal before law and are entitled to equal protection of law, which means that there can be no distinction under law between those who litigate or those who are perceived to habitually litigate against their department as they ought to be provided equal protection to safeguard their fundamental rights.\n\n“Section 22 of the Civil Servants Act 1974 provides recourse for a civil servant to challenge an order affecting the terms and conditions of their employment, with an appeal lying to the Federal Services Tribunal established under Article 212 of the Constitution, and a final appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\n“For matters beyond the terms and conditions of employment and where no alternate remedy is available, a civil servant may approach the high court in its constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 seeking extraordinary relief, against a departmental charge sheet or order,” he said, adding: “This framework ensures that civil servants have access to legal remedies and safeguards against any punitive action taken in response to their pursuit of justice.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 7th, 2025",
