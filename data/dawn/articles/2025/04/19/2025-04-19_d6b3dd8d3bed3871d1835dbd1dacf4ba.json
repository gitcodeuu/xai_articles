  "content": "Tremors were felt in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab — including Peshawar, Islamabad, Rawalpindi and Lahore — for the second time in as many weeks as a 5.9-magnitude earthquake struck near the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region on Saturday, authorities said.\n\nThe earthquake occurred at around 11:48am and measured 5.9 on the Richter scale, according to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD).\n\nIt struck at a depth of 94 kilometres with its epicentre in the border region of Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\n\nHowever, the German Research Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) said the earthquake had a 5.8-magnitude and was at a depth of 92km, while the United States Geological Survey put the magnitude at 5.7 and depth at 94km.\n\nSeveral districts in KP were jolted as a result but no loss of life or damage was reported, Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi said.\n\nTremors were felt in Battagram, Mansehra, Abbottabad, Shangla, Nowshera, Peshawar and Swabi districts, causing people to come out of buildings, according to a Dawn.com correspondent.\n\nMeanwhile, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), quoting initial reports in a statement, said jolts were felt in various cities there, including Lahore, Gujrat and Faisalabad.\n\n“The administrations across the entire Punjab are inspecting buildings,” the PDMA director general was quoted as saying. He added that the teams and machinery had been kept on alert to “deal with the aftershocks of the earthquake”.\n\nAny damages caused by the earthquake can be reported to the PDMA by calling its 1129 helpline, the statement said.\n\nA week ago, no casualties were reported after a 5.5-magnitude earthquake struck near Islamabad and Rawalpindi. That tremor came an hour after separate quakes, measuring 4.3 and 3.8 on the Richter scale, hit the Afghanistan-Tajikistan border region.\n\nPakistan witnessed around 20 low-intensity earthquakes in the first half of February — an average of more than one tremor each day.\n\nHowever, experts had pointed out that such minor seismic activities “preempt” high-intensity earthquakes by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates.\n\nPakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — according to geological engineer Muhammad Rehan, creating five seismic zones within the country.\n\nAdditional input from Humayun Baber, Reuters",
