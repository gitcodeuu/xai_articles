He said the journey initiated today mirrors the challenging circumsta­nces faced by the PML-N government in 2013.\n\nHe recalled that when PML-N assumed office in 2013, Pakistan was engulfed in despair, terrorism was rampant, load-shedding lasted up to 18 hours a day, and the industrial sector was paralysed. Balochistan, in particular, was plagued by lawlessness, with businesses and roads unsafe and overall governance in disarray, he said.\n\nReflecting on the achievements from 2013 to 2018, Mr Iqbal said that by 2017-18, peace had been restored in Balochistan, an extensive network of roads had been built, and development projects gained momentum.\n\nHe highlighted that the Gwadar-Quetta journey, which once took 36 hours, had been reduced to just eight hours through the construction of a 650-kilometre highway.\n\nThis infrastructure not only improved connectivity but also spurred employment and economic activities along its route, he said.\n\nThe federal minister elaborated that the PML-N’s political vision is fir­mly linked to the development of Balochistan, unlike others who thrive on its backwardness.\n\nMajor projects such as the construction of the Gwadar-Khuzdar-Ratodero road, the dualisation of the Quetta-Zhob highway, and upgrades to the N-25 highway were cited as milestones achieved under the PML-N government.\n\nEducation was another key area highlighted by the federal minister and pointed out that new universities and campuses were established in Balochistan’s remote areas. Institutions like the Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences and Sardar Bahadur Khan Women’s University were also receiving additional funding.\n\nMr Iqbal said the PML-N’s development strategy focused on education, infrastructure, energy, and human resource development.\n\nHe said Uraan Pakistan initiative was now ready to soar once again. If pursued with unwavering focus over the next 22 years, Pakistan could become one of Asia’s leading economies by 2047. He said that Gwadar Port will serve as a key gateway for exports, and highlighted the anticipated investment boom following the development of the Reko Diq project.\n\nCollaboration between the federal and provincial governments, particularly in the sectors of water security, livestock, solar energy, and IT, is central to the Uraan Pakistan strategy.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said that Uraan Pakistan programme is a well-structured and visionary initiative, built on clear development planning.\n\nHe said that it is not a utopian dream, but is backed by strategy and practical steps, much like how many nations in the world realised their dreams through vision and determination.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
