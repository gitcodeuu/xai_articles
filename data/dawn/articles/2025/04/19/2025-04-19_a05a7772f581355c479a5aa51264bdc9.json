  "content": "TORONTO: With less than two weeks to go before Canadians head to the polls, the four major federal party leaders faced off in a tense and combative English-language debate in Montreal on Thursday night.\n\nLiberal leader and Prime Minister Mark Carney, Conser­vative leader Pierre Poilievre, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Bloc Québécois leader Yves-François Blanchet clashed over the cost of living, national security, and the unprecedented challenge posed by US President Donald Trump.\n\nCarney, the frontrunner according to most polls, was the primary target from the outset. Poilievre, Blanchet and Singh all took swipes at the Liberal leader within the first 10 minutes, accusing him of being out of touch with everyday Canadians and too closely tied to the legacy of former prime minister Justin Trudeau.\n\n“Mark Carney is asking for a fourth Liberal term,” said Poilievre. “Are you prepared to elect the same Liberal MPs, the same Liberal ministers, the same Liberal staffers all over again for a fourth term?”\n\nMark Carney countered that he was not a Trudeau clone. “It may be difficult for Mr Poilievre,” he said. “You spent years running against Justin Trudeau and the carbon tax — they’re both gone. I am a very different person than Justin Trudeau. I am focused on results.” As accusations mounted that he was using Trudeau-era advisers, Carney offered a smile and retorted: “I do my own talking points, thank you very much.”\n\nTrump takes centre stage\n\nDonald Trump’s increasingly hostile stance toward Canada emerged as a central concern. “The biggest risk we have to face is Donald Trump,” Carney warned. “We’ve got to get that right.”\n\nHe added: “We can give ourselves far more than Donald Trump can take away.”\n\nCarney positioned himself as a steady hand amid global instability, referencing his track record as a central banker and crisis manager. “When I was governor of the Bank of Canada, inflation was below two per cent and the dollar was at parity,” he said. “That is the kind of success I can deliver for this country.”\n\nSingh and Poilievre repeatedly challenged that claim, pointing to skyrocketing inflation and housing unaffordability under Liberal leadership. Singh also criticised Poilievre’s past role as housing minister in Stephen Harper’s cabinet, claiming he oversaw the construction of just six government-built homes during his tenure. “It was six homes and that’s the fact,” Singh said, holding up six fingers.\n\n“You can count to six, which is great.”\n\nPoilievre pushed back, saying the number was far higher and that roughly 200,000 homes were built during his time in office — a figure Carney dismissed as “a misunderstanding of the housing market.\n\nClashing visions\n\nOn immigration, the leaders’ positions were sharply divided. Poilievre accused the Liberals of creating “massive overcrowding in our communities” and pledged to return immigration to “normal levels.”\n\nHe also claimed that Carney supports a “radical policy” to push Canada’s population to 100 million by the end of the century. Carney didn’t respond to the accusation during the debate, but previously stated in the French-language debate that he supports a cap to reduce the number of newcomers.\n\nPublic safety and the use of constitutional powers sparked one of the most heated exchanges of the night. Poilievre promised to invoke the notwithstanding clause to ensure mass murderers serve consecutive life sentences. “He [Carney] says it’s dangerous for me to ensure that mass murderers stay behind bars for life,” Poilievre said. “You know what’s dangerous? Turning them loose on our streets. People are living in terror.”\n\nCarney warned that such a move could erode Canadians’ charter protections. “It’s very dangerous,” he said. “It’s not where you start, but where will you stop?”\n\nJagmeet Singh, the NDP leader, also weighed in, calling Poilievre’s framing ludicrous“. Singh said all leaders agree that mass murderers should receive harsh sentences, but warned against politicising justice.\n\nHe also accused both Carney and Poilievre of ignoring environmental realities: “The Liberals bought a pipeline and they’re pretty pro-pipeline. I don’t know what Pierre’s complaining about, but that’s what they did.”\n\nCarney, meanwhile, criticised Poilievre’s energy policy: “You can’t be tough on crime unless you’re tough on guns.”\n\nHe said Poilievre’s plan to dismantle existing gun control laws would endanger public safety.\n\nThe Bloc’s Blanchet struck a nationalist tone, arguing that Quebec’s interests were being ignored. “Mr Trump will be 90 years old and not the president,” he said, questioning the rationale behind long-term pipeline construction as a way to counter Trump’s economic aggression.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
