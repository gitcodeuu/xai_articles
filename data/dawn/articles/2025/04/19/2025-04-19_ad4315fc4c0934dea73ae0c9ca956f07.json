However, the YDA president rejected the offer of the police and marched towards the CM Secretariat as per the given call.\n\nA clash took place between the two sides when the employees moved forward, according to the eyewitnesses. They said the police reportedly thrashed some of the young medics, including the YDA Punjab president, and then used the water cannon to disperse them.\n\nA video clip of the incident showed Dr Shoaib Niazi fainted on the Mall Road while the police high-ups declared it a ‘drama,’ saying the police used water cannons with low water pressure just to push the protesters back. The employees alleged that two of the protesters fainted as the police used adulterated water while the police strongly denied the allegations, saying the demonstrators were trying to get sympathies to divert the attention.\n\nTalking to the media, the YDA president announced to intensify the protest by observing strikes at the OPDs of the hospitals. The police alleged that the YDA was using the women employees as ‘shield’ to violate the earlier agreement according to which the Charing Cross was decided to be their protest venue.\n\nThere are reports that a group of the women employees managed to reach the Club Chowk by dodging the police and staged a sit-in there while the other employees had staged a sit-in outside the Alhamra building.\n\nIn the related development, the paramedics of the Lahore General Hospital (LGH) completely shut down the OPD and some other wards of the hospital for suspending two employees of the teaching hospital for supporting the protest against outsourcing the hospitals. Reportedly, they locked the rooms of the doctors at the OPD and pushed the patients outside the facility.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
