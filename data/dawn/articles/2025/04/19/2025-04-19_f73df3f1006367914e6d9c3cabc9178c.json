  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Governor Jaffar Khan Mandokhail, during his visit to St. Petersburg Mining University in Russia, emphasised the potential for Pakistan to transform from an agricultural country into a modern industrial nation.\n\nHe said that just as Russia has transitioned from a developing nation into a global superpower, this university has also earned a reputation in the field of research and engineering.\n\nHe noted that by leveraging the knowledge and experience of both Russia and its premier educational institutions, Pakistan — particularly Balochistan — can benefit significantly in its journey toward ind­ustrial and technological advancement.\n\nDuring his visit, Governor Mandokhail expressed gratitude for the warm reception and praised the comprehensive briefing provided on the university’s historical background and outstanding performance.\n\nHe highlighted Balochistan’s significant geographical position and its wealth of minerals and natural resources. He stressed the urgent need to foster stronger bilateral ties and institutional partnerships to pro­mote knowledge sharing, rese­arch collaboration, and capacity building between the two nations.\n\nHe also expressed his strong commitment to creating new educational opportunities for students enrolled in public sector universities across Balochistan. His goal, he said, is to ensure that the youth of the province gain access to advanced knowledge, skills, and top-tier academic resources available through such global collaborations.\n\nEarlier in the day, the governor toured various sections of St. Petersburg Mining University, including classrooms, simulators, and the university’s museum.\n\nGovernor Mandokhail showed a keen interest in the exhibits and expressed a desire for guidance and cooperation to enhance the academic standards of public sector universities in Balochistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
