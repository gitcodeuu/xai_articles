  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Friday expressed its displeasure over traffic congestion caused by protests on The Mall, saying that the right to protest does not mean the entire city should come to a standstill.\n\n“The closure of a single road is impacting traffic across all of Lahore,” Justice Shahid Karim observed during a weekly hearing of the petitions regarding smog and other environmental issues.\n\nThe judge said the city appeared to be shut down in the name of “high-level security,” and emphasised the need for a permanent solution to the issue.\n\nNoting that the protests had been ongoing for several days, the judge urged the authorities concerned to engage in a dialogue with the demonstrators.\n\nA Punjab government counsel informed the court that negotiations were being held with the protesters. The judge suggested moving the protesters to an alternative location and reiterated that the protests should not result in road blockages.\n\nLahore Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Dr Athar Waheed stated that the city’s traffic system cannot function properly until The Mall is reopened.\n\nHe said the creation of high-security zones during events like the Pakistan Super League (PSL) leaves a negative impression.\n\nThe judge called for a long-term solution to the problem.\n\nThe CTO submitted a report regarding the action taken against beggars and suggested that specific legislation was required to address the issue.\n\nThe CTO further stated that a proposal to ban motorcycle-rickshaws had been sent to the Punjab home department. He said these three-wheelers were responsible for fatalities.\n\nJustice Karim hinted at revoking the licences of motorcycle-rickshaw manufacturers if they do not ensure compliance with transport laws within three months. He remarked that banning illegal motorcycle-rickshaws was essential, directing that the summary should reach the chief minister’s office by next week.\n\nDuring the hearing, Justice Karim highlighted that due to changes in climate conditions, the month of April witnessed three extreme weather events —intense heat, heavy rainfall, and hailstorms.\n\nThe judge adjourned the hearing till April 25.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
