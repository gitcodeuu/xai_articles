These include 25,000 individuals destined for the United States, 9,000 for Australia, 6,000 for Canada, 3,000 for Ger­many, and more than 1,000 for the United Kingdom.\n\nFresh figures on the relocation process were not provided by the Foreign Office or other relevant ministries.\n\nDespite early momentum, the relocation process slowed significantly, leaving thousands in limbo. In November 2023, Pakistan initiated a drive to expel undocumented foreigners, affecting Afghans. To date, more than 907,000 individuals have been repatriated.\n\nWarning to facilitators\n\nMr Chaudhry also warned that strict action would be taken against those Pakistanis who were found to be facilitating the illegal stay of Afghans by any means. This includes providing jobs, rented accommodation, or any other form of assistance.\n\n“We have communicated clear instructions to all provinces,” he said. “If anyone gives a shop, house, or any kind of space to an illegal foreigner, they will be held accountable under the law.”\n\nThe minister said that only foreign nationals with valid legal documents were eligible to rent property, open businesses, or seek employment in Pakistan. “Pakistani citizens are only permitted to work with or rent to those who have proper legal status in the country,” he added.\n\nHe said Pakistan was pursuing a balanced approach that includes diplomatic coordination with the Afghan government. He also referred to reports suggesting that some of the one million weapons left behind by US forces in Afghanistan had reached the hands of terrorist groups, posing a serious threat to Pakistan and the region.\n\nRepatriation process\n\nHe stressed that the repatriation process was being conducted in a lawful, organised, and humane manner. Pakistani authorities were working closely with Afghan counterparts to facilitate the transition, providing facilities such as boarding, health, and security to Afghan nationals at transit points.\n\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also coordinating with the Afghan government for the safe and secure repatriation of their nationals.\n\nMr Chaudhry said that over one million visas were issued to Afghan nationals in two years in 16 different categories by Pakistan.\n\nAfghan delegation\n\nMeanwhile, a delegation of the interim government of Afghanistan also met with the minister of state for interior.\n\nThe delegation was led by the Acting Minister for Commerce and Industry of Afghanistan, Haji Nooruddin Azizi. It also included the Afghan minister for refugees and repatriation, the Afghan ambassador to Pakistan, and other senior officials.\n\nAt the meeting, both sides held detailed discussions on several important matters, including transit trade and the repatriation of Afghan nationals.\n\nThe interior minister during the meeting explai­ned that the purpose of the ‘One-Document Regime’ was to ensure that no individual resides in Pakistan without legal documentation.\n\nHe emphasised that every effort would be made to facilitate repatriation of Afghans. He said more than 50 transit camps equipped with medical and other essential facilities have been set up across the country.\n\nThe minister said complaint cells had also been established under the supervision of the interior ministry and provincial chief secretaries to prevent any untoward incident. He announced that Afghan nationals holding PoR (Proof of Registration) cards would not face any difficulty until June 30.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
