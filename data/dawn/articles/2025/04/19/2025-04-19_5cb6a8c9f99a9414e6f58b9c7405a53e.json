Cloudburst was reported to be the main reason for the flooding, according to him.\n\nThe DC said that the widespread torrential rains have lashed the length and breadth of the valley causing blockage of vehicular traffic in the roads passing through hilly roads of Garam Chashma, Sheshi Koh, Kalash valleys, Golen and Arsoon.\n\nAn official of Rescue 1122 said that hundreds of vehicles were stranded on Chitral-Peshawar Road segment at the affected village of Broze out of which many ambulances were shifting passengers to Peshawar from Chitral.\n\nHe said workers of Rescue 1122 helped shift patients and the injured to the other side with the help of stretchers.\n\nHailstorm, thunderstorm and rain lashed Swabi district, damaging standing crops of wheat and tobacco.\n\nFarmers from Maneri Bala and Saleem Khan areas said the hailstorm had badly damaged wheat and tobacco crops, and vegetables.\n\nWisal Mohammad of Maneri Bala region reported damage to the wheat crop that isready for harvesting within a week and said it would cause serious loss to growers.\n\nMeanwhile, in an advisory issued to the district administration, the PDMA said that the Flood Forecasting Division has forecast a strong westerly wave approaching the upper parts of the country.\n\nIt said the weather system was likely to significantly affect the upper parts of the province, bringing widespread rainfall and associated weather activity, which could cause flash floods in the tributaries of the River Kabul.\n\nThe PDMA directed the district administration to closely monitor those areas due to potential for rapid runoff and localised flooding.\n\nIt also recommended measures by authorities to prevent damage to public life and property, infrastructure, crops and cattle.\n\n“Authorities may be requested to take the following safety measures including identification of vulnerable points and at-risk communities and devise mitigation and safety measures, maintaining enhanced alert level and monitoring of developing situations to reduce reaction and response times, and Rescue 1122 and civil defence to remain alert and ensure availability of personnel and equipment during the period,” read the advisory.\n\nIt added that residents, including farmers and cattle herders, should be forewarned to shift cattle away from low lying areas adjacent to the River Kabul and its associated nullahs, while provision of relief and medical supplies to calamity-hit people in timely manner and coordinating with the relevant departments should be ensured to clear roads.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
