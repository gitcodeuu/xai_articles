  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s squash legacy, once defined by legends Jahangir Khan and Jansher Kh­an, is experiencing a thrilling resurgence as a new generation of players dominates global competitions.\n\nOn Friday, 20-year-old Ashab Irfan secured his first major international title at the St. Louis Open while a day earlier, Pakistani juniors claimed four gold medals at the Australian Junior Open, signaling a potential return to the sport’s pinnacle.\n\nAshab, ranked 66th globally, delivered a masterclass to defeat England’s Charlie Lee 11-7, 11-2, 11-7 in the RC Pro Series final held in Missouri. The 37-minute victory marked Ashab’s first major title on the PSA Tour.\n\nAshab’s coach Jahanzeb Masood expects his ranking to jump from 66th to 57th following the win.\n\nAt the Australian Junior Open on Thursday, siblings Mehwish and Mahnoor Ali led the charge. Mehwish, the top seed, defended her girls Under-17 crown with a commanding 11-5, 11-5, 11-7 victory over Eden-Alma Poulava, never dropping a set throughout the tournament.\n\nHer younger sister, 12-year-old Mahnoor, mirrored this dominance, capturing the Under-13 title by defeating Japan’s Riyo Kawabata 11-2, 11-5, 11-6.\n\nTheir sister Sehrish narrowly missed a family trifecta in the Under-15 final, falling 15-13, 5-11, 12-10, 6-11, 11-4 to Japan’s Emily Senior.\n\nPakistan’s junior boys shone equally bright. Azan Ali Khan, ranked No. 2 nationally in Under-17, overpowered Australia’s Henry Kross 11-6, 11-4, 11-9 to claim gold.\n\nMeanwhile, 11-year-old Ahmad Ali Naz rallied after dropping a set to defeat local favorite Freddie Goldsmith 11-5, 2-11, 11-6, 11-6 in the Under-11 final.\n\nThese triumphs follow Noor Zaman’s historic win earlier this month at the Under-23 World Squash Championship in Karachi.\n\nOnce the undisputed kings of squash, Pakistan had struggled to replicate its golden-era success after Jahangir and Jansher retired. However, this week’s achievements — spanning age groups and continents — highlight a rebuilt pipeline of talent.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
