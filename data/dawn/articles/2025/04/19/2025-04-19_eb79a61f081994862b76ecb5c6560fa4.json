  "content": "LAHORE: The Punjab government says it has not banned the meetings of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf supremo Imran Khan in Adiala jail.\n\n“The Punjab government has not imposed any restrictions on meetings with the PTI founder leader,” Punjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari said on Friday.\n\nShe said the PTI leaders were trying to shift the blame for their internal conflicts on the government.\n\n“The PTI itself changes the names of those who are to meet their leader and then hold the Punjab government responsible,” she claimed.\n\nOn Thursday police had stopped the family of Imran Khan from meeting him in prison, despite an order by the high court in this regard. The police briefly detained the sisters of Mr Khan at a checkpoint close to the heavily guarded prison after the PTI leaders engaged in a heated argument with police officials for not allowing them to meet the incarcerated party founder.\n\nMs Bokhari added that according to the jail rules ordinary prisoners were allowed one meeting per week.\n\n“However, the PTI founder has been granted the concession of two meetings on Tuesday and Thursday. The list of visitors is also provided by PTI itself to jail authorities. We have no issue with Aleema Khan or anyone else. It’s the PTI members who have problems with each other. They should not bring their internal party disputes to the public streets.”\n\nThe minister said PTI leaders organised “weekly photo sessions” outside Adiala Jail to gain public sympathy. “Their members voluntarily get into police vans and then disembark at the next intersection,” she said and added the Punjab government was operating in accordance with the constitution and the law.\n\n“PTI should engage in serious politics instead of misleading the public with theatrics,” she advised.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
