  "content": "KARACHI: The city is likely to experience a heatwave starting from Sunday (tomorrow) with daytime temperature expected to soar to 40 degrees Celsius, around 4-6°C above normal, the Met department said on Friday.\n\n“The high pressure area moving away from the upper and central parts of Sindh is likely to block the sea breeze from Sunday,” senior meteorologist Anjum Nazeer Zaigham explained.\n\nHe added that the weather system’s movement towards the southern parts of the province would help subside the ongoing heatwave in rest of the province from Saturday (today).\n\n“Due to the heatwave in Karachi, the general public, especially children, women and senior citizens, are advised to take precautionary measures. Avoid direct exposure to sunlight and remain hydrated,” says the Met department’s advisory.\n\nOn Friday, the maximum temperature recorded in the city was 34.3°C. Hot and humid weather is expected on Saturday with maximum temperature ranging between 36-38°C.\n\nOn Friday, Dadu and Shaheed Benazirabad were the hottest cities in the province with 46.5°C followed by Padidan (46°C), Larkana (45.6°C), Mohenjo Daro and Khairpur (45.5°C), Sukkur and Rohri (45°C), Hyderabad and Mirpurkhas (42°C) and Badin (39°C).\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 19th, 2025",
