The cell will be provided with union council-wise details of parents refusing to vaccinate their children so they can be addressed through social, political and administrative means.\n\nThe CM expressed regret over the continued reporting of polio cases, despite intensive efforts. He directed the health department and district administration to work seriously towards eradicating polio.\n\nHe warned that negligence in the polio campaign would not be tolerated.\n\n“Any official not showing performance will no longer be part of his team. I have already removed some officers from the health department and administration,” he said and added that further negligence in polio eradication would lead to the removal of responsible officers.\n\n“The purpose of today’s meeting is to launch the polio campaign at the Union Council level with renewed enthusiasm,” he said.\n\n“In the past week, two more polio cases were reported, raising the province’s total to nine, which is quite painful,” the chief minister said.\n\nAmong the 29 polio cases reported nationwide, Sindh has nine, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has 18, while Punjab and Azad Jammu & Kashmir have one each police case.\n\n“I do not want a routine presentation regarding polio eradication,” the chief minister said and demanded a comprehensive plan from the health department.\n\nThe new cases reported are two each from Thatta and Badin, while Mithi, Umerkot, Hyderabad, Qambar, and Larkana have one each. Most cases occurred because parents refused to give the polio drops to their kids, or children were not at home during vaccination campaign.\n\nThe Karachi and Malir cases are due to refusal, the chief minister was told.\n\nRefusing polio vaccination is absolutely unacceptable, he emphasised. He questioned how parents could refuse polio drops and cause their children to become disabled.\n\n“Such refusal harms not only their children, but also spreads the virus to other children,” he added.\n\nSamples tested positive\n\nEnvironmental samples for polio in Karachi have tested positive, the meeting was informed.\n\nCurrently, the polio virus is present in areas including Sohrab Goth, Machar Colony, Chakro Nalo, and Rashid Minhas in East Karachi. In West Karachi, virus presence is confirmed in Khamiso Goth, Orangi, and Muhammad Khan Colony in Keamari. In Malir, Bakhtawar Goth; in Korangi, Korangi Nala; in Central Karachi, Haji Merid Goth; and in South, Hijrat Colony and Manzoor Colony show the presence of polio virus.\n\nDrive from 13th\n\nThe CM said that from October 13 the polio campaign must be conducted on a war footing and the entire administration must actively participate in the drive.\n\nHe appealed to the public to come forward so that their children and their neighbours’ children remain polio-free.\n\nAfter receiving the briefing, the chief minister said that most of the new cases in rural areas had been reported from border areas of the districts. This time, he emphasised that the polio vaccination must also cover all nomadic families.\n\nHyderabad and Mirpurkhas Divisions house nomadic families migrating from one area to another, he added.\n\nMinister Health Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, IG Police Ghulam Nabi Memon, Commissioner of Karachi Hassan Naqvi, Secretary to CM Raheem Shaikh, Secretary School Education Zahid Abbasi, Secretary Local Govt Waseem Shamshad, Senior Member Board of Revenue Khalid Hyder Shah, Secretary Health Rehan Baloch, Additional IG Karachi Javed Odho, Coordinator EOC Irashad Sodhar, Director PPHI Javed Jagirani, DG Health Dr Waqar Mahmood, all deputy commissioners of Karachi and (on video link) all divisional commissioners, DIGs and their deputy commissioners as well as DHOs were present.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 4th, 2025",
