However, he emphasised that the process should be carried out with dignity.\n\nMr Gandapur said that KP was rich in resources, but unfortunately, past governments failed to ensure their effective utilisation. “From day one, we adopted a model of economic self-reliance and invested significantly in sectors with strong potential,” he remarked.\n\nWhile highlighting KP’s immense hydropower potential, he said the government was working to harness this energy for industrial development, adding a dedicated provincial transmission line was being laid to supply affordable electricity to industries, thereby creating new job opportunities.\n\nHe said that the government was also focusing on utilising the province’s oil and gas reserves for industrial growth.\n\nThe chief minister informed the visiting delegation that tourism had vast potential to increase provincial revenues. “Work is underway to develop integrated tourism zones of international standards,” he said.\n\nRegarding the merged districts, the chief minister noted that promises made at the time of the merger with KP were not fulfilled and stressed the need for a new National Finance Commission Award to ensure the province received its due share for these districts.\n\nHe claimed 100 per cent population of the province was being provided with Sehat Card health insurance for free medical treatment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 4th, 2025",
