He reiterated Pakistan’s long-standing position advocating for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state based on the pre-1967 borders, with Jerusalem (Al-Quds) as its capital,” added the statement.\n\nLater, the JI leader also took to X (formerly Twitter), saying that during their conversation, he had also conveyed his party’s reservations to the PM on the proposed peace plan in Gaza.\n\n“I also expressed, on behalf of Jamaat-i-Islami as well as the entire nation, serious reservations regarding Trump’s 20-point Gaza plan, and stressed that Pakistan must remain firm on the demand for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. Pakis­tan should not support any plan that ultimately strengthens Israel,” Hafiz Naeem tweeted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 4th, 2025",
