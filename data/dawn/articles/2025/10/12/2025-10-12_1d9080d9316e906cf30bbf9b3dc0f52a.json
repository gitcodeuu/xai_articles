The move came in response to China’s recent curbs on exports of rare earth minerals.\n\nAlthough few US-flagged or built ships are engaged in international trade, China’s new port fee regime casts a wider net by targeting vessels where US-domiciled funds hold 25pc or more in shares or board seats. Analysts say this will significantly broaden the scope of affected companies, particularly those listed on US exchanges.\n\n“This could affect many public shipping companies and cause substantial disruption,” said Erik Broekhuizen, a marine analyst at shipbroking firm Poten & Partners.\n\nSeveral shipping firms are already preparing for dual exposure to port levies from both countries. US-based Matson has told customers it will be subject to China’s fees but will maintain its current schedule. Oil tanker companies, although largely based outside the US, may also be impacted if they are listed on US exchanges. Scorpio Tankers, one of the sector’s largest operators, is among those potentially affected.\n\nData from shipbroker Fearnleys shows nearly 10pc of the global very large crude carrier fleet, and 13pc of the Suezmax, Aframax and LR2 fleet, could be caught in the net.\n\nEnergy data firm Vortexa estimated that 43 LPG super tankers — or 10pc of the global fleet — may also be affected.\n\nChina’s own carriers, including state-owned COSCO and its subsidiary OOCL, will face reciprocal fees from the US. COSCO could incur costs of nearly $2bn in 2026, analysts said. COSCO did not issue a public response.\n\nChina’s transport ministry criticised the US port fees as “discriminatory”, accusing Washington of undermining global trade and shipping stability.\n\nFee structure, timeline\n\nThe new port levy in China will start at 400 yuan ($56) per net metric ton from Tuesday. The rate will rise to 640 yuan ($90) from April 2026, 880 yuan ($124) from April 2027, and reach 1,120 yuan ($157) by April 2028.\n\nThe US, for its part, has imposed a flat rate of $50 per net tonnage on vessels owned or operated by Chinese entities.\n\nThe escalation follows a fragile truce agreed in August, which paused new tariffs for 90 days. That truce is set to expire in early November. In the current round of hostilities, Chinese imports of US agricultural and energy goods have dropped sharply.\n\n“I felt nothing when I saw the news,” said Liu Ming, a 48-year-old software employee. “Trump always announces such capricious policies. China is not afraid.” While policymakers clash, residents in Beijing expressed little alarm over Trump’s latest tariff threat.\n\nSeveral residents interviewed by AFP described Trump as unpredictable, with one joking that his stance could shift after a nap. Others warned the tariffs could hurt American consumers more than the Chinese economy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",
