Also, public awareness efforts have also been launched, with social mobilisation teams engaging residents on preventive measures and early symptom recognition.\n\nThe secretary said the health department had instructed its facilities in the area to ensure the availability of diagnostic kits and essential medicines.\n\n“Daily situation reports are being submitted to the department to track the outbreak’s progression and guide further interventions. Residents have been urged to avoid unnecessary movement and adopt mosquito prevention strategies, including the use of repellents and maintaining clean surroundings,” he said.\n\nThe secretary also said efforts were being made to contain the disease within the union council, while contact tracing and close monitoring of suspected cases were under way.\n\nHe said authorities had assured that all necessary resources were being utilised to control and prevent Chikungunya.\n\nThe doctors said Chikungunya was a community-based infection and not a fatal one like dengue and was usually self-limited as it resolved without treatment in 7-10 days.\n\nThey said the patients reported temperature along with joint pain.\n\nMeanwhile, Charsadda has become the first district in the province after Peshawar to record more than 1,000 dengue cases in the year. The dengue cases from across the province in the year reached 3,202 in the day.\n\nOf them, Charsadda, which borders Peshawar, recorded 1,006 cases, which is 31.42 per cent of the total count. The health department reported 301 cases in Haripur, 299 in Mansehra, 294 in Peshawar, 238 in Mardan, 132 in Swabi, 125 in Kohat and 112 in Abbottabad.\n\nIt said the province had 238 “active” dengue cases, including 99 who tested positive for the infection on Saturday.\n\nOf the new cases,12 dengue patients were hospitalised in the province, taking the number of such cases to 56.\n\nThe department said the mosquito-borne disease had so far sent 1,355 people to hospitals.\n\nHealth officials said there was no specific treatment for the disease and the cases mainly relied on the management of symptoms.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",
