Norway got their third from an Idan Nachmias own goal.\n\nManchester City forward Haaland added his second with a powerful header before nodding in to complete his sixth hat-trick for his country with 18 minutes left.\n\nItaly, attempting to reach their first World Cup finals since 2014, moved a step closer thanks to goals from Moise Kean, Mateo Retegui and Pio Esposito in Tallinn.\n\nThe Italians move three points ahead of Israel in second place in Group I, which offers a play-off spot.\n\nItaly’s meeting with Israel is expected to be a tense affair, surrounded by pro-Palestinian protests and only 5,000 tickets have been sold.\n\nIn Lisbon, Cristiano Ronaldo had a second-half penalty saved by the legs of Republic of Ireland goalkeeper Caoimhim Kelleher but Portugal stole the win in injury time when Ruben Neves scored with a header.\n\nNeves wore the number 21 shirt in tribute to his late international teammate Diogo Jota, who was killed in a car crash this year. Jota wore 21 for Portugal.\n\nThe hard-fought 1-0 victory puts the Portuguese five points clear of Hungary at the top of Group F.\n\nThe Hungarians beat Armenia 2-0 and the Irish and Armenia face a do-or-die match in Dublin on Tuesday.\n\nEuropean champions Spain kept their perfect record in qualifying intact by defeating Georgia 2-0 thanks to goals from Yeremy Pino and Mikel Oyarzabal.\n\nTurkiye remain three points behind them in Group E thanks to a thumping 6-1 defeat of Bulgaria in Sofia.\n\nAlbania have never qualified for a World Cup but have a chance of being in the finals next year after a 1-0 win at Serbia thanks to a goal from Rey Manaj.\n\nThe Albanians are second in Group K behind England and four points clear of third-placed Serbia.",
