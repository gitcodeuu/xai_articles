This categorisation will determine the course of action, including prosecution or reintegration measures under the policy.\n\nThe provincial police, working with the district administration and other agencies, will designate safe locations for dacoits to surrender as outlined in the policy.\n\nAll weapons, ammunition and explosives must be deposited with the police.\n\nUnder the surrender policy, all surrendering dacoits will undergo biometric registration and documentation. In cases where a valid Computerised National Identity Card is not available, the authorities concerned will initiate the process of for issuance of CNICs after due verification.\n\nProtection of families\n\nThe policy guarantees protection for families of surrendered dacoits, ensuring no harassment, unlawful detention, or eviction, and allowing lawful landowners to continue cultivation and livelihood activities without interference.\n\nIt also ensures that families of surrendered dacoits would be provided access to public services, including healthcare and education.\n\nReintegration support\n\nUnder the surrender policy, technical and vocational training opportunities will be provided to surrendered individuals and their families, and agricultural support, including protection of harvests, will be ensured.\n\nEmployment opportunities in development projects in the Katcha region may also be offered to surrendered dacoits after completion of due process of law and their families.\n\nEconomic, social development\n\nThe provincial government in the surrender police also committed to sustained investment in the Katcha area for the revival of closed schools, construction and upgrading of schools, teachers’ recruitment, revival of closed health-care facilities, new hospitals, mobile health units, revival of closed veterinary facilities, provision of better communication services and community welfare programmes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 12th, 2025",
