He was born in Uganda to Indian parents and has become one of the most recognisable progressive voices in New York politics.\n\nMeanwhile, a record 1.2 million people have already voted. More than 165,000 New Yorkers had voted by the second day of early polling, and nearly 80,000 ballots were cast citywide on the opening day alone. According to official figures, this represents a fivefold increase compared with the same stage in the 2021 mayoral race.\n\nPolitical analysts, quoted in various US media outlets, noted that the surge could work in Mamdani’s favour, as his campaign depends heavily on younger, progressive voters who tend to cast ballots early.\n\nMamdani rejected the accusations outright in comments to The New York Post on Sunday, describing himself as “a proud democratic socialist” and saying it was “telling that Republicans in Washington are more concerned about deporting me than ending the ongoing government shutdown.”\n\nHe also dismissed the repeated labelling of him as a communist. “No matter how many times these Republican Congress members or the president of this country call me a communist, it doesn’t make it true,” he said.\n\nIn a separate post on X, formerly Twitter, Mamdani accused his opponents of weaponising his faith and immigration history. “They are trying to scare every immigrant who dares to speak up,” he wrote. “We won’t be intimidated.”\n\nImmigration attorneys and constitutional scholars say the Republican claims have no legal standing. “Denatura­lisation is a serious and rare step reserved for proven fraud or concealment of material facts — not political speech or advocacy,” New York attorney Cyrus Mehta wrote.\n\nHe added that support for Palestinian rights or membership in the DSA cannot legally disqualify someone from citizenship. “Neither of those positions constitutes affiliation with a totalitarian organisation,” he said.\n\n“Every time they attack him, more people show up,” said Meryem Kahloon, an attorney based in Kentucky. “People know what this is really about — it’s about silencing voices like ours.”\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment on whether the agency had received Ogles’s letter, citing a policy of not discussing ongoing or potential investigations.\n\nThe attack on Mamdani began just months after he won the Democratic primary, defeating former New York governor Andrew Cuomo in what analysts described as a political upset. His victory reflected the growing influence of progressive, immigrant, and youth blocs in city politics.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, asked earlier this year about Mamdani’s promise to “stop masked ICE agents from deporting our neighbours,” replied: “Then we’ll have to arrest him.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
