The missiles range from ground-launched cruise missiles to medium-range ballistic missiles.\n\nOn September 30, the Pakistan Army successfully conducted a training launch of a newly inducted, indigenously-produced Fatah-4 cruise missile at a range of 750 kilometres, the military’s media wing said.\n\n“Equipped with advanced avionics and state-of-the-art navigational aids, this weapon system is capable of evading [the] enemy’s missile defence system due to terrain-hugging features and engaging targets with high precision,” the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.\n\nOn May 5, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah series surface-to-surface guided missile with a range of 120 kilometres, as part of ‘Ex Indus’, the ISPR said in a statement.\n\n“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the statement read.\n\nAlso in May, Pakistan successfully tested the Abdali weapon system, a surface-to-surface ballistic missile with a reported range of 450 kilometres, the ISPR said.\n\nLike the Fatah missile launched that month, the Abdali was also launched during ‘Ex Indus’.\n\n“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced manoeuverability features,” the ISPR said in a press release.\n\nLast November, the Pakistan Navy conducted a successful flight test of an indigenously developed ship-launched ballistic missile, the Directorate General Public Relations (Navy) said in a press release.\n\nThe SMASH (Supersonic Missile Anti-SHip) missile, with a range of 350-kilometres, is capable of engaging land and sea targets with high precision.\n\n“The missile system is equipped with a state-of-the-art navigation system and manoeuvrability features,” it added.\n\nLast August, Pakistan conducted a successful training launch of the Shaheen-II surface-to-surface ballistic missile, the military’s media affairs wing confirmed.\n\nThe ISPR said in a statement that the training launch was aimed at the training of troops, validating various technical parameters, and performance evaluation of different sub-systems incorporated for improved accuracy and enhanced survivability.\n\nThe Pakistan Army formed the Rocket Force Command earlier in August to bolster the nation’s defence capabilities. The army’s latest combatant arm was formed following the war with India in May.\n\nThe new command will be responsible for operating conventional missiles — including ballistic, cruise, and possibly even hypersonic — designed to hit targets far beyond the front lines.\n\nThe idea is to strike deep, hard, and without reaching for the nuclear trigger. PM Shehbaz described the force as “equipped with modern technology and having the capability to strike at the enemy from different directions… another milestone in strengthening our conventional warfare capacity.”\n\nNewsKit Publishing Platform",
