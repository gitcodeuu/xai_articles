He said materials science spans an incredible range of applications — from microchips to megastructures, polymers to smart textiles, and superconductors to bio-compatible implants — requiring interdisciplinary collaboration among engineers, chemists, physicists, and computer scientists.\n\nThe PAMF president also highlighted the growing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in materials research.\n\n“AI allows us to analyse vast datasets, predict material properties, and discover new compounds at record speed,” Dr Baig explained. He added that this powerful synergy between AI and materials is opening new possibilities across industries such as aerospace, energy, and biomedicine. This year’s symposium features over 20 international speakers from Russia, Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Turkey, and Norway, with more than 60 oral and 40 poster presentations scheduled across five days.\n\nISAM-2025 will explore frontier areas including AI-driven materials research, additive manufacturing, and advanced materials characterisation.\n\nAlongside the symposium, PAMF and IST are also hosting a Technology Exhibition, RISE 2025, showcasing cutting-edge innovations and linking researchers with industry partners and investors, to promote commercialisation and industrial linkages.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
