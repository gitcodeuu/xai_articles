Even provincial ministers, including Information Minister Azma Bokhari, have filed compl­aints with the NCCIA agai­nst individuals invol­ved in online character assassination.\n\nMs Bokhari recently ann­o­unced plans to move the NCCIA against TV anchor Mubasher Lucman under the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) for alleged defamation.\n\nQuestions, however, are being raised about whether the proposed provincial cyb­­e­rcrime wing is inten­d­ed to target political rivals.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCCIA itself has been struggling with severe manpower shor­t­ages as thousands of complaints pour in each month. With a large backlog and limited resources, the authority has been unable to process cases efficiently.\n\n“In the NCCIA, compla­ints arrive in thousands eve­ry month. Most are related to account hacking, harassment, and financial fraud,” an official told Dawn.\n\n“In harassment cases, many inv­olve the uploading of objectionable photos or videos — often by ex-husbands, ex-fiancés, or boyfriends — to blackmail victims. But the NCCIA lacks the staff and resources needed to handle such a massive volume.”\n\nHe said evidence collection also remains a major challenge due to non-cooperation from some social media platforms, including Faceb­ook, WhatsApp, Google, and Gmail.\n\n“There is no treaty betw­een the government and these companies, so they are not legally bound to share data with the NCCIA. Only in cases involving life threats or ransom do they respond promptly. Besides, the authority is not equipped with the latest software required to trace and verify digital evidence,” he added.\n\nOver the past few years, the number of cybercrime complaints has increased manifold, but the government has not taken steps to strengthen the capacity of the investigating agency, including training officers in countries that have advanced cybercrime systems.\n\n“The government should build the cybercrime setup on the pattern of the FBI,” the official suggested.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
