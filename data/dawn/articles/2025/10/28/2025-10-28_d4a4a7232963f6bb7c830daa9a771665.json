As a result, the fire spread rapidly due to heavy winds.\n\n“It [the fire] engulfed a nearby graveyard, damaging some graves, while around 10-20 huts (makeshift houses) were destroyed,” the spokesperson said. “The fire also reached a nearby housing complex, which prompted citizens to vacate their flats.”\n\nKhan said that 12 to 15 flats that were exposed to fire were vacated and residents were relocated to safe places. He added that 12 fire tenders were engaged to control the blaze.\n\nA later statement from Rescue-1122 said that the fire had been brought under control and that “the cooling process is underway”.",
