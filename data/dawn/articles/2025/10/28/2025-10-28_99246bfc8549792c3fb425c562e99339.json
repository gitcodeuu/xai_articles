While there was no official word on losses, locals reported an intense exchange of fire on Sunday evening.\n\nThe official cautioned that this position of the Taliban “was not in the interest of Afghanistan, Pakistan, or the region”.\n\nThe source added that any further progress in the talks would depend on the “positive attitude of the Afghan Taliban”.\n\nEarlier in the day, the Afghan delegation presented a written response to Pakistan’s demands submitted the previous day, after which Pakistan shared its counter-response.\n\nA second session subsequently began after midday, in the presence of senior Turkish and Qatari mediators.\n\nThere was initial optimism following the exchange of documents and the start of a second session that had not been planned earlier. However, after protracted negotiations, the optimism faded as the Taliban delegation refused to provide any written assurances.\n\nThe Afghan representatives, who were receiving directions from Kabul and Kandahar, appeared to lack the mandate to make decisions, officials said. Their reluctance to provide written commitments was interpreted by the Pakistani side as a sign of unwillingness to act against the TTP and other militant groups with hideouts in Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the two days of talks, Pakistan presented photographic and documentary evidence of TTP, BLA, and other terrorist groups operating from Afghan territory, including details of their leadership and movements. The Pakistani delegation also shared photographs and Afghan identity documents of infiltrators captured during recent border incidents, insiders said.\n\nAt one stage, the Afghan Taliban offered to bring the TTP to the table for direct talks with Pakistani authorities. Islamabad, however, categorically refused, reiterating that it would not negotiate with a terrorist group and that it was the Taliban’s responsibility to end their patronage of the TTP.\n\nEchoing Defence Minister Khawaja Asif’s earlier remarks, Pakistani negotiators told the Afghan side that Islamabad was ready to pay any price to neutralise the threat emanating from Afghan soil for the safety of its people. They cautioned that the Afghan population would suffer because of the Taliban regime’s continued intransigence.\n\nPakistan’s core demand throughout the talks remained decisive action against terrorist proxies operating from Afghanistan.\n\nWhile the dialogue continued in Istanbul, Pakistan’s military reported major infiltration attempts across the Pak-Afghan border, further casting doubt on the Taliban’s intentions.\n\nThe two attempts, occurring in Kurram and North Waziristan, were framed by ISPR as occurring “while delegations of Pakistan and Afghanistan are engaged in talks in Türkiye”.\n\n“This casts doubts on the intentions of the Interim Afghan government regarding its commitment to addressing terrorism emanating from its soil,” the military noted.\n\nThe two-day talks followed the Oct 19 Doha ceasefire, mediated by Qatar, which ended a week of deadly border clashes. Türkiye hosted the current round as part of its expanded mediation role, while Qatar acted as guarantor of the truce and facilitator of dialogue.\n\nThe Pakistani delegation comprised senior security and intelligence officials, including representatives from the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Directorate of Military Operations, and the Foreign Office.\n\nThe Afghan side was led by Deputy Interior Minister Mawlawi Rahmatullah Najeeb and included senior Taliban figures such as Anas Haqqani, Suhail Shaheen, Noorur Rahman Nusrat, and Abdul Qahar Balkhi.\n\nDiplomatic sources said mediators were attempting to keep both sides engaged to prevent a complete breakdown in communication.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 27th, 2025",
