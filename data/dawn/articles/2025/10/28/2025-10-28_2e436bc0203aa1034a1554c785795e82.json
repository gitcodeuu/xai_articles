Additionally, Islamabad and Riyadh are studying several joint economic projects, including signing memoranda of understanding (MoU) for an electricity interconnection project between the two countries and cooperation in the energy field.\n\n“This framework represents an extension of both countries’ efforts to strengthen their fraternal relations and reaffirms their shared vision toward building a sustainable partnership across various economic, trade and investment fields in a manner that fulfils the aspirations of their leaderships and the brotherly peoples of both nations and serves their mutual interests,” the statement read.\n\nCelebrating the announcement, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said: “Another historic chapter unfolds in Pakistan-Saudi relations.”\n\nHe said the developed marked a “high point” in the partnership between the two countries, strengthening trade, energy and investment ties.\n\nParticipating in a discussion at the Ninth Edition of the Future Investment Initiative, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was rich in resources. He said “very honest mistakes” were made in the country’s history but it had learnt from them.\n\n“Important thing is to learn from your mistakes and that is what we are doing. At this point in time, we are undertaking most robust changes and deeprooted reforms which are deeply required,” the premier said, pointing to the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue to tackle corruption.\n\nThe prime minister said Pakistan was among the countries that were most exposed to the effects of climate change through no fault of theirs, adding that the country’s carbon emissions were “less than a fraction of one per cent”.\n\nPM Shehbaz said Pakistan was stuck in a loop of climbing the ladder and coming back down due to repeat climate disasters such as the floods of 2022 and this year.\n\n“This is not acceptable. This is not where humanity should be directed towards. It has to be mutual cooperation,” he said, adding that loans alone were not the solution.\n\nThe premier said that if humanity was to move forward, it would have to do so in unison while sharing its “bounties and grievances together”.\n\nHe said his government would turn Pakistan around with untiring efforts and making the best of its available resources.\n\nPM Shehbaz also said that Pakistan was fast moving towards the increasing adoption of technology and artificial intelligence, though he did also warn about the risks of the latter.\n\nHe said the global north and the global south should sit down and come to an agreement on the equitable distribution of resources for an egalitarian economy for all.\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar met with his Saudi counterpart, Faisal bin Farhan al Saud, in Riyadh to discuss bilateral relations, regional and international developments, according to the FO.\n\nThe pair also discussed the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip and “reaffirmed their shared commitment to cooperation at multilateral fora, including the United Nations”, according to a post on X by the FO.\n\n“They agreed to further deepen the Pak-Saudi multifaceted partnership across all domains, and to continue strengthening the bonds of brotherhood and friendship between the two countries,” the post read.\n\nPakistan and Saudi Arabia have long shared a multifaceted relationship rooted in strategic military cooperation, mutual economic interests, and shared Islamic heritage. These ties have encompassed economic assistance and energy supplies, with Riyadh being a significant source of financial aid and oil for Islamabad.\n\nLast month, the two nations signed a “Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement” in Riyadh, pledging that any attack on either nation would be treated as an act of aggression against both.\n\nA statement from the PM’s office announced the signing of the pact during a meeting at Riyadh’s Yamama Palace, which stated that “any aggression against either country shall be considered an act of aggression against both”.\n\n“This agreement, which reflects the shared commitment of both nations to enhance their security and to achieve security and peace in the region and the world, aims to develop aspects of defence cooperation between the two countries and strengthen joint deterrence against any aggression,” the statement read.\n\nIn 2024, Islamabad and Riyadh signed 34 MoUs worth $2.8 billion, following an earlier deal of 27 MoUs valued at $2.2bn.",
