I got a phone call saying, ‘be lenient, find some time because it’s India’. And it’s like, right, OK. So we had to find some time, brought it down below the threshold.\n\n“The very next game, exactly the same thing happened. He [former Indian captain Sourav Ganguly] didn’t listen to any of the hurry-ups and so I phoned and said, ‘what do you want me to do now?’ and I was told ‘just do him’. So there were politics involved, right from the start,” Broad said.\n\nHe admitted that nowadays, match officials are “either politically savvy or just keeping the head below the parapet”.\n\nBroad also admitted surprise when the ICC contacted him to be a referee given his own run-ins as a player, including refusing to walk, and knocking his stumps down when dismissed in the Bicentennial Test.\n\nBut, as The Telegraph wrote of him, “the ICC noted an individual who could empathise with the pressures players face in the heat of battle”.\n\nIn a refereeing career that spanned 20 years, Broad admitted that he dodged a lot of bullets — “both politically and physically” — the latter alluding to the militant attack he was caught up in when the Sri Lankan cricket team were shot at in Lahore in March 2009.\n\nHe described himself as “someone who believed in right and wrong”.\n\n“In certain parts of the world it’s a bit like the River Ganges — right and wrong are so far apart and there’s a lot of dirty water in between them that you have to deal with, so I think as someone who comes from a right and wrong perspective, to last 20 years in that politically active environment is a pretty good effort,” he said.\n\nBut Broad was not alone when it came to taking an ethical stand.\n\n“I think back to Darrell Hair, who was another one who was a right-and-wrong-type individual, and he was ousted because of his beliefs and that was a big learning thing for me.\n\n“You try to be as honest to yourself as you can be, knowing that politically behind the scenes there are things going on,” he told The Telegraph.\n\n“I think we were supported by Vince van der Bijl (ICC umpires manager) while he was in position because he came from a cricketing background but, once he left, the management became a lot weaker,“ Broad said.",
