The party has denounced the move as politically motivated.\n\nA spokesperson for Jamaat-i-Islami Balochis­tan called on the Balochistan High Court and the Inspector General of Police to intervene, urging an end to what he described as a “practice of lodging false and politically motivated FIRs”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
