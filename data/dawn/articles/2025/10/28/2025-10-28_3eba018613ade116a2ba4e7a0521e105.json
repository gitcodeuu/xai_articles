Our prayers are with all those affected — may the region recover swiftly and with resilience.”  Dar said on X.\n\nOn August 10, a quake of the same magnitude killed one person and wounded dozens of others in Sindirgi, a town nestled in the hills around 138 kilometres (86 miles) northeast of Izmir.\n\nTurkiye is crisscrossed by several geological fault lines that have previously caused catastrophes in the country.\n\nA quake in February 2023 in the southwest killed at least 53,000 people and devastated Antakya, site of the ancient city of Antioch.\n\nAt the beginning of July, a 5.8-magnitude tremor in the same region resulted in one death and injured 69 people.",
