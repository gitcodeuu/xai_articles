If he did not accept, he would be taken to Torkham and deported, the former general said.\n\n“When he was being flown in a helicopter, our people again told him that if you agree, we will drop you somewhere else rather than taking you to the border for deportation.”\n\n“Ultimately, he was taken to the Torkham border and asked to cross over. No one in Pakistan handed him over to the US. When he crossed… Afghan aut­h­orities arrested and han­d­ed him over to American forces. Then he was transferred to Guant­anamo. Pakistan has not done it,” the ex-ISI chief said.\n\nAlthough Pakistan had recognised the Taliban regime and accepted Zaeef as Kabul’s amb­a­ssador, the recognition was withdrawn in the wake of 9/11.\n\nThe former spy chief — who has also served as the head of Military Intelligence and ret­ired as Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee — recalled that despite the breakdown of ties, Zaeef continued to reside in the ambassador’s official residence, where the foreign media would remain camped out.\n\nHe also recounted how Tali­ban leaders started leaving Afgh­anistan after the US began bombing Kabul in October 2001. They had plans to form a government-in-exile in Pakis­tan, with Zaeef as its head, he said.\n\n“A decision was made to ask Mullah Zaeef to leave Pakistan. There were five million Afghans living in Pakistan that time and we did not hand over any Afghan to the US,” he said.\n\nGen Haq said Pakistani officials had advised Zaeef to move to a refugee camp, or any other place, to live as a common Afg­han and stop what he was doing. “This message was conveyed to him through the foreign ministry and other relevant govt functionaries.” However, the former ISI chief said, the erstwhile env­oy refused to leave Islamabad.\n\n“Our people would keep on ask­ing him for months to shift from Islamabad. Other countr­ies would also lodge protests that there are UN resolutions and Pa­­k­­istan had de-recognised the Af­g­han govt [but he is still] he is sitting in Islamabad,” he recalled.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
