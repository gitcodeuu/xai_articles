  "content": "WASHINGTON: Air travel turmoil deepened with more than 1,660 flights delayed nationwide on Monday and more than 8,600 delays on Sunday, with air traffic controller absences surging amid a federal government shutdown now in its 27th day.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration cited staffing shortages affecting flights across the Southeast and at Newark Airport in New Jersey, while the FAA imposed a ground delay at Los Angeles  International that delayed flights by an average of 25 minutes.\n\nSouthwest  Airlines had 45 per cent, or 2,000, of its flights delayed on Sunday, while  American Airlines had nearly 1,200, or a third, of its flights delayed,  according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking website. United Airlines had  24pc, or 739, of its flights delayed, and Delta Air Lines had 17pc, or  610, of its flights delayed.\n\nA US Department of Transpor­tation  official said 44pc of Sunday delays stemmed from controller absence,s up sharply from the usual 5pc. Roughly 13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 Trans­portation Security Administration officers must work without pay and will miss their first full pay cheque on Tuesday.\n\n13,000 air traffic controllers and 50,000 security officers may miss their first full  pay cheque today\n\nThe mounting delays and cancellations are fueling public frustration and intensifying scrutiny of the shutdown’s impact, raising pressure on lawmakers to resolve the budget impasse.\n\nThe federal agencies responsible for indicators of US economic activity, including the Bureau of Labour Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis and Census Bureau, have suspended the collection and distribution of nearly all data for the duration of the shutdown.\n\nMuch of the data from private-sector sources, however, will continue to be issued, although some of those series rely in part on earlier government reports and will also cease publication during the shutdown. The following is the forward calendar of economic reports that have been scheduled to be issued in the coming days, noting which releases will be suspended should the shutdown still be in effect and which will continue to be issued.\n\nThis shutdown isn’t your garden-variety gridlock — it’s already the second-longest in history, and neither side looks close to backing down.\n\nIt is the first significant shutdown driven by Democrats, and only the second time the government has paused over demands to spend rather than save.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
