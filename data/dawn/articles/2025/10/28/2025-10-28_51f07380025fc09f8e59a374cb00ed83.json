The committee chairman directed that a separate meeting be convened to further examine the matter in consultation with all relevant stakeholders.\n\nIt was also noted that the Law Division had raised certain objections to the bill. Senator Zehri requested that copies of the relevant documents and objections be shared with her, on the basis of which the bill was being opposed.\n\nThe committee was also given a detailed briefing on the quota and tender awarding process under the government Haj scheme for 2026, as well as the procurement of goods and services for Haj operations. The ministry informed the meeting that the Procurement Commit­tee comprises seven members and that the process is currently underway. Once completed, all relevant details will be shared with the committee.\n\nThe chairman also inquired about the exclusion of a catering company from the tender process on the grounds of lack of experience.\n\nThe ministry clarified that such matters are reviewed by the Procurement Committee, which examines all relevant aspects before submitting the process to PEPRA for final evaluation and decision.\n\nIt was further informed that companies lacking prior experience are generally awarded smaller tenders initially to help them gain practical experience, as awarding large tenders directly to inexperienced firms may cause operational challenges.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
