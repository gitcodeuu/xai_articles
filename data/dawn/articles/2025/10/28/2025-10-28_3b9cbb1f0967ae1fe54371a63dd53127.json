They’re Pakistan’s strongest foundation,” he said.\n\nMr Muqam said that Pakistan was a unified state, with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa being its integral part.\n\n“No one has the right to spread hatred among people or poison their minds against the country’s institutions. Any attempt to create mistrust against the Pakistan Army and other state institutions serves the enemy’s agenda,” he said.\n\nMuqam said that Pakistan stood at a juncture where unity and national cohesion were more essential than ever.\n\nHe paid tribute to Army Chief Field Marshal General Asim Munir, saying under his command, Pakistan’s armed forces have rendered tremendous sacrifices and defeated enemies on every front.\n\n“If Pakistan stands strong today, it is because of the bravery, discipline and leadership of our armed forces,” he said.\n\nThe federal minister also lauded Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as a “visionary and hardworking leader,” who, he said, was striving for the country’s economic recovery, national unity and public welfare.\n\nHe said the strong coordination and trust between Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal General Asim Munir was a clear sign that Pakistan was moving in the right direction.\n\n“This unity is the true guarantee of Pakistan’s stability and progress,” he asserted.\n\nMr Muqam said that PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, as the prime minister, gave the country motorways, energy projects, peace and development.\n\nHe said the politics of PML-N was based on public service and development and not lies and chaos.\n\nThe minister said that the people of KP must choose between the politics of chaos and hatred and the path of peace, prosperity and progress.\n\nHe said that the PML-N was the only mainstream party which was capable of lifting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa out of socio-economic backwardness and putting it on the road to development.\n\nMr Muqam urged people to unite for the common goal of building a strong, peaceful and prosperous Pakistan, saying this is the vision of PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif, the mission of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the dream of every patriotic Pakistani.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 28th, 2025",
