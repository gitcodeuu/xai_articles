The government should rethink its foreign policy due to which not only Pakistan was facing isolation in the region but also its steps were pushing the Afghan regime into the lap of India.”\n\nFazl was addressing a press conference at Chenab Nagar where he came to address the Annual Khatme Nabuwat Conference organised by Aalmi Majlis Tahaffuz Khatme Nabuwat.\n\nThe JUI leader claimed that people of Afghanistan were pro-Pakistan and not pro-India and matters should not be resolved with use of power.\n\n“We should respect the sovereignty of Afghanistan and it was a matter of concern that visits of Afghan ministers, which were scheduled and confirmed, were cancelled from our side.”\n\nSaying that Pakistan had lost confidence of China and the CPEC was being rolled back, he urged the\n\ngovernment not to sacrifice friendship with China for relationships with the US.\n\nFazl also rejected Punjab government’s decision to award stipend to Imam Masjid, saying that every government tried to purchase the Ulema. He said such a proposal in the KP had been rejected and the same stance would be done in Punjab.\n\nHe said he would not comment on the extension of the army chief as it was an administrative matter.\n\nAbout the Gaza situation, the JUI chief said the hands of Palestinians were tied while Israel was free to bomb and kill innocent people of Palestine.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
