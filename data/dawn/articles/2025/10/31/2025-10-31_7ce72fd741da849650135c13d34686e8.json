Should be a good three games to come.”\n\nAlong with Hazlewood, Xavier Bartlett and Nathan Ellis chipped in with two wickets each.\n\nThe win gave Australia a 1-0 lead in the five-match series after the opening game in Canberra was a washout. The third game is in Hobart on Sunday.\n\n“The way he (Hazlewood) bowled in the powerplay, if you’re four down in the powerplay it’s difficult to recover from that,” said India captain Suryakumar Yadav, whose side slumped to 40-4 after the six-over powerplay.\n\n“Abhishek has been doing this for quite some time now,” he added of the Indian opener.\n\n“He knows his game and his identity and he is not changing it anymore and hopefully he sticks to it and plays many more knocks like this for us.\n\n“I think we need to do what we did in the first game,” Yadav said of the next clash in Hobart. “Bat well when batting first and then come out and defend.”\n\nA minute’s silence was held ahead of the game to mourn 17-year-old Australian Ben Austin who died after being hit by a ball in the nets before a local game in Melbourne on Thursday.",
