The Rescue and Firefighting Services demonstrated exceptional efficiency by responding within the prescribed ICAO response time, swiftly controlling the blaze and initiating rescue and medical evacuation operations.\n\nA key highlight of the exercise was the participation of Army Aviation’s MI-17 helicopter, which conducted an aeromedical evacuation of a critically injured dummy patient to a healthcare facility.\n\nThe exercise was conducted under the supervision and command of Syed Aftab Ali Shah Gilani, Chief Operating Officer/APM, with CFRO Muhammad Tariq serving as the Exercise Coordinator. Both officials emphasised that the success of AIRCON-25 demonstrates the airport’s high level of operational readiness and adherence to ICAO safety standards.\n\nThe chief guest, Professor Muhammad Umar (SI, HI), Vice Chancellor of Rawalpindi Medical University, commended the professionalism, teamwork, and commitment shown by all stakeholders. He noted that such coordinated exercises strengthen national capacity to respond effectively to aviation emergencies and protect human lives.\n\nParticipating agencies included Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Airport Security Force (ASF), Army Aviation, Rescue 1122, Edhi Foundation, Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital, Benazir Bhutto Hospital, Holy Family Hospital, Cantonment General Hospital, Ground Handling Agencies, Airlines Operating Committee, Disaster Management Authority, and various government departments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
