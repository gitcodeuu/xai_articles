  "content": "WASHINGTON: FBI investigations have been slowed or stalled by the second-longest US government shutdown in history, leaving the bureau without funds to pay informants or make undercover drug or gun buys, gaps that an FBI spokesperson said are putting national security at risk.\n\nThe FBI does not provide detailed public information about how its $10.7 billion budget is spent, and it is not clear how much of the total has been held up due to the shutdown, according FBI employees.\n\nThe shutdown, now in its 30th day, has frozen FBI funds used for operational travel, such as when an informant needs to travel to meet a drug supplier or boss, or another investigative subject, the sources said. FBI employees are also without funds to travel outside their local areas.\n\nIn a shutdown, the FBI’s eyes and ears go dark, said retired FBI agent Tom Simon, who worked counterterrorism and criminal cases and at one point worked on a squad recruiting and paying informants. Without funds to pay informants, the Bureau loses its most critical source of real-time intelligence, said Simon, who retired in 2021 after 26 years at the FBI.\n\nNew York declares state of emergency to fund food banks\n\nThe shutdown has furloughed hundreds of thousands of workers, interfered with the collection and distribution of economic data, and has threatened to cut off food and education aid programs. President Donald Trump’s administration has worked to find ways to continue to pay some law enforcement agents and active-duty military, but the FBI employees said that the bureau’s operations are still not fully funded.\n\nNew York Governor Kathy Hochul on Thursday declared a state of  emergency to issue $65 million for assistance to food banks as federal  funding for the national food stamp program is set to lapse on November  1.\n\nOregon and  Virginia  have also issued emergency declarations  to free up funds for emergency food assistance as the federal government  shutdown  imperils  Supple­mental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits  for nearly 42 million Americans.\n\nThe money will go to food banks and pantries, already  under strain.\n\nNew  York receives nearly $650 million in federal funding for SNAP benefits  each month, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nOregon  Governor Tina Kotek on Wednesday pledged $5 million to food banks and  declared a 60-day food security emergency. Virginia Governor Glenn  Youngkin has announced that the state will utilize surplus funds to cover up to a  month of SNAP benefits.\n\nNeither Congress nor the administration  of President Donald Trump has acted to fund November SNAP benefits,  which cost about $8 billion per month.\n\nRadio Free Asia, founded nearly three decades ago to report on China  and other Asian countries without independent media, said on Wednesday it  will halt production after the US government ceased funding.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
