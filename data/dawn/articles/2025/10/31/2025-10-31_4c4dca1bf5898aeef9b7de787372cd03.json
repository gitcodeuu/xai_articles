He was to be replaced by Ali Imtiaz Warraich.\n\nFollowing the Oct 16 meeting, however, Mr Raja had tweeted that the party founder had not ordered any change in the Punjab hierarchy in his presence, adding that they would seek confirmation of this decision from Mr Khan at their next meeting.\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday, however, he clarified that he was told the ‘decision’ to remove both men was conveyed — ostensibly to Barrister Gohar — before he arrived at the prison.\n\nSpeaking to the media on Thursday, Mr Raja disclosed that two lawyers, Ali Imran and Mubashir Maqsood Awan, had met Imran Khan in jail, and later claimed that he had instructed the appointment of Mr Warraich as central Punjab president.\n\nIn a tweet, Mr Raja also claimed that he told the new president, Ali Imtiaz, to start working after being informed that the confusion stemming from the matter had brought the party’s affairs to a standstill in Punjab.\n\nBut the decision to remove the two men was disputed by Imran’s sister Uzma during an interaction with reporters, as well as a tweet from Mr Khan’s official X account — which he doesn’t have access to while in prison.\n\n“I wish to make it clear that Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. They have stood by me with unwavering loyalty and made tremendous sacrifices. I have not issued any orders for their removal,” said the tweet, published on Wednesday.\n\nDiving headfirst into the fray, PTI Punjab Chief Organiser Aliya Hamza tweeted that Imran Khan was the final authority on all decisions, and that she was simply implementing the instructions that had been passed to her.\n\nMs Hamza had earlier appointed Ali Imran as the party’s Punjab spokesman.\n\nWhen approached, party insiders alleged that Ali Imran was a controversial person, being one of the men who ‘misguided’ Salman Akram Raja over Ahmad Chattha’s removal.\n\nSome went as far as to accuse Ms Hamza of ‘playing for the other team’, claiming that she was preoccupied by optics; holding meetings, visiting workers’ homes, holding cake-cutting ceremonies and protests on court premises, while silencing voices being raised from the party’s Punjab media cell.\n\nWhen approached for comment, Aliya Hamza denied any leadership crisis, saying that the PTI Punjab president’s portfolio was still with Dr Yasmin Rashid, adding that Mr Khan had instructed her to serve as acting president after Hammad Azhar stepped down from the role.\n\nAnother dispute that Mr Raja alluded to in his tweets on Thursday was the confusion about who would submit lists for access to Adiala jail.\n\nIt may be recalled that the Supreme Court had recently specified that the party’s secretary general, i.e. Salman Akram Raja, should be the one to submit such lists.\n\nHowever, a tug-of-war over who has the authority to issue these lists erupted after two separate lists were sent to the Adiala Jail superintendent on Oct 29, one by secretary-general Salman Akram Raja and the other by Barrister Ali Zafar.\n\nIn another thread of tweets on Thursday, Mr Raja explained that he had personally messaged Barrister Zafar, informing him that he would send the list. He then claimed to have forwarded the list to the superintendent through TCS, WhatsApp and in person through a lawyer.\n\nHowever, he wrote, “Senator Zafar still sent a separate list of meeting participants”.\n\nParty leaders Dawn spoke to on Thursday seemed embarrassed, saying that such a controversy erupting between such senior party members was tantamount to ‘party ka mazaaq’ (making a mockery of the party).\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
