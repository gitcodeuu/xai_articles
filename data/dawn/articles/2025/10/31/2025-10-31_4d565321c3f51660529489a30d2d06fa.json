PPP won the election, but overnight their victory was taken away; the same script was applied in Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan as well.”\n\nHe regretted that “due to non-political behaviour and mindset, a vacuum was created in AJK, as a result of which, the people are being harmed,” he said, cautioning that it may also “pose a threat” to the Kashmir cause on the international level.\n\nHe asserted that PPP “was the sole party which is capable of representing Kashmir within the country as well as internationally.”\n\nHe vowed to give a “befitting response” to any conspiracy against AJK.\n\n“I promise the people of Kashmir that I will not disappoint you,” he concluded.\n\nWhile a joint no-confidence motion against AJK PM — signed by PPP and PML-N members — has been finalised, the former has yet to announce its nominee to succeed him.\n\nOn Thursday, after days of consultations, President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif endorsed the plan.\n\nSources said the name of the PPP candidate for AJK premiership would most likely be announced today (Friday) after a meeting of the PPP AJK parliamentary party to be chaired by the PPP chairman.\n\nOn Monday, addressing a press conference with Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal and Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah today, PPP leader Qamar Zaman Kaira had said: “It has been decided that the current AJK govt, which we both parties were part of, has become a basis of creating a crisis instead of solving problems.”\n\n“Now there is a consensus of opinion that a no-confidence motion will be brought against it on which the PPP and PML-N will be together,” Kaira added.\n\nMeanwhile, incumbent AJK PM Haq, who at one stage had decided to step down, has decided to remain the chief executive of the state as long as he can.\n\nA source close to him said though the option of resigning before a vote on no-confidence will be open, PM Haq was ready to face the vote.",
