A detailed search revealed that the facility had been hurriedly vacated following the earlier raid.\n\nEvidence recovered from the site confirmed that the smuggled materials had been relocated to warehouses near Sundar Industrial Estate, Lahore.\n\nA coordinated team of the collectorate carried out raids, recovering approximately 12.5 metric tons of acetate tow and over 120 metric tons of cigarette-making materials, including packaging rolls, filters, and foils.\n\nAs part of the nationwide crackdown, the Collectorate of Customs (Enfor­ce­ment), Hyderabad, intensified operations against the smuggling of non-duty-paid cigarettes and illegal tobacco raw materials.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
