During the operation, CTD officials recovered around 2kg of explosive material, 30-bore pistols with loaded magazine, a prima cord, electric circuit components, an electric button, three SIM cards, a detonator, a dry battery, a battery holder, and various electric wires and devices. A mobile phone and Rs35,000 in cash were also seized.\n\nReport said CTD received intelligence regarding a suspicious individual loitering near Chungi No. 07. Upon reaching the location, CTD personnel spotted a man attempting to flee on a motorcycle. He was intercepted and taken into custody. A shoulder bag containing live electronic devices was recovered from the suspect.\n\nCTD immediately summoned Munir Ahmed, Bomb Disposal Technician (BDT) from the Civil Defence Office, Okara, who safely neutralised the devices, which were found to be connected to improvised explosive devices (IEDs).\n\nDuring preliminary interrogation, Junaid Ashraf confessed that the materials had been provided to him by one of his Al Qaeda associates.\n\nCTD Sahiwal registered a first information report under sections 4/5 of the Explosive Substances Act 1908, 13(2a), 20/65 of the Arms Ordinance, 11-N, and 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, on the complaint of Waseem Akhter.\n\nSources informed Dawn that on Thursday, a Sahiwal anti-terrorism court special judge granted CTD a six-day physical remand of the suspect.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
