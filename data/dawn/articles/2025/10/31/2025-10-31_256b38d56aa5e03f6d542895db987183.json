  "content": "Jemimah Rodrigues hit an unbeaten 127 to make India pull off a record ODI chase of 339 against Australia in a thrilling second semi-final of the Women’s World Cup on Thursday.\n\nRodrigues and skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, who hit 89, put on 167 runs for the third wicket as India won with nine balls and five wickets to spare in the outskirts of Mumbai at DY Patil Stadium.\n\nAmanjot Kaur hit the winning boundary to trigger wild celebrations in the Indian camp with smiles and tears of joy in the dug out.\n\nIndia will face South Africa in the final at the same venue on Sunday with the 50-over marquee tournament to get a new champion.\n\nThe hosts made history to get past the previous best chase of 331 by Australia against India in the league stage of this edition.\n\nSeven-time champions Australia faltered in their title defence and suffered their first defeat in the ODI World Cup after 15 victories since 2017 when India beat them in the semi-final.\n\nIndia looked in trouble at 59-2 in the 10th over, but Rodrigues and Kaur rode the storm and then took the attack to the opposition at a nearly-packed house that cheered every run.\n\nA key moment in the game came when Rodrigues survived a dropped catch on 82 by skipper Alyssa Healy who failed to hold on to the ball with her wicketkeeping gloves off Alana King.\n\nAnnabel Sutherland broke through to get Kaur caught out for 89 with India needing another 113 for victory and an exhausted-looking captain trudged back.\n\nAn ice-cool Rodrigues, who was dropped again on 106 by Tahila McGrath, despite Deepti Sharma’s run out on 24 and then Richa Ghosh dismissed for 26, kept anchor and saw the team through.\n\nIndia lost Shafali Verma and then star batter Smriti Mandhana caught behind for 24, a decision reviewed by Healy and replays suggested the ball grazed the bat.\n\nMandhana looked disappointed and trudged back with a wry smile, but had the last laugh when the team won.\n\nAfter Australia elected to bat in overcast conditions, Phoebe Litchfield smashed 119 off 93 balls to steer the team to the mammoth total.\n\nHosts India struck regular blows after a second-wicket partnership of 155 between Litchfield and Ellyse Perry, who made 77 after overturning an early lbw decision.\n\nBut Ashleigh Gardner ensured that Australia’s good start did not go to waste as she contributed a brisk 63 before the last three wickets fell in the final over.\nSpinners Shree Charani and Deepti took two wickets each.\n\nBoth teams wore black armbands in support of promising 17-year-old Australian cricketer Ben Austin, who died Thursday after being struck with a ball while training in Melbourne.",
