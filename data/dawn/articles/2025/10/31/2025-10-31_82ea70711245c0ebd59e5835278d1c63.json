Maybe last season we were more lucky and now we are more unlucky. But, no excuses for our results before people say this.”\n\nFive games into the Premier League campaign, Villa trailed Liverpool by 12 points.\n\nBut the two meet this weekend separated only by goal difference as Unai Emery’s men have hit form just as Liverpool’s losing streak began.\n\nSlot cited Villa as an example to his side of how quickly things can change and the overall strength of the Premier League with only three points separating Bournemouth from Villa in eighth.\n\n“Apart from Arsenal, I think many teams are in and around the same points, so again it tells you also how hard the Premier League is,” added Slot.\n\n“Normally, although with us the run is already quite long, you don’t every time lose a game of football where you create more chances than the other team.\n\n“They [Villa] decided not to make a habit out of that, and let’s hope we decide not to make a habit out of having more chances than the opponent but not winning it.”\n\nThe league’s longest unbeaten run faces a stern test on Sunday when Bournemouth visit the Etihad, hoping to land another blow to City’s title challenge.\n\nThe Cherries have not lost since the opening night of the campaign at Liverpool to spark ambitions of qualifying for Europe for the first time in the club’s history.\n\nCity are six points adrift of Arsenal after a 1-0 defeat at Villa last weekend ended their nine-game unbeaten run.\n\nResurgent Manchester United, who are one place below fifth-placed City but level on points, play at Nottingham Forest on Saturday on a run of three consecutive wins, including a victory at Anfield, for the first time under the Portuguese manager Ruben Amorim.\n\nAfter enduring heavy criticism for his formations and tactics, Amorim took heart in staunchly sticking to his principles as the Premier League club finally show signs of progress.\n\n“It was a journey, a big journey. It was really tough. Good moments, bad moments. I learned a lot, that is really important,” Amorim told reporters on Thursday. “I learned that even in my lower moments I can stick with the thing I believe and that is a good thing for anyone to understand.\n\n“Today, the answer is different from three weeks ago, so it is important to understand that. It is one of the big honours of my life to be here and I want to continue here for many years.”\n\nMikel Arteta’s Arsenal head to Burnley on Saturday high on confidence after four consecutive league victories and conceding one goal in that run.\n\nBurnley, meanwhile, are scrapping for survival. Scott Parker’s team have shown flashes of resilience, including a dramatic win at bottom side Wolverhampton Wanderers last weekend, but they remain 16th with three victories.\n\n“Yes [keep the foot on the gas] and maintain the level of urgency,” Arteta told reporters on Friday. “The concentration, the focus, the ambition we are showing in every game, and every game brings different challenges. Sometimes we have to be very patient and some of the time we have to have a different approach”\n\nThomas Frank has made a fine start to solving Tottenham’s troubles on the road, but is yet to foster the “fortress” he desires at home.\n\nOf Spurs’ 17 points from nine games, 13 have come away from home thanks to impressive wins at City, West Ham United, Leeds United and Everton.\n\nBut Bournemouth and Villa have won in north London either side of a disappointing 1-1 draw against bottom-of-the-table Wolverhampton Wanderers and only a second league win over Chelsea since 2018 would quickly win over any doubters the Dane faces in the Spurs support.\n\nOther fixtures to watch include fourth-place Sunderland’s game against Everton on Monday.\n\nLowly West Ham host Newcastle United on Sunday still looking for a turnaround in form under new manager Nuno Espirito Santo.\n\nSaturday (all times GMT): Brighton & Hove Albion v Leeds United, Burnley v Arsenal, Crystal Palace v Brentford, Fulham v Wolverhampton Wanderers, Nottingham Forest v Manchester United (all 1500), Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea (1730), Liverpool v Aston Villa (2000).\n\nSunday: West Ham United v Newcastle United (1400), Manchester City v Bournemouth (1630).\n\nMonday: Sunderland v Everton (2000).—Agencies",
