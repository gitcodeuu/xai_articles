He quit all royal duties in the wake of the interview and was stripped of his military links and royal patronages in 2022.\n\nThat year, he also settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre, who accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager after being introduced by Epstein.\n\nAndrew had denied ever meeting Giuffre, who died by suicide in April. Her account returned to prominence with the publication of her memoir this month.\n\nRoyal experts said Charles’ actions reflected the threat to the institution, after a move earlier this month to stop Andrew from using his Duke of York title was deemed to be inadequate.\n\nIn recent weeks, Andrew had overshadowed two efforts by Charles to shape cultural and public life — his historic praying with the pope in the Vatican and the unveiling of a memorial to LGBT military veterans who had previously been banned.\n\n“I think that the fact that the royal family decided to actually go against him is quite a big thing,” said recruitment worker Anna Hunter, 29, in London on Friday morning.\n\nGiuffre’s brother, Sky Roberts, told BBC ‘Newsnight’ he commended the king, but said a further investigation was needed. The Rape Crisis charity commended the king and queen for their commitment towards survivors of sexual violence.\n\nBut others questioned whether the royals had taken too long to act. “I don’t know that this move is enough to repair the damage that has been done,” Afua Hagan, a journalist and royal commentator, told Reuters.\n\nSupport for the institution has been in decline over the last decade, with the British Social Attitudes survey showing that 51 per cent of people in Britain thought it was “very important” or “quite important” for Britain to have a monarchy.\n\nThat is the lowest figure reported to date, and reflects a lack of interest from younger generations.\n\nTo their supporters, Britain’s royal family provide stability and continuity in a time of constant political upheaval, acting as a draw to political leaders like United States President Donald Trump.\n\nBut to their detractors, a hereditary monarchy that requires subjects to bow and curtsey is an anachronism that holds the country back, while the lives of leading members, such as William and Kate and their three young children, are followed like a soap opera.\n\nCharles hopes that his very public defenestration of his brother, which a royal source said had been supported by Prince William, will go some way to addressing the problem.\n\n“It’s a ruthlessness on behalf of King Charles, but it’s also ruthlessness on behalf of Prince William,” commentator Hagan said.",
