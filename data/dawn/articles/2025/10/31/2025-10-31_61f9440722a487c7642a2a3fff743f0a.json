Most districts in western and southwestern Balochistan depend on winter rainfall, with annual precipitation ranging between 71 and 231 millimetres.\n\nOverall, these regions have recorded below-normal rainfall (-79 per cent) during the period from May to October 2025. In addition, the number of consecutive dry days has increased markedly, indicating prolonged dry spells across the region.\n\nThis significant rainfall deficit may contribute to the development of drought conditions. The rainfall departures and corresponding consecutive dry days for these regions are summarised in the PMD report.\n\nConsidering climatological patterns and the seasonal forecast for Novem­ber 2025 to January 2026, these areas are expected to experience below-normal rainfall and above-normal temperatures.\n\nSuch conditions are lik­e­­ly to worsen drought across western and southwestern Balochistan. Dist­ricts including Chagai, Gwadar, Kech, Kharan, Mastung, Nushki, Pishin, Panjgur, Qilla Abdullah, Quetta, and Washuk have therefore been placed under “drought watch”.\n\nThe prevailing dry conditions are expected to cause water stress in cultivated areas, primarily due to limited irrigation water availability for Rabi crops.\n\nThe Met Office advised all relevant stakeholders to take precautionary measures to minimise potential impacts on agriculture, livestock, and livelihoods.\n\nThe PMD also advised close monitoring of the evolving drought situation through district coordination committees to ensure activation of early warning systems and effective community-level awareness and information dissemination.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
