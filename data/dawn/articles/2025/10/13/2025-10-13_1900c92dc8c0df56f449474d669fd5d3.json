We’re going to get sturdier Tests in the future where you do have to field for a day-and-a-half,” he told reporters.\n\nThe gutsy batting of left-handed Campbell and Hope allowed them to build the highest partnership for the West Indies for any wicket in Tests this year.\n\nCampbell became the first West Indian to reach fifty in the two-match series with a four off Kuldeep.\n\nHe survived a couple of close lbw calls against off-spinner Washington Sundar early in his innings but went on to dominate the bowling.\n\nHope reached his fifty off Ravindra Jadeja and raised his bat to an applauding dressing room.\n\n“This is the first time we have been able to win a session in the two Tests. It’s all about application,” West Indies spinner Khary Pierre told reporters. “The wicket is going to deteriorate more so the more runs we could pile on, it could be a challenge for the Indian batsmen,” he said.\n\nTagenarine Chanderpaul was the first to fall in the second innings, for 10 to a diving Gill catch off Mohammed Siraj, before Sundar bowled Alick Athanaze for seven on the stroke of tea.\n\nThe West Indies began day three at 140-4 in their first innings in response to India’s 518-5 declared.\n\nLeft-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep struck within 30 minutes, bowling Hope for 36.\n\nKuldeep then had Tevin Imlach given out lbw for 21, a review of the decision showing the ball would have hit leg stump.\n\nJustin Greaves also fell lbw to Kuldeep for 17 and the West Indies were in deep trouble at 175-8 when Jomel Warrican was bowled by Siraj for one.\n\nPierre and Anderson Phillip, who hit 24 not out, put on a stubborn stand of 46 to steer their team to lunch.\n\nJasprit Bumrah bowled Pierre for 23 straight after the break before Kuldeep finally trapped Jayden Seales lbw for 13 for his fifth five-wicket haul in 15 Tests.\n\nSeales was fined 25 percent of his match fee by the International Cricket Council on Sunday for showing unnecessary aggression on Friday’s first day.\n\nIndia won the first Test in Ahmedabad by an innings and 140 runs.\n\nScoreboard\n\nINDIA (1st Innings) 518-5 (Y.
