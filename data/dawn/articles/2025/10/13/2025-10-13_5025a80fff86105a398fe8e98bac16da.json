The officer said six vehicles were partially damaged in the accident.\n\nThe officer said the truck driver, who possessed a ‘fake’ licence, was arrested. He said that the driver was in his early 20s. The heavy vehicle was also impounded.\n\nThe driver claimed that the dumper truck went out of his control because of “brake failure”.\n\nThe officer said it transpired later that it was a mere excuse as the fatal accident was the outcome of reckless and negligent driving.\n\nThe body of the deceased and the injured people were taken to the Civil Hospital Karachi.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 13th, 2025",
