Our teams in Rawalpindi are fully prepared to ensure that every eligible child is vaccinated,” said Deputy Commissioner Hassan Waqar Cheema.\n\nHe added that recent environmental samples indicate the presence of poliovirus, highlighting the need for continued vigilance and public support.\n\nDHA Chief Executive Officer Dr Ehsan Ghani stated: “Polio drops are among the safest and most effective vaccines ever developed. They protect children from lifelong disability. I appeal to all parents to open their doors to vaccination teams and ensure that every child receives the drops; each dose strengthens their protection.”\n\nHe said the dedication of frontline workers, acknowledging their tireless efforts despite challenges.\n\n“Our polio workers are our heroes, reaching every household, often in difficult conditions, to secure a healthier future for our children,” he said.\n\nThe press release said that eradicating polio requires the cooperation of every parent. If all families vaccinate their children and welcome polio teams, we can soon make Pakistan completely polio-free. Rawalpindi will continue to play its full part in achieving this national goal.\n\nGujar Khan\n\nThe polio vaccination campaign was started by administering polio drops to children in a cottage locality of nomads in the vicinity of Jhelum city.\n\nAccording to the district administration, this special polio campaign will begin from Monday (today) and continue till October 16.\n\nAdvisor to the chief minister of Punjab on health, retired Maj Gen Dr Azhar Kiani, formally inaugurated the polio campaign in the district, Jhelum.\n\nHe stated that a polio-free society is the target of the Punjab government; parents and civil society should play their role in the eradication of the menace of polio from Pakistan.\n\nThe advisor was informed by Deputy Commissioner Jhelum Mir Reza Ozgen that 1,192 teams of anti-polio vaccinators have been constituted to administer anti-polio vaccine to 228,000 children in the Jhelum district.\n\nCEO Health Authority, Jhelum, Dr Mazhar Hayat Mian, said that this four-day campaign would achieve maximum targets by reaching door-to-door.\n\nPolio (poliomyelitis) is a highly infectious viral disease that mainly affects children under the age of five. The virus attacks the nervous system and can cause lifelong paralysis or even death in severe cases. It spreads primarily through contaminated water and poor hygiene.\n\nThere is no cure for polio, but it can be prevented completely through multiple doses of the oral polio vaccine (OPV). Each additional dose boosts immunity and protects children from the virus.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 13th, 2025",
