  "content": "Coco Gauff said her victory at the Wuhan Open on Sunday had boosted her confidence after a disappointing run of results, as the American prepares to defend her title at the season-ending WTA Finals in Riyadh next month.\n\nGauff defeated compatriot Jessica Pegula 6-4 7-5 in the final of the WTA 1000 event to clinch her 11th career WTA singles title.\n\nIt was the 21-year-old’s first title since winning the French Open in June, and came after a series of uninspired performances which included a fourth-round defeat by Naomi Osaka in the US Open.\n\n“This definitely gives me a lot more confidence going into the WTA finals, after the way the mid-part of the season went for me, especially in New York,” Gauff told WTA media.\n\n“It gives me a lot of confidence to try to defend that title. Obviously, winning it last year, I know how tough it is to do, so I’m just going to take it match by match and hopefully I can end up with the trophy.”\n\nGauff, who did not drop a set in Wuhan, has won all nine of her finals on hard courts.\n\n“I definitely think it’s the surface I’m most true to,” the two-times Grand Slam winner added.\n\n“Growing up I liked the sureness of bounces and the sureness of knowing when I’m going to stop and when I’m going to go.\n\n“A lot of people think (my best surface) is clay. I don’t know my favourite surface. I feel like it’s still going to be hard court, for me.”\n\nOn Sunday, Gauff became the first woman in a decade to win nine consecutive hardcourt finals, a feat last achieved by Serena Williams, who won 12 between 2013-15.\n\n“I didn’t know that was a stat, so I’ll try not to think about it if I’m in another hardcourt final to keep that record going,” she said.",
