  "content": "LAHORE: A sessions court on Thursday granted post-arrest bail to PTI activist Falak Javed in two separate cases registered against her for alleged misuse of social media platforms against state institutions and a woman provincial minister.\n\nAdditional District & Sessions Judge Dr. Sajida Chaudhry allowed the bail petitions of the activist.\n\nThe judge ordered the release of the activist, if not required in any other case, subject to surety bonds worth Rs100,000.\n\nOn Oct 10, a judicial magistrate had sent Falak Javed on judicial remand in these cases registered by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA).\n\nThe NCCIA had arrested Falak from Islamabad. Her sister, Sanam Javed, has recently been arrested from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and shifted to Kot Lakhpat jail, Lahore, to serve a sentence in a case of May 9 riots.\n\nThe release of Falak is not likely as she is on physical remand with Racecourse police in a case related to attacks on Islamabad police team outside Zaman Park residence of former prime minister Imran Khan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 17th, 2025",
