Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi about “the regional situation.” The timing of the message, which coincided with the announcement of the ceasefire, appeared linked to Qatar’s efforts to mediate.\n\nSaudi Arabia also joined the diplomatic push on Thursday, with Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan speaking by phone with FM Dar to discuss “the regional situation and recent developments,” according to the Foreign Office. While Dar reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to work closely with Saudi Arabia on regional and international issues, the statement did not directly mention Afghanistan.\n\nDiplomatic sources said the main hurdle to the planned dialogue appeared to be internal deliberations within the Taliban’s top leadership. A source in Kabul said that Taliban supreme leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada had yet to give formal approval for his side’s participation.\n\nLate-night reports from Kabul suggested that Mullah Haibatullah had eventually agreed to send Defense Minister Mullah Yaqub to represent the Taliban at the proposed Doha meeting.\n\nThe Pakistani side remained cautious. Officials in Islamabad declined to confirm or deny the meeting. They seemed to be waiting for Kabul’s decision.\n\n“I wouldn’t be surprised if the talks take place,” a Pakistani diplomat said on condition of anonymity, describing the negotiations as “fluid but not off the table.”\n\nCalls for restraint\n\nOn Thursday, Iran and China urged restraint on both sides, calling on them to settle the current conflict through talks.\n\nChina said it supports countries in exercising restraint and realising a full and lasting ceasefire. A foreign ministry spokesperson, when asked about Pakistan and Afghanistan agreeing to a 48-hour ceasefire, said that Beijing stands ready to continue to play a constructive role for continued improvement in the two countries’ relations.\n\n“Pakistan and Afgh­anistan are each other’s neighbours and both are China’s friends. China supports the two countries in staying cool-headed and exercising restraint, realizing a full and lasting ceasefire, properly handling differences through dialogue and consultation, returning to the track of political settlement, and together maintaining peace and stability in both countries and the wider region.”\n\nIran also welcomed the ceasefire, urging dialogue and diplomacy. In a statement, foreign ministry spokesman Esmaeil Baqaei expressed concern over civilian casualties and called for stronger regional cooperation to combat terrorism, while reaffirming Tehran’s readiness “to assist in any effort to maintain calm and reduce tensions between the two neighbouring Muslim countries”.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tasnim News Agency quoted Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian as calling for Muslim unity and dialogue following the ceasefire between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nHe said the renewed tensions between Afghanistan and Pakistan have raised serious concern among regional nations, including Iran, which shares borders with both.\n\nPezeshkian reiterated that Iran would use all available resources to reduce tensions, promote dialogue, and strengthen ties between the two neighbours.\n\nEnemies continually seek to create discord among Muslim nations to weaken them, he said, adding that the region needs peace, cohesion, and cooperation more than ever.\n\nMeanwhile, the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) also called on all parties “to bring a lasting end to hostilities to protect civilians and prevent further loss of life”.\n\nIt also urged both Afghanistan and Pakistan to comply with their obligations under international law “to prevent” more civilian casualties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 17th, 2025",
