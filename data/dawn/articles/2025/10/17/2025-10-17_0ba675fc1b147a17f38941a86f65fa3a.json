Israel’s prison service declined to share Barg­houti’s current location.\\n\\nArab Barghouti said the guards responsible for his transfer were the ones who attacked Barghouti.\\n\\n“He got some ribs broken and (the five other inmates) said that when he got to Megiddo prison, they were shocked that he could barely walk,” Arab said, adding that his father “couldn’t walk for days” as a result.\\n\\nBarghouti is among several high-profile inmates whose release Hamas sought during a recent prisoner exchange conducted under a US-brokered ceas­efire deal.\\n\\nIn a video he shared on social media in August, Israel’s National Security Minister and far-right firebrand Itamar Ben Gvir was seen visiting Barghouti in jail.\\n\\n“Whoever tries to attack the people of Israel, whoever tries to murder our children, whoever tries to murder our women, we will wipe them out”, Ben Gvir is seen telling a physically diminished and handcuffed Barghouti.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 17th, 2025",
