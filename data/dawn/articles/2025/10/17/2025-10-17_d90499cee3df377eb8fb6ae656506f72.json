Retail sugar prices have been fluctuating between Rs170 and Rs200 per kg in various cities.\\n\\nAs part of a trade agreement with the United States, Pakistan’s import of soyabean oil rose significantly in the first quarter of FY26. During July-September (3MFY26), soyabean oil imports reached 52,054 metric tonnes, up 70.89pc from 30,460 metric tonnes recorded in the same period last year.\\n\\nIn terms of value, imports soared to 56.65m, compared to 29.57m in 3MFY25 .\\n\\nThe surge highlights Pakistan’s decision in agreement with the US to increase reliance on soyabean oil for edible oil needs. The value of palm oil imports surged to $1bn 3MFY26, up from $746.411m a year ago.\\n\\nThe import bill for all other food items rose 65.96pc to $689.565m in the 3MFY26 from $415.493m a year ago.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 17th, 2025",
