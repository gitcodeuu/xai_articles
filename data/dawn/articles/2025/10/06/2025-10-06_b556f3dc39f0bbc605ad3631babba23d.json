  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday termed his Malaysian counterpart’s announcement of the import of Halal meat worth $200 million from Pakistan a “welcome step”, which he said would further augment engagement in this sector between the countries.\n\nThe PM’s remarks came in a post on X after he addressed a joint press conference alongside Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya following bilateral talks between the two leaders. PM Shehbaz had also mentioned during the press conference that the Malaysian premier had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan.\n\nPM Shehbaz, who reached Malaysia yesterday on a state visit, further shared in his post that he had a “most productive exchange of views with my dear brother Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim in Putrajaya today”.\n\n“We held wide-ranging discussions on ways to further strengthen our historic partnership — focusing on trade and investment, climate, defence, education, and tourism.”\n\nThe prime minister added that the two leaders also had an in-depth discussion on regional and global developments, including the situation in the Middle East and South Asia. Both prime ministers “reaffirmed our shared resolve to continue working together for the peace, progress, and prosperity of our peoples,” PM Shehbaz said.\n\nMentioning a “gracious and impressive welcome ceremony at Perdana Putra”, he thanked the Malaysian PM for the “warm and generous hospitality extended to me and my delegation”.\n\nMoreover, he said: “We also reflected on Allama Iqbal’s philosophy that the strength of a nation and the destiny of its people lie in the awakening of the self. It is through faith, effort, and perseverance that people shape their destiny.\n\n“Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim and I shared our deep admiration for Allama Iqbal, whose message of faith and self-renewal continues to inspire generations across the Muslim world.”\n\nPM Shehbaz concluded his post saying that he was “looking forward to continued Pakistan–Malaysia collaboration across all areas of mutual interest”.\n\nSeparately, after addressing the Malaysia Business Forum alongside his Malaysian counterpart, PM Shehbaz said he “invited Malaysian companies to seize the immense opportunities Pakistan offers”.\n\nIn a post on X, the prime minister termed Pakistan as a “nation with a skilled and youthful workforce, a rapidly expanding market, and an investor-friendly business environment”.\n\n“With our economic trajectory on the rise and reforms unlocking new sectors, Pakistan offers a highly promising investment destination in the region,” the premier asserted.\n\nAddressing the Pakistan–Malaysia Business and Investment Conference alongside his Malaysian counterpart, the premier said he had a very “constructive and productive” meeting earlier in the day with PM Ibrahim, “who is very keen” that bilateral business relations between the two countries should improve further.\n\n“This seminar is a testimony of our joint desire that this is an area where we must cooperate with each other.”\n\n“We have a youth bulge, which is a challenge and also a great opportunity, and both Malaysia and Pakistan wish to use this asset,” said the prime minister. He added that the youth can be provided training in information technology, artificial intelligence, vocational training and modern skills to transform the challenge into a “great opportunity”.\n\nReferring to the tourism potential of Pakistan, PM Shehbaz said this is another area in which both Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur can cooperate. He suggested that companies from both countries can hold discussions to promote tourism and this initiative has the potential to be a “game changer”.\n\nEarlier, PM Shehbaz said during the press conference with Ibrahim alongside him that Pakistan wanted to “join hands” with Malaysia for mutually beneficial projects which allowed for expertise from the two countries to come together.\n\nThe prime minister began his media talk by thanking Ibrahim on behalf of the people of Pakistan for extending an exceptionally warm welcome to the visiting delegation, and called Malaysia a “second home”.\n\n“This is my first visit to your great country but believe me, ever since we arrived here last night, I [see] familiar faces — very cordial, very warm — as if we have known each other for ages and that stems from sincerity of purpose and very true friendship. It’s like a family reunion,” he said.\n\n“The way you are focused on building your great country into one of the most strong economies in the region and around the globe speaks volumes about your leadership skills, vision, and dynamism,” the premier said.\n\nPM Shehbaz said that he and Ibrahim had “very productive discussions” and they had covered a wide range of matters pertaining to bilateral relations and other international matters during a meeting held prior to the joint presser.\n\n“I am very happy that our views converge on almost all important issues,” he said. He further said that the Malaysian premier’s visit to Pakistan last year was memorable in terms of further cementing bilateral relations.\n\n“Today, I am very happy that you have expressed your vision [on] how to build our economic and trade relations, how to promote joint ventures, how to encourage investment […], how we can benefit from your vast experience in technology, artificial intelligence and other areas of economic growth where Malaysia has done remarkably well,” he said, adding that Pakistan stood to benefit from Malaysian experience in these areas.\n\n“Today, I want to make it publicly known that Pakistan wants to join hands with Malaysia, not only to benefit from your experience, but to have joint ventures, mutually beneficial projects, where Malaysian and Pakistani expertise can come together,” he said.\n\nThe premier noted that there were 150,000 Pakistanis in Malaysia who were contributing to national building efforts. “I think all this put together gives us great encouragement and hope that we can use this potential and make our economies stronger,” he said.\n\nHe noted that Ibrahim, in his remarks, had indicated interest in meat exports from Pakistan to Malaysia worth $200 million. “I am eternally grateful to you […] but let me also make it abundantly clear for our Malaysian importers and officials that this quota of exporting meat will be regulated by a market price mechanism.\n\n“It will be regulated by all halal certification required by Malaysian custom and food authorities […]. I want to assure you that we will make all possible efforts to meet all your terms and conditions and only on that basis, we will achieve not only this quota of $200m, but in times to come, it will increase and have a quantum jump,” he said.\n\nThe premier further said that an Urdu translation had been launched for Ibrahim’s book Script, which detailed the latter’s vision of sustainability, innovation, research and development.\n\n“These are the great virtues and values that brother Ibrahim has inked in this script and I think it will speak across borders for this generation and coming generations,” he said.\n\nHe further said that nations were not built with a magic wand but rather through “hard work, untiring efforts and unwavering commitment”.\n\n“When I leave this great country tomorrow […] I will be going back far more informed than ever before, far more impressed than ever before, far more comforted than ever before,” he said.\n\nTalking about Pakistan’s youth and their potential, he said, “If we can really dedicate ourselves to injecting modern technology in their souls, they will be great hands, great builders of Pakistan. I have no doubt about it,” he said.\n\nHe concluded his remarks by expressing the wish for Malaysia to continue prospering.\n\nLater, the two premiers also witnessed an exchange of memorandums of understanding (MoUs) between Pakistan and Malaysia.\n\nIn his remarks, the Malaysian premier acknowledged the presence and contribution of Pakistani professionals as well as students in Malaysian universities.\n\nHe said that his country had increased the import of rice from Pakistan. He stated there was also an interest regarding importing meat and Malaysia would facilitate this, noting that Shehbaz had mentioned exports worth $200 million.\n\nIbrahim humourously quipped that when he visited PM Shehbaz at his hotel at night, the latter “politely suggested” this but also “harassed”.\n\n“So I certainly welcome that and will discuss with my team,” he said.\n\nCalling PM Shehbaz a “brother”, Ibrahim also said that the former had also encouraged cooperation in information technology and science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).\n\n“Pakistan was among the Muslim countries who were clearly far ahead initially in these fields and that potential is still there. Now that we have secured stability in the country, we certainly will welcome further collaboration,” he said.\n\nRegarding regional and international issues, he said that the two discussed establishing peace in the subcontinent and also joint efforts for countering terrorism.\n\nHe also stated that he was “extremely appreciative” of Pakistan’s stance on the Palestine and Gaza issue.\n\n“We jointly look favourably at the 20-point peace initiative by US President Donald Trump. Although Malaysia does express some concerns, but at least on the point of cessation of hostilities, stopping the insane bombings and killings by the Zionist Israeli regime, that at least is a clear position taken by Arab countries, Muslim countries, and most of the countries in the world now,” he said, expressing the hope for peace in the Palestinian enclave.\n\n“Our joint position in supporting this peace initiative would probably further help this desire to achieve durable peace,” he said.\n\nAfter the presser wrapped up, Ibrahim took to social media platform X and said: “This morning, I welcomed Pakistan’s Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif [who is] starting his three-day visit to Malaysia.”\n\n“He and his delegation received an official welcome, including an honour guard inspection by the Batalion Pertama Rejimen Renjer Diraja. After the ceremony, we held bilateral talks in a warm, constructive atmosphere,” he said.\n\n“The visit enhances Malaysia-Pakistan friendship and opens a new chapter of strategic cooperation for our peoples,” he said.\n\nPM Shehbaz was presented with the guard of honour at the Perdana Putra Complex in Putrajaya, which houses the Malaysian prime minister’s office.\n\nAccording to Radio Pakistan, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Tariq Fatemi are accompanying the premier.\n\nPrior to his departure on Sunday, the prime minister said he was looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views with his Malaysian counterpart on the “common desire” of both sides to enhance trade and economic engagement.\n\n“I will be undertaking an official visit to Malaysia [from] October 5-7 on the invitation of my dear brother, Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim. Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.\n\nImportant global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.\n\nThe Foreign Office (FO) earlier stated that talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.\n\n“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.\n\nIt added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”\n\nPakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gilani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",
