He said that the exchange of fire went on for two-and-a-half hours.\n\n“The unidentified assailants aimed to capture the checkpoint, but their attempt was thwarted,” he said, adding that a search operation was currently underway.\n\n“Three improvised explosive devices (IEDs) have been recovered so far during the clearance operation,” the DPO said.\n\nMeanwhile, KP Governor Faisal Karim Kundi condemned the attack and paid tribute to the martyred cop. In a statement, he also prayed for the speedy recovery of the injured.\n\n“The sacrifices of the police in the war against terrorism will not go in vain,” he added.\n\nThe attack comes a day after a soldier was martyred and another injured when unidentified assailants opened fire on them near KP’s Bannu district.\n\nOn Sept 1, a police constable embra­ced martyrdom and ano­t­her sustained serious injuries in an attack on a police post in Mir Ali.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022 and vowed to target security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nAccording to a Dawn report, KP remained the most affected province last month, but also witnessed intensified counterterrorism actions. The province reported 45 attacks that killed 54 people and injured 49.",
