During the storm, emergency marine rescue teams, aided by local fishermen and volunteers, launched a joint operation using heavy machinery and loaders to recover the stranded vessels.\n\nAuthorities have urged the people to avoid unnecessary visit to coastal areas and strictly comply with safety advisories during this high-risk period.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 6th, 2025",
