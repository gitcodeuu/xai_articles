Greatly looking forward to a comprehensive exchange of views on our common desire to enhance trade and economic engagement as well as bilateral cooperation in various fields,” PM Shehbaz posted on X before his flight.\n\nImportant global and regional matters would also be discussed during the visit, he added.\n\nLater, a post by the PM Office’s official X account confirmed the premier had departed from Lahore for the three-day official visit.\n\nThe Foreign Office (FO) earlier said PM Shehbaz would be accompanied by Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, other federal ministers and senior government officials on the trip.\n\nSharing details of the visit in a statement, the FO said talks between PM Shehbaz and Malaysia’s PM Ibrahim would cover enhancing bilateral cooperation in trade, IT and telecommunications, Halal industry, investment, education, energy, infrastructure, digital economy and people-to-people contact.\n\n“The leaders are expected to witness the signing of agreements/MoUs for cooperation in several existing and new sectors,” the statement read.\n\nIt added, “The visit reflects the strong and enduring strategic partnership between Pakistan and Malaysia, rooted in mutual respect, shared interests, and close cooperation across a wide range of sectors.”\n\nPakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties. In April, Malaysian PM Ibrahim said that Pakistan’s investments in Malaysia have grown to about $397 million; in May, Senate Chairman Yousaf Raza Gillani highlighted Islamabad and Kuala Lumpur’s collaboration in tackling challenges faced by the Islamic world, such as Islamophobia.",
