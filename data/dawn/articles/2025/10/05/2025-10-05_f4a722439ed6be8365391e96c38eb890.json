He said Balochistan’s identity is built on mutual respect and traditions that uphold justice, and values of honour, courage, and hospitality.\n\nIG Tahir said that the people have rendered great sacrifices for peace, and the history written by the martyrs through their sacrifices is commendable. “The forces we are confronting may have deep roots, but we are determined to uproot them completely,” he added.\n\nHe emphasised that Balochistan is a bouquet of diversity, and its beauty lies in upholding the rule of law. “It is essential to distinguish between criminals and ordinary citizens, as in this age, the real strength lies with the people,” he stated.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
