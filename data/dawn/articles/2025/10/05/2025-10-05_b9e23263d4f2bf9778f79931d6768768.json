Soomro and General Secretary Naveed Akbar.\n\nThe members of the committee will forward their suggestions for preparing a charter of demands against the police action on the press club, so that no such act takes place in future.\n\nMeanwhile, the acting president NPC said that they were discussing the situation with other press clubs and with their coordination a strategy will be devised.\n\n“The most important point is that we do not want any such action at any press club anywhere in the country,” he added.\n\nThe leader of Azad Panel Shakeel Qarar said: “We have suggested that a notification be issued to the federal and provincial governments that in future the police or any law enforcement agency will not be allowed to enter any press club even after prior permission.”\n\nHe added that an inquiry should be conducted by an officer of interior ministry and people from the ruling and opposition parties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
