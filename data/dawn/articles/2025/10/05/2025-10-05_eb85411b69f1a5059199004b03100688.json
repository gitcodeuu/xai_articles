Advocate Kakar contended in his petition that despite the passage of considerable time, the Bostan Special Economic Zone had yet to be completed and made fully operational.\n\nDuring the hearing, Saadullah, Chief Finance Officer of the Industrial Estate Development and Management Company of BSEZ, informed the court that the zone has already become partially operational.\n\nHe said that three factories were currently functioning in the zone, while 12 others were under completion and would soon begin operations.\n\nCJ Barech designates two special appellate courts for inheritance cases in Quetta\n\nHe further informed the court that upon completion, these projects would create 15,520 jobs, marking the start of a new era of industrial development in Balochistan.\n\nHe further said that all necessary facilities, including water and power supply, were being ensured.\n\nThe BHC bench, after hearing arguments from both sides, directed the authorities concerned to expedite the remaining work and make the Bostan Special Economic Zone fully operational by Dec 15 deadline.\n\nOfficials said that a large number of industrialists were ready to set up industries in the Bostan Special Economic Zone once it became fully functional.\n\nAppellate courts\n\nChief Justice Rozi Khan Barech has also taken an important administrative step to ensure the effective, timely, and transparent hearing of inheritance cases by designating two special appellate courts in Quetta.\n\nAccording to an official notification, under the directive of the Chief Justice, the courts of Additional District and Sessions Judge-VIII, Quetta, and Additional District and Sessions Judge-X, Quetta, have been assigned to exclusively hear and decide inheritance-related cases.\n\nAs per the decision, all pending inheritance cases previously under other Additional District and Sessions Judges in Quetta will now be transferred to these two designated courts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
