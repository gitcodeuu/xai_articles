Prohibiting first cousin marriage is popular across the main parties, with 76-77pc of Labour, Lib Dem and Tory voters opposed to the practice, as well as 82pc of Reform UK voters.\n\nThe study\n\nThe Genomics Education Programme which is run by Health Education England aims to improve the “genetic literacy” of healthcare professionals and the public. Its 22 September blog post titled “Should the UK Government Ban First-Cousin Marriage?”, stressed that while children of first cousins do face a higher risk of certain inherited disorders, the increase is small and should be tackled through education and voluntary screening rather than bans.\n\nThe document emphasised that first-cousin marriage remains legal in the UK under the Marriage Act 1949 and that the government has “no current plans” to change this.\n\nIt noted that while the risk of a child being born with a genetic condition rises from about 2–3pc in the general population to 4–6pc for children of first cousins, “most children of first cousins are healthy.”\n\nThe guidance also cited research from Bradford suggesting that “endogamy” (marrying within a tight-knit community) may be a more significant factor in genetic risk than cousin marriage itself.\n\nIt further warned that stigmatising the practice can deter couples from seeking help, with the British Society for Genetic Medicine instead advocating premarital genomic testing, targeted education and voluntary counselling as more effective ways to reduce risk.\n\nIn February this year, a BBC investigation showed how cousin marriage plays out on the ground. Its reporting from Bradford, which is home to one of the UK’s largest Pakistani communities found that first-cousin marriage remains “fairly common” but is slowly declining.\n\nThe Born in Bradford study, tracking over 13,000 children, found that about one in six had parents who were first cousins. Researchers found that children of first cousins were more likely to have speech and language problems (11pc versus 7pc for unrelated parents); that they were less likely to reach a government benchmark for “good development” at age five (54pc versus 64pc); and they visited primary care doctors more frequently i.e. about four times a year on average compared to three for unrelated-parent children.\n\nProfessor Sam Oddie of Bradford Teaching Hospitals told the BBC “I’ve seen fatal skin conditions, fatal brain conditions, fatal muscle conditions”.\n\nHe said such conditions were notably more common in Bradford, recalling families who lost several children to the same genetic disorder — “deeply upsetting and hard to comprehend.”\n\nBut the same BBC story underscores that many health professionals, including Prof Oddie, argue it is “an oversimplification” to blame cousin marriage alone. Endogamy, not just direct blood ties, can cluster genetic variants.\n\nEndogamy is not unique to Pakistani communities in the UK. It is an issue too in the UK’s Jewish community and globally among the Amish and also French Canadians.\n\nProf Oddie said it’s simplistic to blame co­usin marriage alone, noting that shared ge­­n­­es within close communities — or endoga­­my — play a major role in inherited disorders.\n\nBBC interviews found more young women choosing “love marriages” as education and social exposure grow, with cousin marriages among Pakistani-origin mothers in Bradford falling from 40pc to 27pc in a decade.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
