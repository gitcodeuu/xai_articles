  "content": "LAHORE: A judicial magistrate on Saturday extended the physical remand of PTI activist Falak Javed for four days in cases of alleged misuse of social media platforms against state institutions and a woman provincial minister.\n\nThe National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) produced Ms Falak before the magistrate at the district courts after the completion of her previous four-day remand.\n\nThe investigating officer sought an extension in the remand for further interrogation and recovery of her mobile phone. A defence counsel opposed the remand request, saying it was unnecessary. He argued that the NCCIA had already obtained a nine-day physical remand of his client in a false case.\n\nHe said the agency had earlier stated that it needed to recover a mobile phone, but no such recovery effort had been made during the previous remand period.\n\nHe asked the court to turn down the prosecution request for further custody and send the suspect to jail on judicial remand.\n\nAfter hearing arguments from both sides, Magistrate Naeem Wattoo extended the physical remand of the suspect for four more days.\n\nPunjab Minister for Information Azma Bokhari got a case registered with the NCCIA alleging that PTI activist Falak Javed doctored her photos and videos and made them viral on social media.\n\nShe also filed a petition in the Lahore High Court complaining about the failure of the agency to arrest the activist. She claimed that character assassination on social media infringed her constitutional rights.\n\nThe NCCIA had arrested Falak from Islamabad.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
