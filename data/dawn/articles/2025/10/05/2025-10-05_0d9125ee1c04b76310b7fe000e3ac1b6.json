The suspects then released the video on social media five years later, leading to the FIR and police action.\n\nPolice traced and arrested three suspects, including the main accused, during raids at three different locations using human intelligence and modern technology. Efforts are underway to arrest the remaining two suspects.\n\nThe victim’s family is reportedly being threatened by influential suspects for a reconciliation. DPO Faisal Shahzad said strict action would be taken against those who sexually assault and harass women and children.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
