Heavy firing took place between the security forces and the terrorists, which continued for several hours.\n\n“As many as 14 terrorists were killed in the gun battle, while 20 others were injured,” the officials said, adding that a large quantity of arms, ammunition, and other equipment was seized from their possession.\n\nThe Zehri operation, they added, was carried out days after security forces killed seven India-sponsored terrorists in an intelligence-based operation in Sherani district of Balochistan.\n\nThey said several hideouts established by the militants in the mountainous terrain were destroyed during the operation.\n\n“Residents of the Zehri area praised the operation, acknowledging the efforts of the security forces in restoring peace and order to the region, which had been disturbed for a long time,” the officials said, adding that the terrorists had been harassing and blackmailing local residents.\n\nOfficials reaffirmed that the security forces remain fully committed to elimina­ting the remaining milita­nts of Fitna al-Hindustan.\n\nOn Oct 1, security forces had killed 13 other alleged terrorists in separate operations in Quetta and Kech districts of Makran.\n\nThe operation in Aghbarg, on the outskirts of Quetta, was conducted a day after a car suicide attack on the headquarters of Frontier Corps (North) that claimed 10 lives, including four security personnel, and left 33 others injured.\n\nSecurity forces foiled the attackers’ attempt to enter the FC headquarters and killed all five terrorists.\n\nFIR registered\n\nMeanwhile, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) of Balochistan Police has registered an FIR against the terrorists involved in the car suicide attack outside the FC headquarters and has lau­nched an investigation.\n\nOfficial sources said the CTD has identified two terrorists who were killed by security forces as they attempted to enter the FC headquarters.\n\nAccording to CTD sources, one of the terrorists belonged to the Mazai Adha area of Qila Abdullah district, bordering Afghanistan, and was identified as Sharifullah. The other terrorist was a resident of Chagai district, but his name has not yet been established.\n\nSources said CTD officials, along with other investigators, have been questioning Sharifullah’s family members. “The terrorist from Mazai Adha was also wanted by security forces in Karachi for his involvement in a previous terrorist attack there,” an official said.\n\nInvestigators have also approached the family of the other terrorist from Chagai. Security officials said the CTD identified both terrorists with the help of Nadra’s fingerprint records.\n\n“The remains of the other terrorists killed in the gun battle with security forces have been sent to the Punjab Forensic Laboratory in Lahore for analysis,” the official added.\n\nMeanwhile, security forces have sealed the area where the FC headquarters is located. Buildings badly damaged by the powerful explosions have also been sealed, and no one is being allowed to enter to access their offices.\n\nThe offices of Daily Mashriq and the private TV channel HUM were among those badly damaged and have been sealed by security forces.\n\nHeavy traffic congestion was reported on several key roads due to the closure of routes passing near the FC headquarters.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
