  "content": "BEIJING: US Open runner-up Amanda Anisimova crushed defending champion Coco Gauff 6-1, 6-2 in 58 minutes on Saturday to reach the China Open final and will face Linda Noskova.\n\nThe 26th-seeded Noskova of the Czech Republic saved three match points in her semi-final to stun fifth seed Jessica Pegula in three sets.\n\n“I felt really good throughout the whole match,” third-seeded American Anisimova, beaten in the final in New York by Aryna Sabalenka a month ago, said.\n\n“All my shots were working today, which is my favourite way to play. Coco’s a really tough player, so I knew I was gonna really have to step it up.”\n\nAnisimova said she was surprised to be back in another final so soon, having taken time off after the US Open and removing a tooth the day of her flight.\n\n“I didn’t really feel like I was match fit ahead of the tournament,” said the 24-year-old, who is one win away from a fourth career title.\n\n“I was like, is it a mistake that I’m flying there [Beijing] and everything’s just off to a bad start? But I think I learned... when I’m not feeling my best physically or I’m facing a challenge, I actually play better because I don’t have as much pressure.”\n\nAnisimova stormed into a 5-0 first-set lead in 15 minutes as an uncharacteristically shaky Gauff hit a slew of shots long and into the net.\n\nThe 21-year-old reigning French Open winner double-faulted twice to give Anisimova two set points before finally getting herself on the scoreboard.\n\nBut it was far too little, far too late.\n\nGauff’s nightmare continued in the second set as Anisimova again raced into a 5-0 lead over her compatriot.\n\nGauff managed to close that deficit by two games but a commanding Anisimova closed out in less than an hour.\n\nIt was Anisimova’s quickest win yet in the Chinese capital, where she pulled off two three-set comebacks.\n\n“She’s definitely one of the best,” Gauff said. “Today I would have liked to perform better and I need to step up my game.”\n\nGauff’s only previous loss on Beijing’s centre Diamond Court had been to Poland’s world number two Iga Swiatek in 2023, also in the semi-finals.\n\n“It’s been a great year for me,” Anisimova, who qualified for the WTA Finals this week in Beijing, added.\n\nNoskova surprised the more fancied American Pegula 6-3, 1-6, 7-6 (8-6) to pull through in 2h 28min and will contest the biggest match of her career on Sunday.\n\n“[Pegula] played incredible,” Noskova, 20, said. “It was just two points away from a win or a lose.\n\n“I’m just too happy that I would win.”\n\nThe two played smart over intense rallies, moving each other around the court.\n\nThe deciding set was a nail-biter, with the more experienced Pegula double-faulting on match point, before they went to a tiebreak.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
