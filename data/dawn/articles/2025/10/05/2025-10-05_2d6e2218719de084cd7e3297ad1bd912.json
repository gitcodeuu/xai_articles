  "content": "LONDON: Declan Rice came back to haunt former club West Ham who were beaten by Arsenal in the Premier League, while Manchester United handed Ruben Amorim some relief with a 2-0 win over Sunderland on Saturday.\n\nIn Mikel Arteta’s 300th match in charge, the Gunners proved far too strong for the struggling Hammers in a 2-0 win at the Emirates Stadium to further their ambitions of a first Premier League title for 22 years.\n\nVictory came at a cost for Arsenal as captain Martin Odegaard was forced off injured before half-time for the third time this season.\n\nHowever, the strength in depth now on offer to Arteta has made light of Arsenal’s injury troubles.\n\n“We dominated and fully deserved to win this,” said Arteta. “To go top of the table after some big fixtures over the last week and some injuries… we were able to respond.”\n\nRice, who left West Ham for a club record 105 million ($141 million) in 2023, ended the visitors’ resistance by blasting high into the net on the rebound after Alphonse Areola parried Eberechi Eze’s drive.\n\nBukayo Saka made the points safe midway through the second half from the penalty spot on his 200th Arsenal appearance after Jurrien Timber was brought down by El Hadji Malick Diouf.\n\nThe defeat leaves West Ham still languishing in the relegation zone.\n\nAmorim conceded on the eve of Sunderland’s visit to Old Trafford he needs results quickly to avoid becoming the latest United manager to suffer the sack.\n\nThe Portuguese had taken just 34 points from his previous 33 Premier League games in charge, but enjoyed a rare convincing win to give him some breathing space over the international break.\n\n“We were a competitive and adult team today,” said Amorim. “We need to do this kind of performance away as well — it’s our responsibility to play like this.”\n\nBefore kick-off Old Trafford fell silent to honour the victims of a terror attack on a Manchester synagogue this week.\n\nAmorim’s bold calls with his team selection paid off as goalkeeper Senne Lammens kept a clean sheet on debut, while Mason Mount justified his place over Matheus Cunha with the opening goal.\n\nMount eased the home fans’ tension with a fine finish from Bryan Mbeumo’s cross on eight minutes.\n\nBruno Fernandes saw a shot tipped onto the woodwork by Robin Roefs as United dominated the first half.\n\nBenjamin Sesko doubled the Red Devils’ advantage with a predatory finish from a long throw-in for his first Old Trafford goal since a 74 million move from RB Leipzig.\n\nThere was nearly a twist at the end of the half as Sunderland were initially awarded a penalty, only for VAR to intervene due to insufficient contact by Sesko on Trai Hume.\n\nSunderland began the weekend in fifth after a dream start to their return to the top flight, but the Black Cats were dealt a reality check to end their four-game unbeaten run.\n\nTottenham Hotspur showed their newfound defensive resolve under Thomas Frank to end Leeds’ year-long unbeaten league run at Elland Road with a 2-1 victory.\n\nMohammed Kudus’ first goal for Spurs secured all three points after Noah Okafor cancelled out Mathys Tel’s opener for the visitors.\n\n“That feeling to get over the line, to get three points, was big,” said Frank after his side moved up to third.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 5th, 2025",
