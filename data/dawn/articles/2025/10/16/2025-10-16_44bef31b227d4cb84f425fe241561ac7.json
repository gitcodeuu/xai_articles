In Nowshera, Akora Khattak, Khairabad and Turkaman refugee camps have been de-notified, while orders for the closure of Lakhti Banda, Kata Kani, Kahi, Darasmand and Thall camps in Hangu and Gamkol, Oblen Ghaulam Banda and Chichanacamps in Kohat have been issued.\n\nSimilarly, Jalala and Baghicha in Mardan, Barakai and Gandaf in Swabi, Koga in Buner and Chakdara, Timer and Toor camps in Dir have been de-notified.\n\nOn Oct 13, the ministry had ordered immediate de-notification of 10 camps in several districts of the province.\n\nThe camps included Zafarabad in Dera Ismail Khan, Dabara in Tank, Gandi Khan Khel in Lakki Marwat, Bizenkhel in Bannu, Khaki, Ichrian and Bareri in Mansehra, Utmanzai and Munda in Charsadda and Zangal Patai in Malakand.\n\nOn Sept 25, de-notification of Panian, Basu Mera and Padhana camps in Haripur, Kessu in Chitral and Barawal in Upper Dir was ordered.\n\nAn official of the Commssionerate of Afghan Refugees told Dawn that there were 43 refugee camps across the province.\n\nHe said that five camps were de-notified in September, 10 on Oct 13 and the remaining 28 on Oct 15. There are no more such camps in the province.\n\nThe official said that 350,000 Afghans holding PoR cards lived in those camps.\n\nHe said that though those camps had been de-notified, refugees still lived there with the exception of the Kessu camp in Chitral from where all occupants had been evicted.\n\nRegarding evictions from the remaining camps, he said that it was likely to take some time.\n\nAn Oct 6 report of the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) Pakistan said 702,643 Afghan nationals had returned to Afghanistan since April this year, with 80,302 of them being deported.\n\nIt said that during the reporting period, returns decreased by 28pc, while deportations increased by 82pc, compared to the previous bi-weekly period.\n\n“The surge in deportations is primarily linked to intensified crackdown operations in Balochistan and Punjab, with the sharpest rise in arrests recorded in Chaghi district,” IOM said.\n\nIt said that since Sept, 15, 2023, 1.5 million individuals had gone back to Afghanistan, while 750,685 had returned since Jan 1, 2025.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 16th, 2025",
