The Turkmen Ambassador assured full cooperation in strengthening bilateral cultural and tourism ties and emphasised joint efforts to enhance economic development through shared cultural and artistic initiatives.\n\nOn the occasion, Secretary of the National Heritage and Culture Division Asad Rehman Gillani described the forthcoming signing of the cultural cooperation programme as the beginning of a new era of friendship and people-to-people engagement between Pakistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nHe added that the proposed agreement aims to promote mutual understanding and enhance cultural relations through extensive collaboration in arts, literature, and heritage preservation. It envisions exchange programmes for artists, writers, and cultural delegations, as well as exhibitions, conferences, and joint artistic events highlighting the shared heritage of both nations.\n\nThe cooperation also includes the translation and publication of literary works, the organisation of cultural seminars, and participation in each other’s national cultural festivals, further strengthening the historic bonds between Pakistan and Turkmenistan.\n\nThe minister said that Pakistan and Turkmenistan enjoy long-standing relations rooted in shared history, religion and culture.\n\nHe emphasised the need to further strengthen people-to-people ties by promoting cultural exchange alongside ongoing cooperation in trade and business sectors.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project, the minister termed it a vital regional initiative and expressed hope for similar collaborations in the fields of culture and heritage. He noted that, with the flight duration between the two countries being less than two hours, both sides should take advantage of direct connectivity to boost tourism and cultural exchange.\n\n“Pakistan has a rich civilizational heritage of over 5,000 years, including the Gandhara, Harappa, and Mohenjo-Daro cultures, which are worth exploring,” he added.\n\nThe minister also proposed organising joint cultural festivals in both Pakistan and Turkmenistan to showcase the diverse traditions and art forms of the two nations. Aurangzeb Khan Khichi extended an invitation to Turkmenistan to participate in the upcoming Lok Mela 2025, scheduled from November 7 to 16 at the Lok Virsa Complex, Islamabad. The Ambassador accepted the invitation and assured the participation of a Turkmen delegation in the event.\n\nThe minister further announced plans to host a special cultural evening at the Pakistan National Council of the Arts (PNCA), featuring performances and exhibits representing Pakistan’s rich heritage, and invited the Turkmen Ambassador to attend alongside other diplomatic representatives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 16th, 2025",
