During these operations, 970 terrorists were killed, while 311 Pakistan army personnel were martyred.\n\nHe added that in 2024, 14,535 intelligence-based operations were conducted in KP during which 769 terrorists, including 58 Afghan terrorists, were killed and 272 army and FC personnel and 140 policemen were martyred, while 165 civilians lost their lives.\n\nLt Gen Chaudhry attributed the surge in terrorist incidents across the country to several factors, including the non-implementation of the NAP, the politicisation of counterterrorism efforts, India’s use of Afghanistan as a “base of operation for terrorism” in Pakistan, the supply of modern weapons to militants in Afghanistan, and a “terrorism-crime nexus” that he said enjoyed “complete local and political backing.”\n\nOn October 8, security forces neutralised 19 “Indian-sponsored terrorists” during an operation in KP’s Orakzai district, according to the ISPR. However, eleven military personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, were martyred.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nadir Guramani.",
