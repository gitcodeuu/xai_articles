Therefore, an inquiry was ordered to ascertain responsibility and take appropriate action against the officials involved in the ‘misstatement’.\n\nIt may be recalled that the Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet (ECC) in its meeting on Aug 26 approved a summary of the Petroleum Division regarding recovery of about Rs47.5bn petroleum levy collected from consumers but defaulted by CPL since 2019. With a late payment surcharge, the total claimed amount had reached about Rs60bn.\n\nThe Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) had mediated a settlement framework to bail out CPL from payables to the Petroleum Division and the Government of Pakistan. The ECC had then approved the settlement framework prepared in line with the decisions of SIFC Apex/EC/IC for recovery of the principal amount of petroleum levy duty audited to date, and authorised the Petroleum Division to sign the proposed deed of settlement with CPL”, according to an official statement.\n\nThe ECC had also directed that “the entire outstanding amount of petroleum levy be recovered strictly in accordance with the terms of the settlement”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 16th, 2025",
