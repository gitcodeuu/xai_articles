The venue is named after the premier.\n\nIndia has its eyes on a bigger prize, having submitted a formal letter of intent last year to the International Olympic Committee to host the 2036 Summer Olympics.\n\nAhmedabad got the nod over the Nigerian capital Abuja.\n\nIndia’s home minister Amit Shah described the announcement as “a day of immense joy and pride for India”.\n\n“Heartiest congratulations to every citizen of India on Commonwealth Association’s approval of India’s bid to host the Commonwealth Games 2030 in Ahmedabad.”\n\nThe future existence of the Commonwealth Games was in doubt last year when the movement struggled to find a replacement host for 2026 after the Australian state of Victoria withdrew for cost reasons.\n\nThe Scottish city of Glasgow stepped in and will stage a slim­med-down version of the multi-sport format, meaning Britain will have hosted two editions in a row, after Birmingham in 2022.\n\nThe 2030 Games will mark the centenary of the inaugural event held in Hamilton, Canada, in 1930.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 16th, 2025",
