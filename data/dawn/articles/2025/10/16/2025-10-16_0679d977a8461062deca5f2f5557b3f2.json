But I believe I will achieve something big,” she said.\n\nDespite the discomfort, it is important to her to cover up when she plays rather than wear shorts and a t-shirt.\n\n“Sometimes it feels like I want to open the hijab, but I must not expose my hair,” she said. “I have to put it on as a good Muslim.”\n\nHijabs, which cover the head and neck, were barred by soccer’s world governing body FIFA on safety grounds in 2007, a move which led to the Iranian women’s team being banned from a qualifying match for the 2012 Olympics.\n\nThe ban was relaxed in 2012, and the hijab fully permitted in 2014.\n\nNouhaila Benzina of Morocco became the first player to wear a hijab at a senior women’s World Cup in 2023.\n\nMuhammed’s mother, Kehinde Muhammed, has faced criticism for allowing her daughter to play.\n\n“So many people discouraged me,” she said.\n\n“But I respect my children’s decisions. I support her and keep praying for her.”\n\nShe sews hijabs to match team jerseys.\n\n“I counsel her that this is the normal way you’re supposed to be dressed as a Muslim,” she said.\n\nModel Queens coach Muyhideen Abdulwahab is trying to change perceptions.\n\n“We go out to meet parents, to tell them there are laws in place for modest dressing,” he said. “Despite that, some still say no.”\n\nTeam member Bashirat Omotosho, 19, is passionate about the sport but cannot always attend training because she has to help her mother sell puff puff, a fried dough snack, at a roadside stall in order for the family to make enough money.\n\nSometimes the team jog past the stall as part of their training, which is frustrating for her.\n\n“Training is often in the morning, but I have to be here,” she said, handing snacks to customers.\n\n“I can’t leave my mum - this is how I earn money.”\n\nHer mother, Titilayo Omotosho, was initially hostile to the teenager’s sporting ambition.\n\n“Why would a lady choose football?” she asked.\n\nBut after her husband gave his blessing, the mother relented.\n\n“Seeing other Muslim girls succeed, like Asisat, encouraged us to let her play,” she said, referring to Nigeria star Asisat Oshoala, the record six-time African Women’s Footballer of the Year.\n\nOshoala, who does not wear a hijab on the pitch, comes from Lagos, in southwest Nigeria, where Islam is less conservative.\n\nDespite growing interest, female participation in soccer remains low in Ilorin, said Ambali Abdulrazak, a local football administrator.\n\nThe Nigeria Women’s Football League (NWFL) is among Africa’s strongest, led by southern clubs from cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt, where infrastructure and societal support are robust.\n\nIn contrast, northern and central regions face cultural and religious barriers, though grassroots efforts are expanding.\n\nNationwide, the sport’s popularity is rising, driven by the success of the national women’s team, the Super Falcons, as well as increased sponsorships and grassroots programmes.\n\nNWFL viewership has grown by 40 per cent since 2020, with match attendance up 35pc in 2024, according to Nigerian media company iTelemedia, which tracks audience trends across local leagues.\n\nAs the sun dipped, Muhammed and her teammates jogged across a sandy pitch at the local school during one of their training sessions, their voices rising between bursts of a muezzins call to prayer from a nearby mosque.\n\nOn August 29, Muhammed captained the Model Queens in a youth tournament final. They lost. At the whistle, she high-fived teammates and cheered as they received runners-up medals. Later, alone in her room, she broke down in tears over the defeat.\n\nBut the support of her family and her faith have kept her going.\n\n“I really love this sport. I have passion for it,” she said. “Since my parents support me, there is nothing stopping me. Football is my dream.”\n\nHeader image: Model Queens Football Academy team players Bashirat Omotosho, 19, and Maryam Muhammed, 17, practice before the Youth Tournament final match with Kwara Ladies FC in Ilorin, Kwara State, Nigeria, August 29, 2025. — Reuters",
