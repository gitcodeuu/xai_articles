  "content": "TORONTO: Australian Mollie O’Callaghan broke the short course 200m freestyle world record for the second time in a week on Friday, winning in 1min 49.36sec at the World Cup stop in Toronto.\n\nO’Callaghan sliced 41-hundredths of a second off the world record of 1:49.77 she set in Westmont, Illinois, just six days earlier — a victory that made her the first woman to break 1:50 in the event.\n\nHungarian Hubert Kos and Canadian Josh Liendo followed up world record swims on Thursday with victories.\n\nOne day after posting a world record of 1:45.12 in the 200m backstroke, Kos won the 50m back in 22.67sec.\n\nThe Olympic gold medallist remained unbeaten in backstroke competition in the three-meet World Cup series.\n\nCanadian Josh Liendo continued his scintillating form in front of home fans with a 100m freestyle victory in 45.30sec.\n\nLiendo, who won 100m butterfly silver at the Paris Olympics, had set a short course world record of 47.68 in the 100m fly on Thursday — when he also won the 50m free.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",
