The ISPR did not immediately issue a statement on the Bajaur operation.\n\nLeaders of the Bajaur Aman Jirga staged a demonstration in the Umary area on Saturday evening, demanding that authorities avoid harm to civilians during operations.\n\nIn Hangu, four militants were killed in an exchange of fire in the rugged mountains on Friday evening. The operation was launched after an improvised explosive device (IED) attack that martyred SP (Operations) Asad Zubair and two guards. The SHO of the Doaba police station was injured in the ensuing action.\n\nThe area has witnessed repeated attacks attributed to the banned TTP in recent months.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",
