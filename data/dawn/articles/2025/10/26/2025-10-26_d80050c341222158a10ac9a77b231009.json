But, “they never received it”, he claimed.\n\nOn the matter of the National Finance Commission (NFC), the KP CM expressed disappointment that an NFC meeting still had not been called and vowed to bring up the matter of KP’s share post-Fata merger at the session.\n\nAt a rally in Khyber yesterday, CM KP made similar remarks, claiming that the federal government owed the province Rs550 billion, and called for immediate reconvention of the NFC meeting.\n\nCM Afridi further alleged today that the Centre was “building a narrative” against him, owing to my middle-class and tribal area background“.\n\n“Top ministers have made accusations against me,” he said, reiterating that he was “a soldier of Imran Khan,” and had not said anything unpleasant in return.\n\nHe recalled that “when I went to Adiala jail to meet Imran Khan, I received a call from the prime minister, who congratulated me and I requested him to arrange a meeting with Khan … to which he said I will ask and then tell.”\n\n“Who is he going to ask exactly?” the CM questioned.\n\nOn the matter of KP’s natural resources, the chief minister said he stood with the people of KP, stressing that “only the people of KP have a right to decide where their resources should go”.",
