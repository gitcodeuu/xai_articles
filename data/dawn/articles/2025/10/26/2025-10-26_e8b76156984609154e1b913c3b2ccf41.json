Moscow also targeted Kyiv, killing two people and wounding 12 others, mayor Vitali Klitschko said.\n\nJournalists heard the distinctive whirring of missiles and powerful blasts at around 4am. Emergency services shared photos of firefighters battling flames as major fires broke out in the Desnyansky and Darnytsky districts.\n\nRussia fired nine Iskander-M ballistic missiles and 62 attack drones, the Ukrainian air force said, adding it had downed four ballistic missiles and 50 drones.\n\nThe United States and the European Union announced new sanctions this week on Russian energy aimed at crippling Moscow’s war economy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",
