Today, the UN Security Council and the UN no longer function,” Lula said.\n\nHe also appeared to take a swipe at Trump, saying, “For a leader, walking with their head held high is more important than a Nobel Prize”.\n\nTrump and Lula have begun to patch up their differences after months of bad blood over the trial and conviction of Trump’s ally, the far-right former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro.\n\nTrump has instituted a 50 per cent tariff on many Brazilian products and imposed sanctions on several top officials, including a top judge, to punish Brazil for what he termed a “witch hunt” against Bolsonaro.\n\nBrazil’s apex court sentenced Bolsonaro to 27 years in prison last month for his role in a botched coup bid after his 2022 election loss to Lula.\n\nBut relations between Trump and Lula began to thaw when the two 79-year-old leaders had a brief meeting on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly last month.\n\nThey then spoke by phone on Oct 6 and first raised the possibility of meeting at the ASEAN summit.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",
