I have a clear idea of where we have to improve but that hasn’t been the case in other games,” Liverpool manager Arne Slot said.\n\n“We didn’t do the basics right today.”\n\nDango Ouattara volleyed Brentford in front following a long throw-in by Michael Kayode was flicked on and Kevin Schade went through to make it 2-0 in the 45th minute.\n\nMilos Kerkez replied for the visitors in first-half stoppage time with his first Liverpool goal from Conor Bradley’s cross.\n\nBut Igor Thiago restored Brentford’s two-goal advantage from the penalty spot and although Mohamed Salah gave Liverpool hope with a clinical finish, they could not force an equaliser in 10 minutes of stoppage time.\n\nMan United earn third league win in a row\n\nManchester United are beginning to show signs of consistency, with Matheus Cunha, Casemiro and a Bryan Mbeumo double helping them secure a third successive league win for the first time since Februsry 2024.\n\nCunha arrowed home a sublime 24th-minute strike into the bottom corner and Casemiro doubled the lead 10 minutes later with a deflected shot before Mbeumo’s well-taken third put the hosts in complete command.\n\nDanny Welbeck pulled one back for Brighton with a free kick, however, before Charalampos Kostoulas’s stoppage-time header ensured a nervy finish.\n\nWith Brighton committing everyone forward in search of the equaliser, however, Mbeumo fired a fine strike into the roof of the net to confirm United’s win.\n\n“I enjoy it a lot here,” Mbeumo told Sky Sports.\n\n“It hasn’t been easy at the start. It’s a new environment, a new expectation but I think with the link up with the team, everything is going the right way.”\n\nSunderland shocked Chelsea when substitute Chemsdine Talbi curled in a winner deep into stoppage time.\n\nThe visitors had gone behind in the fourth minute when Alejandro Garnacho claimed his first goal for the London side, but the lead was cancelled out by Wilson Isidor in the 22nd minute.\n\nThe game appeared to be heading for a draw until Talbi collected a pass from fellow substitute Brian Brobbey and placed his low shot perfectly to grab his first goal for Sunderland.\n\n“It’s a good performance, especially after the early goal,” Sunderland coach Regis Le Bris said.\n\n“We won three points. We are happy with the way we played. It is important to grab this opportunity when possible.”\n\nChelsea’s loss left them eighth in the table.\n\nNewcastle were heading for a frustrating draw before captain Guimaraes scored at the death. William Osula drove to the edge of the box, but his shot was parried into the path of the Brazilian who poked the ball home from close range.\n\nJacob Murphy had scored for the Magpies in the 18th minute, before Sasa Lukic levelled after halftime.\n\n“Late goals don’t just affect the game you’ve won, they affect mood and belief going forward,” Newcastle manager Eddie Howe said.\n\n“It can have a big knock-on effect. We’ve had heartbreak the other way. This felt like a massive moment for us. We found a way to win.”\n\nNewcastle climbed to 11th in the table and Fulham fell to 16th. Brentford are 10th.",
