  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Petroleum Division is failing to enforce regulatory discipline related to national security in the upstream oil and gas due to the unauthorised sale of shares of a company.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) has stopped the change of the board of directors and the sale of shares of Frontier Holdings Ltd (FHL) and Spud Energy Pvt Ltd (SEPL) to a foreign buyer, while the Directorate General of Petroleum Concessions (DGPC) was failing to scrutinise the sale proceeds.\n\nThe court has also stopped all actions related to the transfer of the existing shareholding or control structure of the two companies.Advertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPauseLoaded: 0.00%0:00Remaining Time -10:03MuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Despite repeated attempts, neither the DGPC nor the Petroleum Division has issued any official statement to date regarding the measures taken to ensure full compliance with the Islamabad High Court’s directive.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 26th, 2025",
