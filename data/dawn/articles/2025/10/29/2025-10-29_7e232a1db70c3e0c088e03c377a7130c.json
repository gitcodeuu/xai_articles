It focuses on conserving and restoring the country’s unique Chilgoza pine forests across Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, Baloch­istan, and Gilgit-Baltistan, FAO said.\n\nPine nuts generate over $25 million annually for Pakistan. FAO’s approach is now being scaled up with national resources, including $3m from the KP Forestry Department.\n\nAccording to FAO, restoration of 20 per cent of degraded Chilgoza forests has been achieved throu­­gh income-generating activities for local communities, such as pine nut processing units.\n\nSpeaking at the award ceremony, PM’s adviser Dr Syed Tauqir Hussain Shah said the initiative had restored 3,800 hectares of degraded forest land.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
