Additionally, Islamabad and Riyadh are studying several joint economic projects, including signing memoranda of understanding (MoUs) for an electricity interconnection project between the two countries, and cooperation in the energy field.\n\n“This framework represents an extension of both countries’ efforts to strengthen their fraternal relations and reaffirms their shared vision toward building a sustainable partnership across various economic, trade and investment fields in a manner that fulfils the aspirations of their leaderships and the brotherly peoples of both nations and serves their mutual interests,” the statement read.\n\nCelebrating the announcement, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said: “Another historic chapter unfolds in Pakistan-Saudi relations.” He said the developed marked a “high point” in the bilateral partnership in trade, energy and investment.\n\nParticipating in a discussion at the 9th Edition of the Future Investment Initiative, PM Shehbaz said Pakistan was rich in resources. He said “very honest mistakes” were made in the country’s history but it had learnt from them. “Important thing is to learn from your mistakes and that is what we are doing. At this point in time, we are undertaking most robust changes and deeprooted reforms which are deeply required,” the premier said, pointing to the digitisation of the Federal Board of Revenue to tackle corruption.\n\nThe prime minister said Pakistan was among the countries most exposed to the effects of climate change through no fault of theirs, adding that the country’s carbon emissions were “less than a fraction of one per cent”.\n\nHe said Pakistan was stuck in a loop of climbing the ladder and coming back down due to repeat climate disasters such as the 2022 and 2025 floods. “This is not acceptable. This is not where humanity should be directed towards.” If humanity was to move forward, it would have to do so in unison while sharing its “bounties and grievances together”, he added.\n\nHe said Pakistan was fast moving towards the inc­r­e­asing adoption of technology and artificial intelligence, though he did also warn about the risks of the latter. He said the global north and the global south should sit down and come to an agreement on the equitable distribution of resources for an egalitarian economy for all.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
