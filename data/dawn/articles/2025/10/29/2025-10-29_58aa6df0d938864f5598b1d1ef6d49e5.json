This decision will be strictly implemented,” he affirmed.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, JAAC leader Shaukat Nawaz Mir criticised the absence of a structured market system in Muzaffarabad, saying that without proper vegetable, livestock and wholesale markets, inflation could not be effectively controlled.\n\n“The business community stands with the people, but it is primarily the government’s responsibility to regulate markets, ensure food availability and stabilise prices,” he remarked.\n\nMr Mir pointed out that hotel associations in all districts and tehsils had already prepared official rate lists and no hotel owner would be allowed to overcharge.\n\n“Transparent rate lists will be displayed everywhere to facilitate tourists and prevent complaints,” he added.\n\nMr Ilyas said that although the hotel sector generated substantial revenue and provided thousands of jobs, it had never been treated as a priority industry by the government.\n\n“In other countries, whenever the business community faces a crisis, the government steps in with relief packages. Unfortunately, in AJK, no such measures have ever been taken,” he regretted.\n\nCiting the Supreme Court of Pakistan’s decision to “abolish the GST in Gilgit-Baltistan,” he urged the AJK government to adopt similar reforms to improve service delivery.\n\nMr Ilyas thanked JAAC for including the hotel industry’s longstanding issues in their charter of demands.\n\n“If the government, traders and public representatives work together, AJK can once again regain its reputation as a paradise-like tourist destination,” he said.\n\n“Our collective goal is to establish a sustainable system for prosperity, employment generation and tourism promotion, which will not only strengthen businesses but also improve public life,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
