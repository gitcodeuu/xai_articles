He noted that Pakistan faces a disadvantage compared to Indian exporters, who are allowed to export bone-in meat.\n\nMr Khan proposed a two-step approach — first, a short report within four days to identify immediate measures to enhance exports, and second, a comprehensive policy framework within 10 days to guide sustainable growth in the sector.\n\nMr Tanveer said his ministry was working on disease control and livestock improvement, with FMD containment and feedlot fattening projects already underway in Punjab and plans to expand similar initiatives to other provinces.\n\nTo coordinate policy and implementation, four committees were formed to focus on disease control, breed improvement, feedlot development, and government facilitation. The Ministry of Science and Technology will also be engaged to ensure compliance with Halal certification and international quality standards. The Sindh government will play a role in logistics and port facilitation.\n\nMr Kamal said Malaysia represents a viable opportunity for Pakistan’s meat industry, provided the country can improve price competitiveness, supply reliability, and compliance with quality standards.\n\nHe directed all ministries and stakeholders to submit their recommendations within the set timelines and emphasised the need for coordinated refo­rms to strengthen Pakis­tan’s meat export base.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
