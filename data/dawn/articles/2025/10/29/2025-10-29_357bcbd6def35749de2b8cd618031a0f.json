During the Question Hour, several treasury lawmakers, including Ahsan  Raza and Saeed Akbar Nawnai, criticised the responses submitted by the  communications department, terming them “routine replies meant only to  fulfil formality.”\n\nDefending his department, Punjab Communications  Minister Sohaib Bharth asserted that he personally monitors all  development projects across the province. At this point, Speaker Khan  cautioned that “any form of misleading information in the House would be  considered a serious matter.”\n\nRaising concerns about the CCD’s  operations, Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) legislators Mumtaz Chang and  Shazia Abid said if the department’s performance was as effective as  claimed, then it should also launch a robust operation against dacoits  in the Katcha areas. They added that “serious reservations exist  regarding CCD’s ongoing actions.”\n\nPPP legislators want CCD action in Katcha area\n\nMeanwhile, the House unanimously  passed a resolution, calling for strengthening Article 140-A of the  Constitution to reinforce local governments.\n\nThe Constitutional  Resolution under Article 144 (1) for consideration by the National  Assembly and Senate seeks a Constitutional Amendment in Article 140-A to  strengthen Local Governments and create a separate chapter titled  “Local Governments” in the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of  Pakistan.\n\nThe resolution was proposed by the Punjab Local Government  Caucus and co-sponsored by Ahmad Iqbal Chaudhry (PP-54) and Ali Haider  Gillani (PP-211).\n\nThe House also approved, by majority vote, six bills, including the National University of Toba Tek Singh Bill 2025.\n\nDuring  the proceedings, treasury MPA Shagufta Faisal extended congratulations  to Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on her birthday. After completion of the  agenda, the Panel of Chairpersons Shaukat Raja adjourned the session for  an indefinite period.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
