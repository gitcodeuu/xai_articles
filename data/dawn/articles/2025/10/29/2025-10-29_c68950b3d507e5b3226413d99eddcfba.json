Very special day and I’m so glad we won in the end.”\n\nWolvaardt set up victory with her first World Cup century as she lay the foundations of the mammoth total in a 116-run stand with fellow opener Tazmin Brits, who made 45.\n\nWolvaardt reached her 10th ODI ton and then switched gears to take the attack to the opposition in the final few overs, ending with 20 fours and four sixes in her 143-ball knock.\n\nShe reached the top of the tournament batting chart with 470 runs including one hundred and three half-tons in eight matches.\n\nThe elegant batter started with a crisp cover drive off Lauren Bell for a four and the opening pair hit regular boundaries to put England on the back foot.\n\nEngland left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone dented South Africa’s surge with two wickets in one over as she bowled Brits for 45 and three balls later sent back Anneke Bosch for a duck.\n\nEngland struck regular blows but Wolvaardt stood firm and put on key partnerships with Kapp, who hit 42, and then Chloe Tryon, who made an unbeaten 33.\n\nWolvaardt finally fell in the 48th over off Bell and walked back to a standing ovation and handshakes from the opposition players.\n\nEcclestone stood out with figures of 4-44 after she was cleared to play despite suffering a shoulder injury in the previous game.\n\nSouth Africa pace spearhead Kapp rattled England with two wickets in the first over as she bowled Amy Jones and Heather Knight — both out for ducks.\n\nAyabonga Khaka dismissed Tammy Beaumont for a golden duck in the second over and despite a rearguard by skipper Nat Sciver-Brunt and Alice Capsey the England innings fell apart.\n\n“An incredible two innings from South Africa,” said Sciver-Brunt. “We were not at our best today and to beat the best teams, you have to put a whole game together. Did not do that and hugely disappointed.”\n\nSciver-Brunt, who top-scored with 64, and Capsey, who made 50, put on 107 runs for the third wicket but after their departure the South African bowlers hit back.\n\nKapp dismissed Sciver-Brunt and then got Sophia Dunkley and Charlie Dean caught behind to be on a hat-trick, which was avoided by Ecclestone.",
