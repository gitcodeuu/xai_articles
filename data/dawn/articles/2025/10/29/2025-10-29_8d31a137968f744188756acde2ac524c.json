In the future, deeper private-sector inclusion and continued reforms in taxation and regulatory efficiency will be key to sustaining this momentum”, he said\n\nThe survey also found investor perception of business risk to have shifted favourably, moving from a predominantly high-risk to a medium-risk outlook, reflecting improved macroeconomic management and relative stability. However, the findings also indicated that structural bottlenecks continue to constrain Pakistan’s investment potential. “Among the most critical concerns, federal–provincial coordination received negative feedback from 57pc of respondents”.\n\nAccording to the survey, 96pc of respondents reported higher energy costs, 95pc faced increased wage expenses, and 91pc cited higher domestic raw material costs. Over 80pc expressed concern over delayed tax refunds, which in most cases take more than two years to process. Furthermore, over half of respondents indicated that commercial disputes take over five years to resolve, highlighting the need for judicial reform and more efficient dispute resolution.\n\nMembers’ perceptions of Pakistan’s economic outlook have improved noticeably since 2023. When asked about their sector-specific expectations for the next two to three years, 58pc of respondents now foresee global economic growth, a significant rise from 40pc in the previous survey. “This improvement mirrors gains in key macroeconomic indicators, including greater inflation stability, exchange rate management, and stronger capital market performance”, the OICCI said.\n\nThe survey participants also recommended enhancing Pakistan’s digital and regulatory landscape, supported by stronger human capital and a comprehensive, sector-focused investment policy. They emphasised developing non-IT industrial capacity to diversify growth.\n\nStrengthening Pakistan’s global image was also seen as vital to attracting long-term FDI.\n\nOn global perception, 82pc of respondents noted that negative international coverage continues to influence investment decisions, highlighting the need for a proactive communications strategy to project Pakistan’s economic recovery and reform progress at global forums.\n\nThe survey’s recommendations call for broadening the tax base, ensuring policy consistency, strengthening coordination between federal and provincial governments, and enhancing intellectual property rights enforcement to sustain investor confidence and attract long-term FDI.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
