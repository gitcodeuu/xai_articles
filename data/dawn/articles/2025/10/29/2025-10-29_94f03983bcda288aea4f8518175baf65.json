The Constitution has linked all departmental and policy decisions to the cabinet’s approval otherwise they don’t have any legal standing,” she said.\n\nThe opposition lawmaker said that any further delay in the cabinet’s formation would be tantamount to inviting the country’s president to exercise the power granted under Article 234 of the Constitution to grant the province’s administrative powers to the centre.\n\nShe demanded of the chief minister to at least form a small cabinet comprising 5-7 ministers to run the affairs of the province.\n\nMs Malik also urged the PTI’s provincial leadership to take decisions by itself, wondering how long it will pursue politics centered on a personality.\n\nMPA Afshan Hussain said that the house’s debate on people’s issues had no impact as there was no minister to respond to questions.\n\nShe complained the new chief minister had failed to form his cabinet for the last 16 days, leaving no one to update lawmakers about the affairs of the education, health and other departments.\n\nOpposition MPA Shahjehan said that the absence of the cabinet had brought the province’s affairs to a standstill.\n\nHe said the province had long been facing multiple serious issues including the delicate law and order situation, flour shortage and high prices of essential goods, but the ruling party wasn’t taking them seriously.\n\nParliamentary leader of the opposition PPP Ahmad Karim Kundi said that people’s problems stood unresolved, so the house had become irrelevant in the eyes of the people. He said lawmakers had failed to satisfy people through resolution of their issues.\n\n“If the chief minister is not allowed to meet his jailed leader, then who stopped this government from strengthening the local government system, controlling flour prices and providing clean drinking water to people,” he said.\n\nMr Kundi urged the ruling PTI to do away with confrontational politics, which, he said, would harm the province and its people.\n\nDuring the sitting, lawmakers from Swat and Buner districts demanded of the government to increase compensation payment for the damage caused by the recent floods.\n\nMPA Fazal Hakeem from Swat and MPA Gurpal Singh from Buner said Rs300,000 compensation for a destroyed house and Rs100,000 for destroyed shops was a meagre amount compared to the destruction.\n\nThe chair adjourned the session until next Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2025",
