He had also been involved in attacks on two police posts in the district, in which a constable was martyred, the statement saod.\n\nThe other was involved in several attacks and targeted killings on CTD and district police in 2023, including attacking and injuring a constable in November of that year, according to the CTD.\n\n“Two Kalashnikovs, six magazines, 23 rounds, two hand grenades, two mobile phones and two cards of the banned TTP were recovered from the possession of the slain terrorists,” the press release said, adding that additional police and CTD personnel had launched a search operation in the area to arrest the escaped terrorists.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.\n\nA major of the Pakistan Army was martyred and seven terrorists were killed during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) by security forces in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan district yesterday, according to the media wing of the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).\n\nThe incident occurred a day after the ISPR reported that 11 security personnel, including a lieutenant colonel and a major, had been killed in an exchange of fire between the forces and TTP terrorists in KP’s Orakzai district.",
