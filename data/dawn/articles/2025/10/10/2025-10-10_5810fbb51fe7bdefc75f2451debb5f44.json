WAPDA later began the Mangla Dam Raising Project, which not only regained the lost capacity but also enhanced it to 7.5 MAF.\n\nOriginally built with an installed power generation capacity of 1,000 MW, the dam is currently undergoing a phased refurbishment project. According to Wapda, the Mangla Refurbishment Project will increase the power generation capacity from 1,000 MW to 1,310 MW.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 10th, 2025",
