Dengue is a high risk disease as it can cause significant drop in platelet count,” said Dr Najum F. Mahmudi, senior family physician running a private practice near Hill Park, seconding the opinion that the viral flu was highly contagious and often affecting several members of the same family.\n\nSelf-limiting illness\n\nAccording to Dr Altaf Hussain Khatri, another senior general physician, most viral respiratory illnesses are self-limiting and only needed supportive care.\n\n“This means patients should be advised rest, hydration and prescribed medicines for symptomatic relief. Antibiotics are not effective in viral illnesses.”\n\nWarning signs, he said, included high or persistent fever lasting more than five to seven days, acute weakness, difficulty in breathing, severe throat pain and chest pain.\n\n“Patients may develop secondary infection/s and they must seek immediate medical intervention in case symptoms persist,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 10th, 2025",
