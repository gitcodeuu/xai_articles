The remai­ning four operational aircraft will continue to be used by the department for anti-locust operations.\n\nIt was noted that previous attempts to auction these aircraft had been unsuccessful, leading to the decision to donate them instead.\n\nEarlier, in his opening remarks, Prime Minister Shehbaz highlighted recent incidents in which army officers and soldiers embraced martyrdom while conducting operations against terrorists.\n\nPM Shehbaz remarked that facilitators were providing shelter to terrorists coming from across the border, and warned that such elements would no longer be spared. “The situation had reached a critical point. The martyrs have drawn a line with their blood while defending their country, and this line cannot be crossed,” he said.\n\n“The sacrifices of the martyrs will be remembered forever,” he asserted, adding that the country’s achievements on the economic and diplomatic fronts would mean nothing if terrorism was not eliminated.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 10th, 2025",
