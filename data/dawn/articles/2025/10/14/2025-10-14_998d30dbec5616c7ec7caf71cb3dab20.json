Iceland had two shots on target and scored two goals,” France coach Didier Deschamps told TFI.\n\n“But we have another point on the board and next month will be decisive.”\n\nGermany have now recorded three consecutive victories in Group A after beginning their campaign with a defeat in Slovakia last month.\n\nNewcastle United forward Woltemade headed in the only goal of the game as Germany beat Northern Ireland 1-0 in Belfast, and Julian Nagelsmann’s team are top of the group with nine points.\n\n“It was a very important three points for us,” Woltemade told Germany’s RTL, adding that “in this atmosphere and in a bit of an ugly game, you have to win and we did well”.\n\nSlovakia sit second only on goal difference as they defeated Luxembourg 2-0 at home, Adam Obert and Ivan Schranz scoring the goals in the second half.\n\nThe 12 group winners in European qualifying will go to the World Cup, with runners-up continuing on to play-offs set for next March — the meeting between Germany and Slovakia in Leipzig next month will therefore be decisive.\n\nBelgium have almost qualified from Group J after Kevin De Bruyne converted two penalties in a 4-2 win over Wales in Cardiff.\n\nJoe Rodon had given Wales an early lead but De Bruyne’s spot-kick double came either side of a Thomas Meunier goal.\n\nNathan Broadhead pulled it back to 3-2, only for Leandro Trossard of Arsenal to seal Belgium’s victory at the death.\n\nRudi Garcia’s Red Devils — who beat Wales 4-3 at home in June — now know one win from their two games next month away to Kazakhstan and at home to Liechtenstein will clinch top spot.\n\nMeanwhile, Wales must try to catch second-placed North Macedonia, who were held 1-1 at home by Kazakhstan on Monday with Enis Bardhi replying for the hosts after Dinmukhamed Karaman’s opener.\n\nSwitzerland could have qualified from Group B with the right combination of results, but will have to wait until next month after a 0-0 draw in Slovenia.\n\nThe Swiss are now only three points clear of Kosovo, who beat Sweden 1-0 in Gothenburg thanks to a solitary strike by Fisnik Asllani of Hoffenheim.\n\nSweden’s campaign has proven to be a disaster as they sit bottom of the section with just one point despite having Viktor Gyokeres and Alexander Isak starting together up front — they have failed to even score in their last three matches.",
