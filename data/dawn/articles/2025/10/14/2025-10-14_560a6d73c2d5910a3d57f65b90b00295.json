Without President Trump, there would be no peace.\n\n“President Trump has broken down barriers, has built bridges, has put people together, and actually together with Egypt, together with Qatar, together with Turkiye and other countries he mentioned them as well — from Saudi Arabia, to (the United Arab Emirates), to Indonesia, to Bahrain, to Jordan, all these countries here in the Middle East who have supported this process.\n\n“But, under the leadership of President Trump, it happened, and now we can really write some new pages. Pages of togetherness, of peace, in a region which really, really needs it.”\n\nSeparately in a post on LinkedIn, Infantino thanked Trump for inviting him to the summit. “I made it clear to all world leaders that FIFA is here to help, to assist and to put ourselves at disposal for whatever we can do to make sure that this peace process comes to fruition and to the best possible end.”\n\nFIFA has faced repeated calls to act over the war in Gaza, with Palestinian officials pressing for Israel to be suspended from international football.\n\nLast week, Amnesty International sent a letter to FIFA and UEFA calling on them to suspend the Israel Football Association.\n\nThe issue has been under review by FIFA for months, but no decision has been taken. Infantino has consistently said such matters require consensus with the confederations and must be handled with caution.\n\nThe comments came a day after FIFA Vice President Victor Montagliani noted that any decision over Israel’s participation in European competitions, including World Cup qualifiers, was a matter for UEFA to decide, effectively putting the onus on the European body.\n\nInfantino said last week that football could not solve conflicts, but it must carry a message of peace and unity as Israel’s genocide in Gaza and other global tensions fuel calls for the sport to take a stand.",
