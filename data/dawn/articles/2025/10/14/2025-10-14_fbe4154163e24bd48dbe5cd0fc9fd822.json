  "content": "KARACHI: Hutchison Ports Pakistan, the country’s only deep-water container terminal, has berthed MSC MICOL, the largest vessel in the country’s history.\n\nThe 400-metre-long container ship has a capacity of 24,070 TEUs, making it one of the most advanced vessels globally and the largest to call at a Pakistani port.\n\nThe berthing of MSC MICOL marks a significant milestone, highlighting the terminal’s capacity to handle ultra-large vessels, said a press release.\n\nHandling larger vessels enhances trade efficiency and helps reduce freight costs, supporting the country’s export competitiveness and lowering import expenses.\n\nMaritime Minister Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry termed the berthing a historic event that strengthens Pakistan’s position as a regional shipping hub.\n\nSeparately, two subsidiaries of Pakistan National Shipping Corporation — Karachi Shipping and Lahore Shipping — signed agreements to acquire two Aframax tankers, LORAX and NAFSIKA, with deadweight tonnage of 109,990 and 112,051 tonnes, respectively.\n\nPNSC earlier approved a $193.1 million plan to expand its fleet to 30 vessels by 2026.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 14th, 2025",
