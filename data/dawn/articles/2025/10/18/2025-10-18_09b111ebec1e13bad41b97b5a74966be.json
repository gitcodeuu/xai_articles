Officials on both sides have said they could be extended from Saturday, adding senior intelligence officials from both countries were part of the talks.\n\nEarlier, Zabiullah Mujahid, the spokesperson for the Taliban government, had also confirmed that talks between the two countries would take place in the Qatari capital.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, Mujahid said, “As it was promised that negotiations would be held with the Pakistani side, a high-level delegation of the Islamic Emirate, led by the Minister of Defence Maulvi Sahib Muhammad Yaqub Mujahid, left for Doha today.”\n\nReports from Afghanistan suggest that the Taliban delegation would also include intelligence chief, Mullah Wasiq, besides the defence minister.\n\nMeanwhile, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar said that Pakistan struck verified camps of the outlawed Gul Bahadur group in border areas of North and South Waziristan districts along the Pak-Afghan border.\n\nIn a post on X, he said that during the 48-hour ceasefire, terrorists operating from Afghanistan attempted to launch multiple terrorists attacks inside Pakistan, which were effectively countered by security forces.\n\n“During the effective responses by security forces, more than 100 kharjis were sent to hell,” he said. He said that terrorist also carried out an improvised explosive device (IED) attack in North Waziristan in which civilians and a soldier were martyred while multiple others were injured.\n\n“Against kharjis of Gul Bahadur Group, precision strikes were undertaken last night. In these precision strikes, [a] minimum [of] 60-70 kharjis and their leadership have been sent to hell based on confirmed intelligence reports,” the minister said.\n\n“All speculations and assertions being made regarding targeting of civilians are false and meant to generate support for terrorist groups operating from inside Afghanistan,” he said.\n\n“Pakistan sincerely believes that [the] path forward lies in resolving this complex issue of Indian-sponsored terrorism emanating from Afghan soil through talks and control of non-state actors by Afghan authorities. However, Pakistan has all the rights to safeguard its territorial integrity and the lives of the people of Pakistan, and we shall not allow terrorists operating from inside Afghanistan to live in peace,” he said.\n\nPakistan had again targeted terrorist hideouts in Afghanistan on Friday. Incidents were reported from the Angoor Adda region and across Afghanistan’s Urgun and Barmal districts of Paktika province as precision strikes were conducted against hideouts of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group.\n\nThe attacks came on the heels of an attack targeting a military installation in North Waziristan, and just hours after Islamabad and Kabul extended a two-day ceasefire.\n\nThe Afghanistan Cricket Board (ACB) also said that it was pulling out of a T20I tri-nations series scheduled to be held in Pakistan next month after alleging that three cricketers were killed in a strike.\n\nThe fresh exchanges on Fri­day night had cast a shadow over the ceasefire, which had been exte­nded just a few hours earlier, as well as the planned Doha talks.\n\n“The ceasefire has been mutually extended by both Pakistan and Afghanistan till the end of the talks in Doha, Qatar. The talks are ready to begin [on Saturday],” a security source said on Friday evening at the conclusion of the initial 48-hour truce, which had been in effect since Wednesday.\n\nThe two-day ceasefire was largely observed without violations, but the dialogue initially agreed at the time of its announ­cement, aimed at addressing what Pakistan’s Foreign Office described as a “complex but solvable iss­ue”, failed to take place during that period.\n\nEarlier in the day, at his weekly media briefing, outgoing Foreign Office spokesman Shafqat Ali Khan reiterated: “Afghanistan has become a central breeding ground for global terrorism.”\n\nHe warned the international community against complacency, adding, “We do not have to wait for a big disaster happening at the global scale before we take remedial action. This fire will spread. This has to be stopped.”\n\nNo bilateral initiative for talks emerged during the first phase of the truce. How­ever, Qatar, which along with Saudi Arabia had pushed both sides to halt hostilities, offered to host their meeting in Doha. The talks, initially slated for Thursday or Friday, were postponed by a day due to logistical issues and reluctance within the Taliban leadership to engage, sources said.",
