These people were not buried underground, they were kept in the occupation’s refrigerators for long months,” he added.\\n\\nGraphic images circulating online show decomposing bodies bound with rope and blindfolded, with what forensic reports have identified as signs of physical torture.\\n\\nSome clips showed Palestinians viewing screens showing images of the corpses, attempting to identify if the bodies belonged to loved ones.\\n\\nEuro-Med Human Rights Monitor noted that remains released from Israel “bore clear marks of hanging, rope imprints around their necks, injuries from close-range gunfire, bound hands and feet with plastic restraints, and blindfolds”.\\n\\nIt added that corpses showed signs of being crushed by tanks, while others indicated that individuals were subjected to fractures, burns and deep wounds.\\n\\nIsmail Al-Thawabta, director general of the Government Media Office in Gaza, also mentioned suspicions of organ theft by Israel.\\n\\n“When we examined the bodies, we found that large parts were missing. There were half bodies, bodies without heads, without limbs, without eyes, and without internal organs,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that there was a high possibility that Israel stole these organs.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 18th, 2025",
