The committee underscored the necessity for a robust monitoring system and strict compliance with government policy to protect families from exploitation and ensure that quality education remains accessible, not just a privilege for the affluent.\\n\\nPeira directed to come up with a comprehensive fee policy to ensure transparency, fairness and accountability\\n\\nMeanwhile, the committee discussed missing facilities in many rural areas schools in Islamabad.\\n\\nThe members criticised the lack of basic facilities in numerous schools, particularly those previously identified by the committee after visiting their premises.
