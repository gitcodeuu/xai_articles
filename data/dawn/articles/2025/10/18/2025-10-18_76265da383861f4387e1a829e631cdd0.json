The two leaders expressed home that “it would help bring an immediate end to the suffering of the Palestinian people, ensure unhindered humanitarian access to Gaza, and pave the way for lasting peace and stability in the region”.\n\nConcluding the call, both leaders agreed to remain in touch.\n\nDuring a state visit by the premier earlier in October, the two leaders resolved to reignite bilateral cooperation and move towards a more aggressive and forward-looking policy, including the possibility of collaboration under the umbrella of the Asean economic bloc.\n\nIn a joint statement issued following their bilateral meeting in Indonesia during Shehbaz’s visit, both prime ministers expressed satisfaction with the strong and ongoing defence collaboration under the Joint Committee on Defence Cooperation (JCDC) established in 1997.\n\nAnwar and Shehbaz also agreed to explore collaboration in healthcare, pharmaceuticals and medical devices with the aim of enhancing public health and commercial exchanges in these sectors.\n\nPakistan and Malaysia maintain strong economic, religious and cultural ties.
