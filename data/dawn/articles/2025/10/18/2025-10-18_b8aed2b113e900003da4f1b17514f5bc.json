The chair also proposed diploma courses for judges of special courts and regular counselling sessions for stress management.\\n\\nThe committee appreciated these forward-looking recommendations and decided to constitute a committee comprising all chief justices of the high courts to review the proposals and submit consolidated recommendations for discussion in the next meeting.\\n\\nEfforts of HCs acknowledged\\n\\nOn safeguarding judicial independence, the CJP acknowledged the efforts of all high courts for notifying Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) that provide a mechanism for an institutional response to extraneous influence on judges at the district level. The chair further observed that similar safeguards were necessary to protect the independence and integrity of judges of the superior judiciary.\\n\\nIn this regard, the committee was apprised by the chair that he has proposed amendments to the Code of Conduct for Judges to establish an institutional mechanism for responding to extraneous influence.\\n\\nThe proposed amendments also include provisions that were approved by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) in 1967 and 2003, and circulated for compliance at that time, but were not incorporated in the notified Code of Conduct. The substitution of an article relating to judges’ exposure to the media was also discussed in detail.\\n\\nUse of Generative AI\\n\\nThe LJCP secretary, on the ethical use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in the judiciary, informed the committee that the subcommittee of the National Judicial Automation Committee (NJAC) has finalised a Draft Ethical Guidelines for the use of Generative AI in the Judiciary after extensive consultations with national experts and all high courts.\\n\\nThe guidelines propose a high-level ethical and operational framework for the responsible integration of AI technologies within the judicial system, ensuring alignment with national digital policies and international best practices.\\n\\nEnforced disappearances\\n\\nAttorney General for Pakistan (AGP) Mansoor Usman Awan informed the forum that the issue of enforced disappearances has largely been addressed through the recent amendment to Section 11EEEE of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, which requires the production of a detained person before a magistrate within 24 hours.\\n\\nThe AGP further assured the committee that a comprehensive mechanism to redress complaints of non-compliance with this legal requirement is being considered by the government and will be presented to the committee in its next meeting.\\n\\nThe committee appreciated the assurance given by the AGP.\\n\\nThe meeting concluded with appreciation for the sustained efforts of all high courts, the Ministry of Law and Justice, and the Law and Justice Commission Secretariat for their valuable contributions toward strengthening the administration of justice, promoting institutional coherence, and enhancing public confidence in the judicial system.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 18th, 2025",
