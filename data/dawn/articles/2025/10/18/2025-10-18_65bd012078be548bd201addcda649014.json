  "content": "Leg-spinner Rishad Hossain produced a record-setting six-wicket show to help Bangladesh thrash West Indies by 74 runs in the first One-day International here at the Shere Bangla National Stadium on Saturday.\n\nAfter being sent in to bat first, Bangladesh posted a modest 207 all out and then dismissed the West Indies for a paltry 133 with the 23-year-old Rishad running through the West Indies batting with his first five-wicket haul in ODIs. The win gave the hosts a 1-0 lead in the three-match series.\n\nRishad, in the process, became the first Bangladesh leg-spinner to bag a five-for in an ODI. Moreover, his figures of 6-35 off eight overs became the best-ever in ODIs by any Bangladesh spinner, and the second-best ODI bowling figures ever recorded for the country.\n\nAhead of him are two pacers who both recorded figures of 6-26, Mashrafe Mortaza against Kenya in 2006 and Rubel Hossain against New Zealand in 2012.\n\nBrandon King posted the highest of 44 runs for West Indies, but his effort was not enough for his team because of Rishad’s exceptional bowling.\n\nBesides Rishad’s heroics, Mustafizur Rahman bagged two wickets for just 16 runs.\n\nEarlier, Bangladesh failed to post a good total that later proved enough.\n\nOpeners Saif Hassan and Soumya Sarkar were dismissed by the third over with just eight runs on the board.\n\nThe match also saw a pitch invader on the field, before the spectator was escorted off the field.\n\nHowever, Najmul Hossain and Towhid Hridoy then added 71 runs for the third wicket that rescued the hosts. Najmul fell for 32, but Hridoy went on to make 51 off 90 balls with the help of three fours.\n\nMahidul Islam, getting his first ODI cap, posted a 76-ball 46 laced with three fours.\n\nWest Indies pacer Jayden Seales bagged three wickets for 48 runs.\n\nThe second and third ODI of the series will take place on October 21 and 23 at the same venue.",
