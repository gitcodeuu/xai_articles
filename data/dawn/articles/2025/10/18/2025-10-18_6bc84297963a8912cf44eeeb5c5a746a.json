They also agreed that no madressah [seminary] will be closed down.\n\nMr Naqvi reiterated that those bearing arms against the government will face the law.\n\n“Holding arms against the state can never be allowed,” Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying, adding that the leaders also agre­­ed that “the miscreants will be dealt with strictly.”\n\nMr Naqvi emphasised that no one will be permitted to take the law into their own hands.\n\n“There is no place for miscreants and extremists in the Pakistan of Quaid-i-Azam,” Naqvi said, adding that elements spreading “unrest, chaos, and extremism will be dealt with with an iron hand.”\n\nThe minister acknowledged the valuable role religious scholars play in promoting interfaith harmony and patience.\n\nHe stressed that the promotion of religious education is a collective responsibility and called on all segments of society to ensure lasting peace, tolerance, and harmony.\n\nAllama Noorani, in turn, assured the government of his party’s “full cooperation” in promoting sustainable peace, tolerance, and brotherhood across the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 18th, 2025",
