  "content": "China and the United States agreed on Saturday to conduct another round of trade negotiations in the coming week, as the world’s two biggest economies seek to avoid another damaging tit-for-tat tariff battle.\n\nBeijing last week announced sweeping controls on the critical rare earths industry, prompting US President Donald Trump to threaten 100 percent tariffs on imports from China in retaliation.\n\nTrump had also threatened to cancel his expected meeting with Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping in South Korea later this month on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit.\n\nIn the latest indication of efforts to resolve their dispute, Chinese state media reported that Vice Premier He Lifeng and US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent had “candid, in-depth and constructive exchanges” during a Saturday morning call, and that both sides agreed to hold a new round of trade talks “as soon as possible”.\n\nOn social media, Bessent described the call as “frank and detailed”, and said they would meet “in-person next week to continue our discussions”.\n\nBessent had previously accused China of seeking to harm the rest of the world by tightening restrictions rare earths, which are critical to everything from smartphones to guided missiles.\n\nUS Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also participated in the call, according to the report by Chinese state news agency Xinhua.\n\nHours before the call, Fox News released excerpts of an interview with Trump in which he said he would meet Xi at the APEC summit after all.\n\nTrump told the outlet that the 100 per cent tariff on goods from China was not sustainable.\n\n“It’s not sustainable, but that’s what the number is… They forced me to do that,” he said.\n\nThe high-level video call came as Washington worked to rally Group of Seven finance ministers in response to the latest Chinese export controls.\n\nFor now, the G7 ministers have agreed to coordinate a short-term response and diversify suppliers, the EU’s economy commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis told reporters in Washington.\n\nSpeaking after the grouping met this week, Dombrovskis noted the vast majority of rare earth supplies come from China, meaning that diversification could take years.\n\n“We agreed, both bilaterally with the US and at the G7 level, to coordinate our approach,” he said on the sidelines of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank’s fall meetings.\n\nCountries would also exchange information on their contacts with Chinese counterparts as they work out short-term solutions, he added.\n\nGerman Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil told journalists he hopes that Trump and Xi’s meeting can help to resolve much of the US-China trade conflict.\n\n“We have made it clear within the G7 that we do not agree with China’s approach,” he added, referring to the group of Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States.\n\nIMF chief Kristalina Georgieva also expressed hope Friday for an agreement between the countries to cool tensions.\n\nThe US-China trade war reignited this year as Trump promised sweeping tariffs on imports soon after returning to office.\n\nAt one point, US-China tariffs escalated to triple-digit levels, effectively halting some trade as businesses waited for a resolution.\n\nThe two countries have since lowered their respective levies but their truce has remained shaky.",
