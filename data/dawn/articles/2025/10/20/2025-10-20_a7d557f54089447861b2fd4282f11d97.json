He recalled that over 14,000 Afghans had already left the UN-designated camp.\\n\\nHe said the operation also continued on Sunday, which was expected to be completed within some days. He said that on the very first day, the law enforcers had faced minor resistance from the alleged land mafia, but later on, the action was being conducted smoothly with no obstruction from any quarter.\\n\\nSSP Mastoi said the operation was started as per the policy of the federal government because certain elements were trying to illegally occupy land, which triggered fears of the breach of peace.\\n\\nThe land belongs to the Malir Development Authority.\\n\\nAccording to officials, around 15,680 Afghans were previously living in the camp. Out of them, 14,296 had returned to their home country, Afghanistan, while the remaining 1,384 are still living there and are being repatriated in phases.\\n\\nThe operation was launched in the light of a letter written by West-Zone DIG Irfan Ali Baloch to the Addl. IGP Karachi and other concerned authorities, drawing their attention towards the land mafia that attempted to illegally occupy the land.\\n\\nThe DIG had also called for setting up a special committee, comprising representatives of the city administration, police and other relevant institutions, to prevent illegal occupation of the vacated government land.\\n\\nThe Afghan Camp was stated to be the biggest facility for displaced persons where an estimated 30,000 people used to live in the past.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 20th, 2025",
