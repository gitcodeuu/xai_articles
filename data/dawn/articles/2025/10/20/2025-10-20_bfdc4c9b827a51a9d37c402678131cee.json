McLaren have already sealed the constructors’ title.\\n\\n“For sure, the chance is there,” Verstappen said of the title battle. “We just need to try and deliver these weekends until the end.\\n\\n“We will try whatever we can. It’s exciting,” he added after his third win in the last four races and 68th of his career.\\n\\nPiastri said he still had full confidence in his ability to become Australia’s first champion since Alan Jones in 1980, and no worries.\\n\\n“I’d still rather be where I am than the other two,” added the 24-year-old.\\n\\nNorris lost out to Leclerc at the start and then took 21 laps to find a way back past as the Monegasque, on the faster but less durable soft tyres, held a defensive masterclass.\\n\\nLeclerc then battled with Lewis Hamilton, who started on mediums, before pitting on lap 23 and coming back out in ninth place with his teammate moving up to third and Piastri to fourth.\\n\\nVerstappen by then was 10 seconds down the road from his closest rival.\\n\\nOnce the rest of the frontrunners had made their pitstops, Leclerc was again second on the road — but more than six seconds behind Verstappen — with Norris third and having to overtake all over again with a track limits warning hanging over him.\\n\\nJob done, Norris pulled away and finished 7.9 seconds behind Verstappen and 7.4 ahead of the Ferrari.\\n\\n“It was tough. We did everything we could,” he said of a battle that gave the fans some excitement as Verstappen completed lap after lap largely absent from the global television feed.\\n\\n“I expected a slightly easier second attempt to get through, but it wasnt the case. Charles drove a very good race. It was good fun, good battles. So we have to take second. Not a lot more we couldve done today.”\\n\\nMcLaren team boss Andrea Stella said, however, that Norris could have fought for the win had he not been held up by the Ferrari.\\n\\nHamilton was fourth, with Piastri just 1.1 seconds behind, and George Russell — winner last time out in Singapore — taking the chequered flag in sixth for Mercedes.\\n\\nRed Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda finished seventh, ahead of Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg and Haas’s Oliver Bearman. Fernando Alonso took the final point for Aston Martin.\\n\\nThe virtual safety car was deployed on lap seven when Mercedes’ Italian rookie Kimi Antonelli and Williams’ Carlos Sainz collided, with the Spaniard retiring after trying to overtake on the inside for seventh place.\\n\\nStewards handed Sainz a five-place grid penalty at next weekend’s Mexican Grand Prix, plus two penalty points, for causing the collision.\\n\\nSainz’s teammate Alex Albon had also been caught up in a first corner collision with Sauber’s Brazilian rookie Gabriel Bortoleto.\\n\\nThe weekend was declared a heat hazard, although the air temperature during the race was lower than feared at around 28.6 degrees Celsius.\\n\\nRed Bull were fined 50,000 euros ($58,300), with half suspended, for a grid breach before the start of the US Grand Prix.\\n\\nStewards said a Red Bull team member re-entered the gate well area near the grid position of McLaren’s Lando Norris after the formation lap had started and as marshals began to close the gate.\\n\\nThe reason for doing so was not disclosed in the statement.\\n\\nSources from more than one team told Reuters, however, that McLaren had placed a marker to help Norris line up his car correctly on the grid and the Red Bull employee had wanted to remove it.\\n\\nThere was no official comment from either team, with Red Bull principal Laurent Mekies speaking to reporters before the stewards’ decision and giving no details pending the outcome.",
