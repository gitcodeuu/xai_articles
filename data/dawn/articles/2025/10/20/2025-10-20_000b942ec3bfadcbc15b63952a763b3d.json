As a result, the statement said, the terrorists couldn’t come near the police station and fled.\n\nAccording to police, “residents from nearby areas also fired at the attackers” and helped law enforcers.\n\nThe statement did not mention any loss of lives or property in the incident, which was earlier confirmed by Bannu Regional Police Officer (RPO) Sajjad Khan. He told Dawn.com that the attackers had used a hand grenade to target the police station.\n\n“Unidentified attackers threw a hand grenade toward the police station, but it fell at a distance, causing no damage,” he said.\n\nThe RPO added that the attackers fled after the attempt and a search operation to hunt them was under way.\n\nPakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.\n\nOn Friday night, police intercepted an explosive-laden rickshaw in the Bannu district, killing three terrorists and foiling a potential suicide attack on a police post in Mazanga in the jurisdiction of the Havaid police station.\n\nOn Saturday, unkn­own assailants launched a rocket and gun attack on the Azam Warsak police station in South Waziristan’s\n\nAccording to police, the attackers targeted the police station from multiple directions, but the police and the FC personnel responded swiftly, forcing the assailants to flee. No casualties were reported in the incident.",
