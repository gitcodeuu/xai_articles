  "content": "Amazon’s cloud services unit AWS was struggling to recover on Monday from a widespread outage that knocked out thousands of websites along with some of the world’s most popular apps — Snapchat and Reddit — and disrupted businesses globally.\\n\\nThe turmoil marked the largest internet disruption since last year’s CrowdStrike malfunction hobbled technology systems in hospitals, banks and airports, and highlights the vulnerability of the world’s interconnected technologies.\\n\\nAfter more than nine hours of disruptions, some applications were gradually coming back online as of 1pm ET (10pm PKT). But AWS acknowledged that elevated errors were still affecting several AWS services and that it was working on recovering connectivity.\\n\\nAWS was down for more than 9,300 users as of 1pm ET, according to outage tracking website Downdetector. That figure is higher than the earlier peak of about 5,800 reports at 3:48am ET (12:48pm PKT).\\n\\nLambda, one of AWS’s computing services, was experiencing errors due to issues with an internal subsystem, AWS said in the latest update on its status page. “We are taking steps to recover this internal Lambda system,” it said.\\n\\nAWS said earlier the root cause of the outage is an underlying subsystem that monitors the health of its network load balancers used to distribute traffic across several servers to ensure improved performance and capacity.\\n\\nThe issue, AWS said, originated from within the “EC2 internal network.”\\n\\nEC2 refers to Amazon’s “Elastic Compute Cloud” service, which provides on-demand cloud capacity within AWS. Businesses use EC2 to run virtual servers that they need to develop, launch and host applications, and can scale up or down on capacity as required.\\n\\nWhile some apps like Reddit and Roblox had largely stabilised, according to outage tracking website Downdetector, others, including Snapchat, PayPal’s Venmo and Duolingo, were showing a resurgence in issues seen earlier in the day.\\n\\nAWS provides computing power, data storage and other digital services to companies, governments and individuals and is the world’s largest cloud provider, followed by Microsoft’s Azure and Alphabet’s Google Cloud.\\n\\nDisruptions to its servers can cause outages across websites and platforms — ranging from food delivery apps to gaming platforms and airline systems — that rely on its cloud infrastructure.\\n\\nAWS said on its status page that Monday’s outage originated at its US-EAST-1 location in northern Virginia, its oldest and largest for web services. The site suffered outages in 2021 and 2020.\\n\\nAccording to documentation on the AWS website, the US-EAST-1 site is often the default region for many AWS services.\\n\\nAsked for comment, AWS directed Reuters to its status page. Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe problem highlights how interconnected everyday digital services have become and their reliance on a small number of global cloud providers, with one glitch wreaking havoc on business and day-to-day life, experts and academics said.\\n\\n“This outage once again highlights the dependency we have on relatively fragile infrastructures,” said Jake Moore, Global Cybersecurity Advisor at European cybersecurity firm ESET.\\n\\nIn Britain, Lloyd Bank, Bank of Scotland and telecom service providers Vodafone and BT were all hit, according to Downdetector’s UK website, as was UK tax, payments and customs authority HMRC’s website.\\n\\n“The main reason for this issue is that all these big companies have relied on just one service,” said Nishanth Sastry, director of research at the University of Surrey’s Department of Computer Science.\\n\\nOokla, which owns Downdetector, said over 4 million users reported issues due to the incident.\\n\\n“For major businesses, hours of cloud downtime translate to millions in lost productivity and revenue,” said Ryan Griffin, US cyber practice leader at insurance broker McGill and Partners.\\n\\nOokla said at least a thousand companies were affected by the outage.\\n\\nSnapchat last had over 7,500 reports on Downdetector, lower than the peak of more than 22,000 but still higher than the 4,000 outage instances seen at around 7am ET (4pm PKT).\\n\\nArtificial intelligence startup Perplexity, cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase and trading app Robinhood all experienced platform disruptions and attributed them to AWS.\\n\\nAmazon’s own services, including its shopping website, Prime Video and Alexa, were also hit, although Downdetector last showed a decrease in severity.\\n\\nFortnite, owned by Epic Games; Clash Royale and Clash of Clans were among the gaming platforms affected. Uber rival Lyft was also knocked down in the United States.\\n\\nIn a post on X, Signal President Meredith Whittaker confirmed the messaging app was hit by the outage as well, though billionaire Elon Musk, who owns X, said his platform continued to work.\\n\\nWhile there has been no indication of a potential cyberattack behind Monday’s outage, the scale of the disruption has fed speculation.\\n\\n“When anything like this happens, the concern that it’s a cyber incident is understandable,” said Rafe Pilling, director of threat intelligence at cybersecurity firm Sophos.\\n\\n“AWS has a far-reaching and intricate footprint, so any issue can cause a major upset.”",
