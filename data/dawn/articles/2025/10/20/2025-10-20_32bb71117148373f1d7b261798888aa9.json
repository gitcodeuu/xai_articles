  "content": "Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi on Monday claimed that the resurgence of terrorism being witnessed in the province was due to the “flawed policy” of the federal government.\n\nThe PTI, which has been in power in KP since 2013, opposes military operations, which are also resisted by tribal people as they often lead to displacements.\n\nAlthough the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan. A military operation looms over the Kurram district, where people have started leaving their homes, while a targeted action is planned in Bajaur’s War Mamund tehsil.\n\nIn his first official high-level meeting since he assumed the role of the KP CM on October 15, Afridi presented “important policy directives and announcements”, a post on his office’s X account said.\n\n“Terrorism has returned to the province due to the federal government’s wrong policy,” the post quoted CM Afridi as saying.\n\nHe further claimed that the federal government was neither giving KP funds allocated under the country’s ongoing war against terrorism, nor “other Constitutional rights”.\n\n“The Centre should realise our sacrifices and release our funds on time. We can only strengthen our police and combat terrorism once we get our funds,” the chief minister said, lauding the KP police’s “unparalleled sacrifices” to eradicate terrorism.\n\n“The bulletproof cars provided by the interior minister (Mohsin Naqvi) are defective and old. This is a mockery of KP Police. These vehicles should be recalled,” Afridi said.\n\nAffirming that law and order were the provincial government’s top priority, he vowed there would be no compromise on it.\n\n“The police would not face a shortage of funds. All required resources will be provided on a priority basis. The police will be equipped with modern equipment and arms.”\n\nResponding to the KP chief minister later in the day, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry alleged that funds provided by the federal government were not appropriately used by the provincial government in the fight against terrorism.\n\nHe asserted that the vehicles dismissed as being inferior by the chief minister were of international standards and the same as those used by federal ministers, institutional officers and anti-terror operations.\n\n“Losses are close to zero wherever these vehicles are used.”\n\nThe state minister alleged that the provincial police was being thrown before terrorists with the move and nothing was being made available to it. He said the move reflected CM Afridi’s “immature thinking”, proved his detractors right and increased the threat to law enforcement agencies.\n\n“This is a highly unfortunate decision.”\n\nCM Afridi also vowed that “no political individual” will be detained in KP under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, which gives authorities the power to arrest and detain suspected individuals to prevent “any person from acting in any manner prejudicial to public safety” or to maintain public order.\n\nIn a petition to the Supreme Court last year, PTI founder Imran Khan sought a bar on “indiscriminate and unlawful use of detention orders” under the MPO against political workers, rights activists and political opponents.\n\n“Freedom of expression and constructive criticism is a fundamental Constitutional right of everyone,” Afridi was quoted as saying in the post.\n\nHe further said that no one will be arrested under a “political” first information report (FIR).\n\n“These FIRs were registered due to political vendetta. The province has its own specific political culture; we will not let it be ruined. The [KP] police will never subject anyone to political vendettas. No FIR should be registered against any student,” said Afridi, who has remained the provincial president of the PTI’s student wing, the Insaf Students Federation (ISF).\n\n“The situation of KP Police should under no circumstances be like that of Punjab Police,” the chief minister quipped, ordering strictly that there should be no torture of prisoners.\n\nWhile vowing there would be no political interference in the police, the KP CM also warned that there should be no public complaints against it. He further said there should be separate enclaves for the police and the media in the provincial government’s housing schemes.\n\nWhile alleging that there was an attempt to “steal the public mandate” during the 2024 general elections in KP, Afridi hailed the provincial bureaucracy and police for “protecting the mandate of the province’s people”.\n\n“However, unfortunately, some government officials could not bear the pressure and did not protect the public mandate,” the PTI leader said.\n\nHe vowed to reward those who stood with the people during last year’s elections and to take “strict action” against those who did not do so, directing the chief secretary to identify such people.\n\nCM Afridi further asserted, “Zero-tolerance policy against corruption is our party’s most important agenda. […] Strict action will be taken against whoever engages in corruption.”\n\nThe chief minister also warned that if the public was not satisfied with any government official’s performance, that official would be removed from their role.\n\n“I have not come to work in the traditional way. We will have to work outside the traditional manner,” Afridi was quoted as saying.\n\nHe also announced the establishment of Tribal Medical College and Tribal University of Modern Sciences for the merged districts, adding that playgrounds will be built on the tehsil level in all merged districts (erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas). A Safe City project aimed at reducing crime was also announced for these areas.\n\nThe PTI leader said a “University of Investigation and Modern Journalism” dedicated to slain journalist Arshad Sharif will be built, while announcing another Revival Plan for Peshawar’s development.\n\nThe chief minister also pledged to end the “reference culture” for postings and transfers of government employees and to ensure implementation of the two-year policy for these.",
