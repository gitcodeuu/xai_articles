Both leaders agreed to continue political consultations on matters of national importance,” a statement from the PPP said.\n\nAccording to the ISPR, 23 Pakistani troops were martyred and 29 injured in the weekend skirmishes which began with the Afghan Taliban attacking posts across the border.\n\nThe military’s media affairs wing also said that credible intelligence estimates and damage assessment showed that “more than 200 Taliban and affiliated terrorists have been neutralised, while the number of injured is much higher”.\n\nAfghanistan claimed it carried out the attack as a “retaliatory” measure, accusing Islamabad of conducting air strikes in its territory last week. For its part, Islamabad did not confirm whether it was behind the air strikes but underscored Pakistan’s right and resolve to defend itself.\n\nThe weekend clash took place against the backdrop of Pakistan suffering multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations against terrorists.\n\nIslamabad has repeatedly called on Kabul to bar terrorist groups from using its territory to attack Pakistan; however, Afghanistan denies the allegations and claims Afghan soil is not used for attacks on neighbouring countries.\n\nThe issue of terrorists using Afghan soil against Pakistan has long strained ties between the two countries and the ties seem to have nose-dived with the recent increase in hostilities at the border.",
