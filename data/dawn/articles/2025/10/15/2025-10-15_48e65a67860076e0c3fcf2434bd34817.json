  "content": "The Peshawar High Court (PHC) on Wednesday dismissed a petition seeking the annulment of Sohail Afridi’s election as the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, who is set to be administered his oath by the provincial governor, Faisal Karim Kundi, later today.\n\nThe petition, on which the court had reserved its verdict earlier today, was filed by JUI-F leader Maulana Lutfur Rehman yesterday. Rehman, who was among the four contenders for the KP CM post, had requested the court to “set aside” Afridi’s election and declare it null and void.\n\nAt today’s hearing, which was presided over by Justice Arshad Ali and Justice Waqar Ahmad, Barrister Yaseen appeared on behalf of Rehman against PTI’s Salman Akram Raja.\n\nAddressing the court, Raja pointed out that the JUI-F petition at hand “has become ineffective in light of yesterday’s PHC order.”\n\nResponding to his comments, Justice Ali said, “Yes, we are aware of the order, but let’s hear the petitioner’s argument.”\n\nBarrister Yaseen told the court, “How was a new chief minister elected if the resignation of the former CM had not yet been accepted and the seat remained occupied?”\n\nCiting Article 105 of the Constitution, the petitioner’s counsel pointed out that only the Governor has the right to advise the CM,“ adding that “Gandapur’s resignation was sent by post; he did not submit it himself.”\n\nTo this, Justice Ali responded, saying, “I understand your point — the post will remain vacant until the resignation is accepted.”\n\nThe petitioner’s lawyer further argued that the “election was unconstitutional and should not have taken place.” He cautioned that “electing a new chief minister while there already was a chief minister in place could create a constitutional upheaval.”\n\n“If the resignation had been accepted, then it would have made sense to hold the election and all respective parties would have taken part in it,” he added.\n\n“The cabinet has not yet been dissolved; it is still in place,” he noted, to which Justice Ali said: “ When the chief minister (Gandapur) is not in his position any more, how are we talking about the cabinet?“\n\n“Yes, that is exactly what I am saying — Ali Amin Gandapur is still the chief minister,” Yaseen said, in response to the judge’s comments.\n\nJustice Ali, addressing the petitioner’s lawyer, said, “Have you read yesterday’s order from the chief justice”?\n\n“Yes, I have read it,” he said, alleging that PTI had filed an incorrect application.\n\nJustice Ali offered the petitioner’s legal counsel two options: “to either withdraw the petition or let the case be heard on merit.”\n\n“Decide on the merit,” barrister Yaseen said.\n\nSubsequently, the court reserved its decision in the matter and later dismissed the petition.\n\nYesterday, JUI-F’s Rehman filed a petition in the PHC, requesting that the election of Afridi as the KP chief minister be “set aside” and declared null and void.\n\nRehman was one of the four people in the race for the KP CM office, along with Sardar Shah Jehan Yousaf of the PML-N, Arbab Zarak Khan of the PPP and PTI’s Afridi.\n\nIn the petition, Rehman named six respondents, including the KP government, Governor Kundi, the KP Assembly through Speaker Swati, the secretary of the provincial assembly, Gandapur and Afridi.\n\nHe requested the court to set aside the election and declare it “ab initio void” as it was “wholly unlawful, arbitrary, capricious, mala fide, without jurisdiction, coram non judice.”\n\nRehman asked the court to halt any further proceedings in the matter until the governor had “lawfully received and verified” the resignation of Gandapur.\n\nThe petition called for a fresh election “in accordance with the Constitution and the assembly rules, after lawful confirmation of vacancy.”\n\nAfridi’s election on Monday was held amid uncertainty about the status of Ali Amin Gandapur’s resignation from the provincial chief executive’s position, prompting the opposition to boycott the election.\n\nOn Monday, before the election, two resignations submitted to KP Governor Kundi by Gandapur — who stepped down on party founder Imran Khan’s directive — were returned over “disparate signatures”, and Kundi summoned him on October 15 (today) to settle the matter.\n\nBy that time, KP Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati had already convened an assembly session to elect a new leader of the house. And the PTI maintained that under Article 130(8) of the Constitution, a chief minister’s resignation did not require the governor’s acceptance or approval.\n\nThe opposition, however, disagreed and walked out of the session held for the CM election. Following its boycott, candidates fielded by the JUI-F, the PPP and the PML-N received zero votes while Afridi won the race with 90.\n\nAt yesterday’s hearing at the PHC, Chief Justice (CJ) S.M. Attique Shah issued the directive to the Governor to administer the oath to CM-elect Afridi, instructing that the KP Assembly speaker should administer the oath if the governor did not.\n\nThe court’s decision came on a PTI application seeking the nomination of the assembly speaker or any other person “considered appropriate” in place of the governor to administer the oath to Afridi.\n\nFollowing the court’s decision, Kundi said while speaking to the media in Karachi that he had been saying he would abide by the Constitution. “I never said that I would not administer the oath,” he added.",
