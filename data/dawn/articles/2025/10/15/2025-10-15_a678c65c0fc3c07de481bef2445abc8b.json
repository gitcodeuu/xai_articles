This step aligns with broader government-level discussions and aims to integrate international best practices into Pakistan’s offshore operations. In parallel, PPL worked with Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) and Mari Energies Ltd (MEL).\n\nMeanwhile, MEL has also made significant strides in diversifying its operations, particularly in the mining sector. The company is actively engaging with global mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP to explore and monetise Pakistan’s mineral resources.
