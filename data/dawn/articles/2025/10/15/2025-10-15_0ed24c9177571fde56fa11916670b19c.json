Malik in­­terjected and recalled previous ju­­d­gements, which held that when a par­­ticular constitutional provision was under challenge, it could be disregarded until its legality was determined, Justice Mandokhail retor­t­­ed, “Let the counsel respond to the query.”\n\nCiting the Practice and Procedure judgment, Mr Zuberi explained that the current constitutional bench comprised eight judges, while its total sanctioned strength was 15. Consequently, the right of intra-court appeal against a decision of the current bench might not be available, since at least nine different judges would be required to hear such an appeal.\n\nJustice Malik observed that the Practice and Procedure ruling had provided a mechanism — empowering the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) to decide whether to grant or deny the right of appeal. “If the Commission wishes to allow it, it can nominate additional judges to enhance the bench’s strength. And if it does not agree, the right can be withheld,” she explained.\n\nJustice Mandokhail, however, disagreed, asserting that even if a full court of 16 judges were constituted, the right of appeal would still not apply to its decisions.\n\nMr Zuberi said that it had been held in the Practice and Procedure case that when the entire court sits en banc, no appeal was necessary as the collective wisdom of all judges was already represented.\n\nAdoption of SC rules\n\nJustice Mandokhail said both Ar­­ticle 191A of the Constitution and the Supreme Court Rules 2025 were silent on the precise composition of a full court. He noted that when the full court, on the administrative side, approved the new rules, the requirement of collective decision-making had already been fulfilled.\n\nThe observation, however, stirred controversy.\n\nJustice Malik said no discussion had taken place when the rules were approved, rather they were adopted through circulation, and her dissenting note was on the record. She suggested that the minutes of the process be called to verify how the rules had been passed.\n\nHowever, Justice Mandokhail insisted that bench formation would proceed strictly in accordance with the new rules.\n\nMr Zuberi referred to Order 11 of the SC Rules, arguing that the three-judge committee under the Practice and Procedure Act was responsible for constituting benches. Justice Mandokhail, however, pointed out that nowhere in the rules was it stated that benches would be formed by the Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP), adding that the rules were finalised in the presence of all 24 judges.\n\nJustice Muhammad Ali Mazhar agreed with Justice Malik’s observation that the rules had been app­r­oved through circulation. Justice Ma­­­ndokhail maintained that all judges had been asked to give their input. “Are you calling for the reco­rds or not?” Justice Malik asked, turning towards the head of the bench.\n\nSensing the growing tension, Justice Mussarat Hilali advised her colleagues to lower their voices and move forward calmly.\n\n“This case will not proceed further until it becomes clear how the rules were adopted,” Justice Mando­khail remarked sharply. “If I am being contradicted, I will place everything before the entire nation.”\n\nJustice Hilali replied humorously that the “entire nation” was not watching since the live-streaming of the hearing was unavailable. Justice Mazhar then instructed court staff to fix the technical fault immediately.\n\nThe tense exchanges prompted the attorney general to return to the rostrum, urging the judges to refrain from debating internal court matters in open proceedings. Later, the court staff informed the bench that live-streaming had been restored.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 15th, 2025",
