  "content": "An eight-judge Constitutional Bench (CB) of the Supreme Court (SC) on Wednesday began its deliberations on the petitioners’ request to form a full court to hear a set of pleas challenging the 26th Amendment.\n\nThe Amendment, which was approved by both houses of parliament in October last year, altered judicial authority and tenure, and has been a lightning rod for debate with both opposition parties and legal experts questioning its impact on the judiciary’s autonomy.\n\nIt took away the SC’s suo motu powers, set the chief justice of Pakistan’s (CJP) term at three years and empowered a Special Parliamentary Committee for the appointment of the CJP from among the three most senior SC judges. It also paved the way for the formation of the CB, which is now hearing petitions against the very legislation that enabled its establishment.\n\nThe legislation had been challenged by various bar associations, bar councils, lawyers, the PTI, and some politicians. The SC is also seized with separate petitions seeking the formation of a full court to hear the matter, rather than the CB.\n\nThe CB is headed by Justice Aminuddin Khan and also includes Justices Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Muhammad Ali Mazhar, Ayesha Malik, Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Musarrat Hilali, Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Shahid Bilal Hassan. It resumed proceedings yesterday after over eight months, and unanimously allowed live-streaming of the case upon some petitioners’ request.\n\nThe pleas taken up also seek the formation of a full court to hear the matter. Hence, before proceeding further, the court will first determine whether the challenges should be heard by a full court comprising all available SC judges or by the same eight-judge CB.\n\nDuring today’s hearing, Lahore High Court Bar Association (LHCBA) lawyer Hamid Khan requested the formation of a 16-member bench to hear the pleas, as per the number of SC judges at the time of the 26th Amendment.\n\nSeveral judges, including Justice Aminuddin, observed that the 26th Amendment was currently part of the Constitution. Some judges questioned whether the CB had the power to form a full court, while Justice Malik noted there was no restriction on issuing a judicial order for that.\n\nThe hearing was then adjourned till 11:30am tomorrow.\n\nRequests to form a full court bench and to live stream the case dominated yesterday’s hearing, with the state lawyer expressing no objection to live stream the proceedings.\n\nCommenting on today’s hearing, Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) Vice Chairman Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar, who is one of the petitioners, said: “Justice Ayesha stood out with her observations, while her colleagues appeared to take refuge in Article 5’s ‘loyalty to the state’ clause”.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, Advocate Hamid came to the rostrum and said the 26th Amendment was introduced in an “unusual” manner and passed by the parliament at night.\n\nHamid recalled that there were 17 judges present in the SC at the time the legislation was passed, including then-CJP Qazi Faez Isa, who later retired. Therefore, he contended, a 16-judge “full court” bench as of then should hear the pleas and pointed out that all eight judges in the current CB would be part of that bench as they were already serving as SC judges in October last year.\n\nAs per the SC’s website, there are currently a total of 24 judges in the SC, including CJP Yahya Afridi, after six new judges were appointed in February.\n\n“This Amendment is against the very basic features of the Constitution,” he asserted, at which Justice Mandokhail said that the matter will be deliberated upon later and asked him whether the Amendment was currently a part of the Constitution.\n\nIn response to Hamid’s arguments, Justice Aminuddin remarked, “We depend on the Constitution. Lawyers also depend on the Constitution. Unless the Constitution is [further] amended, we will have to depend on the current Constitution.”\n\nJustice Hilali also observed that whether the 26th Amendment was “right or wrong”, the court had not suspended it yet. “You consider the 26th Amendment a part of the Constitution, which is why you have challenged it.”\n\nHere, Justice Mazhar noted that the CB was at the moment not considering the main question of the legislation’s legality, but the request for a full court and sought arguments on that.\n\nHamid responded that he was not detailing how the 26th Amendment was unconstitutional, but on the “effects of its powers”. He said it was for the first time after the legislation that the “authority to form benches was taken away from the chief justice”.\n\nNoting that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) existed prior to last year’s constitutional tweaks, the LHCBA counsel said the 26th Amendment impacted the JCP’s formation as “judges became a minority” after the number of its members was increased.\n\n“After the Amendment, the majority in the Judicial Commission went to the administrative side, which affected judicial independence,” Hamid said.\n\nUpon Justice Mandokhail asking Hamid whether he was acknowledging the 26th Amendment or not, the lawyer replied in the negative.\n\nAt this point during the hearing, Justice Mazhar wondered whether a bench constituted after the 26th Amendment could decide a plea seeking the formation of a full court.\n\nJustice Mandokhail, however, remarked that the Amendment was part of the Constitution for now. At Justice Afghan pointing out that Hamid had not specified in his petition that “to whom should the bench send the case”, the lawyer said the matter should be referred to the CJP.\n\nJustice Hilali also asked whether the LHCBA counsel had made any request to the authority responsible for constituting the benches. To this, Hamid replied, “We are challenging the bench formation, which was constituted under the influence of the 26th Amendment.”\n\nHere, Justice Aminuddin observed, “Right now, [we are] not at such a stage to consider who will hear the case. Possibly, there might be hearings for a month on the matter of who will hear the case,” he added.\n\n“On what basis are you saying that we cannot hear the case?” the CB head questioned Hamid, remarking that it was not in the judges’ control to “go back to before the 26th Amendment”.\n\nAt this point during the hearing, Justice Malik said, “Whether a full court hears or a bench, no one is stopping any judicial order. The process continues after a judicial order.\n\n“Where under the 26th Amendment is a full court being barred?” she asked, to which Hamid replied that the legislation did not do so.\n\nJustice Malik observed, “When there is a request for forming a bench, we do not question the procedure. We give directions, after which the process is initiated.”\n\nHere, Justice Aminuddin wondered under what authority the CB would constitute a full court, following which Justice Malik said there was “no restriction on forming a full court under a judicial order”.\n\n“Where in the 26th Amendment is it written that a judicial order cannot be issued? Such is being done in ordinary cases, then why not in this case?” she countered.\n\nJustice Afghan again raised the issue of Hamid not mentioning the said request in his petition.\n\nUpon Justice Mazhar asking whether the CB could use Article 187 (issue and execution of SC processes) of the Constitution to issue the order for a full court, Hamid replied in the affirmative.\n\nAt one point during the hearing, Justice Mandokhail remarked that the CB was not conceptualised by the SC but by the parliament. When Hamid said the bench should “forget” Article 191A, under which the constitutional benches were formed in the apex court, Justice Aminuddin said if that was forgotten, the SC would not exist anymore.\n\n“A full court was always formed whenever questions were raised about the Constitution,” Hamid emphasised.\n\nAt this, Justice Mandokhail wondered if a “point decided by 17 judges in the past” can be reversed, to which the lawyer replied in the negative. “Will you not be glad if the previous decision is upheld and now a smaller bench hears the case?” the judge asked.\n\nHowever, Justice Afghan noted that the Supreme Court (Practice and Procedure) Act 2024 did not exist in the past. He remarked that CJPs in the past “kept using their powers to constitute full courts”, but now that authority lied with the SC Practice and Procedure Committee “as per the Constitution and the law”.\n\nThe petitioners have requested the apex court to strike down the entire 26th Amendment on grounds of procedural impropriety if determined that the requisite two-thirds of the lawfully elected membership of each House did not freely exercise their right to vote in favour of the same as required under Article 239, which elaborates on bills and their passage to amend the Constitution.\n\nIn the alternative, the petitioners pleaded, the court should strike down certain provisions of the 26th Amendment since they substantively undermine the independence of the judiciary, which is a salient feature of the Constitution.\n\nThese included the provisions for annual performance evaluations of high court judges by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan being inserted in Article 175A(1) and Articles 175A(18) to (20); the provisions relating to the appointment of the CJP being the substitution to Article 175A(3), and the provisions for constitutional benches in the SC and high courts.\n\nAs a consequence, the court should declare that the original Article 175A(3) holds the field and direct the federal government to notify SC’s senior-most judge as CJP in accordance with the original Article 175A(3), the petitioners argued.\n\nThe petitioners also challenged the constitutionality of the constitutional benches, arguing that the SC should declare invalid all amendments for which votes of such members whose election disputes were pending were necessary to achieve the prescribed numerical threshold in Article 239.\n\nThey also called for the Practice and Procedure Act 2024 and the Supreme Court (Number of Judges) Act 2024 to be declared unconstitutional, void ab initio and of no legal effect, since they stem from an “unconstitutional” amendment and represent an attempt to achieve unconstitutional designs.",
