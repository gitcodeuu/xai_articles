They also agreed to reconvene, at a mutually convenient time, the Joint Commission Meeting at the level of foreign ministers.\n\nBoth leaders reaffirmed their commitment to a peaceful and stable Afgha­nistan and a sustainable future for its people. They emphasised the importance of continued engagement with the interim Afghan authorities, particularly in combating terrorism and preventing the use of Afghan soil against other countries. They also stressed the importance of maintaining humanitarian assistance and capacity building for the Afghan population.\n\nThey condemned all forms of Islamophobia, xenophobia and incitement to violence, and reaffirmed their call on the international community to take concerted action to combat intolerance, negative stereotyping, stigmatisation, discrimination and violence against persons based on religion or belief.\n\nSustainable economic ties\n\nThe two leaders reaffirmed their commitment to promoting balanced and sustainable economic ties through enhanced market access, business facilitation and the effective utilisation of the Malaysia-Pakistan Closer Economic Partnership Agreement.\n\nMalaysia expressed its intention to expand palm oil exports to Pakistan and agreed to ensure a stable and sustainable supply chain while upholding environmentally responsible practices.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",
