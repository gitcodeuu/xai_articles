  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Every year, millions of gallons of water are released from Simly and Rawal dams through spillways to discharge excess water, as no mechanism exists to store the surplus for water-scarcity-hit Islamabad.\n\nThe latest spell of heavy rain on Monday filled both reservoirs to capacity, resulting in the opening of a gate of Simly Dam on Monday night, followed by the opening of the spillways of Rawal Dam on Tuesday.\n\nBefore the opening of spillways, Simly Dam had a water level of 2,315 feet, which was reduced by two feet after one gate was opened.\n\nThe spillways of Rawal Dam were opened when the water level reached up to 1,752 feet.\n\nSpillways of Simly, Rawal dams opened again after heavy rains as twin cities grapple with shortage issues\n\nRawal Dam, which is located in Islamabad, is managed by the Punjab government as it supplies water to the residents of Rawalpindi, while Simly Dam serves as the main water source for Islamabad.\n\n“Every year, a large amount of water is wasted from these two dams after the opening of spillways, which could have been stored for residents of water-scarcity-hit Islamabad. But the CDA never took practical steps in this regard,” said an official source.\n\nHe added that this year, the spillways of Rawal Dam were opened around 15 times, while Simly Dam’s spillways were opened about eight times. Sources said that around 12,000 million gallons per day (mgd) were spilled from Rawal and over 2,000 mgd from Simly Dam.\n\nThe spilled water flowed through the Sohan River and eventually into the Indus River.\n\nBesides the shortage of water supply, Islamabad is also facing depletion of its groundwater level.\n\nNo new water source has been developed for the capital in the past 25 years, despite the city’s growing population.\n\nThe CDA currently provides 70 million gallons per day to Islamabad residents against the actual need of over 280 mgd, drawn from three main sources, including Simly Dam, Khanpur Dam and tubewells.\n\nThe rural population relies either on bore water or small water schemes managed by the district government.\n\nAccording to documents available with Dawn, Islamabad’s total water demand is 283 mgd (246 mgd actual and 37 mgd in distribution losses), creating a supply gap of over 175 mgd.\n\nIn the past, several announcements were made to construct two small dams, Chinot Dam in the catchment area of Simly to prevent water loss through spillways, and Shahdara Dam.\n\nHowever, these projects have yet to move beyond paperwork.\n\nAlmost every government has announced plans to resolve Islamabad and Rawalpindi’s water issue.\n\nThe incumbent government also took notice a few months ago when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formed a task force headed by Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to address the problem.\n\nThe federal government also plans to establish a new independent body to oversee water projects, focusing on the Ghazi Barotha project, which aims to bring 100 million gallons per day each for Rawalpindi and Islamabad.\n\nWhen contacted, CDA spokesperson Shahid Kiani said the civic agency has been taking steps to address the water issue.\n\nHe said two small dams, including Chinot (upstream of Simly) and Shahdara (upstream of Rawal), will be built.\n\n“Once constructed, these small dams will not only function as water reservoirs but also help control silting,” he said, adding that to improve the groundwater table, “we are constructing 100 recharging wells, besides 20 water tanks”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",
