Israel, for its part wants Hamas to disarm, something the group rejects.\n\nHamas wants a permanent, comprehensive ceasefire, a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and the immediate start of a comprehensive reconstruction process under the supervision of a Palestinian “national technocratic body”, he said.\n\nPalestinian factions vowed to maintain armed resistance, while Netanyahu stayed silent on the talks. The US is seeking a ceasefire and prisoner deal, but Qatar says key gaps persist as Israel’s Gaza offensive and global protests continue.\n\nIn a related development, Egypt’s Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty said that a US delegation led by presidential envoy Steve Witkoff would join talks aimed at a truce in Gaza and prisoner exchange on Wednesday\n\nIn a joint press conference with his German counterpart, Abdelatty said he and Johann Wadephul “had a long conversation with Steve Witkoff, who is expected in Egypt in the coming hours”.\n\nGaza strikes\n\nIn the latest spate of violence, residents of Khan Younis in southern Gaza and Gaza City in the north reported new attacks by Israeli tanks, planes and boats in the early hours on Tuesday.\n\nIsrael and Hamas have endorsed the overall principles behind Trump’s plan, under which fighting would cease, prisoners go free and aid pour into Gaza. It also has backing from Arab and Western states.\n\nMeanwhile, Qatar’s foreign ministry spokesman said that Israel should have ceased operations in Gaza already in line with US President Trump’s peace plan.\n\n“Regarding the ceasefire, this question should be directed first to the Israeli occupation government. It was supposed to actually cease fire if the statements made by the prime minister there regarding adherence to the Trump plan were true,” Majed al-Ansari told reporters in Doha.\n\nAfter Hamas agreed on Friday to discuss freeing prisoners under Trump’s plan, the US president had called on Israel to cease fire in Gaza, posting on his Truth Social platform: “Israel must immediately stop the bombing of Gaza, so that we can get the prisoners out safely and quickly!”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",
