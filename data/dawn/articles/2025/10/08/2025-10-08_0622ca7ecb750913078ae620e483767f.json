The partnership eclipsed Australia’s previous best for the ninth wicket — 77 between Garth and Ashleigh Gardner — and also set a new Women’s World Cup benchmark, surpassing South Africa’s 66-run effort by Yulandi van der Merwe and Kim Price back in 2000.\n\nMooney’s innings was a masterclass in temperament, a classic backs-to-the-wall knock. She farmed the strike smartly, ran fast between the wickets and only unfurled the big shots towards the end.\n\n“It was a pretty tricky situation. We wanted to get a partnership going and really had to grind to reach 221,” said Mooney.\n\n“Alana King was incredible tonight. We’ve seen her do it before and it was nice to share that stand with her.”\n\nHaving rebuilt brick by brick, Mooney brought up her century with a nudge to mid-on off Fatima Sana, while King capped her maiden fifty in style, hoisting the Pakistan captain for six as Australia plundered 21 runs off the final over.\n\nMooney’s 109 off 114 deliveries, laced with 11 boundaries, ended when she holed out to cover off the final ball of the innings.\n\nKing remained unbeaten on 51 off 49, peppered with three fours and as many sixes, the highest score ever made by a number 10 or lower in women’s ODIs.\n\nPakistan never found their footing in reply, undone by Australia’s relentless discipline with the ball.\n\nThe seven-time world champions climbed back to the top of the points table, while Pakistan’s third straight defeat leaves their knockout hopes hanging by a thread.",
