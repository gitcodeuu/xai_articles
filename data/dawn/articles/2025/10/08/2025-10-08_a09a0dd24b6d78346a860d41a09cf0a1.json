The campaign also aims to identify how many meters are owned by each consumer.\n\nThe move had given the impression that the data would be shared with the FBR.\n\nAccording to an Iesco spokesperson, Mr Zafar Iqbal met Iesco Chief Executive Officer Engineer Chaudhry Khalid Mahmood and the company’s finance directorate head.\n\n“Iesco’s role is vital in achieving tax targets. Its timely collection of electricity bills and recovery from private and government customers is remarkable. In future, Iesco management will continue this outstanding performance, which contributes to Pakistan’s prosperity,” the spokesperson quoted him as saying.\n\nIesco CEO Engineer Khalid Mahmood said the company always prioritised the country’s interests, adding that timely bill collection was among the key performance indicators of the organisation, and recovery teams had consistently delivered good results.\n\n“The FBR team presented a certificate of performance to Khalid Mahmood on behalf of the FBR chairman,” the spokesperson added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",
