We have learnt that true strength lies not in avoiding adversity but in overcoming it with faith, unity, and innovation. As we look ahead, let us forge a nation where no disaster can break our resolve,” he added.\n\nWarning that this year’s monsoon floods had again displaced large populations and caused heavy losses in agriculture, infrastructure and livelihoods, President Zardari noted Pakistan’s negligible contribution to global emissions yet disproportionate exposure to climate impacts.\n\nOver the years, he said Pakistan’s disaster management framework has made important strides, transitioning to become a template of excellence.\n\nSafer, resilient Pakistan\n\nSeparately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called for national unity, proactive preparedness and climate resilience as the country marks the 20th anniversary of the devastating 2005 earthquake on National Resilience Day.\n\nIn a message to mark the day, the premier paid tribute to the courage with which the nation responded to the catastrophe.\n\n“The devastating earthquake of 2005 remains etched in our collective memory, a tragedy that reshaped communities and validated the strength, compassion, and resilience of the people of Pakistan,” PM Shehbaz said.\n\nThe prime minister also acknowledged the repeated tests of national resolve in the face of climate-induced disasters, referencing this year’s severe monsoon floods, which displaced millions and caused large-scale damage across the country.\n\n“Alhamdulillah, we once again exhibited our traditional resilience against climate-induced natural hazards,” he said, adding that the government continues to stand firmly with the people in times of crisis.\n\nThe premier also pointed to the country’s growing capacity in early-warning systems and emergency response infrastructure.\n\nHe called on all sectors of society, from provincial governments and armed forces to humanitarian organisations and civil society, to maintain unity of purpose. “We have learnt to mobilise all national resources. While the task ahead has always been enormous, the resolve remained matching, vibrant, and arrayed,” he said.\n\nAcknowledging the complex and evolving nature of climate threats, PM Shehbaz emphasised the need for data-driven and community-led approaches to disaster risk reduction.\n\n“Floods, earthquakes, heatwaves, forest fires, droughts, urban flooding and glacial melts are all stark reminders of the risks we face. Building resilience in such a complex environment demands a comprehensive and proactive approach enabled by reliable data, advanced risk analyses and targeted preparedness,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 8th, 2025",
