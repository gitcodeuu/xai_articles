The gathering was aimed at finding a figure whose appeal spans the centre-right to centre-left in order to steer the budget for 2026 through a fragmented and fractious parliament.\n\nParty leaders from the left, right and centre arrived at the Elysee, but the far-right National Rally (RN) and hard-left France Unbowed (LFI) — two of the largest political parties in the National Assembly — were excluded.\n\nWhile reacting to the reappointment of PM Lecornu, RN President Jordan Bardella said, “The Lecornu II government, appointed by Emmanuel Macron who is more isolated and out of touch than ever at the Elysee Palace, is a bad joke, a democratic disgrace and a humiliation for the French people.”\n\nSocialist Party lawmaker Francois Kalfon said, “Our scepticism grows by the day. We want something concrete on the pension reform. We are not afraid to return to the polls.”\n\nNational Assembly President Yael Braun-Pivet said, “I note the reappointment of Sbastien Lecornu as Matignon. For weeks now, the National Assembly has been in full working order, ready to play its role to the full: debating, scrutinising and voting. Now it’s time to get down to work. It’s about time!”\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 11th, 2025",
