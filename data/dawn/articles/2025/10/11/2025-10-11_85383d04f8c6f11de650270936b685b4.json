He expressed the hope that the SLA with the IMF would be finalised next week during his visit to Washington.\n\nThe minister said Pakistan’s economy had achieved macroeconomic stability and was now undergoing structural reforms in energy, taxation, and other sectors to ensure long-term sustainability. He added that three global rating agencies had acknowledged improvements in the country’s economic indicators.\n\nMr Aurangzeb said the government had completed a rapid assessment of recent floods, noting that rehabilitation of flood victims remained a major challenge.\n\nHe said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had identified two key priorities in his economic vision — taxation reforms and digitalisation. The formal sector, he said, was burdened because the informal economy was not contributing as it should. He added that Pakistan needed to move toward a cashless economy as 40-50 per cent of its economic activity remained undocumented.\n\nAccording to a press release, the dialogue between OICCI, PBC and Saudi investors focused on strengthening strategic economic cooperation and identifying new avenues for investment and trade between the two countries.\n\nABAD, SPBC sign MoU\n\nThe Association of Builders and Developers of Pakistan (ABAD) and the Saudi Pakistan Business Council (SPBC) on Friday signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to strengthen economic cooperation between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.\n\nUnder the agreement, ABAD and SPBC have established a framework to promote bilateral relations, encourage investment opportunities, and expand trade and construction-related collaboration between the two nations.\n\nBoth organisations will encourage Saudi investment in Pakistan’s construction and real estate sectors and explore joint ventures in development projects.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 11th, 2025",
