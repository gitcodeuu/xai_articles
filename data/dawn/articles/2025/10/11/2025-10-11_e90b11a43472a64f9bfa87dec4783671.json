  "content": "GUWAHATI: New Zealand captain Sophie Devine continued her golden run of form with a gutsy 63 to help the Kiwis to their first win at the Women’s World Cup as they crushed Bangladesh by 100 runs in Guwahati on Friday.\n\nNew Zealand, who last year won the T20 World Cup, had found the going tough on India’s sluggish tracks, slipping to defeats in their first two games against defending champions Australia and South Africa.\n\nBut against Bangladesh, they finally hit their straps, led from the front by their talismanic skipper Devine who shared a 112-run partnership with Brooke Halliday who top-scored with 69.\n\nIt was another outstanding effort from the captain after opting to take first strike.\n\nDevine posted 112 against Australia and 85 versus South Africa, both in losing causes, but this time her effort did not go in vain.\n\nHer gritty half-century laid the foundation for a competitive total after the Kiwis had wobbled to 38-3.\n\nThere was a moment of concern mid- innings when Devine, who manages Type 1 diabetes, had to halt play to check her blood sugar levels. Out came a few sweets and a sugary drink before she was back at the crease.\n\n“With diabetes, it’s always a bit of a balancing act,” Devine admitted later.\n\n“I had to take a few jelly bea­ns and coke to get going. It wa­s­n’t the prettiest innings but som­e­times you’ve got to do it ugly.”\n\nHer knock of 63 off 85 balls, laced with two fours and two sixes, provided the spine of the innings.\n\nThe other New Zealand great Suzie Bates, who had collected consecutive ducks earlier in the tournament, finally found some form with 29 studded with six boundaries before a mix-up saw her run out just when she was looking set.\n\nHalliday made sure the innings didn’t lose momentum, cashing in on the platform to notch up a fluent 69 featuring five fours and a six.\n\nBangladesh’s reply never got out of first gear. Their top five batters failed to reach double figures and it took them 15 overs to find their first boundary.\n\nJess Kerr caused trouble at the top of the order with 3-21 while Lea Tahuhu ensured the­re was no fightback with 3-22.\n\nBangladesh folded tamely with leg-spinner Fahima Khatun waging a lone battle. She top-scored with 34 before becoming the last wicket to fall as she skied a delivery from Eden Carson out to extra-cover.\n\nNew Zealand sit fifth in the eight-team table, one place outside the semi-final spots, level on points with Bangladesh who are one place below.\n\nThe White Ferns now head to Colombo for their games against Sri Lanka and Pakistan before wrapping up their group stage in Bombay with matches against hosts India followed by England in Vizag.\n\n“Our batting is not consistent. The lower order has done a decent job, but the top order needs to shoulder more responsibility,” Bangladesh skipper Nigar Sultana conceded after the defeat.\n\nHer team face South Africa and Australia in Visakhapatnam before taking on Sri Lanka and India in Mumbai.\n\nScoreboard\n\nNEW ZEALAND:\n\nS.
