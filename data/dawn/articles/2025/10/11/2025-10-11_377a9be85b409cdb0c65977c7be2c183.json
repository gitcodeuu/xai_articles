He demanded that the government must take care of the people of these areas.\n\nSpeaking on the TLP protest on Gaza, that paralysed the life in various cities due to blockades by the police, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq and parliamentary secretary Asia Ishaq questioned that if the people of Palestine were happy in the recent peace agreement between Israel and Hamas, then why TLP was coming to the capital for protest.\n\nThe issue of poverty also thoroughly discussed in the house where MNA questioned the government data about poverty and said the government’s recent survey did not match with the data of the World Bank.\n\nMNA Mehtab Rashidi questioned that despite all claims of the government that much has been done to overcome poverty, the on-ground reality spoke otherwise.\n\nResponding to questions during the Question Hour, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chaudhry informed the house that the government formally established the Pakistan Crypto Council on PM’s directives to develop a regulatory and operational framework, but the government neither intends to promote nor discourage cryptocurrency.\n\nSalaries before Diwali\n\nLater, MNA Sanjay Perwani on Friday urged the federal and provincial governments to ensure that Hindu government employees receive their salaries before Diwali, which falls on October 20.\n\nSpeaking in the House about the upcoming festival, he said that the timely payment of salaries would enable Hindu employees to celebrate their religious occasion with ease and dignity.\n\nDigitalisation of assembly\n\nEarlier, NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq announced that the digitalisation process has been initiated to establish an e-Parliament, aimed at modernising the legislative system.\n\nSpeaking at the start of the National Assembly session, the Speaker said the digitisation work had almost been completed in the Secretariat, while the system would soon be extended to the Parliament Lodges for the facilitation of members.\n\nSenate\n\nThe upper house of the parliament was prorogued on Friday without taking up any agenda item due to lack of quorum.\n\nAs the proceedings of the house began, PTI leader Humayun Mohmand pointed out quorum. The chair read out the president’s prorogation order after the headcount.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 11th, 2025",
