  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday granted bail to two interned brothers, who owned a dilapidated building in Lyari that collapsed and killed 27 residents in July.\n\nA single-judge SHC bench headed by Justice Omar Sial observed that all Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) officials nominated in the case had already granted bail and the applicants also deserved the same concession on the grounds of consistency.\n\nOn July 7, one of the two portions of a ground-plus-five-storey building in Lyari was collapsed in July this year in which 27 residents lost their lives and four sustained injuries.\n\nRahim Bux and Taj Muhammad, owners of the collapsed building, approached the SHC through their counsel after the trial court had dismissed their post-arrest bail applications.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, the bench noted: “The learned additional prosecutor general has been unable to distinguish the case against the applicant from that against the individuals who have been granted bail. On the grounds of consistency, the applicant, too, deserves the same concession. The applicant [Rahim] is an aged and infirm man who is not required for any further investigation.”.\n\nIt allowed their bail applications against a surety bond of Rs500,000 each.\n\nTen officials of SBCA including six directors, two deputy directors and as many building inspectors as well as two clerks were also named as accused persons in the FIR and they all have already obtained bail.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 11th, 2025",
