The committee, he noted, has been tasked with formulating concrete recommendations to expedite the resolution of such cases and to review proposals from the Attorney General for Pakistan (AGP) concerning the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.\n\nParticipants acknowledged that the establishment of specialised commercial benches across the high courts has already produced encouraging results by reducing case pendency. Justice Siddiqui appreciated these outcomes and suggested extending the specialised bench model to cases involving foreign arbitral awards to ensure swift and expert adjudication.\n\nJudicial policy-making body moves to curb delays in commercial, revenue litigation\n\nThe FBR chairman while welcoming judiciary’s proactive engagement, reaffirmed the FBR’s commitment to strengthening institutional coordination and ensuring the expeditious resolution of revenue-related disputes. He also endorsed the proposal to establish a dedicated legal department within FBR to ensure consistent legal strategy and institutional support.\n\nConcluding the session, Justice Siddiqui reaffirmed the judiciary’s resolve to enhance judicial efficiency and foster effective inter-institutional collaboration, terming it vital for strengthening economic governance and improving the ease of doing business. The committee’s recommendations will be submitted to the NJPMC for consideration in its forthcoming meeting.\n\nEarlier, the subcommittee was constituted during the 54th meeting of the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee held in August.\n\nThe body, headed by Supreme Court Judge Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, was tasked with addressing the issue of protracted litigation and injunctive orders in commercial, revenue, and fiscal cases, and to formulate appropriate recommendations.\n\nOther members of the subcommittee include LHC’s Justice Abid Aziz Sheikh, SHC’s Justice Agha Faisal, PHC’s Justice Arshad Ali, AGP and FBR chairman.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 11th, 2025",
