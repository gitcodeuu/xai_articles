  "content": "A magnitude 5 earthquake struck close to Punjab’s Layyah on Saturday night, according to the Pakistan Meteoreological Department (PMD).\n\nThe PMD said the quake occurred 50 kilometres east of Layyah at 7:54pm at a depth of 20km.\n\nLayyah Rescue 1122 Spokesperson Waseem Hayat told Dawn.com: “The earthquake was felt in the district but no emergency was reported.’’\n\nPakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.\n\nThe development comes just days after jolts from an earthquake of magnitude 5.2 were felt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chitral and Swat districts on Tuesday.\n\nA 5.0-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Quetta on Sunday evening.\n\nA 4.3-magnitude earthquake was recorded in KP last Saturday as well.",
