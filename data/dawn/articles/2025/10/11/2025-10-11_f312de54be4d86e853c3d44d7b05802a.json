There’s no electricity. We have nothing to eat.”\n\nThe destruction came less than two weeks after a 6.9 magnitude quake struck the central Philippine island of Cebu, killing 75 people and wrecking about 72,000 houses.\n\nPresident Ferdinand Marcos had instructed government agencies to continue relief operations, according to Presidential Communications Office secretary Dave Gomez.\n\n“The President’s paramount concern is the safety and well-being of our people in the earthquake-struck areas,” Gomez told reporters.\n\nSome people in Manay slept in tents, under improvised tarps and hammocks, inside vehicles, and on mats laid out in parks or the sides of streets as aftershocks rippled across the region of 1.8 million people.\n\nAt the heavily damaged Manay government hospital, patients lay on beds outside waiting for treatment.\n\nMany had been wheeled out on Friday because government engineers said the building had been structurally compromised.\n\nNearby shopkeepers cleaned up broken glass and put merchandise back on shelves, AFP journalists saw.\n\nVilma Lagnayo scrambled to save her family’s clothes and belongings from their collapsed home in Manay, a town with poor coastal communities that rely on coconut farming and fishing.\n\n“Reconstructing (our home) is difficult now… Money is a problem,” Lagnayo said.\n\nThe Philippine seismology office has recorded more than 800 aftershocks since the first quake struck Mindanao, which is riddled by major faults. It said these are expected to last for weeks.\n\nIn Mati, about two hours drive southwest along the coast, Margarita Mulle and her relatives held a wake for her older sister, who had earlier died from a disease, even as neighbours stayed away after tsunami warnings that have since been lifted.\n\n“In case something happens, they (relatives) will carry the body using a ‘tora-tora’,” a tearful Mulle said, using a local term for a hand tractor-drawn cart that is a major mode of transport in rural areas of the south.\n\nEarthquakes are a near-daily occurrence in the Philippines, which is situated on the Pacific “Ring of Fire”, an arc of intense seismic activity stretching from Japan through Southeast Asia and across the Pacific basin.\n\nAn 8.0-magnitude quake off Mindanao island’s southwest coast in 1976 unleashed a tsunami that left 8,000 people dead or missing, the Philippines’ deadliest natural disaster.",
