In 1QFY26, the company’s total sales rose by 46pc to 4,880 units compared to the same period last year.\n\nSales surge 53pc in first quarter on stable economy, low interest rates\n\nPak Suzuki Motor Company Limited (PSMCL), assembler of Alto, Swift, Cultus and Every, recorded 79pc YoY and 26pc MoM sales growth to 8,997 units in September. During 1QFY26, PSMCL’s sales increased by 51pc to 19,831 units compared to the same period last year.\n\nMyesha Sohail said Sazgar Engineering Works Limited (SEWL) reported a 73pc YoY and 36pc MoM rise to 1,429 units in September, which included sales of the newly launched HAVAL H6 PHEV variant. Total Sazgar vehicle sales during 1QFY26 jumped 37pc to 3,557 units compared to the same period last fiscal.\n\nHyundai Nishat (Elantra, Sonata, Tucson, Santa Fe and Porter) recorded 56pc YoY growth but a 3pc MoM decline to 1,175 units in September. The company sold 80pc more units in 1QFY26, reaching 3,612 units compared to the same period last year.\n\nIndus Motor Company (IMC), assembler of Toyota Corolla, Fortuner, Revo and Yaris, posted a 33pc YoY rise, though sales were down 7pc MoM to 3,152 units in September. In 1QFY26, IMC’s sales rose 61pc to 9,889 units compared to the same period last fiscal.\n\nBikes, tractors\n\nDespite the recent exit of Yamaha Motorcycles from Pakistan, two- and three-wheeler sales increased by 21pc YoY and 7pc MoM to 158,941 units in September this year, taking 1QFY26 sales to 431,542 units, up 35pc YoY.\n\nAtlas Honda Limited (AHL), maker of the popular CD70 bike, recorded its highest-ever monthly sales at 135,603 units in September.\n\nTractor sales dropped 27pc YoY and 21pc MoM to 790 units in September 2025, mainly due to floods and weak farm economics. However, production of 2,077 units during the month suggests underlying demand from the tractor scheme, indicating a possible rebound in the coming months. Total tractor sales during 1QFY26 fell to 2,981 units from 5,206 in the same period last fiscal.\n\nTruck and bus sales surged to 824 units in September 2025, up 158pc YoY and 24pc MoM, taking 1QFY26 sales to 1,864 units compared to 926 units in 1QFY25.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 11th, 2025",
