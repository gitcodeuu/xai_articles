The persistent pressure has led to widespread destruction of homes and property.\n\nThe breaches have severely impacted the M5 motorway and Gilani Road, with floodwater crossing the motorway and forming a lake between the two routes. Damage has been reported at five to six points along the motorway, prompting authorities to execute a controlled breach at Gilani Road to divert water toward the Chenab River and prevent further deterioration.\n\nAs a result, the M5 motorway has remained closed from Uch Sharif interchange to Jalalpur Pirwala for the past 15 days, disrupting traffic between southern and central Punjab, stranding thousands of vehicles and forcing commuters onto hazardous alternate routes.\n\nA district administration official told Dawn on condition of anonymity that floodwater continues to flow from the three breaches, although the water level has begun to recede slightly due to a drop in Sutlej River flow from 80,000 to 20,000 cusecs.\n\nHe said that many affected residents remain in relief camps near Lodhran, Ahmadpur and other areas, awaiting the complete closure of the breaches.\n\nHe said that the floodwater is currently crossing the M5 motorway through culverts and moving towards the Chenab River.\n\nMultan Irrigation Department Chief Engineer Nawaz Bajwa said that four of the seven cracks at the Noraja Bhutta Flood Bank in Jalalpur Pirwala have been repaired, with work on the remaining three progressing rapidly.\n\nPunjab Minister for Irrig­ation Kazim Ali Pirzada also noted that the restoration of the flood bank is underway and that water levels are gradually receding in the affected areas.\n\nHe said that a loss assessment survey is being conducted and that relief packages will be distributed accordingly.\n\nFlood survey\n\nThe Punjab government on Sunday kicked off a survey to assess the losses suffered by people in the province due to recent floods but refrained from giving any timeline for completing the exercise or for the start of compensation payments to the more than four million affected residents.\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz was informed at a meeting on Tuesday that flood survey teams have collected data of 27,500 people. The teams have also completed the survey of 48,071 acres of flood-affected land, besides obtaining data of 8,305 houses destroyed by the flood.\n\nThe teams also obtained records of 1,712 livestock killed during the flood. She was also briefed that 1,429 flood survey teams had been mobilised in flood-affected areas in 26 districts of Punjab.\n\nShe directed the commissioners, deputy commissioners and assistant commissioners to support and monitor the survey teams.\n\nThe Punjab government said that 2,200 survey teams comprising 10,000 members of the Pakistan Army, revenue, agriculture, and livestock departments, and district administration would carry out the survey.\n\nFull compensation to the affected families — Rs1 million for a destroyed house, Rs500,000 for a partially damaged house, Rs500,000 for loss of livestock, and Rs20,000 per acre (up to 12 acres) for farmers — will be provided based on the survey report, it said.\n\nZulqernain Tahir also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 1st, 2025",
