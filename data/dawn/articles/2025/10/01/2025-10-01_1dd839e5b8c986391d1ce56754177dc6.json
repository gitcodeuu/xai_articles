While some of these ice grains fell back to the moon’s surface, others collected around one of Saturn’s many rings.\n\nWhen Cassini flew through Saturn’s outermost “E” ring, it was “detecting samples from Enceladus all the time,” Nozair Khawaja, a planetary scientist at the Free University of Berlin and lead author of the new study, said in a statement from the European Space Agency.\n\nBy looking through these samples, scientists had previously identified numerous organic molecules — including the precursors of amino acids, which are fundamental building blocks of life.\n\nBut these ice grains could have been altered after being trapped in the ring for hundreds of years — or beaten up by blasts of cosmic radiation.\n\nSo the scientists wanted to look at some fresh ice grains.\n\nLuckily, they already had access to some.\n\nWhen Cassini flew directly into the spray spewing from the moon’s surface in 2008, grains of ice hit the spacecraft’s Cosmic Dust Analyser at around 18 kilometres a second.\n\nBut it took years to complete a detailed chemical analysis of these particles, which was the subject of the study published in the journal Nature Astronomy.\n\nStudy co-author Frank Postberg said the research proves that “the complex organic molecules Cassini detected in Saturn’s ‘E’ ring are not just a product of long exposure to space, but are readily available in Enceladus’s ocean”.\n\nFrench astrochemist Caroline Freissinet, who was not involved in the study, told AFP that there was “not much doubt” that these molecules were in the moon’s ocean.\n\nBut this confirmation provides “another piece in the puzzle,” she added.\n\nIt also shows that recent technology, such as artificial intelligence, allows scientists to perform new kinds of analysis on old data, she said.\n\nBut to get the best idea about what is happening on Enceladus, a mission would need to land near the icy geysers and collect samples, she added.\n\nThe European Space Agency has been studying the potential of a mission that would do just that.\n\nAfter all, “Enceladus ticks all the boxes to be a habitable environment that could support life,” the agency said in the statement.\n\nKhawaja added that “even not finding life on Enceladus would be a huge discovery, because it raises serious questions about why life is not present in such an environment when the right conditions are there.”",
