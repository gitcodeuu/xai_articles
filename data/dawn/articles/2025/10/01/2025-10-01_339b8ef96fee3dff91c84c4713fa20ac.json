  "content": "A 3.2-magnitude earthquake was recorded in Karachi on Wednesday morning, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.\n\nAccording to PMD, the earthquake was recorded seven kilometres north west of Malir at 9:34am, with a depth of 10km.\n\nIn June, the metropolitan city recorded a series of low-intensity tremors — starting from June 1 and ending on June 22 — mostly near Malir. Their intensity ranged from 1.5-magnitude to 3.8-magnitude on the Richter scale.\n\nAccording to experts, the fault lines passing along the areas of Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir had become active after several decades and were releasing accumulated energy in the form of low intensity earthquakes in areas close to them.\n\nPreviously, experts have often warned that a powerful seismic hazard can put the lives of thousands at risk and damage critical infrastructure.\n\nThe city’s close proximity to several seismic faults, including the Allahbund fault, which runs parallel to Sindh’s coast, and the junction of the Indian, Arabian and Eurasian plates, makes it susceptible to natural seismic activity.",
