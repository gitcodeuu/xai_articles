The meeting continued until late in the night on Thursday and talks with the government’s high-level committee were expected to resume on Friday morning.\n\nA strike has paralysed Azad Jammu and Kashmir under a communications blackout after talks over elite privileges and reserved refugee seats collapsed between the JKJAAC, the AJK government and federal ministers, sparking protests and violence. On Wed­nesday, the AJK prime minister and Parliamentary Affairs Mini­ster Tariq Fazal Chaudhry invited the alliance for fresh dialogue.\n\nOn Thursday, the entire region observed a complete shutter-down and wheel-jam strike for the fourth consecutive day, under a ceaseless communications blackout imposed since Monday. No fresh incidents of violence were reported.\n\nThough government offices and banks technically remained open, attendance was negligible. Interestingly, many government officials avoided using official vehicles for commuting and instead preferred to walk or use rented motorcycles.\n\n‘Enemies of Pakistan’\n\nBefore the delegation left for AJK capital Muzaffarabad, members of the government negotiating committee spoke to the media in Islamabad and stressed the need for dialogue to end the unrest that has gripped AJK for the past three days, Dawn.com reported.\n\nPlanning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said the government should play its role to address the issues in AJK. However, he added that given the present situation in the region and the world, some “elements would want to disturb peace and stability in Pakistan to push forward their agendas”.\n\nHe said the government remained committed to resolving the issues of the people of AJK, but they should also be mindful that no such situation was being created, which “Pakistan’s enemies” could take advantage of.\n\nAJK PM Haq thanked Prime Minister Shehbaz for issuing directives for sending a “high-level delegation” for restarting talks in the region and expressed the hope that members of the JKJAAC would also work towards ending the impasse in negotiations between the two sides.\n\nRaja Pervaiz Ashraf said, “We are all saddened and concerned over the situation. We will try our best to fulfil the just demands of the people of Kashmir and steer them out of the current situation at the earliest as the enemies of Pakistan and Kashmir would have their own objectives.”\n\nRana Sanaullah also emphasised that “violence is not the solution” to any problem. He said they aimed to resolve the matters in accordance with the law and Constitution, ensuring the restoration and maintenance of peace.\n\nAmir Muqam also thanked PM Shehbaz for addressing the issue. “We want the protest and the difficulties of the people of Kashmir to end. We hope that [JKJAAC] members would consider this … and engage with us for talks.”\n\nSardar Muhammad Yousuf, Qamar Zaman Kaira and Tariq Fazal Chaudhry also shared similar views. The Ministry of Interior also convened an important meeting in Islamabad on Thursday to consider steps to defuse the situation.\n\nPM calls for peace\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the Prime Minister’s Office on X earlier on Thursday, PM Shehbaz had directed the negotiation committee to immediately proceed to Muzaffarabad.\n\nAccording to the statement, the prime minister voiced deep concern over the law and order situation in AJK as Wednesday’s violent protests left three policemen dead. He urged citizens to remain peaceful and instructed law enforcement agencies to show restraint.\n\n“The prime minister has made a strong appeal to citizens to remain peaceful. He has urged that peaceful protest is the constitutional and democratic right of every citizen, but protesters should refrain from causing harm to public order.”\n\nThe premier also directed that law enforcement agencies exercise restraint and patience with the protesters.\n\n“The prime minister has said that respect for public sentiments must be ensured, and any unnecessary harshness should be avoided,” the statement said, adding that the government was always ready to address the issues of its Kashmiri brothers.\n\nExpressing “deep concern over the unfortunate incidents during the protests”, the premier ordered a transparent investigation into the matter.\n\nFunerals in Muzaffarabad\n\nEarlier in the day, hundreds of people gathered at Khurshid Football Stadium and the AJK capital’s famous Lala Chowk to attend the funerals of two people killed in an alleged police firing in Muzaffarabad.\n\nAddressing the mourners, Mr Mir of JKJAAC updated the crowd on the latest developments, vowing that the struggle would continue until the acceptance of key demands.\n\nThese include the abolition of 12 refugee seats, withdrawal of elite privileges, implementation of a June 2019 High Court decision regarding agreements on power projects in AJK, and provision of health cards.\n\nHe stressed that before discussing these issues, the alliance would demand the immediate arrest and exemplary punishment of those responsible for killing “unarmed protesters” in Muzaffarabad, Dhirkot and other areas of AJK.\n\nHe also sought a public mandate to engage in negotiations with the official committee, pledging that there would be no compromise on people’s rights.\n\nReports from Kohala, a border town about 35km away, said that thousands of people from AJK’s southern districts had reached there by evening.\n\nA source told Dawn that JKJAAC leaders had directed the crowd to wait in Kohala until further instructions after the conclusion of their consultations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 3rd, 2025",
