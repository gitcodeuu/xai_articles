  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Thursday approved the Balochistan Provincial Assembly (Special Privileges Amendment) Bill 2025, aimed at providing enhanced protection and security cover to the speaker, deputy speaker, ministers, opposition leader, and members of the provincial assembly (MPAs).\n\nThe bill was presented in the House by Provincial Health Minister Bakht Mohammad Kakar on behalf of the government and was passed with a majority vote. Lawmakers termed the legislation “necessary for safeguarding the democratic process” and ensuring that public representatives can perform their constitutional duties without intimidation or security concerns.\n\nUnder the bill, the Balochistan Assembly speaker will be entitled to at least 10 security personnel, while the deputy speaker and provincial ministers will each be provided eight guards. The leader of the opposition will be entitled to six guards, parliamentary secretaries to two, and every other member of the assembly will be entitled to six guards during their tenure.\n\nTwo resolutions adopted\n\nThe House also adopted two resolutions. The first, presented by Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch, demanded that the Gwadar Municipal Committee be upgraded to the status of a Municipal Corporation. He argued that Gwadar, as a port city and the country’s future economic hub, deserved this status, noting that the government had already granted such recognition to many other towns.\n\nProvincial Irrigation Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani and Parliamentary Secretary Majeed Badini suggested an amendment, proposing that Dera Murad Jamali should also be given the status of a Municipal Corporation. The amendment was supported by Mir Khair Jan Baloch, Asghar Ali Tareen, Barkat Ali Rind, Rehmat Saleh Baloch, and Mir Ali Madad Jattak. The resolution was adopted with the proposed amendment.\n\nThe second resolution, moved by JUI-F’s Syed Zafar Ali Agha, called for a uniform education system across the province with updated and relevant curricula. It recommended free education at least up to matriculation, strict monitoring of examinations, eradication of cheating and favoritism, and the establishment of a comprehensive teacher training programme.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 3rd, 2025",
