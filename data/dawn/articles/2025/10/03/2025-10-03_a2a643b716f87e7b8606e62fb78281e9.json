Sending people to Belarus is not the sole objective; the real task is to provide them with a safe and productive environment there,” he remarked.\n\nChairman of the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme, Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan, said that the PM’s Youth Programme was the largest initiative of its kind in the region, empowering youth economically.\n\nHe added that 600,000 young people have registered on the programme’s portal, alongside 700,000 national and international companies.\n\nHe added that all provinces were partners in the programme and the government was committed to equipping youth with skills to ensure economic benefits.Deputy Ambassador of the European Union, Philip Oliver, highlighted that skilled individuals have the capacity to transform societies. With more than 60% of Pakistan’s population being youth, their skill development could set Pakistan on the path of progress.\n\nNAVTTC Chairperson Gulmina Bilal said that major stakeholders from Germany, the UK, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the UAE participated in the dialogue, reflecting global recognition that Pakistan’s future lies in vocational and technical education.\n\nShe added that NAVTTC’s curriculum was aligned with international standards and industry requirements.The purpose of the dialogue was to bring together industry leaders, education experts and government officials to promote vocational and technical training as a means to achieve sustainable economic development.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 3rd, 2025",
