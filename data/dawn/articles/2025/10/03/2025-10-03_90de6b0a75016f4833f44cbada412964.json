Premadasa Stadium here on Thursday.\n\nAfter winning the toss, skipper Fatima Sana elected to bat on a pitch where few, if any, deliveries misbehaved throughout the match. However, the perfect batting conditions could not prevent the trademark Pakistan batting collapse to start off a World Cup from taking place.\n\nThe last encounter between the two sides was in Lahore in the World Cup Qualifiers, and Pakistan had nearly knocked out the Tigers from the World Cup itself when they won in style with seven wickets in hand.\n\nIt was only due to a freak innings of 70 of just 29 by the West Indies skipper Hayley Matthews that got the run-rate permutations to tilt in their favour, and on a plane from Dhaka to the World Cup.\n\nHowever, in the Sri Lankan capital, the scripts were flipped completely as Bangladesh romped home in style — losing just three wickets in their pursuit of a paltry 129.\n\nMarufa Akter set the momentum from the get-go with a double blow that Fatima’s side never recovered from.\n\nThe lanky right-arm pacer found movement early on to get rid of Omaima Sohail and, more importantly, Sidra Amin, eventually being adjudged of player-of-the-match for her exploits.\n\nThe veteran batter — fresh off two back-to-back centuries and a crucial 50 against the Proteas, fell for a golden duck as Marufa seamed one back in to make a mess of Sidra’s stumps.\n\nThere were just the fifth and sixth ball of the innings, but the writing was already on the wall — the teams had switched positions to do a complete 180 degree of the match situation in their previous encounter.\n\nThe Pakistan skipper also chalked that moment as the point where her team lost the plot, and to never recover from that point on.\n\n“We lost batters on the first and second balls of their innings today, we need to take our time and apply ourselves better going forward,” Fatima said at the post-match press conference.\n\nA handful of spectators, including school cricketers, had shown up for the match, with the odd Bangladesh and Pakistan flag visible in the stands.\n\nOne of those school cricketers, Bashaira, spoke about how she hoped the match would turn out into a close encounter, cheekily adding that a big fight could also be on the cards.\n\nWhat she and others who had turned up got instead was a crash course in the Pakistan way of starting a World Cup — showing up like one would at a mandatory stand-up meeting in the middle of a hectic work week — there in body, not in mind.\n\nFor all the talk of the camaraderie between the players of the two sides — especially the captains in the lead-up — there was quite a bit of chatter on the field as well, with both sides engaging in banter.\n\nPakistan had actually managed a mini-recovery by the end of the powerplay — from being 2-2 to 41-2 at the end of 10.\n\nThat, however, was short-lived as Muneeba Ali slashed one stra­i­ght to point off the other Akter in the Bangladesh side — Nahida.\n\nNahida then took a return off top-scorer Rameen Shamim (22) as Pakistan were left tottering at 47-4. They kept losing wickets with Fatima (22) becoming the seventh batter to depart with the score at exactly 100.\n\nAnother Akter, teenage leg-spinner Shorna, then came on to clean up the tail, returning remarkable figures of 3-5 in 3.3 overs, as Pakistan wound up in 38.3 overs.\n\nThe mid-innings break saw skipper Fatima and coach Mohammad Waseem have an animated discussion, but whatever they discussed came to nought as Bangladesh chased down the paltry total with ease thanks to an unbeaten 54 by opener Rubya Haider.\n\nPakistan had reduced Bang­ladesh to 35-2 but Rubya stitched a 62-run stand with skipper Nigar Sultana (23) and Bangla­desh eventually overhauled the target in the 32nd over.\n\nThe Women in Green take on India next on Sunday, and with all the happenings of the men’s Asia Cup over the past month, Fatima’s side will have to find a way to focus on the cricket itself if they are going to get their World Cup rolling.\n\n“We need to put this defeat behind us now and bounce back stronger,” said Fatima. “We have a lot of young players in our ranks and the World Cup is their first big tournament and hopefully they will learn from the mistakes.”\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nPAKISTAN:\n\nMuneeba Ali c Nishita b Nahida 17\n\nOmaima Sohail b Marufa 0\n\nSidra Amin b Marufa 0\n\nRameen Shamim c&b Nahida 23\n\nAliya Riaz c Marufa b Nishita 13\n\nSidra Nawaz lbw b Rabeya 15\n\nFatima Sana lbw b Fahima 22\n\nNatalia Pervaiz c Nigar b Shorna 9\n\nDiana Baig not out 16\n\nNashra Sandhu hit wicket b Shorna 1\n\nSadia Iqbal c Fargana b Shorna 4\n\nEXTRAS (LB-1, NB-1, W-7) 9\n\nTOTAL (all out, 38.3 overs) 129\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-2 (Omaima), 2-2 (Sidra Amin), 3-44 (Muneeba), 4-47 (Rameen), 5-67 (Sidra Nawaz), 6-91 (Aliya), 7-100 (Fatima), 8-113 (Natalia), 9-115 (Nashra)\n\nBOWLING: Marufa 7-0-31-2 (4w), Nishita 6-0-28-1, Nahida 8-1-19-2 (1w), Fahima 7-1-32-1 (1nb), Rabeya 7-2-13-1 (1w), Shorna 3.3-3-5-3\n\nBANGLADESH:\n\nFargana Hoque lbw b Diana 2\n\nRubya Haider not out 54\n\nSharmin Akhter lbw b Rameen 10\n\nNigar Sultana c Diana b Fatima 23\n\nSobhana Mostary not out 24\n\nEXTRAS (B-4, LB-1, W-13) 18\n\nTOTAL (for three wickets, 31.1 overs) 131\n\nDID NOT BAT: Shorna Akter, Fahima Khatun, Nahida Akter, Rabeya Khan, Marufa Akter, Nishita Akter Nishi\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-7 (Fargana), 2-35 (Sharmin), 3-97 (Nigar)\n\nBOWLING: Fatima 8-1-30-1 (3w), Diana 8-3-14-1 (2w), Sadia 6-0-21-0 (1w), Rameen 5-0-25-1 (1w), Nashra 3.1-1-27-0 (1w), Omaima 1-0-9-0\n\nResult: Bangladesh won by seven wickets.\n\nPLAYER-OF-THE-MATCH: Marufa Akter\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 3rd, 2025",
