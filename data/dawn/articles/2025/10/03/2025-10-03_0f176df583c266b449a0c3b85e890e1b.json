  "content": "Security forces killed seven terrorists during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Balochistan’s Sherani district, the military’s media affairs wing said on Friday.\n\nIn a statement, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said that on October 1, security forces conducted an IBO in Sherani on the reported presence of terrorists belonging to Indian proxy, Fitna al Khawarij.\n\nFitna al Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).\n\n“During the conduct of [the] operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, seven Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said.\n\nIt added that weapons, ammunition and explosives were also recovered from the terrorists, who remained actively involved in “numerous terrorist activities” in the area.\n\nAccording to the ISPR, a sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate other terrorists in the area.\n\n“The security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” it added.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif lauded the armed forces on the successful completion of the operation in Sherani, reiterating the state’s resolve to uproot the menace of terrorism“ from the country.\n\n“We will never allow those who seek to harm Pakistan’s integrity to succeed,” he said, according to the state-run Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).\n\nMeanwhile, Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti expressed pride for the security forces, who “stand as a shield for the defence of the homeland in every difficult time”.\n\n“The failure of Pakistan-hostile networks and Indian proxies in Shirani district is the result of the great sacrifices and splendid capabilities of our brave security forces,” the CM wrote in a post on X.\n\nPakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces. Attacks increased after the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.\n\nTwo reports, issued by Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) and the Centre for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) on Wednesday, about militant violence in the country over the past month, stated that the first three quarters of 2025 saw nearly as much violence as witnessed in all of 2024.",
