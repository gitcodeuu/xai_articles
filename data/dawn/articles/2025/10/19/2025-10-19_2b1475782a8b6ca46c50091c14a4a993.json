Judges may not publicly discuss judicial or administrative matters, nor disclose communications relating to personal or official affairs.\n\nThe council, acting on a decision first taken on July 12, deliberated on amendments proposed by the CJP. With some modifications, these were approved by the majority and ordered to be notified in the official gazette, circulated to all superior court judges and posted on the Supreme Court’s website.\n\nThe previous 2009 code had required judges to avoid publicity and political controversy, but did not contain the new media-interaction bar or response mechanism.\n\nA new Article XII directs judges to abstain from presiding over or attending social, cultural and diplomatic functions.\n\nArticle XIII treats the soliciting of conference or meeting invitations from foreign or international bodies as misconduct; any such invitations received personally must be routed via the relevant chief justice. Article XIV bars judges from accepting dinners or receptions hosted in their honour by individual members of the bar.\n\nArticle XV says that judges must decide cases on merit alone, possess the moral integrity and intellectual capacity to resist internal or external influence, and, where legal powers are lacking, seek an immediate institutional response.\n\nJudges must promptly inform, in writing, the CJP and the four most senior Supreme Court judges (via the registrar) of any such attempts; high court judges must also inform their respective chief justices.\n\nHigh court chief justices are to place such reports before a three-judge committee within two days, with a decision due within a fortnight.\n\nMatters sent for judicial determination are to be decided as early as possible by adhering to the principles of fair trial and due process. If a high court chief justice or committee fails to act within time, the CJP, with four senior Supreme Court judges, will take up the matter.\n\nThe code, originally framed by the SJC in 1962 and amended up to Oct 18, 2025, under Article 209 of the Constitution, is binding on all superior court judges.\n\nArticles I to IV and VI to XI — covering personal conduct, recusals, financial dealings, extra-judicial roles, gifts, collegiality, timely judgements and fidelity to the constitutional oath — remain in place.\n\nSJC on misconduct\n\nMeanwhile, the SJC examined 67 complaints under Article 209 filed by different individuals, of which 65 were unanimously closed, one was deferred, and one was ordered to be processed further by the majority.\n\nThe council was later reconstituted under Article 209(3b) with the inclusion of Peshawar High Court Chief Justice S.M. Attique Shah joining, after the Islamabad High Court chief justice expressed an inability to attend for certain agenda items.\n\nThe reconstituted council reviewed seven more complaints, closing five unanimously and deciding by majority to proceed further on two.\n\nAccording to an informed source, the SJC deferred the complaint against Justice Tariq Mahmood Jahangiri until Nov 20 and issued notice to another judge of the Islamabad High Court over allegations of delayed judgement.\n\nAfter decisions on the 74 complaints taken up at Saturday’s sitting, 87 cases remain pending initial consideration. The SJC has dealt with 155 matters since October 2024.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 19th, 2025",
