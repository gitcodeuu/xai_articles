However, he emphasised that all such initiatives must be carried out in accordance with the Constitution and the 18th Amendment.\\n\\nEarlier, the PPP chairman, along with several party leaders and workers, visited the Karsaz Martyrs’ Memorial to pay tribute to those who lost their lives in the terrorist attack on Oct 18, 2007, when former premier Benazir Bhutto returned to her homeland after exile.\\n\\nWhile speaking to the media after offering fateha at the site of the tragedy, he said that Pakistan’s history is marked by many painful incidents, and the events of Oct 18, 2007, stand among the “most tragic acts of terrorism in which several PPP workers were martyred.”\\n\\nHe added that the terrorist attack was not only a conspiracy against his mother and the PPP but also against the country and the federation itself.\\n\\n“Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto was the voice and the hope of the people. Despite the brutal terrorist attack, Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto never feared the terrorists, the extremists, or their facilitators. She neither bowed nor retreated; she continued her struggle with unwavering courage — until she was martyred on December 27, 2007,” he said.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Oct 18 anniversary was observed across Sindh with solemnity to remember the victims of the 2007 Karsaz bombing.
