These efforts include developing creditworthy project pipelines, issuing green bonds and creating carbon market mechanisms to attract investment, he added.\n\nFlood response\n\nIn a related development, the finance minister met World Bank President Ajay Banga in Washington on Friday and briefed him on the government’s flood response efforts. This meeting also took place on the sidelines of the plenary sessions of the IMF and World Bank, which Mr Aurangzeb attended during his six-day visit to Washington from Oct 13 to 18.\n\nAn official statement said Mr Aurangzeb briefed Mr Banga on the government’s comprehensive flood response efforts and appreciated the bank’s timely support following the post-flood damage assessment.\n\nThe minister also endorsed the proposal to leverage technology platforms and cooperatives to “effectively reach small farmers and enhance agricultural resilience,” the statement read.\n\nThe minister requested additional support under the International Development Association (IDA) windows in light of reduced allocations and discussed the importance of adopting a holistic approach to reforming Pakistan’s gas and power sectors to ensure long-term sustainability and efficiency.\n\nThe minister highlighted Pakistan’s Climate Prosperity Plan, which aims to shift the country from vulnerability to resilience and from risk to investment.\n\nSeparately, in a meeting with Turkiye’s Minister of Treasury and Finance Mehmet Simsek, Mr Aurangzeb highlighted Islamabad’s ongoing reform efforts in key sectors, including taxation, energy, state-owned enterprises (SOEs), privatisation, and public finance.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 19th, 2025",
