Many carried American flags while others shouted, “Hey hey ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go!”\n\nDemonstrators are up in arms over what they see as strongarm tactics since the Republican billionaire returned to the White House in January. Grievances include attacks on the media, the prosecution of political opponents and a vast immigration crackdown that has seen National Guard troops ordered into cities such as Los Angeles, Washington and Memphis.\n\nThe protests also come as a US government shutdown entered its third week, with the Trump administration firing thousands of federal workers amid a legislative impasse.\n\nThousands flooded New York’s Times Square, Boston Common and Chicago’s Grant Park. In Los Angeles, where organisers said they expected 100,000 people to attend, plans were made to float a giant balloon of Trump depicted in a diaper.\n\n“I never thought I would live to see the death of my country as a democracy,” Colleen Hoffman, a 69-year-old retiree, told AFP in New York. “We are in a crisis — the cruelty of this regime, the authoritarianism. I just feel like I cannot sit home and do nothing.”\n\nWhile Trump’s response to Saturday’s events was muted, his top surrogates were in more fighting form. House Speaker Mike Johnson called the day of protest the “Hate America rally”.\n\n“You’re going to bring together the Marxists, the Socialists, the Antifa advocates, the anarchists and the pro-Hamas wing of the far-left Democrat Party,” Johnson told reporters.\n\nRepublican lawmaker Tom Emmer also used the “Hate America” phrase and referred to participants as the “terrorist wing” of the Democratic Party.\n\nOther Republicans have voiced concerns that the marches could motivate political violence, especially following the September assassination of political activist Charlie Kirk, a close confidant of Trump.\n\nIn an interview with the Fox News show “Sunday Morning Futures”, Trump addressed the “No Kings” moniker directly. “They’re saying they’re referring to me as a king. I’m not a king,” he said.\n\nThe movement’s organisers, a coalition of more than 300 grassroots groups led by the progressive organisation Indivisible Project, framed the day as a defence of democratic principles.\n\n“There is nothing more American than saying we don’t have kings and exercising our right to peacefully protest,” said Leah Greenberg, co-founder of Indivisible.\n\nDeirdre Schifeling, chief political and advocacy officer for the American Civil Liberties Union, said protesters wanted to convey that “we are a country of equals.” The ACLU said it had given legal and de-escalation training to tens of thousands of people acting as marshals at the marches.\n\nSupport for the demonstrations came from top Democrats, including Sen Chuck Schumer, Sen Bernie Sanders and Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n“I say to my fellow Americans this No Kings Day: Do not let Donald Trump and Republicans intimidate you into silence,” Schumer wrote Saturday on X. “Speak out, use your voice, and exercise your right to free speech.”\n\nBeyond the United States, small protests took place Saturday in London, Madrid, Malaga, Spain and Malmo, Sweden.\n\nDana Fisher, a professor at American University and an author of several books on American activism, said the day’s main point was to build solidarity.\n\n“The main point of this day of action is to create a sense of collective identity amongst all the people who are feeling like they are being persecuted or are anxious due to the Trump administration and its policies,” Fisher said.\n\n“It’s not going to change Trump’s policies. But it might embolden elected officials at all levels who are in opposition to Trump.\"\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 19th, 2025",
