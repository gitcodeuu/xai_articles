  "content": "LAHORE: Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah on Saturday reiterated Islamabad’s stance that Pakistan will not be an aggressor, but warned that it will respond firmly to any attack.\n\n“Our policy is very clear: Pakistan will not initiate aggression against any neighbouring country,” Mr Sanaullah told rep­orters. “But if anyone attacks us, we will not leave that unanswered.” He added that the response may exceed what some have referred to as “score zero six,” — a reference to Pakistan’s downing of six Indian aircraft in the May 2025 war.\n\nSpeaking about relations with Afgha­nistan, the adviser said Pakistan had consistently supported its neighbour and expressed deep regret over repeated incidents that have cost Pakistani lives. “We have always stood with Afghanistan. It pains us that we continue to suffer from that side,” he said. “We cannot keep carrying the coffins of our loved officers.”\n\nExpresses regret over cross-border incidents from Afghanistan\n\nMr Sanaullah urged that a clear distinction be made between civilians and terrorists. “From now on, differentiate clearly between terrorists and ordinary people. If someone subscribes to an ideology of violence and terrorism and stands opposed to the state, there can be no dialogue with them,” he said.\n\nTurning to allegations of external involvement in militant activity, he accused India of complicity. “India is involved — to such an extent that it didn’t even bother to deny it. They are culpable,” he told the media. At the same time, he dismissed any suggestion that New Delhi could mount a ground invasion, warning that Pakistan’s armed forces would respond robustly if provoked. “India does not have the capacity to overrun us. If it attempts anything, our armed forces will strike back,” he said.\n\nOn the domestic front, the adviser said Punjab was ready for local government elections and pledged that the process would extend “down to the streets and neighbourhoods,” giving ordinary citizens opportunities to participate in governance.\n\nResponding to a question about a circulating video clip of Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, in which a small national flag was seen on his table while larger PTI and KP flags were displayed in the background, Mr Sanaullah said the footage had been edited. “There has been editing in the matter of the flags,” he said without elaborating.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 19th, 2025",
