  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pak­­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has lambasted the government for its silence over Israel’s massacre of Palestinians even after sig­­ning of the “peace plan”, warning it against becoming part of “any conspiracy, military action, or al­liance” targeting a Muslim country.\\n\\nIn a statement released on Saturday, the party ex­­pressed concern over the government’s silence on violation of the Gaza ceasefire accord.\\n\\nThe PTI wondered whe­ther the government had raised its voice at any int­ernational forum against Israel’s aggression against Palestinians, urging the ru­­lers to jolt the consci­en­­ce of “peace guarantors”.\\n\\nRegarding US President Donald Trump’s re­­marks that ‘fri­endly countries’ will send troops to Gaza, the PTI said Pakistan’s participation in any such plan or alliance would be against its national interest.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 19th, 2025",
