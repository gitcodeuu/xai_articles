Rejecting criticism of his young age and lack of administrative experience, the chief minister said that he had been accused of being too young and inexperienced, but every decision he had taken so far as the province’s chief executive was guided by the vision and principles of PTI founder Imran Khan.\n\nHe added that the results of all those decisions would “speak for themselves.”\n\nTouching upon the recent Hangu incident, Mr Afridi reaffirmed his party’s “principled” stand against military operations and drone attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n“Imran Khan has always opposed military operations that cause massive collateral damage. Despite repeated operations, terrorism continues to claim lives. This policy has failed our people. We will no longer accept decisions about the future of our province being made behind closed doors. Our people’s representatives must be part of every decision that affects their lives,” he said.\n\nReferring to his recent efforts to meet party detained founder Imran Khan, the CM said that he followed every constitutional and legal procedure, including correspondence with the Punjab home department, the federal government and even the Supreme Court’s chief justice.\n\n“Despite court orders, I was not allowed to meet my leader [Imran Khan] in jail, so I will now present my case directly before the people and let them decide about it,” he said,\n\nMr Afridi said that he was advised not to visit Charsadda, Khyber and Karak districts due to threats to his life.\n\n“My life, my office and even my death is a trust of my people, so I am not afraid of dying for them,” he said.\n\nThe rally was also addressed by PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar Khan, central leader Ahmad Khan Niazi, MNA Fazal Mohammad Khan, former provincial ministers Fazal Shakoor Khan, Arif Ahmedzai and Arshad Umarzai, MPA Khalid Khan Mohmand and others.\n\nSpeaker of the KP Assembly Babar Saleem Khan Swati and PTI leaders Ayesha Bano, Meena Khan Afridi, Atif Khan and Ali Asghar Khan were also present on the occasion.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",
