The court has given [Mr Afridi] the permission to meet [Imran Khan], and if there is no legal hindrance, I see no reason why the meeting should not take place,” he said in response to a question.\n\nHe also urged the KP government to have working relations with the federal government.\n\n“You need to hold talks to get your rights though a political process,” he added.\n\nHe said the PPP owned the 26th Constitution Amend­ment and it was not rolled out of compulsion, noting that it would not have become possible without his party’s support.\n\nThe Punjab governor said that his party had no knowledge about the 27th Consti­tution Amendment, adding that the PPP would only back it if is satisfied there was nothing wrong in it.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, KP Governor Kundi said CM Afridi recently took oath and his cabinet was yet to be finalised as he was in Rawalpindi to meet his party’s founder.\n\n“I understand that every political party has its own age­nda but whenever it involves province, I have already suggested a parliamentary jirga should be formed to talk to the federal government,” he said, noting that issues could be discussed in Council of Common Interest meetings.\n\nHe said that after merger of the tribal districts with KP, the province’s population had increased, adding that the PM had committed to hold meeting of the National Finance Commission (NFC) in August but it was delayed due to floods.\n\n“My doors are open. The Governor’s House will play role as a bridge between the provincial and federal government for peace and development of the province.”\n\nWhile talking about military operations in the province, Mr Kundi said the instable law and order situation in the merged districts was worsening with each passing day. “There is no other way except for intelligence-based operations.”\n\nHe said representatives of the federal government visited Kabul and the Afghan interim government was asked not to allow India and Israel use its land against Pakistan.\n\nMr Kundi noted that 80 per cent of the militant attacks in KP were being carried out in connivance with Afghanistan, adding that except for a facilitator, all the attackers on police training schools in Dera Ismail Khan were Afghan nationals.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",
