A formal cake-cutting ceremony will be held on the occasion. The guests will be presented with commemorative shields by the PIA CEO.\n\nAll passengers on board the inaugural flight will also be presented with special gifts as a memento of this historic flight.\n\nA lucky passenger who bought a PIA ticket through the ‘Go Lottery Digital App’ will be given a car in a draw. During the flight, passengers will also be presented with mobile phone gifts through a lottery conducted by PIA, said an official.\n\nThe restoration of this route is a strategic milestone for PIA. Such extraordinary initiative for passengers shows that the national airline is committed to providing the best possible service, he added.\n\nThe Pakistani flights were banned from flying to the European Union, the UK and the US in June 2020, after one of its Airbus A320 crashed in Karachi killing nearly 100 people on board.\n\nThe ban on flights followed the then aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan statement on the floor of parliament, terming pilots’ licences “dubious”. However, the ban on PIA flights to Europe was lifted in November 2024.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",
