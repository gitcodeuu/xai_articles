  "content": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump embarks on a major trip to Asia this week with all eyes on a meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping that has huge implications for the global economy.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday he was making a  “big trip” to Malaysia, Japan, and South Korea, his first visit to the region since he returned to the White House in a blaze of tariffs and geopolitical brinkmanship.\n\nThe highlight will be his talks with Xi in South Korea, which Trump’s spokeswoman confirmed would take place on October 30 on the sidelines of an Asia-Pacific Economic Coo­peration (APEC) summit.\n\nTrump had previously threatened to scrap the meeting amid a flare-up in the trade war between Washington and Beijing, but he said on Wednesday he now hoped for a  “deal on everything.” There was also a  “considerable” chance that Trump would meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un during his visit, said South Korea’s unification minister, Chung Dong-young. The host nations are meanwhile set to roll out the red carpet to ensure they stay on the right side of the unpredictable 79-year-old, and win the best deals they can on tariffs and security assistance.\n\nTrump will leave Washington on Friday and arrive on Sunday in Malaysia for the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) summit — a meeting Trump skipped several times in his first term.\n\nHe is set to ink a trade deal with Malaysia — but more importantly, to oversee the signing of a peace accord between Thailand and Cambodia, as he continues his quest for a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“President Trump is keen to see the more positive results of the peace negotiations between Thailand and Cambodia,” Mala­y­sian Prime Minister Anwar Ibr­ahim said. The US leader may also meet Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on the sidelines of the summit to imp­r­ove ties after months of bad blo­od, officials from both countries said.\n\nTrump’s next stop will be Tokyo on Monday, and he will meet conservative Sanae Takaichi, named this week as Japan’s first woman prime minister, on Tuesday.\n\nJapan has escaped the worst of the tariffs Trump slapped on countries around the world to end what he calls unfair trade balances that are  “ripping off the United States.”\n\nThe climax of the trip is expected to be South Korea, with Trump due to land in the southern port city of Busan on Wednesday, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\nTrump will then meet South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, address an APEC lunch with business leaders, and meet US tech bosses for dinner, the White House said, on the sidelines of the APEC summit in the city of Gyeongju.\n\nThe next day, Trump will meet Xi for the first time since his return to office. Global markets will be watching closely to see if the two men can halt the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies, especially after a recent row over Beijing’s rare earth curbs.\n\nTrump initially threatened to cancel the meeting and imposed fresh tariffs, before saying he would go ahead after all.\n\nHe said on Wednesday that he hoped to make a deal with Xi on  “everything” and also hoped the Chinese leader could have a  “big influence” on getting Russia’s Vladimir Putin to end the Ukraine war.\n\nBreakthrough unlikely\n\n“The meeting will be a data point along an existing continuum rather than an inflection point in the relationship,” said Ryan Hass, a senior fellow at Brookings Institution.\n\nSouth Korea, seeking its own trade deal, is reportedly considering the rare step of awarding Trump the Grand Order of Mug­unghwa — the country’s highest decoration — during his visit.\n\nNorth Korea will also be on the agenda. The country fired multiple ballistic missiles on Wednesday, just days before Trump was due to visit.\n\nSouth Korea has halted tours in parts of the Demilitarized Zone separating the two Koreas, officials said on Thursday, fueling speculation of a new meeting between Trump and Kim.\n\nNorth Korea appears  “to be paying attention to the United States and various signs… suggest a considerable possibility of a meeting,” unification minister Chung Dong-young said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",
