Further police investigation was being carried out, he added.\n\nLast month, Sala­h­u­ddin Achakzai, a prominent tribal elder of the Achakzai tribe, was shot dead and two others were injured when arm­ed men riding motorcycles targeted them on the outskirts of Chaman.\n\nIn late August, two men were gunned down when armed men opened fire on their car near Killi Dargai on Loralai-Dera Road. This came over a week after unknown motorcyclists shot dead a Counter Terrorism Department officer in Pishin Town, officials said on Friday.",
