Parents have warned of protests if the culprits are not arrested soon.\n\nThey urged the provincial government to take strict security measures to prevent such attacks in the future and to ensure the immediate reconstruction of the affected school so that students’ education is not disrupted.\n\nMeanwhile, four employees of a mobile phone company, who were abducted the other day, were safely recovered here on Friday.\n\nAccording to police officials, the employees were kidnapped from the Garah Bakhtiyar area while transporting tower and generator equipment.\n\nFollowing their abduction, a large-scale search and strike operation was launched in the area under the supervision of senior police officers.\n\nSub-divisional police officer Nawab Khan said that the abductees were released unconditionally by the kidnappers in Garah Mastan village of Kulachi tehsil of Dera, reportedly due to fear of the ongoing police operation.\n\nPolice further confirmed that a case had already been registered at the Counter-Terrorism Department police station against the unidentified abductors.\n\nThe officials reaffirmed their commitment to ensuring the safety of citizens and maintaining law and order in the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",
