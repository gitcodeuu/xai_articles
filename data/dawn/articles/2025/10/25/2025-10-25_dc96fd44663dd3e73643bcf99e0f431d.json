Attendance drops further with age — just 29.1pc of working adolescents aged 14-17 remain in school.\n\nAccording to the survey, 33.7pc of the poorest households have a child in labour, compared to 3.8pc among the wealthiest. Households receiving BISP support or facing economic shocks show higher child labour rates.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, the labour secretary said the findings of the survey were a stark reminder of the work that laid ahead of us. “We cannot accept a future where our children are deprived of education and childhood,” he said. The labour secretary said that the provincial government was committed to using this evidence to strengthen the enforcement of the Sindh Prohibition of Employment of Children Act, 2017, and to design targeted interventions that address the root causes of this issue, particularly in high-burden districts.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Unicef Chief of Child Protection Jennifer Melton emphasised the significance of the survey in shaping child protection policy and inter-sectoral collaboration across Sindh.\n\n“Every child deserves a childhood filled with learning, play, and opportunity-not labour,” she added.\n\nMs Melton said: “This survey gives us the data and insight needed to act decisively. Unicef remains committed to supporting the Government of Sindh to turn this evidence into stronger systems, better services, and brighter futures for all children.”\n\nDirector General-Labour Zulfikar Ali Nizamani welcomed the government-Unicef partnership and reaffirmed the department’s commitment to ending child labour through enforcement and awareness initiatives.\n\nProject Coordinator Reejhu Mal S. Sajnani and Survey Coordinator Izat Chachar presented the key findings, emphasising the importance of government, development partners, and communities working together to eradicate child labour.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 25th, 2025",
