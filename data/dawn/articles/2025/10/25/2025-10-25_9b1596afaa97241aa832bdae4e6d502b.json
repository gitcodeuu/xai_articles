But all in all, I’ll take the cricket that I played here.”\n\nIndia made a confident start to the chase after Mitchell Marsh won the toss and batted first only for Australia to be bowled out for 236.\n\nRohit and Shubman Gill put on 69 before Josh Hazlewood enticed a faint edge from the Indian captain.\n\nThat brought the 36-year-old Kohli to the crease and he and Rohit set about knocking off the runs quickly.\n\nRohit was almost flawless in reaching a 33rd ODI ton, with 13 fours and three sixes in his 121, while Kohli brought up a 75th half-century to steer them home.\n\n“Going out there and having a situation is always something that brings the best out of me and when Rohit is batting it’s pretty easy to kind of rotate the strike, we know each other’s game pretty well,” said Kohli.\n\n“We want to say thank you, we’ve loved coming to this country,” he added. “We’ve played some of our best cricket here so thank you very much.”\n\nEarlier, Australia were ticking along nicely at 183-3 but lost their last seven wickets for just 53.\n\nHarshit Rana did the damage with 4-39 while Matt Renshaw top-scored with 56.\n\nMarsh and Travis Head made a watchful start but once they got their eye in the runs started flowing.\n\nHead looked dangerous, hitting six fours in reaching 29 off 25 balls, passing 3,000 one-day runs en route. But he failed to control a cut shot off Mohammed Siraj and was caught at backward point.\n\nMarsh was bowled for 41, confounded by the spin of Axar Patel, and when Matt Short (30) fell to Washington Sundar Australia were 124-3 after 23 overs.\n\nShreyas Iyer pulled off a sensational backpeddling catch to remove Alex Carey (24) and it sparked a collapse.\n\nRenshaw reached a maiden ODI half-century, but with the runs drying up he charged at Sundar and was trapped lbw, before Mitchell Owen departed for one and Mitchell Starc for two leaving Australia in trouble at 201-7.\n\nCooper Connolly made a late 23 but the tail failed to wag.",
