It is not taking place because of the factors that you were aware of. There was considerable discussion on this question during last week’s briefing as well. Till the evaluation of the security situation, this transit trade will remain closed.”\n\nAdvertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayLoaded: 1.66%00:00Remaining Time -10:03MuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

But generally trans-boundary rivers are governed by international law. In such matter, Pakistan is both an upper and lower riparian. So, we will follow this matter.”\n\nThe Chitral river originates from Pakistan and is called Kunar when it enters Afghanistan. It joins the Kabul river near Jalalabad before re-entering Pakistan.\n\nBorder crossings between the two countries have remained closed since October 11, following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-kilometre frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.\n\nAll trade and transit have been blocked since the fighting erupted, Khan Jan Alokozay, the head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters on Thursday.\n\nThe border clashes were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan across their shared border, saying they operated from havens in Afghanistan. The Taliban has denied the charge.\n\nA ceasefire was agreed in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend and is holding between the two sides, but the border trade remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.\n\n“We have no information when the border with Afghanistan will be opened,” a senior official of the Chaman administration had said earlier.\n\nThe official added that even though the traders and the people involved in import and export are demanding the reopening of the border, no decision has been made so far.\n\nA senior official said that there was no chance of opening the border before the meeting between Islamabad and Kabul in Istanbul on Oct 25, where both sides will decide future plans in view of the recent clashes.\n\n“Trade and business activities between Pakistan and Afghanistan will be restored depending on the outcome of the Istanbul review meeting,” Imran Khan Kakar, a leading businessman, had told Dawn.\n\nThe border authorities opened the Friendship Gate for a limited time for the repatriation of Afghan refugees, who were reaching Chaman from different areas of Balochistan and Karachi.\n\nThe activities at the immigration section of the Federal Investigation Age­ncy (FIA) were also suspe­nded, and those who were going to Afghanistan using visas and passports were also stuck in Chaman due to the border closure.\n\n“Over 5,000 Pakistanis are stranded in Spin Boldak as they visit there and Vesh on a daily basis for their small businesses,” an FIA official said.",
