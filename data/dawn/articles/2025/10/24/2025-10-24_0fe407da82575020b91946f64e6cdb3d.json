If Punjab does not resume seed supply to Sindh immediately, the province’s overall wheat production could decline significantly,” he added.\n\nOn Wednesday, the PPP’s questions over the wheat procurement mechanism following the recent announcement of the minimum support price (MSP) at Rs3,500 per 40 kilograms created quite a stir between the two sides and drew a strong reaction from the Punjab government.\n\nIn May, the federal food minister told the National Assembly that Passco was being abolished as part of market deregulation. The policy has since been reversed under a national wheat policy, but procurement modalities remain contested.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, PPP Punjab Secretary General Hassan Murtaza asked at a press conference on Wednesday who would procure wheat and under what mechanism following Passco’s “abolition”. He said farmers were at the mercy of middlemen paying below the MSP.\n\nThe remarks drew a strong response from the Punjab government. Provincial Information Minister Azma Bokhari urged the PPP leadership to take notice of Mr Murtaza’s remarks, warning the PML-N would otherwise respond in kind.\n\nWith the dust barely settled, the PPP’s leadership from Sindh has now raised fresh objections, accusing the PML-N of depriving the province’s farmers of their due rights.\n\n“It’s a grave injustice to Sindh’s farmers and tantamount to economic exploitation of growers and haris [farm labourers],” said Mr Khuhro. “Pakistan produces about 552,000 tonnes of wheat seed annually, out of which Punjab-based seed companies account for roughly 516,000 tonnes. However, the Punjab government is reportedly preventing these companies from selling their wheat seed to Sindh.”\n\nAccording to the PPP leader, Sindh’s farmers and dealers have already paid Punjab-based suppliers for the seeds, yet the supply has been blocked. He described the move as “anti-Sindh” and discriminatory against the province’s farmers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 24th, 2025",
