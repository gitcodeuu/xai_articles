Of 511 registered arms dealers, Bokhari said 393 licences were deemed acceptable while 28 licences had been revoked.\n\nShe said that 1,092,646 citizens in Punjab had been registered as weapons holders. “Those possessing unlicensed firearms have been ordered to surrender them to police within one month, after which strict action will follow.”\n\nThe minister said the peace committees had been activated across Punjab and combing operations were under way against illegal Afghan residents to ensure law and order and uphold the state’s authority. She clarified that no mosque had been closed and Friday prayers would continue as usual.\n\nLoudspeaker use would be limited to the call for prayer and Friday sermons, and any incitement would be met with legal action.\n\nBokhari said during the TLP’s demonstrations police officers were attacked, vehicles were snatched, properties were set to fire and civilians were harmed.\n\nHome Department: The Punjab home department has cancelled the licences of 28 arms dealers and sealed shops of fake dealers besides initiating legal action.\n\nThe home department is currently in the process of verifying the authenticity of all arms dealers in the province.\n\nIt is learnt that some 511 arms dealers had applied for their licence verification.
