So far, an expenditure of Rs729.96 million has been incurred.\n\nThe meeting was informed that the administration and academic blocks were at the finishing stage, while the residential units were in advanced stages of completion. However, communal and extracurricular facilities are yet to commence due to insufficient and inconsistent fund releases.\n\nThe meeting was informed that the medical complex, located on National Highway near Razakabad, was designed to be a state-of-the-art healthcare and teaching facility for the residents of Gadap, Malir, the entire city of Karachi and adjoining areas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 24th, 2025",
