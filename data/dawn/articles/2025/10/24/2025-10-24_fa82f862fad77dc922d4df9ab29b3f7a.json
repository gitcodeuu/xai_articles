  "content": "More than 1,000 people, mostly Chinese, have fled from Myanmar into Thailand this week, Thai authorities said on Friday, after the Myanmar military raided one of the country’s largest scam centres.\n\nSprawling cyberscam hubs, where fraudsters swindle victims through online cons, have flourished along Myanmar’s loosely governed border during its years-long civil war.\n\nWhile some scammers are trafficked into the often-fortified compounds, experts say others work voluntarily, hoping to earn more in the multibillion-dollar illicit industry than they can at home.Advertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayLoaded: 0%Remaining Time -MuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.
