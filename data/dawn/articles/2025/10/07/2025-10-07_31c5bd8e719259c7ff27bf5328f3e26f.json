  "content": "Jolts from an earthquake of magnitude 5.2 were felt in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Chitral and Swat districts on Tuesday, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) said.\n\nPakistan falls on three major tectonic plates — the Arabian, Euro-Asian and Indian — which create five seismic zones under the country. The intersection of multiple fault lines means that tectonic movements remain a frequent occurrence in the region.\n\nToday’s quake, measuring a depth of 138 kilometres, originated in the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan at 4:36pm, the PMD said in a statement.\n\nAccording to the United States Geological Survey, the quake measured 5.1 and the epicentre was located 9km south-southeast of Afghanistan’s Yangi Qala district.\n\nThe development comes just days after a 4.3-magnitude earthquake was recorded in the Pattan tehsil of KP’s Lower Kohistan district.\n\nEarlier this month, a 3.2-magnitude tremor was felt in parts of Karachi, with its centre 7km northwest of the Malir area.\n\nResidents of KP witnessed tremors multiple times in September; once when an earthquake measuring 6.0 on the Richter scale hit southeastern Afghanistan on September 1.\n\nDays later, a 5.9-magnitude quake jolted several cities of KP — including Peshawar, Mansehra, Hangu, Abbottabad, Swat and Malakand — along with Islamabad and Rawalpindi.\n\nOn September 26, a quake of magnitude 5.5 centred in Afghanistan sent its tremors to various KP cities, including Chitral, Peshawar and Swat.",
