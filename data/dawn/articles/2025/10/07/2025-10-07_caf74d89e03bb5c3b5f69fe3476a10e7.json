The participants demanded that the government immediately withdraw the decision. They stated that education should not be turned into a business. Privatisation, they argued would halt the academic journey of poor students and restrict education to a limited segment of society.\n\nStudent leaders emphasised that education was a fundamental right of every citizen and that any attempt to make it expensive or limited in the name of privatisation would not be tolerated.\n\nThey demanded that the government formulate a new education policy in consultation with all stakeholders. During the protest, all roads in Shabqadar were closed to traffic, causing severe inconvenience to the public.\n\nStudents of Government Postgraduate College, Swabi, blocked the Swabi-Mardan Road for several hours to protest the outsourcing of colleges.\n\nThe protesting students, led by Pakhtun Students Federation, gathered on the premises of the institution and marched to Gohati Bus Stop.\n\nThe students were holding placards inscribed with different slogans against the ‘privatisation’ of the educational institutions.\n\nLater, the police officials assured the student leaders of conveying their concerns to the high officials of the education department, leading to opening of the road.\n\nStudents held a protest demonstration against the provincial government’s policy to outsource educational institutions at the College Chowk in Mardan on Monday.\n\nThe demonstration was organised by Jamiat Talaba Islam, Mardan chapter. The students blocked the main thoroughfare for several hours, causing a severe traffic jam.\n\nWhile addressing the gathering, JTI provincial general secretary Hafiz Farmanullah rejected the provincial government’s decision to hand over 55 public colleges to the private sector.\n\nHe stated that education was a national necessity and a fundamental right of students, which cannot be allowed to be ‘sold’ in the market for ‘business’ and ‘profit’.\n\n“This policy is actually designed to benefit a few capitalists and business elites, and it will primarily harm students from poor and middle-class backgrounds.”\n\nThe speakers asked the provincial government to focus on improving and reforming public sector educational institutions rather than handing them over to ‘capitalists’ under the guise of privatisation.\n\nIn Ekkaghund tehsil of Mohmand district, students of the government degree college staged a protest against the abolition of the BS programme, leading to the closure of the Peshawar-Bajaur Highway.\n\nThe students said the discontinuation of the BS programme threatened their educational future. College lecturers also boycotted classes.\n\nThe protesters chanted slogans against the government and demanded the immediate restoration of the programme.\n\nDuring the protest, former ANP MPA Nisar Mohmand and JUI-F leader Arshad Bakhtyar issued a three-day ultimatum, warning that if their demands were not met, protests would spread across the district.\n\nThey called on the Mohmand deputy commissioner to take urgent notice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 7th, 2025",
