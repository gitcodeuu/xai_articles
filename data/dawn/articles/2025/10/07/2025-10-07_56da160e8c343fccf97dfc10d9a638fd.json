The meeting was attended by Makran Commissioner Qadir Bakhsh Pirkani, former Balochistan High Court judge Justice Shakeel Ahmed Baloch, former District Council chairman Haji Fida Hussain Dashti, and others.\n\nDr Malik, who is former chief minister of Balochistan, asked engineers to take into account sewerage lines and the natural flow of water during construction to prevent urban flooding and inconvenience to residents during the rainy season. He urged the Turbat Municipal Corporation and other relevant departments to formulate a comprehensive working plan for modern and sustainable urban development.\n\nThe meeting also discussed recycling wastewater through treatment plants for reuse.\n\nDeputy project director of the Turbat City development project Behram Gichki informed the meeting that three major drainage systems of Turbat are being interconnected to divert wastewater outside the city to prevent health and environmental hazards.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 7th, 2025",
