  "content": "Israel has been facing damning criticism from across the globe over its relentless bombardment in Gaza over the past two years, with Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a United Nations inquiry already declaring its actions in the enclave as a “genocide”.\n\nIsrael imposed a total blockade on the Palestinian enclave on March 2 after ceasefire talks broke down. In late July, it began allowing a small trickle of aid to resume, following warnings of a wave of starvation. But the aid was too little and too late to reverse the damage already done; the UN officially declared a famine in Gaza City in August.\n\nAs today marks another year of the world witnessing piled up bodies in shrouds, spilt blood, shredded body parts, hungry cries for food and buildings reduced to rubble in Gaza, we take a look at some pictures that are an incriminating statement of Israel’s multiple war crimes in the enclave.\n\nHeader image: Smoke rises from an evacuated residential building that was housing displaced Palestinians, after it was hit by an Israeli air strike, in Gaza City on Sept 14, 2025, in this screen grab taken from a video. — Reuters TV via Reuters/Dawoud Abu Alkas",
