We know exactly where we stand and what we have to do.”\n\nEarlier, New Zealand — who won the toss and batted — rode on Devine’s 98-ball 85 in her 300th international, atoning for her long time friend Bates’s failure.\n\nDevine and Georgia Plimmer (31) lifted New Zealand from a precarious 44-2 with a 57-run stand for the third wicket while Brooke Halliday (45) further added 86 with her skipper.\n\nBut New Zealand lost their last seven wickets for a mere 44 runs as Mlaba dismissed Devine in an incisive spell.\n\nDevine hit nine boundaries.\n\nScoreboard\n\nNEW ZEALAND:\n\nS.
