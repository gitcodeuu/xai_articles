That was always the plan,” Aminul added.\n\n“But when I started small initiatives... and began to see successes, I couldn’t let go of that passion, and I have stayed on to serve my country further in this goal.”\n\nCricket and politics go hand-in-hand in Bangla­desh and the sport has been hit by the turmoil that has wracked the country.\n\nFormer prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in August 2024, fleeing by helicopter as crowds stormed her palace.\n\nFaruque Ahmed initially took up the post as BCB president after the resignation of Nazmul Hassan, a close ally of Hasina, but it was later handed to Aminul.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 7th, 2025",
