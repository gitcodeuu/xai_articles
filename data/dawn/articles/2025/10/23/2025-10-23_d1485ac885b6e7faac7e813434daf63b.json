  "content": "Kenya’s women’s marathon world record-holder Ruth Chepngetich was banned for three years on Thursday after she admitted to anti-doping rule violations but her 2:09:56 mark will remain on the books as it was set before her positive test.\n\nChepngetich, who smashed the record in Chicago last October, was provisionally suspended in July this year by the Athletics Integrity Unit after Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) was detected in a sample collected from the athlete on March 14.\n\nThe sample revealed an HCTZ concentration of 3,800ng/mL, far above the World Anti-Doping Agency’s minimum reporting limit of 20ng/mL.\n\nChepngetich, 31, initially denied any wrongdoing and could not explain the positive result despite an AIU investigation, which included analysis of her medications, supplements and phone data.\n\nHowever, on July 31, two weeks after Chepngetich was suspended, she changed her explanation, saying she had unknowingly taken her housemaid’s medication, which contained HCTZ, while ill.\n\n“She stated that she had forgotten to disclose this incident to the AIU investigators,” the AIU said in a statement.\n\nHCTZ is used clinically to treat fluid retention and hypertension, with the AIU adding that diuretics may be abused to mask the presence in urine of other prohibited substances.\n\nThe AIU said Chepngetich’s actions were reckless and indirectly intentional rather than accidental, initially applying a four-year sanction.\n\nHowever, Chepngetich’s early admission earned her a one-year reduction, resulting in a three-year ban issued on September 10.\n\n“The case regarding the positive test for HCTZ has been resolved but the AIU will continue to investigate the suspicious material recovered from Chepngetich’s phone to determine if any other violations have occurred,” AIU head Brett Clothier said.\n\n“In the meantime, all Chepngetich’s achievements and records pre-dating the 14 March 2025 sample stand.”\n\nIn April, Chepngetich had withdrawn from the London Marathon , saying she was “not in the right place mentally or physically” to run her best, but she had actually opted for a voluntary provisional suspension at the time.\n\nMarathon running has been hit with a spate of high-profile doping cases in recent years, particularly from Kenya which is world renowned for its middle and long-distance runners.\n\nIn November 2022, the middle and long-distance running powerhouse avoided a ban despite an increasing number of its athletes being suspended for positive tests.\n\nAthletics Kenya had said its government pledged $5 million per year for five years to fight doping in athletics.\n\nIn February 2024, Kenya’s Sarah Chepchirchir was hit with an eight-year ban after the former Tokyo Marathon winner was found to have violated anti-doping regulations for a second time when she returned an adverse analytical finding for testosterone.\n\nEarlier this year, Kenyan marathon runner Brimin Kipkorir — who won the Sydney Marathon in 2024 in a course record time — was also provisionally suspended by the AIU after he tested positive for prohibited substances.",
