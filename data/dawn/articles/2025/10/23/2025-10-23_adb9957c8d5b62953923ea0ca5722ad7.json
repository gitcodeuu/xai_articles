They said the operation had reduced threats to security forces and civilians in the vicinity.\n\nIn a separate action, the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) conducted an operation in Sibi after a tip-off about the presence of members of a banned outfit.\n\nCTD personnel surrounded a compound where the suspects were holed up. The militants opened fire and a firefight lasting more than an hour ensued, leaving five suspects dead, CTD sources said.\n\nArms, ammunition, maps and documents allegedly detailing attack plans were recovered from the site. Officials said the slain men were linked to past attacks on security forces, police and Levies personnel. All five bodies were shifted to a hospital.\n\nMeanwhile in Noshki, two police constables were gunned down by unidentified attackers on Wednesday.\n\nPolice said Abdul Razzaq and Obaid Ullah were travelling to police lines when assailants on motorbikes opened fire near the Gharibabad western bypass.\n\n“Both constables sustained multiple bullet wounds and [were martyred] on the spot,” said Noshki SHO Zahoor Baloch.\n\nPolice moved the bodies to the district hospital and started an investigation. No group had claimed responsibility by late Wednesday.\n\nIn another incident in Kachhi district’s Sanni Shoran area, a security man lost his life when a landmine planted beside a road exploded as a patrol vehicle passed. Police said the blast also badly damaged the vehicle.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 23rd, 2025",
