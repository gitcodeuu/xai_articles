He added that many growers have been hit hard by rising costs, making the relief measures necessary, and reiterated that the Sindh government’s focus remains on steady agricultural growth and economic stability.\n\nFlanked by provincial ministers Sharjeel Memon, Sardar Muhammad Bux Mahar, and Makhdoom Mahboobuz Zaman, the chief minister said the package is intended to guarantee timely fertiliser delivery, ensure transparent procurement, and provide prompt payments to farmers, all aimed at encouraging wheat cultivation and promoting food security and self-sufficiency.\n\nHe said wheat procurement is vital for stabilising the market and protecting growers from exploitative middlemen. “A support price assures farmers that their hard work is valued,” he added.\n\nSpeaking about the challenges posed by the federal government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) constraints, CM Shah said initial reluctance had been overcome due to the efforts of PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari. Federal approval was eventually secured after consultations with the IMF. “This achievement reflects the importance of coordinated negotiation, especially amid fiscal limitations,” he added.\n\nMr Shah pointed to Sindh’s successful wheat procurement drive in 2023–24, which helped stabilise the market, prevented shortages, kept flour prices from rising sharply, and conserved foreign exchange reserves.\n\nHe said that the Sindh government had recommended a minimum support price of Rs4,000, reflecting increased production costs, but accepted the lower federal rate of Rs3,500 in order to expedite relief for farmers.\n\nHe said that the allocation allowed the Sindh government to procure up to 800,000 to 1.2m tonnes this season, with district administrations mobilised for timely and transparent operations.\n\nThe chief minister credited Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari with securing the federal government’s commitment to support Sindh’s policy decisions, including maintaining a fair minimum price, revising agricultural taxation, shelving the proposed triple tax, and reverting to the earlier 15 per cent tax rate.\n\nHe acknowledged that issues such as fertiliser shortages had affected yields and said these are being addressed through direct provincial support.\n\nThe chief minister assured that the food and agriculture departments are working in close coordination to ensure effective distribution and procurement. He emphasised the government’s continued focus on supporting agriculture, maintaining public order, and promoting citizen welfare.\n\nLaw and order situation\n\nResponding to questions from reporters, the chief minister said the government is committed to maintaining peace in both urban and rural Sindh. “There are two major challenges: dacoits in rural areas and street crimes in urban centres,” he said, adding that some sectarian incidents had also occurred in cities, but the provincial government is addressing them firmly.\n\nHe added that the provincial government is strengthening the police force through improved training, upgraded technology, and better coordination. “The police are being equipped and modernised to handle these threats more effectively,” he said.\n\nAfghan repatriation policy\n\nIn response to a question about the federal government’s decision regarding Afghan nationals, the chief minister said, “There is now a national consensus that all Afghan refugees will return to their country.”\n\nHe confirmed that Sindh would fully comply with the federal policy, ensuring the repatriation process remains peaceful and lawful.\n\nWhen asked about the ban imposed by the Punjab government on the movement of certified seed, the chief minister said he had directed the Sindh chief secretary to speak with his Punjab counterpart to resolve the matter.\n\nRegarding the dengue outbreak, Mr Shah said the provincial health department had been mobilised to contain the situation, and local bodies had been instructed to increase mosquito-repellent spraying in Karachi and other districts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 23rd, 2025",
