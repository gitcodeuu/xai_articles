  "content": "Border closures between Pakistan and Afghanistan have pushed up prices of essential goods in both nations, with tomatoes now costing five times more in Pakistan since fighting broke out between the two neighbours this month.\n\nBorder crossings between the two countries have remained closed since October 11, following ground fighting and Pakistani airstrikes across their 2,600-km frontier that killed dozens on both sides in the worst fighting since the Taliban’s 2021 takeover of Kabul.\n\nAll trade and transit have been blocked since the fighting erupted, Khan Jan Alokozay, the head of the Pak-Afghan Chamber of Commerce in Kabul, told Reuters on Thursday.Advertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayLoaded: 0.00%00:00Remaining Time -10:03UnmuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Apples, which mostly come from Afghanistan, are also seeing a price surge.\n\n“We have around 500 containers of vegetables for export daily, all of which have spoiled,” said Alokozay.\n\nAround 5,000 containers of goods are stranded on both sides of the border, said a Pakistani official at the main Torkham border crossing in northwest Pakistan.\n\nHe said there was already a shortage of tomatoes, apples and grapes in the market. Pakistan’s commerce ministry did not respond to a request for a comment.\n\nThe border clashes were triggered after Islamabad demanded that Kabul control militants who attack Pakistan across their shared border, saying they operated from havens in Afghanistan. The Taliban has denied the charge.\n\nA ceasefire was agreed in talks hosted by Qatar and Turkey last weekend and is holding between the two sides, but the border trade remains closed. The next round of negotiations is scheduled for October 25 in Istanbul.",
