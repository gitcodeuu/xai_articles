As many as 166 (77 pc of 216) MNAs skipped the House proceedings without any formal leave application in advance.\n\nAmong the cabinet members, four federal ministers and one state minister attended all the sittings. The PM did not attend any sitting, while the office of the Leader of the Opposition remained vacant during the session.\n\nAttendance patterns by sitting\n\nAs in previous sessions, female members generally had higher attendance than their male counterparts. The second sitting saw the highest attendance, with 200 members (61pc of the current membership) present.\n\nThis session was a Private Members’ Day, during which the minister for housing and works moved motion 288 to suspend the agenda to discuss the country’s flood situation under motion 259, which had been previously introduced by the minister for parliamentary affairs in the first sitting. The lowest attendance occurred during the third (last) sitting, with only 159 members (49pc ) present. An analysis of attendance records and leave applications announced during the proceedings shows that 216 members (66pc of the current strength) missed at least one sitting during the session. However, only 50 members (23pc of those absent) submitted applications seeking leave from the House for their absence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 23rd, 2025",
