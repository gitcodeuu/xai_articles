He referred to recent reports about the withdrawal of security from Lahore’s Bilawal House, which was denied by the provincial government. “If someone reported that security was removed from Bilawal House in Lahore, they (PMLN) denied it in the media and did not contact us,” he rued.\n\nAbout the flood relief plan that stirred differences between the two parties, Mr Murtaza clarified that the PPP had given the government an “immediate relief plan” on the flood issue and suggested that the data of the Benazir Income Support Program be used for the purpose, but there was an uproar by the PML-N government over this suggestion.\n\nHe claimed the Punjab CM was provided inaccurate statistics regarding the floods and subsequent losses. “Farmers needed urgent money; for this, we asked you (PMLN) to use the BISP data and provide immediate assistance to the growers so that they could meet their needs,” he added.\n\nMr Murtaza said the PPP did not want to derail the system, adding that at least the spokespersons of the Punjab government should reconsider their choice of words.\n\nThe PPP leader also complained that research centres were not providing seeds to the farmers. “What will a poor farmer do with the limited compensation amount of Rs5,000 per acre when a bag of DAP fertiliser is available for Rs15,000,” he added.\n\nHe also reiterated reservations against the local government law. He said the PPP expressed reservations on the legislation as the law was “questionable”. However, the PPP will participate in the polls, he added. “We have serious reservations about the legislation, as non-party-based elections are the beginning of pre-poll rigging,” he said, adding that the PPP would soon present its strategy regarding the local bodies act. “Even if our concerns are not addressed, we will not leave the field open. The PPP will actively participate in the upcoming local government elections,” he said.\n\nIt may be noted that the Election Commission of Pakistan on Oct 21 asked the Punjab government to formulate the delimitation rules within four months in light of the new law, as it withdrew an earlier order under which polls could have been held by the end of this year.\n\nThe PML-N, however, took exception to the press conference by Mr Murtaza, particularly the criticism of the agri policies and the local government act. Punjab Minister for Information and Culture Azma Bokhari asked the PPP to take notice of Hassan Murtaza’s remarks; otherwise, the PML-N would be compelled to respond to him.\n\n“Whether Murtaza is conspiring against his own leadership… If anyone owes an apology, it should be to Asif Ali Zardari and Bilawal Bhutto, who could not even keep such defeated elements under control,” she quipped. Ms Bokhari said the PPP never missed a chance to malign the PML-N leadership.\n\nAfter months of broadsides, the acrimony between the PPP and the PML-N came to an apparent end following meetings between the top leaders, including PPP chief Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. The PM even agreed to use BISP for flood relief, while the PPP central executive committee decided to give its ally one month’s time to make good on the ‘unfulfilled’ promises.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 23rd, 2025",
