  "content": "QUETTA: Tensions flared in the Balochistan Assembly on Wednesday when ruling coalition partners, the Pakistan Peoples Party and the Pakistan Muslim League-N, criticised each other’s role in province and centre, warning that a lack of cooperation could collapse their respective administrations.\n\nThe open discord erupted over accusations from the PPP that the federal government, led by the PML-N, was neglecting Baloch­istan’s development and not fulfilling promises made to the provincial government. The PML-N levelled its own allegations in response.\n\nSenior Minister Mir Sadiq Umrani of the PPP issued a stark warning to the federal government, threatening that if his party withdrew its support, the federal coalition could fall “within a minute”.Advertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayLoaded: 0%Remaining Time -0:00MuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Criticising each other publicly is wrong. If PML-N withdraws, your government will not survive,” he said.\n\nThe heated exchange began soon after the session started, presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai.\n\nOpposition leader Mir Younas Aziz Zehri highlighted delays in the Karachi-Quetta-Chaman highway project, launched by PM Shehbaz Sharif three years ago, but still remains unfinished.\n\nHe criticised the construction company’s performance, citing deterioration of the old road. The speaker called for NHA officials and the contractor to appear before the assembly next week.\n\nProvincial Minister Mir Saleem Khosa assured that work would speed up as conditions improve, emphasising the prime minister’s commitment to Balochistan’s development.\n\nOther parties also voiced frustration with the federal government. JUI-F’s Molvi Noorullah criticised the allocation of only Rs560 million out of a required Rs56 billion for the Quetta-Zhob CPEC road project, calling it “a joke”. He said the Centre only exploits Balochistan’s re­­sources while ignoring its development.\n\nJUI-F member Shahida Rauf criticised both coalition partners for their infighting. “We should look at our own weaknesses before blaming the Centre. The House functions properly only when the chief minister is present,” she said, also highlighting the poor condition of Quetta’s roads.\n\nDuring the session, members condemned an armed attack on Parliamen­tary Secretary Barkat Rind’s home. Mr Rind asked attackers to face him directly,  and not target his family.\n\nIn another matter, JUI-F MPA Mir Zabid Ali Reki raised concerns over a Baloch youth’s dismissal only after a week of employment at the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Speaker promised to address this with authorities.\n\nMPA Dr Ashok Kumar claimed neglect of Balochistan’s Chris­tian community and sought an inquiry into minority funds.\n\nDepsite tensions, Mr Khosa defended the federal government’s record and em­­phasised party unity, highlighting development projects’ funding. He noted PML-N’s consistent support for PPP and their ongoing joint effort for Balochistan’s rights.\n\nLater, the House resumed regular business, and Revenue Minister Asim Kurd Gello presented the Agha Khan Properties Inheritance Bill, referring it to the standing committee. The session was adjourned until 3pm on Oct 24.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 23rd, 2025",
