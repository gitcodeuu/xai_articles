They emphasised that emotional and physical maturity are equally essential for building a strong and healthy Ummah.\n\nAmal Basha from Yemen, Andi Nur Faizah from Indonesia, Prof. Aziz Mechout from Morocco, Badar bin Salim bin Hamadan from Oman, Balarabe A. Haruna from Nigeria, and Saimum Reza Talukder from Bangladesh participated.\n\nEight members of the Punjab Assembly — Uzma Kardar, Rushda Lodhi, Safia Saeed, Ms Fatima, Ms Nasreen, Ms Mumtaz Sumbal Maalik Hussain, and former MPA Shameela Aslam — joined voices in advocating to raise the minimum age of marriage for girls to 18 years across Pakistan. They stressed that protecting vulnerable girls from early marriages is in line with Islamic principles of justice, gender equality and well-being.\n\nImam of Badshahi Mosque, Qari Muhammad Anis, also attended the consultation and extended his support to the cause, reaffirming that safeguarding girls’ rights is a moral and religious responsibility.\n\nThe participants further encouraged governments and religious authorities in Muslim countries to work collaboratively to harmonise laws that reflect both Islamic jurisprudence and contemporary social realities.\n\nThe session concluded with a joint commitment to continue dialogue, conduct comparative legal research and pursue coordinated policy actions among Muslim countries.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 30th, 2025",
