However, he has never disowned the messages shared from his X account.\n\n“The continued delay in issuing notifications for Mahmood Khan Achakzai and Allama Raja Nasir Abbas as Leaders of the Opposition is deeply concerning,” the post said. “I demand that they be immediately notified as Leaders of the Opposition in the Senate and the National Assembly, respectively.”\n\nThe post also praised recent political rallies and urged followers to continue their efforts.\n\nPTI leaders meet Fazl, seek his support for election to Senate seat\n\nThe post noted that the large turnouts at rallies in Charsadda, Khyber, and Karak demonstrate rising public awareness and a commitment to protecting rights. It also expressed appreciation to the organisers for their successful public outreach efforts.\n\nThe message instructed that PTI, in collaboration with the Tehreek Tahaffuz-i-Aaeen-i-Pakistan movement, “must now accelerate the struggle for true freedom.”\n\nThe former prime minister also addres­­sed internal party matters, clarifying communication protocols and leadership roles.\n\n“To avoid any confusion or miscommunication, all instructions and correspondence concerning the party matters shall be conveyed solely through the Secretary General Salman Akram Raja,” the post stated.\n\nIt also affirmed his support for two party members, saying, “Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz are my long-standing and loyal companions. … I have not issued any orders for their removal.”\n\nSeparately, Mr Khan’s party condemned Israel’s recent airstrikes in Gaza.\n\nPTI Central Secretary Information Sheikh Waqas Akram called on the international community, particularly the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, “to take immediate, decisive, and collective action to halt Israel’s aggression”.\n\nThe PTI also criticised the Adiala Jail administration for ignoring a court order regarding visitation rights for Khan. Mr Akram reported that despite clear instructions from the Islamabad High Court, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Mohammad Sohail Afridi and others were denied access.  He urged the IHC to take decisive action against those violating its orders and to restore Imran Khan’s right to meet his family, legal team, and political associates.\n\nPTI meets JUI-F leader\n\nMeanwhile, a PTI delegation visited the residence of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (JUI-F) leader Maulana Fazlur Rehman in Islamabad.\n\nPTI leader Asad Qaiser, speaking to Dawn, said he proposed holding a national jirga to address security concerns in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n“Maulana Fazlur Rehman assured support for the proposal,” Mr Qaiser said.\n\nThe PTI delegation also advocated for uniting opposition parties in Parliament and reached a consensus to nominate Mahmood Khan Achakzai as the opposition leader. They also requested the JUI-F’s support for a vacant Senate seat from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 30th, 2025",
