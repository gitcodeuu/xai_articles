Pakistan and Central Asia must bargain collectively, build regional consensus, and move forward together in this defining decade,” she stressed.\n\nShe said climate justice and domestic climate governance must be viewed separately. “The world must not ask the most climate-vulnerable nations to carry the burden of others’ emissions,” she said, adding, “Anger at inaction at home should not stop the search for climate justice globally, shared responsibility is the essence of climate politics.”\n\nHighlighting global inequities, she noted that fossil fuels continued to receive $7 trillion in annual subsidies despite record growth in renewables. “The world is adding renewables but not replacing fossil fuels,” she warned. “This dual expansion is pushing frontline countries like Pakistan, where temperatures reach 53 degrees centigrade, to the brink.”\n\nShe reminded that Pakistan contributed less than one per cent to global emissions yet suffered disproportionately from climate disasters. Referring to the International Energy Agency’s estimate of $4.5 trillion needed annually for clean energy by 2030, she said developing nations faced high capital costs, fragmented institutions, and limited de-risking tools.\n\n“Climate finance is not charity, it is justice,” she asserted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 30th, 2025",
