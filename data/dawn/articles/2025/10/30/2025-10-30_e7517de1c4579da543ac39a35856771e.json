If India were truly to cut off or significantly reduce Indus flows, Pakistan’s densely populated plains would face severe water shortages, especially in winter and dry seasons. Indeed, about 80 per cent of Pakistan’s irrigated agriculture depends on Indus basin rivers,” the report reads.\n\nThe report says that following the signing of the defence treaty betw­een Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, the kingdom will most likely support Isl­­amabad in any conflict with India.\n\n“This is likely to be supportive of the continuation of the Indus agreement as India is more likely to think carefully before creating a pretext for war.”\n\nIf the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) unravels, the involvement of other players like China or even Afgha­n­is­­tan can further complicate matters.\n\n“For now, the IWT remains officially bilateral, but the 2025 episode showed that global powers have a stake in preventing water conflicts,” warns the report.\n\nInternationally, India’s suspension of the IWT raised concerns about setting a precedent.\n\nChina, a close ally of Pakistan and an upstream riparian, also took interest in the affair.\n\nIn May this year, China’s state media announced an acceleration of the Mohmand Dam project in Pakistan — a hydropower initiative financed by Beijing — framing it as a gesture of support to Islamabad in the face of India’s water “threats”.\n\nThe implication was clear: China signalled solidarity with Pakistan, effectively cautioning India against pushing Islamabad too far on water.\n\nFor the first time, India began operating its dams outside the treaty constraints.\n\n‘Reservoir flushing’\n\nIn May, Indian authorities carried out “reservoir flushing” on the Chenab River’s Salal and Baglihar dams without notifying Pakistan.\n\nThis operation, which involves emptying reservoirs to flush out silt, had been forbidden under the treaty (or at least tightly regulated) because it causes sudden downstream flow changes.\n\nIndia proceeded unilaterally, aiming to boost its dams’ storage and power generation capacity now that it considered itself unbound by IWT limits.\n\nThe immediate impact was dramatic: sections of the Chenab in Pakistan’s Punjab ran dry for a few days, as India’s dam gates were shut, then released sediment-laden torrents when opened.\n\nThe IWT between India and Pakistan has acted as a core conflict resolution tool and point of cooperation for 60 years.\n\nIndia’s suspension of the treaty this year marks a period of heighten­­ed tension between the two countries.\n\nThere was no armed conflict over water in these instances. In fact, the IWT often served as a safety valve, providing legal and diplomatic processes to address grievances that might otherwise provoke unilateral retaliation.\n\n“However, these arbitrated conflicts have accumulated over time to reduce trust even as cooperation continued,” the IEP says in its report.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 31st, 2025",
