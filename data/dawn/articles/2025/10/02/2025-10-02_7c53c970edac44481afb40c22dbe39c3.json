The coalition comprises heads of over 50 academic institutes in Clifton, DHA, Saddar, and other areas, as well as police officials.\n\nIt was also decided in the meeting that random blood tests to check for drug abuse among students would be carried out with the consent of their parents.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after the meeting, South DIG Syed Asad Raza said that the Campus Security and Substance Abuse Watch Force had been established with 50 personnel including women officers, who would be deployed at different institutes.\n\nHe said their uniforms were designed in consultation with the institutes so that their presence would not be domineering, but rather cooperative.\n\nHe said the police had consulted with around 150 schools, colleges and universities located in South-Zone to grasp the issue of drug abuse, share responsibilities and devise strategies to tackle the problem.\n\nHe said as part of a larger strategy against narcotics, the police were focusing on shisha bars, social media platforms, and courier services, which were allegedly involved in the supply of drugs.\n\nEarlier, during the consultative meeting, singer-turned-activist Shehzad Roy suggested that students involved in drug abuse should be treated as victims, not as criminals.\n\nSadia Faisal of Karachi Grammar School proposed that an age-appropriate curriculum should be devised at the institutes.\n\nMeanwhile, a statement issued after the meeting said that presence of the new campus force could deter substance abuse. “Collaborative working between police and institution administrators will help in developing strategies for addressing substance misuse.”\n\nThe participants of the meeting also decided to develop a curriculum that educates students about the risks and consequences of substance abuse, including its physical and mental health effects.\n\nThe special curriculum would also incorporate life skills training to help students resist peer pressure, make informed decisions, and manage stress, it was stated. Awareness campaigns, workshops, and seminars would be organised to educate students, teachers, and parents about substance misuse.\n\nRegarding parents’ awareness and consent for testing, it was decided that parents would be educated about the risks of substance misuse and the importance of regular testing.\n\nThe parents’ consent would be obtained for random drug testing, ensuring that the parents were involved in the process. “Support and resources would be provided to parents to address substance misuse issues with their children.”\n\nAbout random blood testing for drug abuse on the campus, the participants agreed that random drug testing could deter students from substance misuse. “The students would be identified who may be struggling with substance misuse and will be provided with support and resources.”\n\nBesides, it was also decided that teachers would be trained to identify signs of substance misuse among students.\n\nThe signs include changes in behaviour and physical symptoms.\n\nThey would be equipped with skills to support students who may be struggling with drug abuse and refer them to appropriate resources. The teachers would also be provided with strategies to manage classrooms effectively and promote a positive learning environment.\n\nMoreover, the heads of academic institutes and the police officers agreed that “behavioural changes in students would be monitored”.\n\n“Students should be considered victims, rather than perpetrators,” the participants said.\n\nStudents’ behaviour, attendance, academic performance, and social interactions would be monitored. “Frequent collaboration between law enforcement, educators, and administrators would be ensured to develop effective strategies and action plan for addressing substance misuse,” declared the participants.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 2nd, 2025",
