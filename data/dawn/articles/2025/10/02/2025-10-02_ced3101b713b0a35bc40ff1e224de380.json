On her way back, she was allegedly intercepted by two armed suspects belonging to her village, riding a motorcycle.\n\nVictim says she was trafficked to a village in Umerkot district of Sindh for prostitution\n\nThe suspects allegedly abducted the girl and took her to an abandoned house, where she was locked in a room and was repeatedly raped by both men.\n\n‘Z’ told police that the two suspects then drugged her and she fell unconscious. She says that when she regained consciousness, she found herself in a car going on a highway.\n\nShe says that she was again rendered unconscious with a chemical-soaked cloth by the suspects and eventually transported to Dhagri village in Umerkot, Sindh, where she was handed over to a suspect, ‘G’, who told her that she had been sold for Rs200,000 by her two abductors/rapists.\n\nShe says that ‘G’ ran a brothel and forced her into prostitution.
