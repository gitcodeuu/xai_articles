He said the administration would arrange transport up to the Torkham border for those willing to return, but warned that the government could resort to the use of force if the refugees refused to leave. He, however, expressed the hope that such a stage would not come. Mr Safi also asked refugees having outstanding loans to share details with his office, assuring them that assistance would be provided.\n\nFollowing the federal government’s directive, the three camps located in Samarbagh, Chakdara and Timer have been formally closed, and the district administration has expedited measures for the refugees’ return. The Lower Dir Afghan refugees’ district administrator, Humayun Khan, has instructed that equipment and assets from health centres and schools inside the camps be handed over to the relevant departments. Talking to local journalists at Timergara, he said that currently, more than 40,000 Afghan refugees, comprising 4,500 families, reside in the camps and in rented houses across Lower Dir. So far, 565 individuals belonging to 100 families have voluntarily repatriated, while the local administration has sought funds from the provincial government for transport arrangements up to Torkham.\n\nAccording to official data, 33,681 refugees in Lower Dir possess proof of registration cards, while another 6,100 hold Afghan citizen cards. In Upper Dir, the number of Afghan refugees exceeds 3,000. Under the UNHCR-assisted repatriation scheme, returning PoR cardholders receive USD 155 per family and USD 35 per individual. After the camps are vacated, privately owned land will be handed back to its owners, while government land will be given into state possession.\n\nRefugee elders in the meeting demanded transport, issuance of educational documents for students, continuation of humanitarian assistance and help in settling outstanding loans. The AC assured them that their concerns would be conveyed to higher authorities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nPAK AFGHAN TIES\nPAKISTAN\n0\nRead more\nPunjab launches third phase of deporting Afghans\nPakistan starts deporting registered Afghan refugees: UNHCR\n110,000 refugees in Pakistan have high-risk profiles: UNHCR\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
