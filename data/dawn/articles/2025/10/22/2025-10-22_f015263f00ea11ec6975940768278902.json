But Putin has been unwilling to consider concessions. Moscow has long demanded that Ukraine agree to cede more territory before any ceasefire.\n\nTrump, who last week spoke by pho­­ne to Putin and met Ukrainian Presi­dent Volodymyr Zelensky, had hoped for another high-profile session with the Russian leader after their August summit in Alaska failed to advance negotiations.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke by telephone on Monday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, after Trump said that the two top diplomats would be meeting this week to arrange a Budapest summit.\n\n“An additional in-person meeting between the secretary and foreign minister is not necessary, and there are no plans for President Trump to meet with President Putin in the immediate future,” a Trump administration official said on condition of anonymity. The official nonetheless termed the call between Rubio and Lavrov “productive”.\n\n‘No clear date’\n\nThe Kremlin said there was no clear date and that “serious preparation” for a summit was needed and that may take time. “Listen, we have an understanding of the presidents, but we cannot postpone what has not been finalised,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\n“Neither President Trump nor Pre­sident Putin gave exact dates.” Asked if Moscow had an understanding of a possible date for the summit, Peskov said: “No, there is no understanding.”\n\nPutin spoke by telephone on Thursday with Trump, who met the following day with the Ukrainian president to discuss providing US-made Tomahawk missiles that could penetrate deep into Russia.\n\nTrump hailed the call as progress and quickly posted on social media that he would meet within two weeks with Putin in Budapest.\n\nIt marked the latest abrupt shift by Trump, who in August welcomed Put­in to Alaska — his first time on Wes­tern soil since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\n‘Lack of decision on Tomahawks’\n\nThe Ukrainian president, in his ni­­ghtly address, said Russia “almost au­­tomatically became less interested in diplomacy” due to the postponement of a decision by the US administration on Tomahawk missiles for Ukraine.\n\nZelensky said he and had agreed that a starting point for talks would be with the two sides at their current positions on the battlefield.\n\n“Instead, Russia is once again doing everything it can to abandon diplomacy,” Zelensky said.\n\n“The greater the Ukrainian long-range capability, the greater the Russian willingness to end the war. These past few weeks have confirmed this once again,” Zelensky said.\n\nThe Tomahawks, he said, had become “a strong investment in diplomacy” and Ukraine would hold further discussions on long-range weapons with its European and US allies.\n\nEuropean leaders called on Washington on Tuesday to hold firm in demanding an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine, with present battle lines to serve as the basis for any future talks.\n\nIn a statement, the leaders of Bri­tain, France, Germany and the EU said they “strongly support Presi­d­e­nt’s position that the fighting should stop immediately, and that the curre­­nt line of contact should be the starting point of negotiations”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nRUSSIA UKRAINE WAR\nNEWSPAPER\n   \n0\nRead more\nTrump says he does not think Ukraine will win war\nTrump pours cold water on Kyiv’s hopes for Tomahawks\nTrump says he will meet Putin again after making progress in Ukraine talks\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
