Trump is also expected to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nSouth Korea detected several projectiles believed to be short-range ballistic missiles fired from an area near North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang, in a northeasterly direction early on Wednesday, its Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement.\n\nTrump to visit South Korea\n\nLee and Trump have discussed the idea of trying to meet North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when the American president visits the South, but Pyongyang has not publicly responded to the idea.\n\nUS officials considered, but never confirmed, a trip to the demilitarised zone (DMZ) separating the two Koreas, according to a person familiar with the discussions.\n\nSouth Korea has suspended tours of the Joint Security Area (JSA) at the inter-Korean border village of Panmunjom until early November, but has not confirmed any plans for a meeting with Kim.\n\nTrump and Kim held three summits during Trump’s 2017 to 2021 first term and exchanged a number of letters that Trump called “beautiful“, before the unprecedented diplomatic effort broke down over US demands that Kim give up his nuclear weapons.\n\nIn September, Kim expressed “fond memories” of Trump saying there was no reason to avoid talks with the US if Washington stopped insisting his country give up nuclear weapons, but he would never abandon the nuclear arsenal to end sanctions.\n\n“It is not at all inconceivable that Donald Trump could here in Washington, DC, say ‘Denuclearisation, that’s our goal, that’s our policy’ and then go up to Panmunjom and say, ‘Oh, you know, Kim Jong Un is a nuclear power’,” said Victor Cha, with the Centre for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n“Even if it’s a short meeting, in the broader scheme of things, with all that the United States has to deal with these days, it wouldn’t necessarily be a bad thing.”\n\nAndrew Yeo, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said while a Trump-Kim meeting was not impossible, the US president’s known schedule and timing might make it unlikely.\n\n“Trump’s only there for one night, two days, and because of the Xi-Trump meeting, that’s probably taking up all the bandwidth or resources of the US government,” he said.\n\nMultiple missiles launched\n\nNuclear-armed North Korea has steadily upgraded its missile capabilities over the past decade, defying multiple United Nations sanctions, having test-launched long-range ballistic missiles with potential ranges to strike the US mainland if fired at a trajectory calibrated for that purpose.\n\nSouth Korea’s military said it had detected movements ahead of the launch, then tracked the projectiles after they were fired and flew about 350 km (217 miles), the military said.\n\nThe missiles appeared to have fallen inland, a military official separately said.\n\nJapan’s new Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said there was no impact on Japan’s security from the North Korean missile launch and Tokyo was sharing real-time information with the US.\n\nNorth Korea last launched ballistic missiles on May 8 when it fired multiple short-range missiles from its east coast.\n\nNorth Korea showcased its latest intercontinental ballistic missile this month at a parade attended by the Chinese premier.\n\nWORLD\n0\nRead more\nNorth Korea test-fires two new air defence missiles\nChina denies conspiring with North Korea, Russia against US\nNorth Korea fires missiles after slamming US-South Korea drills\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
