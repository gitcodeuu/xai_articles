The court has also summoned the Women Medical Officer and Superintendent of Adiala Jail for the same date.\n\nThe bench is expected to address not only the issues surrounding visitation rights for the PTI founder but also the question of jurisdiction over Adiala Jail — a longstanding point of contention between the Islamabad and Punjab administrations.\n\nOn Monday, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir of the IHC overruled objections raised by the registrar’s office on Chief Minister Afridi’s petition seeking permission to meet Imran Khan in jail. Advocate Ali Bukhari appeared on behalf of the petitioner, while the plea was filed through Advocate General Shah Faisal.\n\nThe petition requested the court’s intervention to allow a meeting between the provincial chief executive and the PTI founder to discuss governance matters and cabinet formation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe registrar’s office had earlier objected, noting that similar petitions had already been decided and that a prescribed procedure existed for such visits. However, Advocate Bukhari argued that “fresh legal grounds” existed, since the cabinet had not yet been constituted and consultation with Mr Khan was essential for administrative functioning.\n\nJustice Tahir, after hearing the arguments, dismissed the objections and issued notices to the interior secretary, inspector general of police, and Superintendent Adiala Jail, directing them to submit their replies by October 23.\n\nEarlier, on March 25, a three-judge larger bench of the IHC — comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar, Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir, and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan — had reinstated the twice-a-week visitation schedule for Imran Khan, while barring visitors from issuing media statements after meetings.\n\nThe bench had ruled that only individuals approved by Mr Khan’s coordinator, Salman Akram Raja, could meet him on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and advised the PTI founder to approach the trial court for permission to speak to his children via telephone.\n\nThe IHC administration has now fixed the matter before the same bench to consolidate and hear all petitions concerning Mr Khan’s visitation rights and jail conditions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nIMRAN KHAN ARREST\nNEWSPAPER\n   \n0\nRead more\nIHC clears KP CM’s plea regarding meeting with Imran\nCentre asks Punjab to facilitate Imran–CM Afridi meeting for KP cabinet formation\nIHC restores Imran’s jail meetings twice a week\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
