They said that the meeting was attended by Health Secretary Shahidullah Khan, Director-General Health Services Dr Shahid Yunis and other senior officials, who briefed the chief minister about the dengue scenario and ongoing efforts to prevent the spread of the infection in the province.\n\nThey said that the chief minister strictly ordered that MNAs, MPAs and other elected representatives at the union council level should take part in the awareness drive to contain the disease after he was briefed that the situation regarding the mosquito-breeding was favourable in the province and the disease would remain around the corner till early days of November.\n\nThe meeting was convened on an emergency basis in view of the upswing in dengue cases since the start of the current month. Public health experts and officials associated with the anti-dengue campaign informed the participants of the meeting that the province had been home to the disease for the last 10 years. They said that the disease infects people every year because mosquitoes, the carriers and transmitters of the disease, are present, due to which the virus cannot be eliminated.\n\nTotal number of patients in KP reaches 3,792\n\n“In such a situation, the only option is to keep people safe from the virus. There is an intense need to inform people about causative agents of the disease,” officials said.\n\nThe elected representatives, the chief minister said, could play an active part in lessening the severity of the infection through awareness because people listened to their MPA, MNAs and councillors. Health officials said that people in endemic areas of the province should be asked to refrain from storage of water in open pots and eliminate stagnant water pools to deny breeding space to mosquitoes.\n\nThe chief minister directed health and other line departments to coordinate efforts and ensure that insecticidal spray was conducted as a top priority to eradicate mosquitoes and provide impregnated bed nets to people in hotspot areas. He said that there was no dearth of funds and asked the relevant authorities to procure the desired stuff to do away with mosquitoes and safeguard people.\n\nHealth officials on the occasion said that they had already allocated beds in every hospital, including medical teaching institutions, to provide better services to patients. “The virus will remain around the corner till next month; therefore, prevention is the better strategy,” they said.\n\nThe chief minister instructed authorities concerned to keep his office updated regarding the situation on a daily basis and pledged to monitor the situation.\n\nHe also issued instructions to the information department to engage the community for prevention, as the climate was suitable for the vector and education of people was very important, said officials, who attended the meeting.\n\nAccording to a report released by the Integrated Diseases Surveillance and Response System (IDSRS), 35 more patients checked into hospitals during the last 24 hours, bringing the number of currently admitted people due to dengue to 47. Since the start of the year, a total of 1,557 people have been hospitalised, while a total of 3,498 patients have recovered from the vector-borne sickness.\n\nThe disease has caused two deaths, both in Mardan, one of the high-risk districts, while the province has a total of 292 active cases, including 71 in Peshawar, 30 in Mardan, 21 in Haripur, 20 in Dir Lower, 14 each in Malakand and Hangu, 12 in Swabi, 10 in Bajaur and nine each in Lakki Marwat and Charsadda.\n\nThe three-page IDSRS’s report noted that Charsadda was atop of the list with 1,044 patients, Peshawar 377, Mardan 343, Haripur 329, Mansehra 299, Kohat 156, Swabi 148, Abbottabad 131, Dir Lower 118, Malakand 105 and Hangu with 102 patients. “Except for a few, all districts are endemic and are recording cases,” it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nPAKISTAN\n0\nRead more\nProbe begins into two deaths as dengue cases soar to 3,638 in KP\nLab network to ensure prompt response to disease outbreaks\nSindh govt downplays dengue outbreak, confirms 276 new cases in October\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
