The Lahore Development Authority (LDA), the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa), the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA), the Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC) and the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) are jointly engaged in water sprinkling on city roads to reduce dust and pollutants in the air.\n\nThe recently-introduced ‘anti-smog guns’ are also operating in the highly-polluted city areas, while construction sites are being regularly sprayed with water to check dust.\n\nAs per environment department, 24-hour monitoring is being carried out to check emissions from brick kilns, industries and vehicles. At Lahore’s entry points, vehicle inspections and monitoring have also been increased.\n\nPunjab’s first modern ‘Smog Monitoring and Control Centre’ is now fully operational, collecting real-time data from across the province to enable immediate action, the department says.\n\nAccording to the centre, wind speeds between 3 and 6km/h will gradually help reduce pollution levels.\n\nAs per the centre, on Wednesday (today) Lahore’s average AQI is expected to remain between 210 and 240. Winds from Indian cities including Dharamshala, Ludhiana, Haryana, and Sri Ganganagar are likely to affect the air quality of Gujranwala, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Burewala, Bahawalpur, Rahim Yar Khan and Multan, it adds.\n\nThe Punjab government has advised people to wear masks during smog conditions, avoid unnecessary travel and limit outdoor exposure for children, elderly individuals and respiratory patients. Residents are also encouraged to increase indoor and outdoor greenery to help absorb pollutants.\n\nMs Aurangzeb says that Punjab government’s machinery is fully mobilised to mitigate smog and protect public health. “We are taking every possible step to safeguard our people from the harmful effects of smog,” she emphasises.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nAIR POLLUTION\nPAKISTAN\n0\nRead more\nLahore ranks second most polluted city in world in terms of air quality\nSmog to intensify across Punjab after ‘Indian fireworks’\nInter-departmental operation against air pollution paying dividends, claims Punjab govt\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
