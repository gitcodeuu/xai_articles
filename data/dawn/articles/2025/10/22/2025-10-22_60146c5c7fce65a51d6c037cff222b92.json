Standing across from him will be 28-year-old Rudra Pratap (12-2) whose record was built predominantly at bantamweight, making this a high-risk, high-reward gambit for both men.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nAccording to a press release from the Pakistan MMA Federation, the event is expected to be scouted by UFC officials, a detail that aligns perfectly with Rizwan’s ultimate ambition.\n\n“There is no Pakistani in the UFC,” Rizwan told Dawn earlier this year, “and I want to be the first.”\n\nThe high-stakes clash occurs as Pakistani MMA enjoys a powerful surge, with recent international victories from compatriots Shahab Ali, Abdul Manan and Ayyan Hussain in Georgia boosting the nation’s profile.\n\nA victory for “The Haider” would not only protect his pristine record but could potentially kick open the door to the sport’s biggest stage, carving his name as a pioneer in Pakistani combat sports history.\n\nPAK INDIA TIES\nSPORT\n   \n0\nRead more\nRizwan ‘The Haider’ eyes history, predicts knockout win in Lahore showdown\nRizwan edges Egypt’s Adham in split decision to cap Pakistan Open MMA\nPakistan’s sporting heroes get an unofficial safety net\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n \n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\n \nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\n \nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\n \nCan International Law Stop Wars?\n \nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\n \nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\n \nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\n \nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
