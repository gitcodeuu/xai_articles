Their core demand was that the MSP be set at a minimum of Rs4,000 per maund to cover the escalating production costs and ensure that farmers earned a reasonable profit.\n\nMr Tariq criticised the government’s previous “anti-farmer policy,” which he claimed was adopted last year under instructions from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nHe noted that keeping the support price low, despite rising input costs — including fertiliser, seeds, diesel, and agricultural labour — inflicted severe losses on farmers. This led to a 9 per cent reduction in wheat cultivation this year, a dangerous sign for the nation’s food security, he added.\n\n“The delay and apathy in determining the MSP is an admission of the failure of IMF-driven agricultural policies,” Tariq asserted. He warned that when agriculture is subjected to the logic of the market and profit, the heaviest burden falls on small and medium-sized farmers, who are already struggling with debt, inflation, and climate disasters.\n\nThe PKRC also demanded that the Sindh government immediately set the MSP for paddy (rice) at Rs4,000 per maund to protect millions of farmers in southern Punjab and Sindh from exploitation.\n\nWhile welcoming the government’s move, Tariq called it a temporary win that must be seen as only the first step towards fundamental agricultural policy reform. He described the decision as an “acknowledgement of the government’s policy defeat,” realising that further ignoring farmers’ demands would only deepen the food crisis.\n\nThe PKRC also welcomed the government’s concurrent announcement to lift all restrictions on the inter-provincial movement of wheat, calling it a positive development and an admission that previous restrictions and hoarding measures had failed politically.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nFollow Dawn Business on X, LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook for insights on business, finance and tech from Pakistan and across the world.\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nCentre sets new wheat support price at Rs3,500\nMinimum prices for major crops urged\nFarmers announce province-wide protests over wheat pricing\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
