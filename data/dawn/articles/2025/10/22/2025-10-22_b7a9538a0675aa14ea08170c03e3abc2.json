The number of female microfinance borrowers has more than tripled, while women’s portfolios in small and medium enterprise (SME) and agricultural financing have doubled since 2021.\n\nHe credited the SBP’s Banking on Equality policy — a gender-mainstreaming framework introduced in 2021 — for much of this progress. The policy aims to reduce barriers to women’s access to financial services.\n\nNumber of accounts rises to 37m, gender gap drops to 30pc\n\nHe added that banks have hired over 14,600 women in the past three years, contributing to institutional diversity alongside financial inclusion.\n\nThe central bank is now finalising the second phase of the Banking on Equality policy, which will focus on integrating digital solutions, business profiling, and remote financing channels to support women-led micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs).\n\nMr Ahmed said promoting gender equality and women’s entrepreneurship remains central to Pakistan’s inclusive economic growth agenda. The SBP has also adopted the WE-vFinance Code, a World Bank initiative developed in collaboration with international financial institutions and partner countries, aimed at closing gender gaps in MSME financing.\n\nTwenty-two banks have joined the initiative, which focuses on addressing data limitations and developing gender-responsive financial solutions.\n\nTo further promote women’s entrepreneurship, the governor called for consistent gender-inclusive strategies, supportive industry environments, and investment in capacity building for women.\n\nHe reaffirmed SBP’s commitment to advancing women’s participation in the economy through targeted policy measures.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nFollow Dawn Business on X, LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook for insights on business, finance and tech from Pakistan and across the world.\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nWomen’s empowerment emphasised for economic change\nPakistan sells First Women Bank to UAE firm\nSustainable growth key to long-term stability: State Bank governor\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
