It added that the new regulations “include a package of rights that guarantee the domestic worker a decent life and a stable work environment”.\n\nAccording to the guide, professions permitted by law in the domestic worker sector include “domestic worker, private driver, and specialised professions such as home nurse, cook, tailor, butler, supervisor, and house manager, as well as home guard, personal assistant, farmer, physical therapist, and home coffee maker”.\n\nThe guidelines also allow the addition of any other profession that may fall under the duties of domestic workers, the report added.\n\n“It is also stipulated that domestic workers shall be disbursed with their wages according to the unified contract signed with the employer,” Saudi Gazette said, adding that the new guidelines stress workers’ right to a weekly rest day agreed upon in the contract.\n\nThe provisions also include “daily rest hours of no less than eight continuous hours, in addition to a full month’s leave after completing two years of continuous work if the worker wishes to renew the work contract”.\n\nIn 2008, the Human Rights Watch called on Saudi Arabia to improve labour law protections and end its “sponsorship” system to prevent domestic workers from being treated like slaves.\n\nUnder the “sponsorship” system, also known as the “Kafala” system, foreigners in Saudi Arabia obtain a visa through their employer, who usually retains their passports.\n\nMore to follow\n\nWORLD\n0\nRead more\nHRW warns of migrant worker deaths in 2034 World Cup hosts Saudi Arabia\nSaudi legalises almost 800,000 Pakistani workers: ambassador\nTHE DEADLY GULF DREAM\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
