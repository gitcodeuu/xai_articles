The change is reportedly influenced by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which has urged Pakistan to liberalise foreign exchange operations.\n\nDespite a $110m current account surplus recorded in September, the broader economic picture remains challenging, with the trade deficit rising to $9bn in the first quarter. The government is also negotiating rollover of large debt repayments due in FY26.\n\nChina accounted for the largest share of profit repatriation, receiving $205.6m in Q1, up from $34.3m in the same period last year. However, Chinese investment declined sharply to $188m from $502.6m, reflecting reduced foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows from Beijing.\n\nChina tops profit outflows despite drop in investment\n\nProfit outflows to the UK totalled $162.2m, up slightly from $145.3m, while the United States received $68m compared to $56m. The Netherlands experienced a significant increase, receiving $92.3m compared to $6.7 million in the same period last year.\n\nBy sector, the power sector led repatriation with $186m, up from $50m, followed by the financial sector — mainly banks — at $182m, compared to $88m last year. The telecommunications sector repatriated $68m, up from $7.5m, while the food sector accounted for $62m, up from $42m.\n\nWith SBP reserves at $14.4bn and improved ties with the IMF, analysts expect continued relaxation in profit repatriation policies for the remainder of FY26.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nFollow Dawn Business on X, LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook for insights on business, finance and tech from Pakistan and across the world.\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nIMF says made ‘significant progress’ toward reaching staff-level agreement in talks with Pakistan\nRate cut unlikely this month, says SBP governor\nSBP, International Finance Corporation ink deal to boost local currency financing in Pakistan\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
