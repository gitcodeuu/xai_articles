Most are in the south and centre of the Strip.\n\n“The response has been really overwhelming,” Etefa said.\n\nShe said Palestinians were in “survival mode”, eating only some of the food received, and saving the rest as they are “extremely worried” that the ceasefire might collapse.\n\nEtefa said WFP trucks were only coming through the Kerem Shalom and Kissufim crossings, but called for every entry point into the Palestinian territory to be opened, particularly those in the north, where the food situation “is extremely dire”.\n\n“We don’t have an indication on when those border points will be open,” she added.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Neta­n­­­yahu said on Saturday the Rafah border crossing between Gaza and Egypt will remain closed until further notice, with its reopening dependent on Hamas handing over bodies of deceased hostages.\n\nVance rules out US troop deployment\n\nMeanwhile, US Vice President JD Vance, who arrived in in Israel on Tuesday, ruled out the possiblity of sending troops into Gaza, reiterating a pledge made by US President Donald Trump and US officials multiple times.\n\n“There are not going to be American boots on the ground in Gaza. The President of the United States has made that very clear. All of our military leadership has made that very clear,” Vance said at a press conference in Kiryat Gat, southern Israel, where a US-led mission is monitoring the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nVance added that the US would limit itself to providing “useful coordination”.\n\nHe also clarified that Washington had not set a deadline for the disarmament of Hamas. “We know that Hamas has to comply with the deal and if Hamas doesn’t comply with the deal, very bad things are going to happen, but I’m not going to do what the President of the United States has thus far refused to do, which is put an explicit deadline on it because a lot of this stuff is difficult.”\n\nVance, however, was upbeat about the prospects of the ceasefire holding, but said that its implementation would require “constant monitoring and supervision”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nGAZA INVASION\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nMediators scramble to salvage Gaza truce\nSustaining Gaza ceasefire ‘vital’ to deliver aid, save lives: UN’s World Food Programme\nGenocide 101: Starving Gaza\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
