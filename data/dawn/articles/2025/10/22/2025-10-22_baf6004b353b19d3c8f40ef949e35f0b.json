That is non-negotiable.”\n\nMr Naqvi expressed “immense respect” for religious leaders, scholars and clerics, emphasising that the government’s actions were not aimed at any particular sect or group but only at those challenging the writ of the state.\n\n“There was a perception being built on social media that the federal government is targeting a particular religious sect,” he said. “Such claims are completely false. We respect all our ulema, and this government has always stood by them. Pakistan was founded in the name of Islam, and our support for religious scholars and clerics remains firm. But anyone who comes armed will, under no circumstances, be allowed to operate.”\n\nNaqvi meets religious scholars, clerics to address reservations\n\nBefore arriving at the Governor’s House, Mr Naqvi, accompanied by Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon and Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, met prominent scholars and clerics at the residence of Mufti Muneebur Rehman.\n\nBoth sides agreed to convene a comprehensive meeting in Islamabad in the coming days to address key concerns raised by religious leaders. The scholars and clerics were assured that all legitimate and genuine issues presented by them would be addressed on a priority basis. A statement issued after the meeting said that a detailed discussion took place regarding “recent developments”, and the scholars expressed their viewpoints on various issues.\n\nMr Naqvi reiterated that the government remained committed to non-interference in the affairs of religious seminaries (madaris) and mosques.\n\n“The government will not interfere in the affairs of madaris and mosques,” the statement quoted him as saying.\n\nTo ensure continued engagement, it was also agreed that a dedicated focal person would be appointed to maintain constant communication and coordination between the government and religious leadership, the statement added.\n\nOther participants of the meeting included Allama Syed Muzaffar Shah, Mufti Abid Mubarak, Allama Liaqat Hussain Azhari, Allama Rehan Azhar Naumani, Mufti Rafiur Rehman Noorani, Allama Ashraf Gormani and Allama Ahmed Rabbani.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nPAKISTAN\n0\nRead more\nSummary for banning TLP forwarded to Centre, says Punjab minister\nPunjab seeks ban on TLP after violent protest\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
