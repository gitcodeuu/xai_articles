The premier, thereafter, seemed content that if things work out as planned, there would be no need to activate BISP in Punjab for this purpose.\n\nTalking to Dawn, senior PPP leader Syed Nayyar Hussain Bokhari, who was present in the meeting between the Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari-led delegation and PM Shehbaz, said that if the provincial government was providing a comprehensive rehabilitation package to the people, his party will have “no objections”.\n\nHowever, he wondered why the Punjab government had refused to provide funds through the BISP, when it had taken a share from the loans that the federal government received from donors and international lenders.\n\nWhen contacted, Federal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, who had also attended the PM-Bilawal meeting, told Dawn that the premier had made a promise to Mr Bhutto-Zardari regarding assistance to flood victims in Punjab.\n\nHowever, he added that on the very next day, another important meeting was held at PM House, which was attended by the chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan.\n\n“In that meeting, the Punjab CM assured the PM that she was going to launch a major programme for flood victims in the province and after that there will be no need to get additional funds from the BISP,” he elaborated.\n\n“Following this, the premier was convinced that if Punjab is providing adequate funds from its own kitty, then why should the federal government, which has limited funds, spend its money for the same cause.”\n\nAnother senior PPP leader, who did not wish to be named, said his party had no objection if the BISP was not being used for flood programmes in Punjab, provided that the rehabilitation package recently launched by CM Maryam would fully compensate the flood-hit people, especially farmers.\n\nThe leader said the recent protests by the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Paki­stan was one of the reasons that the party had stopped its confrontation with the PML-N as the country was passing through a critical situation in which all ruling allies needed to stand together to foil any attempt to disrupt peace in the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nFLOOD EMERGENCY\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nPPP, PML-N announce jointly contesting upcoming by-elections\nPPP decides to give PML-N ‘more time’ to fulfil demands\nPunjab CM Maryam launches flood rehabilitation drive, says Rs100bn will be distributed under the initiative\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
