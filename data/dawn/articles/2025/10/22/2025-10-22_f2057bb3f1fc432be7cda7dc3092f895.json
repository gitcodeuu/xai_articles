The prime minister also acknowledged the Special Investment Facilitation Council’s (SIFC) role in enabling strong public-private collaboration and facilitating investments that underpin national technology initiatives.\n\nIn her remarks, Minister for IT and Telecommunications Shaza Fatima Khawaja reaffirmed the government’s commitment to developing a digitally empowered Pakistan.\n\nDr Naveed Sherwani, chairman of the National Semiconductor Task Force, briefed the audience on the strategic roadmap and underlined Pakistan’s opportunity to build a world-class semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nAbu Bakar of PSEB said it was a matter of pride to have executed the semiconductor programme, which will train thousands of professionals and link academia, research, and industry to develop a sustainable national semiconductor ecosystem.\n\nTraining and research\n\nINSPIRE aims to train 7,200 professionals over five years in semiconductor design, verification, and research. It will be engaging nine public-sector universities across Pakistan’s northern, central, and southern regions and establishing six integrated circuit (IC) labs.\n\nAs the first phase of the country’s broader National Semiconductor Develop­ment Roadmap, INSPIRE will lay the foundation for Outsourced Assembly & Testing (OSAT) and fabrication capabilities, enabling Pakistan to take part in the global semiconductor supply chain.\n\nWith the launch of INSPIRE, Pakistan has entered a new chapter of digital transformation — one defined by innovation, opportunity, and resilience.\n\nThe initiative embodies a national vision to harness youth potential, strengthen international partnerships, and position Pakistan as a credible contributor to the trillion-dollar global semiconductor industry.\n\nRestructuring Smeda\n\nEarlier, PM Shehbaz presided over a meeting on a restructuring plan for the Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority. He directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of small and medium enterprises to enable them to avail of business loans and stimulate industrial growth.\n\nHe said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs. He expressed satisfaction over the efforts made by the Ministry of Industries and Production for Smeda’s restructuring.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nInterior minister briefs PM Shehbaz on law and order situation\nTrump thanks PM Shehbaz and ‘my favourite’ Field Marshal Asim Munir for Gaza peace efforts\nPM Shehbaz arrives in Malaysia for ‘comprehensive’ talks on economic engagement\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
