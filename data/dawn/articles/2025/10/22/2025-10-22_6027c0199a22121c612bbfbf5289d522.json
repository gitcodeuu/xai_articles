However, this year’s timely interventions, improved surveillance, and coordinated field operations kept the situation well under control.\n\nHe added that close coordination with the Islamabad administration had also been ensured to prevent the spread of dengue across adjoining areas.\n\nDuring the meeting, the provincial minister was briefed on the comprehensive anti-dengue measures taken by the district administration.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, MNA Tahira Aurangzeb said all departments worked together as one team to tackle the dengue challenge effectively. She added that, under the special directions of Chief Minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz Sharif, public awareness campaigns, household inspections, and a rapid response system were strengthened.\n\nShe emphasised that citizen cooperation and the dedicated efforts of the district administration played a vital role in controlling dengue in Rawalpindi.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Dr Hasan Waqar Cheema said that all departments remain fully active in daily monitoring and surveillance activities. “Our goal,” he said, “is to make Rawalpindi a model district for dengue control so that other districts can replicate this strategy successfully.”\n\nOn the other hand, as many as 25 new dengue cases were reported in the federal capital in a single day.\n\nAccording to the District Health Office (DHO), out of the 25 cases, 14 were reported from rural areas and 11 from urban areas.\n\nFive cases were reported from Tarlai, three each from Bhara Kahu, and two each from I-14, I-9, and Sohan. Moreover, one case each was reported from B-17, F-15, G-10, G-14, G-6, G-7, I-8, Koral, Kurri, Rawat and Shah Allah Ditta.\n\n“As many as 59 patients are admitted to hospitals, and response to all cases has been carried out in accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols,” an official of the DHO said.\n\nThe District Health Office, Islamabad, has urged the public to follow preventive measures, particularly regular cleaning of water containers, tanks, and coolers, to help stop the spread of dengue. Citizens have been encouraged to play an active role in protecting their own health and that of others.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the dengue virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito.\n\nThe most common symptoms of dengue are high-grade fever accompanied by joint and muscular pain. As vaccines are not available in most parts of the world, early detection and proper medical care can lower mortality. Otherwise, the disease may turn into a life-threatening haemorrhagic fever, which can lead to bleeding and dangerously low blood pressure.\n\nRapid and unplanned urbanisation, poor sanitation and climate change are all contributing to the surge in dengue infections.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nKP CM orders public awareness amid upswing in dengue cases\nSindh govt downplays dengue outbreak, confirms 276 new cases in October\nDengue cases spike in twin cities despite drop in temperature\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
