Initially, the petitioner did not turn up, but appeared later as the court asked his counsel to ensure his presence.\n\nThe bench in its orders noted that, as per police reports, both the petitioners have not approached the SHO to lodge FIRs.\n\nThe bench asked the petitioners to lodge FIRs for their missing father and husband, respectively.\n\nIn case the petitioners approach the SHO of Sachal police station, he shall lodge FIRs in verbatim, it added.\n\nThe bench further directed the SHO to come up with copies of both FIRs on November 18.\n\nEarlier, the son of Mr Panhwar in his petition had also contended that his father had been a victim of enforced disappearances on multiple occasions by law enforcement agencies, and it was the fourth such incident, highlighting a pattern of illegal abductions targeting political dissidents.\n\nThe petitioner further maintained that Mr Panhwar had served as a Member of the National Assembly from 2003 to 2007 and the Provincial Assembly of Sindh from 2008 to 2013.\n\nHe submitted that his father was an elderly individual and known to be suffering from diabetes, which required consistent and specialised care, while the petitioner had approached the police to locate the whereabouts of his father, but to no avail.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2025\n\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nSHC orders report on animals’ health and living conditions at Karachi Zoo\nSHC dismisses petition against construction of 14-storey project in Bath Island\nMQM-P asserts stakeholders’ role in Hyderabad relief works\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
