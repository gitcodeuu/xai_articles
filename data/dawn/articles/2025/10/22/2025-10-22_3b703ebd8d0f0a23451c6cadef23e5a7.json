Playing at home is not the same as playing away. Villarreal away is tough, and it’s not fair to change the rules mid-season without consulting us.”\n\nSilent protests\n\nLaLiga players staged silent protests over the weekend by standing motionless at kickoffs, though these demonstrations were not shown in official television broadcasts, which displayed banners reading “Commitment to peace”.\n\nLaLiga, which was set to begin selling the tickets for the game on Wednesday , maintains that the initiative complied with all regulations and would not have distorted the competition.\n\n“In a context of increasing global competitiveness, where leagues such as the Premier League and competitions such as the UEFA Champions League continue to increase their reach and capacity to generate resources, initiatives such as this are essential to ensure the sustainability and growth of Spanish football,” LaLiga said.\n\n“Giving up such opportunities hinders the generation of new revenue, limits the ability of clubs to invest and compete, and reduces the international profile of the entire national football ecosystem.”\n\nSPORT\n0\nRead more\nReal go top in La Liga after nervy win at Getafe\nPSG hit seven, Barcelona, Arsenal run riot as Champions League rains goals\nSubstitute Araujo nets late winner as Barca edge Girona\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
