He had also claimed that the teargas launcher and bottles of liquor were not his and that he had been carrying honey in the liquor bottle.\n\nSubsequently, a case was registered against Gandapur at the capital’s Bhara Kahu police station.\n\nArrest warrants have been issued for Gandapur in the case multiple times since over his non-appearance, including on October 5, 2024, September 4, 2024, July 19, 2025 and Sept 10, 2025.\n\nPAKISTAN\n0\nRead more\nFive Kalashnikovs recovered from PTI leader's car outside Bani Gala\nImran’s nephew moves Lahore High Court against his military trial\nIslamabad court issues arrest warrant for KP chief minister\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles",
