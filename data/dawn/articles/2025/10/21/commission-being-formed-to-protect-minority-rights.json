He urged Muslims and non-Muslims to work “shoulder to shoulder” to resist hatred, intolerance and extremism and to preserve Pakistan as a land of tolerance and peaceful coexistence.\n\nMinister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Ko­­histani, on the occasion, paid tribute to the prime minister for organising Diw­ali celebrations officially at the PM House, making a unique historic moment.\n\nIndustrial production\n\nPM Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed the Power Division to develop effective policy recommendations aimed at enhancing domestic industrial production. He also urged all institutions involved in industrial production to take comprehensive measures to facilitate investors and industrialists.\n\nEmphasising the government’s commitment to supporting the agriculture and industrial sectors, the prime minister directed the formulation of a policy to maximise the beneficial use of the country’s power production.\n\n“Electricity production can be best leveraged to increase the output of agricultural and industrial goods,” he said while chairing a meeting on power sector reforms.\n\nDuring the meeting, the prime minister was briefed on a potential reform package focused on the comprehensive and efficient utilisation of the country’s power resources.\n\nRegistration of cottage SMEs\n\nLater, presiding over a separate meeting on small and medium enterprises (SMEs), PM Shehbaz directed the authorities concerned to encourage the registration of cottage SMEs to enable them avail business loans and pave the way for country’s industrial growth.\n\nThe prime minister appreciated the initiatives to enhance women’s participation in SMEs and called for awareness on such measures. He emphasised setting up a clear timeline for the implementation of Small and Medium Enterprises Development Authority’s (Smeda) roadmap and its early execution.\n\nThe prime minister said the country’s industrial growth was linked with the development of cottage SMEs and cited the developed countries where they provide raw material to large industries. The premier directed to conduct the training for SMEs in rural areas for processing of agricultural commodities.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction with the industries and production ministry’s efforts for Smeda’s restructuring and SME development.\n\nDuring the briefing on Smeda’s restr­u­cturing and initiatives, it was informed that offices had been established in Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan for SME development, which was welcomed by the public and chambers of commerce.\n\nThe meeting was told that a Smeda board comprising private sector experts had been formed, and the appointment of the chief executive officer will be finalised in the coming days. The participants were told that following the directives of the steering committee, a significant progress had been witnessed in SME capacity building, loan provision, and collaboration.\n\nBesides, an AI-powered women entrepreneurship platform is being established to provide women with comprehensive business-related information, including registrations, tax matters and skill awareness.\n\nMoreover, a roadmap for integrating SMEs into the formal economy was also presented during the meeting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025\n\nMINORITY RIGHTS\nNEWSPAPER\n   \n0\nRead more\nEnd to all forms of discrimination, acceptance of diversity urged at Minority Rights March in Karachi\nBill to establish commission for minority rights approved by Senate subcommittee\nPM, president stress protecting minority rights, hail their patriotism\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
