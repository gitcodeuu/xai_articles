The recommendations came from a sub-committee which was formed, comprising Dr Mirza Ikhtiar Baig, Ms Tahira Aurangzeb, Farhan Chishti and Gul Asghar Khan.\n\nThe report of the sub-committee was discussed at the National Assembly Stan­ding Committee on Commerce, chaired by Jawed Hanif Khan, on Monday. The meeting assessed progress on key trade-related matters, including export diversification, regulatory reforms, industrial competitiveness, and the implementation of the national trade policy.\n\nThe committee adopted the report presented by the ministry of commerce and emphasised the need to identify individuals responsible for past decisions permitting sugar exports against national interest.\n\nMr Jawed underscored that repeated errors warranted a detailed inquiry into those who facilitated such actions and stressed that accountability must be ensured.\n\nThe chairman further directed that the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) be called to explain its failure to curb cartelisation in the sugar sector.\n\nReviewing progress on SPS compliance, rice exports, and commercial attachés, the committee was informed that EU rice interceptions had declined significantly, and seafood exports rose to $466 million in FY25. The commerce ministry highlighted its Agro-Products Export Enhancement Roadmap, the formation of Sectoral Councils, and measures to boost exports of pharmaceuticals, leather, and marble.\n\nThe committee directed that a detailed briefing be presented in the next meeting on efforts to address non-tariff barriers, particularly by the United States.\n\nRegarding the Pakistan Reinsurance Company Ltd (PRCL), the committee sought a full justification for the retrospective salary increase of the former CEO from Rs500,000 to Rs2.4 million per month, including multiple benefits.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025\n\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nTrading Corporation of Pakistan buys 80,000 tonnes of sugar\nTrading Corporation of Pakistan buys 80,000 tonnes of sugar\nPakistan buys initial 30,000 tonnes sugar in tender, traders say\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
