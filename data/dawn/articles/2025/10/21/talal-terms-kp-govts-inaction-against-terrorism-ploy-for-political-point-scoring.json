He also criticised the Centre for providing KP Police “defective and old” armoured vehicles and asked that the vehicles be recalled.\n\nAddressing the media today, the state minister took exception to the KP CM’s earlier remarks and stated, “the operation you are rejecting may serve you well politically, but it will also lead to loss of lives, for which you alone will be held responsible.”\n\nTalal expressed disappointment that the “fight against terrorism and sacrifices made by soldiers were being overshadowed by politics”.\n\n“You don’t want to fight against terrorists, you are scared, you have political motives,” said Talal, alleging that the PTI-led provincial government was choosing not to fight the war against terrorism, “so they could use it to blackmail the government.”\n\nCiting Article 148 of the Constitution, the minister warned that “provinces can not unilaterally make any decision which affects the rest of the country”.\n\n“The fight against terrorism is the entire country’s fight,” maintained the state minister for interior.\n\nOn the matter of the CM’s recent appointment, Talal said that it was a deliberate decision to elect someone “who would not hesitate to prioritise political point scoring and his chairman’s narrative over matters of national interests and his responsibilities as the chief minister”.\n\nResponding to KP CM’s comments about “defective bulletproof vehicles”, the minister maintained that “it was unfortunate that CM Afridi was returning necessary equipment to make the Centre look weak for political point scoring”.\n\n“If you did not like the bulletproof cars, then maybe give your own instead,” he said, stressing that the KP govt was “not fighting a war but only wasting time and creating unnecessary drama.”\n\nA day earlier, the minister had called the move “immature” and a setback in the fight against terrorism, the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) reported.\n\n“What’s unfortunate is that the police officers in KP are fighting terrorists without any equipment,” he said, adding that the provincial govt was “refusing to stand with them.”\n\nHe also claimed that there was a “different agenda” at play, stating that “changing the chief minister was never about benefiting the people”.\n\nAlthough the federal government in August ruled out a new offensive, it continues counterterrorism operations under the National Action Plan.\n\nPakistan has been witnessing a rise in terrorist incidents, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire deal with the state in November 2022 and vowed to target security officials, police, and LEAs personnel.\n\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nCM Afridi blames Centre’s ‘flawed policy’ for terrorism resurgence in KP\nImran Khan has offered to ‘resolve Afghanistan problem’ if freed on parole: PTI’s Barrister Gohar\nPML-N ministers blame Imran for rise in terrorism\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n \n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\n \nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\n \nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\n \nCan International Law Stop Wars?\n \nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\n \nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\n \nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\n \nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
