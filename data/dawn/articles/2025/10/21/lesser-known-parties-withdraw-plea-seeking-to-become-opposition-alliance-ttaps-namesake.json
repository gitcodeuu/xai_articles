The applicants, who also sought the allocation of a joint election symbol, included Pakistan Aman Tehreek Chairman Ali Sher Yousafzai, Pakistan Falahi Tehreek Chairman Fazal Aman Khan, and Pakistan Welfare Party Chairman Muhammad Farooq.\n\nThe TTAP — which saw the move as an attempt to take away its title and sabotage its resistance movement — had formed a legal team to defend its position before the ECP, with Mustafa Nawaz Khokhar appearing before the commission today.\n\nThe matter was heard by a three-member ECP bench headed by the member from Balochistan, Shah Mohammad Jatoi.\n\nDuring the hearing, the Pakistan Falahi Tehreek chairman told the ECP that the parties had not applied for the registration of the alliance.\n\n“We were informed that we had filed an application through a notice issued by the election commission,” he said.\n\nAt this, the ECP member from Punjab, Babar Hassan Bharwana, remarked, “We did not issue a notice ourselves; someone must have applied.”\n\nHe also called for a forensic analysis of the application, saying, “You should consult your legal adviser and apologise if you have applied by mistake.”\n\nThe ECP told the three parties to withdraw the application, warning that action would be taken against them otherwise.\n\nFor his part, Khokhar filed a request seeking the provision of records. Khokhar said that an opposition alliance had been formed under Achakzai’s leadership called the TTAP. He urged the ECP to not entertain the plea.\n\nThe ECP then sought detailed statements from the three applicants and said it would issue and appropriate order. Later, the applicants submitted handwritten requests seeking the withdrawal of their application.\n\nVeteran politician Achakzai, who also heads his own Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party (PkMAP), was made chairman of the TTAP, weeks after the February 8 general elections. The PTI, PkMAP and Balochistan National Party-Mengal are among the major parties of the alliance.\n\nThe alliance alleges that the mandate of PTI was stolen and it does not acknowledge the present government as a genuine representative of the voters. The opposition alliance recently put on hold its countrywide public meetings and protests, mainly, in the wake of floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab.\n\n‘Space for opposition getting narrower’\n\nSpeaking to the media outside the ECP, Khokhar termed the application a “childish thought”.\n\n“Space for the opposition in this country is growing narrower and narrower,” Khokhar said, decrying the move to steal the TTAP’s name.\n\nSpeaking about the opposition alliance, he said, “This has been underway for a long time … the largest opposition party, PTI is a part of it; the Majlis Wahdat-e-Muslimeen is also a part of it; Balochistan National Party’s Akhtar Mengal is also a part of it; other parties and civil society individuals are also a part of it.”\n\nHe also went on to say that such requests should not be entertained. “If we want to run this country in a better way, in an acceptable way where the rule of law governs, then we should refrain from these kind of requests,” he said.\n\n“The three parties that came today — we didn’t even know who they were — they submitted their withdrawal application. But for the future … we are also clever, and we will not back off in the face of such efforts. We will continue to defend and promote our right to political opposition,” he said.\n\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nLittle-known parties seek to become opposition alliance’s namesake\nOpposition alliance Tehreek Tahafuz Ayeen-i-Pakistan launches nationwide drive from Pishin\nOpposition alliance TTAP urges talks with Kabul, joint parliamentary session\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles",
