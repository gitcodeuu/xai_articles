India blamed Pakistan without presenting evidence, further inflaming hostilities between the two nuclear-armed neighbours. Pakistan later launched a retaliatory “Operation Bunyanum Marsoos”, leading to heavy artillery and drone exchanges before a US-led push helped broker a ceasefire.\n\nAddressing a passing out parade at the Pakistan Military Academy (PMA) in Kakul, COAS Munir said, “I advise and firmly caution India’s military leadership that there is no space for war in a nuclearised environment.”\n\nCalling on New Delhi to settle core issues as per international norms, the army chief asserted, “We will never be intimidated nor coerced by your rhetoric and shall respond decisively, beyond proportions, to even a minor provocation without any qualms.\n\n“The onus of ensuing escalations — one that may ultimately bear catastrophic consequences for the entire region and beyond — will squarely lie with India.”\n\n“Should a fresh wave of hostilities be triggered, Pakistan would respond much beyond the expectations of the initiators,” COAS Munir warned.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n“With diminishing distinctions between conflict and communication zones, the reach and lethality of our weapon systems will shatter the misconceived immunity of India’s geographic warspace.\n\n“The deeply hurting retributive military and economic losses inflicted will be much beyond the imagination and calculation of the perpetrators of chaos and instability,” he said.\n\n“The battle-hardened army, which has fought for over two decades in the sub-conventional domain, has successfully displayed its capabilities in the conventional domain, as well as by delivering a swift and decisive blow to the adversary,” he said.\n\n“Ever since the creation of Pakistan, the armed forces, with full support of the nation, have defended the external and internal frontiers of the country with unfailing resolve, conviction and pride.\n\n“The most recent display of this spirit and resolve of the armed forces of Pakistan during Marka-i-Haq [and] Operation Bunyan um Marsoos has further strengthened the trust and confidence of the people of Pakistan in the competence and far-reaching capabilities of its armed forces by neutralising all threats with remarkable professionalism,” COAS Munir said, referring to the four-day May conflict with India.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n“Downing advanced […] Rafales, targeting multiple bases including S-400s, and showcasing multi-domain warfare capabilities, Pakistan has displayed its capabilities and will to defend,” COAS Munir asserted.\n\nHe further said that “people of hues and colours, age, gender, ethnicity or creed, stood firm and tall like a wall of steel, leading to a renewed spirit of patriotism and national fervour, which prevails across the length and breadth of Pakistan”.\n\n“Our collective success has re-energised and strengthened the proud and illustrious memories of our earlier successes. Pakistan once again came out victorious against a treacherous enemy marked by strategic blindness and naivety, and filled with hubris and rhetoric about its misguided hegemonic ambitions.\n\n“India’s eagerness to adjudge culpability, aversion to neutral investigations and staking self-created evidence was indicative of politicisation of terrorism for vested interests of the ruling regime,” he added.\n\nCOAS Munir went on to say, “Pakistan, on the other hand, gained deep admiration of the people of Pakistan and the international community because of the legitimacy and the clear victory against a numerically superior adversary.\n\n“Internally, it has further unified our nation and strengthened our resolve to defend against any threat, whether external or internal. It has reinforced confidence, particularly amongst the youth, that the armed forces of Pakistan are an essential element of national power and trusted with the responsibility to protect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state,” he said, assuring the nation that “we will not lose an inch of this sacred land”.\n\nHe commended the “valour of the people of Pakistan — every soldier, sailor, airman; the brave men, women and children and the elderly who laid their lives during these testing times; and the warriors who fought with the utmost conviction to defend their motherland at all costs”.\n\n“The national leadership, the bureaucracy, scholars, scientists, media, academia, and most importantly, the youth deserve rich tribute for standing firmly against aggression,” the army chief added.\n\nThe army chief also spoke on Pakistan’s economy, hailing the government’s “relentless efforts” for relative stability and noting that positive economic indicators were attracting investments from across the world.\n\n“The treasures hidden beneath our land for decades have started to surface as a silver lining for our bright future. Our vibrant youth, filled with talent, is making marvels in a multitude of domains.”\n\nHe also reiterated his cautions about social media, calling on people to be cognisant of threats “proliferating via digital media, populist anarchism and social subversion”.\n\n“Unfortunately, in the post-truth era in which we live, perceptions bear more weight than reality and half-truths spread faster than facts. Your strength will lie in thinking critically and discerning fact from fiction,” he said, urging them to not become “tools of disinformation”.\n\nChoose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS tells Kabul\n\nThe army chief also reiterated Pakistan’s stance that India “continues with state-sponsored terrorism”.\n\n“Our adversary’s use of Fitna al-Hind and Fitna al-Khawarij as hired guns exposes its … hypocritical and heinous face to the world. Equally disconcerting is the use of Afghan soil for terrorism in Pakistan,” he said.\n\nFitna al-Khawarij is a term the state uses for terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan and Fitna al Hindustan for Balochistan-based groups to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.\n\nUrging the people of Afghanistan to choose mutual security over perpetual violence, COAS Munir urged the “Afghan Taliban regime to rein in the proxies who have sanctuaries in Afghanistan”.\n\n“Rest assured, like our victory in the conventional domain, every state proxy of our neighbour will be razed to dust, God-willing,” he asserted, vowing to never bow before “misguided terrorists having a perverted interpretation of Islam”.\n\nSpeaking on occupied Kashmir, the army chief said India’s “oppression and widespread atrocities” in the valley will also come to an end. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s diplomatic and moral support for the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle till the resolution of the dispute in accordance with United Nations’ resolutions.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\n‘Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser’\n\nDuring his address, COAS Munir noted that the world was witnessing “increased fragility and volatility, with a discernible shift towards violence as an instrument for attaining political objectives”.\n\n“Amidst the chaos, Pakistan has successfully emerged as a net regional stabiliser. Our relations with key global and regional powers, particularly Muslim countries, have further strengthened.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThe army chief stated that Pakistan had persistently “proven to be a key contributor toward peace and stability in the region and beyond”, highlighting Pakistan’s armed forces’ contributions to UN peacekeeping missions.\n\nHe also mentioned the Strategic Mutual Defence Agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, terming it a “reinforcement and formalisation of Pakistan-Saudi brotherhood and a step towards ensuring peace and stability in the Middle East and South Asia”.\n\nCOAS Munir said Islamabad had also made “humble contributions towards peaceful steering of the negotiations with Iran”, adding that Pakistan’s relations with all Muslim countries were “thriving at an exponential” rate.\n\nHailing Pakistan’s historic “all-weather strategic cooperative partnership“ with China, the army chief also noted: “Re-energisational and strong and growing relations with the United States of America are an encouraging and welcome development.”\n\nHe lauded US President Donald Trump, saying that his “personal efforts and strategic leadership to bring peace to multiple conflict-prone areas of the world are really praiseworthy”.\n\n“We will further nurture these relations with key global and regional players for the interest of peace, security, and development.”\n\nCOAS Munir also assailed Israel for its “blatant aggression, genocide and forced displacement waged upon Palestinians”.\n\nHighlighting Pakistan’s “significant” role in the diplomatic efforts to secure the recent peace in Gaza, the field marshal said Pakistan expects the ceasefire to continue, followed by a smooth flow of humanitarian relief and the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\n“Pakistan stands by its principled stance of indispensability of the two-state solution and the need for an independent, sovereign and viable State of Palestine based on pre-1967 war borders, with Al Quds Sharif as its capital,” he reaffirmed.\n\n‘Enemies hell-bent upon driving a wedge between people, armed forces’\n\nAddressing the cadets, he highlighted that they were being commissioned into “one of the finest armies across the world, which is second to none, respected by all and sundry”.\n\n“This demands your absolute loyalty to [Pakistan, to the armed forces and the sacred task being entrusted onto your shoulders,” he underscored.\n\n“Remember, our enemies are hell-bent upon driving a wedge between our people and the armed forces for their ulterior motives. Let me remind them that the bond between the people and the armed forces is unshakable,” the field marshal asserted.\n\nHe told the cadets that nothing should be more sacred than the safety and security of the people of Pakistan and no duty more binding than the defence of the country.\n\n“The defence doctrine of Pakistan is predicated on credible deterrence and perpetual readiness, encompassing the full spectrum of capabilities. As a professional standing army, our conventional prowess through constant doctrinal and technological evolution has been optimised into a dynamic, integrated and adaptive force,” the army chief said.\n\nUnderscoring the need for intellectual readiness and technological advancements, COAS Munir told the cadets to “embrace innovation, life-long learning and adaptability to meet modern threats”.\n\nAt the outset of his address, the army chief extended his warm greetings and appreciation to the “immaculately turned-out gentlemen and lady cadets for the outstanding display of professionalism and discipline”.\n\nHe also expressed his compliments to the cadets from friendly countries of Malaysia, Nepal, Palestine, Qatar, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Yemen, Mali, Maldives, and Nigeria for “successful completion of the formative training at this prestigious institution”.\n\n“This is a moment of pride for you and all of us, reflective of the strong bond of military cooperation and international camaraderie,” COAS Munir said.\n\nHe highlighted that the PMA’s role “as a cornerstone of military excellence has always remained commendable, and the standards exhibited today are no less reflective of the same”.\n\nPAK INDIA TIES, TERRORISM IN PAKISTAN, PAKISTAN INDIA TENSIONS\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nAfter May conflict, India trying to mould history by inventing outlandish, Bollywood-style scripts: ISPR\nCOAS says India won’t be allowed to choke Indus River\nArmy brass warns India any ‘imaginary new normal’ to be met with ‘new normal of swift retributive response’\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n \n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\n \nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\n \nCan International Law Stop Wars?\n \nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\n \nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\n \nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\n \nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\n \nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles",
