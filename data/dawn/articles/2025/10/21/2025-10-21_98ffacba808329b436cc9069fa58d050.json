It further maintained that the bar has historically been at the forefront of struggles for constitutional supremacy and must therefore be heard in this matter.\\n\\nThe plea recalled that the bar’s functions include facilitating its members in the performance of their professional duties, protecting their interests, and maintaining high standards of integrity and ethical conduct.\\n\\n“The Islamabad Bar is resolute in shielding the superior judiciary from attacks, whether internal or external, and in striving for the supremacy of the Constitution,” the application stated.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025",
