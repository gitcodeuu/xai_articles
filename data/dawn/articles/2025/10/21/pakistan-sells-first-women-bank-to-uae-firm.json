The UAE delegation was led by Sheikh Zayed bin Hamdan bin Zayed Al Nahyan, chairman of 2PointZero.\n\nThe federal cabinet had earlier approved the divestment of the government’s entire stake in FWBL, reportedly valued at $14.6 million (approximately Rs4.1 billion), a figure yet to be formally disclosed.\n\nBuyer to inject Rs6.8bn more to meet capital requirements\n\nIn addition to acquiring the bank, IHC will meet the total minimum capital requirement of Rs10bn over five years. As of December 2024, FWBL’s equity stood at Rs3.2bn, with the new investor set to inject Rs6.8bn to bridge the gap.\n\nPrivatisation momentum\n\nPM Shehbaz attributed the successful closure of the deal to the “determined and focused” leadership of Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar and Adviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali. He reaffirmed his government’s commitment to restructuring state-owned enterprises and enabling private sector-led economic growth.\n\nHe added that FWBL’s founding mission — to support women entrepreneurs — would not only be preserved but also strengthened through professional management and targeted investments in sectors such as agriculture and industry.\n\nIHC sees long-term growth\n\nIHC Chief Executive Syed Basar Shueb said the investment signals confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reflects a shared vision for long-term development.\n\n“We see strong potential in the country’s financial sector and look forward to supporting the bank’s modernisation journey by leveraging technology, automating banking processes, and advancing the use of AI in financial decision-making,” he said.\n\nAccording to an official statement, this marks the first bank privatisation conducted under the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act 2022. FWBL, established in 1989, currently operates 42 branches across Pakistan, serving retail, SME, and corporate clients.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 18th, 2025\n\nFollow Dawn Business on X, LinkedIn, Instagram and Facebook for insights on business, finance and tech from Pakistan and across the world.\nPAK UAE TIES\nNEWSPAPER\n0\nRead more\nGovt speeds up outsourcing of KPT terminal\nPakistan, UAE sign MOU on visa exemption at 12th JMC session held after 13-year gap\nUAE, Pakistan reaffirm strategic partnership\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles",
