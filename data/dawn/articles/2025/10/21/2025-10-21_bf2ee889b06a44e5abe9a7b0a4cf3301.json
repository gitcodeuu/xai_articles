Health Minister Mustafa Kamal also attended the meeting.\\n\\nJust after the start of the meeting, Dr Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro raised the issue of exorbitant fees of medical and dental colleges. She said that colleges were charging much more as compared to the existing fee which is capped at Rs1.8 million.\\n\\nSays colleges’ registration can be cancelled\\n\\nDr Rizwan said that the council has taken notice of the overcharging of fees.\\n\\n“It is correct that some of the colleges have been charging more. We have issued show cause notice to them. The matter will also be referred to the committee,” he said.\\n\\nHowever, the health minister Mustafa Kamal said that there was provision in the rules to increase fees but colleges have to provide a reason for it.\\n\\nHe said that out of 188 medical and dental colleges, 122 were private.\\n\\nHe said a national level survey would be held to look into the issue.\\n\\nHe said that show cause notices were issued to most of the medical colleges of Islamabad.\\n\\nPMDC Official Dr Rehan Naqvi also said that the show cause notices were issued to 14 colleges.\\n\\nWhile discussing the Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT), members raised concerns over the two-year validity of test results and the absence of a relative marking system.\\n\\nIt was observed that the policy discouraged high-achieving students from reapplying.
