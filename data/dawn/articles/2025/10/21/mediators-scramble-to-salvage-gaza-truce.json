The talks will also focus on implementing the ceasefire and an upcoming intra-Palestinian dialogue in Egypt.\n\nIn Israel, US envoys Ste­ve Witkoff and Tru­mp’s son-in-law Jared Kushner met with Netanyahu to corral both sides to get the ceasefire back on track.\n\nThe visit, scheduled before the weekend flare-up, was expected to push for talks on the next phase of the 20-step plan. US Vice President JD Vance was also due to visit Israel on Tuesday.\n\nTrump warns Hamas\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump, who brokered the truce, insisted the deal was still in place but issued a stark warning to Hamas.\n\n“We made a deal with Hamas that they’re going to be very good, they’re going to behave, they’re going to be nice,” Trump told reporters.\n\n“And if they’re not, we’re going to go and we’re going to eradicate them, if we have to. They’ll be eradicated, and they know that.”\n\nTrump suggested Ha­­mas’s leadership may not be responsible for truce violations. “We think maybe the leadership isn’t involved in that,” he said aboard Air Force One.\n\nIsrael kills again\n\nOn Monday, the violence continued as Israeli fire killed three people near a newly established ceasefire line inside Gaza, Palestinian medics said.\n\nEarlier, Israel unlea­sh­­ed its massive bombardm­ent on Sunday after it clai­med a Palestinian attack killed two of its soldiers operating within an agre­­ed deployment line in southern Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu told the Knesset on Monday that Israel had dropped 153 ton­­nes of bombs on Gaza in response. Hamas said it was unaware of any cla­sh­­es in the area and had not been in contact with groups there.\n\nHamas has instead det­ailed what it calls a series of violations by Israel sin­ce the truce began, which it says killed 46 people and stopped essential supplies from reaching the enclave. Since the agreement on Oct 11, Israeli for­ces have committed over 80 violations, Palestinian sources said.\n\nCeasefire resumed\n\nThe United Nations expressed alarm over the violence, with spokesperson Stephane Dujarric stating the UN was “concerned by all acts of violence in Gaza.”\n\n“We urge all parties to honour all of their commitments to ensure the protection of civilians and avoid any actions that could lead to a renewal of hostilities and undermine humanitarian operations,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025\n\nGAZA INVASION\nNEWSPAPER\n   \n0\nRead more\nCeasefire at stake as Israeli barrage claims dozens of lives in Gaza\nIsrael violated ceasefire 80 times since Oct 10: Gaza govt media office\nTrump says Gaza ceasefire still in force after Israeli strikes\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
