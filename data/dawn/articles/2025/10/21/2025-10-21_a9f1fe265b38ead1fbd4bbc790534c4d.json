It’s a big market, with tens of thousands of manufacturers and many states to deal with.”\n\nLast week, Reuters reported that India plans to scrap its export rule once companies upgrade their facilities to international standards by a year-end deadline.\n\nIndia’s health ministry and the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), the federal pharmaceuticals regulator, did not return requests for comment on the plans.\n\nRepresentatives of Sresan Pharma did not respond to repeated telephone calls.\n\nA WHO spokesperson said by email on Monday that the agency welcomed all steps to improve medicine quality.\n\nHowever, in response to a question about dropping the export tests, the spokesperson said medicines, including raw materials, should be tested throughout the production process, not just at the end.\n\nBy law, Indian drugmakers must test each batch of raw materials and the final product, but CDSCO said in October some firms had not been doing this.\n\nKuwana said countries, including Pakistan had attended WHO training, on testing for the toxins, and a new, cheaper test had been developed.\n\nRepresentatives from India did not attend but it has confirmed to the WHO that it is using the method, he added.\n\nThere has also been a lack of accountability for the previous incident, Kuwana said, which he described as a “big disappointment”. Despite the deaths abroad, there is no record of anyone being jailed in India.\n\n“This is not just selling fake shoes,” said Kuwana. “This is a moral issue but if you don’t follow the rules, it’s criminal, because it has devastating consequences.”\n\nWORLD\n0\nRead more\nIndia’s Tamil Nadu cancels licence of cough syrup-maker linked to child deaths\nOwner of cough syrup firm linked to 19 deaths held\nWHO seeks India clarification over cough syrup deaths\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
