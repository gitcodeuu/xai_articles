Those, who have lived here for over 40 years, should be sent back in a dignified way. Those stationed on the border should not create issues about the repatriation of Afghan refugees,” he said.\\n\\nThe chief minister said that the police and the counter-terrorism department were leading the fight against terrorists from the front.\\n\\n“The vehicles gifted by the federal government to our police force have become outdated, so we have decided to return them,” he said.\\n\\nEarlier, Leader of the Opposition in the assembly Dr Ibadullah said working for peace in the province was the top priority of every MPA.
