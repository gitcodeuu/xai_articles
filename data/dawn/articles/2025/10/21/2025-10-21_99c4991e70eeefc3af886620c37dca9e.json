She won 11 Six Nations titles.\n\n“It’s been the greatest privilege to wear the England shirt and to represent my country for so many years,” Scarratt said in a Rugby Football Union statement.\n\n“Rugby has given me everything: incredible team-mates, memories, and experiences I’ll carry with me forever.\n\n“I still love the game, but the time feels right to step away. You don’t always get the chance in sport to make that decision for yourself, and I feel so lucky to do so on my own terms, proud of everything I’ve been part of.”\n\nScarratt is the only England player, male or female, to appear at five World Cups.\n\nShe made her final Test appearance, a 20-minute World Cup cameo, in the tournament-opening win over the United States in August.\n\n“From my first cap in 2008 to walking out in front of more than 80,000 people at a World Cup final, the journey has been incredible,” Scarratt added.\n\n“To have witnessed and played a part in the transformation of women’s rugby from amateur to professional is something I’m immensely proud of.”\n\nIn 2023, Scarratt underwent surgery when a bulging disc in her neck threatened her spinal cord.\n\nShe then endured a 13-month recovery period, before making her return for club side Loughborough in February last year.\n\nEngland coach John Mitchell paid tribute to Scarratt, saying: “Emily is a once-in-a-generation player. Her quality, her calmness under pressure, and her ability to lead by example set the standard for everyone around her. “\n\nSPORT\n   \n0\nRead more\nSpringboks earn team, coach, men’s player of year honours\nNZ win women’s rugby sevens gold\nPakistan to feature in Asia Rugby Sevens\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
