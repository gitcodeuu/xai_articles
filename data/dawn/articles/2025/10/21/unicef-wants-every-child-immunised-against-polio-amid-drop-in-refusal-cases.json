Only two drops to every child will ensure eradication of poliomyelitis,” she said.\n\nMs Clement said that with full-fledged backing of government at federal and provincial level, their vaccinators were reaching people to convince them on taking jabs as it was the only way through which polio had been eliminated. She said that once the crippling disease was wiped out, children would grow healthy and would be able to pursue their education and take part in other activities.\n\nOne million children to be vaccinated in Bannu, Lakki Marwat, North and South Waziristan, DI Khan and Tank\n\n“We appeal to all parents to shun the negative propaganda against polio vaccine and don’t give receptive ears to those opposing the drops for the sake of better future their children,” she said.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa has so far recorded 18 polio cases, most of the polio infections of the country’s 29, including nine in Sindh and one each in Punjab and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nHowever, according to a report of Emergency Operation Centre Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the tally of refusals against vaccination dwindled in the campaign carried out in October. In September, vaccinators reported that 14,712 children stayed unimmunised due to reluctance of parents but in October their number dropped to 12,123.\n\nAlso, the number of overall missed children recorded in September was 65,265 which shot up to 72,214 in the recent drive.\n\nAs the second phase of the campaign got under way on Monday, EOC planned to inoculate one million children in Bannu, Lakki Marwat, North and South Waziristan, Dear Ismail Khan and Tank where violent circulation of the virus was in progress.\n\nOf the total cases in the province, four cases each were recorded in Lakki Marwat, North Waziristan and Tank, three in Bannu and one case each in Torghar, Dera Ismail Khan and Kohistan Lower in the current year.\n\nOfficials said that 6,424 teams were deployed for the four-day campaign under strict security arrangements. They said that a total of 10,000 policemen were tasked to provide security to vaccinators during door-to-door campaigns in volatile districts. In the first phase, 6.1 million children received drops, they added.\n\nThey said that Chief Secretary Shahab Ali Shah held meetings with deputy commissioners, district police officers and district health officers to ensure that all target children got vaccine in the campaign as people in those districts were vulnerable to the disease and desperately required vaccination to strengthen their immunity.\n\nThey said that those districts were also known for misinformation regarding polio drops owing to which government asked relevant officials to supervise the drive and convince all the people opposing the drops. They added that government was appreciating frontline health workers, who were reaching to children despite looming threats.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025\n\nPOLIOVIRUS\nPAKISTAN\n0\nRead more\nNumber of polio vaccine refusal cases drops in KP\nKP launches polio immunisation drive, aims to target 5.7m children\nKP launches polio immunisation drive, aims to target 5.7m children\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
