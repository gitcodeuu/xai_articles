These actions have given rise to apprehensions that they may be politically motivated, potentially weakening public trust in the fairness and integrity of the election process.”\n\n“After careful consideration of these concerns, the GB Election Commission believes that such appointments, upgradations, and posting/transfers carried out during the election period risk being viewed as attempts to gain political advantage. This perception could weaken public trust in the neutrality, impartiality, and overall integrity of the electoral process,” the election commission added.\n\n“The commission has also observed growing public concern, regarding the diversion of development funds from approved projects to politically motivated schemes, which clearly constitutes another form of pre-poll influence and has the potential to distort the level playing field among candidates,” the notification said.\n\nIt added that it became necessary for the commission to exercise its lawful powers to maintain neutrality and fairness in governance affairs in order to uphold public confidence in the electoral process, to ensure equal opportunity for all candidates, to protect the sanctity and impartiality of the forthcoming general elections, and to prevent abuse of state resources for electoral advantage.\n\nThe GB chief election commissioner (CEC) thus ordered that all forms of recruitment or appointment in any regional department, organisation or institution were banned with immediate effect except recruitments made through the Federal Public Service Commission and cases where tests/interviews were already completed by today or where recruitment was urgently needed in the public interest.\n\nThe GB CEC further ordered that no new development scheme, community-based initiative or announcement-based project should be awarded, processed or initiated in any form until the next elections were held and a new government assumed office.\n\nFurthermore, any diversion of funds already allocated to development projects in GB was strictly prohibited, with all diverted funds to remain frozen with immediate effect.\n\n“No transfer or posting of government officers/officials shall be made except in cases of genuine public interest, and only after obtaining prior approval/NOC (no-objection certificate) from the GB Election Commission upon submission of a formal proposal.\n\n“No government functionary or elected representative shall announce or inaugurate any new development scheme or project during the election period.\n\n“All development funds relating to local government institutions in GB shall stand frozen with immediate effect until the official announcement of election results. However, in exceptional cases involving extreme urgency or matters of overriding public importance, utilisation of such funds may be permitted strictly upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission,” the notification further ordered.\n\nIt directed that funds allocated to ongoing schemes should continue to be utilised strictly in accordance with the approved Planning Manual and Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Rules without any alteration or modification.\n\nThe notification further stated that no creation, alteration or announcement of new administrative units, sub-divisions or similar territorial entities should be made. during the election period under any circumstances.\n\nListing off more directions, the commission further ordered: “No proposal for the creation of new posts shall be submitted to the GB Finance Department. Likewise, no case of re-designation, up-gradation, concurrence or conveyance of new creation shall be processed by the GB Finance Department or the Services & General Administration Department. However, genuine cases duly justified may be considered only upon obtaining prior approval/NOC from the GB Election Commission.”\n\n“Release of additional funds for new maintenance works is prohibited except in cases of extreme emergency in the public interest, duly justified to and only after obtaining NOC/approval from the GB Election Commission.”\n\n“No new policy, directive, rule or regulation shall be issued or implemented after the issuance of this notification until the formation of the next provincial government.”\n\nThe notification said it would come into force with immediate effect and would remain operative until the conclusion of the forthcoming GB general elections and local government elections.\n\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nPTI terminates basic party membership of 11 GB lawmakers, including CM Gulbar Khan\nGB Assembly echoes public anger over power outages\nGilgit-Baltistan Assembly passes Rs148.63bn budget\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
