Pramedasa International Stadium in Colombo, Sri Lanka on October 21. — PCB\n1x\n1.2x\n1.5x\nJOIN OUR WHATSAPP CHANNEL\n\nPakistan were already staring at defeat before the relentless rains, stop-start in manner, in Colombo sealed their fate.\n\nFatima Sana’s side crashed out of the ICC Women’s World Cup on Tuesday after a crushing 150-run defeat (DLS method) to South Africa in their penultimate match of the league stage at the R. Premadasa Stadium.\n\nPakistan needed a victory to have any chance of staying alive in the last-four race and already-qualified South Africa, but chasing a target that was revised with every downpour, they stood little chance after the Proteas amassed 312-9 in 40 overs.\n\nSpeaking after the match, skipper Fatima said: “I think today is the day bowlers didn’t perform well. We have to accept it. They played very well, but we needed to be calmer in those situations.\n\n“I think after the second over, and after the rain, it was a different situation because the conditions and the ball were wet.”\n\nThe pacer added that the bowlers tried to find rhythm, but it was very difficult to bowl in those conditions.\n\nThe first shower, which had brought upon a two-hour delay, had seen a reduction of 10 overs for each side. By the time Pakistan came out for a third time to bat, their target according to the DLS method was 234 in 20 overs.\n\nPakistan were already up against the wall at that point, struggling at 60-4 after 14 overs. They eventually finished at 83-7.\n\nSouth Africa had been put into bat and after the early loss of opener Tazmin Brits for a duck, skipper Laura Wolvaardt led from the front for the Proteas — scoring 90 and combining with Sune Luus for a 118-run second wicket partnership.\n\nContinuing after the break from 6-1 after two overs, the Pakistan bowlers were taken to all parts as South Africa reached their highest-ever score in the World Cup.\n\nFatima’s side had to rush to the dugout as soon as the match began, after having won the toss and elected to field, as the heavens opened up.\n\nMoments before the players took cover, the Pakistan skipper continued her knack of getting early breakthroughs when she got the dangerous Brits to nick an away swinger to Natalia Parvaiz at first slip.\n\nOnce play resumed, the run-fest started for the Proteas, with the hundred coming up in just 14.2 overs.\n\nAfter Wolvaardt and Luus departed for 90 and 61 respectively, Marizanne Kapp and the dangerous Nadine de Klerk stepped up to take the scoring rate even higher.\n\nDe Klerk continued her fine hitting form in the World Cup — smashing 41 of just 16 deliveries laced with three sixes to take South Africa past the 300-run mark.\n\nPakistan’s reply meandered along aimlessly as the rains made the situation even more ignominious with each passing shower.\n\nChasing a DLS adjusted 302 at the start of their chase, Pakistan opener Muneeba Ali fell early in just the second over to a returning Ayabonga Khaka.\n\nOmaima Sohail was the next to follow when she fell lbw to Marizanne Kapp in a similar manner to her previous outing.\n\nKapp also got the scalps of veteran batters Sidra Amin and Aliya Riaz to end with figures of 3-20.\n\nThe wickets continued to tumble as the Green Shirts stumbled to 60-4 after 14 overs before rain interrupted play again.\n\nWicket-keeper Sidra Nawaz showed some resistance —ending 22 not out as Pakistan continued to lose wickets from the other end in a familiar fashion to end the innings at 83-7.\n\nRains in Colombo had seen Pakistan’s last two matches end in washouts against England and New Zealand, respectively, costing the team a chance to pick up more points in their last-four push. The Green Shirts will now face co-hosts Sri Lanka in their final group encounter on Saturday in a dead-rubber.\n\nThe washed-out New Zealand fixture on Saturday saw South Africa become the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament. Tuesday’s victory saw the Proteas go top of the table.\n\nWOMEN'S WORLD CUP 2025\nSPORT\n   \n0\nRead more\nWeather out of our control but trying our best to make the semis, says Rameen ahead of South Africa clash\nRain plays spoilsport yet again as Pakistan-New Zealand World Cup encounter ends in washout\nPakistan still looking forward to semi-final chance, says Omaima ahead of New Zealand World Cup clash\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
