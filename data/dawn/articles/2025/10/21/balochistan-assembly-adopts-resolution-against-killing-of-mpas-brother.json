Terrorism, by whatever name it occurs, is terrorism and must be condemned,” he said. Mr Bugti added that the adjournment of assembly proceedings reflected collective grief and sent a clear message to terrorists that they could not derail the democratic process. “We will not retreat even an inch from democracy,” he asserted.\n\nHe further said that despite past terrorist attacks on educational institutions, schools and universities were now active again. “The Baloch are being pushed into an unwinnable conflict through terrorism, but we stand with our security forces in this war,” the chief minister stated.\n\nLeader of the Opposition Mir Younas Aziz Zehri said, “The terrorists have martyred Waleed Baloch and plunged the entire province into mourning. If they think such actions can deter us from our mission, they are mistaken. We may live or die, but this province and country will remain.”\n\nIn-camera briefing opposed\n\nMPA Maulana Hidayatur Rehman Baloch criticised the assembly for offering repeated condemnations without action, saying it had “become a place for condolences”. He alleged that armed groups were openly extorting money in his constituency while security personnel focused on minor issues instead of combating terrorism.\n\nHe opposed another in-camera briefing, saying, “Let’s discuss the issue openly instead of holding a speech contest under the name of an in-camera session.”\n\nEarlier, Waleed Saleh Baloch was laid to rest on Sunday at his ancestral graveyard in Panjgur.\n\nHe was gunned down by unidentified assailants near his residence in Chitkan, a locality on the outskirts of Panjgur city.\n\nA large number of people, including leaders of various political parties, Dr. Abdul Malik Baloch, Senator Jan Buledi, MNA Pullain Baloch, Deputy Commissioner Abdul Kabir Zarkoon, District Police Officer Dost Muhammad Bugti, central and provincial leaders of the National Party, tribal elders, and citizens attended the funeral.\n\nBehram Baloch in Gwadar also contributed to this report.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025\n\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nBrother of National Party’s leader killed in Balochistan’s Panjgur\nLittle-known parties seek to become opposition alliance’s namesake\nBalochistan Opposition MPAs stage walkout against Iran border closure\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
