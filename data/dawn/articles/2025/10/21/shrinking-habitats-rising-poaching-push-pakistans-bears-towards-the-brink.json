Human-wildlife conflict, he added, is further exacerbating the situation.\n\nFaizan Ahmad, a researcher at the Pakistan Forest Institute, Peshawar, said the Asiatic black bear — once widespread across Asia’s forests — was now under severe pressure in the country.\n\n“Its population is shrinking, fragmented and increasingly drawn into human-modified landscapes where resource scarcity, habitat degradation, and human–wildlife conflict intersect,” Ahmad told Anadolu.\n\nHe added that as human settlements expand and forest ecosystems become more fragmented, bears are often forced into conflict-prone areas, threatening both conservation efforts and rural livelihoods.\n\nLocal extinction\n\nThere are no official nationwide population surveys for bears in Pakistan, but indirect indicators such as habitat degradation, increased human-bear conflict and poaching reports point to a steady decline.\n\nBased on recent field data, Ahmad said it was reasonable to estimate a 20-30pc population decline in Asiatic black bears over the past decade.\n\nCurrently, around 150-200 Himalayan brown bears survive in small, isolated populations across northern Pakistan. The most stable population is found in GB’s Deosai Plateau, where conservation efforts have led to population growth in recent years.\n\nDeosai National Park remains the only protected area in Pakistan where a regular census is conducted to monitor bear numbers. A smaller population also exists in Khunjerab National Park near the border with China.\n\nThe forested districts of Swat, Kohistan, Upper Dir and Shangla in KP; AJK’s Neelum Valley and GB’s Diamer district host the Himalayan black bear.\n\nAccording to Kabir, the combined population of Himalayan and Balochistan black bears ranges between 1,000 and 1,500 individuals.\n\n“Black bear has vanished from several parts of KP, particularly Ayubia region over the past three to four decades,” he said.\n\nAhmad added that national estimates suggest fewer than 2,500 bears remain across Pakistan, with the Balochistan black bear population likely reduced to fewer than 50 mature individuals.\n\n“This subspecies is now critically endangered in Pakistan and among the least studied large carnivores in the country,” he maintained.\n\nMedicinal value\n\nDespite legal protection, bear cubs are still poached, particularly in early spring when dens are more accessible.\n\n“Local accounts describe poachers lighting fires at den entrances to force mothers and cubs out; the mother is killed, and cubs are sold for bear dancing or bear-baiting,” Ahmad said, referring to the cruel practice where bears are chained and forced to fight dogs for public entertainment.\n\nIn addition to illegal trade, bears are hunted in autumn for their pelts and fat. Kabir explained that bear bile (Xiongdan in Chinese) — the dried gallbladder of the Asiatic black bear — has been used in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) for thousands of years.\n\nHe said it is believed to treat ailments such as liver disorders, fever, digestive problems and inflammation. Bear bile contains ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), a compound also used in modern medicine to treat certain liver diseases and dissolve gallstones.\n\nHowever, the extraction of bile and gallbladders is highly controversial due to its cruelty and devastating impact on wild populations. Conservationists and animal welfare groups have long called for synthetic or plant-based alternatives to bear bile products.\n\nAhmad emphasised that conservation measures must include habitat protection and restoration, conflict mitigation, den protection, community engagement and long-term monitoring.\n\n“Community-based conflict mitigation strategies, such as compensation schemes, use of non-lethal deterrents and crop protection measures are essential to shift from conflict to coexistence,” he said.\n\nHe added that engaging local communities in conservation not only safeguards camera traps and monitoring infrastructure but also encourages local stewardship of wildlife resources.\n\nEcological threat\n\nAzan Karam, a Swat-based wildlife expert, warned that Pakistan’s declining bear population poses a serious ecological threat because bears play a crucial role as both keystone and umbrella species.\n\n“Its presence supports essential ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal, carcass scavenging and insect regulation, all of which contribute to forest regeneration, nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem health,” Karam told Anadolu.\n\nHe said a reduction in bear numbers could disrupt these natural processes, leading to long-term ecological imbalance.\n\n“Moreover, as an umbrella species, conserving the black bear means protecting large, diverse habitats that also support many other wildlife species. Its decline signals broader biodiversity loss across Pakistan’s temperate forests,” he added.\n\nVIOLENCE AGAINST ANIMALS\nPAKISTAN\n0\nRead more\nKMC unable to relocate Rano to sanctuary until Nov 15, SHC told\nRespite for Rano as SHC orders relocation to bear sanctuary within two days\nA bear for a human life: Who is the predator in Mansehra's human-bear conflict?\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
