The accord, emphasising mutual res­pect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, was welcomed by investors as a sign of improving regional stability and potential economic cooperation.\n\nAccording to Topline Securities Ltd, the week opened on a strong note as the bulls dominated the trading floor, propelling the index to an impressive intraday gain of 2,615 points before closing at 166,242, up 2,436 points or 1.49 per cent.\n\nBanking heavyweights led the charge, with Habib Bank, United Bank, Bank of Punjab, National Bank, and Askari Bank, collectively contributing 989 points to the index’s rally. Broader market sentiment remained buoyant throughout the session, as investors poured into equities across multiple sectors.\n\nMarket participation weakened as the trading volume fell 25.27pc to 1.47 billion shares. However, the traded value surged 40.22pc to Rs51.8bn. K-Electric led the volume chart with 229 million shares changing hands.\n\nOverall, the ceasefire-driven optimism set a constructive tone for the week, reinforcing confidence in the market’s upward momentum.\n\nAli Najib, Deputy Head Trading Arif Habib Ltd, said after two consecutive negative sessions, the PSX rebounded sharply on the first day of the week. The session began on a cautious note, extending some of Friday’s selling pressure with the index slipping to an intraday low of 164,282 points (0.29pc). However, value hunters swiftly entered the market at lower levels, reversing sentiment and igniting a broad-based rally.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, Pakistan posted a current account surplus of $110 million in September compared to a $52m deficit in the same month last year and a $325m deficit in August. The session marked a powerful comeback for the bulls, as optimism returned to the trading floor as its again entered into 165,000-170,000 consolidation zone, led by financial heavyweights and supported by improving macro indicators.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025\n\nNEWSPAPER\n   \n0\nRead more\nPower sector drives rally on stock market\nPSX stays green amid volatility, geopolitical tensions\nStock market ends 2024 with historic 84pc gain\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nComments\n500 CHARACTERS COMMENT MOD POLICY",
