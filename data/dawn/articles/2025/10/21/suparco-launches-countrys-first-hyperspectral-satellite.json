This means they can detect tiny differences in light that the human eye, or even normal satellites, can’t see.\n\nIn a statement issued today, Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) said, “The nation’s space agency today announced a breakthrough achievement with the successful launch of Pakistan’s first Hyperspectral Satellite (HS-1) from China.”\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nDetailing the function of the satellite, the statement said, “HS-1 satellite is engineered to capture ultra-precise hyperspectral imagery across hundreds of narrow spectral bands, offering unprecedented resolution for the analysis of land, vegetation, water, and urban features.”\n\n“The cutting-edge technology is set to fundamentally transform Pakistan’s capacity in precision agriculture, rigorous environmental monitoring, urban planning, and proactive disaster management,” it said.\n\n“HS-1 will empower the nation to precisely map crop vitality, soil moisture, and water quality, while rigorously tracking deforestation, pollution, and glacial melt.”\n\nIt added that the satellite will “enhance early warning systems and post-disaster assessments for catastrophic events like floods and landslides, especially across the northern regions”.\n\nPer the agency, the satellite is also expected to aid “development initiatives such as CPEC by preemptively identifying geo-hazard risks and guiding sustainable infrastructure development”.\n\nChairman Suparco, Muhammad Yousaf Khan, “expressed profound gratitude for the Government of Pakistan’s support in bringing this pivotal national project to fruition”, the statement quoted him as saying.\n\n“The data from the Hyperspectral Satellite is poised to revolutionise agricultural productivity, bolster climate resilience, and enable optimised management of the country’s vital natural resources.”\n\nUnderscoring the long-standing partnership between Pakistan and China in space science, the space agency continued: “The mission reflects the ever-growing strategic partnership and deep-rooted friendship between the two nations, who continue to cooperate in advancing peaceful space exploration and harnessing its benefits for socioeconomic development.”\n\n“HS-1’s successful integration into Pakistan’s expanding space fleet marks a decisive step toward solidifying space technology excellence and reinforces Suparco’s vital role in driving national socioeconomic growth through innovative space applications.”\n\nAccording to the press release, Project Director HS-1 Mushtaque Hussain Soomro stressed that the satellite “signals a definitive leap in Pakistan’s ambitious space roadmap, positioning the nation as an emerging leader in space technology for sustainable development”.\n\nHe also hailed the mission team’s collective dedication and technical brilliance, the statement said.\n\nIn a statement from his office, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his appreciation for Pakistani engineers and scientists for the successful launch.\n\n“The cooperation between Pakistan and China in space research, like in other sectors, is exemplary and of key importance,” the PM was quoted as saying. “We are grateful to our great and long-standing friend and strategic partner, China, for this exemplary collaboration.\n\n“The hearts of Pakistanis beat with the Chinese people and leadership,” he added.\n\nAccording to the statement, the satellite will help Pakistan research environmental changes and geographical variations.\n\n“This progress will prove to be an important milestone in combating the harmful effects of climate change,” PM Shehbaz said. “The satellite will significantly increase national capabilities in areas such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, urban planning and disaster management.”\n\nSeparately, in a statement issued today, the foreign office termed the development a major milestone and called it “a pivotal step forward in Pakistan’s space programme.”\n\nFO said that the launch “reaffirms Suparco’s commitment to leveraging space technology for national development.”\n\nIt also “highlights the long-standing collaboration between Pakistan and China in the peaceful exploration of space and its application for socioeconomic progress.”\n\n“Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar commended the scientists/technical teams from Pakistan and China working on HS-1 for their commitment, professional excellence and exemplary cooperation,” the statement said.\n\nOn October 15, Suparco announced the upcoming launch of the HS-1 satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Centre in China.\n\nLast month, a senior official from Suparco said the agency was integrating space-based applications into its disaster risk management framework, “paving a path anchored in science and international collaboration to better prepare for natural calamities”.\n\nIn July, the foreign ministry announced the successful launch of a remote sensing satellite from China, which aimed to “strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities”.\n\nIn August, Pakistan successfully launched a remote sensing satellite from a launch centre in China. The satellite aimed to strengthen Pakistan’s agricultural monitoring and disaster management, among other capabilities, according to a Foreign Office statement.\n\nPAKISTAN\n   \n0\nRead more\nPakistan successfully launches remote sensing satellite: foreign ministry\nUse of space tech to help with disaster management\nPakistan’s satellite reaches orbit, begins operations\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n \n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\n \nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\n \nCan International Law Stop Wars?\n \nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\n \nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\n \nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\n \nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\n \nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles",
