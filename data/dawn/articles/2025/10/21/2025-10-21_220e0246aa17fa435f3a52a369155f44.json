The accord, emphasising mutual res­pect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, was welcomed by investors as a sign of improving regional stability and potential economic cooperation.\\n\\nAccording to Topline Securities Ltd, the week opened on a strong note as the bulls dominated the trading floor, propelling the index to an impressive intraday gain of 2,615 points before closing at 166,242, up 2,436 points or 1.49 per cent.\\n\\nBanking heavyweights led the charge, with Habib Bank, United Bank, Bank of Punjab, National Bank, and Askari Bank, collectively contributing 989 points to the index’s rally. Broader market sentiment remained buoyant throughout the session, as investors poured into equities across multiple sectors.\\n\\nMarket participation weakened as the trading volume fell 25.27pc to 1.47 billion shares. However, the traded value surged 40.22pc to Rs51.8bn.

The session began on a cautious note, extending some of Friday’s selling pressure with the index slipping to an intraday low of 164,282 points (0.29pc). However, value hunters swiftly entered the market at lower levels, reversing sentiment and igniting a broad-based rally.\\n\\nOn the macroeconomic front, Pakistan posted a current account surplus of $110 million in September compared to a $52m deficit in the same month last year and a $325m deficit in August. The session marked a powerful comeback for the bulls, as optimism returned to the trading floor as its again entered into 165,000-170,000 consolidation zone, led by financial heavyweights and supported by improving macro indicators.\\n\\nPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2025",
