They said they hoped they could get Sarkozy freed on early release by Christmas.\n\nSarkozy to be held in isolation unit\n\nSarkozy will likely be held in La Sante’s isolation unit, where inmates are housed in single cells and kept apart during outdoor activities for security reasons.\n\nConditions are similar to the rest of the prison: cells measure 9 to 12 square metres and, following renovations, now include private showers.\n\nSarkozy will have access to a television — for a monthly fee of 14 euros ($16) — and a landline telephone.\n\nSarkozy told Le Figaro he would take three books for his first week behind bars, including Alexandre Dumas’ The Count of Monte Cristo — the story of a man who is unjustly imprisoned and who plots his revenge against those who betrayed him.\n\nThe decision to jail a former president has sparked outrage among Sarkozy’s political allies and the far right.\n\n“Nicolas Sarkozy is not a criminal,” said Sarkozy supporter Jacqueline Fraboulet, who was among the crowd cheering him on Tuesday. “We actually feel like the justice system is taking the power, and that’s not good for France.”\n\nSarkozy’s children and brothers also attended the gathering. Sarkozy, looking sombre, waved at his supporters before heading into his car for the journey to La Sante.\n\nFrance gets tougher on white-collar crime\n\nThe sentencing reflected a shift in France’s approach to white-collar crime. In the 1990s and 2000s, many convicted politicians avoided prison altogether.\n\nDespite his legal troubles, Sarkozy’s political influence has proved resilient as French society has shifted to the right.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron, who had warm relations with Sarkozy and Bruni, said on Monday he had met Sarkozy ahead of his incarceration. Justice Minister Gerald Darmanin said he would visit him in prison.\n\nThat angered left-wing politicians who said Macron and Darmanin were breaching judicial independence.\n\nThe son of a Hungarian immigrant, Sarkozy became president in 2007, pledging to shake things up with pro-business reforms that would reinvigorate France’s stagnant economy and elevate the country to the top table of global players.\n\nThose efforts were quickly upended by the 2008-2009 economic crisis, and voters gave him little credit for raising the retirement age to 62 from 60 and loosening rules requiring a maximum 35-hour work week.\n\nWORLD\n   \n0\nRead more\nSarkozy handed 5-year jail term in stunning downfall\nSarkozy on trial over alleged Qadhafi pact\nCourt orders former French president Sarkozy to wear electronic tag\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nWhen Breathing Becomes a Privilege: Pakistan’s Fight for Climate Justice\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market",
