Pramedasa International Stadium in Colombo, Sri Lanka on October 21. — PCB\n1x\n1.2x\n1.5x\nJOIN OUR WHATSAPP CHANNEL\n\nRain continues to erode Pakistan’s flickering hopes of reaching the semi-finals of the ICC Women’s World Cup, this time arriving just two overs into their crucial fixture against already-qualified South Africa.\n\nHaving seen their last two matches being washed out, Pakistan need to win at Colombo’s R. Premadasa Stadium on Tuesday to keep alive their chances of a last-four finish in the league stage.\n\nHowever, Fatima Sana’s side were back in the dugout as soon as the match began, after having won the toss and elected to field, as the heavens opened up. And now begins their wait to see if the match will resume.\n\nMoments before the players took cover, Fatima had given Pakistan the start they were looking for when she had Tazmin Brits caught at first slip for a duck, with South Africa at 6-1 after the first 12 balls.\n\nThe Pakistani skipper continued her knack of getting early breakthroughs when she got the dangerous Brits to knick an away swinger to Natalia Parvaiz at first slip.\n\nIn a tournament affected by the monsoon rains, the weather in Colombo was overcast at the start of play.\n\nSpeaking at the toss, Pakistan captain Fatima said: “It looks like a good pitch for the bowlers and the weather is good, so we’ll bowl first.”\n\nPakistan are unchanged since their last rained out encounter.\n\nGoing into their penultimate group match of the tournament, the Women in Green still have an outside chance of making the semi-finals despite still searching for their first win.\n\nBowler Rameen Shamim said on Monday that although the weather was out of their control, the team was trying their best to make the semi-finals.\n\nMonsoon rains in Colombo have seen Pakistan’s last two matches end in washouts against England and New Zealand, respectively, costing the team a chance to pick up more points in their last-four push.\n\nThe washed-out New Zealand fixture on Saturday saw South Africa become the second team to qualify for the semi-finals of the tournament, with the Green Shirts still searching for their first win.\n\nThe Green Shirts played a home series in Lahore in September against the Proteas, where they lost the first two games before beating the visitors in the final ODI on a spin-friendly track.\n\nThey also faced each other in a World Cup practice match in Colombo ahead of the tournament itself, where the Proteas won by four wickets.\n\nSouth African pacer Masabata Klaas also alluded to the challenge Pakistan posed going into the encounter.\n\n“Oh, obviously Pakistan is [a] strong team. We cannot just go there and think that we’re just going to walk in the park. But then one thing that’s going to work for us is to stick to basics and do what we’ve been doing from day one of the World Cup,” the right-arm medium pacer said.\n\nShe added that her side would not be taking the Green Shirts for granted.\n\nThe Proteas go into the clash with a result in a rain-affected encounter in Colombo against Sri Lanka — where they won by 10 wickets in a 20-over contest.\n\nFor Pakistan, their skipper Fatima’s form with the ball has been a positive going into this must-win encounter. The right-arm pacer has taken nine wickets at an outstanding average of 16 so far.\n\nThe Women in Green will also be looking for the weather to relent in the Sri Lankan capital, which caused their pre-match practice session to be moved indoors yet again — at an alternate venue near the Sinhalese Sports Club.\n\nTeams:\n\nPakistan: Omaima Sohail, Muneeba Ali, Sidra Amin, Aliya Riaz, Natalia Pervaiz, Fatima Sana (captain), Sidra Nawaz (wicketkeeper), Rameen Shamim, Diana Baig, Nashra Sandhu, and Sadia Iqbal.\n\nSouth Africa: Laura Wolvaardt (capt), Tazmin Brits, Sune Luus, Marizanne Kapp, Annerie Dercksen, Chloe Tryon, Nadine de Klerk, Karabo Meso (wk), Nondumiso Shangase, Ayabonga Khaka, and Nonkululeko Mlaba.\n\nWOMEN'S WORLD CUP 2025\nSPORT\n   \n0\nRead more\nWeather out of our control but trying our best to make the semis, says Rameen ahead of South Africa clash\nRain plays spoilsport yet again as Pakistan-New Zealand World Cup encounter ends in washout\nPakistan still looking forward to semi-final chance, says Omaima ahead of New Zealand World Cup clash\nOn DawnNews\nمونسٹر سیریز: اپنے سفاک جرائم سے امریکی معاشرے کو بدلنے والا ایڈ گین کون تھا؟\n’بھٹو صاحب کو جب تک بلوچستان آپریشن کی غلطی کا احساس ہوا، بہت دیر ہوچکی تھی‘\nبدلتے ہوئے عالمی منظرنامے میں پاکستان اچانک اتنا اہم کیوں ہوگیا ہے؟\nDAWN NEWS ENGLISH \nSubscribe\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles\nASEAN Summit: Everything You Need To Know\nCan International Law Stop Wars?\nPakistan-Afghanistan Conflict Analysis\nTTP, Afghanistan & India: Inside Pakistan’s Shifting Security Strategy\nEx-Ukraine Minister Kuleba Doubts Trump-Putin Meeting Will End War\nFrom Power to EVs: HUBCO’s CEO on Fixing Pakistan’s Energy Market\nImpact of Tomahawks Not ‘Decisive’, Expert Warns, as Trump and Zelensky Set to Talk Missiles",
