  "content": "PESHAWAR: The Ayub Teaching Hospital in Abbottabad has become the second medical teaching institution in the province after the Hayatabad Medical Complex in Peshawar to launch free cancer treatment for patients from Hazara division, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nThe free cancer treatment was launched at the Hayatabad Medical Complex in 2013. Initially the treatment was available for blood cancer but three years later, it was extended to all types of cancers.\n\nChairman of the Board of Governors at the ATH Prof Abid Jameel told Dawn that the newly-established cancer ward and pharmacy would provide investigative services and treatment to patients free of charge.\n\n“Patients will get services regardless of their financial status. Not only will we provide services to patients but awareness sessions will also be organised to convince people to contact the right doctor at the right time to diagnose the disease at the initial stage when patients stand better chances of recovery,” he said.\n\nPatients from Hazara, AJK and GB to benefit from initiative\n\nProf Abid, a former head of the oncology department at the HMC, said that the newly-established 30-bed ward at Abbottabad would admit and diagnose patients and provide medicines.\n\n“The government will be spending Rs250 million a year on the treatment of around 600 patients. Later, the government may increase the amount,” he said.\n\nAccording to the board chairman, there are two oncologists with all facilities required for cancer treatment.\n\n“This initiative will benefit not only the residents of Hazara but also patients from Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, who previously had to travel to Peshawar for treatment,” he said.\n\nHe said the hospital administration remained committed to further enhancing this facility, ensuring quality care and compassionate support for patients in the region.\n\nProf Abid, who pioneered the free cancer treatment programme at HMC where 10,000 patients have so far been treated, said that expansion of services to other hospitals was needed as it was hard for patients to visit Peshawar every month and undergo tests and get medicines.\n\nHe said the government had already decided to extend the programme to all hospitals in the province with oncologists, as it’s difficult for cancer patients from all over the province to visit HMC for consultation, diagnosis and medicines.\n\nUntil now, around Rs10 billion expenses on free treatment of cancer patients have been utilised at the HMC, according to him.\n\nProf Abidsaid the cancer treatment was highly expensive and even the affluent people couldn’t afford it.\n\nAt HMC, blood cancer patients are treated with 85 per cent cure rate, while the percentage for all cancers is around 70, which matches international standards, according toProf Abid, who established the oncology department there.\n\nHe said currently, mortality from cancer was high as most patients visited hospitals only after their disease reached the third stage in which the chances of treatment were very low.\n\n“It’s a government programme for all patients, so the hospital can’t deny treatment to those with the final stage of cancer. It began treatment to prolong their lifespan by one to two years. In many cases, patients require lifelong treatment even if they survive,” he said.\n\nThe board chairman said patients had to visit Peshawar every month for follow-up treatment and medicines, which was difficult for them, especially those from faraway areas.\n\n“Now, patients will come to Abbottabad,” he said,adding that the government deserves appreciation for the initiative.\n\nProf Abid said cancer treatment was costly and lasted long, so patients required regular medication for which they needed hospital in the vicinity.\n\nOncologists said that 20 per cent of blood cancer patients treated at HMC were children, with each treatment costing between Rs500,000 and Rs1 million or even more.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 11th, 2025",
