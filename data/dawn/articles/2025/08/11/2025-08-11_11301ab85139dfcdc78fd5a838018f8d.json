  "content": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Terrorists blew up a government high school building in Birmal tehsil of Lower South Waziristan early on Sunday, the police said.\n\nBirmal circle DSP Asghar Ali Shah told Dawn on phone that terrorists planted explosives along the school’s boundary wall as well as inside the premises before fleeing the scene in Qara Bagh area of Azam Warsak.\n\nThe blast, he said caused severe damage to the boundary wall and also destroyed several classrooms.\n\nPolice have started investigation into the incident.\n\nAccording to a local, two separate explosions occurred — one targeting the high school building and the other hitting the under-construction higher secondary school portion. He said the latter structure had not yet been completed and was partially destroyed in the attack.\n\nDSP Shah said that mobile and internet services in Birmal remain suspended, creating serious communication difficulties and hampering flow of initial information. Despite these challenges, he said police teams were collecting evidence to determine those responsible.\n\nThe school had previously been targeted in a similar bombing a few years ago.\n\nLocals expressed concern over the latest attack, with parents and teachers voicing fears for safety of their children and continuity of educational activities in the area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 11th, 2025",
