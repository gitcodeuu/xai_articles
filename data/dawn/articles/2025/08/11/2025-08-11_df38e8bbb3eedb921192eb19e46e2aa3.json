In a country where the workers are deprived of their basic rights, claims of development by the government are futile. The development is only visible in government advertisements.”\n\nSalman Akram Raja said millions of workers were jobless. He called the PTI a party of the toiling masses and announced that it would stand by the workers in every protest to raise their voice.\n\nJoins Faisalabad workers gathering in support of their demand for rights\n\n“The powerloom factories have been closed by the owners and the district administration should bring both the workers and the owners to the table to resolve their issues through negotiations.”\n\nLabour leaders Umar Dar, Baba Latif Ansari, Aslam Meraj, Parveen Latif, Rana Riaz, Malik Mumtaz and Sheikh Nisar also spoke.\n\nHOUSE FIRE: Six members of a family were critically burnt after a fire broke out due to a gas leak at a house in Himmatpura locality of Faisalabad at night.\n\nRescue 1122 said the family returned home from the outing and as soon as they opened the door of their room and switched on the light bulb, a spark caused a heavy gas explosion.\n\nAs a result, a fire broke out in the room due to massive accumulation of leaked gas which engulfed all of them. They received critical burns and were shifted to the burn unit of Allied Hospital.\n\nThose injured were identified as Zunaira Bibi (53), Ghazala (22), Muhammad Usman (30), Sidra (31), Arham (2) and Zurrain (1).\n\nACCIDENT: A woman died after a speeding car hit a motorcycle at Gojra near M-4 interchange on Jhang Road.
