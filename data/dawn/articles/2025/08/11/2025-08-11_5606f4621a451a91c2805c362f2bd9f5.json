  "content": "LONDON: Crystal Palace twice came from behind to stun a new-look Liverpool and win the Community Shield for the first time on penalties after a 2-2 draw at Wembley on Sunday.\n\nNew signings Hugo Ekitike and Jeremie Frimpong scored for the Premier League champions, but Palace responded through Jean-Philippe Mateta and Ismaila Sarr before winning an error-strewn shootout 3-2.\n\nMohamed Salah blazed over from the spot, while Alexis Mac Allister and Harvey Elliott were denied by an inspired Dean Henderson as Palace built on winning their first ever major trophy by beating Manchester City in May’s FA Cup final.\n\nThe traditional curtain-raiser to the English football season was given extra significance after a summer marked by tragedy for Liverpool.\n\nForward Diogo Jota was killed in a car accident alongside his brother Andre Silva.\n\nReds legend Ian Rush and Palace chairman Steve Parish laid wreaths on the side of the pitch before kick-off, while the Liverpool end was awash with banners and flags paying tribute to the Portuguese international.\n\nA minute’s silence, however, had to be cut short due to disturbances in the crowd.\n\nJota’s death has dampened the excitement over Liverpool’s transfer spending spree to build on a squad that romped to a record-equalling 20th league title last season.\n\nAll four of their new signings at a cost of 260 million ($350 million) — Ekitike, Florian Wirtz, Frimpong and Milos Kerkez — started.\n\nEkitike’s role this season could depend on whether Liverpool are successful in their pursuit of Newcastle striker Alexander Isak.\n\nBut the Frenchman — signed from Eintracht Frankfurt last month for an initial 69 million — did his case to be Slot’s preferred number nine no harm at all.\n\nWirtz also bagged his first assist for the Reds when Ekitike spun onto the German’s pass and fired into the far corner just four minutes.\n\nPalace were making their first ever appearance in the fixture but the Eagles again showed their ability to match one of the Premier League’s giants over 90 minutes.\n\nMateta missed a glorious cha­nce to level when he failed to beat Alisson Becker when one-on-one.\n\nLIVERPOOL UNBALANCED\n\nBut from the rebound Sarr charged into the box and was tripped by an out-of-sorts Virgil van Dijk. Mateta coolly sent Alisson the wrong way from the penalty spot to equalise.\n\nLiverpool’s players were sporting a “Forever 20” emblem, referencing Jota’s now-retired shirt number, that they will wear all season.\n\nThe Liverpool fans had risen to chant Jota’s name as the game entered the 20th minute when their side retook the lead Frimp­ong’s chipped cross caught out Henderson and flew into the far corner.\n\nEkitike wasted a great chance for his second early in the second half from another Wirtz pass as this time he fired over.\n\nHowever, Slot’s new-look side are still to find the right balance between attack and defence as has been evidenced during pre-season.\n\nPalace were a constant threat with balls in behind the Reds defence and levelled again 13 minutes from time.\n\nSarr sped onto Adam Whar­ton’s through ball and calmly slotted past Alisson for his fourth goal in seven games against Liverpool.\n\nLiverpool also survived a VAR review for a penalty against Mac Allister for handball before the match went to a shootout without extra-time.\n\nYoungster Justin Devenny was the unlikely hero as he blasted the winning spot-kick high past Alisson, showing Salah, Mac Allister and Elliott how it is done.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 11th, 2025",
