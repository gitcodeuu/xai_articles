  "content": "The sighting of a rare Bengal fox (Vulpes bengalensis) near Rasoolpur village has causedexcitement among nature lovers and wildlife researchers.\n\nThe rare fox, seen alone, belongs to a species that is disappearing fast due to habitat loss and climate change.\n\nThe Bengal fox is a shy, mostly nocturnal animal and an expert hunter. The female fox’s pregnancy period is 50–60 days and it gives birth to only three to four pups in a litter, making it more vulnerable.\n\n“This is more than just a sighting—it’s a warning,” says Umer Waqas, a zoologist and environmentalist from Rasoolpur, a village known for its 100 percent literacy rate.\n\n“If we don’t protect these animals and their habitat, they could disappear completely,” he warned, urging people not to harm them or disturb their natural environment.\n\nWildlife experts say this sighting is an important record, showing the species still survives in some areas. Conservationists urge quick action by both the authorities and the public to protect the remaining fox population.\n\nFor Umer Waqas, the sighting is a moment to celebrate nature’s strength but also a reminder of how delicate it is.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 11th, 2025",
