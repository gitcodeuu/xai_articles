We expected from the provincial government and district administration to provide free transport to us in this difficult time, but the government had failed to do so,“ they added.\n\nSome fleeing residents also complained of being overcharged by transporters with fares reportedly much higher than usual.\n\n’’A driver demanded Rs20,000 for a trip from Inam Khooro Chinagi to Sheikh Kalley in Khar tehsil, Rs16,000 more than the normal fare,“ said Haidar Khan.\n\nThere is no official count of the people displaced from their native areas over the past two days, but NGOs said around 2,000 families have been displaced since Saturday.\n\nTaking to Dawn, they said that around 1,000 families have registered with their relief camps while as many families have shifted to other places without registration.\n\nSources in the district administration and NGOs said that most of the displaced people had relocated within the district, with some taking shelter in homes, educational institutions and government buildings.\n\nA district administration official told Dawn on Sunday, that 107 educational institutions, mostly in Khar tehsil, have been designated as shelters for displaced people, offering basic facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the district administration made arran­gements on Sunday to accommodate displaced persons with basic facilities.\n\nAccording to a statement, the arrangements were finalised during a meeting of senior officials of the district administration with the representatives of NGOs in Khar.\n\nIt said the meeting was presided over by Assistant Commissioner Dr Sadiq Ali.\n\nIt further said that necessary directions were issued to participants of the meeting. The participants were told to make proper arrangements for the displaced families, adjusting them with their relatives, government facilities, private schools and at the sports stadium.\n\nThe meeting requested to the heads of NGOs to strengthen coordination to help maximum number of people in different areas.\n\nThe meeting also instructed the officials of the district education department, principals of colleges and private school owners to manage the influx of the families on priority basis.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 11th, 2025",
