  "content": "GILGIT: Climate cha­nge-driven disasters continued to batter Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) where a glacial lake outburst flood (Glof) from the Shishper Glacier tore through Hassanabad Nullah, swee­ping away part of the Karakoram Highway and destroying public and private properties.\n\nOfficials described the event as the most severe in the area since 2018. “The volume of today’s flood was the highest in the Nullah since 2018,” said Zubair Ahmed Khan, assistant director of the Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Disaster Mana­ge­ment Authority (GBDMA) for Hunza and Nagar.\n\nThe flood severed the main road link for much of Hunza’s population, with traffic diverted via the Sas Valley Road from Murtazabad, he said.\n\nThe torrent, fuelled by accelerated glacier melt, ripped through agricultural land, uprooted trees and damaged public and private property.\n\nHouses damaged in Hassanabad\n\nIn Hassanabad, residents were left counting the cost. “The flood eroded land near multiple homes and put more than 50 houses near Hassanabad Nullah at risk,” Saleem Bercha, a local resident, told Dawn.\n\n“Several homes have developed cracks. Ten houses were dismantled recently to try to save them from the water,” he added.\n\nThis latest destruction follows a similar Glof last month that damaged four homes and swathes of farmland.\n\nAuthorities said Sunday’s disaster struck after the Shishper Glacier’s water discharge was blocked for around an hour before bursting through, obliterating protective walls and damaging irrigation and drinking-water channels to Aliabad and nearby villages.\n\nElsewhere in GB, flash floods triggered by heavy glacier melt surged through Supultar Nullah in Nagar Khas, blocking the Hoper Valley road and cutting off a popular tourist destination.\n\nThe flood damaged irrigation systems, destroyed a bridge and severed the Hisper Valley road in Tokorkot village, where several homes are now under threat.\n\nIn Hunza’s Shimshal Valley, rising river levels damaged the only access road and the protective walls safeguarding it.\n\nAcross the region, restoration work on irrigation and water supply systems wrecked by recent cloudbursts, flash floods and Glofs remains stalled. Communities are facing acute shortages of drinking and irrigation water.\n\nIn Danyor, residents said the destruction of main water channels had left thousands without water.\n\n“Crops and trees have dried up,” a resident said.\n\nVolunteers are now working to repair the damage, as communities here depend almost entirely on glacier-fed water for survival.\n\nExperts warn that unprecedented high temperatures and repeated heatwaves this year have accelerated glacier melt, making Glofs and extreme flooding more frequent.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 11th, 2025",
