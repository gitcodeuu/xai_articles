He died instantly.\n\nPolice responded swiftly, cordoning off the market and launched a search operation. “An investigation has been initiated, and efforts are underway to apprehend those responsible,” DPO Shah stated.\n\nThe body of the slain officer was moved to the District Headquarters Hospital, Wana, for a postmortem examination, as part of the formal legal proceedings.\n\nThe daylight killing has triggered a wave of concern among residents, with calls for enhanced security measures in public and commercial areas.\n\nMeanwhile, on the directives of deputy commissioner Musarrat Zaman, a team of the district administration officials carried out a series of field visits in Wana on Saturday.\n\nThe visits were conducted by additional assistant commissioner, Wana, Mohammad Arif, accompanied by the assistant food controller, livestock department in-charge and TMA officials.\n\nThe AAC attended a teacher training workshop, which highlighted the need for professional development of teachers to strengthen the local education system.\n\n“Skilled and trained teachers are the backbone of quality education,” said Mr Arif during his address to the participants.\n\nDuring an inspection of bakeries in Wana Bazaar, several outlets were found selling underweight bread. The owners were served with strict warnings.\n\nThe team also inspected various food outlets and grocery stores, identifying poor hygiene conditions and weight discrepancies. On-the-spot penalties were imposed, and shopkeepers were directed to improve cleanliness and comply with quality standards.\n\nAAC Arif, along with the food department officials, also visited flour retailers and storage facilities to review pricing and stock management.\n\nShopkeepers were reminded to sell at government-notified rates. A government wheat stock was also inspected for pest control and hygiene compliance, and cleanliness warnings were issued where necessary.\n\nLocal residents expressed appreciation for the district administration’s efforts and called for regular enforcement to ensure transparency, fair pricing, and improved service delivery in the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
