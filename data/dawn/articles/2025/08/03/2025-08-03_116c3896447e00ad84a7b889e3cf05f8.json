  "content": "ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari has directed the federal government to pay all withheld dues to Muhammad Arshad Khan Jadoon, the chairman of Pakistan’s Press Council (PPC), ending his seven-month legal battle to receive a salary.\n\nAs the head of PPC — the regulator of print media — Mr Jadoon was entitled to a salary equivalent to that of a Supreme Court judge.\n\nHowever, in January, he was stripped of these benefits and the government downgraded his pay scale to Management Position-1 or MP-1 without legal justification, according to documents seen by Dawn.\n\nMr Jadoon contested the decision on the grounds that his predecessors received higher salaries and filed an application with the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Federal Ombudsman) in May.\n\nSays decision to downgrade pay scale was ‘maladministration’, ‘discriminatory’\n\nHe alleged the government’s action violated past presidential orders and was unconstitutional and discriminatory.\n\nThe ombudsman acknowledged “clear maladministration” by the Ministry of Information but dismissed Mr Jaddon’s plea citing service matter restrictions under Article 9(2) of the Establishment of the Office of Wafaqi Mohtasib (Ombudsman) Order, 1983.\n\nThe said section states the ombudsman cannot accept any complaint filed by a public servant on “any matter relating to the Agency in which he is, or has been, working in respect of any personal grievance relating to his service”.\n\nMr Jadoon challenged the decision before the president.\n\nUnder the law, appeals can be filed against the ombudsperson’s decision before the president. At the Presidency, the advisor/legal consultant examines the matter and issues orders with the president’s approval.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nIn his judgement, the presidency’s legal affairs consultant, retired justice Irfan Qadir, said the decision to downgrade Mr Jadoon’s pay scale was a “gross maladministration” by federal ministries.\n\nThe decision, and the direction to pay Mr Jadoon’s dues, have been approved by President Asif Ali Zardari.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Mr Jadoon stated his salary was stopped and he didn’t even receive his dues even after an open-heart surgery.\n\n“Even my medical and utility bills were denied. I paid them from my own pocket while heading a federal institution,” he added.\n\nHis counsel, Advocate Ziaullah Khan, argued the ombudsman refu­sed Mr Jadoon’s appeal on the grounds of “service matter” restriction. “Stopping salary isn’t a service matter. It’s financial strangulation,” he argued.\n\nHe said the government’s action was tantamount to “indirect removal from office”, violating articles 4, 24, 25, and 2A of the Constitution.\n\nDuring a hearing on June 12, the information ministry’s legal director, Dr Sohail Aftab, conceded Mr Jadoon had a legal right to the higher salary.\n\nThe finance ministry’s representative, Khalid Zia, admitted the decision ignored Press Council Ordinance 2002 and Rules of 2013 — which mandate judge-level pay. He offered no defence for stopping the salary, calling it “legally indefensible”.\n\nThe Presidency declared there was no legal basis to stop the salary as it can only be withheld as a penalty for misconduct, which was not the case here.\n\nThe order highlighted violations of Articles 4 (right to dignity), 24 (property rights), and 25 (equality) of the Constitution.\n\nIt said the action was in “bad faith” and “discrimination” against Mr Jadoon as his predecessors received a judge-level salary.\n\nPresident Zardari ordered “immediate payment” of all arrears along with interest.\n\nHe also approved reimbursement of medical/utility bills paid by Mr Jadoon and ordered legal action against the responsible officials under Efficiency and Discipline Rules.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
