Also, the government’s hesitation to embrace GMOs over potential health concerns further slowed progress.\n\nAccording to CropLife officials, integrated pest management, robotics and digital farming, gene editing, seed and biotechnology policies, improved soil and water management, crop protection and climate-resilient seeds were solutions to overcome the agri sector’s challenges.\n\nThese innovations were crucial to boost productivity, ensuring food security, and building resilience against climate change, the committee was told.\n\nThe meeting highlighted the seed policy had been pending before the Ministry of National Food Security and Research for a long time. It urged the officials to forward the policy to the Prime Minister’s Office for approval.\n\nOn the issue of taxing cotton, the Federal Board of Revenue informed the committee that GST will be imposed on imported cotton from August 15.\n\nThis long-awaited step, recommended by the committee, aimed to create parity between imported and locally produced cotton. The move is expected to stabilise domestic cotton prices and support local growers, according to FBR.\n\nA Statutory Regulatory Order notifying the new tax would be issued next Tuesday, the committee was told.\n\nTobacco sector\n\nThe committee also discussed the challenges faced by tobacco growers and called for a comprehensive policy framework to address the issues.\n\nThe members were briefed on the current tobacco taxation policy, the framework for collection and utilisation of the CESS fund over the past ten years, the PTB’s corporate social responsibility initiatives and a potential crop insurance scheme.\n\nThe PTB secretary briefed on actions taken in response to the committee’s previous recommendations to resolve long-standing challenges faced by tobacco growers.\n\nThe meeting was told a fund of Rs949 million allocated for research and development in the tobacco sector remains unutilised as the position of the PTB director was vacant.\n\nA representative of toabccor growers said farmers were facing difficulties in selling their crops.\n\nThe committee directed the food secretary to implement meaningful reform and consult the growers on issues related to the tobacco sector.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
