They said even if the jirga agreed to a fresh anti-terror operation, there should be written assurances that no such offensive would take place in the future and militancy would be eliminated once and for all.\n\nIn response to their stance against the military action, the CM asked them for alternative options to restore peace in their districts. A tribal elder said even the CM appeared to be against military actions, but sought public support to resist any such plans.\n\nAbout this claim, KP CM’s information aide Bar­rister Saif told Dawn the CM required public support for such actions, as in de­­mocratically elected governments, such support was crucial.\n\nAccording to another jirga member, the government suggested they meet the Taliban and ask them to move out of their areas.\n\nLike the previous jirga, the CM allegedly wanted to issue a declaration following the meeting, but the members opposed it, saying it should be issued after consultations with delegations from all tribal districts facing militancy. Barrister Saif, however, denied that the CM was in favour of releasing a declaration.\n\nAnother participant said it was proposed that following the grand jirga, which will be held after the district-level jirga, a smaller delegation representing all tribal districts call on military leadership.\n\n‘Not acceptable’\n\nSeparately, a statement issued by CM Secretariat read that the jirga recommended that military operations and the displacement of local populations would not be acceptable under any circumstances.\n\nAccording to the statement, the tribal elders recommended that the federal government arrange a delegation, comprising representatives of the provincial government and tribal elders, to engage in dialogue with Afghanistan and provide necessary support and resources to facilitate this process.\n\nIt was also announced that the next regional jirga would focus on the Moh­­mand and Bajaur districts, followed by a third jirga covering North and South Waziristan, and the final regional jirga would be held for the restive Kurram district.\n\nAfter all the regional jirgas, a grand jirga will be convened under the leadership of the KP chief minister.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
