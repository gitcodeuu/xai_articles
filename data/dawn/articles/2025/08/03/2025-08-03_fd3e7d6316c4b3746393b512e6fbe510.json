  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Azerbaijan have agreed to establish a joint trade company to promote imports, exports and joint business ventures.\n\nThe initiative is expected to help strengthen industrial linkages and increase the volume of bilateral trade.\n\nThe decision was made during a visit by the Azeri ambassador to Pakistan, Khazar Farhadov, to the Azerbaijan-Pakistan Chamber of Commerce.\n\nAmbassador Farhadov highlighted that both countries’ leadership — President Ilham Aliyev and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif — were committed to further strengthening these ties.\n\nRelations between Pakistan and Azerbaijan are based on mutual trust, brotherhood and shared interests, Mr Farhadov said.\n\nUnited Business Group (UBG) Secretary General Zafar Bakhtawari, Azerbaijan-Pakistan Chamber of Commerce Chairman Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari, Chakwal Chamber former president Waqar Bakhtawari, Azerbaijan Trade House President Adeel Butt and other business personalities were also present on the occasion.\n\nAmbassador Farhadov emphasised that the role of the private sector is crucial in elevating economic and trade cooperation between the two countries to new heights. “Azerbaijan not only welcomes Pakistani traders and investors but also offers them market access, facilitation and excellent investment opportunities,” he added.\n\nThe ambassador highlighted the increase in air connectivity between the two countries as a positive development — with four weekly flights from Lahore and two from Islamabad — which will enhance people-to-people and commercial exchanges.\n\nMr Ahsan stated that he plans to visit Baku in August, while Mr Zafar will lead a high-level trade delegation in September to explore practical avenues of collaboration in potential sectors.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr Butt said that during his stay in Azerbaijan, he closely observed various trade opportunities and saw opportunities for cooperation in key sectors such as road trade, logistics, energy, agriculture, information technology, tourism and textiles.\n\nHe emphasised that partnerships in these areas will not only strengthen trade ties but also open new chapters of friendship between the two countries. He further stressed that there is significant potential for Pakistani products in the Azerbaijani market, which, if leveraged properly, can lead to a substantial increase in exports.\n\nMr Waqar appreciated the efforts of the Azerbaijan-Pakistan Chamber of Commerce, describing it as an economic bridge between the two countries. He also thanked Ambassador Farhadov for his keen interest in fostering bilateral trade and cultural relations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
