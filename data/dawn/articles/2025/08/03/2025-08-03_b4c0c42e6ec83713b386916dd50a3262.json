He allowed newcomer Shamar Joseph a run that pulled West Indies within six runs with three balls remaining.\n\nHolder and Joseph each struck for singles and Afridi went wide to Holder, leaving West Indies three runs shy for the final delivery, setting the stage for Holder’s heroics.\n\nPakistan won the toss and batted first, going 133 for nine.\n\nHasan Nawaz led Pakistan on 40 with four sixes and a four while captain Salman Agha added 38 on one six and three fours.",
