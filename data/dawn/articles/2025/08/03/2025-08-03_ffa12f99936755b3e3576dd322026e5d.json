Elsewhere in the “eternal city”, numerous groups of young people were seen preparing to set off for the venue.\n\nOn the plaza outside the Basilica of St John Lateran, they filled water bottles, applied suncream and checked bags of food and snacks — ready to spend the next 24 hours surrounded by a swarm of people and then sleep under the stars.\n\nVictoria Perez, who carried a Spanish flag, could not contain her excitement at seeing “the Pope up close. “It’s the first time I’m going to see him, and I can’t wait,” the 21-year-old said, excited to experience the “night of prayers under the stars”.\n\nFrench pilgrim, Quentin Remaury, 26, said he had been inspired by the late Pope Francis’s rousing message to youth during a 2016 visit to Krakow, Poland. “Pope Francis told us to `get off your couches’, and that really gave me a boost,” he said.\n\n`What is his message?’\n\nSince the youth jubilee began on Monday, attendees have participated in various Church-planned events throughout the city.\n\nOn Friday, approximately 1,000 priests were on hand to take confession at Circus Maximus, one of Rome’s top tourist spots.\n\nSome 200 white gazebos lined the hippodrome where chariot races were once held and youths lined up to speak to priests in 10 different languages.\n\nOf the many languages heard on the streets of the Italian capital this week, Spanish seemed to dominate. The Vatican has said that more than 146 countries were represented and it expects up to a million people to attend the vigil.\n\nThe pilgrimage is taking place as economic uncertainty and anxiety over climate change rises among the under-30s, with many saying they were curious to hear the Church’s position on global warming, wars and economic inequalities.\n\nSamarei Semos, 29, said she had travelled three days from her native Belize to get to Rome.\n\n“We are still trying to understand his leadership,” she said of the new pope, adding she hoped he would have a strong say about “third world countries”.\n\nAs Parisian student Alice Berry exclaimed: “What does he have to say to us? What is his message for young people?”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
