Noting the low rate of conviction in rape cases (0.5pc according to a recent report), she said: “Who will they go to? System hi itna kharab hai, holnaak hai (the system itself is so broken and horrifying).”\n\n“The system has to be responsive,” Javeri stressed, noting the need for human rights impact assessments for projects and systematic and gendered planning in budgets.\n\nShe underscored that this aspect needed to be embedded in “service providers”, which include lawyers, courts, police and teachers, among others.\n\n“Human rights are god-given rights. Nobody can take them away.”\n\nJaveri detailed certain cases she had come across during her role at NCHR, including one where a woman had gotten her daughter — a Master’s student in her 30s — abducted and sent to a rehabilitation centre.\n\nThe mother’s reason to do so, as told by Javeri, sent shivers down the audience’s spines: the daughter did not want to get married, had cats as pets (as if that’s somehow relevant), and a so-called doctor termed her “depressed”.\n\nThe case, Javeri noted, highlighted how ill-equipped responders and people involved in dealing with such situations are. There is a lack of regulation of mental health cases, with every other person presenting themselves as psychologists, and anybody can term someone a “paagal” (mad).\n\nOther speakers on the panel were Police Service of Pakistan’s Superintendent (SP) Amna Baig; Karachi Bar Association Treasurer Haseebullah Panhwar; rights activist and academic Abira Ashfaq; and Air Commodore (retired) Shabbir Ahmed Khan, founder of Rashid Memorial Welfare Organisation. The session was moderated by Rana Kaiser Ishaque from the United Nations Development Programme in Pakistan.\n\nSP Baig, who was among the first responders who arrested Noor Mukadam’s murderer Zahir Jaffer from the crime scene, pointed out that the case was still being discussed four years later “because she was educated”, compared to other “worse cases” she had seen while serving in Punjab.\n\nWhile Baig believed that knowledge empowers people, she also noted that politicians and policymakers did not fully understand social equity.\n\n“If culture is repressive, it will be reflected in your public service systems, such as police,” she said, explaining that approaching a police station was linked to a woman’s dignity in Pakistan.\n\n“It’s how the police and law enforcement agencies have been portrayed over time. [But] there are women on the other side as well,” she assured the women attending the session, and suggested that it should be taught to people how to report to the police.\n\nThe police officer brought attention to a lesser-known term — tech-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV) — which not only means violence done using technology but also women being killed for even using social media platforms.\n\nAn image of a young girl that most people following the news have seen popped up in the audience’s minds; the recent murder of Sana Yousaf that rightly ignited fury among women across the country.\n\nAshfaq, a human rights activist and an associate professor at Habib University, took aim at the 26th Amendment, noting it had snatched away the suo motu power that had allowed judges to take notice of public issues.\n\nShe also underscored the lack of legal education: “We don’t know how courts, bureaucracy and parliamentary systems function. These are basic things. We haven’t gotten out of slogans to look at economic justice, climate justice.”\n\n“You have rolled back protective laws. We think about taxing property rather than thinking that housing is a right,” Ashfaq pointed out. Similarly, she wondered, “Where is the right to food?”\n\nMeanwhile, Panhwar, ready with his arguments, comprehensively but succinctly listed the troubles afflicting Pakistan’s judicial system.\n\nA serious matter, but an apt chuckle from the audience when the moderator quipped “Pakistan is also a hard state” as Panhwar described the category of local codes as “hard laws”.\n\nThe lawyer pointed out that Articles 8 to 28 of the Constitution guaranteed several rights such as freedom of expression and movement, and that Pakistan was a signatory to various international conventions, but “we do not see any kind of implementation at all here”.\n\nWithout any hesitation, Panhwar called out the “ruling parties” for bringing the 26th Amendment that now gave them more votes to decide who gets to be a judge in the superior courts.\n\nRetired Air Commodore Ahmed offered some words of wisdom, which one would want to blast on loudspeakers at public service institutions across the country.\n\nThe creation of Pakistan has given us complete independence, he said, but “we have denied and killed that over time through our actions and self-interest”.\n\nHe stressed, “If we are addressing a problem, then we must address it holistically.”\n\nThe retired officer also offered us, and Pakistan, hope: “All negative, all dark. But there is a silver lining; that we are talking about it.”",
