  "content": "TAXILA: Authorities have uncovered a possible link between the recently exposed donkey meat scandal in Tarnol Islamabad and a ‘donkey farm’ in Attock, and sealed it.\n\nAccording to official sources, the assistant commissioner of Attock accompanied by administration and security officials raided a farm in Akhori and found blood, bones and other remains of slaughtered donkeys, heightening concerns about a coordinated network allegedly involved in illegal slaughter of donkeys and distribution of its meat.\n\nInvestigators confirmed that donkeys from the Akhori facility were being transported to Tarnol, where authorities recently unearthed an illegal butchery and meat supply chain allegedly distributing donkey meat under the guise of legitimate products to local markets and eateries. Sources close to the inquiry said according to a tip provided by investigators in the Tarnol donkey meat scam, Akhori farm may have served as a key supplier.\n\nThe authorities were now exploring whether this network extends to other cities and whether any individuals are involved in exporting processed donkey meat under false labels.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Anza Abbassi, who led the raid, confirmed that some remains of butchered animals were found at the farm. She said that the farm was sealed for evidence and further investigation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
