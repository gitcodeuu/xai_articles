  "content": "RAHIM YAR KHAN: The ringleader of Indhar dacoits gang, Tanvir alias Dooda Indhar, has claimed the responsibility for the Thursday night attack on the Sheikhani police post (katcha area) which claimed the lives of five Elite Force personnel.\n\nIn a video message, Tanvir who carries Rs10m head money, said the police had betrayed his tribe over the issue of release of three Hindus (in their captivity) in return for Shabaan Indhar freedom. He said the day Shabaan was supposed to be freed by police, he was rather killed in an encounter.\n\n“So we killed five policemen in revenge for the killing of Shabaan who was in jail for the last five years,” Tanvir claimed in the video message. Sources said the Sheikhani police post was in poor condition. A viral picture shows the post was tent-shaped fiber umbrella resting on four steel pipes.\n\nAccording to some local residents of Nawazabad, Sangarpur and Chowk Mahi areas, the Shaikhani picket needed concrete structures and not fiber.\n\nPolice spokesperson Zeeshan Randhawa told Dawn that all the allegations levelled by Tanvir Indhar were false and baseless. He said Shabaan was a criminal involved in henious crimes and was killed in a police encounter.\n\nMeanwhile, Rajanpur police carried out a targeted operation against Katcha criminals, killing notorious gang leader, Najam alias Najmi Lund, who was wanted in numerous heinous cases. One dacoit was reported injured, says an official statement.\n\nPolice spokesperson said during an intelligence-based operation by the Rajanpur police, a fierce exchange of fire took place between the criminals and the police. “As a result, Najam Lund, a dacoit wanted for dozens of heinous crimes, including buffalo theft, murder and kidnapping for ransom, was killed. The body of the deceased dacoit was taken into police custody, and further legal action has begun.” He said police also set fire to criminals’ hideouts.\n\nIGP Dr. Usman Anwar praised Rajanpur police for their significant success against Katcha criminals. Rajanpur DPO Farooq Amjad said the success of the police operation was achieved through modern technology and a well-organized strategy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
