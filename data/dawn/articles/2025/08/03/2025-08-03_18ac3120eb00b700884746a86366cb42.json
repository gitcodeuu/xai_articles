He claimed that the custody issue was ‘amicably’ settled between the couple.\n\nLater, Alam, along with his wife and children, went to the food street at Burns Road for a lunch. Subsequently, he left the restaurant, saying he needed to go to the toilet. He took his children with him and did not return.\n\nMr Rameez said they had immediately informed the Madadgar-15 about that and also submitted an application before the Aram Bagh police to this effect.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
