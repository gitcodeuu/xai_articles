  "content": "YANGON: A Myanmar junta air strike on a rebel-occupied ruby mining hub killed 13 people on Saturday, according to a resident and a spokesperson for an armed opposition group.\n\nCivil war has consumed Myanmar since the military seized power in a 2021 coup, sparking resistance from pro-democracy guerrillas who found common cause with long-active ethnic armed groups.\n\nTheir scattered forces initially struggled to make headway, but a combined offensive starting in late 2023 seized swathes of territory, including the town of Mogok — the centre of the ruby trade.\n\nMyanmar is rich in precious stones and rare earth elements coveted by all factions and sold off, mostly to neighbouring China, to boost war chests. However, a local who declined to be named for security reasons said the strike took place around 08:15 am, killing seven instantly, with six dying later of their wounds.\n\nHe said among the dead were a Buddhist monk collecting alms and a father and son who were riding the same motorbike. “A car passing through the area was hit, too,” he added. “Seven people were wounded, including the driver.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
