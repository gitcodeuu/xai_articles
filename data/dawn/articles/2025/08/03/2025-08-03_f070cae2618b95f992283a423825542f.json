  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said it has developed an innovative nuclear technique with its partners to detect deadly and carcinogenic aflatoxins in pistachios faster, cheaper, and more effectively to make the popular nut safer for consumption worldwide.\n\nThe technique is being applied by more and more countries, the UN agency said in its weekly report.\n\nToday, pistachios are more popular than ever, with top producers including Iran, the US and Turkiye. As demand for pistachios rises, with over one million tonnes produced globally in 2022, so does concern over aflatoxins, chemical compounds produced by mold that can contaminate crops. Aflatoxins were discovered in 1960 and are classified as carcinogens, with long-term exposure linked to liver failure and tumours.\n\n“It is faster, cheaper and doesn’t require an entire lab,” said Christina Vlachou, head of the IAEA Food Safety and Control Laboratory (FSCL). “That means it can be used in the field, even during emergencies, and in countries that need it most.”\n\nInnovative nuclear technique offers cheaper, faster screening\n\nThe experts in FSCL, located in Seibersdorf, Austria, successfully compiled a toolbox to detect aflatoxins in low-resource settings.\n\nThe technique employs electrical conductors made from ceramic that are printed with carbon-based ink and contain a sensor to detect four different types of aflatoxins.\n\nWhen the sensor is inserted into a device called a Potentiostat, it sends a small electrical signal when aflatoxins are present, which can then be recorded using a mobile phone.\n\nThe method is sensitive enough to detect aflatoxins at concentrations 150 times lower than the allowed limit, according to the IAEA.\n\nThe method has been cross-validated with a confirmatory technique — the liquid chromatograph — tandem mass spectrometry.\n\nThe pistachio’s shell protects it from external contamination. But during ripening, this shell splits open, exposing it to moulds and insects, increasing the risk of aflatoxin formation and contamination.\n\nAflatoxins are generally invisible to the naked eye, but visible signs of mould on pistachios can include black or grey and black lesions or spots on the hulls or kernels.\n\nConventional testing for these toxins is expensive, time-consuming and requires highly skilled technicians and costly equipment.\n\nThe IAEA warned climate change is expected to accelerate the spread of contaminants like aflatoxins.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 3rd, 2025",
