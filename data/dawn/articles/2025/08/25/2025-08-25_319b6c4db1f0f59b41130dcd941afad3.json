The official said rescue teams, including police, were already on alert. Traffic was blocked, and pedestrians and residents were rescued and moved to safe places.\n\nHe added that a local pond in Kandala village overflowed, and the released water entered the village. The Pind Dadan Khan administration was carrying out dewatering operations in affected houses and streets.\n\nReferring to last week’s flash floods and rehabilitation activities in Lillah Sharif, the DC said that over 1,000 feet of water supply lines had been dismantled. Teams of engineers were working in day and night shifts to restore water supply to a dozen localities in the Salt Range belt, he said. Mr Abbas assured that the supply would be resumed within five days.\n\nHe said the current flash floods were being monitored. Meanwhile, a partially decomposed body of an unidentified woman, around 45 years old, was recovered from the Khurd Bela bank of the Jhelum River.\n\nThe body was shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital Jhelum by Rescue 1122.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
