  "content": "TEACHER certification is a formal process that ensures a certain standard of knowledge, skill and ethical conduct among educators for effective, sensitive and productive tutoring. The permit is crucial to maintaining educational quality, safeguarding student learning and competence as well as building a large, professional teaching workforce with essential academic qualifications and pedagogical training.\n\nA stringently implemented and robust procedure not only minimises the grave risks that unqualified individuals have long posed to students, it also promotes common professional standards across educational institutions. A licensing system builds public trust because the onus to uphold universally defined ethical and professional criteria is on the educators. Many licensing systems require continued education and periodic renewal, encouraging educators to stay updated in new research, technology and pedagogical strategies.\n\nWhile teacher licensing specifics vary from country to country, the general processes to qualify for a teaching licence include earning a degree in education with supervised teaching experience and the completion of an accredited teacher preparation programme. These programmes blend academic coursework with practical training in classroom management, curriculum design, assessment methods and instructional practices.\n\nThe licensing system falls short on many levels.\n\nAfter the submitted documentation is approved, a teaching licence is granted; it varies according to the qualifications of recruits and the grades they intend to teach, and is often valid for a limited period during which further training is needed. Following the successful completion of provisional requirements, a certificate is then issued for a longer term. Moreover, the fact that a background check should be made mandatory for students’ safety cannot be emphasised enough.\n\nDespite its importance, the licensing system falls short on many levels. The accreditation standards differ significantly, complicating teacher mobility and recruitment efforts. Some argue that the licensing process is overly bureaucratic and costly, which discourages talented individuals from joining the profession. Critics also assert that passing exams does not always correlate with classroom effectiveness and that experience and mentoring play a more critical role. In spite of this discontent, the system persists.\n\nAs education systems evolve, so should certification mechanisms because dedication and accessibility are crucial to a strong and diverse teaching fraternity. Globally, efforts are being made to modernise teacher authorisation. These include incentives to attract professionals from various fields to join education through fast-track programmes focused on specialised skills along with international recognition for licences to address scarcity and incompetence.\n\nPakistan did announce various national education policies for licensing schemes but these were not implemented. Sindh is the first province to introduce teacher licensing. The provincial government has established the Sindh Teacher Education Development Authority (STEDA), which is an autonomous body managed by a board of governors, for teacher certification. In order to develop a certification policy, a working committee comprising experts was also formed. The committee conducted several deliberations on developing a teacher licensing policy, which was approved by the Sindh government. However, the white paper on teacher licensing developed by the Aga Khan Univer­sity Institute for Edu­cational Development provided a sound foundation for the policy.\n\nSTEDA launched the Teaching Licence Policy, Sindh, in 2023. While a good number of teachers applied for licences, just a small section qualified. Re­­cognising the importance of the teaching licensing at STEDA’s teacher certification ceremony, the Sindh chief minister presented awards in the presence of the Sindh education minister, public representatives, the Sindh education secretary, academics, district school managements, policymakers and others.\n\nAdditionally, in order to incentivise teacher licensing, the Sindh government has also raised the remunerations of teachers in grades 14 to 16. But STEDA still needs to disseminate detailed information to maximise participation in the licensing programme, and understand that a third party’s conduct of the test reflects poorly on the teacher education programmes offered by the public sector in the province.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sindh government must improve the quality of these programmes as well as have the assessments conducted regularly to increase the number of licenced teachers in the province.\n\nThe writer is a senior educationist, policy scholar and researcher.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
