Fast lanes are riddled with potholes, while the motorcycle and bus lanes remain filled with standing water, mud and sludge.\n\nThe condition of roads around Powerhouse Chowrangi and 4-K Chowrangi has deteriorated to the extent that a journey which should normally take seconds now takes several minutes due to potholes.\n\nSimilarly, the road leading from Nagan Chowrangi towards Gulshan Chowrangi has caved in at several points near Shafiq Mor bus stop, causing severe inconvenience to road users. The damaged stretch frequently triggers traffic jams, compounding commuters’ misery.\n\nAt Qalandria Chowrangi near the Sakhi Hassan graveyard, and the stretch leading towards Anda Mor, the road has almost vanished as only a few patches are visible.\n\nVehicular movement here has become extremely difficult.\n\nSimilarly, the condition of Landikotal Chowrangi and the road running towards the Tahir Villa roundabout — which has been under construction for months — is the worst. Abdul Rafay, a passer-by, said that the broken roads and the entire intersection had been dug up in the name of development work, and it had been like that for months.\n\nAnother vital artery, Shahrah-i-Pakistan, is badly affected near the Ayesha Manzil electronics market where the flyover begins. A large pothole — highlighted through a sofa placed in the middle of the road — causes severe traffic jams on a daily basis.\n\nSimilarly, the section of the same road near Dak Khana roundabout — also known as S.M. Taufiq Road — has sunk several inches, bringing traffic flow towards Teen Hatti to a near standstill.\n\n“This road was in better condition before the rains,” said local resident Basir Mumtaz. “But just one spell has completely destroyed it, making commuting extremely difficult for all of us.”\n\nAn elderly commuter, Munawar, said: “After laying pipelines, the authorities merely filled the dug-up spot but never rebuilt the road. Following the rains, the stretch has sunk even further. Now travelling here daily has become a torment.”\n\nHe added that even a newly constructed road — Syed Altaf Ali Barelvi Road, recently inaugurated — had sunk at several points after just one day of rainfall.\n\nSimilarly, Jahangir Road, from Teen Hatti to Gurumandir, which was constructed last year, could not withstand the single spell of rain and has become an unpaved track with water stagnating at several places.\n\nThe condition of the road from the Trimax Hospital signal in Federal B Area, Yaseenabad, to the UBL Sports Complex has deteriorated severely, with numerous potholes and accumulated rainwater making commuting extremely difficult.\n\nSehba Akhtar Road, which runs from Sir Shah Muhammad Suleman Road at Hassan Square to Allama Shabbir Ahmed Usmani Road, is in a severely dilapidated state. Large portions of the stretch have broken apart, while stagnant rainwater and mud continue to add to the misery of commuters.\n\nIn Gulistan-i-Jauhar of District East, the Munawar Chowrangi road, which leads towards Pehalwan Goth Road, has broken apart, with large sections peeling away — as if an earthquake had torn the road apart.\n\nAt Jauhar Chowrangi, the road beside the Palestine underpass — built only last year — has cracked at multiple points, raising questions about the “Rs1.3 billion spent” on its construction.\n\nThe University Road, already under construction, has also deteriorated further.\n\nIn District Korangi, roads at Dawood Chowrangi are in shambles. A large portion leading towards the Landhi flyover has all but disappeared, with standing water hampering movement and causing constant gridlock.\n\nIn District West, Manghopir Road at Banaras Chowk has collapsed, while Metroville Road towards Bab-i-Khyber is also in deplorable condition. “This road was built after years, but even it has not withstood the rains,” said a resident. “Crossing this stretch daily has become a nightmare.”\n\nSimilarly, Shahrah-i-Qaddafi, a busy artery of Orangi Town, has caved in near the 15 No. bus stop, severely inconveniencing commuters and disrupting traffic flow. The recently built road at Nishan-i-Haider, which goes towards Islam Chowk, has washed away in the recent rains, reflecting a sheer waste of taxpayers’ money.\n\nThe city’s District South has not been spared either.\n\nHere, several major roads have also deteriorated after the rains, with potholes and cracks making commuting an ordeal. On Sharea Faisal, large portions of the middle lanes have broken. While motorists can still manoeuvre through the damaged stretches, motorcyclists face grave risks.\n\n“If a motorcycle is travelling at 60 to 70 kilometres per hour and a pothole suddenly appears just a few metres ahead, how can the rider possibly save himself?” asked a delivery boy. “If the rider slows down, there is the risk of being hit by the vehicles behind, and if he swerves, the danger of an accident remains.”\n\nOther key arteries, including M.A. Jinnah and I.I. Chundrigar Road, also have cracks.\n\nOn Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road, the stretch adjacent to Burns Garden has created at least six six-foot deep crater, raising questions about the authorities’ ability to maintain some of the busiest and most vital thoroughfares of the metropolis.\n\nThe current situation has reinforced the impression that institutions have made little or no sincere effort to rehabilitate or improve the city’s dilapidated road network.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
