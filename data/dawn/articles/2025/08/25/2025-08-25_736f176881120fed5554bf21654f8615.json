  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Despite the intervention of parliament, the woes of tens of thousands of employees regularised through a cabinet subcommittee headed by Syed Khursheed Shah do not seem to end.\n\nThe Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) has written a letter to the Secretary Establishment Division to provide data so that arrangements for tests and interviews would be finalised.\n\nOn the other hand, the employees are of the view that they have got assurance from parliamentarians, especially Mr Shah, that their issue will be addressed by parliament next month so they should not be disturbed by such steps.\n\nDuring the PPP government (2008-13), the cabinet subcommittee headed by Mr Shah was established for the regularisation of daily wage and contractual employees. Tens of thousands of employees were regularised in dozens of ministries and divisions. However, the Supreme Court, last year, ordered the authorities to restart the process under FPSC as the employees were regularised without tests and interviews.\n\nFPSC letter to Secretary Establishment Division seeks data of employees to finalise arrangements for tests and interviews\n\nThe letter written by the FPSC, dated Aug 20 and available with Dawn, has suggested to the Establishment Division to take necessary action to ensure compliance with the judgement of the Supreme Court regarding referring to FPSC the matter of federal government employees in BS-16 and above regularised by the cabinet subcommittee. The FPSC was given the responsibility by the court to determine eligibility and fitness by conducting tests and interviews.\n\n“It has been observed that despite lapse of considerable time, only two organisations provided complete information. However, rest of the organisations either did not provide the required information or incomplete information was forwarded to FPSC. Owing to which, test and interview could not be held in compliance of the above said judgment of the apex court,” it stated.\n\nThe FPSC stated that it was considering holding tests and interviews in November this year, so the Establishment Division may issue directions to all ministries, divisions and organisations to provide the requisite complete information by September 10.\n\nLast month, tens of thousands of employees including teachers, doctors and others took a sigh of relief after the National Assembly’s Standing Committee for Cabinet, while considering the suggestion of Mr Shah, unanimously decided to send the matter to parliament to take a decision.\n\nIt directed that no action will be taken against the employees till final outcome of the parliament. The committee, chaired by MNA Malik Ibrar Ahmed, decided to protect the rights of the employees as they have been working for the last 15 to 20 years.\n\nProminent orthopaedic surgeon at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) Dr Asfandyar Khan, while talking to Dawn, said they have got assurance from parliamentarians that the matter regarding protection of employees will sail through parliament in September.\n\n“Such letters put us under severe pressure and we are under stress over the ongoing situation. There are no constraints of funding for our seats as funds are being allocated for last over a decade for us,” he explained.\n\nHe said that a number of doctors including Professor Ahmareen, Associate Professors Dr Syed Amer Shah, Dr Faheem, Deputy Executive Director Pims Dr Irum Naveed, Director Indoor Dr Raana Fatima, Director Emergence Dr Sherjeel, Pharmacists Ayesha Khan, Sidra Sulehri, Sharif Khattak and over 150 other doctors and nurses were regularised by the Syed Khursheed Shah committee.\n\n“Majority of the employees are near or over 50 years old and have been working in hospitals for almost 25 years. Sending them to the FPSC would be tantamount to expelling them from service as they might not be able to clear tests and interviews after so many years,” he added.\n\nA senior doctor at Polyclinic, Dr Abdul Jabbar Bhutto, said employees had worked on contractual and daily wage basis for over a decade and finally the cabinet committee regularised them.\n\n“We have dealt with a number of health crises including Covid-19 but now our jobs have been put at stake which is not a good sign,” he said.\n\nIn September 2024, some employees approached the Supreme Court for seniority and other benefits, but the apex court ordered them to approach FPSC.\n\nOn March 9, 2025, the Establishment Division issued an order due to which all ministries and divisions started work to send regularised employees to FPSC. On the other hand, doctors were of the view that they can perform surgeries but might not be able to clear written tests.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
