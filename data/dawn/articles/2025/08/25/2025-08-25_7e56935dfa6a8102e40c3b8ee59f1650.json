Promoting a strong China-Pakistan relationship is conducive to maintaining regional peace and stability,” he said.\n\n“China supports Pakistan in resolutely cracking down on all forms of terrorism and creating a secure and favourable environment for national development and bilateral cooperation,” the readout of his meeting with the PM quoted him as saying.\n\nWang noted that China had always prioritised Pakistan in its neighbourhood diplomacy, adding that “China will continue to support Pakistan in safeguarding its territorial integrity and national security, and welcomes Pakistan to play a greater role in international affairs”.\n\nAccording to the Chinese foreign ministry statement, both the army chief and the prime minister vowed to ensure security of Chinese citizens in Pakistan, and appreciated Beijing’s valuable support in the long-term economic and social development of Pakistan.\n\n“The Pakistani military is willing to actively promote counterterrorism and security cooperation between the two countries, and will continue to make every effort to ensure the safety of Chinese personnel, projects and institutions in Pakistan,” the army chief was quoted as saying.\n\nSeparately, in a briefing earlier this week, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign minister noted that China would work with Pakistan to jointly develop the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), terming their all-weather strategic partnership “unbreakable”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
