There are differences of opinion, but when it comes to defending the system, defending the country, and standing up against the enemy, the people are united,” Khamenei added.\n\nThe United States and its allies accuse Iran of seeking to acquire nuclear weapons, a claim Tehran has repeatedly denied.\n\nThe June war broke out as Tehran and Washington were due to hold their sixth round of talks on Iran’s nuclear programme, but the negotiations that had begun weeks earlier were derailed by the conflict.\n\nIran is due to meet on Tuesday with Britain, France and Germany for nuclear talks, as the European powers have threatened to reimpose sanctions if no agreement is reached.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
