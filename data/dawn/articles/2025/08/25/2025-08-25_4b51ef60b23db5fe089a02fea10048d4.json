  "content": "GILGIT: Prince Rahim Aga Khan, the leader of the Ismaili community, has said the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) will continue to support the Gilgit-Baltistan government and local communities to recover from recent damages and build resilience to face future challenges.\n\nIn a letter presented to the GB chief minister by the Gilgit Shia Imami Ismaili Council president, the Aga Khan extended “heartfelt sympathy for the devastating losses suffered by the people of Gilgit-Baltistan as a result of the recent flash floods and related disasters”.\n\n“I am in close contact with our Council and the agencies of the AKDN in Pakistan, and I continue to monitor the situation as more such events are witnessed each day,” the letter said, adding that he was particularly sad to hear about the deaths of the volunteers who were working to restore the water-supply infrastructure near Gilgit.\n\n“Thank you for your letter of 24th July seeking assistance in the recovery and restoration phase,” he said in the letter.\n\n“From the time of my great-grandfather, the Ismaili Imamat has sought to play an integral role in the development and progress of the GB people. This region remains close to my heart…,” the letter said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
