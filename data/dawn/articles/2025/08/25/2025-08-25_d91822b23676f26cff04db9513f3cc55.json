Others said they would prefer to die and not leave.\n\nThe Israeli military said on Sunday that its forces have returned to combat in the Jabalia area in recent days to strengthen control of the area. It added that the operation there enables the expansion of combat into additional areas and prevents Hamas from returning to operate in these areas.\n\nControl of Gaza City\n\nEarlier this month, Israel approved a plan to seize control of Gaza City, describing it as the last bastion of Hamas.\n\nDefence Minister Israel Katz on Sunday vowed to press on with the offensive on the city where famine has been declared, which has raised alarm abroad and objections at home. Katz has said that Gaza City would be razed unless Hamas agrees to Israel’s terms.\n\nHamas said Israel’s plan to take over Gaza City showed it wasn’t serious about a ceasefire. It said a ceasefire agreement was the only way to return the Israeli prisoners, holding Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responsible for their lives.\n\nThe proposal on the table calls for a 60-day ceasefire and the release of 10 living Israeli prisoners held in Gaza and of 18 bodies. In turn, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nOnce a temporary ceasefire begins, the proposal is for Hamas and Israel to begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining Israeli prisoners.\n\nOn Thursday, Netanyahu said that Israel would immediately resume negotiations for the release of all 50 Israeli prisoners — of whom Israel believes around 20 are still living - and an end to the nearly two-year-old war but on terms acceptable to Israel.\n\nFamine\n\nAround half of the Palestinian enclave’s two million people currently live in Gaza City. Thousands have already left, carrying their belongings on vehicles and rickshaws.\n\n“I stopped counting the times I had to take my wife and three daughters and leave my home in Gaza City,” said Mohammad, 40, via a chat app. “No place is safe, but I can’t take the risk. If they suddenly begin the invasion, they will use heavy fire.” Others said they will not leave, no matter what.\n\nA global hunger monitor said last week that Gaza City and surrounding areas are officially suffering from famine that will likely spread.\n\nOn Sunday, the Gaza health ministry said eight more people died of malnutrition and starvation in the enclave, raising deaths from such causes to 289 people, including 115 children.\n\nWith input from Reuters\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
