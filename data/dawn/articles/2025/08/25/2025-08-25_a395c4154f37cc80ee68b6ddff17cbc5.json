  "content": "COPENHAGEN: More than 10,000 people took part in a pro-Palestinian demonstration in Copenhagen on Sunday, calling for an end to the war in Gaza and urging Denmark to recognise the state of Palestine.\n\nSome 100 organisations including Oxfam, Greenpeace and Amnesty took part in the march, as well as unions, political parties, artists’ collectives and activists including Greta Thunberg.\n\nPolice did not provide an estimate of the number of demonstrators.\n\nGathering under sunny skies outside the Danish parliament, the demonstrators — many of them families with young children — waved flags and carried banners, chanting “Stop Arms Sales”, “Free Free Palestine” and “Denmark Says No to Genocide”.\n\nA traditional supporter of Israel, Denmark has said it wants to use its current presidency of the European Union to increase pressure on the Israeli government to end the war in Gaza, which Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen recently said had gone “too far”.\n\nBut Denmark has said it has no plans to recognise a Palestinian state in the near future. “Those who are in power are not stopping the genocide, so it’s even more important to go out and protest and show all the leaders that we do not agree with this,” 43-year-old demonstrator Michelle Appelros said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
