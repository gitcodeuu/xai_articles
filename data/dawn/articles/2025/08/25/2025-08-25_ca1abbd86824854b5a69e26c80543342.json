By doing so, the exhibition can display the diversity of culture, friendship and cooperation of the SCO family,” said a letter inviting the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM) to participate.\n\nPakistan is among the nine full-member states, such as Russia, Kazakhs­tan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Iran, which are contributing artefacts for a show titled “Collections from Museums of Shanghai Cooperation Organisation Member States. Belarus officially joined the SCO in July 2024, making it the tenth member.\n\nRelics include iconic Indus bull seal, astrolabe and several pieces depicting the Buddha\n\nPakistan is contributing ten artefacts dating from the late Neolithic period — Mehrgarh, down to Mohenjo Daro and all the way to the Islamic period, DOAM Director Dr Abdul Ghafoor Lone told Dawn.\n\nThe items include a stunning terracotta female figurine dating back to 3,000-3,500 BCE from the Neolithic period and a 2,800-2,700 BCE painted globular pot.\n\nThe 5,000 BCE Steatite Indus Seal with a humped bull and inscription is the oldest relic to be put on display at the exhibition. The 1,600-1,800 BCE terracotta horse figurine and the Jain ritual tank adorned with birds and lamps, which dates back to 600-200 BCE, will also be put on display.\n\nThe most interesting piece, perhaps, is the stone panel depicting Apalala Jataka, 3-4 Century BCE. The relic shows Buddha commanding Naga Apalala, a water-dwelling Naga in Buddhist mythology, to stop flooding the Swat River and the valley. It is said that Apalala lived near the Swat River.\n\nBesides the 3rd to 4th Century CE Buddha head, also on display will be the 19th Century CE Astrolabe used by sailors. In its simplest form, it’s a metal disc with perforations that allowed sailors to calculate astronomical positions precisely.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 25th, 2025",
