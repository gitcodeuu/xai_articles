The current bill will have to pass a parliamentary vote and gain the approval of the Guardian Council, a body empowered to vet legislation.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when the parliamentary vote would take place.\n\nIn May, Iran’s Central Bank Governor Mohammad Reza Farzin said he would pursue the plan, noting that the Iranian rial “does not have a favourable image” in the global economy.\n\nThe move comes as Iran faces deepening economic challenges, including runaway inflation, a sharply devalued currency, and the prolonged impact of international sanctions.\n\nAs of Sunday, the rial was trading at around 920,000 to the US dollar on the street market, according to local media and the Bonbast website that monitors unofficial exchange rates.\n\nIn practice, Iranians have long abandoned the rial in everyday transactions, using the toman instead. One toman equals 10 rials.\n\nIran’s economy has long been under severe strain due to sweeping US sanctions since Washington’s 2018 withdrawal from a landmark nuclear deal during US President Donald Trump’s first term in office.\n\nUpon returning to office in January, Trump revived his “maximum pressure” sanctions campaign on Tehran. In June, Iranian lawmakers approved new economy minister Ali Madanizadeh after his predecessor, Abdolnaser Hemmati, was ousted in a no-confidence vote for failing to address the country’s economic woes.\n\nThe same month Israel launched an unprecedented attack on Iran’s nuclear and military infrastructure, beginning a deadly 12-day war.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
