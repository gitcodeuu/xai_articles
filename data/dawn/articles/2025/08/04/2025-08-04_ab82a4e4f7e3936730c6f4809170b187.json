According to the power division, the capacity costs denominated in US dollars escalated from Rs11 to Rs18.4 mainly due to the depreciation of rupee against dollar from about Rs100 to Rs300.\n\nThe fuel costs generally remained flat as lower-cost generation capacities came online.\n\nTherefore, “delinking capacity costs from impact of depreciation, and enhancing reliance on indigenous sources remains critical to ensure sustainability”, the power division advocated.\n\nThe overall tariff is further bloated by extraneous taxes and other duties, increasing the costs for the end-consumer.\n\nDespite all efforts and reforms, both the average tariff and capacity charges would “keep growing”.\n\nGoing forward, capacity charges are estimated at Rs3.14tr in FY2034, up by 65pc, the power division said.\n\nDeindustrialisation\n\nThe power division also confirmed “deindustrialisation” that further contracted demand.\n\n“Increase in electricity prices made industry uncompetitive, resulting in closure of industrial units and accelerating process of deindustrialisation”, it said and reported that industrial power consumption peaked in FY22 at 34 billion units (kWh) and declined to 28bn units in FY24, “largely due to higher prices and transition to off-grid generation”.\n\nThe power division said “inefficient pricing” increased the cost of debt servicing, further burdening consumers and contracting demand.\n\nFurther compounding the issues was the fact that despite tall claims, aggregate technical and commercial (ATC) losses remained mostly flat — 18.9pc in FY2013 and 18.3pc in FY2024. ATC losses broadly cover the difference between units produced and recovered.\n\nThe power division forecast for slower growth in tariff — 25 to 30pc over the next decade against over 260pc in the past decade — comes on the back of an increase in generation from clean-fuel sources to 66pc by 2034 against 46pc in FY25.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
