  "content": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: The closure of Angoor Adda border crossing on the Pakistan-Afghanistan frontier has entered its 23rd month, triggering a deepening economic and livelihood crisis for local traders, labourers, and the broader business community.\n\nTrade remains suspended, markets lie deserted, and the local economy is facing near-total paralysis.\n\nThe local traders’ community has renewed its call to the federal government, demanding the immediate reopening of the border for commercial activities, citing growing economic desperation and mounting unemployment in the region.\n\nPresident of Lower South Waziristan Chamber of Commerce and Industry Saifur Rehman told media representatives that the prolonged closure had resulted in losses worth billions of rupees, severely affecting both the local trading sector and the national exchequer.\n\nHe said that bilateral trade with Afghanistan through the crossing had come to a virtual standstill. “The ripple effect has crippled local markets, warehouses, transport operations, and several supporting industries,” he noted.\n\nMr Rehman further said that thousands of daily wage earners associated with transport, hospitality, offloading, warehousing, and retail sectors had lost their livelihoods due to the continued suspension of trade.\n\n“Many households are now struggling to make ends meet,” he said. “The closure has turned once-bustling trading hubs into economic dead zones.”\n\nHe said due to the ongoing blockade, several traders have reportedly shifted their operations to alternative trade routes such as Torkham, Chaman, and Ghulam Khan. “However, these alternatives are costlier, time-consuming, and do not offer the same logistical advantages as Angoor Adda.”\n\n“This shift has not only increased transportation costs but also weakened the economic relevance of South Waziristan in regional trade,” Mr Rehman added.\n\nIn response to growing concerns, the district administration has said that efforts are underway to reopen the border.\n\nOfficials confirmed that the matter has been raised at higher government levels, and they are optimistic that a solution will be reached soon.\n\n“We fully understand the hardships faced by the business community,” a senior official said. “All relevant institutions are actively engaged, and we hope for a positive development in the near future.”\n\nWith the Angoor Adda border closed for nearly two years, economic uncertainty looms large over Lower South Waziristan. The local population and business leaders are anxiously awaiting federal government’s action to resolve the issue.\n\nTraders warn that failure to reopen the border could lead to worsening poverty and region-wide economic stagnation. They have hinted at launching protests and sit-ins if their demands are not met promptly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
