The increase in target killings puts a question mark on law enforcement agencies.”\n\nHe added: “The network of sectarian extremists is becoming active again.”\n\nEarlier this week, a senior lawyer was shot dead while his son was hurt in a suspected targeted attack in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority.\n\nSouth Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the firing took place after a funeral prayer at a mosque in DHA Phase 6.\n\n“As advocate Khawaja Shamsul Islam and his son [Khawaja Daniyal, 25] were about to leave the mosque, a lone gunman apparently resorted to firing on them and fled,” the DIG said. “Both father and son were shot and transported to a private hospital in Clifton, where Islam succumbed to his injuries.”",
