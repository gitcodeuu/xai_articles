  "content": "WASHINGTON: A craving for international prestige, a decade-long Obama rivalry and perhaps a dash of provocation: a mercurial melange of factors is at play in Donald Trump’s obsession with the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n“It’s well past time that President Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters on July 31, prompting reactions of disbelief and sarcasm from the opponents of the Republican leader.\n\nSince his January 20 return to power, the US president “has brokered, on average, one peace deal or ceasefire per month,” Leavitt said, citing as examples his mediations between India and Pakistan; Cambodia and Thailand; Egypt and Ethiopia; Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo; Serbia and Kosovo; and others.\n\nHis leading spokeswoman also mentioned Iran, where Trump ordered US strikes against the nuclear facilities, as evidence of decisions that Leavitt claims have contributed to world peace.\n\nWith 338 nominees for the October award, some betting sites have Trump in second place to win, just behind Alexei Navalny’s widow\n\nShe made no mention of the conflict in Ukraine, which Trump pledged multiple times to end on “day one” of his term, or the war in Gaza that rumbles on and for which the US supplies Israel with weapons.\n\nPakistan, Israel\n\nFor some foreign leaders, mentioning the prestigious award has become a sign of diplomatic goodwill towards an American president who envisions himself as a peacemaker.\n\nInterestingly, Pakistan nominated Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize, as did Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nDuring an early July meeting at the White House, a journalist asked the presidents of Liberia, Senegal, Mauritania, Guinea-Bissau, and Gabon whether Trump deserved the award.\n\nBasking in the flattering responses from the African leaders, a smiling Trump said: “We could do this all day long.”\n\nNominations\n\nTens of thousands of people can offer a nomination to the Nobel committee, including lawmakers, ministers, certain university professors, former laureates and members of the committee themselves.\n\nLaw professor Anat Alon-Beck, who is an Israeli-American, submitted Trump’s name to the committee’s five members, who were appointed by the Norwegian Parliament.\n\nThe assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Law said she did so because of the “extraordinary leadership” and “strategic brilliance” he has shown, in her opinion, in advancing peace and securing the release of prisoners held in the Gaza Strip.\n\nNominations are due by January 31, with the announcement coming in October this year on the 10th of the month.\n\nFor some, the prospect of handing the prize to someone who has upended the international order is untenable.\n\n“Nominating Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize is like entering a hyena in a dog show,” US history and politics researcher Emma Shortis wrote on news site The Conversation.\n\n“Of course Trump does not deserve it.”\n\nThe American president disagrees. “I deserve it, but they will never give it to me,” Trump told reporters earlier this year when he hosted Netanyahu at the White House, lamenting not ticking the Nobel box in his life.\n\n“No, I won’t get a Nobel Peace Prize no matter what I do, including Russia/Ukraine, and Israel/Iran, whatever those outcomes may be,” Trump griped on his Truth Social platform in June.\n\nTrump is well-known as someone who is particularly fond of accolades and prizes, Garret Martin, a professor of international relations at American University, said, “so he would welcome this major international recognition.”\n\nAnd since the beginning of his presidential ambitions 10 years ago, “he has put himself in opposition to Barack Obama, who famously won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009,” Martin added.\n\nBefore Obama, three other US presidents — Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, and Jimmy Carter — have also been so honoured. The prize was also awarded to Henry Kissinger in 1973 for his efforts to help end the war in Vietnam. This choice was also heavily criticised.\n\nThe full list of Nobel Peace Prize nominees is confidential — except for individual announcements by sponsors — but their number is made public. In 2025, there are 338 nominees. Some betting sites have Trump in second place to win, behind Yulia Navalnaya, the widow of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
