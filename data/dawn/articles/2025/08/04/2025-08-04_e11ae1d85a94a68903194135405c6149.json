The current share is 57.5 per cent.\n\nThere are no clear workarounds available at the moment. The centre managed to take out the lucrative petroleum levy from the divisible pool by calling it a developmental levy rather than a tax (which it is in all but name). However, any further change would require amending the Constitution — either by doing away with Article 160-3A that places a floor on the downward transfer, or by amending Article 160-3 to take out transferrable revenue sources. The former is more likely than the latter.\n\nWhat are the political prospects of this change?\n\nThe recent reconfiguration of the ruling coalition’s National Assembly strength, through the bizarre reserved seats judgement, hands over a virtual two-thirds majority to the ruling coalition and its allies. The provincial assembly numbers have also been skewed the same way, paving the way for more favourable Senate numbers. Recent outcomes of the Senate polls from KP already show this strategy bearing fruit.\n\nThe NFC award is not some great heist that the provinces performed on an unsuspecting centre.\n\nIn any case, as demonstrated by the past year, constitutional norms hardly pose much of a challenge for the governing regime. Numbers can be conjured up and subsequently validated by the courts. A bigger unknown variable here is the PPP’s position on the matter.\n\nThe reserved seat reallocation may have slightly diluted the PPP’s importance and strengthened the PML-N, but a constitutional amendment will require everyone on the treasury benches to play along. Given its foundational role in the current NFC and the 18th Amendment, the PPP’s position has remained consistent in favour of large transfers to the provinces. It’s unclear what would compel the needle to move on this front. If the establishment decides it wants to push ahead with it, inducements and coercion will both be applied.\n\nAt a broader level, most talk around the NFC focuses on its technical and developmental dimensions. Centrists in favour of cutting the provinces’ share usually provide some or all of the following arguments:\n\nPeople can agree or disagree with these arguments, but the fact remains that the current system is constitutional in nature. What revenues are to be shared has a history going back nearly a century.\n\nWhat is the percentage of that share was agreed upon by all legitimate political forces through deliberations 15 years ago. Contrary to how some present it, the NFC award is not some great heist that the provinces performed on an unsuspecting centre. It was, and remains, a consensual agreement.\n\nBut there is another perspective worth considering.\n\nThe NFC is also what provides space for any semblance of civilian politics under a hybrid regime. For much of the last decade, politics at the centre has remained hostage to the compulsions of civil-military intrigue and the demands of IMF programmes. There is little space for civilian political action on the development and policy front. Consequently, there is little that they can do politics on. Survival and success at the centre is correlated with compliance rather than performance.\n\nIt is instead in the provinces where there is far more space available, thanks to the flow of finances from the centre. Parties looking to cement or recover their electoral position use provincial finances to hand out patronage or demonstrate their developmental ambitions; whether that is through expanding public sector employment, initiating social protection programmes, or building large infrastructure projects.\n\nThis should not be mistaken as a justification for profligate and inefficient spending. Provincial political elites have not delivered on many fronts and for that they should be held accountable. But the political consequences of slashing the provincial share should be considered. A hard budget constraint on provincial finances, which many envision under a revised NFC, would place limits on the space for party politics in its current form. If that is the desired end goal (and for some, it seems that it is), then the demand for a revised NFC makes sense.\n\nHowever, there is another proposal that can achieve greater province-level efficiency sought by the centrists, but doesn’t close off space for party politics. Instead of limiting transfers to the provinces, an amendment should guarantee further downward transfers to local governments, provided there are elected ones in place. In the absence of elected ones, the centre can hold back a designated share from the divisible pool. This helps solve the spending efficiency issue, allows space for developmental programmes that parties can use to claim political credit, and provides an incentive to have a functional third tier.\n\nThe writer teaches sociology at Lums.\n\nX: @umairjav\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
