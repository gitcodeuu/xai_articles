He added 125 runs in an unbeaten partnership with J.P. Duminy (50 not out of 28 balls).\n\nEarlier after electing to bat first, Pakistan posted 196 for the loss of five wickets in the allotted 20 overs.\n\nOpener Sharjeel Khan cracked 76 off 44 balls with the help of nine fours and four sixes while Umar Amin contributed 36 not out off 19. Pakistan added 61 runs in the last five overs as Asif Ali struck 28 off 15 balls, which included two sixes and a four. However, the total could not pose a major obstacle for South Africa.\n\nFor South Africa, Wayne Parnell (2-32) and Hardus Viljoen (2-28) were the main wicket-takers while Duanne Olivier claimed 1-38.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
