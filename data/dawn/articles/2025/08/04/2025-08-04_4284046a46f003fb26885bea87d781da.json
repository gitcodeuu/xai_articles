Although not officially recognised, these coups often receive implicit support from the monarchy, especially when a civilian government becomes popular among the Thai public.\n\nToday, tensions are rising again as the Thai military strategically positions itself to challenge the government of Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, the daughter of Thaksin Shinawatra, who was himself removed from power in a 2006 coup. To build domestic support for their political ambitions, the military is utilising a powerful force in Thai society: Nationalism.\n\nTo fuel this nationalist agenda, the Thai military started border clashes with Cambodia on May 28, killing Cambodian soldier Suon Rorn. Cambodia immediately expressed her intention to file a lawsuit with the ICJ for a peaceful resolution. However, Thai military leader Lieutenant General Boonsin Padklang reje­cted this approach and chose military confrontation over diplomacy.\n\nThe situation worsened when Thai soldiers were injured by landmines while patrolling what they claimed as Thai territory.\n\nThe mines were remnants from Cambodia’s civil war on Cambodian land that hadn’t been cleared. Instead of admitting their illegal cross-border activity, the Thai military accused Cambodia of negligence, and the Thai civilian government, competing with the military for popularity among Thai people, expelled Cambodia’s ambassador. They also closed access to key tourist sites, including Khmer temples inside Cambodian territory.\n\nThe most dangerous escalation occurred when the Thai military opened fire and crossed into Cambodia, damaging the Preah Vihear Temple, a Unesco World Heritage Site. They also targeted civilian sites in Cambodia, including religious sites and a hospital, which is prohibited by international law.\n\nCivilian lives have been lost. Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet has called on Asean, the UN Security Council, and US President Donald Trump to intervene and force a peaceful resolution.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
