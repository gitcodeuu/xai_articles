However, witnesses and Hamas sources said many of those trucks have been looted by desperate displaced people and armed gangs.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Sunday he had asked the International Committee of the Red Cross to give humanitarian assistance to the hostages during a conversation with the head of the Swiss-based ICRC’s local delegation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
