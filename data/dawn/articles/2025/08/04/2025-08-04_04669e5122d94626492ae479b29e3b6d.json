The mountainous regions face a risk of landslides, while urban areas could experience urban flooding.\n\nThe PDMA has warned that strong winds and thunderstorms may damage vulnerable structures such as houses, electricity poles, billboards, and solar panels.\n\nIn response, all district administrations have been instructed to take necessary precautions, including cleaning drainage systems and providing timely warnings to residents, tourists, and travellers.\n\nThe PDMA has also issued directives for farmers, livestock owners, and tourists to move their crops and animals to safe locations and avoid visiting dangerous areas during Aug 4 to 7.\n\nRelevant authorities have been directed to ensure availability of emergency services, medical aid, food, and other essential items.
