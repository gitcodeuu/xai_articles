  "content": "SINGAPORE: Summer McI­n­tosh capped a brilliant world championship with the 400 metres individual medley (IM) title and a fourth individual gold medal while Leon Marc­hand roared to victory in the men’s event in Singapore on Sunday.\n\nWorld record holder McIntosh blitzed the field in the 400 IM with a time of 4:25.78, more than seven seconds ahead of joint silver medallists Jenna Forrester of Australia and Japan’s Mio Narita.\n\nThe US set a world record in the women’s 4x100 medley relay to claim the final title and ensure they topped the medals table with nine golds, one ahead of Australia.\n\nFrance finished third with Canada fourth, all four of their golds won by 18-year-old McIntosh, only the third swimmer to win five individual medals at a world championship, joining Michael Phelps (2007) and Sarah Sjostrom (2019).\n\nThe Olympic champion’s third 400 IM world title added to her 200 IM, 200 butterfly and 400 freestyle golds at the World Aquatics Championships Arena in Singapore.\n\nBut bronze in the 800 freestyle won by the great Katie Ledecky on Saturday gave McIntosh little joy .\n\n“I think it was very obvious that my goal was five golds,” she said. “Even if I were to get five golds, I would still want more. That’s just my mentality.”\n\nChina’s 12-year-old prodigy Yu Zidi finished just off the podium again in the 400 IM, capping a sparkling debut at a global meeting. She was also fou­rth in the 200 IM and 200 butterfly.\n\nMARCHAND MEDLEY GOLD\n\nOlympic champion Marchand nearly missed the 400 IM final after a slow heat in the morning but was back to his best in the evening, clocking 4:04.73 to finish well clear of Japan’s Tomo­yuki Matsushita, the Paris Games runner-up.\n\nIt was a stripped-back programme from Paris where Marchand won four individual titles but he made Singapore count, taking the 200 IM world record on the way to the title.\n\nTwo years after Tunisia’s Ahmed Hafnaoui won the 800 and 1,500 freestyle at the Fukuoka championships, compatriot Ahmed Jaouadi completed the double by winning the 1,500 in 14:34.41 on the final day ahead of German runner-up Sven Schwarz and American Olympic champion Bobby Finke.\n\nJaouadi shaved nearly nine seconds off his personal best.\n\nAustralian relay stalwart Meg Harris grabbed the spotlight for herself when she won 50 freestyle gold in 24.02 ahead of Chinese duo Wu Qingfeng (24.26) and Cheng Yujie (24.28).\n\nThe 23-year-old Harris clinc­hed her first individual title on the global stage after sharing two Olympic and five world relay golds in the last four years.\n\nNo Russian athletes competed at last year’s world championships in Doha but the nation’s swimmers racked up medals in Singapore under a neutral flag.\n\nRussians were allowed to compete on condition they had not publicly supported the invasion of Ukraine or held any affiliation to the Russian military.\n\nRussian Kliment Kolesnikov stormed to the men’s 50 backstroke title in 23.68, just 0.13 off his world record, while compatriot Pavel Samusenko took a silver along with South African Pieter Coetze, each finishing in 24.17.\n\nRussian swimmers then combined to win a shock gold in the men’s 4x100 medley, giving the world record (3:26.78) a huge shake with a time of 3:26.93, a second clear of France.\n\nWith the US men taking bronze it was up to the nation’s women to secure top spot on the medals table in the final event of the night by beating Australia.\n\nThey did just that and in some style, with Regan Smith, Kate Douglass, Gretchen Walsh and Torri Huske combining to set a world record of 3:49.34, improving on the US mark of 3:49.63 from the Paris Games.\n\nWorld record holder Ruta Meilutyte earlier powered to the 50 breaststroke gold in 29.55, nearly half a second clear of China’s Tang Qianting.\n\nIt was the Lithuanian’s fourth successive world title in the event since returning from a two-year ban for anti-doping violations.\n\nRetiring American Lilly King, who won the 100 breaststroke at the Rio 2016 Games, bowed out fifth in her last individual event.\n\nKing’s team-mates were proud of the US performance at the event after several of the team’s swimmers suffered gastroenteritis from a pre-meeting camp in Thailand.\n\n“I’d say Team USA always knows how to finish with a bang,” said Douglass.\n\n“It just sends a really positive message out to the viewers at home who didn’t really believe in us.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
