  "content": "EUGENE: Olympic champions Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone and Masai Russell produced convincing wins at the US trials in Oregon to punch their tickets to the athletics World Championships on Saturday.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, the two-time Olympic 400m hurdles champion and golden girl of American track, stormed to victory in the 400m flat as she targets a new world title at Tokyo in September.\n\nRussell, the Olympic 100m hurdles champion, was similarly impressive, with a flawless performance delivering victory in 12.22secs at Eugene’s Hayward Field.\n\nBut while Paris Olympics gold medallists McLaughlin-Levrone and Russell delivered, there was an upset in the men’s 1,500m, where Olympic champion Cole Hocker finished in third.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone signalled she could well be in the hunt for gold in Tokyo after blasting to victory in 48.90secs, taking the tape ahead of Isabella Whittaker (49.59secs) and Aaliyah Butler in 49.91sec.\n\n“I felt like this is the year I wanted to step out of the box and really push myself in a different way,” McLaughlin-Levrone said of her decision to switch to 400m.\n\n“Obviously it’s uncomfortable, but I wanted to commit to it and I’m committed to it. Just excited to see where I can push myself,” she told AFP.\n\nRussell, who achieved a breakthrough major title with gold in Paris last year, will be the woman to beat in Tokyo in Saturday’s evidence.\n\nThe 25-year-old executed flawlessly to come home ahead of Grace Stark (12.31) and Alaysha Johnson (12.36).\n\nRussell started this season in pri­me form, clocking a US record 12.17secs in May before an ankle injury threatened to derail her season.\n\nHowever she looked back to her best in Saturday’s win.\n\n“I could have shut down my season two months ago when I couldn’t walk,” Russell said. “But I was like ‘This is the goal.’\n\n“Winning the Olympics put a little bit more pressure on me. Because I feel I have a standard to uphold. People expect something from the reigning Olympic champion.”\n\nA thrilling battle in the men’s 1,500m saw Olympic champion Hocker upstaged by Kenyan-born Jonah Koech.\n\nHocker found himself boxed in with 200 to go, and despite a strong finishing kick was unable to reel in Koech and second placed Ethan Strand.\n\nKoech won in a time of 3min 30.17sec, ahead of Strand in 3:30.25. Hocker was third in 3:30.37.\n\n“Winning was not the number one priority today, but I’m not gonna lie — it always stinks a little not to,” Hocker said. “I think if today was a world final, I’d have run that race a lot differently.\n\n“In the back of my head today, above all, above winning was to move on and get top three.”\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, Olympic 400m hurdles champion Rai Benja­min eased into Sunday’s final with a comfortable victory in the heats.\n\nBenjamin never looked in danger on his way to winning his heat in 47.45secs, the fastest time of qualifying.\n\nIn the men’s 400m, Jacory Patterson advanced to Tokyo with a win in 44.16secs, the latest milestone of his fairytale journey to elite sprinting.\n\nThe 25-year-old juggled his athletic career with a job working an overnight shift loading delivery trucks for UPS until recently, working his final shift in June.\n\n“I’m waiting for someone to pinch me,” Patterson said afterwards. “I don’t know, it just feels like a dream.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
