They opened fire inside the grid station, damaging the control room, high-power transformer, current transformers, conservator tank, radiator tubes, AC/DC panels, auxiliary panels, and other essential electrical equipment, according to a Qesco spokesperson.\n\nAfter holding the staff and guards at gunpoint for some time, the attackers reportedly threatened them to vacate the premises immediately or risk losing their life. Subsequently, the staff and guards fled to safety.\n\nLater, Qesco officials submitted a written complaint to the local police station to lodge an FIR against the attackers.\n\nSeparately, some men sabotaged the 132kV Yaro industrial transmission line near Kuchlak Bypass by creating a technical fault using ropes.\n\nDuring a joint patrolling operation with local administration and police, nearly 700m of conductors and various electrical components were found stolen.\n\nThe electric company later filed a written request with the police to pursue legal action against those behind the transmission line theft.\n\nThe spokesperson expressed serious concern over the rising number of sabotage and theft incidents targeting power infrastructure in Quetta, Mastung, Kalat, Dasht, and Sibi in recent weeks. The attacks not only disrupted power supply but also posed a significant threat to public safety and national assets, he added.\n\nThe Qesco appealed to all consumers to assist in protecting national infrastructure by reporting any suspicious activity related to theft or tampering of transmission lines.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 4th, 2025",
