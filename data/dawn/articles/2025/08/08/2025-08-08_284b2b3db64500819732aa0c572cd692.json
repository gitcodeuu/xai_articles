  "content": "KARACHI: Pakistan Refinery Ltd will import its first cargo of Nigerian Bonny Light crude from Vitol in September, two sources familiar with the matter said, as Asian refiners shift towards cheaper alternatives to Middle Eastern oil.\n\nThe 500,000-barrel, light-sweet crude cargo is expected to load later this month and arrive in Karachi by late September, the sources said, declining to be named as the information is not yet public. The price was not immediately known.\n\nVitol and PRL did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe purchase follows Pakistan’s first deal to import US crude, also supplied by Vitol, by Cnergyico, which is scheduled to arrive in October.\n\nHowever, along with other Asian refiners, Pakistan’s industry has shown increased interest in recent months in supplies from elsewhere, including US West Texas Intermediate and Kazakh CPC Blend, after Middle Eastern supplies became more expensive.\n\nAs early as 2014, Pakis­tan imported a Nigerian Yoho crude, according to data from Kpler, but the Bonny Light purchase is the country’s first known purchase of Bonny Light, which is valued for its high yields of gasoline and diesel.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
