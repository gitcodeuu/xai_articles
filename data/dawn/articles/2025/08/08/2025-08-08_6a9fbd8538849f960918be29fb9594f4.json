Due to land erosion caused by the nullah, dozens of houses are at risk in case of such events in the future.\n\nAccording to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Manage­ment Authority (GBDMA), the flood damaged the newly constructed retaining wall and a portion of the Kara­koram Highway. Though the highway is open to all types of traffic, the damaged section has been sealed off for safety measures.\n\nThe authority said a significant area of cultivable land, along with standing crops and trees, had been wiped out in the flood, while the electricity supply to Hassanabad was also disrupted. Similarly, a property owned by the Forest Dep­artment had suffered damage while a portion of Frontier Works Orga­ni­sa­tion’s land adjacent to a bri­dge also sustained damage.\n\nLocals said that four houses downstream were dismantled in time to save them from the flood. Last month, a similar Glof event damaged four houses, agricultural land, trees, and public and private properties.\n\nThe authority requested the National Highway Authority (NHA) to urgently visit the site to assess the damaged section and inspect other vulnerable parts of the road. Community Based Disaster Risk Management Committee members, GBDMA staff, and other volunteers were actively monitoring the situation on the site and supporting community preparedness and response efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, the Gilgit-Shandur Road remained closed off for the seventh day in Khotom village of the Phander valley, stranding thousands of people in the area.\n\nMet Office alert\n\nOn the other hand, the Pakistan Meteorological Department on Thursday afternoon issued a warning for heavy rain across Azad Kashmir and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advised citizens to stay alert, Dawn.com reported.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
