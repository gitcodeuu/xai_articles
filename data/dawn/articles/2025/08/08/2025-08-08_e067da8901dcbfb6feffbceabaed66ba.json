  "content": "KARACHI: The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) continued to decline for the third consecutive week, falling by $72 million during the week ended Aug 1. This brings the SBP’s total reserves down to $14.232 billion.\n\nSince July 11, the central bank has lost a cumulative $294m in reserves, reversing part of the gains made by the end of the last fiscal year. The SBP had closed FY25 with $14.5bn in reserves — surpassing the target set under the IMF programme, a milestone that was widely seen as a policy success.\n\nHowever, maintaining this level has proven challenging amid ongoing external debt servicing pressures. The SBP attributed the recent decline to scheduled external debt repayments.\n\nPakistan’s external debt servicing remains a major strain on the economy, with around $26bn paid in FY25 and a similar amount projected for FY26. These payments continue to exert downward pressure on the country’s foreign currency buffers.\n\nAccording to SBP data, the country’s total liquid foreign reserves stood at $19.495bn as of Aug 1, which includes $5.263bn held by commercial banks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
