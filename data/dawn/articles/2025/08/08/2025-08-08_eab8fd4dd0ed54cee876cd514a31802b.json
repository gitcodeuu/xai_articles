If the house is serious about shrinking the armed forces’ role, the police and the CTD must be strengthened,” he said.\n\nMr Baaz requested the chair to call the provincial\n\npolice chief and additional inspector general of the counter-terrorism department to the house for briefing on investigation into the killing of ANP leader from Bajaur Maulana Khanzeb.\n\nAdviser to the CM for communication and works Sohail Afridi said his leader and PTI founder Imran Khan dissolved assemblies and thought that elections would be held in 90 days but it took over a year for the electoral exercise to take place.\n\nHe said Imran was against drone strikes and military operations, so the PTI’s government would never allow any military offensive in the province.\n\n“Terrorists come over and ask for a meal. If we refuse, we are killed by them and if we do not, we are killed by the security forces,” he said, wondering how terrorists reach residential areas.\n\nMr Afridi said terrorist movement in residential areas was an “intelligence failure” and that authorities “allowed” terrorist infiltration.\n\nMPA Aurangzeb Khan said the situation would come under control only when people, security forces and police jointly fight against terrorists.\n\nHe said only people from the Orakzai tribal region decided not to allow any terrorists to operate in their area.\n\nHe said terrorists would be identified and their locations would be shared with law-enforcement agencies to see if any action was taken.\n\nMember of the opposition PPP Ashbar Jan Jadoon said his party respected the military and judiciary as national institutions.\n\nHe said those calling the assembly seats reserved for women and non-Muslims unconstitutional must know those seats were allotted to parties and not individuals.\n\n“You have been ruling this province for the last 12 years, what you have done so far against terrorism,” she asked the PTI members.\n\nMr Jadoon said attacks were a routine in the 2008-13 period, with the government funding terrorists.\n\nMPA Obaidur Rehman said that from the previous Zarb-i-Azb military operation in the tribal region to the ongoing Sarbakaf action in Bajaur tribal district, the province had witnessed 22 such offensives against terrorisms, claiming 8,0000 lives, costing $140 billion and displacing 3.5 million people, but the government didn’t launch even a single project to rehabilitate those people.\n\n“I ask state institutions how terrorists enter Pakistan, why they enter Pakistan only and why these Indian proxies don’t go to Punjab and Sindh,” he said.\n\nThe house unanimously passed MPA Asif Khan Mahsud’s resolution, seeking the renaming of South Upper Waziristan district as Mehsud Waziristan.\n\nThe chair later adjourned the sitting until Monday due to a lack of quorum.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
