Maximum temperatures in southwestern Iran and eastern Iraq locally exceeded 50°C,” it said.\n\nThe forecast said that persistent influence from a subtropical high will maintain the heatwaves across most of these areas.\n\n“Maximum temperatures in most of these regions will range between 38 and 40°C, with some areas exceeding 42°C. Specifically, localised temperatures could reach above 45°C in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Syria, western and southern Iran, the southwestern United States, western Algeria, and northern Mauritania,” it said.\n\nGlobal average temperatures are calculated using billions of satellite and weather readings, both on land and at sea, and the data used by Copernicus extends back to 1940.\n\nEven if July was milder in some places than in previous years, 11 countries experienced their hottest July in at least a half-century, including China, Japan, North Korea, Tajikistan, Bhutan, Brunei and Malaysia,.\n\nSeas overheating\n\nLast month was also the third-hottest July on record for sea surface temperatures.\n\nLocally, however, several ocean records for July were broken: in the Norwegian Sea, in parts of the North Sea, in the North Atlantic west of France and Britain.\n\nThe extent of Arctic sea ice was 10 per cent below average, the second lowest for a July in 47 years of satellite observations, virtually tied with the readings of 2012 and 2021.\n\nDiminishing sea ice is a concern not because it adds to sea levels, but because it replaces the snow and ice that reflect almost all the Sun’s energy back into space with deep blue ocean, which absorbs it.\n\nNinety per cent of the excess heat generated by global warming is absorbed by the oceans.\n\nIn Antarctica, sea ice extent is the third lowest on record for this month.\n\nWith input from AFP\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
