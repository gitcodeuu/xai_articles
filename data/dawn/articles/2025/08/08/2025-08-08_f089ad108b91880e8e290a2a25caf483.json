  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A day after the flooding in Chattha Bakhtawar, the city managers on Thursday swung into action and sealed 30 commercial buildings in the area.\n\nThe building control section backed by Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration conducted an operation and sealed the 30 buildings in the “hostel city” area.\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the ICT administration, the 30 buildings were sealed for the violation of building codes.\n\nIt said that the AC rural supervised the operation and also removed encroachments in the area.\n\nAt this stage, we can’t say if these buildings were constructed in the right of way of nullah, says CDA official\n\nThe statement said Islamabad police were also present on the occasion, and owners of the buildings had already been issued notices.\n\nIt is relevant to note here that the hostel city is located on the bank of Gumra Kas nullah near Chattha Bakhtawar.\n\nThe unplanned Chattha Bakhtawar faced flooding as rainwater entered into several streets, causing problems for the residents.\n\nMassive construction has taken place in this area during the last 20 years and so as the CDA never made any serious attempts to stop the activity.\n\nResidential houses and commercial buildings were constructed without approval of the building plans. There are also chances that construction allegedly took place in the right of way of the nullah.\n\n“There is a need for a proper demarcation of land of all nullahs from independent revenue officers as the involvement of ICT and CDA revenue officials behind the illegal construction in the right of ways of nullahs could not be ruled out,” said an official.\n\nWhen contacted, an official of the CDA building control wing said the commercial buildings were sealed as they were constructed without approval of the building plans. Asked if the buildings were constructed in the right of way of the nullah, he said: “At this stage, we can’t say whether these buildings were constructed in ROW. When the owners will come to the CDA for approval of their building plans, we will check documents of their land.”\n\nHe added that around 10 more building in the hostel city would be sealed in coming days.\n\nMeanwhile, a number of residents of Chattha Bakhtawar on Thursday staged a protest demonstration, demanding the government for pavement of their streets and providing other basic facilities.\n\nBesides Gumra Kas, there are also alleged reports about construction in the ROW of nullah Korang, which enters Islamabad from Murree side and culminates in Rawal Dam.\n\nDuring the last one decade, heavy construction took place along the nullah and there is a need for a proper demarcation of land as in Satra Meel, Bhara Kahu and Banigala, there are hundreds of buildings on the bank of this nullah.\n\nIn the downstream area after Rawal Dam, an illegal housing scheme has also been developed on the bank of the nullah.\n\nSimilarly, illegal constructions have also taken place in the right of way of the nullah in Saidpur.\n\n“If actions are not taken to end alleged encroachments in right of way of nullahs, in coming years tragedies can’t be avoided,” said an official.\n\nRecently, flash flood swept away three cars and several motorbikes in Saidpur. In DHA-5, a retired army officer and his daughter lost their lives when Sowan River swept away their car.\n\nAnti-encroachment drive\n\nMeanwhile, a meeting chaired by Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa was informed that “A vigorous campaign against illegal constructions and encroachments is ongoing in various sectors of Islamabad. In addition to reclaiming over 60 kanals of estate land from illegal occupants in the Saidpur area, strict operations were also carried out against encroachments and illegal constructions along GT Road,” said a press release.\n\nFurthermore, actions were taken against encroachments on the Expressway, Srinagar Highway, Tarnol and other areas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
