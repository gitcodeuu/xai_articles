  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The embassy of Uzbekistan hosted a media briefing on Thursday, reaffirming the country’s deepening commitment to strengthening ties with Pakistan across political, economic, cultural and humanitarian spheres.\n\nAddressing mediapersons, Uzbek Ambassador Alisher Tukhtaev outlined major achievements and upcoming initiatives driving Uzbek-Pakistani cooperation.\n\nThe ambassador noted that the relationship between Uzbekistan and Pakistan had evolved into a dynamic, strategic collaboration grounded in shared history, culture and mutual respect.\n\nA focal point of the discussion was the continued high-level political dialogue between the two nations. Highlighting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s landmark visit to Uzbekistan in February, the ambassador recalled the signing of several key agreements and the establishment of a strategic partnership council.\n\nA jointly developed “Roadmap” now guided the implementation of these initiatives with leaders maintaining regular interaction on international platforms such as the ECO summit and the Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly.\n\nAlisher Tukhtaev placed particular emphasis on regional connectivity, notably the Trans-Afghan Railway Project.\n\nA trilateral framework agreement signed in Kabul this July between Uzbekistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan marked a significant step towards materializing this vital corridor.\n\nAccording to the ambassador, economic cooperation featured prominently with encouraging signs of growth. In 2024, bilateral trade exceeded $400 million, and in the first half of 2025 alone, trade reached $253.7 million - a 123 per cent increase from the same period last year. Over 130 joint ventures now operated in Uzbekistan with Pakistani investment.\n\n“However, both sides aim higher, targeting $2 billion in annual trade in the near future. A Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA) is underway to expand the list of goods and reduce tariffs, while trade houses in Lahore and Karachi are strengthening on-ground presence,” he said.\n\nMade in Uzbekistan and Food Fest Uzbekistan held in Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi fostered over $120 million in trade deals. “Banking collaborations are also progressing, with Uzbek and Pakistani financial institutions exploring mutual payment solutions,” he added.\n\nBeyond economics, the briefing shed light on a flourishing cultural and humanitarian exchange. With the easing of visa regimes and the launch of direct flights between Tashkent and both Lahore and Islamabad, tourism and educational linkages were growing rapidly.\n\n“Joint events - ranging from cultural exhibitions and Nowruz celebrations to youth entrepreneurship forums and inter-governmental visits - have showcased a shared heritage. Initiatives such as the Central Asia Tour 2025 by Pakistani bikers symbolised the people-to-people warmth underpinning bilateral ties,” he said.\n\nThe envoy urged Pakistani stakeholders to explore Uzbekistan’s investment-friendly climate, highlighting incentives such as low taxes, special economic zones, skilled workforce and regional market access.\n\n“Uzbekistan is open for business and travel,” the ambassador said, inviting Pakistani entrepreneurs, tourists and cultural ambassadors to actively participate in building a robust and long-lasting partnership between the two brotherly nations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
