  "content": "LAHORE: The Punjab government has extended the summer vacation for all public and private schools across the province until Aug 31 with institutions set to reopen on Sept 1.\n\nThe decision, announced through an official notification by the School Education Department on Wednesday, supersedes the previous directive to resume classes on Aug 14.\n\nAccording to the notification, all district education authorities (DEAs) have been instructed to ensure strict compliance with the revised schedule. The extension comes amid ongoing extreme weather conditions in the province, though the notification did not explicitly cite a reason for the decision.\n\nThis marks the second adjustment to the academic calendar this summer. Parents and students are advised to note the revised date, while school administrations are expected to adjust their academic plans accordingly.\n\nThe Punjab government has not yet indicated whether the extended break will affect the overall academic year schedule or examinations.\n\nPunjab School Education minister Rana Sikandar Hayat also tweeted about extension of summer vacations.\n\n“Schools in Punjab will be opened from Sept 1,” he tweeted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 8th, 2025",
