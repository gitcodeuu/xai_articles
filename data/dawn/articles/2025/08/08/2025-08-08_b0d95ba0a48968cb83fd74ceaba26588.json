Operating under the provincial police department, the Punjab CTD plays a key role in maintaining internal security and countering terrorism within the country.\n\nIn a statement today, the law enforcement agency said, “Punjab CTD killed two terrorists during an operation near Kundian in Mianwali.”\n\nIt said that the CTD acted on a tip-off after receiving intelligence that the terrorists were planning to attack police and other institutions.\n\n“During the operation, the CTD and terrorists engaged in an exchange of fire, as a result of which two terrorists were killed by their own accomplices, while six of them managed to escape.”\n\nAccording to the statement, the CTD recovered “explosive materials, two rifles, hand grenades and bullets” from the terrorists.\n\n“The terrorists had completed their plans to target the police and other institutions,” it said.\n\nThe CTD spokesperson said that the process of identifying the two terrorists was underway, while a search operation was launched to arrest the terrorists who escaped.\n\nPunjab CTD was “diligently pursuing its goal of a safe Punjab and is committed to uprooting the menace of terrorism”, the statement added.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.\n\nThe country ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.\n\nLast month, Punjab CTD killed five terrorists and successfully thwarted a terror plot in Taunsa Sharif in a “major counter-terrorism breakthrough”.\n\nIn April, the law enforcement agency foiled major attacks by arresting 10 terrorists belonging to banned organisations during 189 operations in different areas of Punjab.",
