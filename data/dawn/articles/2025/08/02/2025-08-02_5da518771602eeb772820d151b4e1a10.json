A few hours later, the girl was also found near Clock Tower at the beach.\n\nThey were identified as Ahmed, 9, and Ayat, 5, and their father as Aurangzeb Alam.\n\nThe bodies were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.\n\nLosing custody battle led to extreme action: police\n\nThe officials believe that the man, along with his two children, tried to take their lives by jumping into the sea on Thursday afternoon, after losing the legal custody battle with his estranged wife.\n\nSouth DIG Syed Asad Raza said their relatives — the grandfather and brothers of the deceased man — arrived at Seaview in the morning. They identified the boy and the girl as siblings and the missing man as their father.\n\nThe officer said that he and his wife often quarrelled about domestic issues and started living separately. He said the estranged wife had filed an application before court seeking custody of the children. The hearing of the case took place on Thursday and the judge gave the ruling in favour of the mother.\n\nIn the meantime, the father managed to take his son and daughter for lunch at an eatery on Burns Road. From Burns Road, they came to the Seaview, where he jumped into the sea along with the kids, he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 2nd, 2025",
