RPO Khan also met with the relatives of the injured and assured them of full support.\n\nChildren playing with explosives, thinking they are toys, is not a new phenomenon.\n\nIn October 2023, a child lost his life while eight others were injured when a hand grenade exploded in the Zarchain area of Balochistan’s Wadh city.\n\nThe month before, nine people, including four children, lost their lives while a woman was injured when a “rocket launcher’s” ordnance exploded in a house in Sindh’s Kashmore district.",
