Another passenger could be heard asking, “Why did you slap him? You don’t have the right to hit anybody, do you understand?”\n\nA crew member was also heard telling the accused, “Don’t do that.”\n\nThe reason behind the assault remains unknown for now, and investigations are ongoing. However, the video sparked outrage across social media, with many calling for strict action against the attacker.\n\nThe consensus across social media was that the victim had been hit because he was a “visible Muslim”, causing the conversation to turn to slamming “hate politics” and religious divides.\n\nAccording to the Hindustan Times, one user on X wrote, “This isn’t society collapsing, it’s decades of hate politics finally reaching cruising altitude.”\n\nAnother commented, “What level of harassment and abuse is this? Just slapping a guy because he was a visible Muslim? What action have you taken against him? He should be behind bars and banned from travelling.”\n\nAnother comment said, “What right does that person have to hit anyone? Pathetic!”\n\nUpon landing in Kolkata, the attacker was handed over to security personnel at the airport. The Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) took the individual into custody for further investigation.\n\nIndiGo condemned the incident and confirmed that it would initiate action under unruly flyer rules, which may include a temporary no-fly ban. The airline emphasised its commitment to passenger safety and respectful conduct on all flights.\n\nThe airline declared the individual as “unruly” and stated that relevant aviation security agencies had been informed in line with protocol.\n\nIndiGo said in a post on X, “Such unruly behaviour is completely unacceptable, and we strongly condemn any actions that compromise the safety and dignity of our passengers and crew.”\n\nThe airline added, “We remain committed to maintaining a safe and respectful environment on all our flights.”\n\nIn May, the Association for Protection of Civil Rights (APCR), which is based in New Delhi, reported 184 hate crimes targeted at Muslims all over India between April 27 and May 8 in the aftermath of the Pahalgam terror attack.",
