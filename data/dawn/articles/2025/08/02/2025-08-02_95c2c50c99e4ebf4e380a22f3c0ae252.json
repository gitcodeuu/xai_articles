  "content": "NEW DELHI: Two vessels loaded with Russian oil bound for refiners in India have diverted to other destinations following new US sanctions, trade sources said on Friday.\n\nThe US Treasury Department this week imposed sanctions on more than 115 Iran-linked individuals, entities, and ships, some of which are involved in transporting Russian oil.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has urged countries to halt purchases of oil from Moscow, threatening 100 per cent tariffs unless Russia agrees to a significant peace deal with Ukraine.\n\nThree ships — the Aframaxes Tagor, Guanyin and the Suezmax Tassos — were scheduled to deliver Russian oil to Indian ports this month, trade sources said. All three vessels are under US sanctions.\n\nThe Tagor was bound for Chennai on India’s southeastern coast, while Guanyin and Tassos were headed to ports in western India.\n\nTighter Western sanctions aimed at cutting Russia’s oil revenue, seen as funding its war against Ukraine, have been increasingly hitting Russian oil supplies for India, which buys more than a third of its oil needs from Russia.\n\nThe Tagor is now heading to Dalian in China, while Tassos is diverting to Port Said in Egypt.\n\nThe third ship, Guanyin, remains on course to Sikka, a port used by Reliance Industries and Bharat Petroleum Corp.\n\nZulu Shipping, linked to Panama-flagged Tassos and Tagor, and Guanyin-owner Silver Tetra Marine could not be reached for comments. Both companies are under US sanctions.\n\nA Reliance spokesperson said that “neither of these two vessels, Guanyin and Tassos, is coming to us”.\n\nSeparately, two other vessels, Achilles and Elyte, loaded with Russian oil, are preparing to discharge Russian oil for Reliance.\n\nBoth these vessels are sanctioned by Britain and the European Union. India has condemned the EU sanctions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 2nd, 2025",
