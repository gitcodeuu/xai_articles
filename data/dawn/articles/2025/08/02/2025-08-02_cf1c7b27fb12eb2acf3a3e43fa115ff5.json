Key attendees included PML-N leader Malik Hameed Akbar, Additional Deputy Commissioner General Anil Saeed, Assistant Commissioner Anza Abbasi, including members of trade unions, Attock Bar Association and welfare organisations.\n\nDuring the briefing, officials highlighted that under the new rules, birth and death registration was now completely free throughout Punjab. Citizens will also receive computerised birth and death certificates free of charge.\n\nThe seminar also highlighted children’s rights under Article 25-A of the Constitution, ensuring free and compulsory education for children aged 5-16, protection from abuse, child labour, trafficking, and early marriage under provincial laws. Children also have the right to health and survival, including quality nutrition and a safe environment, with government programs such as vaccination and primary healthcare.\n\nAddressing the participants, ADC General Anil Saeed emphasised that the Punjab government had made the registration process significantly more citizen-friendly. He revealed that the Punjab government has officially implemented new regulations aimed at improving the process of registering births and deaths across the province.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Anza Abbasi, speaking on this occasion, said that identity is the fundamental right of every citizen. We are committed to making public services more accessible.\n\n“Digital birth and death certificates are essential for accessing many services, and timely registration ensures citizens can fully secure their rights.” She added.\n\nAddressing the participants, Deputy Director of Local Government Khawaja Hassan has said that the new rules eliminate the need for a court decree for late registrations, significantly streamlining the process for citizens. He said that births and deaths can now be registered free of charge at union councils and municipal committees for up to seven years from the date of occurrence.\n\nAddressing the participants, PML-N leader Malik Hameed Akbar said that under the initiative of the Punjab chief minister, computerised birth and death certificates will also be issued free.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 2nd, 2025",
