The court also ordered the forfeiture of his property.\n\nWarrants out for 18 PTI leaders\n\nSeparately, an ATC in Rawalpindi issued arrest warrants for 18 senior PTI leaders in a case linked to the Wah Cantt protest on Nov 26, 2024.\n\nThose named include Khyber Pakh­tu­nkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Ganda­pur; Aleema Khan, the sister of jailed ex-premier Imran Khan; former provincial minister Ijaz Khan Jazi; former federal minister Sheikh Waqas Akram; and former MNA Kanwal Shozab.\n\nThe court ordered police to apprehend the accused and present them on Aug 8, also summoning the investigating officer with the complete case record.\n\nProsecutors told the court that the accused were “deliberately evading arrest and ignoring repeated court summons, thereby obstructing the legal proceedings.”\n\nProsecutor Zaheer Abbas argued that the accused’s continued absence was “affecting the judicial process and undermining the rule of law.”\n\nThe court also took up an application seeking cancellation of bail for 68 accused in a related case, issuing notices to their sureties and adjourning proceedings until August 5.\n\nThe ATC warned that legal action would be taken not only against absconding individuals but also against those who provided bail sureties if the accused fail to appear.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 2nd, 2025",
