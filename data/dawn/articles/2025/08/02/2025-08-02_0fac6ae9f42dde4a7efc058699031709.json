  "content": "LONDON: Prasidh Krishna and Mohammed Siraj took four wickets each as India fought back in the fifth and deciding Test against England at the Oval on Friday.\n\nEngland were 129-1 in reply to India’s 224 all out as they threatened to build a substantial first-innings lead. But they were dismissed for 247, just 23 runs ahead, following a rain delay.\n\nIn a match India must win to end the series level at 2-2, the recalled Krishna had figures of 4-62 in 16 overs and fellow paceman Siraj 4-86 in 16.2.\n\nZak Crawley and Ben Duckett shared a blistering first-wicket stand of 92 in just 13 overs after England paceman Gus Atkinson marked his return to Test cricket with a five-wicket haul.\n\nBoth openers fell either side of lunch, however, before stand-in England captain Ollie Pope, leading the side in place of injured Ben Stokes, was lbw to Siraj for 22.\n\nCrawley and Duckett dominated India’s attack with a blizzard of boundaries before Akash Deep sparked the latest flare-up of a fractious series.\n\nDeep had Duckett caught behind for 43 off an attempted scoop, then put his arm round the unimpressed batsman’s shoulder and appeared to say a few words as he walked off.\n\nIndia’s K.L. Rahul pulled Deep away from Duckett before the bowler could say anything else.\n\nAter Duckett’s exit, Crawley holed out off a miscued pull against Krishna for 64, with 56 of those runs coming in boundaries.\n\nJoe Root found himself exchanging words with Krishna before he was lbw to Siraj for 29.\n\nAnd when Siraj had Jacob Bet­hell lbw as the all-rounder played down the wrong line, England were 195-5. Jamie Smith then saw his edged drive off Krishna well caught by Rahul at second slip. Four balls later Jamie Overton was lbw to Krishna for a duck. Atki­nson hit two boundaries bef­ore he mistimed a pull off Krishna.\n\nHarry Brook played an extraordinary ‘falling’ sweep for six off Siraj during a 57-ball fifty. But Siraj bowled him for 53, with Brook the last man out as injured Chris Woakes was unable to bat.\n\nEngland suffered a setback before Friday’s play, with paceman Woakes effectively ruled out of the rest of the match after suffering a shoulder injury on Thursday. But Atkinson respon­d­ed with 5-33 in 21.4 overs after striking twice on Thursday, when he also ran out Gill.\n\nThe 27-year-old’s fourth five-wicket haul in just 13 Tests was all the more creditable as this was Atkinson’s first senior match since being sidelined with hamstring trouble following a one-off Test against Zimbabwe in May.\n\nIndia, who resumed on 204-6, lost their last four wickets for just 20 more runs in 5.4 overs on Friday.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nINDIA (1st Innings, overnight 204-6):\n\nY.
