  "content": "KARACHI: Bank Makra­­mah Ltd (BML) has repor­ted a profit before tax of Rs1.44 billion and an after-tax profit of Rs707 million for the half year ended June 30 — its first profit in more than a decade, the bank said in a press release issued on Friday.\n\nThe results, approved by the board of directors at its meeting, reflect a significant turnaround from the Rs2.44bn loss before tax recorded in the same period last year — an improvement of Rs3.88bn.\n\nBML Chairman Abdulla Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah attributed the bank’s performance to improved net mark-up income, recoveries of legacy non-performing loans, gains from treasury operations, and a better deposit mix that helped lower the average cost of funds.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 2nd, 2025",
