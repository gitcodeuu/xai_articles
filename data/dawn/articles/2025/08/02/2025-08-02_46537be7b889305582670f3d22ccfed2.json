Bilateral relati­o­ns between Pakistan and UAE have always sto­od the test of time and circumstances,” Mr Sharif said.\n\nMaryam Nawaz said: “We are keen to further expand cooperation with the UAE in fields of education, research and environment. Visa-free entry for official and diplomatic passport holders between Pakistan and UAE is commendable,” she said, highlighting the need for increase in bilateral trade volume.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 2nd, 2025",
