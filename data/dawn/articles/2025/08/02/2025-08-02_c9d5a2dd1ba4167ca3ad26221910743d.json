  "content": "PESHAWAR: The police on Friday used tear gas to disperse a large number of government employees, who were protesting outside the provincial assembly against the denial of 30 per cent disparity reduction alliance in line with the announcement of the federal government.\n\nThe protest was arranged by All Government Employees Grand Alliance (AGEGA) and a large number of employees from across the government departments took part in the protest.\n\nThe protesters walked on the GT Road to reach the Surey Pul Chowk at the junction of Justice Rustam Kiyani and Khyber roads. However, when the protesters tried to march towards the Khyber Road, police used tear gas to disperse them.\n\nAll Primary Teachers Association, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa president Azizullah Khan told Dawn that police not only used heavy tear gas to disperse their peaceful protest but also arrested at least three persons.\n\nHe said that the protesters dispersed after they were tear-gassed.\n\nHe said that currently AGEGA leaders were meeting to chalk out their future course of action. Besides, Mr Khan said their meeting with a government committee was scheduled for August 7.\n\nHowever, he said the provincial government had in June promised giving them same disparity reduction allowance as the federal government employees were getting.\n\nHowever, he said instead of delivering on its promise, the government notified a 15 per cent raise in disparity reduction alliance, which forced them to take to the streets again.\n\nHe said that a five-member government committee formed in June did not play its role in resolving the issue.\n\nMr Khan said that they would announce a future course of action after the meeting of the leadership.\n\nOn June 23, police had used tear gas to disperse the AGEGA protest from outside the provincial assembly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 2nd, 2025",
