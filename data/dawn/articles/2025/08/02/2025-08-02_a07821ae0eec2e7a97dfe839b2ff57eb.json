  "content": "SUKKUR: A container-mounted trailer ran over five labourers, sleeping on a roadside pavement near Babarloi Bypass in Khairpur district, in the early hours of Thursday, killing four of them. The only survivor was stated to be in a critical condition.\n\nThe victims — Gul Mohammad, Deedar, Wazeer, Sadoror and Zafar — were sleeping on the pavement of Nasir Ali Shah Chowk after their day-long work on a nearby date palm farm. According to the Babarloi police, the trailer driver could not see them due to darkness, pointing out that the accident took place at about 3:45am.\n\nThey said Gul Mohammad, Deedar and Wazeer died on the spot while Sadoror and Zafar were rushed to the Khairpur Civil Hospital in a critical condition. Zafar succumbed to his injuries during treatment, they said, adding that Sadoror was fighting for life at the hospital.\n\nThe unknown trailer driver had already fled the area when a police party reached the accident site.\n\nThe vehicle was, however, impounded.\n\nAll the victims were residents of the Wazirabad area of Shikarpur district and belonged to the Manganhar community.\n\nThe bodies were handed over to the heirs after medico-legal formalities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 2nd, 2025",
