  "content": "QUETTA: Reko Diq Mining Company (RDMC) has launched a community mentorship programme to equip young men and women in villages near its copper-gold project in Balochistan with the skills needed to enter the workforce.\n\nThe Community Mentorship Training Programme, part of RDMC’s commitment to local talent development, is designed to bridge the gap between vocational education and real-world employment.\n\nSo far, more than 114 people have participated in sessions held within their communities.\n\nConducted by the company’s human resources department, the initiative provides young people from villages such as Humai, Durbin Chah, and Tang Kachao with practical, career-oriented guidance.\n\nThe training includes interactive sessions on CV writing, interview techniques, professional communication, and workplace conduct.\n\nA key focus of the program is the inclusion of women, with dedicated sessions organised to help them prepare for future employment opportunities at RDMC.\n\n“At RDMC, we believe that the true value of our operations lies not just in developing the mine, but in creating meaningful opportunities for the people of Balochistan — especially our neighbouring villages and the wider Chagai district,” said Inayatullah, the Human Resources Lead at RDMC.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 10th, 2025",
