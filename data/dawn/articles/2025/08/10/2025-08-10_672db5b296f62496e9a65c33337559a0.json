  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Work has begun to demolish a cinema house, about 75 years old, on Liaquat Road for the construction of a commercial plaza. However, traders in the area have demanded that the demolition be stopped.\n\nThe cinema house was constructed in 1950 and continued screening movies until 2000. It was later closed due to a legal dispute between two individuals who both claimed to be the rightful owners.\n\nAt that time, a general transport terminal operated next to Liaquat Bagh, and moviegoers would often catch the last show at Nishat Cinema before departing for cities like Lahore.\n\nDemolition work began on Friday, but on Saturday, Maimuna Bano, who claims to be the owner of the cinema, along with President of Imperial Market Mohammad Rafique Shah, business leader Jaji Dilawar Khan and their lawyer Barrister Luqman Bajori, addressed a press conference at the Rawalpindi Press Club with traders, demanding an immediate halt to the demolition.\n\nMaimuna Bano said Nishat Cinema is their legitimate property and over 18 marlas of its land had been occupied by another group. She said she was fed up with the prolonged legal battle and was now compelled to stage a sit-in with traders in Raja Bazaar.\n\nLocal traders urged the government to take immediate notice of the matter, warning that otherwise, the business community would be forced to shut down Raja Bazaar and protest.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 10th, 2025",
