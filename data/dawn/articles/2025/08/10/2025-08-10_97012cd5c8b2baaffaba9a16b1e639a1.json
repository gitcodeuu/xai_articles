  "content": "KARACHI: Police on Saturday registered a terrorism case against four unidentified persons who opened fire on people sitting outside a police check post near Qayumabad on Friday night, resulting in the death of one civilian and bullet wounds to a policeman and another civilian.\n\nKorangi SSP (Investigation) Muhammad Qais Khan told Dawn that the Korangi Industrial Area police had registered a case under terrorism and murder charges against the suspects and an investigation has been launched to arrest them.\n\nInspector General of Police Sindh Ghulam Nabi Memon told Dawn that it was “too early” to confirm whether the incident was an act of terrorism. However, he added that “it [terrorism] cannot be ruled out, given the manner in which it was executed.”\n\nHe said the police and Counter-Terrorism Department were working to apprehend the culprits.\n\nThe wounded policeman, Mohammed Hanif, who is also the complainant in the case, said that he lives in the Kharadar police lines and serves as a constable in the police department and is posted in Malir district. He had recently completed a lower school course, with his passing out parade held on August 5, 2025.\n\nOn Friday night, while riding his motorcycle to meet friends in Korangi, his bike developed a fault near the Sajid Zaman police post, located inside Malir Nadi on Korangi Crossing Road. As there was no motorcycle mechanic nearby, he brought his bike outside the police post and called his friend, mechanic Abbas Mushtaq.\n\n“We were sitting on chairs outside the police post and chatting when suddenly four suspects, riding two motorcycles and wearing shalwar-kameez, began firing at us with the intention of killing and spreading terror,” the FIR says.\n\nAs a result, the complainant, his friend Abbas, and a passerby named Saddam Husain sustained bullet wounds and were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre in ambulances. Abbas was pronounced dead on arrival, while Saddam Husain was in critical condition and unable to give a statement to police. Hanif suffered a leg injury.\n\nPolice have registered a case under Sections 302 (murder), 324 (attempted murder), 34 (common intention), and 7-ATA (Anti-Terrorism Act) against the suspects.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 10th, 2025",
