No undesirable event has been flagged up till now,” Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X.\n\nTurkey is crisscrossed by several geological fault lines, which have previously caused catastrophes in the country.\n\nA quake in February 2023 in the southwest killed at least 53,000 people and devastated Antakya, the site of the ancient city of Antioch.\n\nMore recently, a 5.8-magnitude tremor in the same region resulted in one death and injured 69 people at the beginning of July.",
