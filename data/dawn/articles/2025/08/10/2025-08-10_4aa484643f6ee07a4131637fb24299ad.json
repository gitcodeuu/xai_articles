Noor hit back in the fourth game, taking it 13-11 before Rodriguez clinched the decisive fifth game 11-6.\n\nHe will now have to contend with the special plate event with a quarter-final against Egyptian Mohammad Nasser on Sunday.\n\nNasir advanced to the quarter-finals of the plate event a day after falling in the first round. He crushed Austrian Daniel Lutz 11-7, 11-4, 11-8 to set up a last-eight match against Romanian Radu Pena.\n\n“Nasir played smart squash today, controlling the match from the start,” Fahim said. “He’s determined to make the most of this opportunity.”\n\nThe multi-sport World Games feature non-Olympic sports although Squash is set to make its Olympic debut at Los Angeles 2028.\n\nElsewhere on Saturday, the three-day tug-of-war competitions kicked off with Britain’s men’s 640kg team clinching gold after a dominant performance against reigning champion Switzerland.\n\nIn canoeing, Denmark’s Mads Brandt Pedersen took gold in the men’s K1 short distance event while Sweden’s Melina Andersson took the women’s race.\n\nAlso at the Xinglong Lake Hubin Arena, Dragon boat made its debut as an official sport with Indonesia claiming the first gold medal in the open 8-seater 2,000m pursuit race.\n\nOver at the Dong’an Lake Sports Park Multifunctional Gymnasium, China captured the women’s group title in acrobatic gymnastics while Alexey Glukhov and Anastasia Glazunova of Moldova won the standard dance event.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 10th, 2025",
