  "content": "LAHORE: While the PTI has decided to boycott upcoming by-polls in Punjab, the PML-N provincial chapter held a meeting here on Saturday to finalise candidates and discuss a strategy for a win.\n\nThe PML-N provincial leadership, led by Rana Sanaullah, is focused on planning and preparations for the upcoming by-election and expected local government polls. Sanaullah instructed the party leaders to complete the organisational structure and ensure full electoral preparedness at all levels. The participants in the meeting expressed full confidence in the leadership and performance of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.\n\n“Both the federal and Punjab governments are working under Nawaz Sharif’s guidance to serve the public with dedication and sincerity,” Sanaullah said and added that the party would soon announce ‘suitable candidates’ for the by-polls.\n\nPunjab Minister for Information Azma Bokhari said the PML-N’s parliamentary board held an in-depth discussion on by-elections and internal party organisation.\n\n“PML-N’s ticket has now become a hot cake with nearly 15 aspirants vying for each seat,” she claimed and said that the final decision party ticket-holders rested solely with Nawaz Sharif.\n\nTwelve PTI lawmakers in Punjab have been disqualified by the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) following their conviction in the May 9, 2023 cases. The disqualified lawmakers comprise eight National Assembly and four Punjab Assembly legislators. The NA-129, Lahore, fell vacant on the death of MNA and former governor Mian Azhar.\n\nPTI patron-in-chief Imran Khan has barred his party from contesting the by-polls except on NA-129 where Azhar’s son Hammad Azhar is likely to be the party’s candidate.\n\n“We will not field any candidates in the by-elections for the seats of our unjustly disqualified members. These individuals stood firm with PTI despite extreme challenges. Therefore, the party will completely boycott these by-elections,” Mr Khan had said in a recent tweet.\n\nAzma Bokhari claimed the PTI had already fled the by-election arena. “The PTI is unable to find candidates willing to face PML-N in the field,” she added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 10th, 2025",
