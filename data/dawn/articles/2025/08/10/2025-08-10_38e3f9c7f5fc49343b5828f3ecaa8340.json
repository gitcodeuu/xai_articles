  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB) has increased water and conservancy charges by 40 to 70 per cent, triggering unrest among residents of the cantonment areas, who have demanded the decision be withdrawn.\n\nPakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Member National Assembly (MNA) from cantonment and the party’s divisional president Malik Ibrar Ahmed lashed out at the RCB bureaucracy for putting more financial pressure on residents, saying the party had directed its elected members on the board to either work to reduce the charges or resign.\n\nA senior RCB official told Dawn that there was initially a plan to raise water and conservancy charges by 300 per cent, but due to resistance from elected members, the board decided to approve an increase of 40 to 70 per cent for the fiscal year 2025–26.\n\nHe said the cost of Khanpur Dam water from the Sangjani Filtration Plant, electricity rates and other expenses had increased manifold, making it difficult for the civic body to manage its affairs, prompting the decision.\n\nCivic body cites surge in operational costs and other expenses for increase in charges\n\nAccording to him, two categories have been set for water charges, including a 40 per cent increase for consumers with three, five and seven marla houses and a 70 per cent increase for houses over 10 marlas and for commercial entities.\n\nThe RCB has also raised charges for commercial outlets and will sign agreements with major malls, factories and businesses for sanitation services.\n\nInstitutions not receiving cleaning services from the board will be exempt from conservancy charges.\n\nThe cantonment area currently has 52,000 water connections, including 42,000 for small residential units, 6,000 for larger homes and 4,000 for commercial use. Water is drawn from Khanpur Dam and tube wells installed at various locations in the cantonment.\n\nResidents, however, rejected the RCB’s justification, saying water rationing is routine and supply is provided only on alternate days for a few minutes, yet bills have been increased. They added that despite paying bills to RCB, most people rely on private tankers for daily needs as the civic body provides inadequate water.\n\nFor the past few years, residents said, RCB has been increasing charges indiscriminately without ensuring adequate supply.\n\nWestridge resident Shahid Mumtaz said the civic body has failed to provide water year-round, yet charges residents for the whole year, calling it “totally unjustified.”\n\nAnother Westridge resident said he paid Rs27,000 in 2024 but received a bill of Rs56,100 for 2025, with a note stating it was a provisional bill subject to a new assessment and any balance due would have to be paid.\n\nIn the past, RCB increased house tax, water and conservancy charges every three years, but the hikes have now become an annual occurrence, with charges based on plot size rather than usage. Resident Nayyar Ali said people were willing to pay for every drop if a metering system was introduced, as it would prevent overcharging.\n\nRCB Cantonment Executive Officer Syed Ali Irfan was not available for comment. However, an RCB official said the increase was mainly due to higher electricity costs, as water from Khanpur Dam is stored in 18 underground tanks and pumped to residents, while tube wells also require electricity to run.\n\nMalik Ibrar Ahmed said that during last month’s board meeting, officials proposed a 300 per cent increase in charges, but RCB Vice President Malik Munir and elected members opposed it. He said the PML-N had told its members to work on reducing the charges or be ready to resign, adding, “We want to provide relief to the residents.”\n\nHe criticised civic body officials for creating unnecessary hurdles for people in resolving their civic issues, accusing them of fostering corruption. He vowed to raise the matter in the National Assembly and with the PML-N leadership.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 10th, 2025",
