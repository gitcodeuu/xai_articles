Our numbers are already growing for the next wave of action in September,” it added.\n\nAttendees began massing near parliament at lunchtime bearing signs saying “oppose genocide, support Palestine Action” and other slogans, and waving Palestinian flags.\n\nAs police moved in on the demonstrators, they applauded those being arrested and shouted “shame on you” at officers.\n\n“Let them arrest us all,” said Richard Bull, 42, a wheelchair-user in attendance.\n\nThe London force noted some of those there were onlookers or not visibly supporting the group.\n\nNGOs opposed\n\nThe Met police also detailed how the hundreds arrested were taken to temporary “prisoner processing” points, where their details were confirmed and they were either instantly bailed or taken into custody elsewhere.\n\nAmnesty International UK Chief Executive Sacha Deshmukh wrote to Met Police chief Mark Rowley this week urging restraint be exercised when policing people holding placards expressing support for Palestine Action.\n\nA UK court challenge against the decision to proscribe Palestine Action will be heard later this year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 10th, 2025",
