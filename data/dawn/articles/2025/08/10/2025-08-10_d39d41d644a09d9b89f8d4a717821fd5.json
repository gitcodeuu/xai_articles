Quoting relatives, she said the deceased girl was to get married soon.\n\nDr Summaiya said police brought in two drivers with critical injuries after they were beaten by the mob. She said the alleged errant driver was critically injured but stable, while a driver of another burnt dumper was also in critical condition with head injuries.\n\nRescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan confirmed that seven dumpers were torched near Lucky One Mall in Gulshan-i-Iqbal, adding that the fire tenders controlled the fire. “The heavy vehicles were badly damaged in arson acts,” he said.\n\nLater, a statement from Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon’s office stated that negotiations between the transporters and the provincial government were successful, with the former agreeing to end their demonstration.\n\nA delegation of transporters led by Haji Yousaf and Jam Alam met Memon at the Karachi Commissioner House.\n\nKarachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, Transport Secretary Asad Zamin and the city’s police chief, Javed Alam Odho, were also present on the occasion.\n\nThe statement added that Memon expressed condolences for those killed in the accident and condemned the “violent acts” that took place afterwards.\n\n“The Sindh government will prioritise resolving their (the transporters’) legitimate issues,” Memon was quoted as saying.\n\n“Violence and vandalism are not the solution to these problems. We will work with all parties to solve the problems of the transport sector and ensure that these incidents do not happen again.”\n\nMemon added that those who committed acts of vandalism and “took the law into their own hands” will be charged under anti-terrorism laws.\n\n“Dumper owners will ensure that their trucks are fitted with cameras and trackers, while they will have insurance and truck drivers’ licences,” Memon was quoted as saying. “A committee will be formed to assess the losses incurred by transporters.”\n\nEarlier this month, a high-speed trailer truck crashed in Karachi’s Defence Housing Authority (DHA), injuring two people.\n\nIn July, a 59-year-old milk supplier was killed when a dumper ran over his motorcycle in Karachi’s Saudabad.",
