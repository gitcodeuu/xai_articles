We have started reforms within the railways department, and people will benefit from it soon,” Abbasi said in a statement.\n\nThe minister directed the railway authorities to complete the restoration of the track, as trains scheduled to pass through the track were diverted.\n\nPakistan Railway Headquarters has called an emergency meeting for tomorrow, presided over by the railway minister. The minister said he will also visit the site of the accident.\n\nThe rest of the passengers were accommodated in an alternate train, according to the railway ministry.\n\nThe incident comes days after two coaches of the Peshawar-bound Awam Express derailed close to the Khanpur railway station near Rahim Yar Khan, leaving multiple passengers injured, while another Multan-bound Musa Pak Express also got off the track, raising questions about the safety of Pakistan railways.\n\nEarlier this month, at least 29 people were injured as an Islamabad Express passenger train derailed near Kala Shah Kaku in Punjab’s Sheikhupura district.\n\nThe incident also caused massive damage to the rolling stock and a large portion of the track.",
