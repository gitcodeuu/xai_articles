We want to have a solid foundation and build a competitive league that allows the talent in the country the opportunity to play.”\n\nSolano stressed he wanted to build a solid team that would play attacking football “to win games”.\n\nHis first assignment comes next month when Pakistan face hosts Cambodia, Iraq and Oman in Group ‘G’ in the qualifiers for the 2026 AFC Under-23 Asian Cup.\n\n“We need to focus and have a strong mentality,” he said. “We need to go to Cambodia and try to qualify [for the tournament finals].”\n\nThe 50-year-old said as a coach he will not stick to strict philosophy but use a formation that utilises the strengths of his players best.\n\n“I believe we can play different systems depending upon the players. We will know their strengths when we begin training.”\n\nThe camp for the Under-23 probables begins in Abbottabad from Sunday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
