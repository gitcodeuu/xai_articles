But despite cancellation a number of its workers were arrested.\n\nReaction over Tessori’s remarks\n\nSeparately, PTI has strongly condemned remarks by Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, alleging his comments were a “direct attack on democracy” and a grave insult to the people of Karachi.\n\nA PTI spokesperson said Mr Tessori’s recent remarks undermine the democratic process. He cited a comment from the governor, “Go ahead, vote again — what happened the last time?” as evidence.\n\nHe said such statements suggest elections are meaningless and that decisions are made by powerful and unelected quarters.\n\nHe stated that Tessori also asked people if they wanted the old MQM back, which he called “a clear reference to the return of Altaf Hussain’s style of politics, long associated with violence, fear, and extortion in Karachi”. He alleged the remarks exposed the MQM’s democratic posturing as a facade.\n\n“Tessori’s comments are part of a dangerous attempt to disillusion the public and erode their faith in the power of the vote,” the spokesperson added. “They are being used to justify the blatant rigging witnessed in the 2024 general elections.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
