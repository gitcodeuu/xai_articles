  "content": "TORONTO: Air Canada cancelled hundreds of flights on Saturday as it began shutting down operations in response to a strike by flight attendants — triggering summer travel chaos for its 130,000 daily passengers.\n\nCanada’s largest airline, which flies directly to 180 cities worldwide, urged customers not to go to the airport if they have a ticket for Air Canada or its lower-cost subsidiary Air Canada Rouge.\n\nIt said flights by Air Canada Express, which are operated by a third party, would not be impacted by the walkout. “Air Canada deeply regrets the effect the strike is having on customers,” the company said in a statement.\n\nThe Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE), which represents Air Canada’s 10,000 flight attendants, said that strike action officially began at 12:58 am local time (0458 GMT) on Saturday.\n\nIn response, Air Canada began a “lockout” of cabin crew belonging to CUPE, preventing the employees from working during the standoff fueled by a payment dispute. Air Canada had been gradually winding down operations ahead of the possible labor action.\n\nAs of 8pm Friday, the airline said it had cancelled 623 flights affecting more than 100,000 passengers. Its full 700-flight daily schedule has been scrapped for Saturday.“At this time, Air Canada remains engaged and committed to negotiate a renewal to its collective agreement with CUPE,” it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
