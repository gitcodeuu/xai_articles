The declaration called for the establishment of a judicial commission for the killing of ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb.\n\nExpressing regret over the flooding situation in KP, the MPC also postponed the ‘Islamabad Peace March’, previously scheduled for August 23.\n\n“The new date of the Islamabad Peace March would be decided through mutual consultation,” the statement said.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.\n\nEarlier in the week, Aimal said that the law and order in KP was deteriorating rapidly, and feared that the worsening situation in Bajaur may engulf the entire province.\n\nAround 55,000 people have been displaced from different areas of Mamund tehsil in Bajaur tribal district due to the military operation, while 400,000 residents remain hostage to the suddenly-imposed curfew, local lawmaker Nisar Baz had told the KP Assembly on Monday.",
