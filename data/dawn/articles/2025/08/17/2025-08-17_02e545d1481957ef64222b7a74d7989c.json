Scat­tered rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is also likely in Dera Ghazi Khan, Bhakkar, Layyah, Multan, Ba­­­­hawalpur, Bahawalnagar, Rajanpur, and Rahimyar Khan from August 18 to 20.\n\nIn Sindh, rain-wind/thundershower (with scattered heavy falls at times very heavy) is expected in Mithi, Tharparker, Umer Kot, Mirpurkhas, Hyderabad, Sha­heed Benazirabad, Karachi, Thatta, Bad­in, Sajawal, Tando Allayar, Tando Muh­a­mmad Khan, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, and Jacobabad from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps.\n\nIn Balochistan, rain-wind/thundershower (with isolated heavy falls) is expected in Barkhan, Musakhel, Loralai, Sibi, Zhob, Qilla Saifullah, Khuzdar, Lasbela, Awaran, Kech, Gwadar, and Panjgur from August 17 to 21.\n\nThe PMD said the downpour may generate flash floods in local nullahs and streams in different parts of KP, Punjab, and Kashmir from August 17 to 19, while flash floods in the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan and eastern parts of Baloch­istan from August 18 to 21 are also likely.\n\nUrban centres, including Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, and Gujranwala, may experience urban flooding from August 17 to 19, it said, adding that several cities in Sindh, including Karachi and Hyderabad, may experience the same from August 17 to 22 with occasional gaps. During the forecast period, landslides and mudslides may cause road closures in the hilly areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, Galiyat, and Kashmir.\n\nPunjab floods warning\n\nOn the other hand, Punjab’s Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) issued red alerts for multiple districts and warned about heavy flooding in the coming days due to an increase in water levels in reservoirs and rivers.\n\nThe Indus River is swelling to medium levels at Kalabagh and Chashma Barrage, while low-level flooding is ongoing at Tar­bela and Taunsa Barrage. Sutlej River is experiencing low-level flooding at Ganda Singh Wala, with a water flow of 68,000 cusecs. Jhelum River is flowing normal at key points and adjoining streams. Chenab River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding persists in Nullah Palkho (Cantonment). Ravi River’s flow is normal at key points, while low-level flooding continues in Nullah Basantar.\n\nTarbela Dam is 98 per cent full while Mangla Dam is 68pc full. India’s water releases, meanwhile, have increased to 50,000 cusecs.\n\nThe PDMA urged citizens, especially those living near riverbanks, to immediately move to safer locations, cooperate with the authorities concerned in case of emergency evacuations, and refrain from recreational activities near the rivers during flood conditions.\n\nThe PDMA also warned of heavy rainfall in most districts of Punjab, particularly the northern districts facing risks of torrential rains and cloudbursts. The seventh spell of monsoon rains is relatively stronger, with forecasts of severe downpours, it added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
