They also blocked the road for the general public.\n\nThe gathering was informed about Section 144 of the CrPC imposed in Islamabad, under which their assembly was unlawful and in violation of the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order Act, the FIR alleged.\n\n“They were asked to disperse peacefully; however, they attacked the police with batons, stones, iron rods and slingshots. They also beat policemen, snatched anti-riot gear from them and set the gear on fire.”\n\nThey beat and injured three police officials and tore the uniforms of two others.\n\nMore police contingents were called to the area, and later, 23 participants of the gathering were arrested, while the rest managed to escape. Those who were arrested told police that the ones who fled were workers and activists of the PTI.\n\nThey said they had received instructions from the local leadership of the PTI to continue the protest until the release of the party’s founder.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
