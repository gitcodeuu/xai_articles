The UN has warned the crisis would extend into the city itself by last May, although a lack of data has so far prevented an official famine declaration.\n\nThis month, the World Food Programme (WFP) said thousands of families trapped in El-Fasher are at “risk of starvation”.\n\nAccording to the WFP, prices for staple foods like sorghum and wheat — used to make traditional flatbreads and porridge — are up to 460 percent higher in El-Fasher compared to other parts of Sudan.\n\nMarkets and clinics have been attacked while community kitchens that once fed displaced families have largely shut down due to a lack of supplies, the UN agency added.\n\nNearly 40 percent of children under five in El-Fasher are now acutely malnourished, with 11 percent suffering from severe acute malnutrition, according to UN figures.\n\nMalnutrition has already claimed 63 lives — mostly women and children — in just one week in El-Fasher, a senior health official said last week.\n\nAt the city’s largest community kitchen, organisers say children and women arriving show clear signs of malnutrition, including swollen bellies and sunken eyes. The humanitarian crisis is being compounded by a cholera outbreak that is sweeping through overcrowded displacement camps.\n\nDoctors Without Borders (MSF) said on Thursday that Sudan is experiencing its worst cholera epidemic in years, fuelled by the ongoing conflict.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
