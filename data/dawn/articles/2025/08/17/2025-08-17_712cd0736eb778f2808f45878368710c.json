Guan had successfully reached the summit on Aug 11 with a group of climbers before beginning her descent.\n\nAccording to Karrar Haidri, senior vice president of the Alpine Club of Pakistan, the Chinese climber died of a head injury caused by falling rocks. The evacuation was carried out by Army Aviation, which transported the body by helicopter from Concordia.\n\nEarlier, a team of mountaineers had attempted the recovery on foot after poor weather had grounded helicopter operations. Guan Jing died on Aug 12, a day after summiting K2 with her group in Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nHer body was later found 100-150 metres above the Advanced Base Camp, at an altitude of around 5,400 metres. At 8,611 meters, K2 is considered one of the world’s most dangerous and technically challenging mountains, with a fatality rate far higher than that of Mount Everest.\n\nMr Haidri extended his deepest condolences to Guan Jing’s family, friends and the international mountaineering community, calling her loss “deeply tragic”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
