  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan’s new remote sensing satellite has successfully rea­c­hed orbit and begun operations, sources at the Spa­ce and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Su­­parco) said on Saturday.\n\nThe satellite was laun­ch­­ed from China’s Xich­ang lau­­nch centre on July 31.\n\nThe satellite has established stable communication links with ground stations and started acquiring high-resolution images for sending them to the ground.\n\nThis will make data available for various sectors of national life.\n\nThe satellite has high-quality imaging capabilities that will revolutionise urban planning and infrastructure development. It will also help monitor urban sprawl and development trends.\n\nIt will strengthen the na­­tural disaster prevention sys­­tem and enable rapid response by providing tim­ely data that could alert authorities to possibility of floods, landslides, earthquakes and other disasters.\n\nThe satellite will also play a role in environmental protection, such as monitoring melting of glaciers and deforestation.\n\nAccording to experts, it will help boost agricultural production.\n\nThe satellite is expected to play a key role in execution of development projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor, mapping transport networks, identifying geo-hazards and enabling the effective use of natural resources.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 17th, 2025",
