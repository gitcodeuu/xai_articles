  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaid­o­ng on Monday said “militarism and the rule of mi­ght” are not viable paths to peace, calling for a rejection of unilateralism and zero-sum approaches in global affairs.\n\nSpeaking at a symposium held to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the ‘Victory of the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japan­ese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War’, Amb Jiang emphasised the need to uphold the post-World War II international order amid rising geopolitical tensions.\n\n“Eighty years on, the world is still far from tranquil,” Jiang said. “Unila­t­e­ralism, protectionism, and hegemonism are running rampant; deficits in peace, development, security, and governance are growing.”\n\nHe criticised countries that “openly distort the his­tory of WWII, deny Chi­na’s historical contribution, challenge the One-China principle, and und­ermine international rule of law.”\n\nAmb Jiang also condemned actions that “generalise the concept of national security, provoke trade wars and technology wars, and disrupt the global economic order”.\n\nThe ambassador’s rema­rks come against a backdrop of escalating global tensions. In recent years, US-China relations have deteriorated over trade dis­­putes, technology res­t­rictions, and differing views on Taiwan.\n\nThe US and its allies have imposed sanctions on Chinese firms, citing nati­onal security concerns, while China has accused Western countries of suppressing its development.\n\nMeanwhile, Russia’s on­­going conflict in Ukraine and rising militarisation in the Indo-Pacific have further strained the post-WWII framework, with Nato and other alliances.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
