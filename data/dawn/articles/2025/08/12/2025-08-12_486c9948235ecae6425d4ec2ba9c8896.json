Through the letter, he called for ensuring prompt facilitation for the overseas Pakistani community.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Mr Atta said that during his recent tours to the United Kingdom (UK), France and Belgium on the invitation of various international legal bodies, he come across many people of Pakistani origin who shared with him difficulties they faced at the hands of officials, either working at the Pakistani missions or deputed at airports, such as members of the Customs Department etc. Copies of the letter have also been dispatched to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for his consideration.\n\nMr Atta stated that he had the opportunity to closely interact with overseas Pakistanis and personally observed the challenges they were facing.\n\n“I felt extreme pain to point out the problems faced by them not only abroad but at our airports as well,” he said, adding it was a common complaint among overseas Pakistanis that staff at embassies and high commissions were uncooperative and pay little heed to their concerns—despite the fact that the salaries of these officials come from the remittances sent by Pakistani diaspora.\n\nCiting examples, the SCBA president expressed regret that overseas Pakistanis were very disappointed with the behavior of Customs officials who often mistreated them when they returned home to spend time with their families. He added that many were discouraged at border control offices at airports by unnecessary demands such as producing visa verification at the time of international departure.\n\nNeedless to mention that Pakistani citizens residing abroad are a valuable national asset and a significant source of foreign exchange for the country, the letter said. It lamented that overseas Pakistanis often face considerable difficulties due to inadequate and delayed responses from Pakistani diplomatic missions when addressing their day-to-day queries and concerns.\n\nThe letter made a number of suggestions to ameliorate the sufferings such as the issuance of clear instructions to all Pakistani diplomatic missions to ensure prompt and effective facilitation of overseas community.\n\nIt also suggested the establishment of a 24/7 national helpline exclusively for overseas Pakistanis to provide guidance and resolve issues in a timely manner.\n\nMr Atta also called for additional measures to streamline and improve services for Pakistani citizens abroad and at national and international airports. He urged strict action against ‘delinquent’ officers of Customs, immigration and Airport Security Force (ASF) for abuse of authority and misconduct at airports.\n\nHe further suggested that a complaint cell be introduced in the Foreign Office, along with a mechanism for the expeditious redressal of grievances.\n\n“Such steps will not only strengthen the trust and confidence of the overseas Pakistani diaspora but will also further encourage their contribution to the national economy,” Mr Atta concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
