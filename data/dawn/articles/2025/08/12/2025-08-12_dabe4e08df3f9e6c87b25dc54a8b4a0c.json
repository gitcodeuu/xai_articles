  "content": "LAHORE: The Provincial Disas­ter Management Authority (PDMA) has issued a critical flood alert in the Sutlej, Ravi, Chenab, Jhelum and its adjoining tributaries, as Punjab is likely to brave the seventh spell of monsoon rains starting on Wednesday (tomorrow).\n\nThe authority also mentioned the possibility of a low-level flood in the Sutlej River at Ganda Singh Wala with the expected release of water by India in next three days. The flow of water in the Sutlej River may increase due to the release of water from the upper reservoirs. There has been an unusual increase in the water level in Indian dams during the last week.\n\nPDMA Punjab has issued an alert to the commissioners of Lahore, Sahiwal, Bahawalpur, Multan and Dera Ghazi Khan. An alert has also been issued to the deputy commissioners of Kasur, Okara, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, Vehari, Lodhran, Bahawalpur, Multan, Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and Rahim Yar Khan.\n\nPDMA issues alerts for Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur and D.G. Khan; low-level flood expected in Sutlej at Ganda Singh Wala\n\nThe warning follows scattered rainfall across Punjab, with Gujranwala’s Sheranwala Bagh recording 42mm rainfall — the highest in 24 hours — while Rawalpindi and Chakwal receiving 19mm and 16mm of rainfall, respectively.\n\nThe PDMA also warned that the renewed wave of showers may trigger urban flooding in some cities and hill torrents in southern regions.\n\nWith Tarbela Dam at 96pc capacity and Mangla at 64pc, Punjab remains on high alert for the incoming weather system that could test the flood management infrastructure and the province’s response mechanism amid cross-border water releases during the seventh and potentially most dangerous spell of this rainy season.\n\nAccording to PDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, Bhakra Dam on the Sutlej River has been filled up to 61pc. Water storage in Pong Dam is around 76pc while the Thein Dam is filled up to 64pc.\n\nBesides Punjab PDMA, Indus River System Authority and the provincial irrigation department are monitoring the rivers situation round the clock.\n\nThe fresh alert has been issued to the local government, agriculture department, irrigation department, health department, forest department, livestock and transport department as well.\n\nMr Kathia issued instructions to the relevant departments to be vigilant and staff in emergency control rooms should remain alert 24 hours a day. All necessary arrangements must be completed in advance, he said, adding that disaster response teams of Rescue 1122 must be on their toes with regular updates to the public regarding the situation.\n\nHe advised people to follow precautions and cooperate with the administration in case of emergency evacuation. He warned people to stay away from rivers, canals, streams and ponds.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
