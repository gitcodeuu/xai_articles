I think I managed quite well,” Chinese state media quoted Rancan as saying.\n\nDebertolis was listed as “Did Not Finish” in official results, along with 11 other athletes.\n\nHe was ranked 137th in the men’s Orienteering World Rankings and had been competing since 2014, according to the IOF website.\n\nHe participated in several World Championships and World Cups as part of the Italian team.\n\nAlongside his training, Debertolis was studying for a PhD at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, where he lived.\n\nThis is the 12th edition of the World Games and it runs until August 17, with approximately 4,000 athletes competing in 253 events.\n\nThe men’s middle-distance orienteering was the first medal event of the Chengdu Games.\n\nWorld Games organisers and the IOF were “struck by this tragedy and extend their heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of the athlete and the whole orienteering community”, the joint statement read.\n\n“Our thoughts are with those touched by this event.” Organisers will “continue to support the family of Mattia Debertolis and the orienteering community in every possible way”, it added.",
