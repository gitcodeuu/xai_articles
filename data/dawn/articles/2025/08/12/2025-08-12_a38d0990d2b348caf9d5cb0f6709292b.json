On Monday, Amin telephoned him, claiming that Erum had suffered a heart attack and died.\n\nThe complainant said he rushed to the house, took the body home. During burial, they noticed multiple injury marks on the body of Erum while her hands and feet were swollen. Suspecting foul play, he alleged that Maqbool, his brother Kamran, Maqbool’s wife Shumaila, and two unidentified accomplices had tortured Erum to death. He claimed that his minor daughter had not died of a heart attack.\n\nThe police registered a case against the five suspects.\n\nSSP Operations Rizwan Tariq said the investigation was underway and the suspects would face the full force of the law if found guilty.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
