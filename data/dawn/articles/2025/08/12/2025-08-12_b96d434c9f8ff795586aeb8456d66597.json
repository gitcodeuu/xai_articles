It contributes directly to our national health goals, economic development, and to the empowerment of women and girls,” he said.\n\n“The latest National Nutrition Survey shows that only 48 per cent of children in Pakistan are exclusively breastfed in the first six months.\n\nThis falls short of the global target of at least 60 per cent by 2030. Although early initiation and continued breastfeeding have seen improvements, more work is needed to close the gap and reach every child and mother with the support they need,“ Mr Kamal said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
