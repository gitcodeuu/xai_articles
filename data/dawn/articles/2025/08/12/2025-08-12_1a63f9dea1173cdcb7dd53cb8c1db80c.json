The Games has to be sustainable beyond 2030 and must also align with the UN sustainable development goals.\n\n“It must inspire the youth of the Commonwealth community while showcasing our diverse culture.”\n\nIndia hosted the 2010 Commonwealth Games in New Delhi, but the event was blighted by allegations of corruption and mismanagement.\n\nThe country is determined to make a better impression in 2030 to bolster its bid to host the Olympic Games six years later.\n\n“We’ve not hosted (since 2010) a major sports event with so many countries across all six regions,” Singh said.\n\n“So it will be a right step in that direction for our final dream of 2036.”\n\nCanada and Nigeria are also in the fray to host the 2030 edition of the Games, featuring athletes from 70-odd Commonwealth nations and territories.",
