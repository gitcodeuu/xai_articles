The injured were immediately taken to a hospital for treatment.\n\n“The railway is currently passing through very serious operational challenges, as the number of derailments and accidents is rising, badly damaging the locomotives, coaches and other rolling stock, track and interlocking/signaling system, etc,” an official told Dawn on Monday on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“The accidents are also leaving passengers and crew members injured, besides creating fear among those opting to travel by trains,” the official added, deploring that the authorities are not taking appropriate steps to deal with the situation that is worsening fast.\n\nAs per officials, after the derailment at Raiwind station, many locals rushed to the spot, while a large number of passengers also got off the train. A relief train was immediately dispatched to the accident site from the Lahore railway station in a bid to pull back the engine and passenger coach from the sand-hump, they added.\n\nFollowing the relief train, a new locomotive, along with a passenger coach, was also dispatched to the site to complete the train’s composition and dispatch it for the final destination—Multan. However, various passengers, particularly those travelling in the derailed coach, left the train and departed for their respective destinations by road.\n\nAccording to the initial investigation, the locomotive’s driver exceeded speed limit and failed to apply brakes on time, As a result the train entered the dead-end line.\n\nThe report says the derailment was caused by overshooting/over-speeding, stating that the train had a total 11 coaches, having a 450-tonne load hauled by the diesel locomotive No 6324. It says the train departed from Jia Bagga station at 1:08am and its reception was arranged at Raiwind station on down main line and reception signals were lowered properly. At 1:16am, the train engine, along with the coach No 12050, entered the sand-hump and derailed.\n\n“After visiting the site of the accident and collecting evidence, [it transpired] the train engine and the coach entered the sand-hump, derailing both by all wheels. We concluded that the driver of the train failed to control and stop the train at line No-4 (down) well on time and entered the sand-hump.”\n\nThe report, signed by five officials, concludes.\n\nThe Peshawar-bound Awam Express train’s two coaches suffered derailment near Khanpur station, suspending rail traffic on the main line-1 on Sunday.\n\nThe Awam Express derailment reportedly occurred due to negligence of the pointsman, who allegedly failed to correctly operate the interlocking system (Kanta). Same day, Jaffar Express’ five coaches were derailed in Balochistan due to an ID blast on the track carried out by terrorists. On Aug 2, an economy-class coach of the Business Express train derailed in the yard of Karachi Cantt Railway Station.\n\nMoreover, on Aug 1, almost all coaches of the Rawalpindi-bound Islamabad Express derailed between Kala Shah Kaku and Muridke, leaving several passengers injured, besides causing massive damage to the rolling stock and a large portion of the track.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
