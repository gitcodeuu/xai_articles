It was started in 2021 and the end time was June 2025, but due to poor performance, it couldn’t achieve the objectives therefore, WB decided to close it, they added.\n\nHowever, on the government’s assurance, WB granted extension to the project till December, 2026 but with a cut on the total amount thereby reducing it to $62 million for health.\n\nOne of the conditions for extension of the project was to change the previous management, which the government did in February this year. “Now, WB is satisfied with current administration,” they said.\n\nKP-HICP director Dr Mohammad Bilal told Dawn that he had provided all details to ACE without elaborating further.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
