The BLA itself was proscribed in 2006, according to the National Counter-Terrorism Authority’s list of proscribed organisations.\n\n“BLA/Majeed Brigade is involved in multiple terrorist attacks in Pakistan, including the heinous Jaffer Express terrorist incident and the Khuzdar bus attack that resulted in the loss of precious lives,” the release said.\n\nAt least 26 hostages lost their lives in the Jaffar Express attack in March, for which the BLA claimed responsibility. In the Khuzdar bus attack, 10 people — including two students — lost their lives during a suicide attack on a school bus in May.\n\nThe group was also behind the 2024 attack near the Karachi airport, which killed three people, including two Chinese nationals, as well as the Gwadar Port Authority Complex attack, which claimed the lives of eight soldiers.\n\n“Pakistan remains a steadfast bulwark against terrorism. Our sacrifices have secured critical counter-terrorism successes, not only for the country, but for regional stability and global security.”\n\nIt added that the country remained unwavering in its resolve to protect its citizens and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. “Pakistan remains committed to cooperating with the international community to overcome this common challenge.”\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi welcomed the US decision and sincerely thanked US President Donald Trump and his administration.\n\n“This is a major diplomatic victory for Pakistan and another defeat for our eternal enemy,” Naqvi was quoted as saying in a post on X by his ministry.\n\n“This move by the US is an acknowledgement of Pakistan’s immense sacrifices in the war against terrorism,” adding that Pak-US cooperation against terrorism is welcome.\n\n“A path has been created for action on a global level against the BLA and Majeed Brigade.”\n\nPPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari also welcomed the US’s decision while speaking to reporters at an event in Hyderabad.\n\nHe said organisations such as the BLA and Majeed Brigade used violence to target innocent civilians, especially hard-working labourers who went to Balochistan for work.\n\n“When India and Pakistan fought a war, BLA and Majeed Brigade openly voiced support for Modi,” he said.\n\n“Now the US has endorsed this point, which is a huge success for Pakistan.”\n\nHe noted that although it helps when other countries declare these groups as terrorist organisations, “we must try to declare it as such through the UN so that international financing, especially that of Indian intelligence agencies and facilitators, is tackled”.\n\nThe Associated Press of Pakistan reported that security sources said that Field Marshal Asim Munir’s recent visit to the US had significantly contributed to the global recognition of Pakistan’s stance on regional security and had once again “exposed India’s involvement in state-sponsored terrorism”.\n\nAccording to the sources, “India’s covert support for terrorism has been brought to light through Field Marshal Munir’s successful military diplomacy.\n\n“The US designation of BLA and the Majeed Brigade as terrorist organisations is a direct outcome of the field marshal’s efforts.”\n\nThe sources emphasised that the US move to blacklist the BLA and Majeed Brigade as global terrorist organisations represented international validation of Pakistan’s position.\n\nSecurity sources concluded by warning that India’s terrorist designs posed a serious threat not only to regional stability but also to global peace.\n\nIslamabad had previously requested that the Majeed Brigade be listed as an international terrorist organisation. In 2019, the State Department labelled the BLA as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT), making it a crime for anyone in the US to assist the militants, but did not designate the Majeed Brigade at that time.\n\nFTO designations are made by the Secretary of State, following section 219 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), and “are an effective means of curtailing support for terrorist activities and pressuring groups to get out of the terrorism business”.\n\nSDGT designations, meanwhile, target individuals and groups under Executive Order 13224, even if they are not part of a formally recognised organisation.",
