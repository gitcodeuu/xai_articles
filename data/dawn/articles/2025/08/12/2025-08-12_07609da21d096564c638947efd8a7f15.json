  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary committee on Monday expressed concern over transfer of Pakistan Customs constables from Balochistan to Karachi, creating difficulties for some personnel who should preferably be posted within their own province rather than being posted outstations.\n\nSenator Sardar Muhammad Umer Gorgaij moved a privilege motion on June 21, 2025, regarding alleged misconduct of the chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue.\n\nHe informed the committee that a large number of FBR constables from Balochistan have been transferred to Karachi. He said he had raised the matter with several FBR senior officers, but his concern was not addressed.\n\nIn response to the concern of Senator Gorgaij, the chairman of FBR apprised the committee that many constables were found to be involved in smuggling activities, which was the reason behind their transfers to Karachi.\n\nHe further said there is a separate mechanism in place for transfers, whereby an application may be sent via email and, after a review, if the matter is found to be genuine, the transfer is reconsidered.\n\nAfter a detailed discussion, the chairman of the committee recommended that constables should be allowed to submit hand-written applications because many of them may not be sufficiently educated to use email.\n\nThe chairman of the committee directed the FBR to review the matter during the current week and submit a report to the committee.\n\nThe panel also discussed an incident in Karachi where Pakistan Customs officers, without prior notice, raided shops and behaved allegedly in an abusive manner and physically assaulted individuals.\n\nExpressing strong concern over the matter, the chairman of FBR said that if any officer is found involved in such misconduct, he would suspend them.\n\nThe chairman of the committee further directed the chairman of FBR to visit the location of the incident and meet the merchants concerned.\n\nThe Senate standing committee on rules of procedures and privileges held its meeting in the Parliament House. Senator Syed Waqar Mehdi chaired the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was attended by senators Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, Raja Nasir Abbas, Sardar Muhammad Umer Gorgaij, Saadia Abbasi, Dost Ali Jessar, Jan Muhammad and officials from the Ministry of Parliamentary a\\Affairs division.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
