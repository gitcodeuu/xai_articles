  "content": "ISLAMABAD: To strengthen the longstanding brotherly ties, Islamabad is set to deepen its relationship with Jakarta by naming roads and installing reciprocal monuments in each other’s capital cities.\n\nThis initiative aims to revive the sister city agreement signed between the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Jakarta in 1984.\n\nAccording to sources, the federal government has directed the CDA to fully implement this agreement and submit proposals on how the collaboration with Jakarta can be revitalised through meaningful and symbolic activities. These measures are expected to include naming roads in Islamabad and Jakarta after prominent personalities from each other’s countries, as well as erecting reciprocal monuments.\n\nA source familiar with the proposal said, “The federal government wants to carry out a series of coordinated activities with Jakarta’s administration, including symbolic gestures such as mutual road naming and monument installation.”\n\nThe CDA has been asked to prepare and share detailed plans in line with these directions.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that Islamabad already has several roads named after foreign dignitaries, while many countries have streets named after notable Pakistani leaders. For instance, Iran Avenue in Islamabad was inaugurated last year by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and then-President of Iran Ebrahim Raisi during his visit. In February this year, an interchange in the F-8 sector was named after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan during his state visit.\n\nOther prominent roads in Islamabad include Faisal Avenue, named after the late Saudi King Shah Faisal; Atatürk Avenue, honouring the Turkish nationalist leader Mustafa Kemal Ataturk; as well as roads named after Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, former Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and a Japan Road.\n\nSeveral parks in the capital, such as Argentina Park, Ankara Park, and Japanese Park, also reflect Islamabad’s tradition of commemorating friendly nations. The city’s main mosque, Faisal Mosque, named after King Faisal of Saudi Arabia, stands as a prominent symbol of Pakistan’s ties with the Muslim world. Designed by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay, the mosque’s foundation was laid in 1976 and completed in 1988 following King Faisal Abdul Aziz’s visit to Islamabad in 1966.\n\nAn official from the CDA confirmed, “Following the federal government’s directive, we are finalising proposals in light of the 1984 MoU signed with Jakarta. The plan will be submitted soon.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 12th, 2025",
