The truce on steeper levies had been due to expire on Tuesday.\n\nWhile the US and China slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products this year, bringing them to prohibitive triple-digit levels and snarling trade, both countries in May agreed to temporarily lower them.\n\nAs part of their May truce, fresh US tariffs targeting China were reduced to 30 percent and the corresponding level from China was cut to 10pc.\n\nThose rates will now hold until November — or whenever a deal is cut before then.\n\nAround the same time that Trump confirmed the new extension, Chinese state media Xinhua news agency published a joint statement from US-China talks in Stockholm saying it would also extend its side of the truce.\n\nChina will continue suspending its earlier tariff hike for 90 days starting August 12 while retaining a 10pc duty, the report said.\n\nIt would also “take or maintain necessary measures to suspend or remove non-tariff countermeasures against the US, as agreed in the Geneva joint declaration,” Xinhua reported.\n\nIn the executive order posted on Monday to its website, the White House reiterated its position that there are “large and persistent annual US goods trade deficits” and they “constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.”\n\nThe order acknowledged Washington’s ongoing discussions with Beijing “to address the lack of trade reciprocity in our economic relationship” and noted that China has continued to “take significant steps toward remedying” the US complaints.\n\n“Beijing will be happy to keep the US-China negotiation going, but it is unlikely to make concessions,” warned William Yang, an analyst at the International Crisis Group.\n\nHe believes China sees its leverage over rare earth exports as a strong one, and that Beijing will likely use it to pressure Washington.\n\nUS-China Business Council president Sean Stein said the current extension is “critical to give the two governments time to negotiate an agreement” providing much-needed certainty for companies to make plans.\n\nA trade deal, in turn, would “pave the way for a Trump-Xi summit this fall,” said Asia Society Policy Institute senior vice president Wendy Cutler.\n\nBut Cutler, herself a former US trade official, said: “This will be far from a walk in the park.”\n\nSince Trump took office, China’s tariffs have essentially boomeranged, from the initially modest 10pc hike in February, followed by repeated surges as Beijing and Washington clashed, until it hit a high of 145pc in April.\n\nNow the tariff has been pulled back to 30pc, a negotiated truce rate.\n\nEven as both countries reached a pact to cool tensions after high level talks in Geneva in May, the de-escalation has been shaky.\n\nKey economic officials convened in London in June as disagreements emerged and US officials accused their counterparts of violating the pact.\n\nPolicymakers met again in Stockholm last month.\n\nTrump said in a social media post on Sunday that he hoped China will “quickly quadruple its soybean orders,” adding that this would be a way to balance trade with the US.\n\nChina’s exports reached record highs in 2024, and Beijing reported that their exports exceeded expectations in June, climbing 5.8pc year-on-year, as the economic superpower works to sustain growth amid Trump’s trade war.\n\nSeparately, since returning to the presidency in January, Trump has slapped a 10pc “reciprocal” tariff on almost all trading partners, aimed at addressing trade practices Washington deemed unfair.\n\nThis surged to varying steeper levels last Thursday for dozens of economies. Major partners like the European Union, Japan and South Korea now see a 15pc US duty on many products, while the level went as high as 41pc for Syria.\n\nThe “reciprocal” tariffs exclude sectors that have been targeted individually, such as steel and aluminum, and those that are being investigated like pharmaceuticals and semiconductors.\n\nThey are also expected to exclude gold, although a clarification by US customs authorities made public last week caused concern that certain gold bars might still be targeted.\n\nTrump said on Monday that gold imports will not face additional tariffs, without providing further details.\n\nThe president has taken separate aim at individual countries such as Brazil over the trial of former president Jair Bolsonaro, who is accused of planning a coup, and India over its purchase of Russian oil.\n\nCanada and Mexico come under a different tariff regime.",
