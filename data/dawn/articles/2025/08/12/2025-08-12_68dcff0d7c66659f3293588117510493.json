The needs of children are vast, and their potential is even greater.\n\n“I look forward to building on strong foundations and working in close partnership with the government, UN and other development partners, civil society, the public and private sectors, and passionate child rights advocates. Together, we have a powerful opportunity to create positive, lasting change so that every child can truly thrive.”\n\nThe Unicef representative highlighted that nearly half of Pakistan’s population was under 18 and two-thirds were below age 30, holding “extraordinary promise”.\n\n“This young population can be a catalyst for transformation. By investing in education, early childhood and neonatal care, nutrition, safe water, child protection, and increasing climate resilience, we can unlock the talent and creativity of children and young people to drive progress and prosperity,” she said.\n\n“I look forward to leading Unicef’s mission and being a champion for every child.”\n\nThe press release also added that Ironside was a Canadian national with over 20 years of experience in international development, humanitarian action and child rights advocacy in diverse roles with Unicef.\n\nShe served as the deputy director of data, planning, analytics and monitoring at Unicef Headquarters in New York, deputy representative in Nigeria, chief of field operations in Iraq, chief of the Gaza Strip Field Office, senior global advisor on child protection in emergencies, child protection specialist in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, with additional deployments in Yemen, the Philippines and Pakistan.\n\nUnicef’s ongoing initiatives in Pakistan currently benefit nearly six million children. These programmes aimed to protect children’s health, support their growth, enhance their skills, and empower them to realise their full potential, thereby contributing positively to Pakistan’s socio-economic development.\n\nIn May, the agency pledged support and protection for Pakistan’s children against the climate crisis and its impacts on their economic and social lives.",
