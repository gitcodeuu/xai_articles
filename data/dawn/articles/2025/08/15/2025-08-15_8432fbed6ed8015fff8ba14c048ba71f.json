All green leaf threshing units regularly pay due taxes. It is impossible to continue with business under this discouraging environment for industrialists,” said Fazal Rahim Jadoon.\n\nHe said tobacco exports totalled $167 million this year, making significant contributions to the country’s economic development.\n\nKILLED: A man was killed and two critically injured in a firing incident in Razaar tehsil soon after midnight on Thursday, said police.\n\nThe incident took place in Ghulama village, leaving Jahanzeb, 33, Awais Khan, 30, Ali Zaman, 28, all residents of Parmuli village, seriously injured.\n\nThe Rescue 1122 medical team provided first aid to the injured and shifted them to the tehsil headquarters hospital.
