  "content": "KARACHI: Around 10 per cent of people with diabetes in Pakistan suffer from diabetic foot, leaving more than 3.4 million at risk of severe ulcers or amputations, experts warned on Thursday at the launch of a multidisciplinary facility at the Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology (BIDE).\n\nHighlighting the country’s struggle with the highest diabetes prevalence rate in the world, the experts said diabetes was silently fuelling heart attacks, strokes, kidney failure, blindness and long-term disability, making it one of Pakistan’s deadliest and costliest health challenges.\n\nBIDE Director Prof Zahid Miyan said diabetes was the leading cause of kidney failure and amputation globally, and one of the main triggers of stroke.\n\n“These are not just statistics — these are lives being lost or permanently changed,” he stressed, warning that without urgent interventions, the human and economic toll would continue to rise.\n\nThe facility features 15 purpose-built clinics and more than 30 specialist consultants to provide integrated treatment for diabetes and its complications under one roof.\n\nThe services include a cardiac clinic, neurology and stroke clinic, nephrology clinic and eye clinic, ensuring that patients receive timely, coordinated and comprehensive care.\n\nBIDE Deputy Director Dr Saif ul Haq said the centre’s multidisciplinary approach was designed to address Pakistan’s diabetes burden in its entirety — from prevention and early detection to the treatment of complex complications — with the goal of improving patient outcomes and quality of life.\n\nTrustee of the Baqai Foundation, Fizza Baqai, who performed the ribbon-cutting, described the hospital as a “promise of hope, healing, and better lives”.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by senior executives from some of the country’s largest pharmaceutical companies — including Atco Pharma, Pharmevo, Novo Nordisk Pakistan, Hoest Pakistan, Maxtech, Martin Dow, Getz, Searle Laboratories, Highnoon Pharma and Horizon — as well as senior health and police officials.\n\nPharmevo and Premier Group Chief Executive Officer Haroon Qasim lauded BIDE’s services as a major step towards making quality, accessible healthcare a reality in Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
