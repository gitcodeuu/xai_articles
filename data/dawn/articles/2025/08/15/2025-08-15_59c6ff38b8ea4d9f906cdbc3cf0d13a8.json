  "content": "DAR SALAAM: Rescue operations were ongoing at a Tanzanian mine which collapsed three days ago, burying at least 25 people, the country’s President Samia Suluhu Hassan said on Thursday.\n\nThe accident on Monday occurred as maintenance was being conducted at the Nyandolwa gold mine in northwestern Shin­yanga Region, roughly 200 kilometres (124 miles) north of the capital, Dodoma.\n\nIn a statement posted on X, Hassan said that “25 of our compatriots working at the mine were buried under debris”. She expressed her “great sadness” over the accident, and said that security agencies would assist fire and rescue forces to “expedite the ongoing rescue operation”.\n\nShinyanga Regional Commissioner Mboni Mhita urged for patience. “Nobody expected this accident to happen, let’s remain calm and continue supporting rescue efforts,” she said at the scene. “The buried people were conducting maintenance in the shafts,” she said.\n\nTanzania is the continent’s fourth-largest gold producer, and mining accidents are not uncommon, with miners often lacking adequate safety equipment.\n\nIn January last year, 22 miners died in a landslide at another gold mine in the north of the country, after it was hit by torrential rain.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
