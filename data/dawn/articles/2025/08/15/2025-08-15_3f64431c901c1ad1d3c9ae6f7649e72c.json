  "content": "LOWER DIR: The Jamaat-i-Islami Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (North) emir, Inayatullah Khan, has demanded of the federal government to immediately stop the ongoing military operation in Bajaur, and called for comprehensive talks with Afghanistan, development packages for the merged tribal districts under the 25th Constitutional Amendment, and a national consensus to ensure durable peace.\n\nSpeaking at an urgently called press conference at the JI district headquarters here the other day, Jamia Ahyaul Uloom, Balambat, he said that over 100,000 people, including a large number of women and children had so far been displaced due to the operation, while two girls were killed after a mortar shell hit a house.\n\nThe JI district chief and former MNA Maulana Asadullah, Dir Qaumi Jirga head and former MNA Sahibzada Mohammad Yaqub Khan, former MPA Haji Saeed Gul, provincial secretary information Engr Hafiz Yaqubur Rehman, district general secretary Shoaib Ahmad and spokesman Malik Sher Bahadur Khan were also present.\n\nMr Inayatullah said a targeted operation aimed solely against militants was acceptable, but using it as a cover to harm civilians and render them homeless was “unacceptable under any circumstances.” He accused the PTI-led provincial government of “double-speak” — supporting the operation behind the closed doors while opposing it publicly.\n\nThe provincial government’s announcement of Rs50,000 compensations per displaced family, he said, was akin to “rubbing salt into their wounds”.\n\nHe stressed that military action was not a sustainable solution and urged resolution to tribal grievances through national dialogue.“\n\nHe called for improved relations with Afghanistan for a lasting solution, effective enforcement of state writ in border areas, and a ban on militants movement across the frontier.\n\nMr Inayatullah demanded that all administrative powers be handed over to the civil administration, the Counter-Terrorism Department be equipped with modern technology, police requirements be met on a priority basis, and funds be released immediately.\n\nHe said the JI’s welfare wing, Al-Khidmat Foundation, had so far provided relief packages to thousands of affected families and it would continue the assistance drive.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
