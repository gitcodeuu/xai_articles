He added that such establishments would be classified into aesthetic medical and surgical clinics and beauty salons and classification would be based on the nature of services provided by a particular establishment.\n\n“Aesthetic clinics, which provide services falling under the definition of healthcare establishment, shall be registered by KP-HCC, whereas beauty salons that provide cosmetic and non-medical services shall be registered by labour department under the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Shops and Establishment, Act, 2015,” he said.\n\nHCC chief says such outlets will be regulated according to law\n\nSection 25 of the said Act provides for registration of shops and establishments for a fee, issuing a registration certificate and maintaining a register.\n\nThis way, a database shall be available at the provincial level, which can be used by labour department; industries, commerce and technical education department; and KP-HCC for regulation of quality, human resource and prices.\n\nWhereas establishments providing services of both aesthetic clinic and beauty salon shall be registered with KP-HCC and labour department for the respective services, and shall be regulated accordingly.\n\nTo ensure quality control, KP-HCC will assess the operations of aesthetic clinics through quality of service standards as per rules and regulations of the commission. It will monitor beauty salons periodically to ensure that only non-medical cosmetic services are provided, using the monitoring tools as per law.\n\nThese will be regulated under Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Shops and Establishment Act, 2015, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Consumer Protection Act, 1997, like any other service industry.\n\nThe two Acts are implemented by labour department; and industries, commerce and technical education department, government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nRegarding the staff credentials control, there are relevant regulatory and licensing bodies in Pakistan for credentials of human resource of various service industries.\n\nThe staff credentials shall be regulated for aesthetic clinics through education, training and experience of health care service providers as determined by the respective council. In the case of aesthetic clinics, the required staff is licensed by Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (PMDC).\n\nIn this respect, PMDC has issued ‘credentialing pathways of aesthetic medical practice’ in 2022 in which the credentials of aesthetic physicians and surgeons have been determined. The qualifications of those running beauty salons are diploma in beautician and certificates issued by Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority (Tevta) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nAbout price control for aesthetic clinics, HCC has submitted amendments to the Act that include authority to regulate prices of healthcare services. Once approved, the prices of aesthetic centres will be regulated by the commission.\n\nFor beauty salon, the district authorities have a mechanism for price fixation and control of commodities and services. The prices shall be regulated by price control committees, working under district administration like any other services sector.\n\nMr Nadeem said that the commission carried out 9,100 inspections of medical clinics, diagnostic centres during the last one year and 1,491 were sealed, 2,391 were registered while 2,821 healthcare establishments were issued notices to rectify deficiencies and enhance service standards.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
