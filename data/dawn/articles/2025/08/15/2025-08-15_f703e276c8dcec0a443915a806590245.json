  "content": "WASHINGTON: In a message on Pakistan’s Independence Day, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio reiterated Washington’s offer to help Pakistan develop its hydrocarbon and mineral reserves.\n\n“The United States deeply appreciates Pakistan’s engagement on counterterrorism and trade. We look forward to exploring new areas of economic cooperation, including critical minerals and hydrocarbons, and fostering dynamic business partnerships which will promote a prosperous future for Americans and Pakistanis,” Rubio said.\n\nThe celebrations in Washington began with a flag-hoisting ceremony at the Pakistan Embassy, where Ambassador Rizwan Shaikh told guests that the two nations have been close allies since Pakistan’s independence in 1947, and that this friendship has endured “ups and downs” over the decades.\n\nHis remarks echoed President Donald Trump’s repeated pledge to assist Pakistan in tapping what he calls its “massive oil deposits.”\n\nAbout a dozen members of Congress also sent messages marking Pakistan’s 79th Independence Day.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
