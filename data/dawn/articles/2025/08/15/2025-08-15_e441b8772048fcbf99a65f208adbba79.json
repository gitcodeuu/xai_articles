  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Com­merce Minister Jam Kamal has constituted a dedicated committee to address critical challenges facing the auto sector, following a high-level meeting with industry representatives.\n\nAccording to an official statement, the committee will comprise officials from the Ministry of Commerce, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), and the Ministry of Industries and Production.\n\nThe minister stressed the importance of protecting the domestic auto industry from the influx of used vehicle imports, which, he noted, weakens local manufacturing. He said the government is formulating a comprehensive strategy to support sectoral growth and expand auto exports.\n\n“We have successfully begun exporting tractors and motorcycles — now it’s time to add cars to the list,” Mr Kamal said, indicating a new phase of industrial development. He also invited auto manufacturers to contribute to the upcoming national industrial policy actively.\n\nHighlighting emerging trends, the minister observed that healthy competition in Pakistan’s auto market could foster innovation and expand consumer choice. He announced that tariffs on the auto sector would be gradually reduced over the next five years to improve industry competitiveness.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
