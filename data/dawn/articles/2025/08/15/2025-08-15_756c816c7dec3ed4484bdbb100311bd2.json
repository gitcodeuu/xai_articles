Their presentation of various dance styles from across Pakis­tan was undeniably enthusiastic, if not always refined, and led to many Pakistanis in the audience breaking out into vociferous ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ chants.\n\nArguably, the most compelling aspect of the dance performances was a sequence titled ‘Taxila Odyssey’, which saw the performers shed light upon the ancient city and the Buddhist heritage that is baked into the land of Pakistan and deserves to be celebrated as such.\n\nThe dances, some of which had been presented to raucous applause from Expo visitors a day earlier at one of the pop-up stages, clearly communicated something intangibly valuable to the viewers in a way that only dance can.\n\nJapanese designer Yuna Hattori, the brain behind the brand KANON, put on a cross-cultural fashion show that demonstrated her “sus­tainable designs that fused reclaimed Japa­nese kimono fabrics with tra­d­iti­onal Pakistani textiles.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
