And I don’t want to use the word ‘divvy’ things up. But you know, to a certain extent, it’s not a bad term,” Trump said.\n\nZelensky has refused any territorial concessions to Russia, which has ramped up attacks and made sharp gains on the battlefield just ahead of the summit.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said any future deal needed to ensure Ukraine’s security. “To achieve peace, I think we all recognise that there’ll have to be some conversation about security guarantees,” Rubio told reporters in Washington, adding that he was “hopeful” about the summit.\n\nTrump has previously ruled out letting Ukraine join Nato and backed Russia’s stance that Kyiv’s aspirations to enter the transatlantic alliance triggered the war.\n\nUkraine and most of its European allies reject Putin’s narrative and point to his remarks denying the historical legitimacy of Ukraine.\n\nPutin welcomes US efforts\n\nMeanwhile, Putin on Thursday welcomed US efforts to end the conflict and said that talks could also help yield an agreement on nuclear arms control.\n\n“The US administration… is making quite energetic and sincere efforts to end the fighting,” Putin told a meeting of top officials in Moscow.\n\nThe talks are set to begin at 11:30am (1930 GMT) on Friday at the Elmendorf Air Force Base, a major US military installation in Alaska that has been crucial in monitoring Russia.\n\n“This conversation will take place in a one-on-one format, naturally with the participation of interpreters,” Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow.\n\nHe said that delegations would continue discussions over a working lunch and that Putin and Trump would hold a joint news conference.\n\nThe White House has not confirmed any plans for a joint press appearance.\n\nTrump faced heated criticism over his joint news conference after his 2018 summit with Putin in Helsinki where he sided with Russia over US intelligence in accepting Putin’s denials of interfering in the 2016 US election to help Trump.\n\nEuropean support for Zelensky\n\nZelensky, who will not join Friday’s summit in Alaska, on Thursday met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, after talks a day earlier in Berlin.\n\nStarmer greeted the Ukrainian leader with a warm hug and handshake on the steps of his Downing Street residence and later voiced solidarity.\n\nEuropean leaders expressed relief after a call with Trump on Wednesday, saying he appeared focused on a ceasefire rather than concessions by Ukraine.\n\nA day before the summit, Ukraine fired dozens of drones at Russia, wounding several people and sparking fires at an oil refinery in the southern city of Volgograd.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
