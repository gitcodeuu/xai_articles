  "content": "LAHORE: The South Asian Free Media Association (Safma) and over a dozen civil society organisations and Left parties organised a seminar to make peace new normal, rather than war, which could be provoked by a handful of terrorists and agent provocateurs.\n\nHundreds of peace activists expressed their opposition to the war-like situation, called for a permanent ceasefire and favoured resumption of a comprehensive dialogue.\n\nThe speakers called on the governments of India and Pakistan to show maximum restraint and take confidence-building measures to normalise the situation. They warned against the possibilities of resumption of much more dangerous conflict in a nuclear neighbourhood.\n\nA resolution was passed by the peace activists calling upon the two governments to restore full-fledged diplomatic relations, opening of borders, resumption of people-to-people contacts, revival of trade and engaging in a result-oriented dialogue.\n\nThe resolution cautioned against the dangers of a nuclear conflict and urged both India and Pakistan to enter into a nuclear stabilisation agreement. The participants proposed to turn the Wagah/Attari border into a peace park. They emphasised strengthening Asia-Pacific unity, SCO, and BRICS.\n\nThe speakers called to revive SAARC and move towards creating South Asia Economic Union.\n\nThose who addressed the seminar included Imtiaz Alam, Dr Waseem of LUMS, Farooq Tariq of Haqooq-i-Khalq Party, Tehseen, Sabina Malik and others.\n\nLater, around 200 peace activists went to the Wagah border in a caravan. They lit candles on the border post and raised slogans against ‘hot and cold wars’ and for peace in the subcontinent. They waved national flags and paid tributes to the martyrs of freedom struggle. It was a memorable candle-lit vigil that continued till 1am.\n\nUnfortunately, Indian authorities didn’t permit Indian peace activists to enter Attari post, and they lit candles in front of Jallianwala Bagh.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
