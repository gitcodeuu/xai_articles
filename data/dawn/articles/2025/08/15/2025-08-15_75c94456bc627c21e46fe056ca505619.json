  "content": "KARACHI: Speakers at a seminar said that the recent ban on operations of rickshaws on certain roads in the metropolis was a blow to the livelihoods of thousands of citizens as it was inflicting financial losses on operators, along with making daily travel even harder for the general public.\n\nThe Sindh government has imposed a ban on the operation of motor cab rickshaws on major roads across the city as part of efforts to improve the traffic system and reduce law violations, particularly after the metropolis saw a surge in fatal traffic accidents.\n\nThe seminar titled “Lack of Public Transport in the City: The Travel Difficulties of Citizens” was held on Wednesday at the Urban Resource Centre (URC), where representatives of various rickshaw associations and URC chairperson Arif Hasan shared their thoughts.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr Hasan said that any transport-related policies should place the highest priority on providing convenience to the people.\n\nSpeakers at seminar decry decision to ban affordable transport amid existing bus shortage\n\nHowever, he lamented that this was not the case in Karachi. “The government is not interested in addressing these matters, as keeping these problems unresolved benefits the officials financially.”\n\nHe said that the ban on motor cab rickshaws in the city was not beneficial and if a law was being cited as the reason for it, that was merely an excuse because the law could be amended to provide ease to the people.\n\nSyed Adnan Shah of a rickshaw association also criticised the ban on auto cabs in the city and called it a failure of government policy.\n\nHe said that when these rickshaws first entered the market, authorities did nothing to stop them and set no clear regulations or technical standards. “Poor people paid heavy taxes to purchase these rickshaws, built their livelihoods around them and provided affordable transport to the public,” he said.\n\nMr Shah argued that the government suddenly decided that the vehicles violated regulations and failed to meet required specifications.\n\n“The real negligence lies with the government and relevant departments for not regularising the matter from the start,” he said, adding that the sudden policy change was inflicting financial losses on rickshaw owners and increasing difficulties for commuters.\n\nWhile admitting that rickshaw associations also bore some responsibility, he stressed that banning rickshaws was unfair and urged the government to reverse the decision.\n\nPresident of All Sindh Rickshaw Association Imran Zaidi also spoke on the occasion. He said that motor cab rickshaws had long been an easy source of income for the poor and a cheap transport facility for citizens.\n\n“Our transport department has no proper policy. Their policy is a free policy,” he said, adding that the ban had disrupted the entire industry and affected manufacturers, workers, buyers, commuters as well as mechanics. Mr Zaidi further claimed that the real reason behind the ban was not road congestion or other traffic issues, as motor cab rickshaws had been operating in Karachi for the past 15 years.\n\nHe said that the government aimed to introduce buses through a public-private partnership in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank.\n\nHe added that if the government wanted to bring buses, it could do so but rickshaws should not be banned in the meantime. “Once the required number of buses is brought and purchased, the issue of rickshaws can be fixed and adjusted,” he added.\n\nThe association also noted that it had requested the government to issue a standard operating procedure to regulate the sector but no such guidelines were provided.\n\nViolations of traffic laws by rickshaw drivers and their overall behaviour was also criticised.\n\nStudents and other citizens who attended the event also shared their concerns. They shared that commuting by Qingqis or motor cab rickshaws had previously been both affordable and convenient but was no longer so due to the restrictions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
