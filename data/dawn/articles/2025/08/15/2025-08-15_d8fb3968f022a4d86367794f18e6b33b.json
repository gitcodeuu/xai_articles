It staged the 2023 Cricket World Cup final.\n\nIndia last year submitted a formal letter of intent to the International Olympic Committee to host the 2036 Games.\n\nIndia has staged World Cups for cricket and the Asian Games twice, and will co-host the Women’s World Cup cricket in September.\n\nNigeria and at least two other nations have reportedly expressed interest in hosting the Commonwealth Games, which struggled to find a replacement host for 2026 after the Australian state of Victoria withdrew citing costs. Glasgow stepped in and will stage a slimmed-down version.\n\nFollowing IOA approval, India has until the end of August to submit a formal bid. The decision will be made in November in Glasgow.\n\nIndia said that if it wins the bid, the Commonwealth Games would be a “full-fledged” event.\n\n“We will have all the sports we are good at and have a chance of winning maximum medals,” said IOA executive council member Rohit Rajpal, according to the Times of India newspaper.\n\nThat would include tag-type sports such as kabaddi and kho kho, which India is pushing to be included in the Olympics.\n\nDespite its 1.4 billion people India’s record at the Olympics is poor for a country of its size, winning only 10 gold medals in its history.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
