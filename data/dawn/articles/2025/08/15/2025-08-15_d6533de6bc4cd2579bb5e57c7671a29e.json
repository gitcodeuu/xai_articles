In the same area, a raging flood in Machhiara Nullah obliterated a major bridge.\n\nIn Sudhnoti district, Misbah Ashfaq, 26, died after being swept away by a stream. Deputy Commissioner Mumtaz Kazmi said 34 houses in his district were partially or completely damaged.\n\nIn Bagh district, Akhtar Begum, 57, was killed when her home collapsed.\n\nThe northeastern Neelum Valley also faced major disruptions, where tourists were shifted to safety.\n\nMore than 600 tourists camping at the Ratti Gali lake base were advised to remain in place after the link road was damaged. The floods also washed away two connecting bridges over Lawat Nullah, and the swollen Jagran Nullah tore away a bridge in Kundal Shahi. A scenic riverside restaurant and at least three houses in the area were also swept away.\n\nIn the Jhelum Valley, a cloudburst over Palhot unleashed a flash flood that damaged part of the road and left dozens of vehicles stranded. In Nardajiyan village, a raging torrent swept away six shops.\n\nWith the Neelum River rising rapidly, authorities issued a flood warning and plan to relocate vulnerable riverside families.\n\nThe Muzaffarabad–Mansehra highway remains blocked at Lohar Gali due to a landslide.\n\nDamages in GB\n\nIn Gilgit-Baltistan, flash floods killed at least eight people and with two still missing in the Ghizer district, devastating villages in the Khalti, Ishkoman and Yasin areas.\n\n“Daen Area of Ishkoman Tehsil, Khalti of Gupis Tehsil and Thoi, Barkulti and Taus areas of Yasin Tehsil have received short but heavy rains, which devastated many villages and infrastructure,” said provincial spokesperson Faizullah Faraq.\n\nIn the Khalti valley, a house with at least seven people inside was struck by heavy debris, Additional Deputy Commissioner Mir Afzal said.

The rising waters prompted a rescue in Shakargarh, where four men were stranded in the surging Nullah Bain.\n\nThe Met Office and PDMA predicted scattered to very heavy rainfall across upper Punjab from August 18-21, with Rawalpindi, Lahore, Sialkot and Narowal.\n\nAlerts were issued for the River Jhelum at Mangla Dam, the Indus River at Chashma, and the Chenab River at Marala Barrage.
