The participants opposed any military operation and forced displacement in the region.\n\nThey wondered if authorities would promise in writing that the military operation would eradicate terrorism from the region forever and that there would be no such action in the future.\n\nMonday’s gathering was attended by adviser to the chief minister Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif, Senator Noorul Haq Qadri, the chief secretary, police chief, the relevant commissioners, deputy commissioners and senior police officials, according to an official statement from the Chief Minister’s Secretariat.\n\nThe participants thoroughly discussed the law and order situation in Bajaur and Mohmand tribal districts and made several recommendations.\n\nThe participants expressed their commitment to peace, saying they want peace, so the government should ensure it.\n\nThey said that they’re ready to fully cooperate with authorities for the elimination of terrorism, which was the enemy of all.\n\nThe participants opposed military operations or forced displacement, saying such actions are unacceptable.\n\nThey recommended the formation of a broad-based and empowered jirga, comprising representatives from the federal and provincial governments, tribal elders and all key stakeholders, to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Afghan government and people to ensure the long-term eradication of terrorism in the region.\n\nThe participants said that the initiative of local jirgas was a positive step and called for it to be made more effective so that its outcomes could benefit other regions as well.\n\nThe chief minister reportedly asked them about the options available for restoration of peace other than military operations against terrorism.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
