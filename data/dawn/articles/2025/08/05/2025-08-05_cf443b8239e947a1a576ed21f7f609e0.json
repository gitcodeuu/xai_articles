  "content": "QUETTA: Former senator Mir Lashkari Khan Raisani has announced plan to convene a multiparty conference (MPC) on the controversial mines and minerals law as the Balochistan High Court (BHC) on Monday admitted for hearing yet another set of petitions against the provincial law.\n\nA number of petitioners have challenged the Balochistan Mines and Minerals Act 2025 passed by the provincial assembly in March. It was subsequently signed into law by the governor.\n\nA two-member bench, comprising BHC Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareech and Justice Sardar Ahmed Halimi, while admitting the petitions for regular hearing issued notices to the provincial and federal governments.\n\nBesides Mr Raisani, ex-minister Mir Humayun Aziz Kurd, Barrister Iqbal Kakar, the National Party, Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam, Balochistan National Party, Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party and Awami National Party moved the petitions against the controversial law.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Mr Raisani warned the implementation of the law would result in the “displacement of locals” and vowed to resist the law on every forum.\n\nBench issues notices to federal, provincial govt\n\nHe alleged the legislation was pushed through the assembly with an “ill intent”, accusing the provincial government of effectively surrendering Balochistan’s natural resources to federal authorities.\n\nHe said a multiparty conference would be convened in the provincial capital on this serious matter next month, inviting the attention of all those parties that recently participated in a similar meeting in Islamabad towards Balochistan.\n\nHe also expressed confidence the collective efforts of the people of Balochistan and lawyers would ultimately prevail.\n\nEarlier, senior lawyer Muhammad Riaz Ahmed contended before the court that the federal government was trying to take over Balochistan’s mineral wealth. The lawyer claimed that provincial lawmakers, who voted for the law, were misled.\n\nThe bill presented to the lawmakers was different from the one ultimately passed by the Balochistan Assembly, the petitioners claimed.\n\nThey criticised the amendments to mineral regulations.\n\nUnder the previous law, passed in 2002, locals could secure mining leases for Rs500,000.\n\nThe new act imposed conditions involving investment in crores of rupees, effectively paving the way for outside corporations to take over mining operations in the province, the petitioners claimed. They alleged the law, passed “without adequate debate”, was part of an attempt by the federal government to seize control over Balochistan’s mineral resources.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
