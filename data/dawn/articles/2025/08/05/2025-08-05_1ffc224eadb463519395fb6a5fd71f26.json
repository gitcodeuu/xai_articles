  "content": "KARACHI: Pakistan’s urea sales for July totalled 608,000 tonnes, a slight dec­rease of 1pc compared to 612,000 tonnes in the same month last year. The decline was attributed to weak farm economics and the impact of the monsoon season.\n\nMonth-on-month, urea sales saw a sharp drop of 19pc, mainly due to the conclusion of the Rabi season. For the seven-month period from January to July (7MCY25), total urea offtake amounted to 2.96 million tonnes, down 19pc from 3.65 million tonnes during the same period in 2024, reflecting the ongoing challenges in the agricultural sector.\n\nDeepak Kishore of Topline Securities noted that the closing inventory of urea was expected to be around 1.28m tonnes in July, a slight decrease from 1.32m tonnes in June.\n\nMeanwhile, total DAP (diammonium phosphate) sales in July stood at 109,000 tonnes, a 33pc year-on-year decline, though it saw a marginal 1pc increase compared to June. For the first seven months of 2025, DAP offtake reached 557,000 tonnes, a drop of 21pc year-on-year. The closing inventory for DAP was projected to be around 276,000 tonnes in July, down from 323,000 tonnes in June, but higher than 166,000 tonnes in July 2024.\n\nTOMCL enters Tajikistan’s market with $3.24m in export orders\n\nKishore also anticipated that urea inv­entory levels would remain relativ­e­ly high, potentially closing Decem­ber 2025 with over 1.2 million tonnes in stock.\n\nTOMCL expands exports\n\nIn another significant development, The Organic Meat Company Ltd (TOMCL) has expanded its international presence by entering the Com­monwealth of Independent States (CIS) region, beginning with Tajikistan. In a stock filing on Monday, TOMCL annou­nced that it had commenced the production and export of frozen boneless beef, specifically tailored to meet Tajikistan’s import requirements and regulatory standards.\n\nThe company has secured export orders worth $3.24 million, to be fulfilled over the course of the current financial year. TOMCL’s expansion into Tajikistan follows earlier successes in Azerbaijan and Uzbekistan, where the demand for Pakistan’s Halal meat is increasing in untapped Eurasian markets.\n\nAccording to data from the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS), the country’s total exports of meat and meat preparations declined during FY25, falling to 114,112 tonnes ($495m) from 123,419 tonnes ($512m) in FY24. However, TOMCL’s growing presence in the CIS market suggests the potential for new opportunities and growth in Pakistan’s meat export sector.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
