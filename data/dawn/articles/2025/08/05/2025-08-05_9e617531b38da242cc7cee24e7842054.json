  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan Railways (PR) administration says the operation of trains, including Jaffar Express to and fro Balochistan will continue, as ‘adequate’ security measures are being taken to protect passengers, crew members and rail infrastructure.\n\n“The entire rail operations to/from Balochistan will continue, as we are doing our best for the safety of passengers,” PR Chief Executive Officer Amir Ali Baloch said while talking to Dawn on Monday. “Also the news related to firing on the Jaffar express is not correct,” he added.\n\nAccording to a spokesman for the PR, three bullets were fired at about 10am on an engine meant for piloting Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express train. “Keeping in view the danger, the train was stopped at a safe place on the way.\n\nAnd after security clearance, the train was dispatched to its destination,“ said the spokesman through a press release. “Later, the pilot engine also returned to its designated station safely,” he added.\n\nHe further said the firing on the engine took place between Kolpur and Dozan sections. The firing was carried out on the engine (fireman side) while no injury or casualties were reported. The crew remained safe.\n\nOn the other hand, Jaffar Express arrived at Kolpur station safely at 10:10am from where it was guarded by the FC for onward journey.\n\nRailways CEO dismisses reports about firing on Jaffar express; says three bullets fired on pilot engine\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that last week, three passenger coaches of Jaffar Express suffered derailment near Shikarpur in Sindh reportedly due to an explosion, leaving a passenger injured.\n\nPrior to this, three coaches of the Jaffar Express train derailed near Shikarpur in Sindh due to an explosion on Monday, leaving one injured. However, the railways ministry termed the explosion a technical fault, derailing three coaches. Earlier on March 11, the train was hijacked by the terrorists on the way near Bolan.\n\nSince, after the March 11 incident, the entire train operations in Balochistan have special security arrangements, covering stations, trains and destinations. The PR’s operations to and from Balochistan comprise four daily passenger trains, including Jaffar Express and Bolan Express, connecting Balochistan with Punjab and Sindh. Additionally, freight trains operate on various sections leading to Balochistan.\n\nJaffar Express begins its downward journey from Peshawar in the morning, arriving in Quetta the next day via Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, Sukkur, and Sibbi. Conversely, it departs Quetta at 9am daily, reaching Peshawar via Sukkur, Rahim Yar Khan, Lahore, and Rawalpindi at 7am the next day.\n\nBolan Express departs Karachi at 8pm daily and reaches Quetta at 6:55pm the next day, with stops at various stations in interior Sindh and Balochistan. Two trains operate locally in Balochistan, running on the Sibbi-Harnai and Quetta-Chaman routes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
