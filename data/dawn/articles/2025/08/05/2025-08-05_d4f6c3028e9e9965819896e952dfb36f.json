  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has postponed hearings in the sugar cartelisation case involving 79 sugar mills and the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) after a request was made citing the unavailability of legal counsel due to the Supreme Court’s summer recess.\n\nThe PSMA and its member mills sought rescheduling of the rehearing originally slated for Aug 4-7, arguing that their legal representatives were on leave.\n\nThe CCP has now fixed the hearings for Sept 22-25, allowing a one-time adjournment in line with directions from the Competition Appellate Tribunal (CAT), which had earlier instructed the CCP to hold day-to-day proceedings.\n\nIn a statement, the CCP made it clear that no further delays would be entertained, warning that repeated adjournment requests or non-appearance may result in ex-parte proceedings.\n\nCCP grants one-time adjournment in Rs44bn cartelisation case\n\nThe case dates back to 2021, when the CCP imposed a Rs44bn penalty on the PSMA and its member mills for cartelisation. The decision was challenged in the CAT, which subsequently set aside the CCP’s order.\n\nThe Tribunal ruled that the casting vote by the then CCP Chairperson to break a 2-2 deadlock in the quasi-judicial proceedings was not valid under the Competition Act 2010. The Chairperson, it held, could not lawfully cast a second vote.\n\nFollowing the CAT’s directive for a fresh hearing, the CCP issued rehearing notices to the sugar mills and the PSMA in July.\n\nMeanwhile, around 50 sugar mills have filed appeals in the Supreme Court against the CAT ruling.\n\nAccording to sources in the CCP, several sugar mills and other stakeholders have also petitioned the Supreme Court challenging the very establishment of the Commission.\n\nThey argue that the CCP’s functions fall under devolved subjects following the 18th Constitutional Amendment.\n\nA verdict on this constitutional matter is expected in the first week of September, which has influenced the decision to schedule the sugar cartel case hearings after Sept 20.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
