She sustained three bullet wounds and died on the spot.\n\n“The murder appears to be an outcome of ‘honour’ killing,” Dharejo continued.\n\nDuring the initial probe, the arrested man told the police that his wife used to talk with a man on her cell phone.\n\nHe had warned her not to do it, but she did not give any heed to his warning, the husband claimed.\n\nThe SHO said the husband is a labourer and hailed from Mansehra. The body of the victim was shifted to Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for legal formalities.\n\nIn Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout last year, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.\n\nData from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan shows that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.\n\nLast month, two men were shot dead while a third one was injured over ‘honour’ in Karachi’s Manghopir area, police had said.\n\nAlso last month, a man was killed over so-called honour in Sharifabad, according to police.",
