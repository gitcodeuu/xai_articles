  "content": "GENEVA: A replica of Auguste Rodin’s famous sculpture “The Thinker” outside the United Nations headquarters was being slowly submerged in plastic rubbish on Monday as countries gathered in a bid to finalise a global treaty on plastic pollution.\n\nThe sculpture will slowly disappear under layer upon layer of bottles, toys, fishing nets and other garbage during the 10 days of talks starting Tuesday, aimed at sealing the first international accord to tackle plastic pollution.\n\nSix metres tall, the artwork, entitled “The Thinker’s Burden”, is being constructed by the Canadian artist and activist Benjamin Von Wong. He hopes it will strike a chord with diplomats from the UN’s 193 members and make them think about “the health impacts of plastic pollution: not just on our generation, but on all future generations”, Von Wong said.\n\nSitting on a representation of Mother Earth, this “Thinker” holds crushed plastic bottles in one hand and looks down at a baby held in the other. “Over the course of the next 10 days, we’re going to be slowly adding more and more plastic to this art installation to show the growing cost that is being passed on to future generations,” Von Wong said.\n\n“If you want to protect health, then we need to think about the toxic chemicals that are entering our environment,” he said.\n\n“We need to think about limits on plastic production. We need to think about a strong, ambitious plastics treaty.” Well over 400 million tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year, half of which is for single-use items.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
