  "content": "QUETTA: The Young Doctors Association (YDA) Balochistan has issued a statement calling for the immediate formation of a new cabinet through elections, terming it the only solution to the growing constitutional crisis and internal disunity in the organisation.\n\nThe association clarified that only the elected cabinet of YDA Balochistan holds the mandate to issue policy statements, conduct press conferences, or initiate protest campaigns.\n\nFollowing the dissolution of the Consultative Council, YDA urged all senior members and former office-bearers to take responsibility for forming a neutral election commission to ensure free, fair, and transparent elections.\n\nThe association also rejected the decision by the principal of Bolan Medical College to evict newly-inducted house officers from hostels without providing alternative accommodation, calling the move completely unacceptable.\n\nAdditionally, the association strongly criticised the posting of house officers in under-equipped hospitals, which exist only in record as “teaching hospitals.”\n\nThe YDA called the move a mockery of public health, stating that assigning doctors to such facilities will lead to severe hardship for both patients and physicians.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
