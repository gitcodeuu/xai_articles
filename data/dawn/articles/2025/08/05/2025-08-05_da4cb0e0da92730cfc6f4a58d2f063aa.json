  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh government on Monday extended the deadline for citizens to obtain new number plates featuring the Ajrak design until Oct 31, following instructions from Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.\n\nThe decision was taken during a high-level briefing at Bilawal House between the PPP chairman and Sindh’s Excise, Taxation and Narcotics Control Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla. A number of governance matters, including record of narcotics seizures and legislative performance, were also discussed.\n\n“In view of public convenience, the deadline for installing security-featured number plates should be extended,” a Bilawal House statement issued after the meeting quoted the PPP chairman as saying.\n\n“On the instructions of [PPP] chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Sindh’s Minister for Excise and Taxation, Mukesh Kumar Chawla, extended the deadline for installing security-featured number plates from Aug 14 to Oct 31.”\n\nFollowing the meeting, the Sindh Excise and Taxation Department issued a notification announcing the extension of the deadline.\n\nEarlier, minister Chawla, who also serves as the party’s chief whip in the Sindh Assembly, briefed the PPP chairman on the attendance and performance of party members in the provincial assembly. He also shared updates on recent operations conducted by the Sindh Narcotics Department.\n\nAfter meeting with PPP chairman, excise minister Chawla announces Oct 31 as last date for acquiring Ajrak-themed plates\n\n“Mr Chawla briefed the PPP chairman that the narcotics department has seized a record haul of drugs worth Rs7 billion,” said the statement. “Under the Safe City Project, the campaign to update vehicle number plates with security features has been accelerated. With the introduction of security-featured number plates for vehicles, the overall security situation in the province is expected to improve further,” it added.\n\nThe Sindh government has faced strong criticism from opposition parties over its decision to replace existing vehicle number plates with the new Ajrak-themed design and to allow traffic police to impose hefty fines on citizens.\n\nThe opposition has demanded that the PPP stop law enforcement from taking harsh measures and waive the fee for the new plates. Protesters have also questioned the government’s priorities, accusing it of “failing” to provide basic necessities and essential public services while focusing instead on vehicle registration.\n\nPAC recovered over Rs20bn in one year, Bilawal told.\n\nEarlier, the PPP chairman was also briefed on a series of “major accountability gains” during a meeting with Sindh Public Accounts Committee (PAC) chairman Nisar Khuhro, who is also the PPP’s Sindh president. The meeting was attended by PPP Sindh general secretary Waqar Mehdi and information secretary Aajiz Dhamrah.\n\n“During the session, Mr Khuhro informed Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari that the Sindh PAC has facilitated a record recovery of over Rs20 billion within a year from various federal and provincial departments,” said the statement. “These recoveries were made from institutions including Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation, K-Electric, Pakistan Steel Mills, and Pakistan Machine Tool Factory, all of which owed significant dues to the Sindh government.”\n\nMr Khuhro, the statement said, emphasised that the recoveries were not only substantial in monetary value but also unprecedented in scale. “Even the Auditor General has acknowledged that such a high level of recovery has never been achieved before.” The PPP chairman welcomed the PAC’s performance, saying it was encouraging to see a constitutionally mandated parliamentary body fulfilling its oversight responsibilities.\n\n“The active functioning of Sindh’s Public Accounts Committee as an institutional pillar of accountability is a positive sign for transparent governance,” he said.\n\nIn a separate briefing, PPP Sindh general secretary Waqar Mehdi also updated the PPP chairman on the party’s current organisational landscape in the province and outlined structural developments and upcoming strategies.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
