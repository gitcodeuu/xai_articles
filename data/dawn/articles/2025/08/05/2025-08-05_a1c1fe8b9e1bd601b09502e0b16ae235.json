He highlighted that Mr Malik has attended various conferences on climate change and secured funds for resilient infrastructure in Pakistan. The PM, however, did not specify the quantum of these funds.\n\nHe said the ministry had a key role in “mitigating the changes arising from climate change” across the country, wher­eas the NDMA was originally established for relief, rescue and rehabilitation work.\n\nPM Shehbaz said a survey of the damage to highways and other infrastructure should be conducted and communication links of all areas should be restored on a priority basis. The premier also directed the water resources minister for an improved water system in the region. He also announced Rs4 billion for the restoration of infrastructure in GB.\n\nLater, addressing a cheque-distribution ceremony for the flood victims, PM Shehbaz recalled, “A huge cloudburst occurred in Gilgit-Baltistan, as a result of which there were immense rains and floods.” He said being one of the most vulnerable countries, Pakistan needed to be prepared against climate disasters.\n\nFurthermore, the premier announced a Daanish school and a 100MW solar power project for the region. He said the solar project’s approval would be sought from the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council.\n\nDuring his one-day trip, the premier also held separate meetings with the GB chief minister and the governor to discuss the region’s flood damages, among other matters.\n\nSeparately, Climate Minister Musadik Malik told journalists that the early warning systems had either been stolen or deliberately damaged. He said the unplanned construction in the region added to the recent disasters, saying people had built hotels and other infrastructure in the pathway of streams.\n\nGhizer residents stranded\n\nMeanwhile, the residents of Ghizer remained marooned for a fifth straight day after a flood cut off the Gilgit-Shandur road access, even as the mountainous region braces for more disasters in light of a warning issued by the Pakistan Meteorological Department.\n\nAccording to the local administration, a flooded stream in Khotom village blocked the Ghizer River, due to which the river overflowed and submerged a 500-metre stretch of the road, cutting off access for thousands of residents in Phander, Khalti, Teero, and other areas up to Shandur Top.\n\nFive stranded residents from Khotom village were, however, rescued via boat, while a search for missing tourists in the Babusar area had also been concluded.\n\nRescue 1122 officials reported that five members of a family from Khotom village were rescued and moved to safety via boat on Monday, while food supplies were delivered to other stranded families. The rescue team stated that restoring the submerged road was extremely difficult due to the rocky terrain at the blocked section.\n\nThe Gilgit-Shandur road also serves as a link between Gilgit-Baltistan and the Chitral district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Local resident Yaqoob Tai told Dawn that the road blockage occurred in a mountainous area, making the repair work particularly complicated.\n\nResidents are unable to reach Chitral because the alternative route is under construction and much longer. Locals are facing shortages of essential items and medicine amid fears that if the situation continues, a severe food shortage may occur.\n\nOn the other hand, the Ghizer district administration has contacted the Chitral administration, requesting a no-objection certificate to transport essential food and fuel supplies from Chitral to Phander Valley via Shandur Road.\n\nSeparately, the search operation for 12 tourists who went missing after rain-induced floods in Gilgit-Baltistan’s Babusar area was concluded on Monday without any success. GB government spokesperson Faizullah Firaq stated that the 14-day-long search operation on the Babusar Highway had ended. While all vehicles were recovered from the debris, the missing tourists could not be traced.\n\nOn July 21, at least four tourists died, and 14 went missing after floods swept through the Babusar area in Diamer. During the operation, seven bodies were recovered.\n\nGlof alert\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Department issued an alert for increased risk of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (Glofs), flash floods, and landslides in the glaciated regions of Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nA wet spell is expected this week, with scattered rain and thunderstorms, including isolated heavy rainfall. The PMD advised relevant authorities to remain vigilant and take precautionary measures to avoid any untoward incidents.\n\nWith input from APP\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
