The conflict was triggered by a Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, when gunmen stormed the border from Gaza, killing more than 1,200 people and seizing around 250 hostages according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe conflict has forced nearly all of Gaza’s over 2 million people from their homes and caused what a global hunger monitor called last week an unfolding famine.\n\nThat has caused widespread international anger and prompted several European countries to say they would recognise a Palestinian state next month if there was no ceasefire.\n\nInside Gaza on Tuesday, Israeli gunfire and strikes killed at least 13 Palestinians, local health authorities said, including five people in a tent in Khan Younis and three aid seekers near Rafah in the south.\n\nIsraeli tanks pushed into central Gaza earlier on Tuesday but it was not clear if the move was part of a larger ground offensive.\n\nPalestinians living in the last fifth of the territory, where Israel has not yet taken military control via ground incursions or orders for civilians to leave, said any new move to occupy the area would be catastrophic.\n\n“If the tanks pushed through, where would we go, into the sea? This will be like a death sentence to the entire population,” said Abu Jehad, a Gaza wood merchant, who asked not to be named in full.\n\nA Palestinian official close to the talks and mediation said Israeli threats could be a way to pressure Hamas to make concessions at the negotiation table.\n\n“It will only complicate the negotiation further, at the end, the resistance factions will not accept less than an end to the war, and a full withdrawal from Gaza,” he told Reuters, asking not to be named.\n\nIsrael said it would allow merchants to import goods. A source in Gaza told Reuters some trucks had already entered carrying chocolates and biscuits for a merchant.\n\nIt is hoped that essential items such as children’s milk, fresh meat and fruits, sugar, and rice could be allowed in, which would alleviate scarcity and drive down prices of what is available in the markets.\n\nUS Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said last week he was working with the Israeli government on a plan that would effectively end the conflict in Gaza.\n\nBut Israeli officials have also floated ideas, including expanding the offensive and annexing parts of Gaza.\n\nThe failed ceasefire talks in Doha had aimed to clinch agreements on a US-backed proposal for a 60-day truce, during which aid would be flown into Gaza and half of the hostages Hamas is holding would be freed in exchange for Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.\n\nThe Israeli military was expected on Tuesday to present alternatives that include extending into areas of Gaza where it has not yet operated, according to two defence officials.",
