Another military operation will only worsen the situation,” he remarked.\n\nHe criticised the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government in the province for failing to address fundamental public issues and complained the alarming number of local children are out of school.\n\n“Over 5.5 million children are still out of school in this province,” he said.\n\nThe JI emir also lamented the poor state of local governments across the country, particularly in KP.\n\n“Though local governments have been deprived of funds across Pakistan, the situation in KP is far worse. Both public representatives and citizens have been bearing the consequences,” he said.\n\nMr Rehman said his party would continue its struggle for reduction in electricity tariff.\n\n“Our campaign for lowering electricity bills will continue until real relief is provided to the public,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
