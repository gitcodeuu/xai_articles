  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has secured an extension from the International Hockey Federation (FIH) until Aug 20 to confirm the country’s participation in the upcoming FIH Pro League, as it awaits a formal response from the government regarding the provision of required funding.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the National Hockey Stadium here on Monday, PHF president Tariq Hussain Bugti said the federation had requested the FIH to extend the original Aug 12 deadline due to the pending government approval.\n\n“We asked the FIH to extend the deadline for confirming Pakistan’s participation to Aug 20 because we are still waiting for a response from the government,” Bugti said.\n\nThe FIH had invited Pakistan to replace New Zealand, who withdrew from the event due to financial constraints, in the Pro League. However, the PHF has yet to receive the green light from the authorities in Islamabad.\n\nBugti said the PHF had estimated an expenditure of Rs350 million to take part in the Pro League.\n\n“Overall, the PHF requires Rs700 to Rs750 million annually to run its affairs. We have submitted our financial request to the government and are hopeful of receiving maximum support,” he said, adding that efforts are also underway to engage sponsors to share the financial burden.\n\nCommenting on Pakistan’s potential participation in the upcoming Asia Cup in India, Bugti said the PHF would act according to the government’s directive. He, however, criticised India’s approach to sports diplomacy.\n\n“What the Indian government did by not sending its cricket team to Pakistan for the Champions Trophy, and what happened recently in England [during the World Championship of Legends], along with the threatening tone of Indian media, all raise serious concerns,” he remarked.\n\nHe said the situation between Pakistan and India had deteriorated since May 10 and the PHF had apprised the Asian Hockey Federation (AHF) of the situation.\n\n“It is premature to say whether the AHF will take action if we don’t participate, but the entire world is aware of the current circumstances,” he said.\n\nDismissing rumours of internal discord, Bugti denied reports suggesting he and PHF secretary Rana Mujahid were planning to step down. “Neither I nor Rana Mujahid are going anywhere, though some people may be dreaming of replacing us,” he said.\n\nHe defended his tenure, noting that Pakistan’s world ranking had improved under the current administration.\n\n“When we took charge, Pakistan was ranked 18th in the world. Today, we are at 12th. If anything, our performance shows progress.”\n\nBugti criticised those who had opposed Pakistan’s participation in the inaugural Pro League in 2018-19, blaming their decision for the subsequent drop in rankings.\n\n“We had slipped from 10th to 18th due to that decision. Ironically, the same individuals are now advising against accepting this new opportunity,” he said.\n\nHighlighting recent achievements, Bugti said the senior, junior, and U-16 national teams had all reached the finals of their last international tournaments. “This proves that Pakistan hockey is getting back on track.”\n\nHe also recalled the PHF’s struggles in sending the team to the FIH Nations Cup held in Malaysia earlier this year, where Pakistan finished runners-up.\n\n“We had requested Rs40 million from the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB), but only received 24 air tickets. We had to ask the players and team management to choose between receiving their pending daily allowances or participating in the event. They chose to play, and we used our limited funds to arrange accommodation,” he said.\n\nBugti said that while the PHF recently cleared the players’ daily allowances for training camps, dues for international tours were still pending.\n\n“Despite the financial crisis, we ensured Pakistan’s participation in all international tournaments over the past year,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
