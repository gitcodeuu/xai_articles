He was a newlywed at the time of the accident.\n\nThe deceased’s family has demanded justice and financial compensation. Sources allege that the mill administration sent the mutilated body home without proper medical dressing or covering, causing outrage among locals and the family.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Usman Khalid confirmed that a formal probe has been launched to fix responsibility.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 5th, 2025",
