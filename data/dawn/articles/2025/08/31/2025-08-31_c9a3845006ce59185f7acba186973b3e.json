First 15 overs with the bowling we were good, but the last five overs we need to work on. It’s something we have been working on but yeah we need to get better,” he said.\n\n“I think our death bowling is something we are working on and it’s concerning. We need to be better in the next game, but overall we have been playing really well and this is how we want to continue playing.”\n\nAfghanistan, who lost to Pakistan by 39 runs on Friday, face the UAE in the next match on Monday.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nPAKISTAN:\n\nSahibzada Farhan b Junaid8\n\nSaim Ayub c Chopra b Saghir69\n\nFakhar Zaman b Haider6\n\nSalman Ali Agha c Chopra b Saghir5\n\nHasan Nawaz c Chopra b Haider56\n\nM.
