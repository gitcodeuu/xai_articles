An investig­a­­tion has been opened into homicide and attem­pted ho­­micide, according to the prosecutors, who ruled out any “terrorist” or racist mo­t­ives.\n\n“Unfortunately, the toll is very heavy,” Evreux pu­­­b­­lic prosecutor Remi Cou­tin said. One man died at the scene, he added. Five people were injured, and two of them are in critical condition. Coutin said that “there was an altercation” between a young woman and several men.\n\nThe bouncers escorted all the patrons outside the bar located in the centre of the town of around 50,000 people.\n\n“One person went to fetch a vehicle” and “del­i­b­erately reversed at high speed into the crowd outs­ide the establishment”, Co­­u­­tin added, saying the incident had “escalated and ended in a tragedy”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 31st, 2025",
