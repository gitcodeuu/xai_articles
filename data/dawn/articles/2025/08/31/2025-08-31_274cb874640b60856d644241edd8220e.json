The dead include two children and a woman.\n\nAccording to the PDMA report, a total of six houses have been damaged due to rain and urban flooding, including three that were destroyed completely.\n\nIn a statement, the PDMA spokesperson said, “PDMA has directed respective district administrations to intensify relief efforts and ensure timely assistance to victims.”\n\n“PDMA’s Emergency Operation Centre is fully functional,” the spokesperson added, urging people to contact PDMA’s helpline at 1700 in case of emergency or weather updates.\n\nAccording to the PMD, Cherat received 165mm of rain over the past 24 hours, while Kakul received 54mm, Peshawar 41mm, Balakot 14mm, Malam Jabba 10mm, Bannu 5mm, and Dera Ismail Khan 4mm.\n\nThe latest data from the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) showed that at least 853 people have died and over 1,000 have been injured in rain-related incidents and flash flooding since the start of the Monsoon season on June 25.\n\nMonsoon rains, which fall across the region from June to September every year, continue to lash many parts of the country. Starting in late June, Monsoon rains have wreaked havoc across the country in the past month by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.",
