Authorities had collected evidence from the site, it said, adding that the injured were being provided the best possible medical care.\n\nThe deceased were identified as Muhammad Ishaq, Najeebullah, Shan, Muhammad Hanif, Madad Khan, Waqir Ahmed, Hafeez, Abdul Nabi, Nasarullah, Allah Bakhsh, Najeebullah, son of Asadullah, Allah Bakhsh and Muhammad Waqar.\n\nKech IED blast\n\nSeparately, five security personnel were martyred and three others injured on Tuesday when a convoy of security forces was targeted in a blast in the Buleda area of Kech district, near the Pakistan-Iran border.\n\nOfficials said the convoy of Frontier Corps personnel was passing near Babar Post when a powerful explosion struck one of the vehicles. Five soldiers lost their lives in the attack, while three others sustained injuries.\n\nA senior security official confirmed that the blast occurred close to the convoy. He said an improvised explosive device (IED), planted by unidentified miscreants on the roadside, was detonated when the convoy was passing through the area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 3rd, 2025",
