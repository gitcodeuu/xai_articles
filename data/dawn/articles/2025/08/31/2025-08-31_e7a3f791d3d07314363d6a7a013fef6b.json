  "content": "The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Cabinet Committee on Legislation on Sunday approved the draft of the “historic” Kalash Marriage Bill, clearing its path to be presented before the KP Provincial Assembly for ratification and enactment into law.\n\nThe Kalash are a unique, indigenous people living in the remote Chitral valleys of northern Pakistan, known for their distinct ancient Indo-Aryan culture, polytheistic religion (a form of animism), unique language and vibrant festivals.\n\n“After approval from the Cabinet Committee on Legislation, the Kalash Marriage bill is now poised for presentation in the upcoming meeting of the provincial cabinet for tabling in the KP Assembly for voting,” said Qamar Naseem, programme manager at Blue Viens and co-drafter of the legal document.\n\n“This initiative represents a significant step toward acknowledging and safeguarding the rights of Pakistan’s indigenous peoples,” he commented.\n\nNaseem appreciated the government for its commitment and cooperation in moving forward with this historic legislation.\n\nHe also thanked Wazirzada, focal person to the KP chief minister on minority issues; the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR); the Local Government Department; and all those who provided their support in drafting the bill and its passage from different government offices.\n\nHe observed that this landmark legislation will provide the Kalash community with indispensable legal protection and a formal registration system for their marriages, respecting their cultural and religious identity.\n\n“It is not only a legal reform but also a recognition of their fundamental rights,” he added.\n\nFor generations, the Kalash people have lived in the valleys of Bumburet, Rumbur and Birir in Chitral, maintaining their distinct identity through unique religious beliefs, festivals, rituals, and traditions.\n\nDespite their rich heritage and global recognition, the community has long been deprived of a formal legal framework to protect its social and cultural rights.\n\nMarriage registration has been one of the most pressing gaps, with Kalash couples lacking a system to officially record their unions, resulting in legal and social complications.\n\nThe Kalash Marriage Bill addresses this historic omission. It introduces a legal mechanism for the registration of marriages in accordance with Kalash religious values and customary practices, thereby ensuring both cultural preservation and legal recognition.\n\n“The progress of the Kalash Marriage Bill marks a turning point for the Kalash people, setting the stage for their cultural traditions to be formally respected and legally recognised within Pakistan’s legislative framework,” Naseem said.",
