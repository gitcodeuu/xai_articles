People were sitting on the roofs of their houses, waiting for rescue teams.\n\nFlood larger than the Ravi discharge capacity of 150,000 cssecs, caused severe destruction to infrastructure and property. Stormwater drains Bayan, Dek and Basanter added to the misery.\n\nThe swollen river broke its bank near the villages of Beko Chak and Jasar, damaging a small dam. More than 145 villages were submerged while three to four feet water entered homes.\n\nConnection roads linking Narowal-Shakargarh, Shakargarh-Zafarwal, Narowal-Pasrur, Zafarwal-Sialkot, Darman Road, Hanjaliwala Bridge, Darman Bridge, Fatehpur Afghan Bridge and some other bridges were damaged, leading to suspension of transportation.\n\nRescue 1122 staff continued rescue operations. Citizens trapped in water kept calling Rescue 1122 for help.\n\nNasir and Aftab Ahmed said that they have been calling Rescue 1122 for help for five hours. They said that they received a response from the rescue control room that all personnel were busy with the rescue operation.\n\nThe district administration set up 38 flood relief camps in Narowal district. A special relief camp has been set up at the University of Narowal. The camps have been provided with food, medicine, accommodation and animal treatment facilities to the victims.\n\nAccording to the Irrigation Department, the track on the Narowal-Sialkot railway section has been washed away by swollen Nullah Dek. The track has been severely damaged between Ahmedabad and Pasrur railway stations, suspending train traffic.\n\nDistrict Emergency Officer Engineer Muhammad Aurangzeb told Dawn that more than 43 rescue operations have been carried out. He said dozens of Rangers personnel and 1,390 of civilians, including children and women, were shifted to safe places.\n\nNarowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza told Dawn that food, accommodation, medicines, veterinary medicines and fodder had been provided.
