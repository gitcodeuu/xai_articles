Norway has been marked by extreme-right-wing attacks in recent years.\n\nIn 2011, neo-Nazi Anders Behring Breivik killed 77 people by setting off a bomb in Oslo and then opening fire at a youth festival on the island of Utoya.\n\nIn 2019, Philip Manshaus opened fire in a mosque in the Oslo region before being overcome.",
