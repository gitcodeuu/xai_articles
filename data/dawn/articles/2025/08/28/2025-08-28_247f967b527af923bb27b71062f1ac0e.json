Authorities in Punjab, KP, AJK and GB had been alerted, while downstream water flows were being monitored at Panjnad, Kotri and Guddu. Panjnad is expected to see a surge of 600,000 to 700,000 cusecs in the coming days.\n\nThe ISPR chief stressed that despite floods near the working boundary, army posts remained manned with “strict vigilance”, and none had been abandoned. He confirmed that two personnel had embraced martyrdom and two others sustained injuries during the relief efforts.\n\nThe military has established 29 medical camps in Punjab, KP, GB and AJK, providing treatment to over 20,700 people and distributing 225 tonnes of rations.\n\nArmy aviation had conducted 26 sorties. Three major bridges — two in KP and one in GB — had been repaired, while 104 roads were cleared in coordination with civil authorities. The Karakoram Highway is fully open, and the remaining routes in GB are expected to be cleared within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
