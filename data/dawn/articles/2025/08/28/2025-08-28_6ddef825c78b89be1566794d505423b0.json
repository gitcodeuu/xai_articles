The two sides are currently in the process of 10-year Country Partnership Strategy (2026-35) on the pattern of a similar $20 billion long-term financing collaboration with the World Bank over the 2026-35 period announced in January this year.\n\nThe finance minister reassured the ADB president of Pakistan’s strong commitment to reforms in taxation, tariff rationalisation, SOE restructuring, and regulatory modernisation, while appreciating ADB’s role as a dependable and long-standing development partner. The minister “extended an invitation for enhanced collaboration under the upcoming ADB Country Partnership Strategy 2026-2035, aligned with Pakistan’s medium-term development priorities”, the statement said.\n\nIn reciprocation, the ADB president expressed appreciation for Pakistan’s economic reforms and resilience, commending the progress achieved in stabilising the economy and advancing structural reforms.\n\n“He assured ADB’s continued support in key areas, including climate change adaptation, population challenges, infrastructure development, and resource mobilisation,” a statement issued by the finance ministry said.\n\nMr Kanda also welcomed Pakistan’s efforts towards market diversification and pledged ADB’s readiness to assist in the launch of the inaugural Panda Bond and other innovative financing instr­­­­­uments.\n\nThe ADB president reaffirmed ADB’s willingness to partner with Pakistan on its reform agenda, emphasising that ADB would continue to work closely with the Government of Pakistan to ensure sustained progress and prosperity.\n\nThe minister expressed his gratitude to the ADB president for prioritising Pakistan and choosing to visit it as the first country after assuming office, recalling with appreciation his earlier meetings with the president in Washington in April this year.\n\nHe also appreciated the ADB country team led by Emma Fan for their constructive engagement and continued support extended to the Ministry of Finance and the Government of Pakistan in advancing economic reforms and development priorities.\n\nSenator Aurangzeb briefed the delegation about Pakistan’s steady economic progress despite multiple challenges in recent years, saying Pakistan had successfully stabilised its macroeconomic framework, with inflation declining sharply, a turnaround in the current account, and recent upgrades in Pakistan’s sovereign ratings by international credit agencies, which have helped lower the cost of borrowing.\n\nHe also acknowledged ADB’s continued and substantial support to Pakistan in recent years, pointing to the Bank’s strong backing for reforms in resource mobilisation, women’s financial inclusion, disaster risk financing, and the clean energy transition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
