  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A gang of robbers allegedly looted valuables worth millions from the house of a sitting member of the National Assembly in the capital and beat and injured a police constable deployed with him, Dawn has learnt.\n\nThe robbery took place at the house of Ramesh Kumar, a National Assembly member of the Pakistan Peoples Party on a reserved seat for minorities, located about two kilometres from Shahzad Town police station.\n\nA case was registered at Shahzad Town police station under Section 395 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery) of the Pakistan Penal Code, on the complaint of the MNA’s driver, Javaid Iqbal.\n\nTalking to Dawn, Javaid Iqbal said that three armed men entered the house on Tuesday around 3am. At that time, Constable Mohammad Azam of Sindh Police, deployed with the MNA, was sleeping in the veranda and woke up.\n\nHe offered resistance, which led to a physical confrontation, he said, adding that the robbers beat him brutally and struck him with the butts of their pistols, causing injuries to his head, face and around one eye.\n\nOne of the robbers threatened him with dire consequences when he was about to snatch a pistol from another robber, Mr Iqbal said, adding that the robbers later overpowered and tied him up.\n\nThe robbers then ransacked the house, broke the doors of four rooms, and looted items worth Rs15 million, including five precious watches, four pairs of eyeglasses, seven pairs of shoes, seven pairs of clothes and a 30-bore pistol, during their more than one-hour stay in the house.\n\nThey also looted cash, but it is not yet known how much, Mr Iqbal said, adding that the MNA would check and confirm the exact amount.\n\nBefore fleeing, the robbers tied up the constable and escaped with the booty, Mr Iqbal said. After some time, the constable managed to untie his hands and informed the neighbours and police about the robbery.\n\nConstable Mohammad Azam was later taken to hospital for medical assistance, where he received 12 stitches and his face was found swollen, Mr Iqbal added.\n\nAccording to Mr Iqbal, the robbery occurred on August 26, 2025, and was reported to the police. However, the date of the incident mentioned in the FIR was May 26, 2025. He also pointed out that there was no e-tag on the FIR, despite police claiming that one is issued for every complaint.\n\nPolice said the dolphin squad or a patrolling team is the first responder whenever a crime report is received, including through the police helpline. After verifying the caller’s claim, the first responder informs the area police, they added.\n\nThe area police then reach the spot, collect details, and ask the victim to lodge a complaint, they said, adding that once a complaint is received, a number called an e-tag is issued to maintain a database and count the number of complaints and actual crime figures in the capital.\n\nThe same procedure is followed for all crime complaints, they added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
