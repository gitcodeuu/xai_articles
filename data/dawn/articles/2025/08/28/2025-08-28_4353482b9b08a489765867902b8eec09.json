  "content": "SAHIWAL: Flooding severely impacted hundreds of villages and their dwellers along the riverbeds of the Sutlej and Ravi rivers, particularly in the districts of Sahiwal and Pakpttan.\n\nThe district administrations of Pakpattan and Sahiwal had issued high alert warning to local communities. Announcements were made in mosques, warning villagers to move out from river bed.\n\nMore than 1,000 villagers were evacuated as water destroyed key crops such as rice, maize, sesame, fodder, and potatoes.\n\nAccording to Irrigation officials, this is the most destructive flood since 1988, when thousands of acres were devastated.\n\nReports indicate old embankments in the affected areas have either breached or are at imminent risk of collapse. Local residents were attempting emergency repairs, but the intensity of the water flow demands heavy machinery to effectively seal the breaches.\n\nAsif Raza, Pakpattan Deputy Commissioner, told Dawn 13,364 acre agriculture land and 24 villages had been badly affected.\n\nRescue sources said 17,000 people were earlier evacuated during the last 20 hours. So far there is no human or animal loss. Around 110 rescuers were operating in flood-affected areas with boats.\n\nA high-level flood also struck the left bank of river Ravi, affecting a large number residents and causing severe land erosion in dozens of villages.\n\nIt is reported more than 800 acres agriculture land had been affected in Chichawatni and Sahiwal tehsils. Sahiwal DC Shahid Mahmood said if high flood hit the area in coming 24 hours, 45 more villages and their 75,000 population might be affect. “We have placed a scenario mapping which village will affect at what level of flooding.”\n\nSahiwal Commissioner Asif Tufail directed the Irrigation Department to prioritize evacuation support, especially for women and vulnerable groups.\n\nHe said more than 15 camps have been established on the left bank of Ravi to provide emergency aid and monitor the evolving situation.\n\nDr Yadullah, Sahiwal Teaching Hospital MS, told Dawn all medical staff have been called and hospital is ready to provide vaccination of snake bite and other emergency medicines.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
