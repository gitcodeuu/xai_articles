  "content": "ISLAMABAD: While a large number of sanitary workers die in manholes across the country, a report on minorities has suggested imposing a complete ban on manually opening them.\n\n“The report prepared by the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR) claims that in most countries, manholes are opened through machines, but in Pakistan, sanitary workers have to go as deep as 35 feet into manholes to open them. On the other hand, mostly Christians have been working as sanitary workers,” said NCHR Minority Member Manzoor Masih while talking to Dawn.\n\nHe said that although efforts were made to implement a 5pc quota for minorities in government jobs, a 2pc quota in higher education institutions and allocation of land for minority graveyards, a lot more still needs to be done.\n\nEarlier, Mr Masih held a meeting with the Federal Ombudsman of Pakistan Ejaz Ahmad Qureshi at the Ombudsman’s Office in Islamabad.\n\nDuring the meeting, discussions focused on the protection and promotion of human rights in the country, with particular emphasis on issues faced by minority communities.\n\nBoth sides acknowledged that despite the presence of constitutional guarantees and legislative frameworks for the protection of human rights, the lack of effective implementation of existing laws remained a major challenge.\n\nIt was emphasised that coordinated efforts between institutions such as NCHR and the Ombudsman’s Office were vital for strengthening accountability, ensuring timely justice, and addressing systemic gaps.\n\nMr Masih also presented several NCHR reports to Mr Qureshi, highlighting key findings and recommendations aimed at improving governance, institutional responsiveness and public awareness on rights-related issues.\n\nThe report not only documents the challenges faced by minority communities in Pakistan but also highlights the initiatives undertaken by NCHR to safeguard their rights and promote inclusivity.\n\nThese include NCHR’s interventions for equal access to education, healthcare, and employment; its efforts to address cases of discrimination and violence; its advocacy for legislative and policy reforms; and awareness-raising campaigns aimed at fostering interfaith harmony and tolerance in society.\n\nMr Masih noted that the report reflects NCHR’s consistent work and commitment to protecting the constitutional rights of minorities and ensuring their voices are represented at all levels of governance.\n\nHe emphasised that the commission has worked closely with stakeholders, including minority leaders, civil society organisations, and government institutions, to develop practical recommendations for strengthening social inclusion and equality.\n\nThe Federal Ombudsman appreciated the work of NCHR and assured his support for enhanced cooperation in matters concerning complaint resolution, protection of vulnerable groups and promotion of a culture of rule of law in Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
