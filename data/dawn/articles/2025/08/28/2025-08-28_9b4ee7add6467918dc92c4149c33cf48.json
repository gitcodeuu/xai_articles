  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Islamabad District Health Office said on Wednesday that 122 dengue cases were reported so far in the federal capital.\n\nMinister of State for Health Mukhtar Bharath visited the Islamabad District Health Office to review the current dengue situation and the preventive measures being implemented.\n\nDuring the briefing, health officials informed the minister that a total of 122 dengue cases have been reported so far in the Islamabad Capital Territory. Of these, 107 cases were recorded in rural areas and 15 in urban localities.\n\nIt was further shared that 27 new cases emerged in the last 24 hours, while 22 per cent of the reported cases had a recent travel history to Murree.\n\nThe minister highlighted that climate change and heavy monsoon rains have significantly contributed to the breeding of dengue mosquitoes worldwide, including in Pakistan.\n\nHe emphasised the need for coordinated and effective measures to control the outbreak, strengthen surveillance systems and accelerate public awareness campaigns.\n\nMr Bharath directed the Islamabad Health Regulatory Authority to ensure the availability of ELISA tests for dengue diagnosis in all private hospitals and laboratories. He stressed the importance of the timely sharing of patient data to enable swift and coordinated response measures.\n\n“The government is committed to taking robust, integrated measures for the elimination of dengue, but public cooperation and vigilance are equally vital,” Dr Bharath said.\n\nAPP adds: The district administration in Rawalpindi has devised an urgent action plan to tackle the growing number of dengue cases.\n\nAccording to updated data released by the District Health Authority, 10 new cases have been reported in the last 24 hours, prompting the administration to implement a consistent and result-oriented plan.\n\nBesides routine surveillance and prevention strategies, the plan includes active participation of public representatives to combat the disease. With the addition of 10 new confirmed patients, the district has so far reported 88 dengue cases.\n\nDr Waqar, spokesperson for the District Health Authority, confirmed to APP that strict action was being taken against negligent health officials.\n\nHe said the health authority was working to deliver at the best possible level in collaboration with allied departments.\n\nTo review the overall situation and implementation of the strategy, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema and Member National Assembly Tahira Aurangzeb jointly chaired a meeting and directed immediate measures to combat dengue.\n\nDC Cheema has ordered effective union council-wise sweeping, surveillance and resource mobilisation to curb dengue breeding before September, considered the most favourable month for dengue larvae growth. Tahira Aurangzeb stressed that departments must swiftly address shortcomings highlighted by assembly members.\n\nIn simultaneous efforts to address the polio virus issue, the forthcoming immunisation campaign has also been prioritised in the action plan.\n\nDuring the same meeting, participants discussed arrangements for the polio campaign, which will commence on September 1 for four days.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
