  "content": "STOCKHOLM: The Swedish government wan­ts to lift a ban on uranium mining to reduce its reliance on imports as it pursues its first nuclear power expansion in half a century, the environment mi­­n­i­ster said on Wednesday.\n\nThe previous social democrat government banned uranium mining in 2018 due to concerns of water contamination and high operating costs, but the current right-wing administration is building new reactors to help shift away from fossil fuels.\n\nSweden’s deposits represent around 27 per cent of Europe’s uranium reso­urces.\n\n“It is important, given the security situation Sweden and Europe are in, that we reinforce our autonomy for critical raw materials but also for uranium and other metals,” Environment Minister Romina Pourmokhtari said at a press conference.\n\n“We don’t want to dep­end on countries where conditions are bad, countries run by dictators,” she added. “That’s why I’m pr­­oud that we are lifting the ban on uranium mining.”\n\nSweden currently buys uranium from Canada, Australia, Kazakhstan and Namibia.\n\nThe draft law is expe­cted to be enacted by parliament, where the government has a majority, in January next year.\n\nLast week, the government said it had selected small modular nuclear reactors for its first nucle­ar power expansion in 50 years.\n\nThree or five of the next-generation reactors will be built at the Ringhals plant, in southwestern Sweden, providing around 1,500 megawatts — the equivalent of two reactors.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
