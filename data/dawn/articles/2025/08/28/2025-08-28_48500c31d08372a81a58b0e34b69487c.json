  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Gates Foundation will support the World Health Organisation (WHO) in its partnership with Pakistan to strengthen preparedness and the response to ongoing monsoon floods, meeting health needs for over 465,000 people most affected people across 33 high-risk districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab and Balochistan.\n\nThe donation from the Gates Foundation, totalling US$ 1 million, will support Pakistan’s national and provincial authorities in ensuring the continuity of life-saving health services by strengthening disease surveillance, outbreak response, the availability of essential medical supplies in targeted locations, health sector coordination, and risk communication and community engagement (RCCE) to provide life-saving information.\n\nAccording to a statement, the initiative, to be implemented over the next six months, will pay particular attention to pregnant women, children under five, older people, people with disabilities and internally displaced people (IDPs).\n\n“We are particularly thankful to the Gates Foundation for this generous and timely support to WHO teams in the field supporting federal and provincial authorities to meet health needs, deliver medical supplies and save lives. As the climate crisis fuels ever more extreme monsoons and natural disasters, evidence shows that a rapid response and good preparedness are essential to preserve public health,“ said WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo.\n\nHe said WHO stands with Pakistan to save lives today and build stronger, more resilient health systems for tomorrow to protect future generations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
