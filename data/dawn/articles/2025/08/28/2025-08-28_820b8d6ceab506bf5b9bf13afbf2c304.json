I think that’s very dangerous.”\n\nUnlike in Britain, where authorities can ban fighters who use saunas to dehydrate, Japanese boxing officials can only warn fighters whose weight drastically changes between a weigh-in and a fight.\n\nOfficials in Japan are proposing a rule forcing those who regain more than 10pc of their body weight to move up a weight class for their next bout.\n\nThere is no uniform rule in world boxing about how much weight a fighter can lose and then pile back on.\n\nThe JPBA says more data needs to be analysed before a conclusion can be reached about the best way to tackle it.\n\n“What happens if we enforce a rule where a fighter isn’t allowed to gain more than 10pc of their weight and then they go into a world title fight where they’re facing someone who that rule doesn’t apply to?” said JPBA official and gym owner Kazuhiro Ryuko.\n\n“It makes it pointless to aim for the top and in fact it only increases the risks.”\n\nOther safety measures under consideration include restrictions on sparring, which JBC chief Yasukochi says is “much more intense” in Japan than other countries.\n\nHe says it typifies the attitude of Japanese boxers, who “never give up, no matter what”.\n\nHe also believes that more Japanese fighters are focusing on attack at the expense of building defensive skills.\n\n“Japanese boxers attack from the first round, it’s not about strategising and taking your time,” said Yasukochi.\n\n“As soon as the bell rings, they go straight in and attack.\n\n“That’s become the mainstream approach and I think it’s one reason why they take damage.”\n\nBoxing in Japan has a history of more than 100 years and has developed in different ways from other countries in some respects.\n\nEveryone involved in the sport in the country, from fighters to trainers and managers, must belong to a boxing club, of which there are over 150 in Tokyo alone.\n\nClubs must apply to the JBC for members’ licences and Yasukochi says requests have historically been rubber-stamped with little scrutiny because of a “long-standing relationship of trust”.\n\nAfter the latest deaths, he says stricter oversight must be introduced.\n\n“I feel that this trust is gradually being lost,” said Yasukochi.\n\nThe JBC and JPBA hope to announce concrete safety measures in September, with issues including ambulance availability and the use of MRI scans also under discussion.\n\nAll parties have stressed the need to act quickly and admit that the future of Japanese boxing is at stake.\n\n“I think it’s really difficult to reduce the number of accidents to zero,” said the JPBA official and gym owner Ryuko.\n\n“But the JPBA, the JBC and everyone involved in boxing needs to think about how to make it as close to zero as possible. “",
