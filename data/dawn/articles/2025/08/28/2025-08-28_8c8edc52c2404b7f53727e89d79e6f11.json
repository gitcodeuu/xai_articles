EY MENA is expected to engage with stakeholders, conduct market research and benchmarking, and submit projections and valuations in its final report.\n\nPSL chief executive Salman Naseer described the exercise as “a pivotal step” for the league, adding that it would help the PCB make “informed and strategic decisions” regarding the renewal cycle and the possible addition of new teams.\n\nSince its inception in 2016, the PSL has become a central part of Pakistan’s cricket calendar.\n\nThe fresh valuation comes ahead of the next commercial cycle of the league.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
