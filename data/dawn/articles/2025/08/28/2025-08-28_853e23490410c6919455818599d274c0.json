The Spring semester will begin on January 16 and end on May 31.\n\nIn the winter zone, the academic year will start on March 1, the Spring semester will last from March 1 to June 30, and the Fall semester will be from August 1 to Dec 22.\n\nEvery semester will have separate examinations, and both sets of results will carry equal weightage in the preparation of final results, according to the statement.\n\n“To reduce textbook burden for students, the government is considering splitting the curriculum into two parts for two semesters.\n\nThe current holiday schedule for both summer and winter zones will largely remain intact with minor adjustments. However, these vacation periods will be utilised for effective enrolment campaigns, free distribution and delivery of textbooks, teacher training, student summer and winter camps, and technical training programmes for students.”\n\nThe statement noted that the decision to maintain separate academic years for summer and winter zones had been taken in view of the distinct climatic conditions in those regions.\n\nIt added that the arrangement would not only provide students with ample opportunities to engage in co-curricular activities and acquire technical skills but also ensure the optimal and efficient utilisation of government resources.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 28th, 2025",
