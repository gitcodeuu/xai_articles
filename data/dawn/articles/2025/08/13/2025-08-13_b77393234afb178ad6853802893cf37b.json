  "content": "WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he might allow “a major lawsuit against” the US central bank chief to proceed, as he complained again about renovations to the Federal Reserve headquarters and renewed pressure to lower interest rates.\n\n“The damage he has done by always being Too Late is incalculable,” Trump wrote of Fed Chair Jerome Powell on his Truth Social platform.\n\nHe added that he is thinking of allowing a lawsuit taking aim at Powell’s oversight on the renovations in Washington, but did not offer more details.\n\nTrump has repeatedly lashed out at Powell this year over the Fed’s decisions to keep interest rates steady since its last cut in December.\n\nPolicymakers have been cautiously monitoring the effects of Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs on the world’s biggest economy, as they mulled the right time to lower rates further. This is because it takes time for levies to filter through to consumer prices.\n\nThe jury is still out on whether Trump’s latest tariffs will have a one-off or longer-term impact on inflation, but the president has regularly pointed to benign data to urge for rate reductions to boost the economy.\n\nShortly after government data was released Tuesday, showing that consumer inflation stayed unchanged at 2.7 per cent in July, Trump wrote on social media that Powell “must now lower the rate.” He also called the Fed’s leadership “complacent.” Trump has openly floated the idea of ousting Powell over cost overruns for the renovation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
