Rafay’s statement had been recorded, he added.\n\nThe IO stated that blood collected from Armaghan’s house allegedly matched samples taken from the body recovered from a car in the Hub area.\n\nThe report claimed that CCTV footage had been recovered showing the individuals cleaning Mustafa’s bloodstains from a carpet.\n\nAccording to him, pending forensic reports from the Punjab Forensic Science Agency had since been received, confirming that the CCTV footage was unedited and had not been tampered with.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
