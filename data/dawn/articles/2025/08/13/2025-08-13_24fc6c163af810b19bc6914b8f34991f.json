  "content": "KARACHI: After a 43pc surge during FY25, the new fiscal year FY26 began on a positive note, with sales of cars, light commercial vehicles (LCVs), pickups, and jeeps rising 28pc year-on-year in July to 11,034 units. However, sales were down 49pc month-on-month, largely due to the high base effect of June.\n\nData released by the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association (PAMA) showed significant momentum in the electric vehicle (EV) segment. The newly launched Honda ICON e EV scooter led the way, with production and sales at 313 and 303 units, respectively.\n\nUnited, traditionally a petrol bike manufacturer, also reported EV-bike production and sales of 229 and 270 units in July 2025, up from 88 and 74 units in July 2024.\n\nIn the four-wheeler segment, combined sales of Honda Civic/City, Suzuki Swift, and Toyota Corolla/Yaris/Cross rose to 1,143, 522, and 2,418 units in July 2025, compared to 790, 502, and 1,106 units a year earlier — an increase of 45pc, 4pc, and 119pc, respectively.\n\nHyundai Elantra and Sonata also posted improved numbers, selling 141 and 66 units compared to 33 and 34 units in July 2024. Suzuki Cultus sales climbed to 239 units from 96. PAMA data showed no production for the Suzuki WagonR, indicating that Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd may have discontinued the model. Meanwhile, Suzuki Alto sales dipped to 2,327 units from 2,869.\n\nEV segment sees notable expansion\n\nSales of Toyota Fortuner and Revo rose to 919 units from 558, while Hyundai Tucson and Honda BR-V/HR-V saw growth to 546 and 357 units, from 113 and 141, respectively. Haval by Sazgar and the JAC X200 recorded sales of 1,079 and 149 units, up from 824 and 102. Hyundai Porter and Santa Fe reached 395 and 77 units, versus 349 and 58, showing increases of 13pc and 33pc, respectively.\n\nMyesha Sohail of Topline Securities attributed the YoY growth to a relatively stable macroeconomic environment, lower interest rates, and easing inflation — factors that have improved consumer confidence. The sharp MoM decline, she noted, was due to a high base in June 2025, driven by pre-budget buying and accelerated purchases ahead of anticipated fiscal changes.\n\nShe added that two- and three-wheeler sales rose 44pc YoY to 122,441 units but declined 12pc MoM. Atlas Honda led with 104,276 units sold in July 2025, up from 70,255, while Suzuki’s two-wheeler sales reached 2,518 units compared to 1,643. Yamaha sold 586 units, up from 302 last year.\n\nThe tractor segment, however, saw sales fall 18pc YoY and 57pc MoM to 1,195 units, as weak farm economics continued to weigh on rural demand.\n\nTruck and bus sales reached 374 units in July 2025, reflecting a 22pc YoY increase but a 49pc MoM drop.Looking ahead, Myesha expects auto sales to maintain momentum through FY26, supported by lower interest rates and a strong pipeline of new model launches, particularly in hybrid and plug-in hybrid categories.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
