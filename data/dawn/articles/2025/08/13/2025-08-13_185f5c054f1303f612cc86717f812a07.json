Besides board members, the meeting was also attended by Islamabad Inspector General of Police Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi and other senior officers, says a press release.\n\nThe meeting was told that national flags had been hoisted on all official buildings across Islamabad, along with illuminations.\n\nAdditionally, beautiful lighting arrangements and digital streamers had been installed on all major highways, including Constitution Avenue, Club Road, Srinagar Highway, Jinnah Avenue, D-Chowk, Pakistan Monument and other key areas to further beautify the federal capital.\n\nThe CDA chairman said to celebrate Marka-i-Haq and Independence Day with national zeal, various events were being organised by the CDA across Islamabad, including flag-hoisting ceremonies, decorative lighting on highways, cultural events, fireworks, national song competitions and public programmes.\n\nMoreover, all parks and grounds in Islamabad were being adorned with beautiful lights. Additionally, branding related to Marka-i-Haq and Independence Day was also being displayed on electric and other buses operating in the city.\n\nThe Islamabad police had been instructed to ensure foolproof security arrangements across the city during the celebrations of Marka-i-Haq and Independence Day so that all events could be held peacefully.\n\nWith buildings illuminated, streets decorated with buntings and green flags, and the deployment of heavy contingents, the garrison city is also set to celebrate Independence Day and Marka-i-Haq.\n\nThe main highway, Murree Road, and other important places have been decorated with beautiful lights and national flags. The Punjab government had declared two weeks of celebrations in connection with Independence Day from August 1 to August 13.\n\nStalls selling national flags and other Independence Day items have been set up along roadsides and in commercial areas. These stalls are popular with both children and adults, who purchase flags, badges, stickers and green-and-white attire to decorate their homes, vehicles, and shops.\n\nThe festive atmosphere is further enhanced by the presence of these stalls, which play national songs in the background, making the environment even more patriotic.\n\nThe district administration has focused on Murree Road from Faizabad to Marrir Chowk, Rashid Minhas Road and other important locations, decorating them beautifully with green and white lights and flags.\n\nThe 6th Road and Chandni Chowk flyovers are also decorated charmingly.\n\nAllama Iqbal Park and other important sites have been illuminated, reflecting national sentiments, with green and white lights symbolising the colours of the national flag throughout the city.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
