They urged the government to immediately close the illegal mines operating in parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\n\nIdres Khan said hundreds of development schemes were approved in the previous tenure of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf-led government, but most of them were still awaiting initiation.\n\nHe said they wanted immediate pavement of the Shangla rough roads to avoid mishaps and improvement of cellular and internet service in the district.\n\nOn this occasion, the assistant commissioner Alpuri, Abdul Qayyum Khan, initiated negotiations with the protesters and formed a 13-member committee comprising youth. He assured that all their demands would be accepted within two weeks. The Shangla leadership announced the end of the protest, giving a two-week deadline, and warned that if their demands were not met within 15 days, they would block the Silk Road.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
