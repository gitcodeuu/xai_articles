  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Board of Governors of the National Seed Development and Regulatory Authority (NSDRA) has approved key reforms in the seed sector, including the pilot launch of a ‘Truth-in-Labelling System’ for cotton, aimed at protecting farmers from substandard seeds.\n\nThe initiative will be underpinned by clear eligibility criteria and climate-smart protocols, ensuring seed quality and traceability.\n\nThe move marks the revival of the Seeds (Truth-in-Labelling) Rules 1991, notified by the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, which mandate that all seed offered for sale or export must carry a label reflecting its quality and meet minimum purity standards.\n\nChairing the board meeting, Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain reaffirmed that quality seed is the cornerstone of agricultural productivity and profitability. He underscored the government’s commitment to enforcing seed laws, regulating the sector transparently, and eliminating malpractice.\n\nTo strengthen institutional governance, the board approved the formation of a finance and planning committee tasked with improving financial oversight, strategic resource planning, and audit preparedness. The minister said the measure would enhance transparency and operational efficiency at NSDRA.\n\nGovt revives seed quality and traceability rules\n\nOn the regulation of seed companies, Mr Hussain announced that all new registrations would be processed strictly under the amended Seed Act. Applicants must now meet rigorous infrastructure, financial, and quality compliance requirements.\n\nThe minister ordered the mandatory use of performance bonds and directed the immediate delisting of dormant or persistently non-compliant companies, prioritising farmers’ welfare over commercial interests.\n\nTo address farmers’ grievances, the minister directed the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC) to continue evaluating seed-related crop loss claims through physical verification, tax number validation, and formal hearings.\n\nHe instructed the committee to ensure swift compensation in verified cases.\n\n“Our mission is clear — protect the farmer, improve seed quality, and align Pakistan’s agriculture with international best practices,” Mr Hussain stated. “Every step we take must strengthen the seed sector and secure the future of our agriculture.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
