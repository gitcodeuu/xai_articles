  "content": "NAROWAL/LAHORE: The Hanjali Bridge connecting Zafarwal with Sialkot has collapsed due to the rapid flow of water in the Dek rainwater drain, following heavy rainfall in India-held Kashmir.\n\nThe bridge, located on the Zafarwal-Chawinda Road in tehsil Zafarwal, served as a daily route for hundreds of citizens and workers traveling to and from Sialkot. The collapse was caused by the failure of the bridge’s central pillars due to overwhelming water pressure.\n\nNo casualties have been reported. Upon receiving information, the Pasrur assistant commissioner, along with his team, immediately halted traffic and sealed off the bridge with soil barriers, reflectors and deployment of police and rescue personnel on its both ends.\n\nThe Sialkot district administration remained unaware of the bridge’s collapse for over 15 hours, reportedly due to confusion over jurisdiction. The Sialkot administration considered it part of Narowal while Narowal authorities insisted it fell within Sialkot.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Narowal Syed Hassan Raza visited the site and directed transport owners to use alternative routes. The Sialkot deputy commissioner also arrived later. He has now demanded a detailed report from the relevant department.\n\nFlood wreaks havoc in Sialkot and Narowal; heavy rains predicted in most districts of Punjab till 15th\n\nThe Hanjali Bridge was affected by the passage of more than 22,000 cusecs of water in Nullah Dek.\n\nProvincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia contacted the secretary C&W, Provincial Highway Department and other officials. He said that the C&W and other district officers were present in the field.\n\nThe construction of Hanjali Bridge was completed in 1980 and is 720 feet long, he said and added that the repair of the affected part would be completed as soon as possible.\n\nMeanwhile, severe flooding continues to wreak havoc across the region of Sialkot and Narowal. In Jestiwala village, Narowal, rapid soil erosion and a breached protective dam have placed dozens of villages at risk of submersion. The Narowal deputy commissioner, along with teams from the irrigation department, Rescue 1122 and civil defence, visited the area and initiated emergency measures. Trees were felled and sandbags were used to strengthen weak points along the rain drain.\n\nIn tehsil Pasrur (Sialkot), the safety dam near village Garar Bariyar also collapsed due to the surging Dek drain, submerging hundreds of acres of farmland. Villages affected include Kala Pahar, Rupowali, Klaswali, Panjgrai, Mandipur, Gagge, Aqi Machhi, Pan, and Udoftah. The rice crop has suffered severe damage.\n\nRelief and repair efforts are underway. The district administrations have set up nine Rescue 1122 posts and placed all departments on high alert. A 24-hour flood monitoring system is active in the Narowal control room. Water levels at Head Marala on the Chenab River reached 175,000 cusecs on Monday evening, up from 45,000 cusecs just a day earlier.\n\nThe authorities continue to monitor the situation as heavy rains and cross-border water inflows threaten to escalate the crisis further.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) and Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) jointly predicted flooding in rivers of Punjab due to rains in the upper areas and possible release of water into the Sutlej River by India in a day.\n\nThe PMD and PDMA reported that an unusual increase in the water level was recorded in Indian dams, including Bhakra Dam that was filled up to 61pc, Pong Dam 76pc and Thein Dam was filled to 64pc.\n\nFlooding at Ganda Singh in the Sutlej River returned to normal from low levels but there was a risk of further increase in the flow of the river. A warning of medium to high level flooding was issued at Marala Khanki and Qadirabad in the Chenab River.\n\nThe PDMA Punjab, Indus River System Authority (IRSA) and irrigation department are monitoring the situation of rivers and dams 24/7.\n\nThe PDMA Punjab has issued instructions to the commissioners, deputy commissioners and relevant departments to remain alert for the seventh spell of monsoon rains. Heavy monsoon rains are predicted in most districts of Punjab from August 13 to 15.\n\nHeavy rains are likely in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore and Dera Ghazi Khan. Heavy torrential rains are predicted in the upper reaches of the Indus, Chenab, Sutlej, Jhelum and Ravi rivers.\n\nThere is a risk of landslides in Murree and Galiyat due to heavy rains. There is a risk of damage to mud houses and dilapidated buildings due to rains. Passengers and tourists should be careful in view of the weather conditions and avoid unnecessary travel.\n\nThe PDMA reported the risk of urban flooding in Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Sialkot and flash flooding in the rivers adjacent to major rivers due to heavy rains.\n\nPDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said that citizens in the river basins should immediately move to safe places. In case of emergency evacuation, cooperate with the administration, he said and requested the public to take precautionary measures and aboid bathing in rivers, canals, streams and ponds and avoid picnics and unnecessary crossings near rivers in flood situations.\n\nThe PDMA Punjab also issued instructions to civil defence, rescue and related agencies to complete advance arrangements. Staff in emergency control rooms should be kept on alert. Disaster response teams of Rescue 1122 should also be kept on high alert. The public should follow the precautionary measures issued. Stay in safe places in case of urban and flash flooding. Never cross the vehicle through flowing water.\n\n(Imran Gabol from Lahore also contributed to this report.)\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
