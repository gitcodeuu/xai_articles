  "content": "Billionaire Elon Musk said on Monday his artificial intelligence startup xAI would take legal action against Apple, accusing the iPhone maker of breaching antitrust regulations in managing App Store rankings.\n\n“Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action,” Musk said in a post on his social media platform X.\n\nApple has a partnership with OpenAI that integrates ChatGPT into iPhones, iPads and Macs. Musk did not provide evidence to support his claim. Apple, OpenAI, and xAI did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded to Musk on Monday.\n\n“This is a remarkable claim given what I have heard alleged that Elon does to manipulate X to benefit himself and his own companies and harm his competitors and people he doesn’t like,” he said on X.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
