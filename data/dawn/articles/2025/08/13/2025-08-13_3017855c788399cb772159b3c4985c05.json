  "content": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) extended its record-breaking run on Tuesday, with the benchmark KSE-100 index closing above the 147,000 mark for the first time in history, despite a volatile trading session.\n\nAccording to data from Topline Securities Ltd, the KSE-100 index finished at 147,005.32 points, posting a modest gain of 75.48 points, or 0.05 per cent. The session was marked by sharp intraday swings, as the index touched a high of 147,976.98 before dipping to a low of 146,894.63, reflecting ongoing profit-taking by investors.\n\nSupport from select blue-chip stocks helped cushion the broader weakness. Positive momentum in Bank Alfalah, Habib Bank, and Systems Ltd contributed a combined 295-point uplift to the index. However, this was partially offset by selling pressure in Fauji Fertiliser, Mari Energies, Oil and Gas Development Company, Pakistan State Oil, and Bank Al Habib, which collectively knocked off 527 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation attributed the bullish close to a strong earnings outlook and rupee stability. He said investor sentiment was buoyed by speculation over US-Pakistan trade and investment agreements, potential export tariff incentives, and a rise in domestic business confidence.\n\nAli Najib, Deputy Head of Trading at Arif Habib Ltd, described the day as one of “consolidation”, noting that the index “floated in both directions” before settling above the 147,000 level, maintaining the upward trajectory.\n\nInvestors appeared to engage in selective switching and profit-taking throughout the session.\n\nOn the macro front, reports emerged that Pakistan and US officials are finalising details of a bilateral trade deal, with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb suggesting that major US investments may soon materialise across multiple sectors.\n\nMeanwhile, Barrick Gold is reportedly seeking $3.5bn from international lenders, including US-backed institutions, for the development of the Reko Diq copper-gold project.\n\nMarket participation remained robust. Trading volumes rose 13.16pc to 691.65 million shares, while the traded value increased 1.3pc to Rs44.57bn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 13th, 2025",
