Public investment has also fallen sharply, from 4pc to 2.9pc of GDP over the same period.\n\nPakistan ranks the lowest in the region in terms of total investment. World Bank data shows gross fixed capital formation in Pakistan at 12pc of GDP, compared to 20pc in Sri Lanka and over 31pc in Bangladesh.\n\n“These low savings and weak investment trends are directly linked and must be addressed to build sustainable growth,” said Mr Ahmed. He emphasised the need for robust, deep, and diversified capital markets to channel domestic savings into productive investments effectively.\n\nThe SBP chief outlined a series of recent regulatory reforms aimed at broadening participation in Pakistan’s bond market. These include the designation of non-bank financial institutions as Special Purpose Primary Dealers and the expansion of Investor Portfolio Securities (IPS) accounts to microfinance banks, the Central Depository Company (CDC), and the National Clearing Company of Pakistan Ltd (NCCPL).\n\n“These reforms unlock new investment avenues for millions of digital banking users and lay the groundwork for broader market development,” he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Ahmed expressed concern over the underdeveloped state of corporate debt and equity markets. Outstanding corporate bonds account for less than 1pc of GDP, with minimal secondary market activity and limited involvement from the non-financial sector.\n\nSimilarly, equity market penetration remains modest, with investor accounts and market capitalisation significantly lagging behind peer economies.\n\nWhile acknowledging recent macroeconomic improvements—such as falling inflation and a gradual recovery in growth—the governor noted that structural challenges like low savings and limited financial inclusion remain pressing.\n\nHe called for coordinated efforts by regulators, financial institutions, government bodies, and investors to promote financial literacy, expand market participation, and foster a transparent, innovation-driven financial ecosystem.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 19th, 2025",
