We have to look at multiple factors to judge whether an incident was simply heavy rain or a cloudburst,” he said.\n\nHe gave the example of heavy rain in Chakwal last month, when a cloudburst was held responsible for the widespread destruction.\n\nHowever, when the Met Office checked the record of observatories in Chakwal, they found that less rain was recorded than had been reported in the media, and said that the use of the term ‘cloudburst’ was incorrect in that context.\n\nAt the time, it was PDMA Punjab that had termed the incident a ‘cloudburst’ based on their own readings. However, they subsequently acknowledged the error after the Met Office issued a clarification.\n\n“The same problem occurred in India and other countries, which are using the term to refer to heavy and extreme rainfall,” Mr Babar said.\n\nMeanwhile, PMD Deputy Director Anjum Nazir Zaigham also clarified to different news channels on Monday that the recent bout of flooding was the result of rising temperatures causing glacier melt, and river overflows.\n\nHowever, a senior PDMA KP official defended terming the rains over Buner and other areas as a ‘cloudburst’ incident.\n\nHe argued that the areas which faced catastrophic floods neither had glaciers nor rivers. “Whatever happened took place in short span of time. It took between five to 10 minutes for massive boulders to come hurtling down the mountains,” the official said.\n\nThe PDMA official said that these areas had small perennial streams, which carried the floodwaters down to settled areas. Normal rains do not cause such massive floods, nor do they result in such catastrophic losses, he reasoned.\n\nHe also quoted locals and eyewitnesses as saying that the intense deluge caused flooding within minutes, which could not happen unless there was a massive downpour in a short span of time, and justified his department’s use of the ‘cloudburst’ term.\n\nGaps in disaster readiness\n\nExperts warn that these discrepancies are not just bureaucratic squabbles — they reflect serious gaps in Pakistan’s climate readiness.\n\nFormer climate change minister Sherry Rehman told Dawn it was disconcerting to see the PMD and PDMAs squabbling over “what constitutes a cloudburst and what does not”, especially when one-third of the country is coping with the aftermath of a disaster.\n\nThe Met Department, she said, needed to coordinate with NDMA to express their predictions and plans with clarity, instead of creating confusion.\n\n“These are no longer normal monsoons. That we can all see. It is important to coordinate responses for the public instead of working in unproductive silos,” she added.\n\nAnother critical weakness is the country’s lack of “instant observation” capabilities. In the words of former chief meteorologist, Dr Sardar Sarfaraz, data is the key to tackling climate change.\n\n“Without the ability to monitor weather events in real time, we’re essentially blind to the threats forming over our heads,” he said.\n\nHe explained that Pakistan currently operates around 85 automatic weather stations and roughly 110 manual observatories across its vast territory of over 700,000 square kilometers.\n\n“And according to international standards, there should be a weather observation point every 100km. The gaps in our observation network are substantial, and they must be addressed urgently. In the era of increasingly extreme weather, we can no longer afford to remain behind. Our capacity needs to grow—and fast,” he concluded.\n\nManzoor Ali in Peshawar also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 19th, 2025",
