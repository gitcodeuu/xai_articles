Following the incident, the school was closed and students were sent home.\n\nRahmatullah Wazir has also been serving as president of Wana Welfare Association.\n\nThe incident sparked a wave of protests in Wana. Thousands of students poured onto the streets, staging demonstrations and demanding the safe and immediate recovery of their principal. Dozens of private schools were also shut in solidarity, as teachers, principals, political activists and members of various social groups joined the protest.\n\nHumayun Wazir, president of the Wana Schools Union, warned that protests would continue indefinitely if Rahmatullah Wazir was not recovered without delay.\n\nThe incident drew strong condemnation from MNA Zubair Khan Wazir. Calling the abduction “deeply tragic, alarming and condemnable,” he said such acts had once again left the people of the region with a sense of insecurity.\n\nMNA Zubair urged the government and law enforcement agencies to ensure the early and safe recovery of Rahmatullah Wazir and takes stern action against those seeking to plunge the region back into unrest.\n\nAccording to a police report, a proscribed militant outfit, Fidayan-i-Islam, had circulated a pamphlet in Wana last week, warning Rahmatullah Wazir to shut down the school.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 19th, 2025",
