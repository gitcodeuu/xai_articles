However, traffic flow was maintained by creating an alternative route,” he said, adding that the highway was now fully reopened.\n\nBalochistan’s PDMA reported that 22 people have been killed and nine injured in the province as a result of monsoon rain and flooding since June 28, including two killed and one injured in Harnai yesterday due to a roof collapse.\n\nOf the remaining casualties, four people were killed and two injured in Zhob, six killed and one injured in Khuzdar, four killed in Duki, one in Ziarat, two killed and four injured in Musakhail, one killed and one injured in Kohlu, and one each in Lasbela and Loralai.\n\nDuring this period, 83 houses were reported damaged across the province, including 14 completely destroyed, along with four cases of damage to public property.
