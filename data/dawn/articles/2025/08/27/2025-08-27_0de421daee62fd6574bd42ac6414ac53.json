  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan government has expanded its flagship programme of Balochistan Awami Endowment Fund (BAEF) to provide maximum healthcare facilities, including free, life-saving drugs and medical treatment for the low-income and deserving patients across the province.\n\nAdministered by the Department of Social Welfare, the officials said that the initiative was being hailed as a transformative step for families burdened by the soaring costs of advanced medical care. With a substantial allocation of Rs7 billion, the fund is currently supporting treatment worth Rs90 million each month.\n\nThe BAEF covers a wide spectrum of serious health conditions, including cancer, liver and kidney transplants, cardiac diseases, and thalassaemia. The social welfare initiative’s zero-cost treatment model removes financial barriers for those who need it the most.\n\nSince its launch, the programme has grown steadily, delivering thousands of treatments through both public and private hospitals through partnerships with leading healthcare institutions to ensure timely, high-quality services for approved cases.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
