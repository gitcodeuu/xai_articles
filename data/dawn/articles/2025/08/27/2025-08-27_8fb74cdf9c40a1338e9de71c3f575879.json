  "content": "KARACHI: A viral video showing robbers stopping a motorcyclist in Rizvia Society, snatching his mobile phone and cash, slapping and humiliating him, has sparked questions over the role of the police, who reportedly turned the youth away when he went to the police station to lodge an FIR.\n\nAs the footage circulated on social media, Sindh Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar took notice of the incident, prompting police to claim the arrest of one of the street criminals.\n\n“When the citizen approached Rizvia Society police, the duty officer asked him to come the next day to register a complaint,” said the minister, who ordered the Central SSP to submit details about the SHO Rizvia and his performance against crime.\n\nThe home minister asked why the complainant’s FIR had not been registered. He directed all SSPs to ensure FIRs were registered without delay. He also questioned where the police had been when citizens were being looted and “brutally” beaten by the robbers.\n\nAccording to the video, four suspects intercepted a bike-rider, snatched his mobile phone and other valuables, and beat him. In the meantime, passers-by arriving at the scene were also looted.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, the police claimed to have arrested one of the suspects, identified as Kashif Karim.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
