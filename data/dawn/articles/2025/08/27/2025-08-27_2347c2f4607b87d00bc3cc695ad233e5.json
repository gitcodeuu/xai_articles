Rescue 1122 identified the woman as an 80-year-old woman, Sardar Bibi, a resident of Lakhnoor Amrial village, while the injured included Abdul Rehman, Muhammad Dawood, Ayesha Nasir, Shamim Akhtar, Bilal, Muhammad Aslam, Munir Ahmed, Muhammad Shahbaz who were buried under the debris of roofs and walls.\n\nAccording to the irrigation department, the Ravi River has a capacity of 150,000 cusecs of water while it is flowing at 155,000 cusecs at Kot Nain in tehsil Shakargarh. The rainwater drain Auj is flowing at 56,000 cusecs while rainwater Bayan has 25,446 cusecs. Rainwater Dek is flowing at a flood level of 63,762 cusecs. All three of them have high-level flooding.\n\nDistrict Emergency Officer Engineer Muhammad Aurangzeb told Dawn that rainwater from drains of Auj, Bayan and Dek had entered the crop fields while the citizens were facing difficulties due to the continuous heavy rainfall for the past 24 hours and they had started shifting to safer places.\n\n137 rescued; one dies, 15 injured in roof, wall collapses during 24-hour rain\n\n“The rescue control room received emergency calls for help from the villages, including Pachwalian, Talwandi Bhindran, Mardwal, Nadala, Lakhnoor Amrial, Darhiwal, Sajuwal, Pir Kandhala, Jarmian Singha, Madu Gol, Dawood Bhanian, Lahri and Sikmal as well as from four different places along the Pakistan-India Border,” Mr Aurangzeb said and added that the callers informed about people being trapped in the high level flood and the rescue teams carried out rescue operations using boats, life jackets, life rings and other equipment.

The floodwater entered the animal shelters and the homes of the citizens. The markets and streets of Narowal, Shakargarh and Zafarwal were inundated by about two feet of water.\n\nNarowal Deputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza, Engineer Muhammad Aurangzeb DEO Rescue, officials of the irrigation department and other officers visited the weak protective embankments of the Ravi and rainwater drains. The DC has ordered the department to strengthen the weak protective barriers on a priority basis.\n\nThe Hanjali Bridge connecting Zafarwal and Sialkot was washed away by the floodwater while roads, rails and bridges were damaged in the Narowal area.

As flood is expected to hit the Chiniot area on Tuesday night, an emergency meeting with Deputy Commissioner Safiullah Gondal in chair directed the departments to maintain attendance of their personnel at flood relief camps in parts of districts.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the farmers have set up farmhouses and built houses in low-lying areas to keep their cattle and grow crops on the banks of the Chenab. About 500-1000 people have been shifted to safer places from these areas along with their cattle and valuables on self help basis.\n\n(Aurangzeb Malik from Chiniot also contributed to this report)\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
