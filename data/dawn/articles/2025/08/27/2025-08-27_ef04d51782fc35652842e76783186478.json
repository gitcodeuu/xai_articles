  "content": "VINH: The death toll from Typhoon Kajiki rose to three in Vietnam on Tuesday, as rescue workers battled uprooted trees and downed power lines and widespread flooding brought chaos to the streets of the capital Hanoi.\n\nThe typhoon hit central Vietnam on Monday with winds of up to 130 km/h (80 mph), tearing roofs off thousands of homes and knocking out power to more than 1.6 million people.\n\nAuthorities on Tuesday said three people had been killed and 13 injured, and warned of possible flash floods and landslides in eight provinces as Kajiki’s torrential rains continue to wreak havoc.\n\nOn the streets of Vinh, in central Vietnam, journalists saw soldiers and rescue workers using cutting equipment to clear dozens of trees and roof panels that had blocked the roads.\n\n“A huge steel roof was blown down from the eighth floor of a building, landing right in the middle of the street,” Tran Van Hung, 65, said. “It was so lucky that no one was hurt. This typhoon was absolutely terrifying.” Vietnam has long been affected by seasonal typhoons, but human-caused climate change is driving more intense and unpredictable weather patterns.\n\nThis can make destructive floods and storms more likely, particularly in the tropics.\n\n“The wind yesterday night was so strong. The sound from trees twisting and the noise of the flying steel panels were all over the place,” Vinh resident Nguyen Thi Hoa, 60, said.\n\n“We are used to heavy rain and floods but I think I have never experienced that strong wind and its gust like this yesterday.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
