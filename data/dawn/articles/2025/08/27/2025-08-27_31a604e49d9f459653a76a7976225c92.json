  "content": "PESHAWAR: The Awami National Party has rejected the terms of reference for the 11th National Finance Commission, declaring them against the financial rights of provinces.\n\nIn a statement issued here on Tuesday, ANP provincial president Mian Iftikhar Hussain said the move was an attempt to undermine the financial autonomy of the provinces granted under the 18th Amendment.\n\nHe said the new NFC ToRs were not acceptable to the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n“The ANP rejects the new NFC terms, calling them an act of looting the provinces’ financial rights,” he said.\n\nMr Hussain said that Article 160(3A) of the Constitution didn’t allow a reduction in the provinces’ share in national resources, but the federal government wrongly wanted to shift the burden of development projects and natural disasters to provinces.\n\nHe demanded that every province be represented by its “own people” at the NFC to ensure the resolution of their genuine issues and financial needs in real sense.\n\nThe ANP leader said that the share of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa should be increased after the Fata merger, while the outstanding funds for Fata should be released immediately.\n\nHe also said that the share of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in the “war on terror” should be increased, as the current one per cent share was not commensurate with the sacrifices made by the province.\n\n“We [ANP] are committed to protecting provincial rights and won’t allow anyone to undermine the constitutional rights of the provinces or erode their autonomy,” he said.\n\nMr Hussain said the party would continue to make a struggle at all levels to protect the rights of provinces and ensure that they received their due share as early as possible.\n\nHe stressed the need for a fair and just distribution of resources among provinces.\n\n“We demand increased representation, share and release of outstanding funds for Fata,” he said, underscoring the importance of addressing the genuine needs and issues of the provinces.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
