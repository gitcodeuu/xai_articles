Masri was killed in the attack.\n\nThe journalists killed also included Mariam Abu Dagga, who freelanced for the Associated Press and other outlets, Mohammed Salama, who worked for Al Jazeera, Moaz Abu Taha, a freelance journalist who worked with several news organizations including Reuters, and Ahmed Abu Aziz.\n\nAt least 278 journalists, mostly Palestinians, have been killed in Israel’s war on Gaza over the past 22 months, according to Al Jazeera.\n\n“The Israeli authorities have, in the past, announced investigations in such killings… but these investigations need to yield results,” Kheetan said.\n\n“We haven’t seen results or accountability measures yet. We have yet to see the results of these investigations, and we call for accountability and justice.”\n\nDescribing this as “a shock” and “unacceptable”, he said this incident and the killing of all civilians, including journalists, must be thoroughly and independently investigated, and justice must follow.\n\nProbe stalled amid fund shortage\n\nOn the other hand, a document showed, a team of UN investigators tasked with researching cases of violence by Israeli settlers and the transfer of arms to Israel for use in the Gaza war could not complete their work due to financial constraints.\n\nThe Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory can provide evidence of international crimes used in pre-trial investigations by tribunals like the International Criminal Court.\n\nLast year, the council approved a request from Pakistan to research additional evidence on arms transfers to Israel in the context of the Gaza war and Israeli settler violence.\n\nBut Navi Pillay, who heads the inquiry, told the council’s president in a letter that a lack of funds meant it was unable to hire staff.\n\n“The Commission has started informing the sponsors of the two resolutions that it will be unable to produce these mandated reports and present them to the Council in March 2026,” said Pillay, who has served as a judge at the ICC and is a former UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nQatar ‘still awaits’ Israeli response\n\nMeanwhile, mediator Qatar said that it was “still waiting” for Israel’s response to a proposal for a truce and prisoners’ deal in the Palestinian territory after Hamas agreed to the framework more than a week ago.\n\nQatar and Egypt, along with the United States, who have been mediating indirect ceasefire negotiations throughout the Gaza war, but despite sealing two temporary truces, the successive rounds of talks have repeatedly failed to bring a lasting end to the conflict.\n\n“We are still waiting for an answer” from Israel, Qatari foreign ministry spokesman Majed al-Ansari told a news conference on Tuesday, adding: “The statements that we are hearing right now do not fill us with confidence.”\n\n“The responsibility now lies on the Israeli side to respond to an offer that is on the table,” he said, adding that Qatar did not see a “positive trajectory coming out of this escalation on the ground”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
