I mean, (my serve) wasn’t the best today, but … it came in when it mattered.\n\n“It’s an improvement from last week. I’m just trying to improve with each match.”\n\nNext up for Gauff is Paris Olympics silver medallist Donna Vekic.\n\nTwice former champion Naomi Osaka dismantled Belgium’s Greet Minnen 6-3 6-4 while sporting a crystal-encrusted red Nike outfit.\n\n“I just thought it would be really fun to do a New York under the lights,” Osaka explained of her custom ensemble.\n\n“This is my night outfit, so hopefully I’ll wear my day outfit next time.”\n\nElsewhere, 10th seed Lorenzo Musetti outlasted big-serving Frenchman Giovanni Mpetshi Perricard 6-7(3) 6-3 6-4 6-4 at the Louis Armstrong Stadium and will face Belgian David Goffin, while American eighth seed Amanda Anisimova rolled past Australian Kimberly Birrell 6-3 6-2.\n\nAfter Daniil Medvedev’s chaotic exit on Sunday, Marin Cilic became the latest former champion to be knocked out as 23rd seed Alexander Bublik beat the Croat 6-4 6-1 6-4 on Grandstand, while US 14th seed Tommy Paul made short work of Denmark’s Elmer Moller 6-3 6-3 6-1 to book a second-round clash with Portugal’s Nuno Borges.\n\nThird seed Alexander Zverev closed out the evening’s action on the main showcourt by beating Chile’s Alejandro Tabilo 6-2 7-6(4) 6-4 to set up a meeting with Briton Jacob Fearnley.",
