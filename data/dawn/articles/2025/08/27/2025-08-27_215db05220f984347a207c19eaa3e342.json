  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to implement a faceless, technology-driven customs inspection and valuation system aimed at curbing corruption, facilitating trade, and improving revenue collection.\n\nChairing a meeting on Tuesday to review ongoing reforms in customs assessment and inspection, the prime minister stressed the need to align the system with international best practices by integrating artificial intelligence (AI), reducing human intervention, and streamlining administrative processes.\n\nHe emphasised that the ultimate goal is to ensure transparency and efficiency across ports and border points.\n\nMr Sharif instructed the FBR to minimise processing times for customs-related procedures, improve cargo clearance at ports, and enhance coordination among all relevant departments under a unified strategy. He said the rising volume of imports and exports demands a well-coordinated system to ensure timely clearance and delivery of goods, which is crucial for boosting business activity and investor confidence.\n\nAn official statement following the meeting said the prime minister reiterated his commitment to fostering economic growth through trade and investment reforms. He directed that transparent and impartial officers be appointed to hear appeals in customs valuation cases and that the appeals process itself be made more efficient and credible.\n\nOfficials briefed the meeting that the use of AI-powered scanning systems is already reducing clearance times significantly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
