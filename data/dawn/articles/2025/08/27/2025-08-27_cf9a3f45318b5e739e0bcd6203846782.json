  "content": "WASHINGTON: Presi­dent Donald Trump on Tuesday nominated Ser­gio Gor, a top White House official, for two high-profile roles: US ambassador to India and special envoy for South and Central Asian Affairs. Both positions require Senate confirmation.\n\nGor, 38, currently ser­ves as Trump’s director of presidential personnel, overseeing the vetting of appointees across the federal government. He has been a long-time Trump ass­ociate, working on pre­sidential campaigns, running a major Super PAC, and co-publishing books with the Trump family.\n\nDespite his close ties to the president, Gor has no diplomatic experience. Trump highlighted Gor’s loyalty and administrative work, noting that he “hi­red nearly 4,000 Am­e­rica First Patriots across every Department of our Federal Government.”\n\nThe dual appointment is unusual, combining the ambassadorship to India with a broader regional role covering South and Central Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Ban­gladesh, Nepal, Sri Lan­ka, and others. Ana­lysts note that this could signal a shift in US policy, effectively reducing Ind­ia’s “special status” by placing it alongside its neighbors, including Pakistan.\n\nGor was born Sergey Gorokhovsky in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, and later moved to the United States. He gravitated toward the Republican Party and the MAGA movement, eventually becoming a close confidant of Trump and Donald Trump Jr. He has previously clashed with figures like Elon Musk while vetting appointments, reinforcing his reputation as a stringent loyalty tester.\n\nFor Pakistan and the wider region, Gor’s dual role raises questions about US diplomatic focus. If India becomes the regional hub for South and Central Asian affairs, it could pote­ntially alter the dynamics of regional politics.\n\nThe move also has significant implications for US-India trade ties. With Gor overseeing multiple countries, India’s trade issues may no longer rec­eive the dedicated attention a traditional ambassador would provide. The Trump administration may increasingly view trade matters in a regional context, linking tariffs, sanctions, or export controls to broader strategic concerns.\n\nThe existing 50 percent tariff on Indian goods, imposed over India’s oil imports from Russia, could be a signal of how aggressively the US may enforce its trade policies. At the same time, negotiations over future trade agreements may become more transactional and slower, as India now shares Gor’s attention with other regional priorities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 27th, 2025",
