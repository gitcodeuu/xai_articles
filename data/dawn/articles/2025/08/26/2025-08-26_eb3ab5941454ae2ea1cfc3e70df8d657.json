  "content": "SAHIWAL: A cook working on daily wage at the Sahiwal Coal-Fired Power Plant has registered a case against two security personnel of the plant, accusing them of repeated gang rape and blackmail.\n\nAccording to the sources at the Yousafwala Police Station, the plant’s security focal person and his cousin had been booked on charges of gang rape and blackmail through a video on complaint of the victim, a resident of Mohalla Noor Park, Sahiwal.\n\nThe victim, who has been working at the plant for the past three years, became acquainted with the accused at the facility’s entrance gate. In his statement, he alleged that about one year ago, both the suspects invited him to their residence at Chak 61/5-L under the guise of friendship. There, they raped him and recorded the act on a mobile phone.\n\nThe complainant further stated that the accused repeatedly exploited him thereafter, threatening to share the video with the plant management and jeopardise his employment. He alleged that the most recent incident occurred on July 19, 2025.\n\nThe police have launched an investigation but no arrests has been made so far.\n\nCRACKDOWN: The Punjab Enforcement and Regulatory Authority (Pera) launched a crackdown on illegal encroachments at Chak 90/9-L, targeting the main bazaar, Arifwala Road, and surrounding areas near the bypass.\n\nThe drive led to the removal of an unauthorised Sunday bazaar, makeshift stalls, temporary tandoors and other illegal structures within the village.\n\nAccording to Nouman Qasir, sub-divisional enforcement officer (SDEO), major roadside encroachments and pushcarts around Arifwala Bridge and Arifwala Road were also cleared, restoring the traffic flow till the Bypass Chowk. Local residents expressed relief over the improved mobility and pedestrian access.\n\n“Encroachments not only diminish the city’s visual appeal but also obstruct public movement,” said Deputy Commissioner Shahid Mahmood.\n\nHe added that Pera teams were conducting daily surveillance to identify areas where land mafia was attempting to re-establish its illegal setups and strict action was being taken without exception.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 26th, 2025",
