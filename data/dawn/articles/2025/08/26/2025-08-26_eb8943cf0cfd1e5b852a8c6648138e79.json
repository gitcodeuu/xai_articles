I knew people around the world and around the United States were really rooting for me, and that felt great.”\n\nWith the American exiting, 2022 men’s champion Alcaraz took centre-stage in the late game in his first round tie against unseeded American Reilly Opelka.\n\nThe Spaniard arrived for the game sporting a striking new hairstyle — a severe crew cut — and he duly chopped down the 6ft 11in Opelka with a blistering 6-4, 7-5, 6-4 victory in 2hr 5min.\n\n“Today was a really difficult one,” Alcaraz said.\n\n“Reilly is a great, tough player. I couldn’t get the rhythm that I wanted to get but I’m just really happy with what I did today. I did a great performance today.”\n\nAlcaraz is chasing a second US Open title following his maiden Grand Slam victory at the tournament three years ago.\n\nAustralian Open winner Madison Keys became the highest-ranked player to exit so far, the sixth seed losing to Mexico’s Renata Zarazua 6-7 (10/12), 7-6 (7/3), 7-5.\n\n“Today was the first time in a while where my nerves really got the better of me and it kind of became a little bit paralyzing,” home hope Keys said.\n\n“I was just slow, I wasn’t seeing things the way that I wanted to, which I feel like resulted in a lot of bad decisions and lazy footwork.”\n\nCzech Republic’s Barbora Krejcikova bundled out rising Canadian star Victoria Mboko, defeating the teenager 6-3, 6-2.\n\nBelgian 19th seed Elise Mertens ousted wild card Alyssa Ahn 6-1, 6-0 while Ukrainian 30th seed Dayana Yastremska exited in a 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (7/5), 6-4 loss to Russia’s Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.\n\nTwo-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova brought the curtain down on her career after a 6-1, 6-0 defeat to France’s Diane Parry.\n\nThe 35-year-old Czech had already announced her intention to retire after the US Open, but was nonetheless overcome with emotion as she said farewell to the sport, breaking down in tears as she addressed fans afterwards.\n\n“I hoped I would put on a better show today,” Kvitova said.\n\n“It was tough to know it could be my last match, and emotionally it was very tough as well.”\n\nQualifier Coleman Wong became the first man from Hong Kong to record a victory in a Grand Slam singles event in the Open era with a 6-4, 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) defeat of US player Aleksandar Kovacevic.\n\nIt was the latest in a series of breakthrough results by young Asian players at this year’s US Open.\n\nAlexandra Eala of the Philippines — who trains with Wong at Rafael Nadal’s academy in Spain — and Indonesia’s Janice Tjen both won their first-round matches in the main draw.\n\nBritish fifth seed Jack Draper needed four sets to get past Argentina’s Federico Gomez, 6-4, 7-5, 6-7 (7/9), 6-2.\n\nOther seeds to advance included Norway’s Casper Ruud, the 12th seed, who downed Austria’s Sebastian Ofner 6-1, 6-2, 7-6 (7/5).\n\nUS 17th seed Frances Tiafoe beat Japan’s Yoshihito Nishioka 6-3, 7-6 (8/6), 6-3.",
