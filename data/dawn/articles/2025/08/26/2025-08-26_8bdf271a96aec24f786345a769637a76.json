Similarly, members of All Revenue Employees Association (AREA) Sindh staged protest outside the offices of Senior Member Board of Revenue.\n\nIn Badin, the government employees observed strike, bringing educational and administrative activities to a halt.\n\nLocal alliance leaders, who led the protest, reiterated their demands and said that employees in Sindh were being deprived of the rights and facilities that were being provided to their colleagues in other provinces.\n\nThey vowed to continue the struggle until their demands were accepted and a formal notification to that effect was issued by the government.\n\nIn Nawabshah, Sanghar and Naushahro Feroze districts, government employees observed strike, took out rallies and held demonstrations.\n\nThey demanded immediate reversal of the proposed reforms, revival of quota in jobs for deceased employees, group insurance etc.\n\nSimilar protests were held in Moro, Sakrand, Daur, Mehrabpur and other towns.\n\nIn Sukkur, Shikarpur, Jacobabad, Kandhkot-Kashmore, Ghotki and Khairpur districts, the employees, including women, staged demonstrations and sit-ins outside press clubs.\n\nThe protesters’ leaders condemned Sindh government’s anti-employees decisions and urged authorities to give employees their legitimate rights.\n\nThey pointed out that despite 200 per cent inflation in the country, the government employees’ salaries in Sindh had been raised only by 12pc.\n\nIn Umerkot and Kunri, educational and administrative activities remained suspended after teachers and government employees boycotted work and staged protests.\n\nThe protesters put locks on schools, colleges and government offices, wore black armbands and took to the streets. The new law discriminated against low-ranking employees, they said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 26th, 2025",
