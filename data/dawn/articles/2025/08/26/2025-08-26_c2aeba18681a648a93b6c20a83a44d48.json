Two civilians from Hatnar Dara, caught in the crossfire, lost their lives.\n\nA senior official of the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment (CTD) of police told Dawn that the bodies of all five terrorists were in police custody. They might have links across the border in Afghanistan, he said.\n\nIn Lower Dir’s Lajbook Dara area, heavy firing broke out between police and militants. Though no casualties were reported from this clash, tension gripped the area as the attackers torched police vehicles including two pick-up trucks and a car, locals said. Sharing the footage on social media, the outlawed TTP claimed they had “seized the vehicles and destroyed them”.\n\nPolice officials, however, claimed the situation was under control. “We will never bow down to the mischief of the Kharijites (militants),” a police officer said.\n\nThree civilians among the slain; seven terrorists killed in Upper Dir, Hangu engagements\n\nCop martyred in Bajaur\n\nIn Bajaur district, a policeman from Lower Dir was martyred in militant firing.
