He was also apprised of the challenges being faced by the department and strategies to overcome these problems.\n\nThe federal force will also be used to retrieve railway land from grabbers\n\nMr Abbasi, on the occasion, told the interior minister about the upgrade of various railway stations, including Lahore, Rawalpindi, Khanewal, Okara and Faisalabad.\n\nWhile discussing the issue of absence of any shuttle train service between the twin cities (Rawalpindi and Islamabad Margala stations), Mr Naqvi assured Mr Abbasi that senior officials of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) would soon contact the railway’s officers concerned to discuss a plan in this regard.\n\nIn response, Mr Abbasi agreed to launch a DMU shuttle train between the twin cities.\n\nAccording to a senior PR officer, DMU train consists of two specially designed small locomotives attached to a rake of 4-5 modern coaches on the front and rear ends, having a capacity to carry around 400 passengers.\n\nDuring the meeting, the security measures for the PR assets were reviewed in detail. The interior minister was briefed on special measures taken for the security of railway lines and trains across the country, particularly in Balochistan.\n\n“Every possible measure will be taken to ensure a foolproof security of railway tracks and trains, and full assistance will be provided to the Railway Police,” said Mr Naqvi, adding that the passengers’ safety was his top priority.\n\nHe also appreciated the measures taken by Mr Abbasi to improve the PR’s performance.\n\nThe PR Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Aamir Ali Baloch, Inspector General of Railway Police Rai Tahir and other senior officials also attended the meeting.\n\n“The meeting remained very productive, as the interior minister has agreed to provide us FC troops for launching a coordinated operation to retrieve our precious commercial land and eliminate encroachments,” Mr Abbasi told Dawn after the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Abbasi reprimanded the PR’s mechanical department for slackness in resolving various issues. “The rolling stock is the lifeline of the railway, and all efforts to keep it running in good condition must be made,” he said while presiding over a meeting.\n\n“Nothing should be pushed under the carpet, as everything must be crystal clear,” he said, adding that the officers concerned should avoid buying any parts for the trains without the third-party evaluation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 26th, 2025",
