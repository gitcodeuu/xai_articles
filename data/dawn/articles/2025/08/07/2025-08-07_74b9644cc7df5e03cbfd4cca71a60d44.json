He also emphasised the urgent need to review and enhance the ADP allocation for the justice sector.\n\nHe further stressed that targeted investment in infrastructure, digital integration and resource enhancement, particularly in the district judiciary of the provincial metropolis, would enable faster and more efficient dispensation of justice and called upon all relevant stakeholders to collaborate in developing a comprehensive plan for the uplift of district-level judicial facilities in the province.\n\nThe CJP acknowledged the vital role of the bar in ensuring access to justice and pointed out the existing coordination gap between bar associations and the Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP) in advancing justice sector reforms.\n\nHe also reaffirmed the LJCP’s decision to post senior-level representatives in every province, stationed at the high courts, to serve as focal points for liaison with district bar associations.\n\nThe CJP further urged the leaders of the bar to sensitise their members about these initiatives and to proactively submit proposals for infrastructure and capacity-building projects through the respective district development committees headed by district and sessions judges.\n\nHe directed that government-provided support to bar associations be streamlined, structured and duplication-free to ensure efficiency and optimal utilisation of resources.\n\nThe federal secretary law informed the meeting that allocations to bar associations were generally determined based on the number of registered lawyers.\n\nIn the case of Balochistan, the allocation has been increased from 6.3pc to 10pc, exceeding even its NFC formula share. The CJP said that the allocation for Sindh should likewise be reconsidered in light of its larger case volume and requirements.\n\nLawyers’ delegation calls on CJP\n\nMeanwhile, the CJP also met with a delegation of lawyers from across Sindh comprising representatives of the Pakistan Bar Council, Sindh Bar Council and High Court Bar Association.\n\nHe also unveiled a legal aid programme designed to ensure that no litigant is left without representation.\n\nUnder this initiative, financially vulnerable litigants will be provided legal counsel at state expense at every tier of the justice system, and bar associations will be invited to nominate capable lawyers for such assignments in coordination with the judges concerned.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2025",
