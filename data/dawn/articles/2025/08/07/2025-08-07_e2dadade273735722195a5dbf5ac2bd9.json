Subsequently, the witnesses chased him for a long time, but he managed to escape,” it added.\n\nThe complainant said he, the victim’s father, and the witnesses went to the suspect’s father — who was also booked in the case as a co-accused.\n\n“The suspect’s father started cursing and threatening me due to a previous fight and an ongoing land dispute,” the complainant said, adding, “I believe the suspect raped the girl on his father’s instructions.”\n\nA case was registered at the Rohilanwali police station under Sections 109 (punishment for abetment) and 376 (iii) (punishment for rape of a minor) of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n\nDespite the presence of anti-rape laws — with punishment for rape either resulting in the death penalty or imprisonment of between 10 and 25 years — cases continue to prevail in the country.\n\nA madrassah teacher in Muzaffargarh was arrested for allegedly raping an 11-year-old student at a seminary in May.\n\nIn April, a 17-year-old girl died by suicide after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Muzaffargarh.\n\nThe same month, police arrested five suspects for their alleged involvement in the gang rape of a child in Muzaffargarh.",
