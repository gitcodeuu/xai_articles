These parallel increases underline the continued centrality of agriculture as both a livelihood and a critical pillar of the national economy.\n\nFederal Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal officially launched the results of the census, which was conducted using a fully integrated digital methodology for the first time. The Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS) employed real-time mapping, geo-tagging, and automated data systems to ensure accurate and efficient data collection at the field level.\n\nAccording to the report, Punjab accounts for the highest share of agricultural households at 43.3pc, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (35.67pc), Sindh (15.61pc), and Balochistan (5.41pc). The area under cultivation also expanded significantly — from 42.6 million acres in 2010 to 52.8 million acres in 2024 — a 24pc increase. Punjab holds the largest share of cultivated land at 56.25pc, followed by Sindh (15.36pc), Balochistan (14.68pc), and KP (13.71pc).\n\nFirst integrated digital agriculture census shows 40pc rise in farm households and 24pc expansion in cultivated land since 2010\n\nThe report highlights that 79pc of cultivated land is irrigated through canals and tube-wells, underscoring Pakistan’s heavy reliance on managed water systems.\n\nThe livestock census records 95.8 million goats, 55.8 million cattle, 47.7 million buffaloes, 44.5 million sheep, 4.8 million asses, and 1.5 million camels — reflecting consistent growth in the sector since 2006.\n\nIn a formal statement, the PBS hailed the exercise as a milestone in national data collection, stating that the digital integration, coupled with coordinated execution, sets a new benchmark for future censuses and surveys. The data is expected to enhance policy-making, improve resource allocation, and lead to more targeted and inclusive interventions for the farming community.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2025",
