The Shabdaraz team ascended via the Italian Route, climbed by an Italian expedition in 2019. For descent, the team navigated a different, previously unused route, showcasing their adaptability and confidence in unexplored high-altitude terrain.\n\nMueezuddin is affiliated with an adventure sports initiative ‘Zom Connection’. In addition to leading the climb, he provided comprehensive technical training and mentorship to the entire team in preparation for the expedition.\n\nHis leadership was instrumental in navigating the team safely through complex glacier systems, steep rock faces, and mixed alpine terrain, playing a critical role in the overall success and safety of the mission.\n\nShabdaraz Thalo Zom Expedition 2025 was the first-ever local Chitrali youth-led expedition to summit any peak and lasted a total of 11 days.\n\nThe team spent three nights at the base camp: two during ascent and one night during the descent, whereas it spent a night at camp 1 at an altitude of 4,700 metres.\n\nAt camp 2, which was located at an altitude of 5,400 metres, the team spent two nights, one each during ascent and descent.\n\nThis expedition is a milestone for local mountaineering in Chitral and sets a precedent for future youth-led alpine expeditions in Pakistan’s high mountain regions. It also highlights the growing capabilities of community-based organisations like Shabdaraz to lead high-standard, self-sufficient climbing missions in the Hindu Raj and beyond, said Athar Azeem, one of the mountaineers.\n\nHe said the expedition cost up to Rs1.5 million and they received support in the form of gear from the Hindukush Snow Sports Club and the Zom Connection, a France-based mountaineering startup.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2025",
