  "content": "SWAT: A heavy exchange of fire broke out on Wednesday between terrorists, believed to be affiliated with the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, and the Swat police in the remote mountainous area of Dop Sar, located in Gwalerai region of Matta tehsil.\n\nDuring the crossfire, a civilian, identified as Jahan Baha of Upper Dir district, was killed, while a constable, Sahibzada sustained critical injuries.\n\nFor several days leading up to the incident, residents of Gwalerai and surrounding villages had been raising concerns on social media regarding the unusual movement of armed men in the hills and even inside populated areas. Locals had warned of a possible terrorist presence and called for immediate action by the authorities.\n\nIn response to the mounting concerns, a large contingent of police was deployed to Dop Sar, as confirmed by Swat police spokesperson Moin Fayaz.\n\nRegional Police Officer, Malakand, Sher Akbar also visited the area, conducted a thorough assessment of the situation and issued necessary directives to the officers and personnel on the ground.\n\nSwat district police officer Mohammad Umar Khan accompanied him.\n\nSpeaking to media, RPO Sher Akbar stated that approximately 25 terrorists had infiltrated the Dop Sar mountainous region from the Dir border and were currently hiding in the forested area.\n\n“We have over 7,000 policemen in Swat, fully equipped with state-of-the-art weapons. We are capable of tackling the terrorists without requiring army assistance. The police force has been mobilised to the area and remains on high alert to intercept and eliminate the threat,” he said.\n\nSwat, a region still haunted by memories of Taliban occupation from 2007 to 2009, witnessed a similar situation in 2022 when reports surfaced that fugitive terrorists were being allowed to re-enter from Afghanistan during the PTI-led government.\n\n“The news sparked widespread public outrage and led to the formation of Swat Olasi Pasoon (Swat Public Uprising), a grassroots civil movement,” said Sajid Aman, a local activist. He noted the movement mobilised thousands of citizens in mass protests and sit-ins, demanding firm action from the state to prevent the return of terrorists.\n\nMeanwhile, Saidu Medical College students organised a peace march on Wednesday. Students from Jahanzeb College and other institutions, along with members of civil society, also took part in the walk.\n\nThe participants carried banners, placards, and posters inscribed with messages of peace. They chanted slogans calling upon the government to ensure durable peace not only in Swat but across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2025",
