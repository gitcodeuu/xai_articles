  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Repeated incidents of rainwater accumulation and flood-like situations in various parts of Islamabad prompted Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday to take “serious notice” and order immediate rescue operations.\n\nTorrential rain caused a flood-like situation in the Chattha Bakhtawar area, where rainwater entered several houses. However, no loss of life was reported.\n\nMeanwhile, due to water accumulation, a portion of one lane of Murree Road, along with the Bhara Kahu bypass, became nearly impassable for traffic. Motorists heading towards Murree were forced to use the second lane.\n\nDuring a site visit, it was observed that the area where the bypass ends towards Murree had one lane of the old Murree Road completely choked due to rainwater.\n\nRecurring urban floods in Islamabad draw Shehbaz’s attention\n\n“We have been facing a flood-like situation during every rainfall on this part of the road. The authorities concerned should take notice and resolve the issue,” said Malik Israr, a resident of Bhara Kahu.\n\nIn the downstream area of Rawal Dam, specifically in Chattha Bakhtawar, rainwater entered multiple homes across several streets.\n\nWater entered streets 4, 5, 6, 7 and lane number 12, affecting over 50 houses. The Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) rescue team, led by Dr Abdur Rehman and Director Zafar Iqbal, supervised the rescue operation.\n\nSources said more than 30 rescue officials took part in the operation.\n\nDownstream of Rawal Dam lies a large nullah known as Gumrah Kas, where illegal construction has allegedly taken place within the right of way.\n\n“There is a need for proper demarcation of Nullah Korang in the upstream and downstream areas, including Gumrah Kas,” said an official source.\n\nHe added that the involvement of revenue officials in encroachments along the nullahs’ right of way could not be ruled out.\n\nTherefore, proper demarcation should be conducted by independent officials using modern technology, including satellite imagery. “Google images should be used,” he said, suggesting that the federal government should review all land demarcations carried out by the ICT revenue staff and CDA over the past 10 years.\n\nIt is relevant to note that rainwater has become a persistent issue for city authorities. The first monsoon rain caused the Serena underpass to choke, making the road impassable for half an hour.\n\nRainwater later accumulated in the Diplomatic Enclave, followed by damage to a road at the F-8 interchange. More recently, a flash flood swept away three cars and several motorbikes in the Saidpur area. In DHA-5, a father and daughter tragically lost their lives when the Sawan River swept away their car.\n\nAfter the Saidpur incident, the CDA chairman chaired a meeting and directed a large-scale operation to remove all alleged encroachments from the nullahs’ right of way.\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, while taking notice of water accumulation in residential areas, directed the CDA and district administration to immediately launch rescue operations and ensure the swift drainage of rainwater from affected neighbourhoods near stormwater drains.\n\nExpressing concern over the plight of residents in flood-prone zones, the prime minister instructed relevant authorities to implement precautionary measures to protect those living near streams and nullahs.\n\nHe also directed the health department to remain on high alert and take proactive steps to prevent the outbreak of waterborne diseases following the rainfall.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2025",
