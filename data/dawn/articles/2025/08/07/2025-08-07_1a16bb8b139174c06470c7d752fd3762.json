The flood waters struck them in 15 seconds.”\n\nUttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami said the flood was caused by an intense “cloudburst” of rain and that rescue teams were deployed “on a war footing.”\n\nA large part of the town was swamped by mud, with officials estimating it was 50 feet deep in places, swallowing some buildings entirely.\n\nClimate change experts warned the disaster was a “wake-up call”.\n\nHydrologist Manish Shrestha said the 270 millimeters (10 inches) of rain that fell within 24 hours was an “extreme event”.\n\n“Such intense rainfall events are becoming increasingly common and could be linked to climate change,” said Shrestha, from the Nepal-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.\n\nHarjeet Singh, a climate activist from the Satat Sampada Climate Foundation in New Delhi, said the problem was exacerbated by “unscientific, unsustainable, and reckless construction” in the name of development.\n\n“Global warming is super-charging our monsoons with extreme rain,” Singh said. “The devastating loss … must be our final wake-up call.”\n\nChina evacuates thousands\n\nMeanwhile, tens of thousands of people have been evacuated as heavy rains batter southern China, flooding homes and triggering landslides, state media said on Wednesday.\n\nIn southern Guangdong province, a landslide in its capital, Guangzhou, trapped 14 people.\n\nOne person was later confirmed dead, state broadcaster CCTV said.\n\nMore than 75,000 people in Guangdong had been evacuated by noon on Wednesday, according to CCTV Footage showed people wading in waist-deep water and clinging to a submerged car.\n\nOf the 14 people trapped by the landslide that hit Guangzhou’s Dayuan village around 8:30am seven had been rescued and were “not in immediate danger,” CCTV reported.\n\nThe body of an eighth person was recovered later in the evening, and rescue efforts for the remaining missing were continuing.\n\nAuthorities activated an emergency response in Guangdong due to severe flooding.\n\nThe central government is also allocating 100 million yuan for the recovery effort, stating that continuous rainfall had caused “heavy casualties and property losses.”\n\nHeavy rains in northern Beijing killed 44 people last month, with the capital’s rural suburbs hit the hardest.\n\nA landslide in a village in Hebei province, which encircles Beijing, killed another eight people.\n\nNatural disasters are common across China, particularly in the summer when some regions experience heavy rain while others bake in searing heat.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2025",
