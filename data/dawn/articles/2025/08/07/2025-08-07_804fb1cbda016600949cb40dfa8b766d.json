However, they left the hall after NA Speaker Ayaz Sadiq denied them permission, saying points of order were not allowed during Question Hour.\n\nAfter the opposition walked out of the house, the proceedings were suspended on account of the quorum.\n\nAfter the session resumed, PTI interim chairman Gohar Ali Khan, while speaking in the house, decried the treatment meted out to the former ruling party in the lead-up to and after the 2024 polls.\n\nHe said the PTI’s seats were being “snatched” through courts and warned that such convictions and disqualifications threatened the democratic process.\n\nHe said this was the first time in history that key opposition leaders had been disqualified, adding that the ECP transgressed its authority by disqualifying PTI lawmakers before their convictions had attained finality.\n\nBarrister Gohar Ali Khan claimed the PTI also condemned the May 9 violence – in which military installations were also targeted — and asked how long this incident would be used to send lawmakers packing.\n\nBut Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar responded that it was the domain of the courts to pronounce verdicts. “This is a lawful process. Objections can be raised, but the forum to do so is also the court,” he remarked.\n\nHe cited the example of Jamshed Dasti who had been given interim relief by the Lahore High Court following his disqualification by the ECP. He said parliament was not the forum to decide the merits of ongoing prosecutions, adding that the constitutional framework required respect for judicial independence.\n\nAfter proceedings were adjourned, the opposition members exited the house, raising slogans against the convictions and disqualifications. They also staged a protest outside the Parliament House building.\n\nTiff over ordinances\n\nDuring Wednesday’s proceedings, two key lawmakers from the PPP and the PML-N — partners in the ruling coalition — got into an argument over the frequent promulgation of ordinances.\n\nBefore two recently promulgated ordinances were laid before the house for endorsement, PPP leader Syed Naveed Qamar raised objections, saying the unnecessary promulgation of ordinances undermined parliament.\n\nThe objection came as a surprise to some, as his own party leader President Asif Ali Zardari is the one issuing the ordinances.\n\nMr Qamar noted that successive governments had been abusing and misusing the constitutional provision, which allowed the promulgation of ordinances in peculiar circumstances. “This whole process is anti-democratic and against the spirit of the Constitution,” he remarked.\n\nFederal Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain, however, defended the ordinances, saying the process was in line with the Constitution and that no ordinance had unnecessarily been promulgated.\n\nAccording to the minister, the heavens will not fall by the promulgation of ordinances. He said the house and the relevant committees could suggest amendments to the ordinances.\n\nAccording to Article 89 of the Constitution, the president may, except when the Senate or the National Assembly is in session, if satisfied that circumstances exist which render it necessary to take immediate action, make and promulgate an ordinance, as the circumstances may require.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 7th, 2025",
