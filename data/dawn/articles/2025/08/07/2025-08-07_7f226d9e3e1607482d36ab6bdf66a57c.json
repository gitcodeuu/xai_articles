As a result, all the four died on the spot.\n\nRescue 1122 ambulances called to the spot shifted the bodies to Mayo Hospital.\n\nLater, a Lesco statement claimed that the electrocution incident was the result of “negligence” by the shopkeeper who was getting the hoarding fixed without any precaution or informing the staff concerned.
