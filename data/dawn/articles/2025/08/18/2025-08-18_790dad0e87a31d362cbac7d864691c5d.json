Ansari said that Sindh’s fertile and pricey lands were being doled out to local and foreign firms in the name of corporate farming.\n\n“This is sheer injustice to the province and its people,” he said, and stressed that these lands should, instead, be allotted to landless peasant families. This downtrodden segment must also be provided water, electricity, fertiliser and other farm implements so as to ensure their prosperity, he said.\n\nJUI-F District General Secretary Maulana Saleemullah Brohi, Mufti Abdul Shakoor Khoso, Syed Abdul Basit Shah, Abdul Qadir Channa, Maulana Abdul Waheed Brohi, Haji Mohammad Abbas Banglani, Asadullah Haideri, Maulana Taj Mehmood Bhatti, Advocate Anees-ur-Rehman Soomro, Mansoor Ahmed Rind, Mohammad Ilyas Brohi, Mir Hasan Buriro, Maulana Abdul Razzaq Banglani, Irfan Ali Lohar, Maulana Ghulam Haider Pathan and Sanaullah Khoso also spoke.\n\nThey called for immediate measures to restore state’s writ in the dacoit-infested riverine areas of upper Sindh and complete peace in the entire province.\n\nQAT rally in Kandhkot\n\nThe Qaumi Awami Tehreek (QAT) held a rally in Kandhkot to condemn federal government’s corporate farming plan, water scarcity in Sindh and provincial government’s failure in restoring law and order in upper Sindh districts.\n\nQAT workers and supporters led by Sajjad Brohi, Mohammad Sachal Malik and Arsalah marched from Tangwani town’s Larro Road to the local bus stand, where they held a demonstration raising slogans against the government and its ‘anti-Sindh’ projects. The leaders strongly condemn the planned ‘auction’ of Sindh’s land to allot the same to corporate sector for farming. They vowed to resist all such plans tooth and nail.\n\nThey regretted that the province’s farming community was faced with a severe shortage of water despite availability of the commodity in the system. Hundreds of thousands of acres were turning barren, causing a serious concern to farmers, they said, and demanded immediate stops to resolve this major issue.\n\nThe leaders also highlighted the rampant crime in Kandhkot-Kashmore and other districts of upper Sindh, and observed that the law-enforcement agencies had failed to control dacoit gangs, which were continuing to kidnap people for ransom, extorting money from ordinary citizens and honey trapping youths after inviting them to the areas under their control. Such crimes had now become a daily routine, they deplored.\n\nThey demanded decisive action against these gangs to liberate the riverine area from outlaws.\n\nAT protest in K.N. Shah\n\nThe Awami Tehreek (AT) organised a rally in Khairpur Nathen Shah town of Dadu district on Sunday to condemn corporate farming, drawing of six new canals from the Indus River and “grabbing of Sindh’s lands and other resources” under different plans, says a press release.\n\nThe rally started from the town’s community centre and culminated outside the local press club, where the participants held a sit-in, it said.\n\nThe rally was led by AT General Secretary Advocate Sajid Hussain Mahesar along with its Dadu District President Advocate Najeeb Mahesar, Atif Mallah, Hadi Dino Khuhro, Bakht Burriro, Advocate Shabbir Khoso, Advocate Dad Magsi, Rashid Bhurgari and others.\n\nThey alleged that Sindh’s lands were being “auctioned off” under the corporate farming plan while conspiracies were being hatched to separate Karachi from Sindh. They condemned the recent remarks by an FPCCI leader during his press conference in Karachi to support a division of Sindh to create new provinces. “It’s a ploy to spread unrest in Sindh,” they said, adding that people of Sindh would not tolerate such attacks on the historical city of Karachi.\n\nThe leaders also criticised Sindh government for its failure to ensure measures to prevent destruction during monsoon rains and flooding. They alleged that the funds allocated for the repairing and strengthening of Indus embankments and protective bunds had been embezzled by irrigation officials.\n\nThey demanded action against corrupt officials.\n\nThey noted that while Sindh was facing threat of flood, an artificial shortage of water was being created to destroy its crops.\n\nThey also alleged that the PPP government had blocked provision of Sindh’s rightful share in the Indus water.\n\nThe party demanded emergency flood protection measures including strengthening of SM Bund, Prio Bund, Kari Mori Bund and MNV drain dykes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
