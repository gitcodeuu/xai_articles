The nullah where the minor girl was swept away is approximately 5-10 feet deep, with water flowing at a speed of 8-10 kilometers per hour.\n\nIn the second incident, the emergency service staff rescued two herdsmen who were trapped during sudden rise in the rainwater at Adiala road on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, Rescue 1122 Rawalpindi was placed on alert in view of rains in Islamabad and Rawalpindi on Sunday as the leaves of the staff have been cancelled.\n\nThe District Emergency Officer Rawalpindi has imposed Code Red across the district, indicating a high-level alert for potential emergencies. In this context, Code Red typically signifies a serious situation requiring immediate attention and action.\n\nThe rescue services took proactive measures by deploying personnel around Nullah Leh and low-lying areas which are prone to flooding during the rains.\n\nBy keeping rescue teams on duty continuously, they aimed to respond quickly to emergencies and minimise potential risks.\n\nHe said that people should exercise extreme caution during the monsoon season, while parents have been advised not to let their children go near drains and electric poles during the rain.\n\nDuring rain, drive at a slower speed and avoid unnecessary driving, said the spokesman adding that people should move to safer places before urban flooding.\n\nHe further advised not to go under weak and dilapidated roofs during rain and do not visit tourist destinations due to the risk of heavy rains and cloudbursts.\n\nThe emergency service said in its advisory to avoid crossing rivers and in case of any emergency, immediately report to the rescue helpline 1122, he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
