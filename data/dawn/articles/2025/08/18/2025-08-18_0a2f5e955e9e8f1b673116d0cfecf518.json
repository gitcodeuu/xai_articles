Meanwhile, data from the National Disaster Management Authority showed the nationwide toll from rain-related incidents since late-June rose to 660 deaths and 935 injured.\n\nThe KP Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday announced Rs800m in relief funds to the administrations of affected districts on the instructions of the provincial government.\n\nA separate relief fund of Rs500m has been earmarked for Buner district, which accounts for the majority of casualties with 222 deaths and 120 injuries, according to a PDMA report released today.\n\nBuner was followed by Shangla, with 36 deaths and 21 people injured in flash floods and roof collapses since August 15. At least 95 houses have been damaged— 55 fully — with as many schools partially destroyed in Shangla.\n\nMansehra and Bajaur recorded 21 deaths each and five injuries each. Swat reported 20 deaths and two injuries, but witnessed the heaviest damage to infrastructure as 220 houses have been either fully or partially damaged and 163 cattle have perished.\n\nFive people died and three people were injured in Lower Dir due to flash floods and thunder strikes, while 100 cattle perished. Three people died in Battagram due to flash floods, while a roof collapse in Nowshera killed two people.\n\nA cloudburst over two villages in Swabi’s Gadoon Amazai area killed at least 11 people, including children and women and left over 33 missing before dawn.\n\nProvincial Irrigation Minister Aqibullah Khan visited the affected village of Dalori and told Dawn.com that eight bodies were recovered at the disaster site by residents.\n\n“We are close to recovering eight more [bodies],” he said. “Among the dead, 14 people belonged to a single family.”\n\nSwabi Deputy Commissioner Nasrullah Khan confirmed to Dawn.com that 12 houses were inundated in Dalori due to the cloudburst, killing several people.\n\n“The flow of flash floods caused by the cloudburst was very fast, and due to the mountainous area, landslides have also occurred at various places,” he stated.\n\n“The cloudburst and landslides wreaked havoc everywhere in the Gadoon Amazai belt. Many houses were submerged by flash floods, while many people were swept away.”\n\nAmjad Gul, a member of the local forum United Gadoon, told Dawn.com that the cloudburst caused many houses to collapse. Nine people were pulled out of the houses, while the rest remained under the debris.\n\n“It is not an easy task to pull people out of the rubble in Dalori,” Gul said. “There is a dire need for an excavator. It seems that many people have been buried under the rubble.”\n\nHe added that due to the terrain, landslides have been reported in various places, while rescue teams have also been called from the Haripur and Mardan districts.\n\n“Medicines, camps, everything is ready in the hospital,” Gul stated. “People have volunteered to help the affected people and the chief minister and chief secretary are monitoring the situation themselves.”\n\nMeanwhile, in another cloudburst, nine members of the same family were buried under debris in the village of Sar Koi Payan, also a part of the Gadoon Amazai belt.\n\nGul told Dawn.com that the nine people were recovered, but four were killed in the collapse. Among the four dead were two women and two children.\n\n“The family returned from Karachi and were sitting in their newly built house, which suddenly collapsed and buried the entire family under debris,” he said.\n\nLocals recovered the bodies and transported them to Tehsil Headquarters Hospital in Topi.\n\nAll schools were ordered closed in Murree on Tuesday and Wednesday due to “stormy rainy weather conditions”, according to a notification by the Murree District Education Authority.\n\n“There is a risk of heavy rain and landslides in Murree,” Punjab PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia was quoted as saying in a statement.\n\nThe PDMA said about 74mm of rain was recorded in Murree this morning, with more rain predicted in Rawalpindi, Murree, Jhelum, Chakwal and Attock in the next 2 days.\n\nGiven the possible threat of stormy rains and cloud bursts, all resources were being used to protect the citizens, the statement added.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, Mianwali received 85mm of rain, while Chakwal received 76mm, Dera Ghazi Khan 62mm, Jhelum 45mm, Narowal 42mm, Bhakkar 38mm and rainfall of up to 35 mm was recorded in Mangla.\n\nIn Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s Rawalakot, 43mm of rain was recorded in the morning between 8 and 11am, while 31mm of rain was recorded in Punjab’s Attock.\n\nThe Punjab PDMA said the flow of water in the province’s rivers was also continuously increasing due to monsoon rains.\n\nIn the Indus River, there is a medium flood situation at Kalabagh, Chashma and Taunsa, according to the PMD’s Flood Forecasting Division.\n\nIn the Sutlej River, there was a low-level flood at Ganda Singh Wala and Sulemanki, according to the PDMA, while at the Ravi River, there was a low-level flood at Jasar.\n\nThere was a moderate flood situation in Palkho.\n\nThe PDMA said there was a possibility of a further increase in the flow of rivers due to rain in the upper areas, adding that citizens in the river basins should immediately move to safer places.\n\n“Pakistan has been affected by climate change, more rains are being received than usual,” the DG PDMA said in a media talk.\n\nA detailed report from the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA) on casualties and property damage caused by floods from June 28 to today highlighted that 45 people died and 42 were injured so far.\n\nAccording to the report, 19 people died in Diamer, 12 in Ghizer, 10 in Gilgit, two in Kharmang and one each in Astore and Shigar. The report stated that the dead include 25 men, 11 women and nine children.\n\nThe GBDMA highlighted that 993 houses were damaged across the province, with 674 houses being partially damaged. Separately, 87 bridges were washed away in the flood across the region.\n\nMeanwhile, the report highlighted that the roads of Shamshal and Chaporsan in the valleys of Hunza were closed, as was the Baltistan Highway in Ustak, the Ghizer-Chitral Road in Khalti-Ghizer and Hunza Road in Hassanabad. Similarly, several roads were closed in Shigar and Ganchhe.\n\nA young Karachi couple on holiday and two locals were killed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, officials said.\n\nIn the upper belt of Neelum Valley, a vehicle carrying tourists from Karachi skidded off a rain-slicked road and crashed onto the rocky bank of the Neelum River around 1pm. Deputy Commissioner (DC) Nadeem Ahmed Janjua said the rented Pajero jeep was returning from Taobutt, the valley’s last picturesque village, when it met the accident near Shundaas, after covering a distance of 12 kilometres.\n\nThe victims were identified as Zeeshan Shahid, 38, son of Shahid Kareem, and his wife Anmol Haroon, 32, residents of Gulshan-i-Iqbal in Karachi, along with driver Farooq, 35, son of Shabbir, and helper Atif, son of Hakeem, both residents of Phulawai village.\n\nAnmol and the two locals died on the spot, while Zeeshan succumbed to injuries en route to the hospital. The couple’s two-year-old daughter escaped unhurt.\n\nThe Karachi couple had travelled to Neelum Valley in their own car, which they left in Kel — about 156 kilometres from Muzaffarabad — before hiring a jeep for the onward 45-kilometre journey to Taobutt on Sunday.\n\n“It was outpouring today and it is assumed the driver was speeding and lost control of his vehicle on the slippery track,” DC Janjua said, adding that the jeep had plummeted some 250 feet down the gorge.\n\nDistrict Disaster Management Officer Akhtar Ayoub told Dawn.com that the couple’s funeral was held, and their bodies, as well as the child and the car, were being sent to Islamabad to be handed over to the family members arriving there from Karachi.\n\nMeanwhile, tragedy struck Poonch district where Dr Gul-e-Lala, 32, a visiting lecturer in plant pathology at the University of Poonch, Rawalakot, was killed after her car was swept away by a rain-swollen stream. According to Registrar Dr Abdul Rauf, Dr Lala had left the agriculture faculty at the Shamsabad campus around 10am after delivering a one-hour class and was heading home via Hajira Road.\n\nHe said that as per eyewitnesses, she was advised to turn back because a torrent was flowing across the road, whereupon she opted for an alternative route via the Trar campus on the outskirts of Rawalakot.\n\nHowever, the accident occurred while attempting to cross a culvert where water from an otherwise small stream was rushing over the road. He said she had not heard warnings of bystanders and drove into the water, whereupon the car was caught by the gushing current.\n\nThe registrar added that the vehicle was dragged about 150 feet downstream before it was halted by trees and bushes. Onlookers and faculty members, who had rushed alongside, managed to pull her out, but she had already died.\n\nThe death sparked criticism online, with citizens questioning the decision to keep schools and colleges open despite warnings of extreme weather. The AJK government subsequently announced the closure of all elementary and secondary schools from Tuesday to Saturday. In Poonch and some other districts, higher education institutions were also ordered shut on Tuesday.\n\nSeparately, a cloudburst-triggered flood in a water channel in Dhaman Pakhonar village of Sudhnoti district washed away four houses, two suspension bridges and one RCC bridge, according to Deputy Commissioner Mumtaz Kazmi.\n\nFortunately, there were no casualties as the residents had already vacated their homes, but they were unable to save any belongings, he added.\n\nThe deputy commissioner said the road leading to the village had also been destroyed at several points, but machinery would be deployed to reopen it.\n\nPM Shehbaz pledged the federal government’s complete support for flood-hit communities in KP, announcing the donation of one month’s salary from the federal cabinet to aid relief efforts, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\nChairing a meeting to review ongoing relief efforts by the federal government in KP, GB and AJK, the prime minister directed federal institutions to intensify efforts to assist citizens in affected districts. The meeting was attended by federal ministers, the NDMA chief and the PM’s chief coordinator.\n\n“In this hour of calamity, there is no federal or provincial government; we must ensure the assistance and rehabilitation of affected people,” PM Shehbaz said. “Helping our distressed Pakistani brothers and sisters is our national responsibility”.\n\nThe PM added that this was “not a time for politics but for service and healing the wounds of the people”.\n\nThe federal government was ordered to provide financial assistance to the families of deceased and affected individuals under the Prime Minister’s relief package.\n\n“Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam will oversee relief and rehabilitation operations in affected areas, while the relevant federal ministers will personally monitor the restoration of electricity, water, roads, and other facilities in affected areas,” the prime minister added.\n\nThe PM also instructed all relevant federal ministers to visit the northern areas in person and discouraged the National Highway Authority (NHA) from differentiating between provincial or national highways, stating that opening routes for relief must be the top priority.\n\nHe also ordered the communications ministry, NHA, and Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) to repair highways and bridges in affected areas. “[The] minister for communications should personally oversee rehabilitation operations,” the PM ordered.\n\nAdditionally, the minister for power was tasked with visiting affected areas and inspecting and prioritising restoration of the electricity system.\n\n“The NDMA should present a comprehensive plan for the distribution of relief items to flood victims in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” the prime minister said, instructing the finance ministry to provide the necessary resources to the authority.\n\nThe relevant federal ministers were directed to remain in affected areas “until the last person received assistance and basic infrastructure was restored”.\n\n“[The] ministry of health should send medicines and medical teams to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and establish medical camps, while [the] Benazir Income Support Programme should be mobilised to assist the affected,” the prime minister ordered.\n\nParticipants in the meeting were briefed on the ongoing relief activities by the NDMA and federal ministers. They were informed that the federal government, provincial governments, the Pakistan Army and other institutions had established 456 relief camps and conducted 400 rescue operations so far.\n\nThe meeting was briefed that relief trucks carrying essential items were being dispatched, while the prime minister ordered that convoys be sent to the hardest-hit areas.\n\nAccording to the preliminary estimates, damages to public and private property exceeded around Rs126 million.\n\nMeanwhile, the NDMA presented a report on the provision of rations, tents, medicines, medical teams and other essential items, with the prime minister ordering that more relief goods be dispatched.\n\nThe meeting’s participants were informed that the monsoon season would continue until the second week of September, with two major spells of rain expected and six having already passed.\n\nMuqam briefed the meeting on the situation in Swat, while Power Minister Awais Leghari delivered a briefing on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Special Assistant to the PM Mubarak Zeb briefed the meeting on Bajaur, while the NHA chairman reported on Malakand and the communications secretary briefed the meeting on the situation in Gilgit.\n\nInformation Minister Attaullah Tarar said that rescue, relief and restoration of flood-affected areas was a “national obligation”, assuring that the federal and provincial governments would work collectively to fulfil this responsibility.\n\nDuring a media briefing alongside Climate Change Minister Musaddiq Malik and NDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider in Islamabad, Tarar said an important meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif today on the recent flooding caused by monsoon rains.\n\nTarar said ongoing rescue and relief activities in flood hit areas was discussed in the meeting and improved coordination was ongoing with provincial governments.\n\nHe noted that several meetings were held at the National Command and Control Center before the monsoon rains hit, with representatives of all provincial governments participating.\n\n“Data has been regularly provided by the NDMA to the relevant authorities through the Early Warning System,” Tarar said.\n\nHe added that relief activities were being carried out by the armed forces and other organisations in flood-affected areas across KP, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nThe communications secretary was already in GB to supervise restoration of the Skardu-Gilgit Road, Tarar said, while the National Highway Authority chairman was in Malakand Division leading efforts to restore roads.\n\nSimilarly, Tarar said, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit Baltistan Amir Muqam was also in Buner monitoring rescue and relief work.\n\n“The prime minister has instructed the ministers for water, power and communications to ensure their presence in these areas to personally monitoring restoration work of infrastructure related to their respective ministries,” he said.\n\nDuring today’s briefing, NDMA chairman Haider warned that monsoon conditions would remain precarious until the end of August, with normalisation expected by late September.\n\nHe warned that the country remains at risk of further torrential downpours, with two to three additional spells likely in the coming weeks.\n\n“The last spells will end by Sept 10, and the overall situation is expected to normalise by the end of September,” he said.\n\nHe added that search operations are underway for missing people, who would be added to the official death toll if not found.\n\n“More than 425 relief camps have been set up in flood-hit areas, offering essential supplies and medical care,” Haider said. “Displaced families are also being accommodated in government buildings, including schools.”\n\nFood distribution under the Prime Ministers Ration Programme is ongoing, in coordination with provincial governments and relevant authorities, he added.\n\nThe NDMA chairman said that special army units have been deployed on the directions of the Chief of Army Staff (COAS), with critically injured individuals were being airlifted to hospitals.\n\n“Field ambulances are actively transporting patients, and major hospitals are fully engaged,” he said, adding that the National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) remains on high alert and is continuously releasing multi-source data to support relief efforts.\n\n“Pakistan Army Aviation bases have activated reserve systems to support emergency evacuations during the ongoing monsoon emergency.”\n\nSindh Minister for Local Government, Housing and Town Planning Saeed Ghani condoled with the victims of the KP floods, adding that the Sindh government had offered to send aid to KP.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Karachi, he acknowledged that the toll was a “huge number”, with many people still missing. “The nation has shown solidarity with the people of KP, GB, Kashmir,” the minister said.\n\n“The Sindh government has even sent aid, but I heard that the government said this morning that they do not require any,” he added. “I thought this was unreasonable. There is a practical and moral need for aid and for the country to show unity.”\n\nGhani stated that the Sindh government “sent some items” and would not hold back if anything else was needed.\n\n“We have faced such crises in the past. Sometimes, incidents happen that even the provincial and federal governments cannot tackle together,” he said.\n\n“International organisations have come forward and helped us, such as the UN, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\n\n“These are threats that will not go away, despite our efforts,” Ghani said.",
