  "content": "White House trade adviser Peter Navarro on Monday said India’s purchases of Russian crude were funding Moscow’s war in Ukraine and had to stop.\n\nNew Delhi was “now cosying up to both Russia and China”, Navarro wrote in an opinion piece published in the Financial Times today.\n\n“If India wants to be treated as a strategic partner of the United States, it needs to start acting like one.”\n\nIndia’s Foreign Ministry has previously said the country is being unfairly singled out for buying Russian oil while the US and European Union continue to purchase goods from Russia.\n\nUS President Donald Trump announced an additional 25 per cent tariff on Indian goods earlier this month, citing New Delhi’s continued purchases of Russian oil. The move will take total tariffs on imports from India to 50pc.\n\n“India acts as a global clearinghouse for Russian oil, converting embargoed crude into high-value exports while giving Moscow the dollars it needs,” Navarro wrote.\n\nThe adviser also said India’s close ties with Russia and China made it risky to transfer cutting-edge US military capabilities to India.\n\nSeparately, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s top refiner, will continue to buy Russian oil depending on economics, the company’s head of finance Anuj Jain told an analyst meeting today.\n\nJain said his company’s Russian oil processing in the June quarter was about 24pc compared to an average 22pc in 2024/25.\n\nHe said purchases for the September quarter were continuing and the discounts on Russian oil were in the range of $1.50 per barrel to the Dubai benchmark.\n\nLongtime rivals China and India are quietly and cautiously strengthening ties against the backdrop of Trump’s unpredictable approach to both.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to meet Chinese President Xi Jinping at the end of the month, while Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi will visit India from Monday for talks on the disputed border between the two countries.\n\nA planned visit by US trade negotiators to New Delhi from August 25-29 has been called off, a source said over the weekend, delaying talks on a proposed trade agreement and dashing hopes of relief from additional US tariffs on Indian goods from August 27.",
