  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Sunday reiterated its demand for an empowered judicial commission to probe all national tragedies since the country’s inception, including the May 9 and November 26 incidents.\n\nThe party repeated its demand in light of an article published in Jang newspaper, detailing a meeting between the author and the army chief in Brussels. The author claimed that the army chief had linked “political reconciliation to sincere apology”.\n\nPTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram, in a statement, said the matter of a so-called ‘sincere apology’ was part of a private discussion with a journalist, reiterating that the party and its leadership had consistently demanded an impartial probe into the matter.\n\nHe alleged that the issue of apology was being deliberately recycled in the media to distract the nation from the grave crises it faced today and to protect those who looted Pakistan’s wealth and trampled the Constitution.\n\nHe reiterated the party’s demand for an empowered judicial commission, comprising judges of unquestionable integrity, to probe all national tragedies, from the Fall of Dhaka to the May 9 violence to the theft of mandate on Feb 8. The PTI leader said that every individual guilty of these crimes against the nation must be brought to justice without exception, regardless of rank, office, or influence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
