Temperatures are expected to reach up to 45 degrees Celsius (113 Fahrenheit) in some areas on Sunday, Spanish national weather agency AEMET said.\n\n“There are still some challenging days ahead and, unfortunately, the weather is not on our side,” Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told a news conference in Ourense, one of the most affected areas.\n\nHe announced an increase in military reinforcements, bringing the total number of troops deployed across Spain to 1,900. Virginia Barcones, director general of emergency services, told Spanish public TV temperatures were expected to drop from Tuesday, but for now the weather conditions were “very adverse”.\n\n“Today there are extremely high temperatures with an extreme risk of fires, which complicates the firefighting efforts,” Barcones said.\n\nVillagers resort to buckets\n\nIn the village of Villardevos in Galicia, desperate neighbours have organised to fight the flames on their own with water buckets as the area was left without electricity to power water pumps.\n\n“The fireplanes come in from all sides, but they don’t come here,” Basilio Rodriguez, a resident, said on Saturday. Added Lorea Pascual, another local resident: “It’s insurmountable, it couldn’t be worse”.\n\nInterior ministry data show 27 people have been arrested and 92 were under investigation for suspected arson since June. In neighbouring Portugal, wildfires have burnt some 155,000 hectares of vegetation so far this year, according to provisional data from the ICNF forestry protection institute — three times the average for this period between 2006 to 2024. About half of that area burned just in the past three days.\n\nThousands of firefighters were battling eight large blazes in central and northern Portugal, the largest of them near Piodao, a scenic, mountainous area popular with tourists.\n\nAnother blaze in Trancoso, further north, has now been raging for eight days. A smaller fire a few miles east claimed a local resident’s life on Friday — the first this season.\n\n‘Climate pact’\n\nSpanish leader Pedro Sanchez promised on Sunday a “national pact” to deal with the climate emergency, as he visited a western region battling devastating wildfires. France and Italy had earlier sent water bombers to an air base near Salamanca to help with the firefighting efforts.\n\n“The government of Spain will work now so that in September we can have the bases of this national pact to mitigate and adapt to the climate emergency,” said Prime Minister Sanchez during a visit to Ourense in the northwestern province of Galicia.\n\nHe said he wanted to do “everything possible and even more” to ensure victims of the fires returned to a normal life. The northwest and west of the country have been hard-hit by the fires, particularly the regions of Castile and Leon, Galicia, Asturias and Extremadura.\n\nSpain is expected to remain on heat alert until Monday, with the extreme temperatures having significantly increased the risk of wildfires.\n\nClimate change caused by humans is increasing the intensity, duration and frequency of periods of extreme heat, which fuel forest fires.—\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
