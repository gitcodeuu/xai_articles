  "content": "KARACHI: Around 50 per cent of people suffering from diabetic foot ulcers in Pakistan develop depression, while those who lose their limbs to the disease often sink into severe mental illness and even suicidal thoughts, experts said at the concluding session of an international conference held on Sunday at a local hotel.\n\nThe conference — Diabetes and Diabetic Foot 2025 — was jointly organised by the Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology (BIDE), Baqai Medical University and Diabetic Foot International.\n\nThe scientific session featured a series of presentations by local and international experts, who highlighted findings from their studies and shared strategies for managing diabetes and its devastating complications.\n\nProf Najmul Islam, senior endocrinologist at the Aga Khan University, said depression was very common among diabetics, as in other chronic illnesses.\n\n“Suicidal thoughts are a manifestation of severe depr­e­ssion and often emerge in patients with serious complications,” he explained.\n\nOn the use of new medications for Type 2 diabetes and obesity, he noted that Pakistani patients required safe and cost-effective versions given the high cost of drugs.\n\nDr G. Abbas from Tanzania highlighted the psychological trauma faced by patients at risk of losing limbs. “Even the loss of a toe is unacceptable to many in sub-Saharan Africa,” he said, stressing that counselling was essential to help patients accept treatment.\n\nDirector BIDE Dr Zahid Miyan said that half of those with diabetic foot ulcers suffered from depression, which became far more severe following amputation.\n\nHe emphasised the need to classify diabetic foot ulcers into categories and design separate management plans for each type of wound to improve outcomes.\n\nSenior endocrinologist Prof Tariq Waseem said that even the diagnosis of diabetes could trigger depression, while long-term complications such as neuropathy fuelled chronic psychological distress.\n\n“Many patients complain of suicidal thoughts. It’s important that doctors counsel their patients well, and reassure them that diabetes is not a death warrant. With medication and proper counselling, patients can not only live a normal life but even reverse their condition.”\n\nFindings from a 2023 study carried out in Karachi’s slums were also shared at the conference, showing that 30.8pc of diabetics were clinically depressed, 20.4pc had suicidal ideation, and over 11pc had attempted suicide.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
