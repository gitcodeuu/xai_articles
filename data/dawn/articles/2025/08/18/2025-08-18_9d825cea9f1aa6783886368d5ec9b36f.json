  "content": "QUETTA: A two-member bench of the Balochistan High Court has ordered the deputy commissioner of Quetta to take over the community tube-wells in Hazara Town and ensure smooth and regular drinking water supply to all residents of the area.\n\nThe BHC bench comprising Justice Muhammad Kamran Mullahkhail and Justice Gul Hassan Tareen heard the petition filed by a resident of the Hazara Town, Qurban Ali, in the high court against the secretary of Water and Sanitation Authority (Wasa) and others pleading that the people of the area were not receiving smooth water supply from the community tube-wells.\n\nThe petitioner complained that despite repeated court orders, political groups and private individuals were creating obstacles to water distribution, depriving many residents while favouring their own supporters.\n\nThe court observed that Wasa had failed to meet its responsibilities despite the presence of several tube-wells in the area. It instructed the deputy commissioner to coordinate with Wasa and the Public Health Engineering Department to establish the proper supply system, conduct a survey, and form new resident committees to oversee the operation of tube-wells.\n\nThe case was adjourned till Aug 26 with directions for compliance reports to be submitted at the next hearing.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
