  "content": "SWAT: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur on Sunday visited the flood-hit areas of Swat, where he chaired a high-level meeting in Saidu Sharif.\n\nChief secretary Shahab Ali Shah, secretaries of various departments, members of the provincial assembly, and officials of the civil administration were in attendance.\n\nOfficials briefed the chief minister on the losses caused by recent floods across Swat and Malakand division.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the meeting, CM Gandapur said the loss of human lives was the greatest tragedy, which could never be compensated, but assured that financial and material damage would be fully addressed.\n\n“The government will not abandon the affected families. Whatever losses people have suffered will be compensated,” he said, adding that restoring public trust in government commitments was crucial, since broken promises in the past had eroded that trust.\n\nThe chief minister stressed that the provincial government was committed to delivering justice to all citizens, stating: “The state will play the role of a mother and give everyone their due rights.”\n\nMr Gandapur announced that a survey had been launched in vulnerable areas to introduce advanced technology aimed at reducing the risk of mudslides and stone-laden floods. The technology, already in use in countries like Switzerland and India, would now be implemented in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nHe said reconstruction of damaged houses would be carried out by the government, but only in safe locations to avoid repeat losses. He also pointed to encroachments as a major factor behind flood devastation. “Encroachments have existed for years, and despite operations, stay orders from courts worsened the situation,” he said, urging people to refrain from new encroachments and to show patience.\n\nThe CM vowed that encroachments would be removed without discrimination, citing the example of Dera Ismail Khan, where a similar operation was successfully conducted. “With the cooperation of the public and political parties, the same process will be extended to Swat and the rest of the province,” he added.\n\nMr Gandapur further announced the restoration of electricity networks, hospitals, and roads damaged in the floods, assuring that both human and financial losses would be compensated in full. “This is the right of the people, not a favour,” he said, while also calling upon the federal government to extend support. He appreciated the condolence messages and assurances received from the prime minister and other senior federal officials.\n\nHighlighting the province’s financial stability, the chief minister said the KP government was no longer weak. “There was a time when we did not even have resources to pay one month’s salaries. Today, the situation has changed,” he remarked. He revealed that after assuming office, the provincial government established an endowment fund that has now grown to Rs190 billion, generating a daily income of Rs850 million.\n\n“We have sufficient resources and do not need foreign aid. The government will rehabilitate flood victims and compensate damage from its own funds,” he declared.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
