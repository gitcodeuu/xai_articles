The NHA, however, did not provide documents to these committees to contest allegations against it.\n\nThe Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (Carec) Tranche-III project is worth Rs170 billion and has invited parliamentary scrutiny, particularly due to its award to a firm that had been disqualified by the NHA over two years ago.\n\nDocuments seen by Dawn indicated that one of the firms in the joint venture (JV) was disqualified by the highway authority in 2023 for failing to complete the 62km Lodhran-Multan section, but it was still allowed to submit technical and financial bids for the Tranche-III project.\n\nThe committee maintained that the firm was currently involved in litigation related to the Multan-Lodhran project. It further observed that the Tranche-III contracts were initially awarded based on auditor sheets without verifying the credentials of the firms involved.\n\nThe standing committees observed that despite violations of Public Procurement Authority (PPRA) rules pointed out by the parliamentary bodies, the NHA chose to keep the award of the contract intact with the controversial JV.\n\nIn the Aug 2 meeting of the Senate EAD committee, the NHA was given a final 15-day deadline to come up with all documents required by the committee, which is expected to give its verdict in the next meeting.\n\nTwo more projects on radar\n\nBesides the Carec project, two other projects in the portfolio of the same JV invited the scrutiny of lawmakers. The panel held a detailed discussion on the Gilgit-Shandur motorway project, noting that there were several irregularities and signs of collusive practices in the project.\n\nReferring to the ‘Hanzol Hydropower Project’, the committee revealed that the work order was issued on May 7, 2024, and the work was completed on May 7, 2025. However, the bid documents for the project were submitted in September 2024, and the same project was included in the audit reports for the financial year 2023–24.\n\nIn its recent report, PPRA endorsed the findings of the standing committees and directed the NHA to provide the relevant documents regarding the financial and technical strength of the joint venture.\n\nAlthough the NHA officials have agreed to provide all the relevant documents to the committee and PPRA, under the relevant rules, the contractors cannot submit any new documents to the NHA that were not part of the bid documents.\n\nIn one of such meetings, the Senate body termed it an open-and-shut case of corruption and directed the NHA to wrap up the whole bidding process and start a new.\n\nThe Central Asian Regional Economic Cooperation Program is an ADB-supported initiative which was created in 1997 to encourage economic cooperation among countries in the Central Asian region. Tranche-I, II and III road projects are underway or have been completed. Tranche-III has four lots as Lot-1 (58km road from Rajanpur to Jampur), Lot-2 (64km from Jampur to DG Khan), Lot-3 (112km from DG Khan to Tibbi Qaisrani), and Lot-4 (96km from Tibbi Qaisrani to DI Khan). Participating countries are Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, China, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Mongolia, Pakistan, Tajikistan, Turkmen­istan, and Uzbekistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
