We will change the plan and set up such schools in flood-affected areas,” he said.\n\nAn official of elementary and secondary education department told Dawn that the infrastructure of government schools was present in each village and neighbourhood council, that’s why education department faced huge losses in natural and manmade disasters.\n\n“Hundreds of government schools had been destroyed in the devastating earthquake in 2005 in Hazara division. Provincial government reconstructed a large number of those schools but still many could not be rebuilt owing to inefficiency of Federal Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (Erra) and Provincial Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority (Perra),” he said.\n\nThe infrastructure of education department was also severely affected during war against terrorism as many government schools were bombed by terrorists. Some schools were also destroyed by the devastating floods in 2010 in the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 18th, 2025",
