Yasir was dismissed after scoring 51 off 35 balls with the aid of five fours and a six. This was his second half-century of the tournament.\n\nLeft-hander Maaz was then joined by Abdul Samad and the pair added 32 runs for the second wicket. Maaz went on to register his maiden century of the tournament, striking 11 fours and two sixes in his 59-ball knock of 104. The 20-year-old batter richly earned the player-of-the-match honours.\n\nShaheens’ total was further boosted by Abdul Samad’s 18-ball 25 which included a four and a six as they amassed 202 for six off the stipulated 20 overs.\n\nFor Strikers, Harry Manenti claimed three wickets for 31 runs in three overs.\n\nIn reply, Strikers lost wickets at regular intervals and were reduced to 49 for five in the eighth over. Opener Mackenzie Harvey top-scored with a 17-ball 27, laced with five boundaries.\n\nFor Shaheens, left-arm spinners Faisal Akram and Mehran Mumtaz bagged two wickets apiece while off-spinner Mubasir Khan grabbed three wickets for 19 in three overs.\n\nShaheens now face Nepal in the event on Friday at the same venue.\n\nScores in brief:\n\nPakistan Shaheens beat Adelaide Strikers by 107 runs.\n\nPAKISTAN SHAHEENS 202-6 in 20 overs (Maaz Sadaqat 104, Yasir Khan 51, Abdul Samad 25; Harry Manenti 3-31); ADELAIDE STRI­KERS 95 in 16.1 overs (Mackenzie Harvey 27; Mubasir Khan 3-19, Faisal Akram 2-19, Mehran Mumtaz 2-20).\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 21st, 2025",
