  "content": "DERA MURAD JAMALI: Armed assailants on motorcycles opened fire near Ghanta Ghar Chowk on Wednesday, killing two men and injuring five bystanders in an attack police said is linked to an old tribal feud.\n\nThe attackers shot and killed Gul Hassan Jamali and Nawab Khan Jamali near the area close to the City Police Station, according to officials.\n\nFive bystanders were wounded in the gunfire. One, identified as Naeem, was critically injured and transferred to a hospital in Larkana for treatment. The identities of the other four injured were not immediately known.\n\nThe incident is believed to be in retaliation for a previous killing connected to a long-running feud between the Buxhlani Jamali and Dashti tribes. A few months earlier, members of the Jamali tribe allegedly killed Shaban Dashti.\n\nEyewitnesses said more than five attackers were involved in Wednesday’s shooting, some on motorcycles and at least one on a pickup vehicle.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 21st, 2025",
