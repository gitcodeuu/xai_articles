Rescue 1122 and other departments briefed him on the ongoing efforts.\n\nDuring his visit, the DC was briefed at flood posts in Bet Ashraf, Banbhan and adjoining areas about the rescue, relief, and flood-control activities and he also met the locals.\n\nHe was informed that relief camps had been set up in government schools, where cooked meals were being provided to displaced families. He was informed that while some low-lying areas had been submerged, most houses remained safe as residents had built them on elevated ground.\n\nThe Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) had said that most rivers and hill torrents were maintaining normal to low flood levels, while Chashma and Taunsa on the Indus were facing medium flood conditions.\n\nIn Bahawalpur, evacuation of civil population from the Dera Baakha and other rural areas of city had been ordered. The decision was taken during a meeting of the disaster management authority chaired by DC Dr Farhan Farooq.\n\nThe decision was taken in view of the alert issued by the PDMA and the increasing water levels in Sutlej following reports of India releasing water in the river. The water was expected to pass through Pakistan Railways’ Empress Bridge near Bahawalpur city within a few days.\n\nThe meeting was informed that rural areas were at risk of flooding. The meeting was told that breaches at two private dykes had submerged vast agriculture land and damaged standing crops.\n\nAssistant commissioners were directed to remain alert and take measures to shift civilian population of at-risk areas to safer places and flood relief camps.\n\nDistrict Emergency Officer (DEO) Baqir Hussain told the meeting that eight advance flood posts had been made functional in four tehsils of the district.\n\nMeanwhile, Vehari was also experiencing a medium level flood in Sutlej.
