Both were produced before the court on Wednesday for remand. The court granted the police three days’ custody of the accused for further investigation.\n\nThe purported crime took place on Friday.\n\nGhulam Akhtar, a resident of Kot Addu, Muzaffargarh District, lodged an FIR stating that his daughter married the suspect of her own choice about 19 years ago and settled with him in Malik Colony, Girja Road, Dhamiyal. The couple had three children who lived with them.\n\nHe said in the FIR that an announcement was made in their native town that the funeral of his daughter would be held at 8am in a local graveyard in Kot Addu.\n\nHe claimed that when he heard the news, he was shocked as neither he nor his family had been informed of his daughter’s death.\n\nHe, along with his brothers Ghulam Rasool and Abdul Rehman, his sister Kalsoom Bibi and his brother’s wife Safia Bibi, went to the suspect’s home.\n\nGhulam Akhtar further said in the FIR that when his sister Kalsoom Bibi saw Samina’s body, she informed him that his daughter had been tortured, as there were multiple marks of violence on her body.\n\nThis was also confirmed by his brother’s wife Safia Bibi, who saw the body.\n\nHe said that shortly afterwards, he contacted the police emergency helpline “15” in Kot Addu and sought help. As soon as he called the police, the suspect and his children started hurling threats of dire consequences at him.\n\nThe Kot Addu police later informed Ghulam Akhtar that since the incident had occurred in the jurisdiction of Dhamiyal police station, Rawalpindi, the concerned police would take legal action on his complaint.\n\nThe deceased’s body was subsequently transported to District Headquarters Hospital (DHQ) Rawalpindi for postmortem.\n\nSuperintendent of Police (SP) Sadar Muhammad Nabil Khokhar said that the arrested persons will be challaned in court with solid evidence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 21st, 2025",
