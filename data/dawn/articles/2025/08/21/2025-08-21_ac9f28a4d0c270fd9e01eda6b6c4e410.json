  "content": "KARACHI: Four workers of the Awami National Party (ANP) were injured and one of them suffered severe burn wounds when a loud explosion caused the collapse of their office in Orangi Town on Wednesday, police and hospital officials said.\n\nWest SSP Tariq Illahi Mastoi told the media that the ANP office was situated in a dilapidated building. The explosion occurred when one of the workers switched on a fan, which likely triggered a blast caused due to gas leakage.\n\nThe Bomb Disposal Squad (BDS) was called in to determine the cause of the explosion. BDS West in-charge Abid Farooq confirmed that the blast was caused by a leakage from an LPG cylinder, which ignited due to an electric spark.\n\nHe added that the two-storey building was completely destroyed in the explosion.\n\nRescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb said the victims were pulled from the rubble and transported to a hospital.\n\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that one of the injured, Latifur Rehman, sustained 84 per cent burn injuries and is in critical condition. The other three victims also suffered injuries, including burns.\n\nCharred body found in sack\n\nThe charred burnt body of a young man was found on Northern Bypass opposite Labour Colony on Wednesday, police said.\n\nGadap City SHO Sarfraz Jatoi said it appeared that the man was set on fire at someplace else and the body, stuffed in a sack, was dumped here.\n\nThe corpse was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities and identification.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 21st, 2025",
