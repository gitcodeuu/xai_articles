It also examined how they interact.\n\nFloating sea ice does not add to sea level when it melts. But its retreat does replace white surfaces that reflect almost all of the Sun’s energy back into space with deep blue water, which absorbs the same amount instead. Ninety percent of the heat generated by manmade global warming is soaked up by oceans.\n\nRetreating sea ice\n\nAfter increasing slightly during the first 35 years that satellite data was available, Antarctic sea ice cover plunged dramatically over the last decade. Since 2014, sea ice has retreated on average 120 kilometres (75 miles) from the continent’s shoreline. That contraction has happened about three times faster in 10 years than the decline in Arctic sea ice over nearly 50.\n\nThe “overwhelming evidence of a regime shift in sea ice” means that, on current trends, Antar­ctica could essentially become ice free in summer sooner than the Arctic, the study found. This will speed up warming in the region and beyond, and could push some marine species toward extinction.\n\nOver the last two years, for example, helpless emperor penguin chicks perished at multiple breeding grounds, drowning or freezing to death when sea ice gave way earlier than usual under their tiny feet.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 21st, 2025",
