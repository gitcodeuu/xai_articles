  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Senior PML-N leader and president of Pakistan ex-servicemen society retired Lt Gen Abdul Qayyum has noted that the slow pace of work on the second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a cause for concern, but said that ties with United States have been repaired without compromising their commitments to China.\n\n“It is true, the pace of CPEC Phase-II is slower than it should be, and that is a cause for concern. CPEC is not just a bilateral project between Pakistan and China; it is the flagship of the Belt and Road Initiative and a symbol of our ironclad strategic partnership with Beijing,” he said in an interview with Huashang Weekly.\n\nHe said Phase-II was particularly crucial because it focuses on industrial cooperation, Special Economic Zones (SEZs), agricultural modernisation, information technology, and energy diversification.\n\nHe said the ML-1, the Main Line railway upgrade, was the backbone of Pakistan’s connectivity and its timely completion will transform freight movement and regional trade. “Delays here send the wrong signal to investors and partners,” he observed.\n\nSays ties with US repaired without compromise on commitments to China\n\nHe said when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visits China for the SCO meeting, his sideline discussion with President Xi Jinping will be critical. All bottlenecks, whether bureaucratic, political, or financial, must be addressed. “We need to send a clear message that Pakistan is fully committed to CPEC’s timelines and that this project remains above political divisions,” he said.\n\nMoreover, he said, the private sector should be actively involved in SEZ development, cooperation in renewable energy should be expanded and CPEC should be linked with Gwadar’s port potential to open new export markets in Africa and the Middle East.\n\n“Remember, CPEC is not just an economic project; it is a strategic lifeline that strengthens Pakistan’s sovereignty, economic resilience, and regional standing. Beyond its economic and infrastructural benefits, CPEC is also a story of strategic trust between Pakistan and China — a trust that has been tested and proven over decades.\n\n“When I speak to Chinese counterparts, they often emphasise that Pakistan is not just a participant in the Belt and Road Initiative; it is its beating heart.”\n\nHe said the success of CPEC was seen in Beijing as proof that the BRI can deliver tangible benefits, even in complex political and security environments.\n\nFor Pakistan, this trust translates into opportunities far beyond roads and power plants. It opens the door for technology transfer, joint ventures in defence production, cooperation in renewable energy, and agricultural innovation to tackle food security challenges.\n\nHe said Pakistan’s relations with China, an all-weather friend, remain as strong as ever. “We have succeeded in repairing relations with the United States, despite their earlier displeasure over CPEC. Importantly, we have done this without making any compromise on our national interests or our commitments to China.\n\nThe Americans have now realised that India, which they were trying to use as a proxy to contain China, is in fact a weak link. They have discovered that India’s claims do not match its actual potential. So, now they see Pakistan again as a credible, balancing player in South Asia.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 21st, 2025",
