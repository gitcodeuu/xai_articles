With PRISM+, Pakistan joins a select group of countries adopting the ISO 20022 global messaging standard for both retail and large-value payment systems.\n\nBuilt on advanced standards, PRISM+ offers enhanced functionality, including structured financial messaging, improved interoperability, and greater transparency.\n\nThe system also introduces innovative features such as real-time liquidity management, transaction queuing and prioritisation, future-dated payments, and seamless integration with the Central Securities Depository (CSD) for auctions, repos, and monetary operations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 21st, 2025",
