Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform. “That will make it very hard for us to make a Trade Deal with them.”\n\nAsked by reporters if there was a scenario where Canada could change its position before the UN meeting, Carney said: “There’s a scenario (but) possibly one that I can’t imagine.”\n\nCanada’s intention “is predicated on the Palestinian Authority’s commitment to much-needed reforms,” Carney said, referring to the body led by President Mahmoud Abbas, which has civil authority in parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, Portugal Prime Minister Montenegro’s office said in a statement that the country “is considering recognition of the Palestinian state, as part of a procedure that could be concluded during the high-level week of the 80th United Nations General Assembly, to be held in New York in September”,\n\nUS envoy to enter Gaza\n\nSeparately, Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff held talks in Israel on Thursday on ways to end the crisis in Gaza, where nearly 22 months of grinding war and dire shortages of food have drawn mounting international criticism.\n\nWitkoff, who has been involved in months of stalled negotiations for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, met Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shortly after his arrival, the Israeli leader’s office said.\n\nWitkoff and ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee will also enter Gaza on Friday (today) to inspect aid distribution and meet with residents of the war-wracked territory.\n\nSanctions on Palestinian Authority\n\nThe US imposed sanctions on Pales­tinian Authority officials and members of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO) on Thursday, accusing them of undermining peace efforts with Israel.\n\nThe State Department said it would deny visas for travel to the US by those it was targeting, although it did not name any specific individuals.\n\nThe PA and PLO serve as representatives for the Palestinian people and have long pushed for recognition of a Palestinian state by international organisations and foreign nations. The two groups had no immediate comment on the US move.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 1st, 2025",
