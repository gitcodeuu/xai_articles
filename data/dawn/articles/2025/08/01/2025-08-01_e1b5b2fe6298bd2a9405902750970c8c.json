  "content": "LAHORE: In response to higher-than-usual rainfall in the cotton-growing belt, the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) has announced the immediate implementation of a new moisture policy, effective from Aug 1.\n\nAccording to a letter issued by PCGA General Secretary Zikrullah Khalidi on Thursday, ginners will pay the full rate for cotton containing up to 10pc moisture, without any deduction in weight.\n\nHowever, deductions will apply for higher moisture levels, and produce with more than 40pc moisture will be rejected outright.\n\nAs per the new policy, a deduction of 1kg will be applied for cotton with 10-20pc moisture, 2kg for 21-30pc and 3kg for 31-40pc.\n\nIf the moisture falls between 11pc and 40pc but doesn’t fit within these specific bands, a standard allowance of 100 grams will be deducted.\n\nCotton exceeding 40pc moisture content will be refused, though growers may resubmit the dried produce within 24 to 48 hours.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 1st, 2025",
