Thus, the case was disposed of as ‘A’ Class (untraced) by Investigation DSP Clifton division Jahanzaib Khan,” the DIG told Dawn.com.\n\nRegarding the second incident, which occurred in 2024, the DIG said that the complainant, another advocate, filed an FIR alleging that while heading for Isha prayers with Khawaja Shamsul Islam in Zamzama neighbourhood of Karachi, they were “ambushed by the complainant in the first case along with 15-20 armed accomplices”.\n\n“The attackers used firearms, iron rods and sticks, injuring Khawaja Shamsul Islam,” he alleged, adding that the attackers had gathered outside the mosque.\n\nDIG Raza pointed out that a preliminary investigation of last year’s attack was conducted by Inspector Maqbool Meher and some suspects were also arrested by the police. However, the case was later transferred to the Special Investigation Unit (SIU)/Crime Investigation Agency (CIA) Karachi as an “extortion matter”.\n\nThe official elaborated that one police security guard had been provided to Islam. “Incidentally, the poilce guard was outside the mosque at the time of the attack. The lawyer and his son were targeted inside the mosque.”\n\nThe DIG added that the private security guards of the mosque have been detained for questioning.\n\nThe body of the slain lawyer was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for legal formalities. Police surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that the advocate sustained “firearm injury to his chest, damaging vital organs and leading to irreversible hemorrhagic shock”.\n\nThe DIG has constituted a special team under the supervision of the South SSP to arrest the people, who murdered the advocate and injured his son.\n\nThe official said the prime suspect was the son of a police constable deployed for Islam’s security in the past as witnesses heard him saying that he had taken “revenge” for the murder of his father.\n\nIn a statement issued today, the Karachi Bar Association condemned the murder of Islam and announced that its members will not appear before any court on August 2 (Saturday) to express their solidarity with the slain senior laywer.\n\nIn April this year, a judge and a lawyer were shot dead in an armed attack on the motorway in Nowshera district.\n\nNowshera Deputy Commissioner Irfanullah Mehsud told Dawn.com that one of the slain, Mohammad Hayat, was working as a civil judge in Mardan and belonged to the Swat district.\n\n“The other person was identified as Khalid Khan, a lawyer, belonging to Rustam area of Mardan, who was accompanying the judge.”\n\nMehsud said that they died on the spot and the bodies were moved to Qazi Hussain Ahmed Medical Complex.",
