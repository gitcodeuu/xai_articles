  "content": "ISLAMABAD: After almost 36 years of its construction, the historical Faisal Mosque is likely to witness major overhauling and repair work, as the Saudi government has showed its interest in helping the Capital Development Authority in this regard.\n\nIn 1966, King Faisal Abdul Aziz visited Islamabad and an international competition was held for the selection of the mosque’s design, which was won by Turkish architect Vedat Dalokay. In 1976, its foundation stone was laid and the building was completed in 1988. Now, after more than 36 years, the mosque, frequented by worshippers and tourists alike, requires major renovation.\n\nSoon the Saudi government will sign a memorandum of understanding (MoU) in this regard with Ministry of Interior and CDA.\n\nChairman CDA Mohammad Ali Randhawa met Saudi Ambassador Nawaf bin Said Ahmed Al-Malki at CDA headquarters on Thursday. “The meeting held in a very cordial atmosphere in which matters of mutual interest including signing of MOU between CDA regarding Faisal Mosque came under discussion,” read a statement issued by CDA.\n\n“Both sides also explored opportunities for collaboration in hotel industry in Islamabad. The ambassador said potential Saudi investors of leading hotel industry are already coming to Pakistan.”\n\nThe press release said that the chairman CDA highlighted the deep-rooted brotherly relations between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, built on shared faith, friendship and mutual respect. He emphasised the special bond that exists between the people of Pakistan and Saudi Arabia and reiterated CDA’s commitment to further strengthen cooperation and bond with Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe Saudi ambassador appreciated the “excellent performance of CDA for making Islamabad most beautiful, thus evolving urban landscape and horticulture of Islamabad. He also appreciated the efforts of CDA in executing various development projects, as well as improved civic amenities.\n\nHe also appreciated CDA for making state of the art nursery thus making it Gardenia Hub. The two sides also discussed the celebration of National Day of Saudi Arabia on September 23. The chairman CDA assured him of his full support for the smooth facilitation, including necessary arrangements in collaboration with relevant authorities.\n\nHe said Islamabad will always remain welcoming to Saudi investments and cultural exchange.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 1st, 2025",
