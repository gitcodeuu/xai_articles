Nine cases were also registered.\n\n“Action was taken on solid evidence, ensuring that no innocent trader is unfairly targeted. We assure full support to law-abiding traders,” Lahore DC Syed Musa Raza said.\n\nHe urged the citizens to report any issues with sugar availability or overpricing immediately, with direct access to the additional deputy commissioner general for swift resolution. “All efforts are focused on providing relief to the public, with the administration reinforcing that the law applies equally to all.”\n\nThe officer claimed that these measures had stabilised sugar prices and availability, directly benefiting Lahorites by ensuring a steady and affordable supply of this essential sugar.\n\nSAND EXCAVATION: A team of Ravi Urban Development Authority (RUDA) on Thursday got five people booked for unlawfully excavating sand.
