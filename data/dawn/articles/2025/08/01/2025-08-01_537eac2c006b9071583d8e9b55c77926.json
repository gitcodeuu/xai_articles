  "content": "ISLAMABAD: After India reportedly used his remarks to build its case against Pakistan in the Financial Action Task Force, KP CM Ali Amin Gandapur said his statement was taken out of context and vowed to “expose” New Delhi’s role in fomenting terrorism in the country.\n\nEarlier this week, CM Gandapur had claimed that the provincial government arrested militants but the intelligence agencies would get them released, saying they were their ‘own people’. India reportedly used his remarks to submit a formal complaint to FATF – a global anti-terror financing watchdog.\n\nResponding in a late-night video message, the CM said India was involved in terrorism in Pakistan, including KP, adding that he would write a letter to the watchdog to clarify his stance. He said he would also “physically” go to the global organisation to make a case against India and get it added to the “grey list” for sponsoring terrorism.\n\nHe claimed India had used Afghanistan as a launchpad to fund terrorism in Pakistan and also blamed New Delhi for the recent terror wave across the country. He said the nation as well as the security forces were united for the defence of Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 1st, 2025",
