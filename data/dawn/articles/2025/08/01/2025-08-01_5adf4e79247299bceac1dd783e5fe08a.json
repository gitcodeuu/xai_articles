It may be recalled that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif last visited Iran on May 26, 2025. The visit is expected to further strengthen the brotherly relations between Pakistan and Iran,” the FO said.\n\nPakistan has recently expressed solidarity and a desire for cooperation with Iran, which experts say is vital to securing shared interests in a shifting geopolitical environment.\n\nPezeshkian will be the second Iranian president to visit Pakistan in as many years. The visit was initially planned for the last week of July.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar previously said that President Pezeshkian would “soon” make an official visit to Islamabad, according to IRNA.\n\nSpeaking in an interview on the sidelines of his visit to New York, FM Dar had said Pezeshkian was scheduled to visit Pakistan and expressed hope the trip would take place in early August. “Pakistan supports diplomacy and a wise approach in the region and welcomes all efforts toward de-escalation and dialogue with Iran,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nPM Shehbaz visited Iran on May 26 as part of his regional tour to friendly countries aimed at expre­ssing gratitude for their support during the conflict with India. He met Iranian leaders, including Pezeshkian, to strengthen ties and deepen regional cooperation.\n\nHe had previously visited Iran in May 2024 to attend the memorial ceremony of former president Raisi and met Iran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.",
