Most of the passengers suffered scratches, bruises and skin injuries.”\n\nOn July 28, three coaches of the Jaffar Express train were derailed near Shikarpur following an explosion on the tracks, leaving one person injured.\n\nSukkur Railways Divisional Superintendent Jamshaid Alam said that the Jaffar Express was travelling from Peshawar to Quetta when it was caught in the explosion near Sultanpur.\n\n“Following the blast, train operations have been suspended,” Alam said, adding that passengers “faced serious difficulties due to the train’s derailment”.\n\nThe Associated Press of Pakistan reported that Railways Minister Muhammad Hanif Abbasi took notice of the derailment and directed the Railways CEO and the divisional superintendent to reach the scene and oversee the situation.\n\nThe minister also ordered a detailed inquiry into the accident and instructed that a report be submitted within seven days.\n\nOn July 29, the Ministry of Railways said that the train was derailed due to a technical fault and not an explosion, adding that local residents thought the sound of the derailed train was an explosion.\n\nIt said an unfamiliar terrorist outfit “took advantage of the incident” and falsely labelled it as an “armed attack” and claimed responsibility. “This claim is not only baseless, but also tantamount to an example of opportunism and irrelevance.”",
