  "content": "QUETTA: Members of two Senate standing committees on Thursday heard concerns from Balochistan-based traders and recommended sweeping amendments to the barter trade framework to resolve a crippling trade crisis at the border, following two days of meetings with frustrated business leaders and provincial officials.\n\nThe two standing committees, Finance & Revenue and Commerce, aim to dismantle procedural bottlenecks that have paralysed commerce with Iran and Afghanistan and restore confidence among the local business community.\n\n“The government is fully committed to resolving these impediments and senate platforms remain available to play their role,” Committee chairs Anusha Rah­man and Saleem Mandviwala, said in a joint statement.\n\nIn Thursday’s meeting, held at the Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry (QCCI), representatives of the Chaman chamber presented a detailed account of the challenges.\n\nHears traders’ concern about crippling delays, lack of functional scanners, inoperable port facilities\n\nTraders told the committees that inefficient implementation of barter trade rules, coupled with a lack of inter-departmental coordination, has led to increased hardship instead of facilitating trade. Key among the complaints was the unavailability of functional scanners at the Chaman border, causing severe delays.\n\nThe Chaman chamber informed the committees that only a limited number of trucks are being allowed entry, leading to serious congestion and significant losses for businesses.\n\nThe limited capacity at the National Logistics Cell (NCL) terminal was highlighted as a major bottleneck, forcing hundreds of trucks to wait for days.\n\nBusinessmen said they are compelled to pay exorbitant charges due to the delays, while drivers lack access to basic facilities like shade, drinking water, or toilets.\n\nThe committees were also told that the recently constructed Chaman Dry Port, a project of significant investment, is still not operational.\n\nThey assured traders that they would recommend immediate follow-up and field visits by government departments to ensure factual oversight.\n\nNeed for federal action\n\nIn an earlier meeting on Wednesday, which also included Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti, the committee members recommended strategic amendments to the Barter Trade Mechanism 2023.\n\nHighlighting the untapped economic potential of the province, Senator Mandviwalla emphasised the need for federal action.\n\n“Despite its vast natural resources and strategic location, traders in Balochistan face persistent issues,” he said.\n\n“Our goal is to ensure that these concerns are addressed through federal legislation and actionable policy.”\n\nThe committee proposed amending the rigid 90-day condition for traders to balance import and export values, recommending a more flexible system reviewed by Customs in collaboration with traders.\n\nIt also endorsed extending the validity of barter trade authorisations from one year to three to provide greater certainty.\n\nAddressing another major hurdle, the committee recommended that the mandatory digital registration with the Pakistan Single Window (PSW) and WeBOC systems be handled by Customs, allowing traders in remote areas to submit data manually.\n\nPublished in Dawn, Aug 1st, 2025",
