The protest has led to the suspension of trade activities between China and Pakistan.\n\nThe traders have been demanding what the GB cabinet had suggested to the federal cabinet.\n\nThe GB cabinet asked the federal government to declare GB a non-tariff area and exempt the people of GB from collection of sales tax and income tax on goods being imported from China and ensure speedy clearance of consignments at Sost Dry Port under the amnesty scheme announced by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\n\nOn the call of Anjuman Tajiran of GB, the shutter-down strike was observed in Hunza, Nagar, Ghanche, Gilgit and Skardu. All markets, shops and business centres remained closed in these areas.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference after the GB cabinet meeting, Special Assistant to CM on Commerce Muhammad Ali Quaid, along with GB home minister Shams Lone and others said the GB cabinet discussed traders’ protest.\n\nProtesters want Gilgit-Baltistan declared ‘non-tariff’ area, seek exemption from sales and income tax\n\nDuring a recent visit to GB, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced one-time amnesty scheme for stuck-up consignments imported from China stuck at Sost Dry Port and constituted a committee led by Awais Leghari to settle the issue. The committee sought recommendations from the GB government to resolve the issue.\n\nMuhammad Ali Quaid said that GB traders and local residents have been demanding exemption of Sales Tax, Income Tax on items imported from China through Khunjerab Pass.\n\nHe said this is not only the demand of the GB traders but also the demand of the GB people, adding that collection of federal taxes from the region is illegal as the status of the region has not been decided by the federal government so far.\n\nHe said last year, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) had issued an SRO 1193 which already declared GB a non-tariff area and the GB government recommended the committee constituted by the prime minister to declare GB a non-tariff area and exempt its people from income tax and sales tax.\n\nThe special assistant said the GB cabinet also asked the committee to remove SRO 499 under which cases were registered on goods imported from China.\n\nThe GB cabinet also recommended the speedy clearance of the consignments stuck-up the port for the last 10 months and removal of cases registered against traders.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference in Sost, Pak-China Tajir Etihad Action Committee leaders said the peaceful protest movement of traders would continue till the acceptance of their demands. They said that economic exploitation of the GB people would not be accepted.\n\nThey said that over 200 consignments of goods were stuck at the Sost Dry Port and several of them have expired and damaged due to rains as the goods have been kept in the open area of the port. Besides, they said, port charges and other expenditures on them were increasing daily, causing losses of billions of rupees to GB traders.\n\nDespite the sit-in on the highway, protesters are allowing passengers travelling between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass, but they have blocked all kinds of business transportation.\n\nThe opposition has appealed to the federal government to settle the issue before it expands to other areas.\n\nAbbas Mir, one of the organisers, said the protesters would welcome any development at the GB and federal levels regarding the settlement of the issue.\n\nHe said collection of taxes from the GB region was illegal and unconstitutional adding that the people’s demand was clear is: “No taxation without representation”.\n\nHe said the GB had been deprived of its economic rights after the closure of business activities between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
