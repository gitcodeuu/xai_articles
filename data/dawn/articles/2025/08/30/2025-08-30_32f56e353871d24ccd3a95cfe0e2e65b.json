He said 2,518 projects worth Rs344 billion were completed or closed down in this process.\n\nThe secretary informed the committee that the IMF had also sent a questionnaire covering multiple areas, including Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and Public Investment Management (PIM), which were directly linked to the Planning Commission. Pakistan submitted the completed questionnaire on March 20, 2025.\n\nWhile discussing the IMF’s Diagnosis Report, it was revealed that the lender had pointed out weak project prioritisation, frequent delays, cost overruns, and inadequate protection of funds for approved projects as major shortcomings. The committee chair stressed that, in line with its earlier recommendations, ongoing projects should be completed before new ones are taken up.\n\nOn the panel’s previous recommendations, Mr Sumra said the standing committee had made 22 proposals, some of which had been implemented while others remained under consideration. The committee demanded a detailed compliance report on projects recommended by senators, but the ministry sought more time. The chair directed that the relevant ministries be called to the next meeting to present their reports.\n\nMr Sumra also briefed the committee on the Intelligent Project Automation System (iPAS), designed to streamline development processes by integrating systems, improving budget detail, and automating budget releases.\n\nTwo major projects\n\nThe National Highway Authority (NHA) presented updates on two major projects — the Sukkur-Hyderabad-Karachi Motorway (M-6) and Karachi-Quetta-Chaman Road (N-25).\n\nThe committee members were informed that the M-6 comprises five sections between Hyderabad and Sukkur. In the first phase, the Noushehroferoz-Ranipur and Ranipur-Sukkur sections were being prioritised, with formal approvals expected in September 2025.\n\nThe committee was told that the Islamic Development Bank would fund two sections of M-6, while negotiations with the Saudi Development Fund and Opec Fund for International Development were underway. A delegation from the Saudi Development Fund is scheduled to visit Pakistan in October.\n\nOn the Karachi-Hyderabad (M-10) Motorway, the committee was informed that the six-lane, 168km-long project had a preliminary estimated cost of Rs254bn, with final estimates to be determined after detailed design and commercial feasibility. It will be included in next year’s PSDP.\n\nThe committee chairperson expressed strong concern over NHA’s performance on the M-6 project, noting that the authority had already lost four months and was now seeking another four to finalise decisions under the PPP model. She directed the NHA to ensure work on the project begins by October 2025, warning that if the deadline was missed, the matter would be referred to the upper house of parliament for intervention.\n\nShe also instructed that the Economic Affairs Division and other relevant departments be called to the next meeting to brief the committee on measures for timely implementation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
