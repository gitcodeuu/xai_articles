He extended condolences over the loss of lives and the hardships faced by those affected by the monsoon rains and floods, according to an ADB press release.\n\n“Pakistan is experiencing devastating flooding that has displaced families and communities, and ADB stands firmly with Pakistan during this crisis,” Mr Kanda said.\n\n“When disasters strike, we respond quickly to help communities rebuild with dignity. This emergency support reflects our enduring commitment to Pakistan’s people through both immediate humanitarian needs and long-term development.”\n\nDuring the visit, the ADB president met Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and conveyed sympathies to the flood victims. Their discussions covered transformative investments, enhanced private sector engagement, and Pakistan’s role as a strategic supplier of critical minerals for the global clean energy transition.\n\nThey also reviewed ADB’s major capital investments in transport, energy, urban infrastructure, and human capital development through education and health programmes.\n\nMr Kanda welcomed the government’s progress on reforms, noting recent sovereign rating upgrades by major agencies supported by improved domestic resource mobilisation. He reaffirmed ADB’s commitment to deepening its partnership with Pakistan. The talks also covered ADB’s approval of a $410m financing package for the Reko Diq mining project, marking the bank’s return to mining sector financing after four decades. One of the world’s largest undeveloped copper-gold deposits, Reko Diq is expected to help Pakistan emerge as a strategic supplier of critical minerals for global clean energy needs.\n\nBeyond official meetings, Mr Kanda also engaged directly with communities and businesses. In Islamabad, he toured the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) One-Window Centre, interacted with beneficiaries, and jointly launched a Grievance Redressal Mechanism with BISP Chair Senator Rubina Khalid.\n\nIn Lahore, he visited Pakistan’s first sustainable aviation fuel facility, financed by the ADB, which converts waste cooking oils into fuel for export markets. He also met CEOs and business leaders to explore ways of expanding private sector participation and investment opportunities in Pakistan.\n\nMr Kanda also held discussions with ADB Governor and Minister for Economic Affairs Ahad Khan Cheema, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.\n\nTalks focused on Pakistan’s development priorities, reform agenda, and how transformative projects like Reko Diq can foster resilient, inclusive growth to better prepare the country for future challenges.\n\nThe ADB has supported Pakistan since it became a founding member in 1966, committing more than $43 billion to promote inclusive growth and improve infrastructure, energy, transport, and social services. Its current sovereign portfolio includes 44 operations valued at about $9bn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
