Some experts agree, saying there is no evidence of the existence of an organised group with a defined hierarchy that goes by that name.\n\nView from US\n\nLast month, the Trump administration described the Cartel de los Soles as a “Venezuela-based criminal group hea­d­­ed by Nicolas Maduro and other high-ranking Venezuelan individuals”.\n\nIt said the cartel “provides material support to foreign terrorist organisations threatening the peace and security of the United States, namely Tren de Aragua and the Sinaloa Cartel” — two major drug trafficking groups.\n\nWashington upped a bounty to $50 mil­­­lion for the capture of Maduro on drug charges. Yet in March, the latest US State Department report on global anti-drug operations made no ment­ion of the Cartel de los Sol­es or any connection betw­een Maduro and narco trafficking. The Uni­­­ted States did not recognize Maduro’s 2024 re-election, rejected by the Venez­u­elan opposition and much of the world as a stolen vote.\n\n“There is no such thing, so Maduro can hardly be its boss,” Phil Gunson, an analyst at the Inter­n­ational Crisis Group think tank, said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
