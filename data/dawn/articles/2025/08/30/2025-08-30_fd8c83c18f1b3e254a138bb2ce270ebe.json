However, no major Western dignitaries were among the two dozen world leaders at the event.\n\nSecurity around Beijing was tightened, with road closures, military personnel stationed on bridges and street corners, and miles upon miles of white barriers lining the capital’s wide boulevards.\n\nChina has touted the parade as a show of unity, and Kim’s attendance is the first time he has been seen with Xi and Putin at the same event. It is only his second reported trip abroad in six years.\n\nKim was accompanied on the trip by his daughter Kim Ju Ae, who was pictured arriving at Beijing Railway Station, and his sister Kim Yo Jong, who was photographed by AFP at a gala lunch.\n\nPutin and Kim held talks after today’s parade, during which the Russian president thanked Kim for deployments of North Korean soldiers to aid Russia in its conflict with Ukraine.\n\nLam Peng Er, principal research fellow from the East Asian Institute at the National University of Singapore, said Kim’s visit “demonstrates to the North Koreans and the world that he has powerful Russian and Chinese friends who treat him with respect”.\n\n“China also shows that it has convening power and political influence to bring Putin and Kim Jong Un together,” he told AFP.",
