A renowned disciplinarian who scatters expletives throughout her interviews, she is convinced Gout will dominate the world in time.\n\n“I’m not suggesting it. He’s going to go to that level,” she told Australian TV earlier this year.\n\n“Olympic gold. It might not be ’28 (Los Angeles), but definitely going to happen in 2032.”\n\nFor the moment, Gout is still a work in progress, relatively sluggish out of the blocks but impressive in the back half of races.\n\nIt will take around 20 seconds in Tokyo to get a read on his place among the big dogs of track and field but possibly years of development before he can hope to leave them in his wake.\n\nHeader image: Queensland’s Gout Gout celebrates after winning the Men’s 200m final in Perth, Australia on April 13, 2025 . — Reuters/File",
