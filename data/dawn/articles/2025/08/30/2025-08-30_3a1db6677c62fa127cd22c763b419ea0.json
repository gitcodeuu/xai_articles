He also briefed the delegation on the upcoming Industrial Policy, designed to enhance the investment climate. He said the government was working to broaden the tax base beyond manufacturing and salaried sectors, bringing services, wholesale, retail, and agriculture into the net, while also lowering energy and financing costs for businesses.\n\nOn privatisation, he said major transactions, including PIA and other state assets, would proceed in the coming weeks. Pakistan also planned to raise funds from international capital markets, including its first Panda bond and future Euro and dollar-denominated issuances.\n\nEmphasising the challenge of climate change, the minister said Pakistan required bankable adaptation projects to attract financing from multilateral institutions such as the IMF, World Bank, and ADB. He added that the country’s future lay in investment and export-led growth, with UAE investors playing a key role.\n\nThe visiting delegation expressed satisfaction with their interactions across government and business circles, admitting that Pakistan’s infrastructure, demographic profile, and strategic location offered long-term opportunities for investment.\n\nThe UAE investors also underlined the importance of expanding capital and human flows between the two countries to deepen economic ties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
