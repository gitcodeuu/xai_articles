  "content": "WASHINGTON: Microsoft has fired four employees who participated in protests on company premises against the firm’s ties to Israel as it devastates Gaza, including two who took part in a sit-in this week at the office of the company’s president.\n\nAnna Hattle and Riki Fameli received voicemails informing them that they were fired, the protest group No Azure for Apartheid said in a statement.\n\nIt added that two more workers, Nisreen Jaradat and Julius Shan, were fired. They were among protesters who had recently set up encampments at Microsoft headquarters.\n\nMicrosoft said the terminations followed serious breaches of company policies. In its Thursday statement, it said recent on-site demonstrations had “created significant safety concerns”.\n\nNo Azure for Apartheid, whose name references Microsoft’s Azure software, has demanded that the company cut its ties to Israel and pay reparations to Palestinians.\n\n“We are here because Microsoft continues to provide Israel with the tools it needs to commit genocide while gaslighting and misdirecting its own workers about this reality,” Hattle said in a statement.\n\nHattle and Fameli were among seven protesters who were arrested on Tuesday after occupying the office of company President Brad Smith. The other five were former Microsoft workers and people outside the company.\n\nSmith has said Microsoft respected “freedom of expression that everyone in this country enjoys as long as they do it lawfully”.\n\nA joint media investigation published this month found that an Israeli military surveillance agency was making use of Microsoft’s Azure software to store countless recordings of mobile phone calls made by Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza.\n\nThe investigation, conducted by the Guardian, Israeli—Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, said Israel relied on Microsoft cloud for expansive surveillance of Palestinians.\n\nIn response, Microsoft said it was turning to law firm Covington & Burling LLP to conduct a review.\n\nOther Microsoft workers have also protested the company’s ties to Israel.\n\nIn April, Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman’s remarks were interrupted by a pro-Palestinian protesting employee during the technology company’s 50th anniversary celebration over the firm’s ties with Israel.\n\nThat employee and another protesting employee were also subsequently fired.\n\nFirms and educational institutions have faced protests over ties with Israel as the humanitarian crisis in Gaza from Israel’s military assault has mounted, and images of starving Palestinians, including children, have sparked global outrage.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
