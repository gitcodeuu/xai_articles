The event will bring together representatives from over 45 countries, marking one of the largest multilateral parliamentary gatherings ever hosted by Pakistan.\n\nMr Gilani said the conference would address key global challenges, including regional peace, sustainable development, climate change and the need for collective strategies to tackle emerging threats.\n\nMr Sadiq assured Mr Gilani of the National Assembly’s full support in ensuring the successful organisation of the conference, expressing confidence that the event would serve as a significant opportunity for Pakistan to showcase its commitment to global dialogue, cooperation, and peace-building.\n\nBoth leaders also discussed the prevailing political and economic situation in the country, with a particular focus on the devastating impact of recent rains and floods. They expressed concern over the exacerbating situation caused by India’s release of floodwaters into Punjab’s rivers, which has intensified both human and material losses in the affected areas.\n\nIn light of the natural calamity, the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker appealed to the people of Pakistan to take precautionary measures and fully cooperate with the government and relevant authorities. They stressed the need for united national efforts to minimise casualties and reduce financial damages.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
