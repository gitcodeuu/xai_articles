  "content": "KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has introduced a new online reporting system to monitor banks’ investments abroad and ensure compliance with foreign exchange regulations.\n\nIn a circular issued on Friday, the central bank said it had developed the Performance Evaluation System for Investment Abroad (PESIA), an online mechanism for authorised dealers (ADs) to submit data on equity investment abroad (EIA) transactions through SBP’s Data Acquisition Portal (DAP).\n\nThe system comprises 10 Data File Structures (DFS), each designed to capture different categories of EIA transactions undertaken by banks either on their own account or on behalf of clients. These structures contain distinct variables and logic tailored to specific reporting requirements.\n\nThe SBP directed banks to submit compliance reports, duly signed by their Group Head of Compliance, confirming that the data has been provided accurately and in full, free of errors, and within the specified timelines. The first such report is due by March 5, 2026.\n\nIt will be the responsibility of the Head of the EIA Unit and Group Head Compliance of each AD to ensure data integrity and accuracy. Any lapses, including incomplete or incorrect reporting, would be considered violations.\n\n“The SBP will take appropriate enforcement action against delinquent authorised dealers or their staff under the relevant provisions of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act 1947, or other applicable laws,” the circular warned.\n\nThe move reflects SBP’s growing emphasis on monitoring foreign investments by banks and strengthening oversight to prevent regulatory breaches.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 30th, 2025",
