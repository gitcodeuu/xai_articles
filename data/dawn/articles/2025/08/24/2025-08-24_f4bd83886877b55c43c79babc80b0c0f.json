A girl sat on the edge of a tent and scooped rice from a plastic bag on the ground.\n\n“We have no home left, no food, no income… so we are forced to turn to charity kitchens, but they do not satisfy our hunger,” said Yousef Hamad, 58, who was displaced from the northern city of Beit Hanoun.\n\nThe chief of UN agency for Palestinian refugees asks Israel to ‘stop denying the famine it has created’\n\nFurther south at a charity kitchen in Deir el Balah, 34-year-old Umm Mohammad said the UN’s declaration of a famine had come “far too late”. The children are “staggering from dizziness, unable to wake up because of the lack of food and water”, she added.\n\nThe UN officially declared a famine in Gaza on Friday, blaming the “systematic obstruction” of aid by Israel during more than 22 months of conflict. The Rome-based Integrated Food Security Phase Classification Initiative (IPC) said famine was affecting 500,000 people in Gaza governorate, which covers about a fifth of the Palestinian territory, including Gaza City.\n\n‘Moral duty’\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected the famine report as “an outright lie”.\n\nOn Saturday, the head of the UN agen­­cy for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said it was “time for the government of Israel to stop denying the famine it has created in Gaza”.\n\n“All of those who have influence must use it with determination & a sense of moral duty,” UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini posted on X.\n\nThe IPC projected that the famine would expand to Deir el Balah and Khan Yunis governorates by the end of Sept­ember, covering around two-thirds of Gaza. Israel kept up its bombardment of the Palestinian territory, with a footage sho­wing heavy smoke billowing above the Zeitoun district of Gaza City as Pales­ti­nians picked through the wreckage of buildings.\n\n‘Feel like end is near’\n\nThe spokesman for Gaza’s civil defence agency, Mahmud Bassal, called the situation in the Sabra and Zeitoun neighbourhoods “absolutely catastrophic”, describing the “complete levelling of entire residential blocks”.\n\n“We are trapped here, living in fear, with nowhere to go. There’s no safety anywhere in Gaza. Movement now leads to death,” said Ahmad Jundiyeh, 35, who was displaced to the northern outskirts of Zeitoun. “We constantly hear the sound of bombing… we hear fighter jets, artillery shelling and even drone explosions,” he said. “We’re extremely afraid — it feels like the end is near.”\n\nIsrael’s Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed on Friday that Israel would destroy Gaza City as it has other parts of the territory if Hamas did not agree to disarm, release all remaining prisoners and “end the war on Israel’s terms”.\n\nResidents of Gaza City said the Israeli strikes targeting the area had been relentless for days. “Let them come and see what’s happening to us here on the ground in Zeitoun district. We have been ruined,” said Aymen Daloul, a 53-year-old from Gaza City whose home had been destroyed.\n\n“We shall sleep on the streets as if we were cattle. Have mercy on us.”\n\nMahmud Abu Saqer, 24, said there had been a quickening exodus of residents ever since Israel announced its plans to seize Gaza City. “Just this morning, more than 500 to 600 families left, and yesterday thousands left,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 24th, 2025",
