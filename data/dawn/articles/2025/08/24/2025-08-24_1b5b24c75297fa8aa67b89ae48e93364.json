They were shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital in Miramshah, where they are receiving medical treatment.\n\nAccording to hospital sources, both children are out of danger.\n\nFollowing the incident, a large police force arrived at the scene, cordoned off the area, and launched an investigation.\n\nInitial investigations suggest that the toy-like bomb was thrown or left at an unknown location and was brought home by the children thinking it was a toy.\n\nMeanwhile, a curfew has been imposed across North Waziristan, as is done every Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAccording to the district administration, the curfew is enforced to facilitate the movement of security forces and ensure safety measures. During this time, public movement remains restricted, causing difficulties for residents.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 24th, 2025",
