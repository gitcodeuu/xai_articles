  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi on Saturday approved a series of major development initiatives for the federal capital.\n\nHe was chairing a high-level meeting at the Capital Development Authority (CDA) headquarters. The projects, ranging from new traffic infrastructure to housing sector upgrades and hospitality ventures, aim to ease urban challenges and enhance civic facilities for residents.\n\nOne of the key decisions was the launch of a flyover at T-Chowk and an underpass at Shaheen Chowk, with groundbreaking scheduled for early September.\n\nThe minister also ordered a city-wide operation against encroachments, emphasising that there would be “no leniency” in removing illegal structures. He set September 30 as the deadline for clearing affected sectors, assigning the responsibility to senior officials, including the SSP Operations, ADCG, and Director DMA.\n\nHousing societies were warned to strictly comply with regulations or face disciplinary action. The meeting also approved Phase One of the Diplomatic Enclave Upgradation Project, covering improvements to the main entrance from Constitution Avenue, adjoining roads, a boundary wall, a cycling track, and a park.\n\nOther projects reviewed included remodelling Daman-i-Koh for visitors, accelerating work on sectors C-14, C-15, and C-16 under construction, and expediting long-delayed development in sectors E-12 and I-12 so possession can finally be handed over to allottees. Naqvi directed the CDA to prepare a comprehensive development plan for the new sectors C-13, D-13, E-13, and F-13.\n\nHe also set a December 31 deadline for completing groundwork on two new five-star hotels in Islamabad. According to briefings, the first phase of the Model Jail project is progressing and will be completed soon, while a site has been allocated for the establishment of a Capital House.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 24th, 2025",
