  "content": "KARACHI: Thousands of banking transactions, valued in the hundreds of millions, were delayed or stuck due to power outages caused by heavy rains across the country, according to financial market sources.\n\nWhile digital transactions in major cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Pesha­war remained large­ly unaffected, some of the more remote districts, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, faced significant disruptions. Bankers also observed that physical cash transactions were more challenging during the rains.\n\n“I have not received any complaints from cities like Lahore, Peshawar, or Karachi regarding digital transactions, but areas such as Swat have been facing prolonged power cuts, sometimes lasting up to six days,” said a trader in Karachi.\n\nThe issue has been compounded by ATM outages in many parts of Karachi, although most machines have since been restored. However, customers in interior Sindh and other provinces continue to face problems with ATM functionality.\n\nOver recent years, digital banking has experienced rapid growth, replacing traditional paper-based banking methods. Yet, this shift has not been without its challenges. The rise in digital transactions has coincided with an increase in fraud cases, with many customers expressing concerns over the safety and reliability of online banking platforms.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 24th, 2025",
