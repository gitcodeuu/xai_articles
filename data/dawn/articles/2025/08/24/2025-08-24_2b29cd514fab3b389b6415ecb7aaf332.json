  "content": "GUJRAT: Four members of Hamid Nasir Chattha’s family have submitted nomination papers for NA-66 (Wazirabad) but only one of them will contest in case Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaaf leadership allows them to contest.\n\nThe nomination papers were filed by Ain Ahmed Chattha, the wife of de-seated PTI MNA Muhammad Ahmed Chattha, who is also the PTI central Punjab president.\n\nThe other three are Fayaz Chattha, a two-time former district Nazim of Gujranwala, his wife Urooj Fayaz Chattha and his daughter Neha Fayaz Chattha.\n\nAhmed Chattha and Fayaz Chattha are the scions of Hamid Nasir Chattha.\n\nTalking to Dawn by phone, Ahmed Chattha said his wife Ain Chattha would contest as a PTI candidate if the party leadership permitted them. He said that PTI founder Imran Khan had allowed party’s political committee to decide on whether to contest the by-poll.\n\nAsked in case the PTI boycotted the by-poll, he said none from his family would contest without the PTI’s permission. Ahmed Chattha said he won, after all odds and rigging, a National Assembly and a Punjab Assembly seat each during the 2024 election from Wazirabad and vacated the PA seat later as per requirement.\n\nSources in PTI said a majority of members of party’s political committee were in favour of contesting the by-poll despite all reservations and concerns but discussion was still on.\n\nMeanwhile, 29 aspirants, with 18 belonging to the ruling PML-N, have filed nomination papers for NA-66 by-poll scheduled to be held on Sept 18.\n\nThe PML-N has announced ex-MPA Bilal Farooq Tarrar, the brother of federal minister for information Attaullah Tarrar, as its candidate. Other aspirants for the party ticket may withdraw their nomination papers by Monday.\n\nEx-MPA Ijaz Samman of Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) and Muhammad Akram of Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) are also among the aspirants. However, sources said that PPP’s Ijaz Samman might withdraw his nomination papers as the party leadership has decided to support the PML-N in the by-poll.\n\nJamaat-i-Islami that usually contests the poll in Wazirabad has not fielded any candidate.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 24th, 2025",
