  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) on Saturday disapproved recent amendments to the Supreme Court Rules, 2025, which include an increase in court fee, describing it as a violation of the fundamental rights.\n\nThe PBC executive committee in a meeting, which was presided over by chairman Muhammad Yaseen Azad, noted that the changes to the rules violated Article 37(d) of the Constitution, which “ensures inexpensive and expeditious justice”.\n\nThe executive committee regretted the substitution of the old SC Rules, 1980, disclosing that the apex court did not even consult or take on board the bar council regarding the increase in court fee.\n\nThrough a resolution, the PBC demanded an immediate withdrawal of the amendments, particularly in respect of increase in court fee that the council believes disproportionately affects the poor segments of society to have access to justice.\n\nMultiparty conference\n\nInterestingly, the bar council also decided to organise an ‘All Parties Conference’ in Islamabad on Sept 27. Leaders of political parties and representatives of different bar councils and associations would be invited to the Islamabad sitting for what the PBC said formulation of a uniform and comprehensive national strategy “to counter terrorism and strengthen the country’s economy”.\n\nDemands immediate withdrawal of increase in court fee; plans to host multiparty conference\n\nThe executive committee earlier strongly condemned and expressed deep concern over the ‘unlawful and unwarranted’ raid conducted by officials of the counterterrorism department, accompanied by men in plainclothes, at the residence of former judge Zahoor Ahmed Shahwani.\n\nIt was also noted with regret that the security officials entered the premises without a search warrant, violating both the sanctity of the home and the privacy of the family. It emphasised that such actions undermine respect for the law and due process.\n\nBesides, the committee strongly condemned the intimidating, unlawful and disrespectful conduct of the SHO and other officials of the Matta police station towards a member of the Matta Bar Association, Upper Swat, Shahid Khan.\n\nIt said any such attack on the integrity and reputation of advocates would amount to interfering with the legal profession, which could not be permitted by the bar council. These actions not only threatened the safety of individual advocates but also undermined the integrity of the legal system as a whole, the PBC resolution stated.\n\nThe committee also expressed its deepest sorrow and strongest condemnation over the killing of Mian Asim Kakakhel, (junior apprenticeship advocate), the younger brother of Advocate Syed Muhammad Zohiab, by police.\n\nThis heinous act was not only an assault on the sanctity of human life but also a grave attack on the independence, dignity, and safety of the legal fraternity, it noted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 24th, 2025",
