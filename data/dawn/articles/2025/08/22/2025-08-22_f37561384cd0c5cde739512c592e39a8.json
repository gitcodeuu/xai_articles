In return, Israel would release about 200 long-serving Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nOnce the temporary ceasefire begins, both sides will begin negotiations on a permanent ceasefire that would include the return of the remaining prisoners.\n\nCeasefire demanded\n\nUnited Nations Secre­tary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, after Isra­el announced the first steps of an operation to take over Gaza City.\n\n“It is vital to reach immediately a ceasefire in Gaza,” that was necessary “to avoid the death and destruction that a military operation against Gaza City would inevitably cause,” Guterres said in Japan where he is attending the Tokyo International Conference on African Development.\n\nGuterres also called for the unconditional release of prisoners held by Hamas and also urged Israel to reverse a decision to expand “illegal” settlement construction in the West Bank.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the UNRWA voiced concern that children suffering from malnutrition in Gaza will die if emergency provisions are not immediately put in place during Israel’s Gaza City military operation.\n\nPhilippe Lazzarini said that its data showed a six-fold increase in the number of children suffering from malnutrition in Gaza City since March.\n\nHeavy bombardment\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said at least 70 people had been killed in Israeli fire in the enclave in the past 24 hours, including eight people in a house in Sabra suburb in Gaza City.\n\nThe Israeli military maintained its pressure on Gaza City with heavy bombardments overnight. A day earlier, the military called up 60,000 reservists in a sign that the government was pressing ahead with the plan, despite international condemnation.\n\nIn a sign of growing despair at conditions, hundreds rallied in Gaza City in a march organised by several civil unions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 22nd, 2025",
