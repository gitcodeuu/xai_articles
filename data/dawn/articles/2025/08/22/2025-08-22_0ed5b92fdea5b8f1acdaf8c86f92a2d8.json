But Moscow later cast doubt on any such arrangement, Lavrov saying on Wednesday that discussing them without Russia was “a utopia, a road to nowhere”.\n\n“When Russia raises the issue of security guarantees, I honestly do not yet know who is threatening them,” said Zelensky, who wants foreign troops in Ukraine to deter Russian attacks in the future.\n\nThe Kremlin has long said it would never accept that, citing Ukraine’s Nato ambition as one of the pretexts for its assault.\n\n“There are several principles which Washington believes must be accepted, including no Nato membership, including the discussion of territorial issues, and Zelensky said no to everything,” Lavrov told NBC.\n\nOn a visit to Kyiv, during which an air raid alert sounded across the city, Rutte said security guarantees were needed to ensure “Russia will uphold any deal and will never ever again attempt to take one square kilometre of Ukraine”.\n\nMoscow signed the Budapest Memorandum in 1994, which was aimed at ensuring security for Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan in exchange for them giving up numerous nuclear weapons left from the Soviet era.\n\nRussia violated that first by taking Crimea in 2014, and then by starting a full-scale offensive in 2022, which has killed tens of thousands of people and forced millions to flee their homes.\n\nTrump said on Friday he would make an “important” decision in two weeks on Ukraine peace efforts, specifying that Moscow could face massive sanctions or he might do nothing.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that he was “not happy” about a Russian strike on Thursday that hit a US-owned factory in Ukraine, and “I’m not happy about anything having to do with that war.” But he said he wanted to see whether Putin and Zelensky would meet first.\n\n“I think I’ll know. I think I’ll know the attitude of Russia, and, frankly, of Ukraine. It takes two,” Trump said when asked what he would do at the end of a two-week timeframe he set for assessing the state of peace talks.\n\n“Then I’m going to make a decision as to what we do and it’s going to be a very important decision,” he said. “That’s whether or not it’s massive sanctions or massive tariffs or both. Or do we do nothing and say it’s your fight.”",
