Chile’s national disaster response service (Senapred) described the earthquake as “medium intensity” and said a “precautionary alert” had been issued for the Antarctic territory.\n\nA source from the Chilean interior ministry said “there is no danger for the Magallanes region,” the southernmost inhabited area of the South American continent.\n\nThe state of precaution “requires abandoning beach areas” and “rocky shores” of the national Antarctic territory, according to Senapred.\n\nA magnitude 5.6 earthquake also struck near the Myanmar-India border on Friday, the European Mediterranean Seismological Centre (EMSC) said.\n\nThe quake was at a depth of 10 km (6.2 miles), the EMSC added.",
