He arrived at the Islamabad airport on August 15 to drive home where his wedding preparations were in full swing for two days later. Instead, he attended 24 funerals.\n\nThey included his mother, a brother and a sister, he said, adding that his father and another brother survived because they had gone to pick him up at the airport.\n\nThe rest of the fatalities were among his uncles’ families who shared the house built by his grandfather, and relatives who are attending his marriage.\n\nHis fiance survived. Her home was away from the worst of the damage.\n\nThe flash floods triggered by the worst of this year’s monsoon and cloudbursts, which started in the mountainous northern areas have spread to other parts of the country of 240 million, bringing death and destruction at a large scale.\n\nAuthorities have said the longer spell of heavy rain and rare cloudbursts were rooted in climate change due to global warming, fearing the intensity will increase in the coming years.\n\n“We and our elders have never seen a storm like this in our lives,” said Muhammad Zeb, 28, a resident in Buner. It was a complete chaos, and massive disaster, he added.\n\n“You can see for yourself, this was a beautiful place with homes. But now, as you can see, the flood and storm have swept everything away.”\n\nAn unknown number of people remain missing, with dead bodies still being recovered, officials said.\n\nThe overall death toll across the country in the monsoon rains which began in late June stood at 776, according to the National Disaster Management Authority, which said more than 25,000 people had been rescued in the northern areas.\n\nThe army and air force have joined the rescue and relief efforts.\n\nOfficials have warned of more storms ahead with another two spells of monsoon rain expected until September 10.\n\nBuner received more than 150 mm (5.91 inches)of rain within an hour triggered by a cloudburst in the single most destructive event in this monsoon season. A cloudburst is a rare phenomenon where more than 100mm (3.9 inches) of rainfall within an hour in a small area.\n\nOnly four people of the 28 in his house survived, Muhammad said. “What else can we say? It’s God’s will,” he said.\n\nHeader image: Residents gather near a house damaged by rocks and boulders, following a storm that caused heavy rains and flooding in Qadir Nagar area, in KP’s Buner district on August 21. — Reuters",
