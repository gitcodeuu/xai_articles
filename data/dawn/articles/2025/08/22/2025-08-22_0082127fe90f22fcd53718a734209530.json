  "content": "BEIRUT: Armed Palestinian groups in refugee camps in Lebanon started handing over their weapons to the authorities on Thursday, a joint committee said, following a deal reached in May.\n\nThe announcement comes after the Lebanese government also tasked the army with formulating a plan to disarm Hezbollah by the end of the year. “Today marks the beginning of the first phase of the process of handing over weapons from inside the Palestinian camps,” Lebanese-Palestinian Dialogue Committee chairman Ramez Dimashkieh said in a statement.\n\nThe process would begin with the Burj al-Barajneh camp in Beirut, where an initial batch of weapons would be placed in the custody of the Lebanese army, Dimashkieh added.\n\nPhotojournalist saw dozens of fighters in military fatigues holding Kalashnikov rifles as crowds gathered in front of the Beirut headquarters of Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas’s Fatah movement.\n\nUS praises Beirut for taking the initiative\n\nA Palestinian security official said that “Fatah will begin handing over its weapons in Burj al-Barajneh camp within the framework of the coordination with the Lebanese army”.\n\nAbbas visited Beirut in May and reached an agreement with Lebanese President Joseph Aoun that all arms in Palestinian camps would be surrendered to the state.\n\nA Palestinian security source at Burj al-Barajneh camp said “Fatah’s initiative in beginning to hand over weapons is symbolic, and came as a result of an agreement between Aoun and the Palestinian president’s son, Yasser Abbas, who is currently visiting Beirut”.\n\nIt aims to “encourage the remaining (Palestinian armed) factions to take the same step”, the source said, noting that the other influential factions in the camp “have not yet decided to hand over their weapons”.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority does not exercise power over the remaining factions in the camps, most notably Hamas.\n\n‘Illegitimate weapons’\n\nLebanon has come under heavy US pressure to disarm Hamas’s ally Hezbollah after the Iran-backed Lebanese movement was dealt a massive blow during its war with Israel last year.\n\nThat conflict was the culmination of a year of hostilities launched by Hezbollah in support of Hamas after the Palestinian group’s Oct 2023 raid on Israel that sparked the Gaza war.\n\nLebanon hosts about 222,000 Palestinian refugees, according to the United Nations agency UNRWA, with many living in overcrowded camps outside of the state’s control.\n\nThe Ain al-Hilweh camp near the southern city of Sidon, for instance, is the largest in the country and houses individuals wanted by the Lebanese authorities.\n\nThe handover of weapons was expected to begin in mid-June, but in an interview with Saudi-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya last week, Aoun attributed the delay to the Iran-Israel war that broke out that month, as well as to “internal considerations within the Palestinian Authority”.\n\nBadie al-Habet, a member of the Fatah leadership in Beirut, said that Thursday would see the “turning over of illegitimate weapons in the hands of illegitimate individuals”.\n\nThe weapons held by Palestinian security personnel in the refugee camps, however, were not included in the handover, he added. Palestinian armed factions, including Hamas, have repeatedly fired at Israel from Lebanon since the start of the Gaza war and the ensuing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, which a November ceasefire sought to end.\n\nThe ceasefire stipulated that only the Lebanese military would bear arms and that all forces would withdraw from the country’s south, with the exception of the army and UN peacekeepers.\n\nIsrael has nonetheless continued to strike Lebanon regularly, and its troops still hold five positions in the south that it deems strategic. Hezbollah, meanwhile, has said it will resist efforts to disarm it.\n\nUS envoy congratulates govt\n\nUS envoy Tom Barrack on Thursday hailed steps to begin disarming groups operating in Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon.\n\nBarrack congratulated the government and the Palestinian Fatah movement on their “agreement on voluntary disarmament in Beirut camps, a great accomplishment as a result of the bold action recently taken by the Lebanese Council of Ministers. A historic step toward unity and stability, showing true commitment to peace and cooperation.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 22th, 2025",
