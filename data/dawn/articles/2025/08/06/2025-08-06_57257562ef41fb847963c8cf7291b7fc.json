It added that the ruling coalition’s recently acquired two-thirds majority in the parliament needed for a Constitutional Amendment “ignited rumours that the army chief could become president too”.\n\nThe government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with Gen Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.\n\nOn July 10, Naqvi asserted that President Asif Ali Zardari “enjoys a strong and respectful relationship with the leadership of the armed forces”.\n\nHe quoted the president as having “clearly” stated: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”\n\nNaqvi stressed that the “sole focus” of COAS Munir was Pakistan’s strength and stability, and “nothing else”.\n\nIn May, President Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif formally decorated COAS Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.\n\nThe rank of field marshal is the highest rank of armies built on the pattern of the British Army. It has only been awarded to one other — Gen Ayub Khan — by the presidential cabinet in 1959. It is a ceremonial five-star rank that usually signifies extraordinary leadership and wartime achievement.\n\nIn a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.\n\nThe next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.",
