You all will have to do negotiations,” he said.\n\nLaw Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar also called for meaningful dialogue between all political forces to address the country’s national challenges. He stressed that differences should be resolved through consensus, not confrontation.\n\nSardar Latif Khosa, another firebrand PTI MNA, termed it a welcome offer, but said it had come after wrongfully denying reserved seats to the opposition.\n\n‘No new military operation’\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of State for Int­e­rior Talal Chaudhry clarified that no new military offensive was being launched in Bajaur or any other region. However, he insisted that both armed and non-armed components of the National Action Plan (NAP) were still in effect.\n\nHe emphasised that political backing for security forces was crucial in combating terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\n\nThe minister expressed satisfaction over the recent cooperation with Iran, following the visit of the Iranian president.“\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 6th, 2025",
