They said ulema wielded significant influence and enjoying societal respect due to their contributions to religious education.\n\nMufti Ihsanul Haq, who is also the president of All Bajaur Islamic Madaris Muhtamim Association, a body of seminary administrators and owners, said religious leaders had always played their role whenever the district faced issues. “As part of society, we cannot ignore peace, which is a crucial issue affecting the general public.”\n\nWhile extending full support to the Bajaur Aman Jirga to push the talks’ process forward, the participants said religious leaders were united in their resolve to end the conflict peacefully.\n\nMufti Ihsanul Haq also announced the formation of a committee to meet with the jirga and offer help in making the negotiations result-oriented.\n\nMeanwhile, negotiations between Bajaur Aman Jirga and banned TTP resumed on Tuesday after a one-day break. The fourth round between 50-member jirga and banned TTP was held in Lowi Mamund.\n\nSahibzada Haroon Rashid, the jirga head, said the meeting was held a day after the jirga members met with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur in Peshawar.\n\nIn a social media post on Tuesday evening, Mr Rashid said details of the meeting would be shared once both sides reached a mutual agreement.\n\nHe also urged the local media to refrain from speculating about the negotiation process, warning that it could potentially impact the proceedings.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 6th, 2025",
