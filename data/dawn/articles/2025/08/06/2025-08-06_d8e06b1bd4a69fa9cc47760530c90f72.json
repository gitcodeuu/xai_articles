Her body was recovered miles away in the Rawat area, at the bank of the nullah,” the SHO said.\n\nThe official added that all aspects of her death would be investigated after receiving postmortem reports.\n\nLast month, the prime suspect in the Arshman Akhtar murder case was killed in an alleged encounter with the police.\n\nFour-year-old Arshman Akhtar’s body was found in a pond in Rawat in November last year after going missing from a wedding.\n\nAlso in July, a man allegedly gunned down his 16-year-old daughter over her refusal to delete her TikTok account in the limits of Rawat police station.",
