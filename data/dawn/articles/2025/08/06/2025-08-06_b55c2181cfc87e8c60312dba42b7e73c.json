  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Tuesday decided to fence the Margalla Hills National Park (MHNP).\n\nSources said the civic agency will start installing pillars and fences from the Taxila side, and the exercise will be completed near the boundary of Murree.\n\n“The ambiguity of the boundary always provides a chance to land grabbers for making encroachment on state land. After fencing, confusion will be cleared for good,” said an official.\n\nHe said that after fencing, the private land in Zone III and MHNP will be two separate entities.\n\nSources said that a few days ago, CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa, along with board members, visited the Taxila side of Islamabad ahead of the fencing work.\n\nBoundary pillars will be installed from Taxila side up to Murree, separating private land from the national park, says official\n\n“We have decided to protect MHNP with proper installation of boundary pillars and fencing,” said the chairman.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Mr Randhawa said MHNP is a signature beauty of Islamabad and the CDA, in collaboration with other government organisations such as the Climate Change Ministry, will ensure the protection of these hills and their flora and fauna.\n\n“Today, I have directed the engineering wing to start fencing of the hills,” he said, adding that the CDA will ensure completion of this fencing project in the shortest possible time.\n\n“After fencing, the issue of encroachment in the national park area will be settled. There would be a clear fence to divide the national park and private land,” he said, adding that after fencing, the CDA will ensure its protection.\n\nIt is relevant to note here that the boundaries of MHNP were already demarcated by the Survey of Pakistan in 2008 and 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, a member of the CDA board told Dawn that within a few months, the process of fencing would be completed. Some years ago, the CDA had started fencing work, but it was halted at the initial stage.\n\n“I have no idea about past practice, but this time round, we will install boundary markers and simultaneously we will carry out fencing work… we are hopeful we will get this project completed within a few months,” the CDA member said.\n\nCDA’s Zone III comprises over 50,000 acres, and out of it, around 30,000 acres is part of the national park. The remaining 20,000 acres in Zone III is private land where a large number of villagers are settled.\n\nInterestingly, the CDA is neither acquiring this private land nor allowing the locals to carry out construction in accordance with any approved design. Resultantly, this zone is giving the appearance of slums, as the CDA is providing no basic facilities to the people.\n\n“Besides fencing of the national park, the CDA should also take up the issue of Zone III to bring it under any regulation. Imposing a blanket ban on construction in this zone on private land is not a workable solution. How can the CDA stop anyone from constructing a house on his/her own land? There should be some sort of solution,” said an official of the CDA.\n\nHe said that the Islamabad administration had imposed a ban on the transfer of land in Zone III, but people are still buying and selling land on stamp papers.\n\n“There should be a workable solution. The CDA should acquire the entire Zone III or introduce regulations to control construction, along with provision of basic facilities such as a sewerage system, paved streets, and clean drinking water,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 6th, 2025",
