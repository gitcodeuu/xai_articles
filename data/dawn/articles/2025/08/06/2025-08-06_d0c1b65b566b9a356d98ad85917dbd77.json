  "content": "QUETTA: Over 650,000 children across Balochistan have received emergency treatment through ChildLife Foundation’s Children’s Emergency Rooms and Telemedicine Satellite Centres (TSCs).\n\nThis achievement has been made possible through the partnership with the Balochistan government.\n\nThe ChildLife Found­ation operates a state-of-the-art Children’s Emergency Room at Sandeman Provincial Hospital, Quetta, along with 32 TSCs in secondary care hospitals across Balochistan. Together, these centers ensure that critically ill children have access to 24/7, free-of-cost emergency care.\n\n“Every child deserves a chance to survive, regardless of where they are born or their socio-economic status,” said Dr Ahson Rabbani, CEO of ChildLife Foundation. “Our partnership with the government of Balochistan is bridging emergency care gaps by bringing expert pediatric services to underserved areas. Together, we are laying the foundation for a healthier, more equitable future for all children in Pakistan.”\n\nChildLife’s pediatric emergency model has garnered global recognition for having the same mortality rate among critically ill children as that at Pakistan’s leading private hospital.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 6th, 2025",
