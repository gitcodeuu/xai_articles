He played 50 times for the Portuguese national team.\n\nHe belongs to the golden generation of Portuguese players who won the 1991 Under-20 World Cup, alongside Luis Figo.\n\n“It’s a shock,” Prime Minister Luis Montenegro wrote on social media, hailing Costa as “an example of dedication and commitment”.\n\nPorto’s rivals Benfica and Sporting Lisbon also paid tribute.\n\n“Portuguese football is poorer,” Benfica said in a statement, saluting “a key figure in football and national sport, first as a player, then as a coach, and, more recently, as a manager”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 6th, 2025",
