  "content": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Panic gripped District Headquarters Wana on Tuesday when unidentified attackers fired a rocket targeting a Scouts camp.\n\nAccording to police sources, the rocket was launched from the Doag area on the outskirts of the town and was aimed at targeting Lower Wana security camp.\n\nPolice officials said fortunately the rocket missed its intended target and landed in a seasonal stream (nullah) just outside the camp’s perimeter. There were no reports of casualties or property damage, though the explosion caused widespread fear and concern among local residents.\n\nPolice and security personnel reached the site after the incident and cordoned off the area.\n\nAn investigation was launched, with initial efforts focused on tracing the origin of the attack and identifying those responsible.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies are said to be collecting evidence from nearby locations and pursuing multiple lines of inquiry.\n\nPolice officials said that the motive behind such attacks is to destabilise the region and undermine public confidence in the government’s ability to maintain law and order.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the incident so far, and the authorities have yet to make any arrests.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 6th, 2025",
