  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government will ensure an uninterrupted supply of fertiliser ahead of the Kharif season to farmers, says Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain.\n\nThe minister stated this during a meeting with Engro Fertilisers Chief Executive Officer Ali Rathore on Friday.\n\nThe discussion centred on guaranteeing consistent fertiliser supply nationwide, stabilising prices for farmers, and introducing forward-looking measures to strengthen the agriculture sector’s resilience.\n\nMr Hussain stressed that timely and affordable access to fertiliser is not merely a commercial matter but a critical pillar of Pakistan’s food security and economic stability.\n\nHe reaffirmed the government’s determination to protect farmers from market manipulation by eliminating hoarding, curbing black marketing, and enforcing strict adherence to national quality standards.\n\nHe emphasised that any disruption in the supply of fertiliser directly impacts crop yields and can jeopardise the livelihoods of millions of farming households.\n\nThe minister urged Engro Fertilisers to expand its distribution network, particularly in remote rural areas, and to align supply schedules with the agricultural calendar to avoid shortages during peak sowing periods.\n\nHe also highlighted the importance of innovation in delivery systems, including farmer facilitation centres and mobile supply networks, so that small-scale farmers have equal access to quality inputs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 16th, 2025",
