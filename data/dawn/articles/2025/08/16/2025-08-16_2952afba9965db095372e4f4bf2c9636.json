The plan envisages a Palestinian state in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza, territories Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war.\n\nIsrael cites historical and biblical ties to the area and says the settlements provide security, viewing the West Bank as “disputed” rather than “occu­pied”. About 700­,000 Israeli settlers live among 2.7 million Pale­stinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.\n\nSudan settlement\n\nMeanwhile, Reuters reported on Friday that South Sudan and Israel were discussing a deal to resettle Palestinians from war-torn Gaza in the troubled African nation, a plan that was quickly dismissed as unacceptable by Palestinian leaders.\n\nAlthough no agreement had been reached, but talks between South Sudan and Israel were ongoing.\n\nThe plan, if carried further, would envisage people moving from an enclave shattered by almost two years of war with Israel to a nation in the heart of Africa riven by years of political and ethnically-driven violence.\n\nBut the account appeared to contradict South Sudan’s foreign ministry which on Wednesday dismissed earlier reports on the plan as “baseless”.\n\nArab and world leaders have rejected the idea of moving Gaza’s population to any country. Palestinians say that would be like another “Nakba” (catastrophe) when hundreds of thousands fled or were forced out during the Arab-Israeli war of 1948.\n\nGaza death toll rises\n\nThe UN human rights office said on Friday that at least 1,760 Palestinians had been killed while seeking aid since late May.\n\nThat marks a jump of several hundred from the 1,373 deaths it reported at the beginning of August.\n\n“Since May 27, and as of August 13, we have recorded that at least 1,760 Palestinians have been killed while seeking aid,” the agency’s office for the Palestinian territories said. It stated that most of the killings were committed by the Israeli military.\n\nAlso on Friday, Gaza’s civil defence agency said at least 23 people were killed by Israeli fire, including 12 who were waiting for humanitarian aid. The Israeli military said it was looking into the reports.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 16th, 2025",
