He said his sister, Kalsoom Bibi and other women had seen torture marks on the body of Samina.\n\nHe said he contacted the police emergency in Kot Adu and sought help. As he called the police, Amir Abbas and his children started hurling threats of dire consequences at him.\n\nAfter the Kot Adu police informed Ghulam Akhtar that the incident had happened in the jurisdiction of the Dhamial police station in Rawalpindi, the concerned police took legal action on his complaint. Samina’s body was transported to the District Headquarters (DHQ) Hospital Rawalpindi for postmortem.\n\nHe further alleged in the FIR that his son-in-law, along with his children, murdered his daughter.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 16th, 2025",
