  "content": "QUETTA: Pakistan Railways has restored train services from Quetta to other provinces on Friday, following a suspension caused by a recent bomb attack on the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express.\n\nThe train, which originated in Quetta, was targeted in the Spizend area of Dasht in Mastung district.\n\nAccording to officials, an explosive device planted along the railway track by unidentified militants detonated as Jaffar Express passed through the area last week, resulting in the derailment of six passenger coaches.\n\nWhile no casualties were reported in the incident, the blast caused significant damage to the track connecting Balochistan with the other three provinces.\n\nAccording to railway officials, amid tight security, the Jaffar Express departed from Quetta for Peshawar on Friday at its scheduled time.\n\nAlso, the Bolan Mail resumed service as the train left for Quetta from Karachi on Friday. Officials said the Bolan Mail would return to Karachi from Quetta on Saturday as per schedule.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 16th, 2025",
