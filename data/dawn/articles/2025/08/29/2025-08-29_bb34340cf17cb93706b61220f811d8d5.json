  "content": "LOWER DIR: Amid a surge in militant attacks and growing public anxiety over the worsening law and order situation in Dir, elders and political leaders of Lajbok have demanded of the government and security institutions to take immediate and decisive action against militants.\n\nThe demand came at an ‘amn jirga’ (peace council) held in Lajbook, Blambat tehsil here the other day, where speakers said that ensuring peace was the prime responsibility of the state and warned that residents would not abandon their homes under any circumstances.\n\nThe jirga was attended by leaders of major political parties, including ANP’s Mian Hazrat Hussain, former JI tehsil nazim Imranuddin advocate, PPP’s Subhanuddin advocate, Syed Munim Shah, Dr Wahid Zaman, Maulana Amanullah and others.\n\nThe participants said the people of Lajbook were peace-loving and patriotic citizens who had recently helped protect CTD police personnel during an operation by providing them safe passage, saving their lives. They strongly condemned militants for torching police vehicles and “maligning the peaceful image of the area”.\n\nThe jirga members criticised what they described as “dubious and inconsistent” government and security policies, noting that while security forces were deployed in Lajbook’s mountains last year, they were now absent despite militants having regrouped in the remote terrain.\n\nThey questioned how militants managed to reach the region unchecked, and why security institutions were not moving against them. The elders stressed that if the state demonstrated sincerity in restoring peace, the local people would stand shoulder to shoulder with the forces.\n\nThey also questioned how unarmed civilians could resist militants when the government had already withdrawn weapons from them.\n\nThe jirga formed a committee to pursue peace efforts in the area and warned against conspiracies aimed at destabilising Lower Dir.\n\nThe development comes after a series of militant attacks and clashes with security forces in Upper and Lower Dir over the past four days that left several policemen injured, causing widespread fear among local residents.\n\nHSSC RESULT: The Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) Malakand will announce the results of the annual intermediate first- and second-year examinations tomorrow (Aug 30).\n\nAccording to a press release issued by the board’s chairman and controller of examinations, Mohammad Naseem Khan, a ceremony to honour the top position holders would be held at 10am at the auditorium of the University of Malakand.\n\nThe statement said that the detailed marks certificates (DMCs) of regular students would be handed over to the heads of their respective colleges on September 1 from the board’s secrecy section against authority letters. Private candidates, however, would be able to collect their DMCs from their designated examination centres from the same date.\n\nCandidates with outstanding dues have been advised to clear their arrears at the board’s one-window section before receiving their certificates.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 29th, 2025",
