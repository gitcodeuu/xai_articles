There is no clean water to drink. I left my daughter at a relative’s place and stayed back, hoping the water recedes,” she said.\n\nLandslides and floods triggered by heavier-than-usual monsoon rains have killed more than 800 people nationwide since June this year.\n\nWhile South Asia’s seasonal monsoon brings rainfall that farmers depend on, climate change is making the phenomenon more erratic, unpredictable and deadly across the region.\n\nMore than 1.4 million people living near the rivers have been affected by the floods, with over 265,000 evacuated, said Azma Bukhari, the provincial information minister.\n\n“We just can’t get a break,” Amir Mehmood, a 32-year-old shopkeeper in the same neighbourhood as Bano, told AFP.\n\n“Children fall ill in the smog because of the extreme cold. Some become sick due to the (everyday) unsanitary conditions,” he said, referring to piles of waste that routinely line the streets.\n\n“And now there’s a flood. Our homes have collapsed, the walls have fallen, and everything is damaged.”\n\nHe moved his family to a relative’s home on the other side of the town along with his 10 cows and two goats as the water crept closer.\n\nMore than 300 relief camps have been set up across the province to shelter those displaced with no family to turn to.\n\n“The women you see here, and me, we had to run for our lives… we did not even get the time to get clothes for our kids,” 40-year-old widow Tabassum Suleman told AFP from the school camp.\n\n“We do not know when we will be going back home,” she said, looking up at the dark skies. “But the worst is yet to come.”\n\nHeader image: Evacuated residents from their submerged homes, take shelter at a government school after floodwaters entered from the overflowing Ravi river in Shahdara, Lahore on August 29. — AFP",
