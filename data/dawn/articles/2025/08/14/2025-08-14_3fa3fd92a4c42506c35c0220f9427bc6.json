  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A local court has vacated stay orders secured by the Higher Education Commission’s (HEC) Executive Director (ED) Dr Ziaul Qayyum against his termination.\n\nFollowing the order of an Additional District and Sessions Judge, Dr Qayyum is no longer serving as ED. The post of chairman HEC is also lying vacant after the completion of Dr Mukhtar’s tenure. Currently, the Secretary of Education is looking after the affairs of the HEC.\n\nWith Dr Qayyum’s departure, both key offices of the HEC will have no regular appointees.\n\nHowever, for the appointment of chairman, the Ministry of Education has already issued an advertisement and it is expected that the process will be completed in due course.\n\nThe HEC will also initiate the process for a fresh appointment of its ED.\n\nEarlier, on Aug 1, a court bailiff helped Dr Qayyum resume charge as ED of the HEC. He was removed by the HEC commission in May this year two years before the completion of his tenure, citing his “unsatisfactory” performance.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 14th, 2025",
