  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tan­veer Hussain on Wedne­sday expressed deep concern over the recent surge in di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) fertiliser prices and urged manufacturers to immediately lower rates to protect farmers and safeguard national food security.\n\nChairing a meeting of the fertiliser review committee, Mr Hussain warned that if companies failed to cooperate in ensuring fair and affordable prices, the government would explore and implement alternative measures to facilitate growers.\n\nHe noted that rising input costs had become a serious obstacle for farmers, particularly small-scale growers who form the backbone of the agriculture sector. Weakening purchasing power, he cautioned, would not only reduce productivity but also hurt the fertiliser industry itself.\n\nThe minister called on manufacturers to urgently review pricing structures, adopt cost-cutting measures and work with the government to bring DAP prices down to reasonable levels without compromising quality.\n\n“Availability of affordable and quality fertilisers is vital for improving yields, meeting domestic demand and ensuring food security,” he stressed.\n\nReiterating the government’s commitment to protecting farmers’ interests, he said no unjustified price hike would be allowed to undermine agricultural output. The fertiliser rev­i­ew committee was direc­ted to continue engagement with all stakeholders and present actionable recommendations within a week to stabilise the market and ensure uninterrupted supply nationwide.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 14th, 2025",
