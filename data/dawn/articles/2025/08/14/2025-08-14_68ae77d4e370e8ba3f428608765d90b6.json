  "content": "LARKANA: Over 60 activists of different nationalist parties announced quitting their organisations for good and joining mainstream national politics.\n\nLocal leaders of Jeay Sindh Muttahida Mahaz, Mir Salman Ali, Mohammad Urs, and Jeay Sindh Qaumi Mahaz-Arisar’s Aftab Ali and Mohammad Haseeb, along with more than 60 of their companions made the announcement at a press conference at Larkana Press Club on Wednesday, holding national flags in their hands.\n\nThey said the banned organisations had always pursued anti-state policies against the country, making them commit wrong acts. Sitting safely abroad, the leaders of the banned outfits were harming the country, they said.\n\nThey said that they were deceived and taught hatred against their own country and people. Such actions were gravely damaging the country’s honour, which made them realise that Pakistan was the best country in the world and that they should not work against their own nation, they said.\n\n“Therefore, finally we have jointly decided to hold the Pakistani flag in our hands, raise slogans of ‘Long Live Pakistan’ and ‘Long Live Pakistan Army’ and join the national mainstream,” they declared.\n\nIn recent war with India, soldiers of Pakistan Army and the nation stood shoulder to shoulder to defeat the enemy, which raised Pakistan’s respect in the comity of nations, they said.\n\nThey vowed that from that onwards, they would not have any connection with nationalist parties, and their life and death would be for their beloved homeland. They pledged to stand alongside Pakistan Army and play important role in defending their country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 14th, 2025",
