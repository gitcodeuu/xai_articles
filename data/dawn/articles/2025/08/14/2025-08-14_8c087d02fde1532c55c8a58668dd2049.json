  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday issued notices to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on petitions filed by Punjab Assembly’s former opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar and two other former lawmakers challenging their disqualification and to halt upcoming by-polls in their constituencies.\n\nJustice Khalid Ishaq heard the petitions as senior lawyer Shahzad Shaukat appeared on behalf of the petitioners.\n\nThe counsel argued that no proceedings can be initiated against a member of the assembly without a reference sent by the speaker. He pointed out that the lawmakers were disqualified without being given a chance to be heard, which violates the principles of natural justice.\n\nHe asked the court to reinstate the former lawmakers’ membership and set aside the notifications issued for the by-election schedule in their constituencies.\n\nA deputy attorney general told the court that the by-polls had not been announced in the constituencies.\n\nThe petitioner’s counsel asked the court to refer the matter to the ECP after suspending the disqualification of the petitioners.\n\nHowever, Justice Ishaq observed that the stay order cannot be issued without hearing the other side.\n\nOther petitioners are Muhammad Ahmad Chatha and Junaid Afzal Sahi.\n\nAfter hearing initial arguments, the judge issued notices to the ECP and the federal government for submission of replies by Aug 18.\n\nThe ECP disqualified these petitioners following their conviction in May 9 cases by the anti-terrorism courts of Sargodha and Faisalabad. The trial court awarded them 10-year rigorous imprisonment each.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 14th, 2025",
