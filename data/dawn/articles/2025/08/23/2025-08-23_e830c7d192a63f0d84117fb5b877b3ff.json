Section 138 of the Elections Act also requires the ECP to publish these declarations in the official gazette.\n\nThe National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Parliamentary Affairs, which met under the chairmanship of Rana Iradat Sharif Khan, considered the bill introduced by Shazia Marri and Syed Naveed Qamar.\n\nThe proposed amendment to Section 138 seeks to insert a proviso stating: “Provided that the extent of disclosure, under this section, shall give due regard to the balance between public interest for good governance and an individual’s privacy and security. Provided further that the extent to which the first proviso shall apply will be determined by the Speaker of the concerned Assembly and, in the case of the Senate, by the Chairman.”\n\nAccording to the statement of objects and reasons, the amendment aims to strike a balance between transparency and the protection of individual rights.\n\nIt states: “While the publication of statements of assets and liabilities serves a vital role in promoting public accountability, enhancing trust in public office, and ensuring good governance, it is recognised that unrestricted or excessive disclosure could potentially compromise the personal security and privacy of parliamentarians and their families.”\n\nDuring the proceedings, Mr Qamar referred to the recently passed amendment to the Civil Servants Act, which requires civil servants in grades 17 to 22 to disclose all domestic and foreign assets, including those of their spouses and dependent children.\n\nHe pointed out that civil servants can approach their heads of departments if they believe disclosure of their assets could pose a security threat. He argued that similar relief should also be available to lawmakers.\n\nThe committee was also apprised that National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) was expanding its operational capacity. The agency has also enhanced coordination with the PTA to curb the misuse of illegal SIMs. It also raised concerns over financial crimes, fraudulent activities targeting the BISP.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
