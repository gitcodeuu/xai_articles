A new meeting will take place next week on this issue,” he added.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on X that his country remained “committed to diplomacy but time is very short”.\n\n“Iran needs to engage substantively in order to avoid the activation of snapback,” he said. “We have been clear that we will not let the snapback of sanctions expire unless there is a verifiable and durable deal.”\n\nThe EU’s foreign policy chief, Kaja Kallas, made a similar statement. “With the deadline for the snapback mechanism fast approaching, Iran’s readiness to engage with the US is crucial. Iran must also fully cooperate” with the IAEA, she said.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where the talks, the second since the Iran-Israel war, would take place.\n\nSnapback ‘consequences’\n\nIran and the European trio — known as the E3 — held talks in late July at the Iranian consulate in Istanbul, which Tehran described as “frank”.\n\nIran’s 12-day war with Israel derailed its nuclear negotiations with the United States and saw it suspend cooperation with the IAEA.\n\nThe 2015 nuclear deal was aimed preventing Iran from developing an atomic bomb — an ambition it has consistently denied.\n\nThe deal was torpedoed in 2018 when Donald Trump, during his first term as US president, unilaterally withdrew the United States from the agreement and slapped crippling sanctions on its economy.\n\nIran has ever since criticised Europe over failing to meet its commitments under the deal.\n\nAraghchi reiterated on Friday the “lack of legal and moral competence of these countries to resort to the said mechanism” while warning about “the consequences of such an action”.\n\nIran has previously said it would leave the non-proliferation treaty — or NPT — if the mechanism, envisaged in the nuclear deal, is activated by the European parties.\n\nThe deadline for activating the mechanism ends in October, though Europeans have set an internal target of the end of August to trigger it if diplomacy fails. They have also offered an extension to buy time for talks.\n\nAraghchi said that “this is a decision that must essentially be taken by the United Nations Security Council; and while the Islamic Republic of Iran has its own principled positions and views in this regard, it is not involved in this process.”\n\nThe foreign minister said earlier this month that Iran was working with China and Russia to prevent the snapback of sanctions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
