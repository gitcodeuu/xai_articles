And I’m sure it’ll work out in Tokyo.”\n\nFraser-Pryce made her senior debut at the 2007 world champs in the Japanese city of Osaka, a life-changing experience which she recalls well.\n\n“I was just really unsure of who I was. I didn’t want to run, I just wanted to enjoy the moment, and then I was placed on the 4x100m team through an anchor leg,” she said.\n\n“It really transformed the way I think. I went back home and I worked really hard, and then that just changed the rest of history for me.”\n\nThe Tokyo worlds are only three weeks away and Fraser-Pryce said there was not enough time for a major overhaul.\n\n“There’s not much you can really do more than just fine tuning the things that you’ve been doing and continue to work on those things, and trust that everything will fall into place,” she said.\n\n“I haven’t been racing a lot. The start is something that I’m working on. So hopefully I’ll be able to get it together.\n\n“I’m experienced enough to know that I have to focus on my own lane with my own race.\n\n“We all have different goals and different expectations when we go into a race and what we’re working on. So I kind of just focus on what I have to do and then see if I do that, and then go back to the drawing board and work on it.”\n\nFraser-Pryce said that, on paper, Jefferson-Wooden “would definitely be the favourite to win” in Tokyo.\n\n“But you have to run the race. That’s just how it is,” she added.\n\nThe American, however, was not the Jamaican’s main concern.\n\n“My focus is to run my race and to focus on what my goals are, and hopefully all these races that I’ve been able to do will help me to put the race together.\n\n“I already know who I am. I know who I am, know what I’m about.\n\n“I already have a championship mindset, so I’m looking at and working on those experiences to help me go through the championships. “",
