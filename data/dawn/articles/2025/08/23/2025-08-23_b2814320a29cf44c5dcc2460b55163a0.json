  "content": "LAHORE: The six-member Coaching Affairs Committee formed by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) last month to interview and recommend new coaches has seen little involvement from its designated members, with only one actively carrying out the task alongside officials not part of the committee.\n\nThe committee — announced on July 16 — includes Director High Performance Aqib Javed, Director Domestic Abdullah Khurram Niazi, Director HR and Administration Abdul Faisal Malik, Pakistan men’s head coach Mike Hesson, Head of Coaching Education Shahid Aslam, and GM Academies Imran Abbas.\n\nHowever, sources told Dawn that only Shahid Aslam has been conducting interviews, joined by GM Domestic Junaid Zia, who is not part of the committee. The pair first travelled to Karachi and are currently in Rawalpindi to continue the process. Another official from the local station — also not on the committee — has been involved at both venues.\n\nAccording to the PCB’s notification, the committee’s mandate is to shortlist suitable candidates for coaching roles, conduct interviews, recommend appointments and deployment across programs, and ensure alignment with the board’s coaching structure, policies, and compliance protocols.\n\nThe notification further stated that the committee’s formation would “contribute significantly to enhancing transparency, professionalism, and consistency across all coaching-related operations” while serving as “an essential support mechanism for the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in achieving its long-term developmental goals.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
