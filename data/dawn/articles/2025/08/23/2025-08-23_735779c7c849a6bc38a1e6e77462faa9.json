Showing incredible grit, Faizan was still attempting to fight on despite the severe injury. He was immediately rushed to a local hospital, where he was reported to be in stable condition.\n\nIn other fights of the tournament, Punjab’s young gun Nehal Khan overcame Hamid Rehman of KP in a strawweight (52.2kg) bout. In the flyweight division, Nazar (Punjab) defeated Baz Mohammad (Sindh) and Abdul Rehman of Balochistan overpowered Punjab’s Mohammad Ali to complete the semi-final line-up.\n\nThe bantamweight (61.2kg) category saw both Islamabad’s Samiullah and Sadiqullah both advance, while KP’s Ihsanullah registered a victory via technical knockout (TKO) over Muneeb Mir.\n\nSindh fighters dominated the featherweight category, with Musavir Shah and Hussain Malik registering commanding wins over Shehroz and Mohammad Rashid, both from Punjab. Tanzil of KP booked the last semi-final spot with a win over Zubair Shah of Balochistan.\n\nThe action continued in the welterweight (77.1kg) division where Sindh’s Asif Khan overwhelmed Rozi Khan of Balochistan and Zaib Hasan of Punjab downed Saad Khan of KP.
