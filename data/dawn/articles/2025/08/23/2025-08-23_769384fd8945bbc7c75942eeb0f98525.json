  "content": "ISLAMABAD: An honour killing case on Friday took a new turn when a father accused his son of murdering his daughter in Shams Colony police area.\n\nInitially, both the father and son were arrested for the crime, but the father has since registered a case against his son, claiming he was the one who committed the murder in the name of honor. The case was registered under section 302 (murder).\n\nThe police said, the man a resident of Islamabad told police that the incident took place on Thursday when his 20-year-old daughter was in the house. His son, brother of the girl, shot her in the head with a firearm.\n\nThe father claimed his daughter’s desire to marry a man of her choice led to frequent arguments at home, which apparently strained her relationship with his son. This family conflict reportedly played a role in the tragic events that unfolded.\n\nHis son had unjustly killed his sister in the name of honour in a very brutal manner, he told the police. In his statement the man requested the police to take action against his son and bring him to justice.\n\nThe police said that the blood soaked body of the girl was found on the bed upon arrival at the house. She died on the spot after sustaining the bullet injury.\n\nThe accused escaped from the spot after killing his sister along with the murder weapon, the police said.\n\nA police officer said that efforts are in progress to trace and arrest the accused, nominated by his father.\n\nThe preliminary investigations revealed that the girl eloped with the boy 20 days ago and wanted to tie the knot with him. Her mother also accompanied her.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
