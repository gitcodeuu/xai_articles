Gilgit-Bal­t­istan Secretary Fida Hussain explained that a gla­cial lake had formed above Tildas and Rawshan villages. The high temperatures led to the burst of the lake, causing a flash flood in Sado Nallah on Wednesday night.\n\nA shepherd, Wasiyat Khan from Rawshan village, who was near the glacier, used his mobile phone to alert the community about the impending flood. His warning gave villagers enough time to evacuate and local volunteers swiftly moved residents to safer locations.\n\nMr Hussain confirmed that although the flood swept through the downstream areas of Tildas and Rawshan, no casualties were reported. However, around 40 people were initially stranded in the floodwaters on Friday morning. The Pakistan Army was called for a helicopter rescue, but by the time the helicopters arrived, local volunteers had already managed to rescue the stranded individuals. All affected residents are reported to be safe.\n\nLocal sources said that the flood devastated approximately 80 per cent of Tildas village, displacing 65 households and washing away homes, land, infrastructure and personal belongings. The floodwaters also blocked the Ghizer River for six hours, creating an artificial lake and submerging homes, farmland, bridges and trees in nearby villages.\n\nAccording to a local administration report, the flood affected over 330 households across six villages — Tildas, Raushan, Hakis, Gawat and Molaabad — after the river was blocked. The report highlights that of the 906 houses in these villages, 330 were severely damaged, leaving these families in dire need of emergency assistance.\n\nPublic infrastructure was also submerged, including a mosque, a school, a Jamat Khana and an RCC bridge on the Gilgit-Ghizer Road. The artificial lake on the Ghizer River submerged parts of the Gilgit-Shandur Road, cutting off access to the upper Gupis, Phander and Yasin regions.\n\nAccording to Rescue 1122, some 200 people were rescued from the flood-affected areas and relocated to the Yangal and Samal areas of Ghizer. The rescue teams also provided medical assistance to those traumatised by the destruction of their homes.\n\nDisplaced families, who fled with little more than the clothes on their backs, are now in urgent need of shelter, food and medical supplies. The local administration has said that while water has begun to recede from the artificial lake, the risk to downstream settlements persists.\n\nGB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan and cabinet members visited the affected areas in Ghizer and announced the immediate rehabilitation of damaged infrastructure, including bridges, power supply lines, drinking water and irrigation channels.\n\nThe chief minister also directed the home secretary and the director general of the GB Disaster Management Authority to assist in the rescue efforts and ensure the safety of the affected populations.\n\nIn recognition of the heroic actions of the shepherd, Wasiyat Khan, the GB police department issued an official commendation certificate.\n\nHis timely alert saved several lives, and local communities and officials alike have hailed him as a hero.\n\nGhizer Valley has been severely affected by flooding this year. On Aug 14, the region was struck by multiple floods, resulting in 13 deaths, several injuries and widespread displacement across the Ghalti, Ishkoman, Gupis, Yasin, Daen and Chaturkhand areas.\n\nThese disasters occurred without early warning systems in place, which could have saved lives and property.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
