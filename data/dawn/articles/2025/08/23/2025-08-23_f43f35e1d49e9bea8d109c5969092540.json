Just in August, there have been at least 138 deaths, including 25 minors, the ministry said on Friday.\n\nThe IPC said the famine in Gaza was “entirely man-made”, driven by a sharp escalation of the conflict in July, massive displacement of people since mid-March and restricted access to food.\n\nIn early March, Israel completely banned aid supplies from Gaza, before allowing very limited quantities to enter at the end of May, leading to severe shortages of food, medicine and fuel.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Geneva, Fletcher said the famine should “haunt us all”.\n\n“It is a famine that we could have prevented if we had been allowed. Yet food stacks up at borders because of systematic obstruction by Israel,” he said.\n\nUN rights chief Volker Turk said “it is a war crime to use starvation as a method of warfare”.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres renewed calls for an immediate ceasefire and full humanitarian access to Gaza, adding: “We cannot allow this situation to continue with impunity.”\n\nThe International Red Cross described the declaration of famine as “devastating and entirely foreseeable”.\n\n“Under international humanitarian law, Israel, as the occupying power, must ensure that the basic needs of the civilian population in Gaza are met,” it said in a statement.\n\nOutrage\n\nHamas called on Friday for an immediate end to the war in Gaza and the lifting of the Israeli siege on the territory.\n\nIn a statement published online, the group called for “immediate action by the UN and the security council to stop the war and lift the siege” and demanded that crossings be opened “without restrictions to allow the urgent and continuous entry of food, medicine, water and fuel”.\n\nIt said the declaration by the UN confirmed the “humanitarian catastrophe” in Gaza — but lamented that it came far too late.\n\nBritain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy on Friday condemned the famine in Gaza as a “moral outrage” and a “man-made catastrophe”.\n\nCalling it “utterly horrifying and wholly preventable”, he called on Israel to take urgent action to remedy the situation.\n\n“We are seeing the worst possible humanitarian catastrophe that we can even measure,” said Jeanette Bailey, a child nutrition lead at the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based aid organisation.\n\n‘Too weak to cry’\n\nIn July alone, more than 12,000 children were identified as acutely malnourished – a six-fold increase since January, according to UN agencies.\n\n“The signs were unmistakable: children with wasted bodies, too weak to cry or eat, babies dying from hunger and preventable disease,” said Unicef Executive Director Catherine Russell.\n\nThe local food system has collapsed, with an estimated 98pc of cropland in the Gaza Strip either damaged, inaccessible or both, the IPC said.\n\nMeanwhile, livestock is decimated and fishing is banned.\n\nThe IPC said conditions in the North Gaza Governorate, north of Gaza City, may well be worse, but said it did not have enough data.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
