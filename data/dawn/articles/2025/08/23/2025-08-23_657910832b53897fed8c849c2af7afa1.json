  "content": "RAWALPINDI: A joint sub-committee of police and intelligence officers (JSC) has mapped over 15,000 Afghan nationals with Proof of Registration (PoR) cards as part of the government’s repatriation strategy for illegal foreigners.\n\nThe Haji Camp at Golra Mor, Rawalpindi, has been designated as a temporary holding centre for Afghan nationals, as law enforcement agencies prepare to launch a crackdown when the formal repatriation and deportation process takes effect from September 1, 2025, a senior police official said.\n\nHe said that the mapping of more than 15,000 Afghan nationals with PoR cards has been completed so far, while the total number of Afghan nationals with PoR cards stands at 46,000.\n\nA crackdown will begin after September 1, 2025, in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad to repatriate them, he added.\n\nIt has also been decided that the voluntary return of PoR card holders shall commence immediately, while the formal repatriation and deportation process will begin from September 1, 2025.\n\nAs part of the illegal foreigner repatriation strategy, JSC was formed to map Afghan nationals with PoR cards and assist operational teams.\n\nThe JSC comprises the district officer Special Branch Rawalpindi, deputy superintendent of police (Security) Rawalpindi, a representative of the Ministry of SAFRON, and representatives of the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD), Intelligence Bureau and other intelligence agencies.\n\nThe committee was tasked with ensuring the mapping of PoR card holders provided by representatives of the Ministry of SAFRON through their respective field formations. Real-time information about the location of illegal foreigners is to be shared with the police for the implementation of the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan (IFRP).\n\nThe government has already chalked out a comprehensive strategy to expedite the formal repatriation of Afghan nationals holding PoR cards as part of the ongoing implementation of the IFRP.\n\nAs part of the strategy, the chief secretaries and inspectors general of police of the four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan, the director of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), the chief commissioner Islamabad, and other authorities concerned have been informed that the voluntary return of PoR card holders should be carried out without delay.\n\nThe repatriation of illegal foreign nationals, including Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, will continue as per the earlier decision under the IFRP. More than 24 illegal Afghans have already been detained by police in Rawalpindi, a police official said.\n\nThe decision was taken at a meeting held in the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control, Islamabad, earlier this month.\n\nIt was decided to convey to the concerned authorities that Afghan nationals holding PoR cards shall be repatriated to Afghanistan as part of the ongoing implementation of the IFRP.\n\nAs part of the plan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will engage with the Interim Afghan Government (IAG), UNHCR and the international community, if needed. Likewise, the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and SAFRON will provide the database of PoR cards to the respective provincial, divisional, and district committees.\n\nIt was also decided that NADRA will make arrangements for the deregistration of returnees at transit areas and border terminals, along with providing the requisite capacity at border terminals. All provincial governments and relevant agencies have been directed to ensure the mapping of all PoR card holders, devise provincial action plans, and share them with the Ministry of Interior.\n\nAll provincial governments and relevant agencies will designate transit areas for the stay of deportees and arrange for their transportation and financial requirements. Likewise, provincial governments will operationalise provincial, divisional and district-level implementation committees to review and suggest adjustments in the repatriation process.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
