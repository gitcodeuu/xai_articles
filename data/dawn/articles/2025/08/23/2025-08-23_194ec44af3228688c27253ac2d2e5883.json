He was rushed to hospital and underwent emergency surgery, and is still in intensive care.\n\nThe JBF, which oversees amateur boxing in Japan, said the man had not fought a match for over 10 years and had been in training to make a comeback.\n\n“We are praying he recovers as quickly as possible,” said JBF president Tatsuya Nakama.\n\nJapanese boxing is under the spotlight after super featherweight Shigetoshi Kotari and lightweight Hiromasa Urakawa, both 28, died days after injuries sustained in separate bouts in Tokyo on Aug 2.\n\nJapanese boxing officials have held a series of emergency meetings and vowed to introduce new safety rules.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
