Now we don’t know whether we can continue working.”\n\nKhalid, who attends a community college in northern Virginia, added, “Almost all foreign students are scared. We don’t know whether we can work, drive, or even go out. This is not the America that we dreamed of.”\n\nThose living in the US under political asylum face even greater concerns.\n\nThe Pakistani embassy in Washington estimates that between 700,000 to a million Pakistanis live in the United States, most as citizens or long-term residents. Many do not register officially, so exact numbers are unclear.\n\nAccording to the latest Open Doors report by the Institute of International Education, the United States hosted 1,126,690 international students in 2024, up 7 per cent from the previous year.\n\nPakistan sent 10,988 students in 2024, compared to 17,099 from Bangladesh and 16,742 from Nepal. India topped the list with 331,602 students.\n\nThe Pakistani embassy estimates that the number of Pakistani students has risen to about 12,500 in 2025, still far below other South Asian countries.\n\nAs part of the broader vetting process, US authorities are reviewing social media activity for any signs of hostility toward US citizens, culture, government, or institutions.\n\nOfficials have also been instructed to monitor for support of designated foreign terrorists or engagement in antisemitic harassment or violence.\n\nMatthew Tragesser, a spokesperson for US Citizenship and Immigration Services, stated, “America’s benefits should not be given to those who despise the country and promote anti-American ideologies.”\n\nIn addition, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a pause in the issuance of worker visas for truck drivers, citing safety concerns and the impact on American livelihoods.\n\nVisa holders from Malawi and Zambia are now required to pay a $15,000 deposit for tourist or business visas, while travel bans remain in effect for 12 countries, with partial restrictions on seven more.\n\nThe crackdown has left Pakistani students and visa holders anxious about their future.\n\nPakistani authorities in Washington continue to receive queries from students and other visa holders and forward them to the US State Department. Embassy officials are closely monitoring the situation, emphasising the importance of legal documentation, awareness of rights, and caution in political activity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 23rd, 2025",
