  "content": "LAHORE: The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Friday expressed deep concern over the ECP’s decision to disqualify several opposition leaders and lawmakers, including National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan and Senate Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz, following their convictions in connection with the May 9, 2023, riots.\n\n“While HRCP consistently condemns violence, vandalism of public property and attacks on state installations — whether pertaining to the May 9 riots or when carried out at any time by any other group — it is equally concerned that due process and fair trial guarantees under the Constitution must be scrupulously upheld,” the statement said.\n\nReports of mass trials, including by military courts, sweeping convictions, and lengthy prison sentences raise serious questions about the impartiality and transparency of proceedings, it noted.\n\nIt said that the right to political participation is a cornerstone of any democracy.\n\n“Disqualifying elected representatives under Article 63(1)(h) must not be used in a manner that undermines political pluralism or silences dissent,” the commission said.\n\nHRCP urges the judiciary to ensure that appeals are heard fairly and without delay, and calls on the state to ensure that political competition is resolved through democratic means, not by curtailing civic and political space.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
