  "content": "QUETTA: Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) has successfully thwarted a cybercrime attempt targeting its IT infrastructure through a ransomware attack.\n\nA PPL spokesperson said the attack occurred on August 6, prompting the immediate activation of the company’s internal cybersecurity protocols.\n\nHe said PPL’s IT and cybersecurity teams, in coordination with external experts, took swift and effective preventive measures to contain the threat. These included the temporary suspension of selec­ted non-critical services to ensure the integrity of IT systems and minimise any potential impact.\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, PPL operates a mu­lti-layered cybersecurity framework, which enabled the company to quick­­ly neutralise the threat. So far, no evidence has been found of any sensitive or business-critical data being compromised. The company’s core operational systems remain ful­ly secure, and all partners, including joint venture associates, continue their activities without disruption.\n\nThe spokesperson confirmed that a ransom note was received from the attacker, who identified himself as “Blue Locker”.\n\nIn line with best business practices and legal guidelines, the matter has been reported to the relevant law enforcement and regulatory authorities. Investigations are underway in collaboration with these agencies.\n\nPPL has also initiated a comprehensive forensic analysis to assess the scope of the incident and to further strengthen its cyber defence capabilities. “We are committed to complete transparency and to restoring full system functionality in a safe and phased manner,” the spokesperson said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
