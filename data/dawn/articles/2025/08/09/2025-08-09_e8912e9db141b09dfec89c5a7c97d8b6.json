The common citizen feels there’s no future left in Pakistan.”\n\nHe noted that mafias operate with state protection, 84 of 89 sugar mills were owned by ruling families, and the judicial system had been crippled through the 26th Constitutional Amendment.\n\n“Those who are themselves disqualified are handing out disqualification certificates,” he said, calling the amendment’s architects criminals in the eyes of the people and history.\n\nMr Rehman also criticised the class-based education system, lack of employment opportunities for youth, and poor working conditions for labourers. He highlighted that less than 10pc of the country’s 80m workers enjoyed basic rights.\n\n“Programmes like Benazir Income Support are being used for political gain,” he added and stressed the lack of safety and dignity for working women and the need for revolutionary reforms in the agricultural sector, predicting that IT exports could rise from $3/4bn to $15bn with the right policies.\n\nThe JI leader vowed that the voices of oppressed people from Sindh, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would echo from Minar-e-Pakistan.\n\n“We will represent the victims of dacoits in Sindh, the oppressed in Balochistan, and those affected by unrest in KP,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
