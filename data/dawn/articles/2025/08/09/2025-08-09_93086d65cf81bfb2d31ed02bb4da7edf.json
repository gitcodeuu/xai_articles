  "content": "LONDON: Evann Guessand said he “didn’t think twice” when offered the chance to sign for Aston Villa after completing a move from Nice on Friday.\n\nThe Ivory Coast forward will reportedly cost Villa an initial 26 million ($35 million) with a further 4.3 million in add-ons.\n\nGuessand scored 13 goals and registered 10 assists in all competitions as Nice finished fourth in Ligue 1 last season.\n\nThe 24-year-old bolsters Villa’s attacking options after the sale of Jhon Dur­an in January to Al-Nassr and the departures of loanees Marcus Rashford and Marco Asensio.\n\n“When I heard the club wanted me I didn’t think twice,” Guessand said. “I’m ready to give my all. Every game, every kick, every minute.”\n\nGuessand graduated from Nice’s youth system and made his senior debut in 2020. He went on loan to Swiss club Lausanne-Sport and French side Nantes before having his best season yet in 2024-25.\n\nHe also scored his first goal for Ivory Coast in March in a 1-0 win over Burundi in the World Cup qualifiers.\n\nUnai Emery’s men, who finished sixth in the Pre­mier League last season, begin their campaign at home to Newcastle next weekend.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
