The committee will be empowered to oversee and recommend MPAs’ salaries and allowances, with its recommendations binding on the government.\n\nUnder the newly passed bill, key provisions include a consolidated salary for an MPA as determined by the committee, alongside a range of allowances such as sumptuary, house rent, utilities, daily, conveyance, subsidy, accommodation, and travelling and mileage allowances.\n\nAdditionally, the Leader of Opposition will receive a salary, allowances, and privileges equivalent to those of a Provincial Minister.\n\nChairpersons of various parliamentary committees will be eligible for multiple allowances but are limited to using one government vehicle during their tenure, with petrol and maintenance allowances provided.\n\nThey must return the vehicle within three days of leaving office.\n\nMeanwhile, lone Jamaat-i-Islami MPA Muhammad Farooq, who is in Saudi Arabia and not part of the PA proceedings, told Dawn his partywas against the increase in lawmakers’ salary as it would be a burden on the provincial exchequer.\n\nHe said that the current salary of an MPA is Rs152,000 and after the passage of this bill it would become Rs575,000.\n\nBureaucrats can head educational boards\n\nDuring the session, the parliamentary affairs minister also presented the Sindh Boards of Intermediate and Secondary Education (Amendment) Bill 2025 and the Anti-Terrorism Sindh (Amendment) Bill 2025, both approved by a majority vote.\n\nRegarding the education boards amendment, Mr Lanjar explained that the original 1972 ordinance equated the board chairman’s post to grades 20 and 21, but the new bill allows officers of grades 19 and 20 to be appointed as chairmen of boards.\n\nThe minister said that the bill is aimed at paving the way for more officers to be appointed in the education boards.\n\nMuttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Qaimkhani supported the need for better board management but criticised what he called the lack of “consideration” for his party’s suggestions.\n\nThe MQM-P lawmaker proposed sending the bill back to the committee for further discussion, a suggestion Lanjar opposed.\n\nThe speaker put it to a vote, and the house approved the bill by majority of votes.\n\nEarlier, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon praised police force for safeguarding law and order, and protecting life and property of citizens.\n\nSpeaking during the session, Mr Memon addressed the long-standing criticism and ridicule faced by the police.\n\n“When we seek a target for blame, the police are an easy choice,” he remarked. “Yet, we rarely reflect on the constable who endangers his life daily for a modest wage, only to face criticism instead of appreciation.”\n\nHe praised the Sindh Police for their “exemplary service” since 2008, noting their “historic success in restoring peace” under a democratic government.\n\nHe said once-dangerous areas, where residents avoided venturing out after dark, have now returned to normalcy, crediting the force’s efforts.\n\nHe lauded their courage in tackling terrorism, citing the Karachi airport attack where then-Inspector General Iqbal Mahmood led the response in plain clothes.\n\nLater, the house was adjourned to Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
