  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan Food Authority (BFA) on Friday confiscated a large consignment comprising thousands of packets of fake and substandard spices that were being sold under the name of a well-known national brand, officials said.\n\nThe operation, which targeted two wholesale traders in the New Adda and Satellite Town areas of Quetta, was launched following a tip about counterfeit food items.\n\nOfficials said the packaging, labelling and branding of the seized packets so closely mimicked the popular brand that it was extremely difficult for the average consumer to distinguish the counterfeit products from the authentic ones.\n\n“These fake spices were being illegally transported to Quetta from other provinces and supplied to various small and big cities of the province,” said Muhammad Riaz Nasir, director of operations for the BFA.\n\nBoth wholesale businesses were immediately sealed for serious legal violations and for endangering consumer health, Mr Nasir said.\n\nHe added that the investigation has been intensified to trace the main suppliers and distributors within the network.\n\nDirector General BFA Waqar Khurshid Alam said individuals involved in the fraudulent food business would face strict consequences.\n\n“Elements involved in the business of fake and substandard food items would not deserve any concession,” Mr Alam said, adding that “indiscriminate actions would continue to ensure the supply of quality and safe food in the province.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
