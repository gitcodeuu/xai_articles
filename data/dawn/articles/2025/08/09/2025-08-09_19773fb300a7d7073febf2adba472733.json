  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The city managers on Friday decided to scrap the bidding process for the widening of the loops of Faizabad Interchange and instead go for a new tender focusing on the expansion of the entire interchange.\n\nThe Capital Development Authority (CDA) had recently invited the tender for the widening of the loops of interchange which divides the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad.\n\nThe interchange, which was built in the 90s, connects the twin cities and serves as the main entry point to Islamabad besides being a central point for protest demonstrations.\n\nThe total estimated cost of the project was around Rs200 million. Subsequently, construction companies submitted their bids, which had been opened. However, the CDA decided not to issue the work order, saying expansion of the loops was not the solution.\n\nCivic body to float tenders afresh\n\nA meeting presided over by CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa decided to go for the complete designing of the entire interchange.\n\n“Yes, today I directed the engineering wing to go for permanent solution of problem [Faizabad] instead of temporary arrangement of widening of loops,” said the CDA chairman.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, after the meeting, he said three consultant firms had been asked to prepare master planning/designing of the entire project. “Once designs are prepared, we will place them before the interior minister,” he said.\n\n“Temporary work is not a solution. We want to have a complete solution of the problem for the next three decades and so,” added CDA member engineering Syed Nafasat Raza.\n\n“Today, the chairman gave us the go-ahead for designing of the entire project.” He said that hopefully in a few weeks, the design of the entire project will be prepared and then CDA will go for construction in phases.\n\n“Once we have the design of the entire project we will go for tendering process in accordance with available budget. But we will follow the design to resolve traffic congestion,” he said.\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi in April this year had directed the CDA to resolve traffic congestion issue at Faizabad Interchange, where people suffered daily, particularly on the loop which connects Murree Road with the Expressway.\n\nMeanwhile, an engineer of the CDA said Faizabad Interchange was built in the 90s when the traffic count was very less.\n\n“Now, this interchange faces traffic congestion particularly in the loop which moves towards Lahore,” he said and added that around 24,000 vehicles use the loop daily, while traffic count on the highway was 1,50,000. Similarly, 12,000 vehicles move towards Rawalpindi daily.\n\nThe current management of CDA has already launched two mega projects — Jinnah Square and F-8 Interchange — while three other mega projects — a flyover at the junction of GT Road and the Expressway, Shaheen Chowk underpass and a road to link Margalla Road with Peshawar Motorway (MI).\n\n“Technical bids of Shaheen Chowk and GT Road flyover have been opened and in the next few days financial bids will be opened before issuance of the work order. Soon, tender will also be called for Margalla Road,” said another engineer of CDA, adding that this month work on both these two projects will be formally started.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
