Once identified, such material is labelled and disseminated as fake,” he explained.\n\nHowever, he emphasised that this alone was not sufficient and that national cohesion was necessary to effectively counter the issue.\n\nHe, however, said this single step was not enough and a national cohesion was required to effectively deal with the issue. “It would be falsehood to claim we have brought about a revolution”, he remarked.\n\nThe information minister then proposed formation of a special house committee to make recommendations on how to counter misinformation and disinformation.\n\n“I invite the opposition to join and help the government on the issue. “If the committee is able to come up with practicable recommendations, the credit will go to this House— and to you”, he said while addressing National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq.\n\nThe Speaker, however, suggested that the matter be taken up by the information committee and noted that all interested members were welcome to join.\n\n‘Land travel ban temporary’\n\nMeanwhile, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar stated that the ban on land travel for pilgrimage to Iran and Iraq was a temporary measure.\n\nHe further said the spike in terrorism had necessitated the ban, which he said would be lifted in a ‘few days’ once the law and order situation improves.\n\nHe also told the House that arrangements were being made to facilitate those who had already reached the border.\n\nHe further said that the state minister for interior will make a comprehensive statement on the issue in the House on Monday.\n\nEight lawmakers disqualified\n\nEarlier, the session started with an annou­ncement by the Speaker about the disqualification of eight members of the House, including Opposition Leader Omar Ayub Khan.\n\nThe Speaker refused to give the floor to the opposition lawmakers who wanted to speak after the announcement, saying points of order were not allowed before question hour.\n\nA PTI lawmaker raised the issue of illegal confinement of members of a family, including women and children in Karachi. He said he had received a call from a woman who claimed that Head Constable Nabi Gul was murdered in 2021 and that his son avenged his death.\n\nFollowing this, several family members, including the mother, widowed sister and two children, were allegedly picked up and had been held in illegal confinement for a week.\n\n“In the name of humanity, I urge PPP and other stakeholders to help secure their release”, the PTI lawmaker appealed.\n\nSpeaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, acknowledging the seriousness of the matter as a human rights concern, requested PPP leader Syed Naveed Qamar to raise the issue with the Sindh government.\n\nLater, proceedings had to be adjourned after quorum was pointed out and it was determined the House was not in order.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 9th, 2025",
