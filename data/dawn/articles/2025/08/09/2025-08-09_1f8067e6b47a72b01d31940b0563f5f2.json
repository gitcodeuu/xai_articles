The police also recovered a firearm.\n\nThe shooting took place at around 1:20am ET (10:20am PKT) and followed a verbal altercation with one of the victims, the NYPD added. It said it was not known at this time whether the shooter or the victims knew each other.\n\nMass shootings are relatively common in the United States, where guns are widely available.\n\nThe incident at one of New York’s most iconic tourist spots comes after July’s high-profile shooting in a Manhattan office tower, which left four people dead, including a senior Blackstone executive and an NYPD officer.\n\nNew York experienced record-low shooting incidents and victims in the first seven months of this year, and in July, according to a statement published by the city’s police department on August 4.\n\nCrime is a key electoral issue for America’s largest city, which is set to hold mayoral elections in November.",
