Farooq, director research at Chase Securities, said a relatively tight monetary and fiscal policy over the past year has led to a “sharp decline in inflation”.\n\n“A comfortable current account balance, a stable currency, and softer commodity prices have also contributed to the disinflation trend,” Farooq said.\n\nHe said that as long as Pakistan remained under the programme with the International Monetary Fund, the government was expected to maintain fiscal discipline and avoid overspending, supporting continued price stability.\n\n“While interest rates are expected to decline, the pace of easing is likely to be gradual, with the central bank expected to remain cautious, prioritising reserve accumulation,” he said.",
