  "content": "LAHORE: Punjab Senior Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb has said any attempt to cross Pakistan’s borders will prove to be a historic blunder.\n\nIn a statement issued here on Thursday, she said the entire nation stood united like a rock with its brave armed forces and warned India against any miscalculation.\n\n“If aggression is initiated [by India], it will be met with a fierce and fitting response,” she asserted.\n\nThe minister also expressed solidarity with the families of the Pahalgam terror attack victims, saying that Pakistan is advocating for justice for them, while the Indian government is politicising the blood of its own citizens.\n\nShe further said that not only Pakistan, but friendly nations and the international community also recognised that India was the greatest threat to peace and a known supporter of terrorism.\n\nReiterating Pakistan’s commitment to peace, Ms Aurangzeb said: “Pakistan is a peace-loving country and advocates for harmony, but if war is imposed, India will be responsible for the consequences. We are fully prepared to shatter the arrogance of our enemy.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 2nd, 2025",
