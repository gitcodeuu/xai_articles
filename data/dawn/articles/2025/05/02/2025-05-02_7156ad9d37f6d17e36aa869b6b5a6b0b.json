  "content": "British comedian and actor Russell Brand appeared in a London court on Friday to face five charges of rape and other sexual offences.\n\nBrand, 49, who became known internationally as the husband of pop star Katy Perry after forging a career in Britain with his risque comedy routines, was charged last month.\n\nHe faces two counts of rape, two of sexual assault and one of indecent assault.\n\nArriving for the first court hearing in the case, Brand made his way slowly through a crush of media and onlookers gathered outside the court.\n\nThe celebrity, dressed casually in a dark coloured open-necked shirt and jeans, spoke only to confirm his details before being granted bail and ordered to appear in court again on May 30.\n\nIn a video response on X after he was charged, Brand denied all the alleged offences and said he was “grateful” for the “opportunity” to defend himself.\n\n“I was a fool before I lived in the light of the Lord. I was a drug addict, a sex addict and an imbecile, but what I never was was a rapist. I’ve never engaged in non-consensual activity,” he said in the video.\n\nThe charges relate to offences alleged to have taken place between 1999 and 2005 involving four women.\n\nProsecutors charged him after a police investigation into allegations following a broadcast of a Channel 4 documentary in September 2023.\n\nLondon’s Metropolitan Police have said the investigation remains open and urged “anyone who has been affected by this case, or anyone who has any information”, to contact officers.\n\nBrand is charged with the rape of a woman in 1999 in the Bournemouth area on England’s south coast, as well as the oral rape and sexual assault of a woman in 2004 in the Westminster area of central London.\n\nHe has also been charged with indecently assaulting a woman in 2001 and sexually assaulting another woman between 2004 and 2005 — both incidents alleged to have taken place in Westminster.\n\nThe court confirmed that he lives part of the time in the United States, but Brand also gave an address in the southern English county of Buckinghamshire.\n\nBorn in 1975 to working-class parents in Essex, east of London, Brand began his stand-up career as a teenager.\n\nHe burst onto the scene as a provocative, often lewd comedian before transforming into a Hollywood star, then an anti-establishment guru and conspiracy theorist who has millions of fans online.\n\nHe has almost seven million subscribers on YouTube, 11.3 million on X and 4.8m on Instagram.\n\nHe presented a show on the BBC’s Radio 2 station between 2006 and 2008 but left after an on-air prank when he left a sexually explicit voicemail for “Fawlty Towers” actor Andrew Sachs about his granddaughter.\n\nHe also presented a “Big Brother” spin-off show for several years and wrote columns for the left-wing Guardian newspaper and penned two autobiographies.\n\nBrand was married to US star Perry for 14 months between 2010 and 2012.\n\nHe is now married to the author and illustrator Laura Gallacher, with whom he has three children.",
