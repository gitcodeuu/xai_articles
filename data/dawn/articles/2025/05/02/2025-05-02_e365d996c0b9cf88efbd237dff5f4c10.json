The programme was arranged at F-9 Park.\n\nThe Dopasi Foundation, in collaboration with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, UNICEF, and the Federal Directorate of Immun­isa­tion (FDI), led a nationwide outreach campaign to promote life-saving power of vaccines and ensure equitable access for all.\n\nStrong public-private partnerships, including Gavi and Unicef, play a vital role in providing vaccines that protect against measles, polio, and other diseases.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 2nd, 2025",
