As a result, market participants are primarily focused on developments regarding regional tensions, interest rates, and the upcoming IMF decision.”\n\nAwais Ashraf, director of research at AKD Securities, also attributed the increase to the lack of any military action from India.\n\n“The likelihood of a full-scale war between Pakistan and India remains low, constrained by the nuclear deterrence factor,” he said.\n\n“[This] has boosted investor confidence, prompting them to take positions in stocks that align well with Pakistan’s improving economic conditions.”\n\nIn recent days, Washington urged India and Pakistan to work with each other to de-escalate tensions and arrive at a “responsible solution.”\n\nThe US State Department has said it was in touch with the nuclear-armed neighbours at multiple levels and Secretary of State Marco Rubio held calls on Wednesday with Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar.",
