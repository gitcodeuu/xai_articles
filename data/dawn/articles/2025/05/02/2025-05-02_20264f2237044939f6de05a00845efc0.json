The incident sparked angry demonstrations from the children’s families.\n\n“The news about the children falling ill, due to the consumption of the midday meal, led to the blocking of the road by the protesting villagers,” it said.\n\nFree lunches are offered to millions of children in government schools throughout India, seen by authorities as a way to encourage children to continue their education.\n\nThe commission said it demanded a “detailed report” from senior state officials and the police, to include “the health status of the children”. It said the report, if confirmed, poses the “serious issue of violation of the human rights of the students,” the statement added.\n\nIn 2013, 23 schoolchildren died after being served a meal laced with pesticides in Saran district of Bihar.\n\nThe disaster prompted the government to improve food safety in schools.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 2nd, 2025",
