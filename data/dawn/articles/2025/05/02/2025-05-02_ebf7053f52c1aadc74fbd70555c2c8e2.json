  "content": "SWAT: The pristine Swat River, once renowned for its crystal-clear waters and breathtaking beauty, is now facing a worsening environmental crisis due to unchecked and illegal gravel mining.\n\nEnvironmentalists, local farmers, and tourists are raising alarms over the destructive consequences of this practice, which is rapidly altering the river’s shape and devastating its surrounding ecosystem.\n\nGravel extraction from the riverbed – carried out using heavy machinery – has intensified in recent months, visibly changing the natural course of the river and triggering a cascade of environmental challenges. Among the most pressing concerns are the degradation of agricultural lands on both sides of the river, increasing erosion, destruction of aquatic habitats, and a noticeable drop in the water table.\n\n“This is not just about gravel; it’s about the future of our ecosystem and livelihood,” said Shamsher Ali, a local environmental activist based in Mingora. “Our fields are drying up, fish populations are disappearing, and the riverbanks are collapsing. The authorities cannot remain silent any longer.”\n\nEnvironmentalist says illegal practice destroying aquatic habitat\n\nLocal farmers, who rely on the Swat River for irrigation, report that their lands have become less fertile and more prone to flooding and erosion. The disappearance of native fish species has also affected the livelihoods of small-scale fishermen and diminished the region’s appeal to eco-tourists.\n\nDespite the gravity of the issue, activists claim that gravel mining continues unabated, often carried out under the cover of darkness or with the tacit support of local contractors. Many fear that without immediate government intervention, the damage could become irreversible.\n\nTourists, who flock to Swat for its natural beauty, have also joined voices with environmentalists. “I have been visiting Swat for the past 10 years. This time, I saw bulldozers in the river and clouds of dust. It’s heartbreaking,” said Fatima Khan, a tourist from Islamabad.\n\nLocals also reported that the mismanaged excavations have created deep pits within the river, posing significant dangers to swimmers. “My brother was swimming with his friends and suddenly disappeared. The rescue teams and local volunteers searched for him for days and finally found his body in a deep pit,” Abdullah Khan told Dawn. He called on the government to take legal action against those responsible for the deaths of innocent people while swimming in the river.\n\nEnvironmental groups are demanding a complete and immediate ban on illegal gravel mining and have warned that they will stage protests if the practice is not halted.\n\nThe district administration has yet to issue an official response. However, insiders suggest that discussions are underway between provincial environmental agencies and local officials to address the crisis.\n\nWhen contacted, additional deputy commissioner Hamid Buneri told Dawn that the mines and minerals department had granted the contractors proper leases, and that the district administration would soon hold discussions with the relevant department on the issue.\n\nFor now, the Swat River continues to suffer — and with it, the communities that depend on it.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 2nd, 2025",
