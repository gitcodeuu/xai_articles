He stated that last year chief minister ordered appointment of chairmen of DDACs in 30 of the districts across the province.\n\nHe said that the said 30 chairmen were all MPAs affiliated with the ruling party in the province. He said that in the remaining six districts, the chairmen were not appointed as the elected MPAs in those districts were mostly from opposition parties.\n\nHe argued that the present petitioners filed a petition in the high court against the non-appointment of chairmen of DDACs in the said six districts by the provincial government.\n\nThe counsel stated that the petitioners sought directives of the court for the government to appoint chairmen of DDACs in the districts of Dera Ismail Khan, North Waziristan, Upper Dir, Upper Chitral, Kurram and Kohistan Lower.\n\nHe pointed out that the chief minister then ordered appointment of MNAs as chairmen of DDACs in the said districts, which was also challenged by the petitioners in the high court.\n\nHe argued that in order to circumvent and defeat the pray made in that petition, the provincial government passed the impugned Establishment of DDAC (Amendment) Act through its brute majority in the assembly.\n\nHe stated that through the said amendment changes were made in Section 3 of DDAC Act and MNAs of the relevant districts were also included in the committees.\n\nHe contended that the amendment was in violation of different provisions of the Constitution including articles 66, 126, 141, 142 and 143 along with Fourth Schedule of the Constitution.\n\nMr Sultan argued that the provincial legislature had gone beyond its powers, functions and jurisdiction under the Constitution by including MNAs in the law. He added that the provincial legislature was not empowered to make a law for the MNAs, who fell under the federal domain.\n\nHe contended that being elected public representatives, the petitioners had a genuine cause of action to approach the court to correct the illegalities and discrimination being committed by the respondents.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 2nd, 2025",
