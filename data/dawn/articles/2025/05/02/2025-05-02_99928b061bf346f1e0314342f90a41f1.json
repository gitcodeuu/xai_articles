And as I said, this is going to be a multi-step process. First, we need to de-escalate, and then … we will start focusing on a larger trade deal,” Bessent said in an interview with Fox Business Network this week.\n\nTrump said on Wednesday he believed there was a “very good chance” his administration could do a deal with China, hours after Chinese President Xi Jinping called on officials to take action to adjust to changes in the international environment without explicitly mentioning the United States.",
