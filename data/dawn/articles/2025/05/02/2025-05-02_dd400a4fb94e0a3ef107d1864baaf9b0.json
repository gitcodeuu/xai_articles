He acknowledged the ILO’s role in supporting vulnerable workers and called for an institutional framework for effective labour dispute resolution.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, ILO Country Director Geir Tonstol said that “tripartite dialogue is not just beneficial, it is essential”.\n\nHe added, “In today’s evolving world of work, industrial harmony depends on inclusive, consensus-driven solutions that reflect the lived realities of our labour force. The ILO is proud to support Pakistan’s journey towards fairer, safer and more equitable workplaces.”\n\nThe national conference called on the government, employers and workers’ organisations to enhance institutional capacity, promote labour law compliance, invest in dispute prevention and resolution mechanisms and promote a culture of open dialogue and mutual respect at all levels.\n\nThe event proposed establishing a national tripartite forum to address emerging workplace challenges proactively. Participants underscored resolving labour disputes through social dialogue, conciliation and mutual understanding, reaffirming that labour rights must ensure decent working conditions and workplace safety.\n\nThe conference was attended by a large number of workers, legal experts and dignitaries, including retired Justice Mian Shakirullah Jan, former Supreme Court judge Syed Atique Shah, the chief justice of the Peshawar High Court, and Supreme Court Bar Association General Secretary Salman Mansoor Siddiqui.\n\nRight to dignity\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi emphasised on Thursday that Labour Day serves as a solemn occasion to pay tribute to the resilience, dedication and sacrifices of the working men and women, whose contributions are foundational to national development and economic growth.\n\nIn his Labour Day message, Justice Afridi highlighted the judiciary’s responsibility as the guardian of constitutional rights, reinforcing the importance of social justice, equity and labour rights protection.\n\n“The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan embodies the right to dignity, fair remuneration and just and humane conditions of work as fundamental principles of policy,” he said.\n\n“These rights are not merely aspirational — but are enforceable legal and moral obligations for the State. The judiciary, as guardian of the Constitution and arbiter of justice, bears a profound responsibility to ensure that these guarantees are realised in both letter and spirit,” he added.\n\nThe CJP stressed that historically, Pakistani courts have played a pivotal role in safeguarding labour rights, addressing exploitative practices and interpreting protective labour legislation. The judiciary “has strived to act as a bulwark against discrimination, coercion and inequality at the workplace”, he said\n\nHe urged judicial forums handling labour matters to remain vigilant about socio-economic realities faced by workers, emphasising the judiciary’s commitment to accessible, expeditious and fair adjudication of disputes.\n\nHe called for strengthened institutional mechanisms to promote decent work, eliminate forced and child labour, ensure workplace safety and uphold labour dignity, fulfilling the constitutional promise of a just society.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 2nd, 2025",
