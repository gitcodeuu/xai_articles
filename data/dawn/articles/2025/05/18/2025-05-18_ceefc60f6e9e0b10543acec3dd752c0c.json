  "content": "NAROWAL: Federal Defence Minister Khwaja Muhammad Asif says India patronises terrorist organisations and banned outfits like the BNA (Baloch National Army (BNA) and TTP (Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan) and our war will be against the terrorists.\n\n“India has been involved in terrorism on our western borders for the past 40 years,” he said while speaking to the media here. He said that India had been fighting a proxy war on the western borders of Pakistan for the past several years and added that it was defeated by the Pakistan army on the eastern front while it would now face a bad defeat on the front in the west of Pakistan.\n\n“Our forces have defeated India on the ground, in the air and on water,” he said and added that the name of Pakistan army chief Gen Asif Munir would be written in history.\n\nKhwaja Asif said if India attacked Pakistan again, it would get a stronger response.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",
