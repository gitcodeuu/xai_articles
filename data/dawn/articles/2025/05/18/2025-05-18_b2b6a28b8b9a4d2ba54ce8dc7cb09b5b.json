It called for coordination of authorities with the National Highway Authority, Frontier Works Organisation and communication and works department for the timely restoration of roads in case of any obstruction, closure and damage.\n\nIn an earlier advisory, the PDMA had asked district administrations across the province to take all necessary measures to prevent any loss of life and damage to crops and livestock during the heat wave.\n\nIt also asked them to launch awareness campaigns about the developing heat wave-like conditions, ensure that people, especially senior citizens and children, are aware of the situation and avoid direct exposure to sunlight between 1000 and 1700 hours and make judicious use of water for drinking and cooling off.\n\nThe PMDA also encouraged residents with underlying health conditions to remain vigilant, ensure they have necessary medical supplies readily available, promote the use of appropriate protective measures, such as lightweight, loosely-fit and light-coloured clothing, along with sun protection and hats, and educate public about the signs and symptoms of heat-related issues like dehydration, heat exhaustion and heatstroke, and necessary action.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",
