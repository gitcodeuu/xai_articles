Others left voluntarily,” member of the Sungar village council Rashid Khan told reporters on Saturday.\n\nA joint team comprising officials from the tehsil administration and police and led by assistant commissioner Nadar Khan and Balakot deputy superintendent of police Nisar Saddaqat, carried out the operation using heavy machinery to level the structures.\n\n“The team also gave a final opportunity to several other occupants to vacate their homes voluntarily before proceeding with the demolitions,” Mr Khan said.\n\nHe added that the 300MW Balakot hydropower project was progressing well, with over 800 kanals of land already acquired in Sungar by the district administration for the dam and related infrastructure.\n\n“The government plans to build a residential colony for Chinese engineers and workers involved in the project,” he said.\n\nMr Khan, who also serves on a joint committee formed by the local community and the Pakhtunkhwa Energy Development Organisation (Pedo) to resolve dam-related matters, said compensation for land acquired in Kaghan Valley and the rest of Balakot had already been disbursed by the district administration.\n\nHowever, a group of Sungar residents claimed that while they had received payment for their land, compensation for their houses under the Kitchen Package had yet to be made.\n\n“The administration has paid us for the land, but we have still been waiting for payments for our houses and kitchen package,” one of the affected residents told reporters.\n\nThe Balakot hydropower project is the largest hydroelectric initiative being executed by Pedo anywhere in the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",
