People ran back and were screaming!” Corso, who does marketing for the entertainment company VeeFriends, said.\n\n“The one thing that stood out to me was the panic on the ship, and there was a guy at the back waving for people to move away from the walkway we were on,” he said.\n\nThe Mexican Navy said in its statement that no one had fallen into the water, and that no rescue operation had been launched.\n\nThe ship had been departing New York at the time, and flags also fluttered in the rigging, while an enormous Mexican flag waved off its stern.\n\nSeconds after the ship left the dock, “suddenly we saw all the lights, how they collided, hit the bridge, and they (the sailors) all fell down,” Arturo Acatitla, a 37-year-old New York resident, told AFP.\n\n“While inspections will remain ongoing, there are no signs of structural damage to the Brooklyn Bridge,” the New York transport department posted on X.\n\nThe bridge, which leads from Brooklyn into Manhattan, was closed for some 40 minutes before reopening.\n\nVictims were taken to the hospital, Mexican ambassador Esteban Moctezuma Barragan told a news conference, and sirens could be heard near the scene.\n\nNew York Police Department’s Aramboles said the Cuauhtemoc, a barque built in 1982, which had a mast height of 48.2 metres (158 feet), was sailing to Iceland when it crashed.\n\n“With mariachi, folk ballet and a community full of emotion, we celebrated its arrival at Pier 17 in Manhattan,” the embassy post said.\n\nThe Cuauhtemoc was damaged in the “mishap,” the Mexican Navy confirmed in a statement on X.\n\n“The Ministry of the Navy reaffirms its commitment to the safety of its personnel, transparency in its operations and excellence in the training of future officers of the Mexican Navy,” it said.\n\nThe ship was later moved to near the Manhattan Bridge, an AFP journalist saw.\n\nThe New York Police Department advised residents on X to avoid the area due to “heavy traffic” and “a large presence of emergency vehicles.”\n\nThe incident is the second deadly ship crash into a bridge in the United States in little over a year, after a vessel smashed into a bridge in Baltimore in March 2024, causing it to collapse and killing six road workers.",
