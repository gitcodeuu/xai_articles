Firefighting, search & rescue operations were carried out simultaneously,” it said.\n\nThe statement also listed the names of 17 individuals who lost their lives.\n\n“The suspected cause of the fire is under investigation,” it said.\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed his “deep grief” over the loss of life and announced compensation of 200,000 rupees (around $2,300) to the next of kin of each victim.\n\n“Deeply anguished by the loss of lives due to a fire tragedy in Hyderabad, Telangana,” Modi said in a statement released by his office.\n\n“Condolences to those who have lost their loved ones. May the injured recover soon.”\n\nFires are common in India due to poor building practices, overcrowding and a lack of adherence to safety regulations.\n\nLast month, a fierce fire broke out in a hotel in Kolkata, killing at least 15 people. Some people clambered out of windows and onto the rooftop to escape.\n\nAnd last year, least 24 people died after a fire broke out at a packed amusement park arcade in the western state of Gujarat.",
