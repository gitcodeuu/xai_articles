  "content": "MARDAN: A multi-party conference organised by Awami National Party here on Friday rejected the proposed Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Minerals Act, 2025, and declared it as a clear violation of the Constitution of Pakistan.\n\nLeaders and representatives of different political parties participated in the MPC, and asked the federal and provincial governments to withdraw the proposed law as it was an ‘attack’ on the provincial autonomy and rights of KP people.\n\nProminent among those who participated were former MPA Ahmad Khan Bahadar, city mayor Himayatullah Mayar, ANP district president Imran Mandoori and general secretary Fazal Rehman Binyameen, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz district president Inayat Ali Shah Bacha Advocate, district emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Ghulam Rasool, Mufti Hamaadullah and Qari Abdul Waqeel of Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party district president Pervaz Khan, general secretary of district bar association Zulfiqar Khan Advocate and others.\n\nThe MPC passed a declaration opposing the proposed legislation. The declaration stated that the draft of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mines and Minerals Act, 2025 was against the interests of the people of the province. The proposed legislation was declared a black law, and warned that if passed, the law would become a cause of confrontation between the centre and the province.\n\nThe meeting also asserted that the proposed legislation would not only be the violation of the 18th Amendment but would also be considered as a robbery on the rights of KP province.\n\nThe declaration noted that the 18th Amendment guaranteed the provinces’ rights over their natural resources. It made it clear that no intervention and interference by the centre in the affairs of provinces would be tolerated.\n\nThe declaration demanded that the draft law should be withdrawn promptly. It also asked the quarters concerned to not pass or make any such legislation that was in violation of the Constitution of Pakistan.\n\nThe participants threatened that an aggressive and vigorous movement would be launched if efforts were made for the proposed law’s passage from the provincial assembly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",
