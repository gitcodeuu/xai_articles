India also attacked Pakistani airbases and military targets, prompting Pakistan to target its military installations using missiles and airstrikes.\n\nHowever, on the same day, both countries agreed to cease hostilities at the US request, which along with other countries played a major role in de-escalation. According to Reuters, a rapid diplomatic effort to broker the ceasefire succeeded on May 10, but diplomats and analysts say “it remains fragile”.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, who made the ceasefire announ­ce­ment, had said that talks sho­uld take place at a third-country venue but no dates or location for the talks have been announced. India, however, is reluctant to agree to this proposal, saying any talks would be “strictly bilateral”.\n\nAsked about India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, squeezing Pakistan’s water supply, Mr Lammy said: “We would urge all sides to meet their treaty obligations.”\n\nIndia had “put in abeyance” its participation in the 1960 pact, which governs use of the Indus river system, a move Pakistan considers ‘an act of war’ if its access to water is disrupted.\n\nThe British foreign minister said London would also continue to work with Pakistan on countering “terrorism”, saying it is “a terrible blight on this country and its people, and of course on the region.”\n\nAfghan refugees\n\nSeparately, David Lam­my on Saturday lauded Pakistan for facilitating the relocation of Afghan refugees to the United Kingdom, in a meeting with Interior Minister Mohsin Raza Naqvi.\n\nDuring the meeting at the ministry, both sides discussed Pakistan-United Kingdom relations and developmental partnerships.\n\nAppreciating the UK’s support under the ‘Upsca­­le programme’, the interior minister said the initi­ative was playing a key role in curbing organised crime.\n\nHe added that both cou­ntries were working joint­­ly in the areas of illegal im­­migration, online child harassment, mutual legal assistance and extradit­ion, criminal record exch­ange, sex offender management, illicit financing, and counter-­narcotics.\n\nHe highlighted that the cooperation under the programme was yielding positive results in preventing serious and organised crimes, saying that with the support of the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency, Pakistan’s Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) had seized 4.3 tonnes of opium, valued at £22 million.\n\nIftikhar A.
