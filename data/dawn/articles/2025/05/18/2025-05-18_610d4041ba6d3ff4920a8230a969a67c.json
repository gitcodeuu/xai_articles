He pointed out that education and information about traffic laws were key elements in prevention of accidents, but 98 per cent of people only knew how to operate vehicles and lacked basic knowledge of rights of others on the road, traffic rules and safe and responsible driving practices.\n\nMr Suhag also highlighted behavioural issues and said that drivers often lack patience and refuse to give way to others, even in emergencies.\n\nHe also criticised the common refusal to wear helmets and gave the example of a case where a man told him that his son avoided wearing helmet because it “ruins his hairstyle”. Such attitudes reflected a dangerous ignorance that must be addressed through consistent education and law enforcement, he concluded.\n\nDr Sabir Memon of the Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Institute of Trauma asked citizens to act responsibly and highlighted the global impact of traffic accidents.\n\n“Around 1.3 million people die each year in road accidents worldwide, with most incidents occurring in middle-income countries,” he said.\n\nAbout Karachi, Dr Memon said that a sharp rise in accident cases had been seen lately. “Previously, we received about 100 cases daily, but now that number has grown to nearly 150 per day,” he said, adding that two-thirds of the victims were motorcyclists, many of whom were young boys and teenagers.\n\nHe also spoke about the serious consequences of such accidents and pointed out that many accident victims were sole breadwinners of their families who suffered life-altering injuries and then were unable to return to work.\n\nThose injuries didn’t just affect individuals; they impacted entire families and caused social and economic loss and burden of healthcare sector, he said.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, DIG-Traffic Pir Mohammad Shah said that while law enforcement was a key issue, public awareness of traffic laws was equally important. Providing statistics, he said that 55pc of road accident victims were motorcyclists, 32pc pedestrians and the rest involved cars and other vehicles.\n\nHe then outlined multiple causes behind road accidents, which included over-speeding, lack of lane discipline and the absence of a proper system to monitor the load carried by heavy vehicles.\n\nHe said overloaded trucks without under-run bars, side under-run rails or guards often led to fatal accidents, especially when motorcyclists were run over during collisions.\n\nThe officer also pointed out that motorcyclists overtaking from the left side of heavy vehicles was a major contributor to such accidents.\n\nHe also raised concerns about the mental and physical fitness of heavy vehicle drivers, which he said was currently under investigation.\n\nDIG Shah noted that the shortage of traffic signals was another major issue. That was primarily due to insufficient funding for the Traffic Engineering Bureau. He added that efforts were underway to make the department more autonomous in the near future.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr Qaisar Sajjad said that up to 207 deaths had been reported in the city so far this year, most of which involved heavy vehicles.\n\nHe said lack of law enforcement, poor infrastructure such as broken roads and weak coordination between departments were significant problems. There were also widespread encroachments on roads and footpaths which left no space for pedestrians and created serious hazards, he added.\n\nHe emphasised that these issues must be urgently addressed to reduce the rising number of traffic-related fatalities.\n\nFaisal Edhi of the Edhi Foundation also spoke.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 18th, 2025",
