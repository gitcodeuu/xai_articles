However, they claimed significant capacity payments amounting to Rs26.95bn, Rs30.88bn and Rs11.26bn, respectively.\n\nMr Shaikh further noted that the total capacity payment claimed by Discos for the third quarter of FY25 amounted to Rs362.395bn, compared to a reference figure of Rs459.286bn.\n\nElectricity sales during this period were 19,968GWh, compared to the reference figure of 21,846GWh. Typically, such a decline in sales would lead to an increase in per-unit capacity charges due to the fixed nature of these payments.\n\n“In total, around Rs69.09bn has been claimed in capacity charges despite minimal generation. This reflects a major inefficiency in the system and underscores the urgent need to address transmission bottlenecks and improve generation dispatch practices to ensure optimal use of available low-cost generation resources,” Mr Shaikh stated.\n\nThe additional note also pointed out that the termination of certain power purchase agreements (PPAs) and other adjustments related to independent power producers (IPPs) during the quarter contributed to a decrease in projected capacity payments. While this resulted in a negative adjustment for the third quarter, Mr Shaikh emphasised that improved governance and more efficient system operations could have further enhanced electricity sales — potentially leading to a greater reduction in adjustment amounts.\n\nThe note also called attention to the performance of public sector Gencos — specifically Genco-II (Guddu Old), Genco-III (TPS Muzaffargarh) and Genco-I (Jamshoro Power Company Limited) — which collectively claimed capacity payments totaling Rs1.23bn (Rs469 million, Rs350m and Rs418m, respectively) despite generating no electricity during the quarter.\n\nThese plants, Mr Shaikh noted, suffer from high generation costs and low operational efficiency, with little likelihood of being dispatched by the system operator in the future, given the current surplus of more cost-effective capacity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 11th, 2025",
