He regretted that continued Indian belligerence had left Pakistan with no option but to respond decisively in defence of its sovereignty and to protect its citizens.\n\nPresident Zardari emphasised that the entire Pakistani nation stands united and resolutely supports its armed forces in the face of Indian aggression. He reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar were also present during the meeting.\n\nMeanwhile, in a series of telephonic conversations, PM Shehbaz briefed PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar, JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman, MQM convener Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, Jamaat-i-Islami emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman, Balochistan Awami Party leader Khalid Hussain Magsi and PML-Q’s Chaudhry Salik Hussain on the security situation and Pakistan’s measured yet firm response to Indian aggression, a PM Office news release said.\n\n“Alhamdulillah, the armed forces of Pakistan gave a powerful and well-coordinated response to India’s unprovoked aggression,” the prime minister said. Despite repeated provocations, he stated, Pakistan had exercised restraint. He recalled how, after the Pahalgam incident, Pakistan had demanded an impartial investigation, an offer India rejected. However, Saturday morning’s assaults left Pakistan with no choice but to respond decisively.\n\nPM Shehbaz confirmed that Pakistan’s retaliatory action under “Operation Bunyan al-Marsous” had specifically targeted Indian military installations used in the attacks. “We have delivered a resounding reply and avenged the blood of the innocent. We are proud of our armed forces.”\n\nThe prime minister extended congratulations to the nation and praised the armed forces for their valour and professionalism.\n\nThe political leaders echoed their support, applauding the military’s composure and tactical expertise. They also pledged full solidarity with the government and armed forces.\n\nPM Shehbaz expressed gratitude for their clear and unwavering support, emphasising national unity in the face of external threats.\n\nNation stands united\n\nBilawal Bhutto-Zardari said Pakistan’s response was necessary, proportionate and in clear exercise of the country’s right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter. “We do not seek war, but neither will we tolerate aggression. The nation stands united,” he said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nFrom Karachi to Khyber, from Gwadar to Gilgit, every Pakistani stands by the armed forces, he added. “We salute the professionalism of our defenders including our valiant Air Force and the unity of our people. No force can break a nation whose spirit is forged in sacrifice and solidarity,” he added.\n\nMaulana Fazl praised the nation for standing united in the face of Indian aggression. “In the difficult hour, with the help and support of Allah Almighty and the steadfastness of the nation, Pakistan has triumphed against Indian aggression,” the JUI-F chief wrote on X.\n\n“I extend my congratulations to the entire nation, political leaders, and the armed forces. Indian and Israeli conspiracy to plunge the region into fire and blood has failed, and that the unity between the citizens and the political leadership, behind a robust defence, compelled the enemy to retreat,” he added.\n\n“May Allah Almighty protect us from all kinds of trials in the future … keep our beloved homeland safe and bless the nation with the true blessings of an Islamic welfare state,” he wrote, thanking “brotherly countries” like Saudi Arabia for their role in mediating the conflict.\n\nPTI’s central information secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that during the phone call with the prime minister, Barrister Gohar reaffirmed his party’s unwavering commitment to safeguarding the country’s sovereignty and national dignity.\n\nThe PTI praised the armed forces — particularly the Pakistan Air Force — alongside a resolute nation, for delivering a befitting and decisive response that brought rogue India to its knees.\n\nThe party also claimed that its social media activists effectively countered India’s online narrative, defeating its warmongering digital campaign during the three-day standoff as part of the ongoing fifth-generation warfare.\n\nWith input from APP\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 11th, 2025",
