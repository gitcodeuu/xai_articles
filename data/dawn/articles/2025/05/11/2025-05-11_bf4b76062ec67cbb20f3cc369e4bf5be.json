  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Defence Minister Khawaja Asif on Saturday said India was gripped by the hubris of power, but its arrogance has collapsed in the face of Pakistan’s composed and strategic response.\n\nSpeaking to a private news channel, he said India expected a weak response, but its strategy crumbled before Pakistan’s calm and calculated response.\n\nThe myth of Indians’ arrogance has vanished into thin air, he added.\n\nHe stated that India aimed to set a lower bar in bilateral relations, hoping to push Pakistan into a weak, vessel-like state. But their strategic ambitions have turned to dust, he asserted.\n\nHe emphasised that Pakistan maintained restraint throughout the episode, kept its threshold low, and prioritised peace without compromising its presence or security.\n\nIndia’s military and diplomatic assessments have been proven wrong. Their narrative has found no acceptance globally due to their failure to provide evidence or allow impartial investigation, he said.\n\nHe praised the diplomatic support shown by key allies and friendly nations including China, Turkiye, Azerbaijan and Gulf partners.\n\nHe further said that India failed to secure backing from a single country.\n\nThe minister reaffirmed that Pakistan remains open to dialogue on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir, the Indus Waters Treaty, and terrorism.\n\n“We hope India, and particularly its leadership, will one day prioritise the region’s future over party interests. Peaceful coexistence based on equality is key to South Asia’s progress,” he concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 11th, 2025",
