God Bless the leadership of India and Pakistan on a job well done!!!” the US president added.\n\nHe highlighted: “Millions of good and innocent people could have died! Your legacy is greatly enhanced by your brave actions. I am proud that the USA was able to help you arrive at this historic and heroic decision.”\n\nThe US president further said he would “substantially” increase trade with both Pakistan and India, terming them “great nations”.",
