Two terrorists were killed on the spot.”\n\nThe spokesperson added that Lakki Marwat District Police Officer Jawad led a search operation to trace the escaped terrorists.\n\n“Local peace committees cooperated fully with the police,” Khan added.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.\n\nPakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.\n\nHowever, a significant improvement was seen in Pakistan’s internal security landscape in April 2025, “as both militant attacks and resultant casualties dropped sharply compared to March”, according to data released by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.",
