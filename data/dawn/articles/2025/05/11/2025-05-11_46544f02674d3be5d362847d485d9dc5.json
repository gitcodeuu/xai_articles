He tha­n­ked Allah Almighty for granting Pa­­kistan dignity and honour. “Pak­is­tan is a peace-loving nation and prioritises peace but it also knows how to defend itself,” he added.\n\nAlso, Punjab Chief Minis­ter Maryam Nawaz in a statement hailed Pakistan’s courageous response to India’s aggression and said: “I salute those protectors of our land, who responded not only with bullets but also with honour, wisdom and courage. We are not weak, rather we were silent just for the sake of peace in the region.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 11th, 2025",
