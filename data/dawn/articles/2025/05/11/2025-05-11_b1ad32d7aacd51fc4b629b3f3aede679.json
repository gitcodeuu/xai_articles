  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s exports to European countries grew 8.18 per cent in the first nine months of the current fiscal year from a year ago, mainly due to higher shipments to western and southern states.\n\nIn absolute terms, Pakistan’s exports to the European Union (EU) reached $6.782 billion in July-March FY25 from $6.269bn last year, according to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nThe export resurgence was due to a slight increase in demand for Pakistani goods in western, eastern and northern Europe. The revival of export proceeds to these countries shows a rising trend for Pakistani textile and clothing products.\n\nIn FY24, Pakistan’s exports to the EU dipped 3.12pc to $8.240bn despite its GSP+ status, which allows duty-free entry into most European markets.\n\nWestern Europe, which includes countries such as Germany, the Netherlands, France, Italy, and Belgium, accounts for the largest portion of Pakistan’s exports to the EU. The exports to this region increased by 9.42pc to $3.403bn in 9MFY25, up from $3.110bn in 9MFY24.\n\nThere is also a slight increase in exports to eastern and northern Europe. The exports to the north of Eur­ope saw a rise of 17.49pc to $559.52m in 9MFY25, up from $476.22m in the corresponding months last year.\n\nExports to southern Europe saw a paltry growth of 2.88pc to $2.281bn in 9MFY25 from $2.217bn in the corresponding period last year.\n\nIn this region, exports to Spain record a paltry growth of 1.85pc to $1.10 billion in 9MFY25 from $1.08bn in the preceding year.\n\nExports to Italy increased 1.95pc to $841.69m in 9MFY25 compared to $825.53m in the same period last year. Exports to Greece increased 9.7pc to $107.21m during the year under review against $98.02m over the previous year.\n\nHowever, exports to eastern Europe grew 15.57pc to $539.21m from $466.53m in the corresponding period last year.\n\nBefore Brexit, Pakistan’s major export destination was the United Kingdom. In the post-Brexit period, Pakistan’s exports to the UK slightly went up to $1.624bn in 9MFY25 from $1.531bn over the corresponding period of last year, an increase of 6.07pc.\n\nPakistan’s exports to western Europe increased by 9.42pc to $3.403bn in 9MFY24 from $3.110bn last year.\n\nExports to Germany surged 13.54pc to $1.274bn in 9MFY24 from $1.122bn. Similarly, exports to the Netherlands, the second biggest market for Pakistani goods, increased 9.35pc to $1.122bn in 9MFY25 from $1.026bn over the corresponding period of last year.\n\nExports to France rose 10.88pc to $420.56m in 9MFY24 from $379.29m, followed by a 4.72pc rise to Belgium’s $424.61m against $405.44m. There is a rising trend in exports to France in the past few weeks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 11th, 2025",
