  "content": "KARACHI: Although Pakistan and India have reached a ceasefire agreement on Saturday evening, the threat of an all-out war between the two neighbours has compelled the police, district administration and rescue services to take precautionary measures in anticipation of any eventuality.\n\nOfficials said that control rooms had been set up, emergency high-alert teams deployed at all sensitive installations and a crackdown launched against suspects previously involved in acts of terrorism.\n\nPolice patrolling and checking had been enhanced on roads/routes leading to sensitive installations in the metropolis and other parts of the Sindh province.\n\nMeanwhile, many residents remained concerned about the security situation as long queues of people were seen at a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant near Kalapul on Saturday morning where men, women and even children waited with bottles, cans and other containers to collect potable water.\n\nEmergency control rooms activated, security at sensitive sites beefed up as precautionary measures\n\nA senior official, who wished not to be named, told Dawn that Inspector General of Police Ghulam Nabi Memon on Saturday issued general instructions to all policemen in view of the current national security situation.\n\nHe said that in response to last night’s attacks carried out under in various parts of the country, the Pakistan army and air force executed a robust and effective retaliatory operation. Keeping in view the increasing threats (before the ceasefire announced) the police had been directed to set up “war-time emergency control rooms” at every district, range/division and zonal level.\n\nAccording to the order issued by the IGP: “All officers and officials of Sindh police are hereby directed to remain on high alert at all times in view of the prevailing security situation.”\n\nTalking to Dawn, IGP Memon said: “Police are responsible mainly for maintenance of law and order, crime control and its detection, traffic management and matters related to internal security.”\n\nHe added: “We have briefed all our command officers and their subordinate staff about the nature of the threat and their responsibilities.”\n\n“We are actively working against absconding accused who were involved in any act of terrorism in the province and so far, no has been arrested,” the IGP said, adding: “Besides, we have close liaison with the rescue and disaster management agencies to help them in case of any emergency.”\n\nDIG-South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn that security had been enhanced at Karachi Port Trust, PAF Masroor Base, oil installations, ICI Bridge, Kannup and other sensitive installations.\n\nRescue-1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Shaikh told Dawn that they had implemented the contingency plan in coordination with district administration and that “we are ready to respond to any kind of emergency situation.”\n\nDr Abid added that “drills have started in close coordination with district administration while control rooms are fully functional.”\n\nHigh alert at health facilities\n\nResponding to concerns about the government’s preparedness for an emergency situation in view of the recent Indian strikes, Sindh Health Secretary Rehan Baloch said the department had taken all necessary steps in this regard.\n\n“All hospitals both in the public and private sector and health units been put on high alert and the staff have been directed to perform round-the-clock duties,” he said, adding that 100 beds had been dedicated at the CHK alone in case of any eventuality.\n\n“Similar steps have been taken at other hospitals in the province. The Trauma Centre and CHK have been directed to coordinate for better emergency response and management,” he added.\n\nMr Baloch also stated that the health department had organised an online meeting with all district health officers and relevant officials to ensure everyone was on board. “Medicines are in ample supply, and there is no need to worry,” he said in response to a question.\n\nSources at the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) shared that the administration had established rapid response teams comprising general surgeons, vascular surgeons, neurosurgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, paramedical staff and administrative personnel to address any emergency.\n\n“We have dedicated 30 per cent beds. In addition, the hospital has made arrangements for a power supply back-up. Extra fuel has also been arranged to keep the hospital operational without interruption for 48 hours in case of any emergency,” explained JPMC’s Deputy Executive Director Dr Yahya Tunio, adding that staff’s holidays had been cancelled.\n\nDr Tunio said that a communication strategy has also been implemented for better coordination with security agencies.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sindh Blood Transfusion Authority has issued a notification to all district health officers, declaring an emergency and high alert at all blood banks in both the public and private sectors across the province.\n\n“You are requested to be more vigilant in your district not only to ensure that all the SOPs are being followed but make sure for the availability of sufficient blood and its essential products within the blood banks (public and private) in your respective districts,” the notification says.\n\nLong queues at RO plants\n\nEarlier in the day amid threats of an all-out war, a Reverse Osmosis (RO) plant near Kalapul saw long queues of men, women and children who waited with bottles, cans and any container that they could grab hold of at home to fill up with potable water.\n\n“I could hear small explosions since 4 or 5am. And I knew that a fully fledged war was close. Storing up on rations comes later. I had to first store up on water. I reached here around 6am,” said Karima, who was waiting in line for her turn with her daughter-in-law, at around 9am.\n\nAsked why the men in her family could not come for water, she nodded and pointed to a young man with a little boy standing in line with water cans in hand on the gent’s side of the RO plant. “That’s my son and grandson there,” she said.\n\nThe family said that they lived in nearby Hazara Colony, which had been without line water for almost a month now.\n\nA few people there from Chanesar Goth were complaining that they had not received any line water for over six months now.\n\nSome boys with water cans there said that they were from Qayyumabad, which was also not getting any water through the lines. “We come here to fill our cans with water every other day, but today was different,” Jamal, a teenager from Qayyumabad, told Dawn.\n\n“Our entire household was up all night watching the news. We have an entire list of things to do for today, but water is at the top of our list,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 11th, 2025",
