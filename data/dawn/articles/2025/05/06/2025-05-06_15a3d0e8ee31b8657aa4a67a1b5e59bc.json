Quoting the Holy Quran, he said that justice should be done even with the enemies. He also said that the Peca Act be withdrawn and there should not be restrictions on freedom of expression.\n\nThe TTAP chief suggested that the government should reduce its expenditure so that relief be provided to the masses.\n\nHe also said that the letter written by the judges of Islamabad High Court should be taken seriously and transfer/postings be withdrawn. He urged the decision-makers to address the issue of missing persons.\n\nAccording to the 16-point agenda, the SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council) was an attack on provincial autonomy and the policy of slowing of internet should be abolished.\n\nPTI parliamentary party meeting\n\nMeanwhile, the PTI’s parliamentary party demanded that a multi-party conference be held and party founder Imran Khan be invited to it.\n\nThe demand was made during a meeting chaired by Zartaj Gul Wazir and attended by Omar Ayub Khan, Barrister Gohar, Shibli Faraz, Malik Amir Dogar, Hamid Raza and others.\n\nThe participants of the huddle were of the view that differences were increasing between the masses and the judiciary.\n\nThey also condemned the false flag operation in India and claimed that Pakistan has nothing to do with it.
