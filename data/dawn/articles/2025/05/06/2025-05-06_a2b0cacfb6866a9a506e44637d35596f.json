Read said ocean conditions off the San Diego County coast were rough at the time, with two metres seas reported.\n\nPersonnel from HSI, the US Border Patrol, the local fire department and law enforcement also responded to the scene, officials said.\n\nSo far this fiscal year, since October 2024, the Coast Guard has tracked 277 vessels clandestinely entering US waters from Mexico in the San Diego area, some of the boats being interdicted and others getting away, Read said. Those incidents resulted in 983 people being apprehended.\n\nThat compares with 1,354 maritime border-crossing incidents in the same region during the previous 12 months, with 561 individuals taken into custody during that period.\n\nOf the four hospitalised survivors from Thursday’s panga capsizing, one was listed in critical condition when rescued, according to a statement from the city of Encinitas.\n\nOne survivor reported that 18 people had been aboard the vessel, and 18 life vests were located on shore, the statement said. But Read said the Coast Guard’s best information was that the boat was carrying just 16 individuals when it capsized.",
