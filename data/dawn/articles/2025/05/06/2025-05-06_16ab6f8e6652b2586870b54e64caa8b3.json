  "content": "SANAA: Houthis said the United States and Israel struck the port of Hodeida on Monday, hours after a reported US air raid on Sanaa and a day after the Iran-backed fighters targeted Israel’s main airport.\n\nThe Houthi-run Al-Masirah television said that “US-Israeli aggression targets with six strikes the port of Hodeida” on Yemen’s western coast, also reporting “US-Israeli aggression on the Bajil district” in the same province. An Israeli official confirmed that Israeli warplanes struck Yemen.\n\nEarlier the Houthis’ Saba news agency said US strikes hit the capital Sanaa and the airport road, wounding 16 people according to the Houthi-run health ministry. Al-Masirah reported another three strikes in Sanaa and seven in the northern governorate of Al-Jawf.\n\nThe reports on Houthi media come after Israel said a missile fired from Yemen on Sunday struck inside the perimeter of Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv for the first time.\n\nThe Houthis claimed responsibility, saying they fired a “hypersonic ballistic missile” at Ben Gurion, Israel’s main international gateway. The rebels said they “will work to impose a comprehensive air blockade on the Israeli enemy by repeatedly targeting airports, most notably… Ben Gurion Airport”.\n\nThe missile gouged a wide crater in the ground near an airport parking lot, injuring six people and forcing airlines to suspend flights.\n\nThe Houthis, who control swathes of Yemen including Sanaa, have launched missiles and drones targeting Israel and Red Sea shipping throughout the Gaza conflict, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed a tough response against the Houthis, as well as its main backer Iran, over the attack.\n\nIn a video published on Telegram before the reported attack on Hodeida, Netanyahu said Israel had “acted against” the Houthis in the past and “will act in the future”.\n\nIran on Monday denied supporting the attack, calling it an “independent decision” by the Yemeni rebels taken in solidarity with the Palestinian people. Reacting to Netanyahu’s threats, the Islamic republic warned it would retaliate against any attack on its territory.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 6th, 2025",
