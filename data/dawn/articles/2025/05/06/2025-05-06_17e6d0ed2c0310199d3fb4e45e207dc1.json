The two countries have held three rounds since April 12, their highest-level contact since Washington withdrew from a landmark deal with Tehran in 2018, during Donald Trump’s first term as US president.\n\nNetanyahu has called for dismantling Iran’s nuclear programme, saying a credible deal must “remove Iran’s capacity to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons” and prevent the development of ballistic missiles.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump said he would only accept “the total dismantlement” of Iran’s nuclear programme, but also signalled openness to discussing one for civilian use.\n\n“Now, there’s a new theory going out there that Iran would be allowed to have civilian (programme) — meaning to make electricity,” he told NBC News, adding that he “would be open to hearing” the argument.\n\nTehran has consistently denied that it was seeking atomic weapons, insisting that its atomic programme is solely for civilian purposes.\n\nAraghchi reiterated that if the goal was for Iran to not have a nuclear weapon, “a deal is achievable and there is only ONE PATH to achieve it: DIPLOMACY based on MUTUAL RESPECT and MUTUAL INTERESTS”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 6th, 2025",
