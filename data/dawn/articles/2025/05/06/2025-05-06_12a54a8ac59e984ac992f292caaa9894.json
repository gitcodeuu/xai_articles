  "content": "PESHAWAR: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Monday expressed dissatisfaction with an official briefing on the alleged irregularities in the official account for security and deposit funds and ordered the finance department and the accountant general’s office to conduct an internal inquiry into the matter within three days.\n\nThe PAC took notice of the issue after the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) launched an inquiry into the alleged irregularities of Rs36 billion in account No G-10113 for earnest money, security and deposit funds of local government, communication and works, irrigation and public health accounts, prompting the PAC to take notice of the issue.\n\nThe alleged financial irregularities came under discussion during a special PAC meeting, which was held here with Babar Saleem Swati in the chair.\n\nThe participants included representatives of the finance, communication and works departments, accountant general’s office, auditor general of Pakistan, lawmakers from both treasury and opposition benches, and adviser to the chief minister on finance Muzammil Aslam.\n\nAsks finance dept to immediately suspend suspects\n\n“NAB is carrying out an investigation but it always ends up in plea bargains in such cases, recovering a small amount of the actual amount,” Mr Swati said.\n\nHe raised questions about the rest of the amount, saying failure to recover it is a loss to the exchequer.\n\nOfficials of the finance department said that the funds were not consolidated and were from public accounts—an amount paid in terms of security and deposits.\n\nThey said such cheques were sent to the district account office and a monthly report was filed, with the accountant general’s office maintaining the account and submitting a report to the finance department. The officials said a fact-finding report would be produced within 10 days.\n\nAide to the CM Muzammil Aslam questioned the possibility of Rs36 billion funds embezzlement in Kohistan region, saying only Rs1.468 billion has been issued since 2019. He said that the total ADP for the entire province remained Rs594 billion between 2019 and 2025.\n\n“The adviser wants to give an impression that there’s no possibility of embezzlement of such a huge amount,” member of the opposition PPP Ahmad Kareem Kundi said.\n\nHe demanded the adviser’s resignation on “moral grounds.”\n\nMr Kundi said that responsibility should be fixed for the “scam” no matter whosoever was involved.\n\n“I am not satisfied with the briefings by departments. We will have to find out how the amount was withdrawn. The PAC will dig it out,” he said.\n\nMr Swati said that the issue was about the withdrawal of the amount from the security and deposit account.\n\n“This cannot happen without your [the finance department and accounting general office’s] involvement,” he said.\n\nThe auditor general office’s representatives said that similar cases were reported in Punjab as well.\n\nThey said that a special audit was carried out of the security account for the province’s 18 districts in 2021-2022, leading to the detection of Rs6 billion discrepancies. The officials said that due to some weaknesses, some people exploited the system.\n\nThey said the account in which the alleged irregularities were reported was a pool (collective account) of the public health engineering, irrigation, communication and works and local government departments for submitting securities for work.\n\nThe chair later ordered both the finance department and the accountant general’s office to immediately suspend all those allegedly involved in the scam.\n\n“These departments consider themselves above the law. People must know how much [of the taxpayers’] money have these departments embezzled,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 6th, 2025",
