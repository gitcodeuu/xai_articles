Three MPAs-elect of the Grand Democratic Alliance and one from JI have not taken the oath yet.\n\nKeeping in view the numeric strength of parliamentary parties in the Sindh Assembly, Mr Mehdi, the general secretary of the PPP-Sindh, is set to emerge victorious against former Senator Mirza of the MQM-P.\n\nECP officials visit PA\n\nThe Sindh Assembly has been declared as the polling station for the Senate election and all arrangements have been finalised to ensure smooth polling.\n\nSindh Election Commissioner Aijaz Anwar Chohan, who is the returning officer, visited the provincial assembly building along with polling officers on Monday and reviewed the arrangements.\n\nAccompanied by the Sindh Assembly secretary, he issued instructions to the staff concerned to make the voting process transparent and peaceful.\n\nPTI boycotts polling\n\nThe parliamentary party of the PTI in the Sindh Assembly on Monday announced its decision to boycott the by-election. A meeting, chaired by party’s parliamentary party leader Shabbir Qureshi, announced that no PTI lawmakers would participate in the electoral process.\n\n“All PTI members have been issued an official letter regarding the [parliamentary party] decision,” a brief statement issued by the party said.\n\nDeclaring the PPP and the MQM-P as “mandate thieves”, the party rejected the Senate by-elections and alleged that the two parties had undermined democratic values.\n\nIt may be noted that Senator Taj Haider had passed away on April 8 in Karachi. He was elected a senator on a PPP ticket from a Senate general seat in Sindh in March 2021 for a period of six years.\n\nOfficials said that the candidate to be elected on Tuesday will serve as a member of the Senate for a period of around two years until March 2027.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 6th, 2025",
