  "content": "LAHORE: A petitioner has approached the Lahore High Court seeking a ban on soft drinks and synthetic juices in the schools of Punjab.\n\nThe petitioner, Azam Butt, through his lawyer Rana Sikandar, pleaded that soft drinks contain artificial colours, which are used to enhance taste and are harmful to health.\n\nHe pointed out that the use of such drinks has been banned in the schools in Sindh, but in Punjab, they are still openly consumed by children at their schools.\n\nThe petition asked the court to issue an order banning the use of these soft drinks in all public and private schools of the province.\n\nPUBLIC TOILETS: The Lahore High Court on Monday adjourned the hearing of a petition questioning the insufficient toilet facilities at public places.\n\nJudicial Activism Panel (JAP) filed the petition through Advocate Azhar Siddique, pleading that ensuring the provision of public toilets was a fundamental responsibility of the government.\n\nHowever, the lawyer said, the government failed to discharge its duty as parks, bus stations and other public places lacked adequate toilet facilities.\n\nHe said the Sindh High Court recently ordered the government to ensure the construction of toilets at all public places in the province.\n\nHe asked the court to also order the Punjab government to ensure the provision of public toilets.\n\nJustice Anwaar Hussain adjourned the hearing till May 21.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 6th, 2025",
