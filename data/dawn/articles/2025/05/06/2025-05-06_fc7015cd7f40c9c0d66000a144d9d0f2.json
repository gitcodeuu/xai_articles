  "content": "MUZAFFARABAD: Kashmiri activists on Monday staged a protest at the city’s main Burhan Wani Chowk to denounce alleged Indian war crimes in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and renewed threats of military aggression along the Line of Control (LoC) following the recent Pahalgam incident.\n\nThe demonstration followed a seminar marking the fourth death anniversary of veteran pro-freedom leader Mohammad Ashraf Sehrai, who died in custody at Udhampur jail after being denied proper medical care.\n\n“War in Kashmir will be India’s last folly,” read a large banner held by demonstrators. Black flags were raised, and used tyres were set ablaze as the participants chanted slogans against India and in favour of Kashmir’s freedom and solidarity with Pakistan.\n\nThe event was organised by Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir (PHJK), an organisation of post-1989 migrants from across the LoC.\n\nThe participants, who included women, were also holding placards. “Jammu and Kashmir wants freedom from India,” read one of them.\n\nPHJK Chairman Uzair Ghazali said the Pahalgam incident was staged by India to malign the freedom movement, implicate Pakistan, and sway Hindu nationalist sentiments in the run-up to Indian elections.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Riffat Farooq, 27, said India had been “bluffing about war” for two weeks. “If they really want it, we are ready. It will be an opportunity to settle scores,” she remarked defiantly.\n\nRiaz Ahmed Khan, nephew of the late Sehrai, urged Pakistan to allow Kashmiri refugees to cross the LoC to support their brethren under siege.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 6th, 2025",
