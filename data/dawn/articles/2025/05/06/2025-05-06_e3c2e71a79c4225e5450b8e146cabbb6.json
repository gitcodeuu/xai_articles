He said that the awareness had been started and the civil defence volunteers are being trained in first aid, fire extinguishing and other rescue work.\n\nHe said that volunteers are ready to deal with any unexpected situation. He said that in 14 posts in the garrison city, there were 10 volunteers.\n\nHe said that before recruiting the volunteers, the post warden had been asked to get a copy of the identity card, a police verification certificate and a photograph.\n\nHe said the group warden will ensure that the volunteer does not have any criminal record and should not be involved in any wrong activity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 6th, 2025",
