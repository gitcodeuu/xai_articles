The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) did not field any candidate and on Monday it announced boycotting the polling process as well.\n\nIn the by-election held at the Sindh Assembly, Mehdi secured 111 votes, while MQM-P’s Nighat Mirza received 36, and two were rejected, said the returning officer, Provincial Election Commissioner Sindh Ejaz Anwar Chauhan.\n\nThe polling was conducted from 9am to 4pm without any break. A total of 149 votes were cast during the scheduled polling time.\n\nThe general Senate seat from Sindh province fell vacant after the death of PPP’s Senator Taj Haider on April 8 in Karachi. He was elected a senator on a PPP ticket from a Senate general seat in Sindh in March 2021 for a period of six years.\n\nOfficials had said that the candidate to be elected on Tuesday will serve as a member of the Senate for a period of around two years until March 2027.",
