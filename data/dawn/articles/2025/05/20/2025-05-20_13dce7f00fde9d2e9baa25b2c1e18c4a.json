But in order to succeed, we must act in a way that cannot be stopped”, justifying to his hardline supporters the decision to resume aid.\n\nFamine risk\n\nIsrael said its blockade was aimed at forcing concessions from Hamas, while UN agencies have warned of critical shortages of food, clean water, fuel and medicines.\n\n“Tonnes of food is blocked at the border, just minutes away”, WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. “The risk of famine in Gaza is increasing with the deliberate withholding of humanitarian aid.”\n\nLast week, US President Donald Trump acknowledged that “a lot of people are starving”, adding “, we’re going to get that taken care of”.\n\nA group of 22 mostly European countries, including France and Germany, said in a joint statement on Monday that Gaza’s population “faces starvation” and “must receive the aid they desperately need”.\n\nIsrael’s National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir argued against any resumption of aid, saying on X that “our hostages receive no humanitarian aid”.\n\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, also of the far right, defended the decision, stressing no supplies would be allowed to reach Hamas.\n\n“This will allow civilians to eat and our friends in the world to keep giving us diplomatic protection,” he said.\n\nIsrael’s military said on Monday it had struck 160 targets in Gaza over the past day.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
