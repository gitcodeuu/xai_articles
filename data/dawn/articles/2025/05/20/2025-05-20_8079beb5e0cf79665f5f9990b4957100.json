  "content": "KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan has initiated a nationwide “Go Cashless” campaign to promote digital payments and reduce reliance on cash transactions within cattle markets during the upcoming Eidul Azha.\n\nThis strategic initiative was officially laun­ched on Monday in line with SBP’s goal of fostering digital financial incl­usion throughout Pak­i­­s­tan. It will run until June 6, or on the eve of Eid.\n\nIn partnership with the banking industry, the ca­­mpaign aims to streamli­­ne the sale and purchase of sacrificial animals nat­ionwide in 54 designated cattle markets.\n\nFollowing the success of last year’s digitalisation efforts, this year’s campaign seeks to expand digital adoption among market participants further.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
