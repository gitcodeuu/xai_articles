According to them, loadshedding on the pretext of high-loss feeders is a form of injustice to those who neither steal electricity nor avoid paying their bills.\n\n“Currently, a severe heatwave is ongoing. Loadshedding in such terrible weather is unbearable for the people living in rural areas,” deplored a resident of rural Kasur. He urged the government to direct Lesco to stop loadshedding during the heatwave.\n\nOn the other hand, Lesco Chief Executive Officer Ramzan Butt stated that there is zero loadshedding in 95 per cent of Lesco’s service areas, including Lahore, Kasur, Okara, Sheikhupura, and Nankana Sahib.\n\n“We have a total of 2,236 feeders of 11kV in all service areas. Out of these, loadshedding (of up to a maximum of four hours) is being observed in areas served by 123 loss-making feeders. These feeders have been categorized into four types — Categories 1, 2, 3, and 4,” he explained.\n\nThe CEO further said that Category-1 loss-making feeders face only one hour of loadshedding, followed by Categories 2, 3, and 4, which experience two, three, and four hours, respectively.\n\nHe added that some areas have effectively become no-go zones for Lesco, as residents there are not only involved in electricity theft but have also attacked Lesco teams.\n\n“Loadshedding in high-loss areas is being carried out under the federal government’s policy introduced years ago. This policy has shown positive results in terms of increasing the revenue of power distribution companies,” he maintained, requesting the public to assist Lesco in identifying and taking action against power thieves.\n\nMeanwhile, a Lesco team led by the Hamza Town SDO detected electricity theft at a plaza in Karim Park, Ferozepur Road. Electricity was being illegally supplied to a flour unit (chakki), a medical store, and three houses, according to a Lesco spokesperson.\n\nThe team disconnected the illegal supply and, with the help of local police, arrested two individuals on the spot.\n\nAn application was also submitted for the registration of an FIR against the power thieves. A fine (detection bill) will be imposed, the spokesperson added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
