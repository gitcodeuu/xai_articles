  "content": "India said on Tuesday it would resume the daily border ceremony with Pakistan, which it briefly halted earlier this month following the most serious conflict between the nuclear-armed arch-rivals for decades.\n\nAt least 60 people died in fighting triggered by an April 22 attack on tourists in occupied Kashmir that New Delhi accused Islamabad of backing — a charge Pakistan denied and demanded proof for.\n\nIndia’s Border Security Force said the sunset ceremony on its side would be open to the media on Tuesday and to the general public on Wednesday at the Attari-Wagah land border.\n\nPakistan said it never stopped the ceremony, with troops marching on the Wagah border alone.\n\nThe ceremony is expected to be a low-key affair with diplomatic measures against Pakistan still in place, including the closure of the land border.\n\nFor years, the ceremony at the Attari-Wagah border has been a popular tourist attraction.\n\nVisitors from both sides come to cheer on soldiers goose-stepping in a chest-puffing theatrical show of pageantry.\n\nThe frontier was a colonial creation at the violent end of British rule in 1947, which sliced the sub-continent into India and Pakistan.\n\nThe daily border ritual has largely endured over the decades, surviving innumerable diplomatic flare-ups and military skirmishes.",
