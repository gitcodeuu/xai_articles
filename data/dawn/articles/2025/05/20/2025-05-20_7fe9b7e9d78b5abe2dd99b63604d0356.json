He said that he had been told that if he returned to the water surface before the specific duration, he would be deemed guilty.\n\nHe said that he somehow managed to remain underwater for the required duration and survived the brutal tribal ritual.\n\nBuzdar appealed to Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, as well as the commissioner and deputy commissioner of DG Khan, to take strict legal action against the jirga members.\n\nHe has also lodged a complaint with the Zain police station against the suspects.\n\nBMP Commandant Asad Chandia told Dawn that a case has been registered against the jirga members on the victim’s complaint under sections 325, 365, 452, 148 and 149 of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n\nTWO DIE: Two private sanitary workers died of suffocation while cleaning manholes of a private housing society in Dera Ghazi Khan.\n\nRescue 1122 Control Room received an emergency call about two men falling unconscious while cleaning a sewer. The rescuers were told that two men, identified as Muhammad Asif (26), son of Wahid Bakhsh, and Sabir Hussain (30), son of Basheer Ahmad, had fallen in the sewer line during the cleaning operation.\n\nA rescue operation was launched under the supervision of the district emergency officer.\n\nBoth victims were retrieved from the sewer line and given CPR; however, they were declared dead. Their bodies were shifted to the Allama Iqbal Teaching Hospital and later handed over to their families.\n\nDera Ghazi Khan Assistant Commissioner Taimoor said the deaths were the result of negligence and the administration was investigating the matter to fix responsibility.\n\nHe said the incident occurred in the private housing scheme that had hired private sanitary workers for cleaning its manholes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
