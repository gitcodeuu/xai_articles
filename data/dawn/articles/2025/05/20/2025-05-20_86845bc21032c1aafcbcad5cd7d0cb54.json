How­ever, strong winds in the area caused the flames to spread quickly, engulfing large swathes of forest land.\n\nAdditional teams dispatched by the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA), equi­pped with fireballs and other firefighting gear, have joined the operation. Despite their efforts, the fire continues to rage across the rugged terrain.\n\n“A dam located about 15 kilometres from the affe­cted area could serve as a water source for aerial firefighting,” Mr Dummor said. He added that the PDMA has initiated procedures to provide air support, including firefighting aircraft or helicopters, following a request from the district administration.\n\n“We are making every possible effort to contain the fire, which has already destroyed significant natural resources,” Mr Dum­mor said. “Personnel from the PDMA, Levies, and local communities are acti­v­ely participating in the firefighting operations.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
