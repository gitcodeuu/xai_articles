Sindh Energy Minister Nasir Shah also accompanied him.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the Sindh Information Department on Monday, the delegation was received by CHG chairman Yin Tongyue.\n\nDuring the meeting, the company expressed its willingness to install EV charging infrastructure across Sindh.\n\nMr Memon said that the establishment of EV charging stations at regular intervals would benefit owners of electric motorcycles, cars and trucks.\n\nHe also mentioned that the innovation is coming to the transportation system of Sindh and their vision is to promote environmentally friendly EV vehicles.\n\nHe added that the initiative would also create employment opportunities at the local level. In addition, an assembly plant for EV mini-trucks is being set up in Karachi, he said.\n\nMr Shah said that Chinese investors had also assured their cooperation in solar energy projects, particularly in rural areas of the province.
