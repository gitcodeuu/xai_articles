Liu reiterated that as “all-weather strategic cooperative partner” and “ironclad friend”, China would continue to prioritise its relations with Pakistan.\n\nDar arrived in Beijing yesterday on a three-day official visit on the invitation of his Chinese counterpart amid regional tensions, state-owned Radio Pakistan reported.\n\nThe visit comes as tensions remain high in the region following the ceasefire between Pakistan and India after a tense military standoff over the Pahalgam attack in occupied Kashmir, which India blamed on Pakistan without evidence.\n\nOn May 6–7, Indian air strikes in Punjab and Azad Kashmir killed civilians, prompting Islamabad to shoot down five Indian jets. After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.\n\nAfghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.\n\nPrior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\nDar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.",
