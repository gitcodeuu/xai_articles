  "content": "ROME: The fight for the Serie A title will go into the final day, and maybe even further.\n\nNapoli could have clinched its second Italian league title in three years on Sunday but will have to wait after both Antonio Conte’s team and second-placed Inter Milan were held to draws.\n\nLeaders Napoli drew 0-0 at relegation-threatened Parma, and Inter drew 2-2 against Cham­pions League-chasing Lazio to remain one point behind Napoli.\n\nPedro wrenched Inter’s title hopes out of their own hands as Lazio twice fought back to deny the reigning champions victory.\n\nNapoli host Cagliari in the final round, knowing the crown will be theirs if they match Inter’s result at Como\n\nIf they finish level on points, a playoff will be needed to decide the destination of the league title.\n\nApart from the title fight, there was still almost everything else to play for in Serie A. That was why all but one of the 10 matches in the penultimate round kicked off simultaneously on Sunday.\n\nNapoli were unfortunate not to win after twice striking the woodwork through Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa and Matteo Politano, while Scott McTominay also had a free-kick tipped onto the crossbar.\n\nThe away side thought they would be handed a chance to take the points from the penalty spot in the 96th minute when David Neres was fouled, only for the decision to be reversed for a foul committed by Giovanni Simeone earlier in the move.\n\nA feisty match at the Stadio Ennio Tardini ended with Conte and his Parma counterpart Cristian Chivu both being sent off following a blazing row between the two dugouts in the final moments.\n\nHowever a home win on the final day against Cagliari, who are safe thanks to a 3-0 win over second-from-bottom Venezia, will give Napoli a fourth league crown.\n\n“We’re close but we have more step to take in front of our own fans. We’ve been top for a large part of the season even with a lot of difficulties,” said Conte to DAZN. “It’s down to these boys who put their heart and soul into it. I really hope we can win this title because it would truly be a great achievement.”\n\nInter were perhaps under the most pressure of the two rivals as it knew a loss would hand Napoli the title if the leader won at Parma.\n\nYann Bisseck was both hero and villain at San Siro. He scored the opener in first-half stoppage time but also gave away a late penalty to allow Lazio to snatch the draw that took the title fight out of Inter’s hands.\n\nPedro had scored the first equaliser for Lazio in the 72nd minute before Denzel Dumfries headed Inter back in front seven minutes later.\n\nThat result would have sent Inter top of the table and left the Nerazzurri in control of their destiny.\n\nHowever, Lazio was awarded a penalty when it was adjudged — on video review — that Bisseck had blocked Taty Castellanos’ volley with his arm. Pedro converted in the final minute.\n\nInter thought they had snatched the win deep in stoppage time but Marko Arnautovic’s header was ruled out for offside.\n\nCoach Simone Inzaghi will also miss the final match of the season at Como — who are finishing their first Serie A season in over two decades in great form, although Cesc Fabregas’ team’s winning streak ended at six matches with a 1-1 draw at safe Hellas Verona — after being sent off for his livid reaction at the VAR check which led to Pedro levelling from the penalty spot.\n\nNo one from the Inter spoke to media after the match, in apparent protest over the decision to give Lazio their penalty.\n\nFIGHT FOR FOURTH\n\nLazio drawing kept the Roman club in the hunt for the final Champions league spot, although Marco Baroni’s team are two points behind fourth-placed Juventus who beat mid-table Udinese 2-0.\n\nNicolas Gonzalez put Juventus in front in the 61st minute, collecting a pass in the box from Kenan Yildiz and rifling his shot into the top corner, and Yildiz was the provider for substitute Dusan Vlahovic to secure the win two minutes from time.\n\nJuve are a point ahead of AS Roma, who beat 10-man AC Milan 3-1 on a night when fans honoured Claudio Ranieri in his last home match as coach for his boyhood club.\n\nRoma took the lead at the Stadio Olimpico from a corner kick in the third minute with Gianluca Mancini heading home and Milan were down to 10 men midway through the opening half when Santiago Gimenez was punished for an elbow on Mancini.\n\nMilan levelled six minutes from the break through Joao Felix but Roma were back in front in the 58th minute, Leandro Paredes scoring direct from a free kick and Bryan Cristante netted from outside the area three minutes from time to wrap up the win.\n\nMilan sit ninth and will not play European football next season.\n\nJuve visit relegation-threatened Venezia on the final day, while Roma travel to Torino and Lazio hosts Lecce, who will also be fighting for Serie A survival.\n\nBologna’s bid for Champions League football is over after a 3-2 defeat at Fiorentina which left the Italian Cup winners five points behind Juve.\n\nHowever Vincenzo Italiano’s team will play in the Europa League next season thanks to their historic cup victory on Wednesday over Milan, their first major trophy since 1974.\n\nCagliari are mathematically safe from relegation, but it’s down to the wire for Verona, Parma, Empoli, Lecce and Venezia.\n\nAnd that could also go to a playoff.Venezia are currently second from bottom after their loss at Cagliari but, on 29 points, are only two below Lecce (31) and Empoli (31).\n\nLecce gave themselves hope of avoiding the drop with a 1-0 home win over Torino courtesy of Ylber Ramadani’s strike and Empoli came from behind to win 3-1 at already-relegated Monza.\n\nParma (33 points) are only two points above the drop, with Verona a further point ahead after drawing 1-1 against Como\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
