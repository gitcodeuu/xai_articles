  "content": "KARACHI: Skipper Fatima Sana delivered a match-winning all-round performance as Conquerors defeated Strikers by 31 runs in the National Women’s T20 Tournament at the National Bank Stadium on Monday.\n\nFatima starred with an unbeaten 41 off 22 balls and later claimed 3-23 to help restrict Strikers to 110-9 in pursuit of a 142-run target. The win pushed Conquerors to the top of the table with five wins from seven matches. They face second-placed Stars in a crucial final round-robin match on Tuesday.\n\nStrikers suffered an early setback in the chase when captain Gull Feroza was dismissed in the third over.\n\nFatima then removed Zoofishan Ayyaz before Syeda Aroob Shah picked up three quick wickets, including Eyman Fatima for a golden duck, reducing Strikers to 56-5.\n\nNoreen Yaqoob fought a lone battle with a defiant 65 not out off 58 balls, but lacked support at the other end as wickets continued to tumble.\n\nEarlier, Conquerors lost both openers cheaply but recovered through a 46-run stand between Hafsa Khalid and Najiha Alvi. Fatima’s late onslaught, which included three boundaries and two sixes, powered her side to 141-5. She now tops the tournament scoring chart with 335 runs in seven games.\n\nIn another match, Challengers edged past Invincibles by seven runs at the Oval Academy Ground. Natalia Parvaiz (47) and Rameen Shamim’s late cameo guided Challengers to 161-9 before a disciplined bowling effort secured the win, keeping their semi-final hopes alive.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
