Police said the cause of the fire was not known.\n\nHowever, villagers believed that the women were busy cooking food when a burning object landed on the hay stock stored outside the tents, causing the fire to start.\n\nAssistant commissioner (headquarters) Hamza Abbas supervised the firefighting operation and the shifting of bodies and the injured to the trauma centre. He said around 300 animals were affected by the fire, while more than 50 of them, including sheep, donkeys and mules, lost life.\n\nMr Abbas said he had ordered an inquiry to ascertain the cause of the fire and assess the damage.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 20th, 2025",
