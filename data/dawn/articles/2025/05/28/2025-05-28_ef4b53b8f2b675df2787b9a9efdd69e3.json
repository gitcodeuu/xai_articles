  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Chair­man Railways Syed Mazhar Ali Shah on Tuesday anticipated the commencement of the crucial Main Line-1 (ML-1) project this year despite pending government funding while the Ministry of Railways manages to complete only six out of its 38 approved projects during the current fiscal year at a total cost of Rs260.085 billion.\n\nThe chairman briefed the Senate Standing Committee on Railways that the ministry has submitted a proposal for Rs75bn for the ML-1 project for the fiscal year 2025-26. The total estimated cost of ML-1, termed the “lifeline of the Reko Diq and Thar coal projects,” is Rs2,298.18bn. The remaining 32 projects from the current fiscal year have been carried forward to the next fiscal year.\n\nThe committee, chaired by Senator Jam Saifullah Khan, demanded details of the delayed projects in its next meeting. Committee members commended the ministry’s newly adopted strategy of completing projects partially in different phases.\n\n“The need to complete projects on time to avoid extended costs” was emphasised by the committee chairman, who also directed the ministry “to deliver high-end railway services to the general public.”\n\nMinistry manages to complete only six out of 38 approved projects this fiscal year\n\nThe committee was further informed that 12 new projects, including track expansion and safety, rehabilitation, track replacement, feasibility studies, and an upgraded security system, have been proposed for fiscal year 2025-26, seeking an allocation of Rs11.076bn.\n\nMinister for Railways Hanif Abbasi told the committee that the country was “passing through a financial crisis, and provinces should contribute to the new or ongoing railway projects in their respective locations.” He added that the ministry plans to upgrade railway schools and hospitals nationwide.\n\nIn response to a query on railway land, Mr Abbasi said “an anti-encroachment campaign has recently been initiated nationwide against land grabbers.”\n\nOfficials also briefed the committee that while Pakistan has developed locomotives and coaches capable of speeds over 160 kilometres per hour, the existing infrastructure cannot support high-speed trains.\n\nThe committee chairman then asked the ministry to conduct a feasibility study on upgrading the track system to accommodate high-speed trains in Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",
