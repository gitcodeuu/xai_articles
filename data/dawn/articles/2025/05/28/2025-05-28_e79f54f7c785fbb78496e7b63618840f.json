  "content": "President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday hailed Pakistan’s nuclear capability, saying it continued to serve as a credible minimum deterrent, as evidenced in the recent hostilities with India.\n\nWith a public holiday, the nation is celebrating Youm-i-Takbeer to mark the historic day of May 28, 1998 when Pakistan joined the ranks of nuclear powers after atomic tests in the hills of Chagai, Balochistan. Pakistan became the seventh nuclear nation in the world and the first Muslim state to have a nuclear arsenal.\n\nPM Shehbaz emphasised that Youm-i-Takbeer was more than a celebration and was a solemn reminder of Pakistan’s resolve to safeguard its sovereignty, according to his statement carried by the Associated Press of Pakistan.\n\nHe linked this year’s commemoration with what he described as Pakistan’s recent success in defending itself from “an unjustified war imposed by India”. Appreciating the nation’s spirit during the confrontation, the premier said, “The joys of Youm-i-Takbeer have further increased for a nation filled with victory.”\n\nPresident Zardari also observed: “In today’s evolving regional security situation, our nuclear capability continues to serve as a credible minimum deterrent that guarantees our peace and ensures that no one can undermine our sovereignty and national security.”\n\nIn a statement, he highlighted that the 1998 achievement was not “merely a demonstration of our technological advancement — it was a calculated decision to ensure peace through strength, to maintain the strategic balance in South Asia, and to protect our nation against any external aggression”.\n\nTwenty-seven years ago, a team of Pakistani scientists led by Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan and Dr Samar Mubarakmand carried out nuclear tests in the Raskoh Hills in Chagai, upon Nawaz’s decision in response to Indian nuclear tests.\n\nPM Shehbaz, in a post on X, said: “We thank Allah Almighty for His countless blessings and for granting us yet another glorious victory in the face of recent Indian aggression.”\n\n“We commend our valiant armed forces for their unwavering resolve and determination to defend the nation’s frontiers against all external and internal threats.\n\n“In the same spirit of unity and resolve, we pledge to build Pakistan into a strong economic power that would become the envy of the world,” the premier vowed.\n\nHe hailed his brother and then-PM Nawaz Sharif for making “Pakistan’s defence invincible with his bold and courageous decision in 1998 to go ahead with a peaceful nuclear test in the face of strong opposition from many powerful countries”.\n\nHe also paid tribute to former president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto for his “visionary leadership”, as well as “brilliant scientists and engineers who turned the vision and aspirations of the entire nation into reality”.\n\nIn his statement on the occasion, PM Shehbaz urged the nation to carry the spirit of Youm-i-Takbeer beyond defence and into economic transformation.\n\nThanking patriotic Pakistanis, he said, “I salute the nation, which made immense sacrifices for the completion of the nuclear programme and wrote a proud story of its determination and faith.”\n\nReflecting on the historic nuclear tests conducted during Nawaz’s tenure, Shehbaz noted that the decision to respond with six nuclear tests, compared to India’s five, was a demonstration of “iron resolve” in the face of global pressure and sanctions.\n\n“Mr Nawaz Sharif represented the aspirations and national interests of the entire nation … and made our geographical borders impregnable forever,” the premier stressed.\n\nThe premier also paid glowing tribute to the architects of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, including Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. He invoked the leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and said, “National history is a witness that the people and political leadership of Pakistan have always made the impossible possible.”\n\nIn his message on the occasion, President Zardari noted that Pakistan “demonstrated its strategic patience and commitment to peace” in the face of recent unprovoked Indian aggression.\n\n“Our calibrated response, under Operation Bunyanum Marsoos, was measured and effective, which forced the enemy to cease its hostile actions.”\n\nHe reaffirmed that Pakistan did not seek conflict and was committed to the principles of peaceful coexistence and respect for international law. “This day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country,” the president said.\n\nPresident Zardari also paid a rich tribute to Pakistani scientists, engineers, as civil and military leadership. He also appreciated Bhutto for laying the foundation of the nuclear programme and ex-premier Benazir Bhutto’s role in further strengthening it.\n\nAccording to state-run broadcaster Radio Pakistan, rallies were staged in Muzaffarabad and Jamshoro to commemorate the occasion.\n\nThe armed forces of Pakistan, along with Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs, also extended their heartfelt felicitations to the nation on the 27th anniversary of Youm-i-Takbeer.\n\nA statement by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) noted: “This day underscores Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to preserving its sovereignty and territorial integrity. It affirms our doctrine of credible minimum deterrence, rooted in the principle of maintaining peace and strategic stability in the region.”\n\nThe armed forces reiterated their “unflinching resolve to defend the motherland against all threats across the full spectrum of conflict”.\n\n“As responsible custodians of the nation’s strategic assets, we reaffirm that our nuclear capability remains solely for defensive purposes and stands as a guarantor of peace,” the military reaffirmed.\n\n“Youm-i-Takbeer commemorates the momentous occasion in 1998 when Pakistan emerged as a nuclear power — restoring the strategic balance in South Asia and asserting its sovereign right to self-defence,” it noted.\n\nThe ISPR highlighted that the historic achievement epitomised the nation’s resolve, unity and unwavering pursuit of a dignified and peaceful existence.\n\n“Pakistan’s strategic capability is a national trust, reflecting the collective aspirations of its people. The commemoration of Youm-i-Takbeer is a tribute to the foresight of visionary leadership, the brilliance of our scientists and engineers, and the countless contributions of all those who rendered Pakistan’s defence unassailable,” it added.\n\n“Let this day renew our collective pledge to remain vigilant, united and resolute in our commitment to the security, progress, and prosperity of our beloved homeland.” The armed forces honoured the “sacrifices that made this milestone possible”.\n\nNawaz, hailed for his leadership during the 1998 nuclear tests, posted on X: “Happy Youm-i-Takbeer to the nation.”\n\nThe ex-premier’s daughter, Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz, addressing his father, said: “The service to Pakistan that Allah Almighty wrote in your destiny, has not been shared by anyone else.”\n\nIn his message, Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah noted: “May 28 marks Pakistan’s dignity, resolve and scientific strength.”\n\nPaying tribute to Bhutto and Benazir, he asserted, “Pakistan’s defence is unshakable, we stand united.”\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Karim Kundi noted that Youm-i-Takbeer had become a “metaphor for pride, determination and dignity for the Pakistani nation”.\n\n“Youm-i-Takbeer is not just a day, but an ideology, a pledge, a message that Pakistan will always remain strong and enduring.”\n\nThe Balochistan government’s X account called the 1998 tests a “historic moment of strength, unity and deterrence”.\n\nThe PTI paid tribute to the late Dr Abdul Qadeer, saying: “The credit for making Pakistan a nuclear power goes to Dr Abdul Qadeer and his colleagues.\n\n“The entire nation is grateful to them for this great achievement. May Allah Almighty reward them greatly for it. We pay tribute to them for this great service to the country and nation.”\n\nFormer foreign minister and PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari “credited the “foresight and unparalleled courage” of his grandfather Bhutto, who “showed the dream of making Pakistan a nuclear power and provided a practical basis for it”.\n\n“Our nuclear defence is a symbol of the trust of these martyrs and their unparalleled sacrifices, and a strong shield for future generations. We should never forget how much struggle and sacrifice are behind it,” the MNA said in a post on X.\n\n“Let us all work together to build a Pakistan that is a true reflection of peace, progress and the hopes of the people.”\n\nIn a separate statement issued by his party, Bilawal “saluted the tireless efforts of Pakistan’s scientists, engineers, armed forces and visionary political leadership”.\n\nHe also remembered his mother Benazir, who, “with her sagacity and determination, protected and advanced the nuclear programme during her tenure”.",
