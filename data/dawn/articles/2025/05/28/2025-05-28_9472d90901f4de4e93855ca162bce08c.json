  "content": "LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has ordered a slew of steps to curb underage driving and improve traffic management.\n\nAs per a handout, “The father of a child driver will be held responsible for allowing him to drive underage,” she said while chairing a meeting on traffic police reforms. The meeting also reviewed a proposal to change the traffic police uniform.\n\nThe CM said: “A case will also be registered, and strict action will be taken against drivers plying vehicles with damaged or non-functional headlights.”\n\nShe expressed concern over the persistent traffic problems, saying, “There is no improvement in the traffic system. Concrete and sustainable measures must be taken. Ipersonally go out and review the traffic situation on different roads of the city. Effective measures before traffic accidents occur are the only true success.”\n\nThe CM said: “A vehicle will be stopped if a chain etc. is hanging dangerously out of the vehicle.”\n\nShe said that cases would be registered against those involved in one-wheeling or dangerous driving.\n\nApproving a proposal, she ordered a ban on parking trolleys loaded with goods on the sides of major roads besides imposing heavy fines for using mobile phones while driving. She also directed the relevant authorities to remove traffic obstacles on Bedian and other roads and instructed them to attach video and photo evidence with traffic challans for transparency.\n\nShe announced the creation of five categories within the traffic police – enforcement officer, traffic regulator, education officer, licensing officer and public service officer.\n\nShe approved the provision of modern patrol vehicles and advanced equipment for traffic police and said, “Traffic wardens will issue challans in-camera for transparency.”\n\nThe meeting also discussed the remodelling of 372 traffic points across Punjab and 77 in Lahore.\n\nMaryam directed the installation of roadside digital screens for early detection of traffic jams to improve traffic management.\n\nMeanwhile, the CM inaugurated the cattle market in Shahpur Kanjran, Lahore, during a visit there and reviewed available facilities. She was given a detailed briefing on the model cattle market project.\n\nShahpur Kanjran Model Cattle Market will have a capacity to keep 25,000 large animals and 150,000 small animals. Some 20 large sheds have been built to keep cattle in the model cattle market, which is spread over an area of 74 acres. Fans have also been installed in the animal sheds.\n\nA quarantine centre has also been built in the Shahpur Kanjran market to protect cattle from infectious diseases. Some 20 large residential rooms have also been built for cattle traders. The cattle market will also have the facility of a mosque, washroom, veterinary clinic, tuck shop and an ATM.\n\nLoading, unloading bay and truck centre have been established for the transportation of cattle.\n\nThere is also a spacious parking lot, police post and a wide open area in the cattle market.\n\nAn auction bay, along with the slaughterhouse, has also been established in the market. Punjab’s second-largest model cattle market will be built in Jhang.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",
