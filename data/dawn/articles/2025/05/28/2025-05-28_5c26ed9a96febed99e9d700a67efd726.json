They said that although protesters were peaceful and were raising slogans for the acceptance of their demands, local police at the behest of provincial government resorted to brutal baton charge and tear gas shelling against them.\n\nThey stated that several of PPP workers and leaders received injuries and were rushed to a nearby hospital. Later on, they stated, they came to know that a fabricated FIR had been registered against them.\n\nThey argued that the petitioners were respectable citizens and they deserved to be granted pre-arrest bail.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that the FIR was registered on complaint of a PTI member Engineer Arif Khan, who stated that for the last 90 days they had established a camp for the release of PTI incarcerated founder Imran Khan.\n\nThe complainant stated that his party had organised protests in the province against drone strikes killing innocent people, and he along with other workers had gone to Hasthnagri area to participate in that protest.\n\nHe stated that in the protest, he received information that some miscreants had attacked the camp and set it on fire. He added when he reached there he saw that the tents were still on fire whereas the miscreants had left the scene.\n\nThe complainant claimed that in the video footages of the occurrence, the faces of suspects were visible. He claimed that the miscreants had put their camp on fire at the behest of provincial president and general secretary of PPP.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",
