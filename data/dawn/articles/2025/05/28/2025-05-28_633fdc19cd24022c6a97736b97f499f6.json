She added that Mr Raza himself contested the February 2024 general election as an independent candidate.\n\n“Why did Hamid Raza not contest the election from the platform of SIC?” Justice Hilali asked and expressed her annoyance at Mr Siddiqi for agreeing to answer the questions but later avoiding them.\n\n“What was the philosophy behind SIC members contesting elections as independents?” she wondered.\n\nThe counsel explained the lawmakers were not candidates of SIC, but rather independent and the majority judgement classified them as such. Later, they were candidates of the PTI and not independent.\n\nMr Siddiqi said the court can grant three types of relief — set aside the majority judgement, the consequence of which would be that the Peshawar High Court judgement and the ECP’s decision will be revived. The second being substituting the majority judgement with the minority and the third being the majority judgement set aside and the appeals before PHC revived for re-hearing.\n\nJustice Khan observed that whatever record the majority judgment had relied upon was “not admissible” evidence as per the law. “No one knows which nomination papers — out of four — of these independent candidates were submitted by the ECP during the hearing.”\n\nHe reminded the minority jud­gment, which he and Justice Nae­­em Akhtar Afghan had authored, did not rely on these records since they were not admitted as evidence.\n\n“Therefore, these were not part of the record of the case.”\n\nJustice Mandokhail remarked that it should be left to the court to consider whether the right of any party was being infringed upon or not.\n\nLater, the case was adjourned till Thursday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 28th, 2025",
