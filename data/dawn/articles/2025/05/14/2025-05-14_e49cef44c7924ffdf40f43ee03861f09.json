  "content": "PTI Founder Imran Khan has applauded the people and the armed forces for their response to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “cowardice”.\n\n“I have always said, ‘mulk bhi mera, fauj bhi meri’ (this country is mine, and so is the army). Just as our soldiers defeated Modi on both aerial and ground fronts, the people of Pakistan, especially on social media, exposed and dismantled Modi and the RSS’s narrative at a global level,” Imran was quoted as saying on his X account, to which he does not have direct access.\n\n“By targeting innocent civilians such as children, women, the elderly, and civilian infrastructure in Pakistan, Modi displayed cowardice,” he added, saying that Pakistani forces responded with strength and precision.\n\n“We stand in full solidarity with the families of both civilians and military personnel who were martyred in these cowardly attacks,” Imran said, paying a tribute to the Pakistan Air Force and all military personnel for their professionalism and outstanding performance.\n\n“Unlike Modi, who targets civilians and public infrastructure, our forces successfully hit only the aircraft and installations directly involved in the attacks,” the PTI founder said, adding that Modi harbours a “deep hatred for Pakistan”.",
