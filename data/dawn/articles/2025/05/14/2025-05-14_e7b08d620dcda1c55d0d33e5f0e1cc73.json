In this part of world thousands of innocent people are being killed every year in the name of family honour on the flimsy ground of suspicion of ‘Karo-Kari’,” the judge wrote in the verdict.\n\nIt stated: “It is even observed that in order to settle the scores of enmity with rival man, the woman is killed and the said person is also killed without reasons and thereafter the male members of the community sit together and conduct a faisla declaring that since the murder was committed to save the honour, therefore, the perpetrator should not face its consequences through punishment by the court of law.\n\n“Islamic kaw under any Fiqah does not permit any citizen to take the law into his own hands and obligates the State to protect the life and liberty of every citizen and severely punish the person who does so,” the judge stated.\n\n“This uncivilised, barbaric and abominable practice must be stopped immediately before it gets out of hand and creates total anarchy in society. Under Islamic teachings the Fasad Fil Arz has been treated as a serious offence and has been described as disobedience to God, thus to avoid Fasad on earth, perpetrators are required to be dealt with iron hands,” it noted.\n\nRegarding the merits of the appeal, the bench observed that the trial court had convicted the appellant on a single count of murder under Section 302 (b) read with Section 311 (Ta’zir after waiver or compounding of right of qisas in qatl-i-amd) of the Pakistan Penal Code for imprisonment of life as ta’zir.\n\nHowever, the charge regarding the offence of “karo-i-kari’, which has been declared as Fasad fil Arz, was separately framed since it was an offence in addition to the murder. “Therefore, the conviction for the offence has to be recorded separately and it cannot be compounded or waived,” the bench ruled.\n\n“The sentence of qatl-i-amd was awarded for the charge of murder whereas sentence under Section 311 PPC was awarded for spreading fasad on earth and the prosecution has established the guilt of accused for charge of both the offences in the present case,” it said, convicting the appellant.\n\n“The appellant in the given circumstance is also convicted and sentenced for the charge of offence punishable under Section 311 PPC to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 14 years and conviction and sentence awarded by the trial court for the charge of offence punishable under section 302 PPC is maintained. Since the nature of offence is gruesome and cruel, therefore both the sentences are ordered to run consecutively,” it concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 14th, 2025",
