Najiha Alvi (39 not out off 44, four fours) and Fatima Sana (38 off 24, five fours and a six) staged counterattack with a 60-run stand but Anosha returned to dismiss the latter tilting the balance back in Stars’ favour.\n\nSyeda Aroob Shah’s eight-ball 13 including a six and a four wasn’t enough as Conquerors fell 23 runs short. Anosha, Waheeda and Neelam Mushtaq dismissed two batters each.\n\nIn the other game, Challengers posted 145-7 against Strikers after being asked to bat first. Opening duo of Sadaf Shamas (29 off 23, five fours) and Shawaal Zulfiqar (22 off 24, four fours) stitched a 47-run stand.\n\nBatting at number three, Aliya Riaz struck two sixes and a solitary four to score 35 runs off 29 balls, while also partnering with Natalia Parvaiz for a 45-run stand, which took Challengers to 111-3.\n\nGull Rukh hit one six in her 11-ball 14 not out, while Tasmia Rubab chipped in with two boundaries as she finished 10 off six.\n\nDiana Baig and leg-spinner Zunash Abdul Sattar snapped three wickets each.\n\nStrikers’ pursuit of the target was dented by opposition skipper Rameen Shamim and Sadaf, who eked out the opening batters with 25 runs on the board.\n\nEyman Fatima continued her fine batting form as she registered her second half-century as she took her team out of trouble in an 85-run alliance with Zoofishan Ayyaz (30 off 27, three fours).\n\nEyman, who has so far collected 151 runs in four outings, departed for fluent 47-ball 56 including nine fours as Challengers fought back to restrict the Strikers to 138-7 with Sadaf taking 3-31. Rameen picked up two wickets for 18 runs in her four overs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 14th, 2025",
