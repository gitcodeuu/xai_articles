  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s merchandise exports to North America rose 11.24 per cent to $4.837 billion in the first nine months of 2024-25 from $4.348bn in the corresponding period last year.\n\nThe growth was primarily driven by higher shipments to the United States, reflecting the strengthening of the trade relationship between the two countries.\n\nThe US accounted for nearly 94pc of total exports to North America, with the remaining share going to other countries, particularly Canada.\n\nAccording to data compiled by the State Bank of Pakistan, the rise in exports to the region is primarily due to a surge in textile and clothing exports to the US. Pakistan’s exports to the region dipped to $5.432bn in FY24. The exports stood at $5.17bn in FY23, down 23.28pc from $6.74bn in FY22.\n\nThe revival of exports to the region was recorded in the current fiscal year, mainly due to a rise in exports of textiles and clothing following a slowdown in exports from Bangladesh and Vietnam.\n\nThe Trump administration has enacted a 29pc tariff on products from Pakistan, primarily targeting the textile sector. However, Washington has announced a moratorium of 90 days to implement the new tariffs.\n\nIn North America, Pakistan’s exports to the US stood at $4.543bn in 9MFY25 from $4.053bn over the corresponding months of last year, a rise of 12.08pc. According to PBS data, Pakistan’s exports to the US stood at $5.442bn in FY24, which fell by 8.26pc from $5.932bn over the previous fiscal year.\n\nPakistan’s exports to Canada recorded a negative growth of 0.26pc to $293.694m in 9MFY25 from $294.466m over the corresponding months of last year. In FY24, Pakistan exports to Canada stood at $389.164m against $426.575m over the previous year, indicating a decline of 8.77pc. The imports from North America stood at $1.902bn in 9MFY25 from $1.493bn over the previous year, showing an increase of 27.39pc.\n\nPakistan’s export to Latin America stood at $58.554m in 9MFY25 against $49.696m over the previous year, indicating a marginal increase of 17.82pc. In FY24, the exports value to the region stood at $77.822m against $53.087m over the previous year, showing an increase of 46.59pc.\n\nPakistan’s exports to Central America stood at $124.978m in 9MFY25 from $129.475m over the previous year, a decline of 3.47pc. In Central America, Pakistan’s main export destination is Mexico, which saw a negative growth of 2.96pc to $95.745m in 9MFY25 from $98.670m a year ago.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 14th, 2025",
