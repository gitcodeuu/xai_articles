  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Cricket Board (PCB) on Tuesday announced the revised schedule for the remaining eight mat­ches of the HBL Pakistan Super League (PSL) 2025, set to resume on May 17 and conclude with the final on May 25 at the Gaddafi Stadium here.\n\nThe PSL was halted on May 8 after a drone attack near Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium — a part of last week’s military escalation between Pakistan and India — where Islamabad United and Peshawar Zalmi were scheduled to play.\n\nThe escalating conflict prompted the PCB to postpone the league, with all 37 foreign players returning to their countries via chartered flights. With the ceasefire in place, the PCB has shifted the remaining four group-stage matches to Rawalpindi, while the two Qualifiers, Eliminator, and final will be held at the Gaddafi Stadium.\n\n“The HBL PSL X will resume on May 17, with the final on May 25. The league will continue with six teams competing fearlessly,” PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi announced in a post on X.\n\nAccording to the revised schedule, Peshawar Zalmi will face Karachi Kings on May 17 at Rawalpindi. A victory for Karachi Kings would secure their playoff berth with 12 points, while a win for Zalmi would keep them in contention with 10 points.\n\nOn May 18, table-toppers Quetta Gladiators, already qualified with 13 points, will take on Multan Sultans, followed by a crucial clash between Lahore Qalandars (nine points) and Peshawar Zalmi (eight points).\n\nThe final group-stage match on May 19 will see Islam­abad United (10 points) against Karachi Kings (10 points), before the tournament shifts to Lahore for the playoffs.\n\nA PCB spokesperson confirmed that franchises are in talks with foreign players, with Karachi Kings’ captain and former Australian opener David Warner committing to return. However, local media reports suggest that eight New Zealand players, including former captain Kane Williamson, remain hesitant despite enhanced security assurances.\n\nCurrently, Quetta Gladiators lead the standings, followed by Karachi Kings and Islamabad United. Lahore Qalandars and Peshawar Zalmi remain in the race, while Multan Sultans languish at the bottom.\n\nThe rescheduling will also see the itinerary of Bangladesh’s upcoming tour to Pakistan tweaked. The side was to play its first of the five Twenty20 Internationals in Faisalabad on May 25, now the date for the PSL final.\n\nThe Bangladesh Cricket Board had earlier stated that it was in touch with its Pakistan counterpart regarding the revised schedule.\n\nAcross the border, the Indian Premier League is also slated to resume on May 17 after a similar postponement due to the conflict.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 14th, 2025",
