  "content": "TAXILA: The ancient Dharmarajika Stupa evoked awe and reverence on Tuesday, as monks offered rituals, recited hymns, and offered prayers at one of the holiest sites of Buddhism in Taxila.\n\nPhrasamu Sittchoke, a monk from Thailand, and Dhammaveera Thero from Sri Lanka offered rituals and prayed for world peace, especially in South Asia, at the Buddhist site dated back to the 3rd century BCE, from where the revival of the Buddha’s message of peace and tolerance flourished around the world in the 5th Century CE.\n\nThe Dharmarajika Stupa is the religious place where Emperor Ashoka bid goodbye to conflicts and started preaching Buddha’s message of peace, love and brotherhood in the 1st century CE.\n\nThai Monk Phrasamu Sittchoke said that the aim of organising the prayers at this site was to dispel the impression that the security situation in Pakistan is fragile. He said that the ancient kingdom of Gandhara, particularly near Taxila, holds historical significance in spreading Buddhism in the region.\n\nHe was of the view that Buddhists who get a chance to travel to the site consider themselves the luckiest people in the world, as the area was the birthplace of Buddha and where Buddhism originated.\n\nMonk Dhammaveera Thero from Sri Lanka said that Taxila was one of the sacred places for Buddhists, besides it was the land where, centuries ago, monks from across the Gandhara region came to seek knowledge of Buddhism and offered rituals.\n\nSri Lankan monk says site chosen because Emperor Ashoka selected this place for revival of peace\n\nHe said the site was selected for the offering of ritual prayers because Emperor Ashoka selected this place for the revival of peace and tolerance, and another reason was that the victims also included Buddhists. He was of the view that the stupa was a source of inspiration and a place of attraction since the beginning of the Buddhist religion and was later reconstructed during the time of King Kanishka in the 5th Century. He said that the history of Taxila was almost 2,000 years old and that it was taught in their textbooks.\n\n“It is an immense pleasure for us that we are part of the team preserving this heritage. The sites in Taxila are well-preserved and are one of the largest ancient monasteries in the world,” he said, adding: “It was our privilege to visit these sites as we have always dreamt of being here.”\n\nResponding to a question, he said that Pakistan had always helped Sri Lanka in the hour of need, adding that every religion promoted peace and harmony. He hoped that the Pakistani government would take further steps to promote religious tourism and appreciated the efforts of the government in this regard.\n\nPrayers for world peace, often offered in Buddhist stupas, focus on invoking compassion, wisdom, and understanding to alleviate suffering and bring harmony to all beings. These prayers may focus on various challenges, like conflict, injustice, and suffering, seeking to transform negativity into positive qualities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 14th, 2025",
