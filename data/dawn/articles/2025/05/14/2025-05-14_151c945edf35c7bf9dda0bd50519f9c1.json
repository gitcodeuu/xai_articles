However, those evacuated under official arrangements were yet to be repatriated.\n\n“We will wait another day or two before moving them back to their homes in the most vulnerable locations,” he said.\n\nTourists welcome in Neelum Valley\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy Commissioner Neelum, Nadeem Ahmed Janjua, told Dawn that the temporary ban on the entry of tourists into the valley — imposed in the interest of public safety — had been lifted in view of the improving situation.\n\n“Visitors are now welcome to explore and enjoy the serenity of Neelum Valley without fear,” he said.\n\nHowever, he advised both tourists and locals to avoid touching any suspicious device or object and to immediately alert the nearest police station as a national duty.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 14th, 2025",
