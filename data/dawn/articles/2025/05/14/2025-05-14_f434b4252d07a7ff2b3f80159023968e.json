  "content": "PM Shehbaz has said it is up to India to choose war or peace in relations with Pakistan.\n\n“We are ready for war and peace. Choice is yours,” he said.\n\nPM Shehbaz also warned India from stopping water flow after it held the Indus Water Treaty in abeyance. “If you stop our water, then it is the red line. Water is our right. The brave, valiant forces will fight for our right,” he said.\n\nThe prime minister said the Kashmir issue should be resolved as per the United Nations resolutions and then talks will be held on trade. He said trade talks cannot be held in isolation but rather through a comprehensive dialogue.\n\nHe said Pakistan has called for a complete and partial investigation into the Pahalgam attack and agreed to fully cooperate, but India responded by attacking in the dark of night and received a befitting reply.\n\nPM Shehbaz said India attacked Pakistan’s water resources at Neelum Jhelum, but the government showed restraint. He said the armed forces have the ability to destroy India’s Baglihar and other water projects.",
