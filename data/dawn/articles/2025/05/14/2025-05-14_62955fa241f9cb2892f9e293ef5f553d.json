He said that if the K-IV project, launched during the tenure of former city mayor Naimatullah Khan in 2005, had been completed on time, the city would not be facing such a dire crisis today.\n\nThe JI leader also demanded an immediate resolution of the crises, stating that residents are being forced to buy expensive water tankers while watching government hydrants supply tankers in broad daylight. He also accused the provincial government of colluding with tanker operators and “water thieves” and claimed that Karachi is not receiving its fair share of water.\n\n“The PPP has ruled Sindh for 17 years with full control of the budget and city institutions, yet it has failed to complete even a single water project like K-IV,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, MQM-P’s lawmakers in a statement called Karachi a “city without a caretaker.” They criticised the dismal state of infrastructure, saying that roads are left dug up indefinitely under the guise of development.\n\n“The K-IV project began with a few millions and has ballooned into a multibillion-rupee endeavour, yet not a single drop has reached Karachi’s citizens,” said the party statement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 14th, 2025",
