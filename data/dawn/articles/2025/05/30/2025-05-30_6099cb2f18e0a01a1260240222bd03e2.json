Yasir heads into the final ranked ninth.\n\nArshad took to Instagram today to announce his entry into the final.\n\n“Alhamdulillah qualified this morning for the final competition tomorrow afternoon [May 31] at 1:10pm PKT at the Asian Championships.\n\n“As always I would need your support and prayers,” he said.\n\nEarlier in the week, Pakistan’s fastest female sprinter Tameem Khan finished 17th in the Women’s 100m heats with a 12.14.\n\nMeanwhile, top sprinter Shajar Abbas ran a 47.17 in the Men’s 400m heats, and a 47.38 in the semi-finals, where he finished 12th.
