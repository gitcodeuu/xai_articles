  "content": "QUETTA: Opposition members in the Balochistan Assembly staged a walkout on Thursday, protesting against the federal government’s alleged decision to abolish the Levies force in the province.\n\nThe issue was raised by opposition leader Mir Younas Aziz Zehri during the assembly session, presided over by Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola.\n\nTaking the floor on a point of order, Mr Zehri informed the house that a former member of the National Assembly from the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (Fata) had written a letter to the federal government requesting the Levies Force be abolished.\n\nHe strongly protested and expressed serious concern that this former MNA had written to the prime minister, who then reportedly directed the chief secretary to disband the force.\n\nDecries federal interference in province’s affairs\n\n“Our resolutions and letters are ignored, but a letter from [former] Fata MNA gets immediate action,” Mr Zehri said.\n\nNational Party MPA Rehmat Saleh Baloch questioned the federal government’s interference, asking who the former Fata MNA was to decide the fate of Balochistan’s Levies.\n\nJamaat-i-Islami’s Maulana Hidayatur Rehman said decisions about Balochistan’s future were being made by individuals from Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, and urged all provincial lawmakers to register their protest with the prime minister.\n\nJUI-F’s Zabid Ali Reki also criticised the federal government, asking what the federation had ever given to Balochistan.\n\nFollowing these remarks, opposition members walked out of the session.\n\nProvincial Minister for Public Health Engineering Sardar Abdul Rehman Khetran responded by saying that the provincial government was making its own decisions.\n\nHe said letters are commonly received and merely noted with remarks. He clarified that the decision to convert the Levies into police in three districts was made by the chief minister of Balochistan.\n\nCM Sarfraz Bugti commented that “opposition often resorts to walkouts in June”.\n\nIn the absence of the opposition, Deputy Speaker Gola postponed several motions and notices.\n\nThese included a resolution by JUI-F’s Fazal Qadir Mandokhail to upgrade the Rural Health Center in Qamar Din Karez to a Tehsil Headquarters Hospital and a proposal by National Party’s Rehmat Saleh Baloch to create new teaching posts for mother tongue education in schools.\n\nAdditionally, a resolution by Jamaat-i-Islami’s Mr Rehman seeking equal job opportunities for madressah students, as well as various notices regarding land allotments and the stalled extension work from Sabzal Road to Airport Road via Killi Gul Muhammad, were also postponed.\n\nThe session was adjourned until 10am on May 31.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 30th, 2025",
