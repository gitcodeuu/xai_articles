  "content": "TEHRAN: Saudi authorities have released a well-known Iranian religious figure they detained ahead of the Haj pilgrimage, Iranian media reported on Thursday.\n\n“Gholamreza Ghasemian has been released and is on his way to Iran after follow-up by Iranian officials,” the ISNA news agency reported.\n\nIran said it had held consular meetings with the cleric since his arrest on Monday after a video circulated online showing him criticising the Saudi government.\n\nHis comments were an allusion to the social reforms implemented in recent years by the kingdom’s de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nRiyadh did not confirm Ghasemian’s arrest, but Tehran had expressed concern about the implications for a thaw in relations between the Middle East rivals since a 2023 rapprochement deal brokered by Beijing.\n\n“Iran in no uncertain terms condemns any attempt to harm Muslim unity, particularly in the spiritual atmosphere of the Haj,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi posted on X on Tuesday.\n\n“We are determined to not allow anyone to sabotage relations with our brotherly neighbours, including the progressive path of Iran and Saudi Arabia.” Iranian judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir had described the cleric’s arrest “unjustified and unlawful”, while adding that his remarks reflected his personal views.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 30th, 2025",
