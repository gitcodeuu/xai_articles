As one of the founding members of IOMed, Pakistan would continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” the statement quoted him as saying.\n\nThe deputy PM underlined Pakistan’s strong commitment to the promotion of peace and security as well as development. He elaborated on the critical importance of advancing and preserving multilateralism through faithful adherence to the principles of the UN Charter, full implementation of UN Security Council resolutions, as well as international law.\n\nHe also drew attention to India’s violation of international law through its acts of aggression against Pakistan and its unlawful holding in abeyance of the Indus Waters Treaty. He also highlighted the occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and the occupied Palestinian Territories as drivers of conflict to regional peace and security.\n\nDar called for the resolution of the longstanding Jammu and Kashmir dispute under the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.\n\nThe idea for the establishment of the IOMed was one of the key outcomes of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum held in Beijing in April 2019. China initiated discussions for the establishment of IOMed in 2021, and invited Pakistan to join negotiations as one of its founding members, the statement added.\n\nThe organisation is open to all countries; is based on respect for the sovereignty, core interests and legitimate concerns of every country; aims to promote dialogue and trust between parties concerned based on equality; and desires inclusion of various legal systems, and their mediators, the FO said.\n\nSeparately, FM Dar, in a meeting with the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, John Lee, congratulated him on the establishment of IOMed, according to a separate statement by FO.\n\nNoting Hong Kong’s growing significance in international mediation efforts, FM Dar highlighted the region’s role as a “global hub, linking east and west”.\n\nThe pair discussed measures to “deepen economic investment and trade cooperation” between Pakistan and the administrative region of Hong Kong.\n\n“Hailing the launch of IOMed as a milestone inspired by President Xi Jinping’s vision, the DPM/FM noted its alignment with Pakistan’s commitment to dialogue-driven diplomacy and UN Charter’s principles,” the statement read.\n\nThe foreign minister acknowledged the chief executive and SAR government for their “impressive economic and social development strides under the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ framework” while recalling Pakistan and Hong Kong’s “long-standing friendship.”\n\nFM Dar also commended the Pakistani community in Hong Kong for strengthening bilateral ties and contributing to the city’s diversity and economy.\n\nHe also took to X to announce the meeting, describing it as “cordial and productive”.\n\nWelcoming FM Dar’s visit, the chief executive expressed eagerness to enhance collaboration between Hong Kong and Pakistan further.\n\nSeparately, Dar, while speaking at a ceremony in Hong Kong, said the creation of IOMed reaffirmed Pakistan and China’s shared a view of multilateralism that is the centerpiece of international peace, stability and development.\n\nHe said that IOMed offered “new opportunities and fresh hopes to build a more inclusive, more just and more equitable world”.\n\n“Pakistan will continue to be an active voice in this noble mission,” Dar said.\n\nHe said that Pakistan would bring IOMed “not just a rich diplomatic experience, but also unflinching commitment to dialog, justice and fair play, excellencies”.\n\n“Let me commit to empower this organisation, allowing it to fulfill its potential in the service of these equity and justice I thank you all,” he said.",
