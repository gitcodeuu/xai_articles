  "content": "Karachi: Federal Minister for Petroleum Ali Pervaiz Malik has proposed the inclusion of dealers in a committee to thrash out rules related to the Petroleum Act of 1934.\n\nIn a meeting with the oil sector stakeholders at the Pakistan State Oil (PSO) head office on Thursday, the minister discussed issues like dealer margins with Abdul Sami Khan, Chairman of the Pakistan Petroleum Dealers Association (PPDA).\n\nThe PPDA chief complained about “unchecked powers” granted to assistant commissioners and deputy commissioners to inspect and seal petrol pumps. “The decision has brought anxiety to petroleum dealers,” Mr Sami said.\n\nThe petroleum minister assured the dealers that their concerns would be addressed through “constructive dialogue”.\n\nMr Malik said the government was committed to steering Pakistan’s energy sector toward greater resilience, sustainability, and innovation.\n\n“Our focus is on streamlining operations, resolving systemic issues, and fostering a balanced ecosystem that serves consumers’ interest and supports economic stability.\n\n“Enhancing fuel quality, reducing emissions and advancing the transition to clean energy are central to this vision,” Pervaiz Malik observed.\n\n“Together, we can build a modern energy sector that meets the evolving needs of our nation.”\n\nThe minister engaged with the PSO’s top management to review the company’s performance, supply chain resilience, and automation initiatives.\n\nHe was apprised about ongoing efforts to modernise PSO’s infrastructure and diversify its business model, particularly forward-looking expansion into renewable energy and emerging segments of the energy market. Mr Malik was briefed about the challenges faced by PSO and assured the company of the government’s “all-out support”.\n\nThe minister later held a meeting with representatives of the Oil Companies Advisory Committee (OCAC).\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 30th, 2025",
