I am the first Pakistani to achieve this milestone,” Zaman said in a post on X.\n\n“Zaman found his range at the front and back of the court early in the fixture and looked focused as he took a commanding 2-0 lead,” according to a press release by the British Open.\n\n“The Egyptian responded by taking the third game 11-3, firing the ball in short and capitalising on Zaman errors. In a competitive fourth, there was noting to separate the two as the score reached 5-5, Zaman established a two-point lead to pull ahead and secured the game 11-7 to win in 46 minutes.”\n\nThe main draw begins on May 31, and Zaman will face England’s Curtis Malik on June 1. The other men to qualify during Thursday’s matches were Emyr Evans of Wales, Moustafa Elsirty of Egypt, and South Africa’s Dewald van Niekerk.\n\nThe Diamond level event carries a prize draw of $348,500 each for the men and women’s categories.\n\nAs of May 1, Zaman is ranked number three in Pakistan in the men’s senior rankings.",
