  "content": "WASHINGTON: The White House said on Thursday that Israel had accepted US President Donald Trump’s proposal for a Gaza ceasefire, while discussions were “continuing” with Hamas.\n\nThe Palestinian group had earlier said it was examining a new deal proposed by Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. “I can confirm that Special Envoy Witkoff and the president submitted a ceasefire proposal to Hamas, that Israel backed and supported. Israel signed off on this proposal before it was sent to Hamas,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said.\n\n“I can also confirm that those discussions are continuing, and we hope that a ceasefire in Gaza will take place so we can return all of the hostages home,” Leavitt told reporters. The spokeswoman later declined to confirm reports in Saudi and Israeli media that both sides had reached a 60-day ceasefire agreement and that Trump was poised to make an announcement.\n\n“If there is an announcement to be made, it will come from the White House — the president, myself, or special envoy Witkoff,” Leavitt said.\n\nHamas says the proposal does not meet its demands, including an end to Israeli bombardment\n\nHamas not satisfied\n\nA spokesperson for Hamas said the proposal failed to satisfy its demands. “The new version meant the continuation of killing and famine… and does not meet any of our people’s demands, foremost among them halting the war,” Bassem Naim said.\n\n“Nonetheless, the movement’s leadership is studying the response to the proposal with full national responsibility,” he added.\n\nA source close to the group said the new version “is considered a retreat” from the previous one, which “included an American commitment regarding permanent ceasefire negotiations”.\n\nAccording to two sources close to the negotiations, the new proposal involves a 60-day truce, potentially extendable to 70 days, and the release of 10 living Israeli prisoners and nine bodies in exchange for Palestinian prisoners during the first week.\n\nThe humanitarian situation in Gaza remains dire despite aid finally beginning to trickle back into the territory after a more than two-month blockade by Israel. Food security experts say starvation is looming for one in five people.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 30th, 2025",
