Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal said that the ban on cryptocurrency was still in place across Pakistan, stressing the need for its regulation during the meeting.\n\nThe same day, Saqib had unveiled the country’s first government-led Strategic Bitcoin Reserve. In his keynote speech, he announced the establishment of a national bitcoin wallet, “holding digital assets already in state custody — not for sale or speculation, but as a sovereign reserve signalling long-term belief in decentralised finance”.\n\nCryptocurrencies are gaining momentum globally as the number of use cases is increasing and many countries are now making them legal. However, it has had a mixed reception by regulators globally.\n\nIn some countries, like El Salvador, it has legal tender status, while in others, including Pakistan, India and China, it is not accepted as payment for goods and services, nor can one own it legally, though it is not officially banned either.",
