  "content": "COLOMBO: A Sri Lan­kan express train killed an elephant and was derailed on Tuesday, despite safety measures introduced after the country’s worst wildlife railway accident three months ago on the same route.\n\nLocal officials said the young wild elephant crossing the track near Haba­ra­na was run over by the same train involved in the February 20 accident that killed seven elephants.\n\nAfter that crash, officials imposed speed limits on trains passing through elephant habitats. No passengers were injured in the accident, which occurred some 180 kilometres by road east of the capital Colombo.\n\nRailway authorities said an investigation was underway, and engineers were trying to put the Colombo-Batticaloa train back on the track after the pre-dawn smash.\n\nThe authorities had earlier announced changes to train timetables and efforts to clear shrubs from either side of the track to improve visibility for drivers, to give them more time to avoid hitting elephants. Wildlife officials have said that 139 elephants have been killed by trains over the past 17 years, since authorities began collecting such data.\n\nThe government has also announced that 1,195 people and 3,484 elephants have been killed in the past decade due to the worsening human-elephant conflict on the island.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 21st, 2025",
