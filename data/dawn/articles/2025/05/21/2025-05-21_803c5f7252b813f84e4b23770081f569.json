He said the people of both countries sought peace, which was not possible until the three main issues — Kashmir, terrorism, and water — were resolved.\n\nHe expressed grave concerns about India’s weaponisation of water and highlighted the need for Pakistan to inform the world about it.\n\nHe said that they will inform foreign governments and people that a conflict between two nuclear countries will have severe consequences beyond the region.\n\nHe also appreciated the efforts of the prime minister during the conflict, saying Pakistan demonstrated a ‘reasonable and rational role’ after India’s baseless accusations.\n\n“Pakistan was not the aggressor, we defended ourselves,” adding the world is welcoming our stance as we stood with the truth, while India built a narrative on lies and falsehoods.\n\nBilawal, in a recent post on X, announced that he was appointed by the prime minister to “lead a delegation to present Pakistan’s case for peace on the international stage”.\n\n“I am honoured to accept this responsibility and remain committed to serving Pakistan in these challenging times,” he wrote.\n\nIn a similar development, the Indian government also announced that seven all-party delegations would visit key partner countries, including members of the UN Security Council, later this month to present the country’s stance on terrorism and “project India’s national consensus”.",
