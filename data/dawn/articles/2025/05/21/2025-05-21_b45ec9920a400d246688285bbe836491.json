The protesters had blocked the Moro bypass road to record their protest.\n\nA similar programme was scheduled by Sindh Saba at the press club in Hyderabad, but police authorities did not allow it and cordoned off the main road leading to the club. Police also picked up two activists of the party.\n\nIn Moro, the protesters, armed with rods and sticks, raised slogans against corporate farming and the proposed canals. According to local sources, the protest site was about one kilometre from the residence of the provincial home minister.\n\nWhen police tried to disperse the crowd, the protesters refused to move. Police then used force, resorting to baton charge and firing into the air, which injured several protesters and pedestrians.\n\nOne of the injured, Zahid Leghari, son of Allah Bachayo Leghari, who had sustained bullet wounds, later died at Nawabshah hospital. The injured were initially taken to Moro’s hospital and then shifted to Peoples Medical University in Benazirabad, the divisional headquarters.\n\nAccording to Dr Yar Mohammad Jam­ali, medical superintendent at Peoples Medical University Hos­­pital Nawabshah, Zahid was brought dead at the facility. Others who suffered bullet injuries included Irfan Ali, Shah­meer, Mohsin Ali, Dilbar and Abdul Kha­lique.\n\nDr Jamali added that three policemen — Tahir Afzal, Abdul Khaliq and Samad Ali — were also brought to the hos­­pital, but did not have gunshot injuries.\n\nShaheed Benazirabad DIG Pervez Ahmed Chandio, SSP Shaheed Benazir­abad Shabbir Sethar, along with a heavy contingent of police from Nawabshah, Dadu and Matiari, reached Moro to control the law and order situation.\n\nAccording to police sources, several protesters were later arrested. When contacted, the Naushahro Feroze SSP was unavailable for comment.\n\nReports from local official and private sources suggested that more than four dozen activists, said to be affiliated with the Sindh Saba Party under the leadership of Ashfaq Malik, had blocked the road to protest against corporate farming and the construction of new canals over the Indus. The situation escalated into a violent clash between the police and protesters, turning the area into a virtual battlefield.\n\nBusinesses were shut, and roads were deserted. Protesters set two trailers on fire and also damaged a police van.\n\nAfter the news of Zahid Leghari’s death spread, the protest intensified. Protesters stormed the residence of Zia Lanjar, ransacked it and set fire to the parking shed and drawing room. Activists from other nationalist parties also joined the protest.\n\nThe protesters chanted slogans against police brutality and held placards demanding accountability. The situation began returning to normal around 7pm.\n\nSindh IG Ghulam Nabi Memon confirmed that parts of the home minister’s house were attacked. “We are investigating whether it was preplanned or otherwise,” he said.\n\nThe Sindh police chief added that initially 50 to 60 people began a sit-in on the road and refused to clear the blockade when asked by police.\n\n“They were armed and literally fought the police, beating them ruthlessly,” he claimed.\n\nPPP Sindh Information Secretary Ajiz Dhamra condemned the incident in a statement, calling it a terrorist act. He said there was no ban on peaceful protest, but attacking the house of a political opponent reflected a conspiracy.\n\nThe home minister directed the Nau­shahro Feroz SSP to submit a detailed report of the incident.\n\nHe said no one would be allowed to challenge the writ of the state and instructed police to take ac­­tion against those disturbing the peace.\n\nQurban Ali Khushik in Dadu also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 21st, 2025",
