  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh Assembly on Tuesday lashed out at the federal government for neglecting Sindh’s core issues, including persistent and prolonged gas load-shedding and inordinate delay in the construction of Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway, also known as M-6, which were negatively impacting daily life and economic activities across the province.\n\nSlamming what they termed inaction on key provincial issues, the house unanimously adopted separate resolutions, calling upon the federal government to resolve both the issues on priority basis.\n\nThe treasury members bulldozed two resolutions pertaining to the constitution of a commission against K-Electric (KE) and adoption of austerity measures, moved by as many opposition members, by majority votes.\n\nPakistan Peoples Party’s (PPP) Sikandar Ali Shoro tabled the resolution urging the provincial government to approach the federal government for the resolution of gas load-shedding issue in the province.\n\nTreasury bulldozes opposition member’s resolution for constituting commission against KE\n\nHe said Sindh produced over 71 per cent of total gas in the country while it required only 40 per cent of the total production. “Still, we are not given our share as envisaged in the Constitution of Pakistan,” he added.\n\nFully supporting the resolution, Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi said that the issue of gas load-shedding was chronic and the house had earlier passed an adjournment motion in that regard, but to no avail. “This is also an issue of sanctity of this house,” he said, adding that concrete actions were required to resolve the issue.\n\nPPP’s Ismail Rahu said that there were several gas fields in Badin district, but several villages were still without gas.\n\nHe said the people living in the five-kilometer proximity of a gas field had to be given gas as per the ruling of the Supreme Court.\n\nJam Shabbir Ali Khan said that gas was being produced in Sanghar, but it was also subjected to prolonged gas load-shedding.\n\nPPP’s Mumtaz Jakhrani said the entire gas distribution system was washed away in the floods in Garhi Khero, Jacobabad, and now people had reverted to the use of wood for cooking.\n\nMuttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Rashid Khan said that there was unannounced prolonged gas load-shedding in Hyderabad and people were compelled to use LPG gas cylinders at home, which posed serious threats to their life and property.\n\nHe recalled that similar resolutions against the gas load-shedding had been adopted in the house, but in vain. “Why is no heed paid to the voice of this august house?” he asked and said people were dying in cylinder blasts.\n\nThe MQM-P member said the issue of gas load-shedding would not be resolved merely by adopting resolution after resolution in the house and urged the chief minister to take up the matter with the federal government. “The matter can be resolved through table talks,” he added.\n\nHyderabad-Sukkur Motorway\n\nThe lawmaker also ripped into the federal government for inordinate delay in the completion of the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway project, reflecting growing discontent.\n\nMQM-P’s Muhammad Asif tabled the resolution urging the provincial government to approach the federal government for early completion of the project.\n\nHe said that the project had been inaugurated by the prime minister in 2022, but no ground work was carried out so far.\n\nThe MQM-P member said the delay in the project was not an issue for the province alone, but for the whole country as goods were transported from the port to upcountry.\n\nHe demanded from the federal government to allocate funds for the motorway project in the upcoming budget.\n\nJamaat-i-Islami’s Muhammad Farooq, MQM-P’s Rashid Khan, Excise Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawala and PPP’s Makhdoom Fakhar Zaman also spoke on the resolution, demanding completion of the Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway project.\n\nThe house unanimously passed a resolution to pay tribute to boxing champion Alia Soomro, who also witnessed the assembly proceedings from the visitor’s gallery.\n\nThe members welcomed Alia Soomro by thumping the desk.\n\nOpposition resolutions bulldozed\n\nOne of the resolutions was tabled by the by MQM-P Amir Siddiqui against K-Electric, demanding the constitution of a judicial commission to probe against the violation of licence awarded to the power utility.\n\nParliamentary Secretary Heer Soho, however, opposed the resolution and said that a house committee already existed to review the performance of the power distribution companies.\n\nThe house rejected the resolution by a majority vote.\n\nAnother resolution, presented by JI’s Muhammad Farooq for adopting austerity measures by the provincial government, was also rejected by a majority vote.\n\nThe JI member was of the view that the economic conditions of the country and the province were not in good shape, therefore, the provincial government should adopt austerity and reduce expenses.\n\nThe parliamentary secretary said that the Sindh government had already adopted austerity. “The chief minister now serves tea with only two biscuits,” she said in a lighter tone. Therefore, there is no scope for this resolution, we oppose it.\n\nProvincial Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla also opposed the resolution and said that the Sindh government has already reduced expenses.\n\nThe house rejected the resolution by a majority vote.\n\nLater, Speaker Awais Qadir Shah adjourned the house to Thursday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 21st, 2025",
