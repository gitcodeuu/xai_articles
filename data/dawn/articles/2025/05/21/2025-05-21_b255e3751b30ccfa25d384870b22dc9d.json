  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Additio­nal District and Sessions Judge Mohammad Afzal Majoka on Tuesday exten­ded an interim bail for former prime minister Imran Khan in six separate cases and for his wife, Bushra Bibi, in one case.\n\nThe court summoned Mr Khan either in person or via video link at the next hearing on June 17.\n\nDuring the hearing, Advocate Khalid Yousuf Chaudhry appeared on behalf of the PTI founder and informed the court that lead counsel Barrister Salman Safdar could not appear due to his engagement at the Supreme Court.\n\nConsequently, arguments on the bail applications could not proceed.\n\nJudge Majoka expres­sed concern over the repe­ated absence of the PTI fo­­­­under despite earlier ord­­ers and reiterated that his appearance at the next hea­­ring was “mandatory”, either physically or virtually.\n\nThe cases against the PTI founder stem from alle­­gations of incitement and vandalism during protests.\n\nBushra Bibi faces a case involving alleged fake receipts lin­k­ed to gifts from the Toshakhana. The court also reserved its decision on her pre-arrest bail plea, stating that the verdict will be announced after arguments on the PTI founder’s bail applications are concluded.\n\nBushra Bibi gets relief\n\nIn another developm­e­­nt, the court of Additional District and Sessions Jud­ge Amir Zia extended the interim bail of Bushra until June 17 in a case registered at Islamabad’s Ramna police station.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Judge Amir Zia granted an extension of the interim bail, allowing Bushra to remain free from arrest until the next hearing date.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 21st, 2025",
