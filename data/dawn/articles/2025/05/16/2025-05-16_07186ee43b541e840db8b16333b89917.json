  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Thursday adjourned the proceedings of the bail petitions of incarcerated Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) founding chairman Imran Khan in eight cases of May 9 riots, following a request by the prosecution.\n\nA two-judge bench headed by Justice Syed Shahbaz Ali Rizvi heard the bail pleas.\n\nDuring the hearing, a prosecutor informed the bench that an anti-terrorism court had granted permission for conducting photogrammetric and polygraph tests of the PTI founding chairman in Adiala jail, Rawalpindi, in May 9 cases. Therefore, he requested the bench to defer the bail proceedings.\n\nBarrister Salman Safdar, the counsel of the former prime minister, opposed the postponement and pointed out that the decision to conduct these tests came after almost two years.\n\nHe argued that it was not necessary for an accused to be in jail for the purpose of investigation.\n\nThe bench, however, adjourned the hearing till May 27 and sought more arguments from both sides.\n\nAn anti-terrorism court on Nov 27, 2024 denied bail to the former prime minister in the eight cases.\n\nThe bail petitions argued that the prosecution failed to establish petitioner`s association with the events narrated in the FIRs.\n\nThey claimed the petitioner had been implicated in the May 9 cases as a result of a well-orchestrated plan merely to harass and humiliate him for\n\npolitical reasons even though he was in the custody of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB).\n\nThe sole allegation against the petitioner in the cases was of ‘abetment’, which had been supplemented by the prosecution most vaguely, the pleas added.\n\nThey argued that the trial judge overlooked the fact that frivolous and baseless allegations related to the May 9 events had already been rejected due to inconsistencies in the story of the investigating agency.\n\nThe petitions asked the LHC to set aside the trial court`s decision and grant bail to the former prime minister in the eight FIRs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 16th, 2025",
