  "content": "GENEVA: A UN expert said on Thursday he was investigating “credible reports” that Rohingya refugees were forced off an Indian navy vessel into the Andaman Sea, in what would be an “unconscionable” act.\n\n“The idea that Rohin­gya refugees have been cast into the sea from naval vessels is nothing short of outrageous,” said Tom Andrews, the United Nations special rapporteur on the rights situation in Myanmar.\n\n“I am seeking further information and testimony regarding these developments and implore the Indian government to provide a full accounting of what happened.”\n\nAndrews, who is an independent expert mandated by the UN Human Rights Council but who does not speak on behalf of the UN itself, said he was “deeply concerned by what appears to be a blatant disregard for the lives and safety of those who require international protection”.\n\nThe mostly Muslim Rohingya have been heavily persecuted in Myan­mar for decades.\n\nOne million Rohingya live in a string of squalid camps in Bangladesh after escaping a 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar.\n\nThousands of them risk their lives every year on long sea journeys to seek refuge elsewhere.\n\nAndrews’s statement poin­ted to reports that Indian authorities last week detained dozens of Rohingya refugees living in Delhi, “many or all of whom held refugee identification documents”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 16th, 2025",
