Therefore, it should either be tax-free or subject to minimal taxes.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Nestle delegation highlighted various issues faced by the industry, particularly focusing on the taxes imposed on infant milk powder.\n\nThe minister also cited examples from other countries where infant milk powder is exempted from taxes, and pointed out that in the United Kingdom and Ireland, there is no Value Added Tax (VAT) on infant milk powder. Similarly, in Australia and New Zealand, infant formula is considered a basic nutritional necessity and is therefore exempt from taxes.\n\nReferring to the policies of these countries, he emphasised the need for Pakistan to adopt a similar approach so that every family can easily access quality milk for their children.\n\nThe minister urged the Nestle delegation to maximise the use of local fruits in their products to benefit rural farmers and promote domestic agricultural production. He mentioned that many rural families rely on producing and selling milk for their livelihood, and the government will make every effort to improve their economic conditions.\n\nRana Tanveer further announced that his ministry would formulate a committee to address important issues, inviting all stakeholders to participate. Through this consultative process, practical suggestions for reducing taxes on infant milk powder will be thoroughly discussed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 16th, 2025",
