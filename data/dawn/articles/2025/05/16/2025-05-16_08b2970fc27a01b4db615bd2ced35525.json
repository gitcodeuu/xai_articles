  "content": "QUETTA: JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Thursday said that neither the federation nor provinces should attempt to seize each other’s rights and resources, emphasising that his party would firmly protect provincial autonomy.\n\nSpeaking at a “Defence of Pakistan and Down with Israel” public meeting on Zarghoon Road in Quetta, Maulana Fazl wa­­r­ned rulers against steps he said could jeopardise national unity.\n\nHe asserted that Israel’s foreign policy aims to destabilise Pakis­tan, with India acting as Israel’s proxy. He praised the “fierce and well resp­onse” of Pakistan’s armed forces, saying “the people of Pakistan have avenged Gaza.”\n\nHe said that Pakistan has shown “an Islamic country has the strength to crush India’s arrogance — and similarly, rulers of the Muslim Ummah have the potential to dismantle Israel’s power”. He urged Arab rulers to “revive the warrior spirit of their ancestors and adopt a firm stance,” lamenting that actions of some Arab leaders had tarnished the Ummah’s honour.\n\nHe said JUI-F’s gatherings had sent a strong message to the US, Israel and Europe that “while Muslim lives may be taken, they will never bow before oppressors”.\n\nThe Palestinian freedom movement, he said, would continue. He criticised the alliance between Jews and Hindus and past Pakistani rulers who allegedly considered recognising Israel.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 16th, 2025",
