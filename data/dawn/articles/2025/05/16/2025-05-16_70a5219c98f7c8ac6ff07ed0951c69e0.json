A dam project near Kabul would ease pressures, but was delayed after the Taliban takeover.\n\nFor now, Kabul’s primary drinking water source is groundwater, as much as 80 per cent of which is contaminated, according to a May report by Mercy Corps.\n\nIt is tapped by more than 100,000 unregulated wells across the city that are regularly deepened or run dry, the NGO said.\n\nGroundwater can be recharged, but more is drawn each year than is replenished in Kabul, with an estimated annual 76-million-cubic-metre (20-billion-gallon) deficit, experts say.\n\n“It’s a very serious problem… Water is decreasing day by day in the city,” said Shafiullah Zahidi, who heads central Kabul operations for the state-owned water company UWASS.\n\nWater systems designed decades ago serve just 20pc of the city’s population, which has exploded to around six million over the past 20 years, said Zahidi.\n\nAt one of Kabul’s 15 pumping stations, maintenance manager Mohammad Ehsan said the seven-year-old well is already producing less water. Two others nearby sit dry.\n\n“The places with shallower water levels are dried out now,” said 53-year-old Ehsan, who has worked in water management for two decades, as he stood over an old well.\n\nIt once produced water from a depth of 70 metres (230 feet), but a newer well had to be bored more than twice as deep to reach groundwater.\n\nAt one of the two large stations in the city, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) recently procured four new pumps, where only one had been functioning.\n\n“If that pump collapsed for any reason, that means stopping the service for 25,000 beneficiary households,” which now have uninterrupted water, said Baraa Afeh, ICRC’s deputy water and habitat coordinator.\n\nEveryone in Kabul “should have 24-hour service”, said Zahidi, from the state water company.\n\nBut in reality, Bibi Jan and many other Kabulis are forced to lug water in heavy jugs from wells or buy it from tankers.\n\nThese suppliers charge at least twice as much as the state-owned utility, with potable water even more pricy in a country where 85pc of the population lives on less than a dollar a day.\n\nBibi Jan said she has to police her family’s water use carefully.\n\n“I tell them, ‘I’m not a miser but use less water.’ Because if the water runs out then what would we do?”",
