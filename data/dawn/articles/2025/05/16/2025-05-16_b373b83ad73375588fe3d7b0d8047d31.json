  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Finance Minis­ter Muhammad Aur­angzeb on Thursday reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to com­­pleting the Sukkur-Hyder­ab­ad-Karachi Motor­way (M6), calling it vital for the nation’s econo­m­­ic connectivity and development.\n\nAddressing the National Ass­e­mbly, the finance minister assured lawmakers the M6 project remai­ned a top priority and would be executed “at all costs”. He noted that multiple funding options were being explored, including foreign financing and allocations through the Public Sector Deve­lopment Programme (PSDP).\n\n“The federal budget is being fi­­nalised, and we will ensure the pla­­nning ministry is fully infor­med of the motorway’s importa­nce so that appropriate bu­­dgetary provisions are made,” he said.\n\nResponding to concerns about the motorway’s exc­lusion from the PSDP 2024-25, State Minister for Plan­ning and Development Chau­dhry Arma­ghan Subhani clarified that while the project was not in the current development portfolio, it would be prioritised in the upcoming PSDP 2025-26.\n\n“The Ministry of Com­muni­ca­tions has proposed an allocation of Rs10 billion for the M6 in the next development programme, and the amount may be revised as plann­ing progresses,” he said.\n\nHe added that multiple funding avenues, including public-private partnership models and foreign assistance, were under active consideration. “International fina­n­cial institutions, including the Asian Development Bank (ADB), have shown interest in co-financing the project, and negotiations are currently underway,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 16th, 2025",
