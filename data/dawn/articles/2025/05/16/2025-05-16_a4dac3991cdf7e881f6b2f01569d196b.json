We look forward to your participation in this significant chapter of PFF’s history as we proceed with the election of the 2025 PFF Executive Committee.”\n\nThe PFF has been under administrative control of a FIFA-appointed NC since 2019.\n\nThere is a three-way race for the PFF presidency with Taha Alizai, Mohsen Gilani and Hafiz Zakaullah vying to become the country’s first elected football chief in six years.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 16th, 2025",
