  "content": "DHAKA: Bangladesh’s Muham­mad Yunus “needs to remain” in office as interim leader to ensure a peaceful transition of power, a cabinet member said on Friday.\n\nYunus, the 84-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner who took over after a mass uprising last year, had threatened to quit the job if parties did not give him their backing, a political ally and sources in his office said.\n\nBangladesh has been in political turmoil since the student-led revolt that toppled then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August last year, with parties protesting on the streets over a string of demands.\n\n“For the sake of Bangladesh and a peaceful democratic transition, Professor Yunus needs to remain in office,” Faiz Ahmad Taiyeb, a special assistant to Yunus and head of the Ministry of Posts, Telecommuni­cations and Information Technology, said in a post on Facebook.\n\nBangladesh leader had threatened to resign if political parties did not extend support to him\n\n“The Chief Adviser is not going to step down,” he added. “He does not hanker after power.”\n\nHe later deleted his post.\n\nThe political crisis has escalated this week, with rival parties protesting on the streets of the capital Dhaka with a string of competing demands.\n\nYunus’s reported threat to stand down came after thousands of supporters of the powerful Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) rallied in Dhaka on Wednesday, holding large-scale protests against the interim government for the first time.\n\nYunus has promised polls will be held by June next year at the latest.\n\nBut supporters of the BNP — seen as front-runners in the highly anticipated elections that will be the first since Hasina was overthrown — demanded he fix a date.\n\n‘Chaotic phase’\n\nMuhammad Yunus’s relationship with the military has also reportedly deteriorated.\n\nAccording to local media and military sources, army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman said on Wednes­day that elections should be held by December, warning that Bangladesh was in a “chaotic phase” and that the “situation is worsening by the day”.\n\nTaiyeb issued a warning to the army on Friday. “The army can’t meddle in politics,” he wrote.\n\n“The army doesn’t do that in any civilised country,” he added.\n\n“By saying that the election has to be held by December, the military chief failed to maintain his jurisdictional correctness.”\n\n‘Excessive restriction’\n\nThe army played a decisive role in the ending of Hasina’s rule by not stepping in to quash the uprising, after 1,400 protesters were killed in a police crackdown.\n\nIt was Waker-Uz-Zaman who announced that Hasina had been overthrown, with the military taking brief control, before handing over to Yunus. The army issued a statement late on Thursday it said was aimed to combat those seeking to create divisions between the military and the public.\n\n“Some vested interest groups are circulating misleading information and trying to create a divide between the army and the general public,” the army said.\n\nIt released a list of the hundreds of people it had briefly sheltered inside army bases in the chaotic days following Hasina’s ouster “to save them from extrajudicial killings”.\n\nAmong those the army said it sheltered to “save lives” were 24 political figures, as well as judges, civil service staff, academics and more 525 police personnel.\n\nThe National Citizen Party (NCP) — made up of many of the students who spearheaded the uprising against Hasina, and a group close to Yunus — has previously accused the army of supporting Hasina’s Awami League.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
