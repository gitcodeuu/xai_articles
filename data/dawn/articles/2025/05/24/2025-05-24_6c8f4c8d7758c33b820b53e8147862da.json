He also noted that the original provision did not include the phrase “consent of the judge,” which was added later through amendment, and insisted that only the JCP should appoint judges to high courts.\n\nJustice Afghan remarked that these questions were now surfacing due to unforeseen developments, and noted that Article 200 existed even before the establishment of the IHC under the Islamabad High Court Act, 2010, which was enacted on August 2, 2010, leading to the court’s establishment on April 22, 2010.\n\nJustice Salahuddin Panhwar, however, pointed out that the Constitution does not specify that such transfers should be for a limited duration.\n\nJustice Mazhar cited the Indian model, where a unified seniority list of all high court judges exists and where judges must relinquish their post if they do not consent to a transfer. In contrast, in Pakistan, Justice Ahmed Sheikh continued to serve as a judge of the SHC despite refusing elevation as an ad hoc judge of the Supreme Court.\n\nJustice Mazhar also highlighted a discrepancy in the counsel’s argument, noting that if a judge takes a fresh oath upon every transfer, it would affect his seniority and potentially end his career trajectory, as he would become the most junior judge at the new court.\n\nTo substantiate his point, the judge referred to the case of Acting Chief Justice of IHC Sardar Sarfraz Dogar, who would become the most junior judge upon returning to the LHC and taking a fresh oath — despite having been 16th in seniority before the transfer to the IHC.\n\nThe hearing will resume on Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
