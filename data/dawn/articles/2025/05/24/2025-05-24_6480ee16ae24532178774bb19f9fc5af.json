Participation in international events would not only boost skills of players but will also raise Pakistan’s profile in the global volleyball community.”\n\nAfter the Nations League, the senior team will take part in the Asian Volleyball Confederation Nations Cup in Bahrain from June 17 to 24 while Russia are due to visit for a three-match series later in the same month.\n\nThe Under-19 team, meanwhile, is gearing up for the FIVB U-19 World Championship in Uzbekistan from July 24 to Aug 3 while the Under-16 side is due to take part in the CAVA U-16 Championship in Uzbekistan, that runs from June 10 to 16, and the Asian U16 Volleyball Championship in Thailand from July 20 to 27.\n\nPakistan are also due to send the volleyball team to the Asian Youth Games in Bahrain in October with Yaqoob informing that both the men’s and women’s team will be in action during November’s Islamic Solidarity Games in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
