  "content": "LAHORE: Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar has termed Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s statement that the PTI inflicted more damage than the Indian attack on Pakistan on May 6 and 7 a violation of state’s sovereignty.\n\n“Maryam Nawaz has no regard for the innocent men, women and children as well as army men and their children who died in the May 6 and 7 Indian attacks,” he said and added that the CM’s statement was actually an expression of solidarity with Indian premier Narendra Modi.\n\nMr Bhachar also submitted a resolution in the Punjab Assembly secretariat, which has also been signed by several other MPAs of the PTI.\n\n“The PTI demands constitution of a judicial commission on May 9 incidents and those who stole CCTV cameras should be caught and brought to book,” Mr Bhachar stressed.\n\nThe opposition leader said the chief minister should seek apology from the nation for statement against the Pakistan Army and Pakistan, which was no less than treason.\n\nMr Bhachar said the PTI was the largest party in the National Assembly and had over 100 members in the Punjab Assembly despite the Form-47 government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
