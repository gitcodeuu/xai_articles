In February, he fired the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Air Force General CQ Brown and pushed out five other admirals and generals in an unprecedented shake-up of military leadership.\n\nIt was the second time Trump addressed graduates of the academy on the Hudson River following his appearance in 2020 at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, when cadets sat further apart and wore masks to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nWest Point aims to educate the next generation of army leaders for a military that is meant to be apolitical and is sworn to defend the US Constitution.\n\nIn a speech full of partisan rhetoric on Saturday, Trump took credit for rebuilding the Army and referenced his tariff-fueled trade war while repeating his longstanding criticism of Nato allies for not spending more on defence.\n\n“We’ve been ripped off by every nation in the world on trade. We’ve been ripped off at the Nato level,” Trump said. “We’ve been ripped off like no country has ever been ripped off, but they don’t rip us off anymore.”\n\nThe president will preside over the army’s celebration of its 250th anniversary on June 14 with a parade on one of Washington’s main thoroughfares. The anniversary coincides with Trump’s own birthday.\n\nThis week, Trump spoke about a signature piece of his military vision, announcing he had selected a design for the $175 billion Golden Dome missile defence shield and named a Space Force general to head the programme aimed at blocking threats from China and Russia. Trump said on Saturday that the shield would protect West Point.\n\nExperts have said the Golden Dome could provoke other states to launch similar systems or develop more advanced weapons to evade the missile shield, escalating an arms race in space.",
