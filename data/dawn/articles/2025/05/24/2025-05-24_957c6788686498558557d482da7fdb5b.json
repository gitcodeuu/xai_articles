After an exchange of words between the passenger and the security official, a quarrel started between them.\n\nIn a video, an ASF official could be seen walking towards the passenger from the staff gate waving his hand during which the passenger could be heard saying: “Hold your hand saying to someone that he has been slapped by him”.\n\nThe passenger could be heard saying that when they were going back, why he slapped him. Other ASF officials could be seen taking away their colleague who allegedly raised his hand towards the passenger.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
