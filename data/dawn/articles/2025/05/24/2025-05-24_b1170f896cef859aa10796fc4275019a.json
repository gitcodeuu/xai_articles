They also threatened that they would be booked in a drug case in case of failing to meet their demand.\n\nHe said his nephew sought the help of emergency police “15” and contacted the SHO Civil Lines. Subsequently, a police team conducted a raid on a hotel and recovered the three persons.\n\nOne of the suspects identified as Ijaz, serving as a constable in Islamabad police, was arrested while Arslan, a constable of the Pindi police, and the third suspect managed to escape.\n\nA police spokesman said CPO Syed Khalid Hamdani took notice of the incident and a case was registered against the three persons, including the two police officials, for keeping citizens in illegal custody and demanding money. The Rawalpindi police official was suspended and departmental action initiated against him.\n\nThe CPO said that the abuse of authority or corruption cannot be tolerated in any case. Those who have links with criminal elements or support crimes have no right to remain in the department.\n\nEarlier in April, a group of five police officials, who turned out to be active members of a honey trap gang and were posted to the Sadiqabad police station, were dismissed from service.\n\nThe police busted the gang, arrested its 16 members, including the five police officials, and a Malawian woman of Pakistan origin who allegedly lured men through social media and later extorted money through blackmailing.\n\nOn the other hand, six officials of Rawalpindi police, including an inspector, were suspended and served with show-cause notices and charge sheets after a video on social media showed a handcuffed suspect roaming in the judicial complex Rawalpindi.\n\nA police spokesman said shortly after the incident came to light, SSP Operations Kashif Zulfiqar ordered the suspension of a police inspector, an ASI and two constables and issued them show-cause notices and charge sheet. Additionally, the SSP operations also served show-cause notices on two assistant sub-inspectors in the same case for their negligence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
