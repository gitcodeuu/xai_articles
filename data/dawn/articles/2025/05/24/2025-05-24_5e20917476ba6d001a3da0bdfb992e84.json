The restriction will apply to airspace starting from the ground to unlimited airspace height, it added.\n\nUnder the directive, no flight operated by Indian airlines or operators will be allowed to enter or transit through Pakistani airspace. However, other inte­r­national airlines would not be affected by the ban.\n\nIndia’s Civil Aviation Ministry issued a corresponding Notam, saying Pakistani-registered, operated, owned, or leased aircraft, including military flights, would be barred from Indian airspace through June 23.\n\nIndia and Pakistan first imposed the airspace restrictions last month after the shooting in India-occupied Kashmir.\n\nOn April 24, Pakistan had announced a series of measures, including the closure of its airspace to all India-owned or operated airlines with immediate effect, as it retaliated against New Delhi’s slew of aggressive measures against the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
