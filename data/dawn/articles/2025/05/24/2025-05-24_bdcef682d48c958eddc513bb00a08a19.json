  "content": "ISLAMABAD: With tobacco exports crossing the $100 million mark, the federal government has decided to streamline regulatory processes and extend policy support to sustain the export momentum.\n\nMinister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain on Friday held a meeting with a delegation of Philip Morris International (PMI) to discuss matters related to the tobacco industry’s regulatory environment, export performance and future prospects.\n\nThe minister was informed that PMI is the leading exporter of processed tobacco from Pakistan, benefiting local growers as they now prefer cultivating high-quality varieties over cheaper alternatives. Pakistan Tobacco Company (PTC) was also identified as another key exporter of processed tobacco.\n\nThe minister emphasised the urgent need to finalise the long-pending Minimum Indicative Price (MIP) notification, directing that the process be expedited to prevent financial uncertainty for both farmers and exporters.\n\n“Tobacco is a key contributor to rural employment, national revenue, and export income. Timely policy action is critical to protect the interests of growers and ensure a stable investment climate,” he said.\n\nMr Hussain reaffirmed the government’s commitment to establishing a predictable and efficient regulatory framework that encourages responsible business practices and supports long-term sectoral growth.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
