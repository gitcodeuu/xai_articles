The ticking water bomb must be defused before it goes off,” he remarked.\n\nThe PTI lawmaker said international law and UN resolutions have called water a fundamental human right for the lower riparian regions.\n\nNoting that India was violating international law by holding the IWT in abeyance, Mr Zafar said the UN Charter and resolutions and international conventions would permit any action taken by Pakistan in self-defence, including military action if India stops its share of water.\n\n“If India stops a drop of our water, the [international] law, UN resolutions and international conventions say that Pakistan can destroy the structure through missiles, planes and soldiers”.\n\nCalling the matter highly sensitive, he advised the government to be cautious while speaking about the issue because it may damage Pakistan’s case.\n\nSenator Zafar stressed that Pakistan was fast moving towards a water-scarcity crisis due to climate change and increasing population.\n\nThe Indus basin is a “lifeline” for 90 per cent of people and crops that depend on its water.\n\nHe stressed the need to rise above party lines to tackle the water issue with India.\n\nThe opposition leader, Shibli Faraz, said IWT was a settled matter and Pakistan “should not even talk to India over the treaty”.\n\n“It is a treaty and can only be changed with both parties’ consent. Otherwise, it stands as it.”\n\nNo government in Pakistan even has the mandate to change the treaty, he said, adding the government should not give a knee-jerk reaction and build up its case carefully.\n\nHe said water was a serious crisis for Pakistan and called for a “well-thought-out plan” to address it technically and internationally.\n\nPTI Senator Humayun Mohmand also said talks shouldn’t be held on IWT.\n\nThe officials “should not be apologetic on the issue”.\n\nJUI-F Senator Kamran Murtaza took a more cautious tone, saying it would be difficult for Pakistan to give a military response to a country that has an economy of $700 billion.\n\nHe said Pakistan had already lost its case over water with India at the international forums.\n\nThe JUI-F lawmaker said that a house committee comprising legal experts from all parties should be formed to examine all agreements with India, including the Shimla Agreement and IWT.\n\n‘Tyranny of majority’\n\nEarlier, at the outset of the proceedings, Mr Faraz deplored the way the Senate had been run for the past year.\n\nHe observed that democracy does not mean the tyranny of the majority.\n\n“The house has been turned into a mere post office. We have to make ourselves relevant”, he remarked.\n\nHe regretted the frequent suspension of rules and hasty legislation, saying the role of the upper house of parliament must not be compromised.\n\nMr Faraz said the house “should be run in a democratic manner” and lamented that bills were tabled in the upper house without even sharing their copies with lawmakers.\n\nHe said the culture of debate in the upper house had vanished and stressed that it was a dangerous tradition.\n\nMr Faraz said it was the opposition’s responsibility to keep an oversight on the government’s affairs.\n\nBut the ruling coalition kept key committees, including the Finance Committee, with it to “willingly and wilfully destroy this spirit”.\n\nHe asked the members to play their role in restoring the dignity of the Senate and earn respect for themselves.\n\nThe PML-N parliamentary leader, Irfan Siddiqui, who was presiding over the sitting, agreed to most points raised by the leader of the opposition.\n\nHowever, he recalled when he became senator in 2021 — with PTI in power — the situation in the house was no different.\n\nHe said only one minister used to respond to questions for all ministries back then too.\n\nMr Siddiqui agreed the question hour should be held. He said it may be taken as his ruling that any decision on the question hour in the future should be taken after mutual consultation between the government and the opposition leadership instead of taking a unilateral decision.\n\n“I also agree that we should all try to enhance the dignity of the House and ensure good presence and representation. Details about legislation should also be provided to the members well in time,” he maintained.\n\nFormer deputy chairman and PPP lawmaker Saleem Mandviwala also said the question hour should be held regularly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 24th, 2025",
