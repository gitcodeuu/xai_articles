It was true that the conviction rate by the ordinary criminal courts was low, but it did not mean that the courts did not have the will to do proper justice, he added.\n\nJustice Mandokhail also expressed regrets that the elected governments instead of addressing the politically motivated and frivolous cases, improving the system of investigation, establishing a mechanism of collecting truthful witnesses and protecting them, providing workable atmosphere, protection to the judges and improving the judicial system, expressed no confidence in criminal courts by opting to burden the courts martial with such a huge responsibility.\n\nAccording to him, Pakistan Army Act relates to members of the armed forces to ensure proper discharge of their duties and maintenance of discipline, as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and, therefore, does not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.\n\nOn the right to appeal against decisions of the court martial, Justice Mandokhail observed there was always a possibility of mistakes or errors in court rulings. He noted that an appeal to a higher, independent and impartial forum was a universally recognised tool to scrutinise the decision of fora below so as to eliminate the slightest instance of miscarriage of justice.\n\nAppeal being a continuation of trial was, therefore, an important substantial ingredient of the fundamental principles of fair trial and due process, without which, the fundamental rights of individuals would be compromised.\n\nJustice Mandokhail said the military officers presiding over the courts martial may be good at disposing military-related matters, but had no judicial expertise and experience to deal with criminal cases. Courts martial cannot be considered on a par with the judicial officers who are not only law graduates but also with the only function to deliver justice and having vast judicial experience at their credit, he emphasised.\n\nThe judicial officers were independent, impartial and without the influence, command and control of the executive, he noted.\n\nHe regretted that the federal and provincial governments, instead of attending to the causes of terrorism and taking preventive measures, were trying to achieve their goal through courts martial, which was “not a correct approach”.\n\nJustice Mandokhail was of the opinion that expecting ordinary criminal courts to convict persons without evidence and material, connecting them with the offence, would amount to violating the principle of natural justice, fair trial and due process.\n\nHe noted that the Pakistan Army Act was a disciplinary statute related to members of the armed forces as provided by Article 8(3a) of the Constitution and therefore, did not offer fundamental rights to persons under military discipline.\n\nHowever, on the effect of taking away fundamental rights in civilians’ trial, Justice Mandokhail observed that these rights were inalienable, unless expressly taken away by the Constitution. Taking away, abridging or denying the fundamental rights, had serious consequences, he observed, as it could undermine the fundamental principle of democracy, compromise the well-being of a citizen, and amount to giving a licence to the executive to abuse, torture, illegally detain and treat the citizens inhumanely.\n\nBesides, the denial of fundamental rights would have a negative impact upon the economic treaties and domestic and foreign investments, Justice Mandokhail observed, adding that violating or denying the fundamental rights could weaken the rule of law.\n\nArticle 245 prescribed the functions of the armed forces, limited to defending the state from external aggression and internal threat, while Article 175(3) mandated that the judiciary shall be separated from the executive, he wrote.\n\nAs the function of the armed forces did not include the prosecution of general criminal offences committed by civilians, exercising powers beyond the defined scope was without jurisdiction, he noted.\n\nAccording to him, indulging courts martial in adjudication of criminal cases of a general nature in respect of the general public would subject them to strong criticism in either case of conviction or acquittal, which will result in loss of trust and confidence in the army, whose function is only to defend and protect the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 31st, 2025",
