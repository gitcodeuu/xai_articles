Even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs make the irregular route — which costs thousands of dollars less — more attractive.\n\nSaudi officials said 83 per cent of those who died last year did not have official Haj permits. Temperatures of up to 44C are forecast next week.\n\n‘Unprecedented’ security\n\nTo seek out unregistered pilgrims, Saudi authorities have rolled out a new fleet of drones to monitor entrances into Makkah.\n\nSecurity forces have also raided hundreds of apartments in search of people hiding out in the area.\n\nAn Egyptian engineer living in Makkah, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said his building was raided multiple times in recent weeks.\n\n“Police officers in uniform came to my home twice and asked to see my and my wife’s residency permits,” he told AFP.\n\n“Almost everywhere, we’re being asked to show residency or work permits in Makkah. The security presence is unprecedented.”\n\nThe problem of illegal pilgrims has become acute since Saudi Arabia loosened visa restrictions in line with economic reforms, trying to attract more tourism and business. Hundreds of thousands of people are believed to have used family and tourist visas, instead of the designated Haj visa, to enter the country each year.\n\nFines and bans\n\nSaudi Arabia is now trying to cut off the problem at source, restricting multiple-entry visas for citizens of several countries since January.\n\nFamily and tourist visas were also barred to nationals of more than 10 countries, including Egypt, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and Jordan.\n\nUmar Karim, an expert on Saudi affairs at the University of Birmingham, said officials previously focused on “deterring people but not stopping them” from coming before the Haj.\n\n“Saudi authorities have seen that once these people are inside the kingdom, stopping them from physically entering Makkah is a difficult task even if a huge number of security officials are deployed,” he added.\n\nFor the past month, entry into Makkah has been restricted to individuals with work and residency permits. Many people in Makkah have been forced to send their wives and children, who lack the proper visas, out of the city. Pilgrims coming for Umrah have also been required to leave.\n\nMeanwhile, fines for performing Haj illegally have doubled to 20,000 Saudi riyals ($5,333), with violators facing a 10-year ban from the country.\n\nThose found to be harbouring and helping unauthorised pilgrims can be fined up to 100,000 riyals ($26,666).\n\n“All of this is aimed at ensuring that Makkah is reserved exclusively for authorised pilgrims during the Haj season,” the official added.\n\nResidents of Makkah told AFP that the crowds there have noticeably thinned compared to previous years.\n\nHowever, officials said on Tuesday that more than a million pilgrims had already arrived in Saudi Arabia for the Haj.\n\nLast year’s Haj-related deaths were a high-profile example of the havoc wrought by heat in 2024, which the Copernicus Climate Change Service said was the hottest year ever recorded.\n\nWhile the pilgrimage, which follows a lunar calendar, will eventually shift to the cooler winter season, relief will be temporary.\n\nA 2019 study published by the journal Geophysical Research Letters said because of climate change and the timing of the Haj, heat stress for pilgrims will exceed the “extreme danger threshold” from 2047 to 2052, and 2079 to 2086.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 31st, 2025",
