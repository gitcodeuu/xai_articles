He is being transferred from one jail to another on different pretexts, which is not only worsening his physical and mental health but is also a clear violation of human rights and constitutional principles.”\n\nThrough the resolution, the KP assembly demanded that “Ali Wazir be released immediately and unconditionally. He was provided with adequate and quality medical facilities.\n\nAll politically motivated cases filed against him will be withdrawn. All political workers are granted the constitutional rights of freedom of expression and peaceful political activity.\n\nThe government and relevant institutions ensure the implementation of Article 10-A (Right to Fair Trial), Article 19 (Freedom of Expression), and Article 14 (Right to Dignity) of the Constitution.\n\nTherefore, this Assembly recommends to the provincial government to urge the federal government to take immediate and positive action in light of humanitarian considerations, constitutional obligations, and democratic values.“\n\nMr Saif also said the cabinet also approved forwarding to the federal government the joint resolution adopted by the assembly on the issue of terrorism.\n\nThe resolution read, “The province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has been a victim of terrorism for several decades. During this time, thousands of innocent civilians and police personnel have laid down their lives. The people of the province are still yearning to be freed from this menace. The ongoing incidents of terrorism continue to pose a constant threat to the lives and property of the public.”\n\nIt added that the policy of the federal government concerning Afghanistan had proven to be ineffective.\n\n“Instead of curbing terrorism, it has led to its escalation and has also strained the relations between the two countries and their peoples. It has further complicated the situation by promoting mutual hatred, affecting trade and deteriorating law and order,” it said.\n\nThe resolution called for immediate and concrete measures to restore trust between the two nations and to establish lasting peace in the region.\n\nIt recommended to the provincial government “to urge the federal government to reconsider and immediately revise its current policy regarding Afghanistan.\n\nThe assembly also called for the provincial government’s empowerment to “play an effective role in resolving all outstanding issues through direct and meaningful dialogue with Afghanistan so that lasting peace and stability in the region can be ensured.”\n\nThe cabinet also granted its consent to forward another assembly resolution to the federal government about Indian aggression against Pakistan.\n\nThe resolution said: “The House of (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly) expresses concerns over the Pahalgam incident and strongly condemns India’s hostile actions, including threats pertaining to the Indus Waters Treaty and acts of aggression against Pakistan. The House reaffirms its full support for the government of Pakistan’s sovereign right to safeguard national Interest through all necessary measures.”\n\nIt urged the international community to take immediate action against India’s violation of international obligation and play its role in preserving regional peace and stability. “This House stands united with the people and armed forces of Pakistan in defence of our homeland.” the resolution read.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 31st, 2025",
