  "content": "KARACHI: The City Council on Friday voiced grave concern over the acute water shortages in Karachi, with opposition warning of protests if the water supply doesn’t improve within days.\n\nThe council meeting on the city’s water crisis, also attended by the top management of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC), witnessed intense discussion and protests from the opposition members who came down heavily on the water utility for its failure to ensure smooth water supply to the city.\n\nThe opposition members criticised the mayor and his team, alleging corruption and poor governance in the water utility.\n\nUnion Committee chairpersons from various towns raised complaints about water theft, illegal hydrants, tanker mafia operations, and dysfunctional water infrastructure in their respective areas.\n\n270 pumping stations exempted from power loadshedding, members told\n\nOne of the council members lamented, “We have grown old visiting the water board with no results.”\n\nOpposition Leader Advocate Saifuddin voiced strong concern over tankers’ operations and alleged collusion between influential builders and water officials.\n\n“We will not allow this forum to become a silent spectator. If improvement is not seen within days, we reserve the right to protest outside,” he said.\n\nResponding to the council members’ concern, Mayor Murtaza Wahab, who presided over the meeting for some time, vowed to end water theft collectively, noting that Karachi needs 1,200 million gallons of water per day (MGD), but only receives 500 MGD.\n\nThe mayor, who is also an elected UC chairman, left the council hall after a while handing over the chair to deputy mayor and sat among UC chairpersons on the council floor upon his return, directly addressing their concerns during the heated session.\n\nThe gesture generated spontaneous applause from members and was widely seen as a symbolic act of accessibility and solidarity.\n\n“I have come down because I believe in staying grounded. I am here to listen. I am your public servant,” Mayor Wahab said.\n\nTaking a strong tone on water theft, he said: “Those stealing water from the poor deserve God’s curse. We have shut down several illegal hydrants, but powerful interests reopened some of them. Point them out again — and I will ensure they are closed.”\n\nMr Wahab stressed that operations against illegal hydrants would only be successful with proper guidance and that the canal from Hub Dam would be completed by August 14.\n\nHe also pointed out the need to enhance the revenue of the KWSC and urged for collective efforts to resolve the city’s water and sewage problems, cautioning against negative propaganda.\n\nLater, presiding over the meeting, Deputy Mayor Salman Abdullah Murad noted the pressing issues with K-Electric, announcing that a KE delegation would be invited to the next session.\n\nHe said that the water utility was working to solve the city’s water issues, and the committee proposed by the mayor would help expedite these solutions.\n\nAddressing the council, KWSC Chief Operating Officer Asadullah Khan informed members that 270 pumping stations had now been exempted from loadshedding, but admitted that technical faults such as cable failures continued to affect some zones.\n\nHe said key installations like Dhabeji, Pipri, Gharo, and Hub were being monitored closely. “The K-IV project is now under Wapda’s jurisdiction. Our role in land clearance has been completed, he added.”\n\nThe water utility COO also assured that the BRT-aligned Nipa-to-Jail Chowrangi water line would be completed on priority and that leakage repairs were ongoing.\n\nThe meeting was adjourned to a date to be announced later.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 31st, 2025",
