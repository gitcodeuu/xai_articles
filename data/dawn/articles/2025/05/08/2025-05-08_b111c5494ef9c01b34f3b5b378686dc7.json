We held back only to avoid escalation; otherwise, not a single Indian jet would have survived,” he added.\n\nThe chief minister proudly noted the presence of athletes who had recently defeated Indian boxers at the event, further boosting national morale.\n\n“In just a few hours, representatives from all political parties stood united with our armed forces,” he concluded his speech, leading the crowd with impassioned chants of “Pakistan Zindabad”.\n\nThe chief minister reaffirmed that if necessary, the nation’s 250 million citizens are prepared to sacrifice even the last drop of their blood for Pakistan.\n\nLG Minister Ghani said that this was a unique demonstration in which all political parties were united on one platform and agenda, putting aside their political and ideological differences.\n\nHe said that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf was also supposed to attend this demonstration, but one of their [PTI’s] rallies was already scheduled at that time, otherwise they would also be here in solidarity with the rally.\n\nThe LG minister said that people from the Christian and Hindu communities were also participating in this solidarity demonstration in large numbers and they were also protesting against the Indian aggression.\n\nMQM-P’s Parliamentary Party Leader in the Sindh Assembly Iftikhar Alam said that solidarity rally was a message to Modi that the Pakistani nation was more organised than before. “Nation stands by its Pakistani army,” he said.\n\nMr Alam said that the Pakistan’s armed forces had made not only Pakistan but also the Muslim Ummah proud.\n\n“We may have millions of differences, but when it comes to Pakistan, we will together give a befitting reply to India,” he added.\n\nJI’s Muneem Zafar said that the show of solidarity by the political parties was a message to India and Modi that the entire Pakistani nation condemned the cowardly attack in the dark of night.\n\nAli Akbar Gujjar of the PML-N said that the PPP had gathered this bouquet of political parties today to express solidarity and sent a message to the entire nation that “Pakistan is our mother, if anyone casts a malicious eye on it, we will all come together and fight it,” he added.\n\nPML-Q’s Niaz Khaskheli said that India had carried out a cowardly attack and the Pakistan army had silenced the Indian Army within a few hours. “The entire nation is united with the Pakistani army, regardless of political differences,” he added.\n\nMember of Sindh Assembly Sham Sundar said that the Pakistan army had bravely fought back the Indian attack.\n\n“The Hindu community of Pakistan considers Pakistan as its motherland and we will not hesitate to sacrifice our lives to protect it,” he vowed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",
