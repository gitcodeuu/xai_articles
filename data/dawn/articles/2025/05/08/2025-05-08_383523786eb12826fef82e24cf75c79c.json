  "content": "Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has told Reuters that contacts were established between the offices of the national security advisers of India and Pakistan.\n\nHe further said that the hotline between the India-Pakistan director general of military operations was also working.\n\nIn an interview with TRT World Dar said that Pakistan stands ready to respond to any act of war from the other side “in a befitting manner.”\n\nHe added that India’s objective behind the escalation of the military conflict was to get rid of the Indus Waters Treaty.\n\n“Pakistan has the right (to retaliate) because last night, perhaps it needs clarification, we did not take escalatory mode or move. We only acted in defence.”",
