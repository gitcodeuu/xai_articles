  "content": "PARIS: Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa on Wednesday met French leader Emmanuel Macron on his first visit to Europe since overthrowing longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad, despite alarm over deadly clashes that have overshadowed the new authorities’ first months in power.\n\nAhead of the high-profile talks at the Elysee Palace, Sharaa and his foreign minister met a whistleblower who helped document horrific torture under long-time ruler Bashar al-Assad.\n\nSharaa and Assaad al-Shibani “met with Farid al-Madhan, known as ‘Caesar’”, the Syrian presidency said. Sharaa and other top Syrian officials, who took power after the fall of president Assad in December, have roots in the Al Qaeda jihadist network.\n\nThey are under pressure from Europe to show they are serious about protecting human rights as Damascus seeks the full lifting of Assad-era sanctions after 14 years of devastating war.\n\nMadhan revealed his identity in February during an interview with broadcaster Al Jazeera. He fled Syria in 2013 with some 55,000 graphic images including photographs showing emaciated bodies and people with their eyes gouged out.\n\nThe photographs inspired a 2020 US law which imposed economic sanctions on Syria and judicial proceedings in Europe against Assad’s entourage.\n\n“This meeting is part of France’s historic commitment to the Syrian people who aspire to peace and democracy,” the Elysee Palace said.\n\nBy welcoming Sharaa, Macron hopes to help the authorities on the way to “a free, stable, sovereign Syria that respects all components of Syrian society”, a French presidential official said.\n\nThe official said France was aware of “the past” of certain Syrian leaders and was demanding that there be “no complacency” with “terrorist movements” operating in Syria.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",
