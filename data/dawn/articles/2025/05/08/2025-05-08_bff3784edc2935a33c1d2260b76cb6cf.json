  "content": "KARACHI: The legal fraternity in Sindh on Wednesday condemned the unprovoked Indian attacks on Pakistani soil and urged the federal government to initiate legal action against India at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) under the provisions of the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe Sindh Bar Council (SBC) and other bar associations vehemently condemned the recent Indian aggression, terming it a “blatant violation of international law,” and warned that it posed a grave threat to regional peace and stability.\n\nThe legal community also expressed solidarity with the people, victims and armed forces of Pakistan, lauding their efforts in defending the motherland against the unprovoked attack.\n\nIn a separate statement, the Sindh High Court Bar Association (SHCBA) called on the international community to stand with Pakistan and work towards resolving the Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN Charter, upholding the right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people.\n\n“India must desist from further escalatory actions and engage in dialogue to resolve disputes in accordance with the principles of the United Nations Charter,” the SHCBA stated.\n\n“We salute the brave and swift response of Pakistan’s armed forces, who not only defended our motherland with unmatched valour but also dealt a resounding blow to the Indian Air Force, which suffered the loss of six aircraft. The professionalism and courage of our forces have once again proven Pakistan’s unwavering resolve to protect its territorial integrity at all costs,” the SHCBA said.\n\nThe Karachi Bar Association (KBA) also urged the government to initiate legal proceedings against India at the ICJ under relevant provisions of the UN Charter.\n\nIt also stated that the attacks must be prosecuted under the principle of nullum crimen sine lege — no crime without law — an international legal standard ensuring that no grave crime should go unpunished, regardless of the aggressor’s status.\n\n“Pakistan has the absolute and sovereign right to respond to Indian aggression,” the KBA said.\n\nIt demanded: “Pakistan must now exercise that right with full resolve. This is not a moment for restraint — it is a time for righteous retaliation.”\n\n“The blood of our civilians demands a response that is proportionate and unmistakably strong. No nation, no matter how arrogant, can be allowed to bomb children and expect diplomatic silence in return,” it added.\n\nThe association called for a decisive response — both militarily and diplomatically — until the aggressor is deterred and justice is restored.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",
