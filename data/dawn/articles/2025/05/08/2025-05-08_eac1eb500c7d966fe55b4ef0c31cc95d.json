Why are certain websites and media platforms being banned?”\n\nHe claimed that a mutiny has erupted in the Indian army, with soldiers deserting their posts and raising white flags.\n\nHe stated that while India has violated international laws, Pakistan’s armed forces will give a befitting response and emerge victorious.\n\nGillani delivered a clear message to India, stating, “We pay tribute to all the heroes who have given a resounding response to India in the past.” He said, “Our falcons were awake and fully capable of delivering a crushing response to any aggression from the enemy.”\n\nHe paid special homage to the party’s founder and former prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, crediting him for making Pakistan a nuclear power, which has rendered the country’s defence impregnable.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",
