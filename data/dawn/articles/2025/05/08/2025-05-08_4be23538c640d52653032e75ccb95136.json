  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The Pakistan Airports Auth­ority (PAA) announced on Wednesday that air traffic had been restored on major routes, while at least 21 airports across India’s northern and north-western regions have been closed for passenger flights until May 10.\n\nAccording to PAA, some airspace, particularly sections over Lahore, will rem­ain closed for another 24 hours due to “operational reasons,” a revised notice to airmen (NOTAM) said.\n\nThe NOTAM specified that certain airspace sections over Lahore would be temporarily unavailable at all altitudes from 10:50am on May 7, until 12:20pm on May 9, while flights taking off from or landing at Islamabad International Airport were directed to contact Air Traffic Control (ATC) for clearance.\n\nThe PAA said in a statement that it has formally conveyed its concerns to the International Civil Avi­ation Orga­n­isation (ICAO) “rega­rding the seri­ous risks posed to civil aviation safety by India’s rec­kless and provocative actions.” This followed an earlier complete closure of Pakistan’s airspace for 48 hours after a military confrontation with India on Tuesday night.\n\nWhile the PAA issued a revised NOTAM later on Wednesday, stating that airs­pace in Islamabad, Rawa­­l­pindi, and Karachi was fully restored, it reiterated the Lahore restrictions.\n\nA CAA spokesman told Dawn that “only a few routes between Lahore and Islamabad will remain closed, but other routes between the two cities would remain functional.”\n\nThe PAA also stated that all airports across Pakistan “will remain fully operational,” adding the country’s airspace “continues to be open and secure for civil aviation activities.”\n\nIndian airports closed\n\nThe airports in India’s north will remain closed till 5:29am on May 10, as per the NOTAM issued to airlines, accessed by The Hindu. The airports span Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir as well as Leh, and States of Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Gujarat. This resulted in a large number of flight cancellations by Indian airlines operating domestic routes.\n\nThese include airports at Jammu and Srinagar in J&K and Leh; Amritsar, Chandigarh, Patiala, Halwara airports in Punjab; Shimla and Dharamshala in Him­achal Pradesh; Jodhpur, Bikaner, Jaisalmer and Kishangarh in Rajasthan; and Bhuj, Jamn­agar, Rajkot, Mundra, Porbandar, Kandla, Keshod, and Bhuj in Gujarat, as per a NOTAM issued by the Airports Authority of India.\n\nAdditional airports impacted were Gwalior and Hindon, according to information posted by airlines on X. Many of these airports are used jointly by airlines and the Indian Air Force.\n\nInternational flights were among those affected by the escalated military tensions between India and Pakistan, including those of US carriers, as they couldn’t use Pakistan’s airspace to enter into India.\n\nOur Correspondent in New Delhi also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",
