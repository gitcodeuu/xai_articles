  "content": "The Foreign Office (FO) has denied claims by India that Pakistan has attacked three of its bases, branding the allegations “baseless”.\n\nEarlier, the Indian military issued a statement claiming that bases in Srinagar, Pathankot and Jaisalmer were targeted with Pakistani missiles and drones. It further alleged that Indian air defence systems intercepted ordnance and that no losses were reported.\n\nIn its statement, the FO wrote, “The Government of Pakistan categorically rejects the baseless and irresponsible allegations propagated by the Indian media, accusing Pakistan of launching attacks on Pathankot, Jaisalmer, and Srinagar.\n\n“These claims are entirely unfounded, politically motivated, and part of a reckless propaganda campaign aimed at maligning Pakistan.”\n\nThe statement noted that India’s “repeated pattern of levelling accusations against Pakistan without any credible investigation reflects a deliberate strategy to manufacture a pretext for aggression and to further destabilise the region”.\n\n“Such actions not only further endanger regional peace but also reveal a disturbing willingness to exploit misinformation for political and military ends,” the FO said.\n\nAccording to the statement, Pakistan urged the international community to take serious note of the false reports and to “counsel India toward restraint and responsibility”. It warned that any escalation based on false pretences would be met with “full resolve and determination to safeguard Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity”.\n\n“Pakistan remains vigilant and firmly committed to peace, but it will not be deterred by attempts to provoke, intimidate, or mislead and reserves the right to respond to acts of aggression. These allegations are rejected in the strongest possible terms,” the statement concluded.",
