The Green Sukuk will attract a broader investor base, deepen financial markets, and accelerate the country’s transition to a green and resilient economy.\n\nThe Rs50bn two-phased sukuk is targeted to fund additional requirements of three small dam-cum-hydropower projects, Garuk in Balochistan, Nai Gaj in Sindh and Shagarthang in Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",
