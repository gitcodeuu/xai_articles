  "content": "MANSEHRA: The Balakot police on Wednesday arrested an Afghan national for attempting to kidnap a first-grade schoolgirl.\n\n“Police personnel followed the kidnapper and arrested him while he was trying to flee through less-frequented routes,” DSP Saddaqat Nisar told a news conference in Balakot.\n\nHe said the girl was on the way to her school in the morning when the Afghan national, Abdul Qadeer, tried to “lure” her away, but she cried for help, prompting him to flee.\n\n“The girl’s mother and neighbours immediately approached the police and lodged an FIR against the kidnapper,” he said.\n\nProbe reveals detainee wanted for several criminal activities\n\nThe DSPsaid that a police team, led by SHO of the Balakot Police Station Fahad Shah, launched a search operation after the city’s entry and exit points were sealed, and apprehended the suspect from the Shawal area within two hours.\n\n“The police cordoned off the entire area and checked both public and private vehicles leaving Balakot,” he said.\n\nMr Nisar said a preliminary investigation revealed that the detainee lived in the Pakhwal area of Mansehra district and was wanted for several criminal activities.\n\nHe urged residents to remain vigilant, especially about the safety of their children when they go to school or play on the streets.\n\nMeanwhile, the police have arrested Mohammad Iqbal alias Bala Gujjar, wanted in dozens of cases of murder, attempted murder and kidnapping for extortion.\n\nA police team raided a house hereon a tip-off and arrested the outlaw.\n\nThe police said the detainee remained in custody in the past, too, in extortion cases.\n\nOFFICE RELOCATION DEMANDED: Representatives of local bodies and other residents of Oghi tehsil on Wednesday urged the government to relocate the offices of the sub-divisional education officer (female) to an easily accessible place.\n\n“Women teachers who travel from across the tehsil for official and personal matters face difficulties and have to spend extra money to reach the current office,” resident Haq Nawaz told reporters in Oghi.\n\nA group of residents and local body representatives led by Mr Nawaz said they had raised the issue repeatedly with the local MPA and education department officials, but no action had been taken so far.\n\n“The government has already been paying rent for the building where the SDEO (female) office is located, but it is far from the city and not easily accessible,” he said.\n\nAnother local, Sohail Khan, said that teachers and applicants from across the tehsil had to spend as much as Rs200 just to reach the office for simple tasks like making a photocopy worth Rs5.\n\n“Our social norms discourage female teachers from travelling alone to such remote areas, and the added transportation cost only makes it worse. If the government fails to relocate offices to the city or nearby areas, we will take to the streets in protest.” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Deputy Superintendent of Police in Oghi Waheed Khan has directed investigation officers to ensure a “clear and thorough” probe into criminal cases to prevent suspects from escaping justice.\n\nAddressing a meeting attended by SHOs and investigation officers from across the tehsil, the DSP said a weak and unprofessional approach in FIR registrations benefitted suspects, so that practice should come to an end.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 8th, 2025",
