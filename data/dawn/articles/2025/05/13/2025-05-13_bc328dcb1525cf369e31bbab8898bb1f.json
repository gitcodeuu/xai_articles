They included 12 in Kotli, six each in Bhimber and Poonch, three in Muzaffarabad, two each in Neelum and Haveli, and one in Bagh. Another 123 people were injured in the hostilities.\n\nSchool, colleges reopen today\n\nThe AJK government annou­nced the reopening of all educational institutions from today (Tuesday), following a temporary closure amid the escalation.\n\nHowever, a revised schedule for the postponed examination papers will be issued separately by the AJK Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) in Mirpur, Mr Khan said.\n\nEarlier on Monday, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq visited forward posts in the Barnala sector of Bhimber district to express solidarity with the armed forces for their robust response to Indian aggression and to console families affected by the shelling.\n\nAddressing the troops, Mr Haq lauded the army’s professionalism and high morale, stating that ‘Operation Bunyanum Marsoos’ had forced the Indian forces to back down.\n\n“The Pakistan Army has made the country’s defence invincible,” he remarked, also praising the Pakistan Air Force for showcasing its capabilities with international recognition.\n\nHe condemned India’s targeting of civilian populations and infrastructure, and applauded the resilience and bravery of the AJK people.\n\nHe said compensation had been provided to the families of martyrs and injured persons within 24 hours, and that relevant departments remained fully alert and operational round-the-clock.\n\nThe prime minister pledged to personally visit all LoC-affected areas to assess damages and ensure timely relief and rehabilitation.\n\nDuring his visit, Mr Haq met with the families of those martyred in Saturday’s shelling, offering condolences and handing over compensation cheques. As his convoy passed through the area, large crowds chanted slogans in support of Pakistan, the armed forces, and the AJK leadership.\n\nPresident for immediate relief to affected families\n\nSeparately, AJK President Barrister Sultan Mahmood strongly condemned India for deliberately targeting innocent and unarmed civilians along the LoC, calling it a blatant display of frustration.\n\nExpressing heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and wishing a swift recovery to the injured, he directed the government and relevant authorities to urgently assess the damages and ensure immediate relief for the affected population, including uninterrupted medical care for the wounded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 13th, 2025",
