Al Jazeera accused the PA, which has partial administrative control in the West Bank, of “attempting to deter Al Jazeera from covering escalating events in the occupied Palestinian territories” including in Jenin and its refugee camp.\n\nAt the time of the channel’s suspension, PA security forces had been engaged in weeks of deadly clashes with militants in Jenin, in the northern West Bank.\n\nAl Jazeera remains banned from broadcasting from Israel, since a long-running feud with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government prompted his government to order the channel’s closure in May 2024.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 13th, 2025",
