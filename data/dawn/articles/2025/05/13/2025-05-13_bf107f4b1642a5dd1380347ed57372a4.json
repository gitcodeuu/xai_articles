And they’ll treat his family members as past and future business partners”, he said.\n\nIsrael is threatening military action against Iran while US President Donald Trump pursues diplomacy, exposing a growing rift between the long-time allies over how to confront the Islamic Republic’s advancing nuclear programme.\n\nAs a fourth round of indirect talks between Iran and the US kicked off in Muscat on Sunday, Israel’s Foreign Minister Gideon Saar emphasised that his country would not allow Tehran, under any circumstances, to develop its nuclear programme.\n\n“The most dangerous regime must not be allowed to obtain the world’s most dangerous weapon,” said Saar.\n\nLike Western countries, Israel suspects its arch foe Iran of wanting to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\nTehran denies these allegations, defending its right to civilian nuclear energy.\n\n“If military operations are necessary […] so be it,” said Israeli President Isaac Herzog in an interview published this week by the German newspaper Die Welt, while also stating that he wanted to give “dialogue a chance”.\n\nIn 2015, Iran and several major powers signed an agreement regulating Tehran’s nuclear development, including uranium enrichment, in exchange for the gradual lifting of sanctions that had been imposed on the country since the mid-2000s.\n\nHowever, in 2018, the United States, during Trump’s first term, withdrew from the agreement, rendering the deal largely ineffective.\n\nSince then, Iran has resumed much of its nuclear activities.\n\nThe country is now enriching uranium up to 60 per cent, well above the 3.67pc limit set by the agreement, but still below the 90pc threshold required for making nuclear weapons, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n\nSince his return to the White House, Trump has initiated new negotiations, which Israel opposes.\n\nIsraeli officials have also expressed irritation at another agreement made behind their backs between Washington and Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\n“Israel insists that the [nuclear] agreement be much more comprehensive [than the one in 2015] and that Iran not be allowed to domestically enrich uranium,” geopolitical analyst Michael Horowitz told AFP.\n\nAccording to him, Israeli authorities now believe that “Tehran can quickly develop a weapon if it chooses to.”\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who applauded Trump’s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, has emphasised that Israel is prepared to use all means necessary to stop the Islamic Republic from developing its nuclear capacity.\n\n“The deal that truly works is the one that eliminates Iran’s ability to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons,” he said in late April, urging for the complete “dismantling” of the nuclear programme.\n\n“There are currently many voices in Israel suggesting that there is a window of opportunity to use military force if necessary,” said Raz Zimmt, director of Iran studies at the Institute for National Security Studies (INSS) in Tel Aviv.\n\nAccording to him, the idea of strikes on Iranian nuclear infrastructure is motivated by two factors.\n\nThe first being the perception that Iran has been weakened after Israel targeted its defence systems in October 2024.\n\nSecondly, the fact that Hezbollah is also diminished after its conflict with Israel in 2024, and thus “incapable of retaliating” to defend Tehran, its major ally.\n\nExperts interviewed by AFP say that if Israel were to strike Iranian nuclear sites, the United States would likely be expected — at the very least — to be ready to defend Israel in the event of Iranian retaliation.\n\n“A strike with the support or even participation of Washington can be much more effective,” said Horowitz.\n\n“Trump’s positions are putting Israel in an awkward position: he (Netanyahu) doesn’t want to be at odds with the new administration, but he is beginning to understand that Trump wants a deal at all costs.”\n\nZimmt says, however, that “it is highly unlikely that Netanyahu would oppose Trump” if the latter signed an agreement with Iran.",
