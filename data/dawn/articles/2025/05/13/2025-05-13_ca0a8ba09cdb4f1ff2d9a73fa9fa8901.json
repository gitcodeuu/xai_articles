It lacked full context and unintentionally overstated the emotions involved.\n\n“I sincerely regret any misunderstanding it may have caused. I’ve offered an unconditional apology to Daryl Mitchell and Tom Curran. I hold deep respect for my fellow teammates and truly value the Qalandars brotherhood — where we always stand by one another, no matter what.\n\n“I look forward to rejoining my team when the Pakistan Super League resumes.”\n\nMitchell, who has also featured in the IPL, had earlier refuted Hossain’s claims.\n\n“Both the PSL and IPL have played major roles in my career, and I’ve always cherished my time in both tournaments,” he said. “I hope peace prevails and we can get back to playing the game we love and continue giving back to the amazing people who support us.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 13th, 2025",
