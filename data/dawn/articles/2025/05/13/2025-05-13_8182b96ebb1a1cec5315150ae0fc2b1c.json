It urged the authorities to actively engage the international community to resolve the issue of Indian occupied Kashmir dispute in accordance with the aspirations of locals and the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions.\n\nStressing the importance of the Indus Waters Treaty, the House resolved to continue to play its constitutional role in safeguarding national interest and promoting peace, unity and security for the people of Pakistan and the region.\n\nThe resolution expressed gratitude to Almighty Allah “for granting the Pakistani nation dignity and honour in defending the motherland’s territorial integrity against the unjustified and naked Indian aggression”.\n\nIt congratulated the nation, which “rose above all differences and stood united behind its leadership across the political spectrum with one voice”.\n\nThe House commended the armed forces for their “exemplary professionalism, vigilance and courage” in defending the sovereignty of Pakistan.\n\nThe House resolution also paid tribute to the martyrs who “laid down their lives in defence of the motherland” and acknowledged their “supreme sacrifice” as a symbol of national pride, resilience and unity.\n\nIt expressed sincere gratitude to the friendly countries for their support to Pakistan at this critical juncture.\n\nPhase-wise privatisation\n\nEarlier, the assembly was informed that the federal government has approved the privatisation of 24 state-owned enterprises (SOEs).\n\nParliamentary Secretary Aasia Ishaque Siddiqui briefed the members on privatisation during the question hour.\n\nShe said the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), First Women Bank and several power and financial institutions were set to be privatised in the first phase.\n\nShe said the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation, in its meeting on August 2, 2024, approved a plan for phase-wise privatisation of 24 public sector organisations.\n\nThe process will be conducted in three phases over the next five years, Ms Siddiqui said, adding the first phase will be completed within a year, the second within one to three years and the third in three to five years.\n\nIn the first phase, the privatisation of PIA, First Women Bank, House Building Finance Corporation, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, Pakistan Engineering Company, Islamabad Electric Supply Company, Gujranwala Electric Power Company, Faisalabad Electric Supply Company and Sindh Engineering Limited will take place.\n\nIn the second phase, State Life Insurance Corporation, Pakistan Reinsurance Company, Central Power Generation Company, Jamshoro Power Company, Northern Power Generation Company, and Lakhra Power Generation Company will be privatised.
