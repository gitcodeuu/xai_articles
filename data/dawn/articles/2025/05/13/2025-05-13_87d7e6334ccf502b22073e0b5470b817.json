This must stop,” Justice Minhas remarked, emphasising that delivery personnel had become a conduit for narcotics entering campuses.\n\n“You must implement this order immediately and submit a compliance report by the next hearing,” the judge directed the concerned authorities.\n\nThe court also summoned a report from the secretary cabinet on whether the National Anti-Narcotics Council, a high-powered body involving the prime minister and all the four chief ministers, had been constituted. Justice Minhas questioned the delay in establishing the council and its critical role in national drug control efforts.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the Islamabad police apologised for a previously submitted report, which had downplayed the urgency of the issue.\n\nThe judge reprimanded the police for prioritising VIP security over student safety and issued a show-cause notice to the assistant inspector general (operations) to explain the stance.\n\nAccording to the police report, surveillance had been increased at over 1,000 institutions, and collaboration with the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) had led to 577 drug-related cases since 2019. However, the previously submitted report admitted that VIP protection remained a higher priority, limiting resources for anti-drug operations.\n\nThe petitioner’s counsel, Kashif Ali Malik, cited data showing a disturbing trend: between 43–53pc of students in elite schools reportedly used drugs with heroin, hashish, and methamphetamine being the most common. He urged the government to focus on educational interventions rather than just policing, adding the curriculum must address drug awareness.\n\nThe court was informed that the Ministry of Education had included drug prevention material in the current curriculum with plans to expand this in future editions.\n\nJustice Minhas urged swift and decisive action to protect students, stating: “This is not just a law and order issue, it’s about the future of our youth.”\n\nThe hearing was adjourned until May 28 with orders for a detailed compliance report on delivery restrictions and institutional accountability.\n\nIt may be recalled that the National Assembly Standing Committee on Human Rights in its meeting on January 2 had voiced concerns over the rising incidents of child begging, child abuse, and drug use in both private and government educational institutions and directed the Ministry of Human Rights and the National Commission on the Rights of Child to take measures to combat these growing social evils.\n\nThe committee had also urged the Ministry of Human Rights to collaborate with the Ministry of Education to raise awareness about the dangers of drug use, child abuse and the misuse of social media platforms among students.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 13th, 2025",
