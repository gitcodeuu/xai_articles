Co-accused Amir Mahmood Kayani appeared in court, while Faisal Javed Khan and Wasiq Qayyum submitted applications requesting exemption from attendance. Several of the co-accused had already been indicted in earlier proceedings.\n\nThe case registered at I-9 police station also named PTI leaders Faisal Javed Khan, Wasiq Qayyum, and Amir Kayani.\n\nThe court summoned prosecution witnesses and adjourned the hearing until May 19.\n\nIn a related matter, hearings in other protest-related cases registered at CTD and Golra Police Stations have been dela­­yed due to the unavailability of Mr Khan.\n\nJudge Sipra emphasised that Mr Khan holds the same legal status in these cases as in others and noted that proceedings could not continue without his appearance.\n\nThe proceedings in those cases have been adjourned until May 16.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 13th, 2025",
