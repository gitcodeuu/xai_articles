He stated that Pakistan was looking forward to establishing a path for long-term peace and security that would provide “dignity for both sides”.\n\nHe further said that long-term negotiations between the two neighbours were “not done yet”.\n\nThere was no direct contact between Indian or Pakistani officials, Dar clarified to CNN. Instead, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio passed on the message to Pakistan that India was ready to stop the fighting, he said.",
