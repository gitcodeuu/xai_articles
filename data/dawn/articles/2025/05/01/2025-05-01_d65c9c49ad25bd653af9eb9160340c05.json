He said energy sector reforms is another important agenda of the government that focuses on improvement in all the phases from generation to transmission and distribution of electricity and those measures resulted in reduction of power tariff. He hinted some more good news in coming months.\n\nHigher costs of financing, energy and taxation were major challenges for business and industry in Pakistan, he said, but added that now policy rate reductions brought the financing cost lower and some respite has also been observed in power tariffs, while rationalisation of tax rates in the upcoming budget was under consideration as well.\n\nThe minister said the government had started the consultation process for budget making early this year and proposals submitted by the chambers and trade associations were being reviewed in detail. He said the government is also working on segregating the tax policy office from the FBR and bringing it under the ambit of the finance ministry. From next year, all the stakeholders’ proposals will be considered by the tax policy office, while the FBR will be responsible for tax collection, he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 1st, 2025",
