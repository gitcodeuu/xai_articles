  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pub­lic Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament on We­­dnesday voiced conc­e­­rn over audit irregularities in institutions under the Ministry of National Food Security, particular­ly the Pakistan Central Cot­ton Committee (PCCC) and the Pakistan Agri­cul­tural Research Council (PARC), focusing on unlawful appointments and financial mismanagement.\n\nChaired by MNA Junaid Akbar Khan, the PAC reprimanded Secretary for Food Security Waseem Ajmal Chaudhry for appearing unprepared before the committee. Members reviewed audit objections related to the non-recovery of Rs3.44 billion in cotton cess from textile mills by the PCCC. Despite prior notices, the amount was not recovered.\n\nMr Chaudhry assured the committee the recovery would be made within three months.\n\nPAC members, including MNA Malik Amir Dogar, criticised the deteriorating state of the cotton industry. Mr Dogar questioned the cotton sector’s revitalisation and the reforms’ effectiveness, citing the PCCC’s 15-year dysfunction.\n\nOrders full probe into PARC hiring scandal involving nepotism and unlawful appointments\n\nThe secretary said the PCCC was being merged into the PARC as part of an institutional restructuring plan.\n\nAnother audit objection revealed that 155 temporary employees were hired illegally by the PCCC. Mr Chaudhry admitted the appointments were made without approval from the Finance Division and confirmed they had all been terminated. The committee, unsatisfied, deman­ded a full inquiry report within 15 days.\n\nCommittee member Syed Hussain Tariq poin­ted to the high turnover of secretaries in the ministry, arg­uing that frequent transfers were hindering effective governance.\n\nTensions rose as the committee rejected the secretary’s responses to several audit questions, including the unlawful hiring practices at PARC. Audit officials disclosed that while PARC had advertised 164 positions, it appointed 332 individuals. Most of the hires reportedly came from only three districts, instead of the mandated 136, raising concerns of nepotism. PAC members claimed they had lists linking the appointees to top officials, including the current and former chairmen of PARC.\n\nMNA Shazia Marri called the alleged nepotism “deeply troubling”. Chairman Junaid Akbar echoed her sentiment and questioned why the acting PARC chairman had atte­nded the session instead of the permanent chairman, who was reportedly on a three-month leave.\n\nThe committee directed that the entire hiring process at PARC be redone and demanded a comprehensive performance audit. Members also called for full details on PARC’s veh­icle fleet and its utilisation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 1st, 2025",
