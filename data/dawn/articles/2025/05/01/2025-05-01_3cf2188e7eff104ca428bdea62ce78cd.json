  "content": "WASHINGTON: Secretary of State Marco Rubio has warned that the United States would give up on mediation unless Russia and Ukraine put forward “concrete proposals,” as US patience wanes on an early priority for Donald Trump.\n\nThe US president had vowed to end the war in his first 24 hours back in the White House but, as Trump celebrates 100 days in office, Rubio has suggested the administration could soon turn attention to other issues.\n\n“We are now at a time where concrete proposals need to be delivered by the two parties on how to end this conflict,” State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday, in what she said was a message from Rubio.\n\n“If there is not progress, we will step back as mediators in this process.”\n\nShe said it would ultimately be up to Trump to decide whether to move ahead on diplomacy.\n\nThe president suggested on Tuesday that his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin still wants to negotiate a peace agreement with Ukraine.\n\nAsked in an interview with ABC television if Putin wants peace, Trump said: “I think he does.”\n\nPutin recently proposed a three-day ceasefire around Moscow’s commemorations next week for the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II. But he has rebuffed a Ukrainian-backed US call for a 30-day ceasefire.\n\nThe United States wants “not a three-day moment so you can celebrate something else — a complete, durable ceasefire and an end to the conflict,” Tammy Bruce said.\n\nMeans of pressure\n\nIt remains unclear if Rubio is actually ready to turn the page or is seeking to pressure the two countries. The United States already put together a framework proposal which Ukrainians feel bows to Russian demands.\n\nTrump has suggested an official recognition of Russia’s takeover in 2014 of Crimea, an annexation rejected by nearly all the world, in addition to land swaps. “We all want this war to end in a fair way — with no rewards for Putin, especially no land,” Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told an event in Poland by videoconference on Tuesday.\n\nRussia has also not moved on the proposal with many experts believing Moscow now sees an upper hand — on the battlefield and diplomatically, with Trump eager to reconcile.\n\nRussia’s ambassador to the United Nations, Vassily Nebenzia, sought to blame Zelensky and said that Russia would keep speaking with the United States.\n\nZelensky “is bent on escalating the conflict. He’s recklessly rejecting the United States’ balanced peace proposals,” Nebenzia told a UN Security Council meeting.\n\nUS diplomat John Kelley told the session that both sides would benefit from working off the US framework and condemned Russian strikes into Ukraine.\n\n“Right now, Russia has a great opportunity to achieve a durable peace,” Kelley said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 1st, 2025",
