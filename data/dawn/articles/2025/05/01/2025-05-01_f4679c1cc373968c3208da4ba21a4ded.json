While labour laws exist in the country, enforcement is weak, and despite government promises to create millions of jobs, issues like low pay, lack of social protection, and poor representation remain unresolved.\n\nRallying outside HPC today, civil society called for education, social protection and empowerment for the labour community.\n\nPeople performed theatre and dances to celebrate the day.
