  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Dejected by an inordinate delay in the release of their salaries, the visiting faculty of the Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) is exploring options other than teaching, since their salaries have not been paid since the 2023 fall semester.\n\nIn a grave violation of its rules and regulations, the QAU has not paid salaries to its visiting employees for almost two years. There are 26 departments in QAU and in all departments, there are hundreds of visiting teachers; however, they have not been paid by the university management.\n\n“This is a violation of fundamental rights. How can anyone manage without a salary? We have families and kids, we have to purchase groceries, we have to pay house rent and pay school fee; not paying salaries since Fall 2023, and so it is a big injustice to the faculty members,” said a visiting teacher, whose salary has been pending for 18 months.\n\nAnother member said he did not receive his salary. “We are upset and planning to quit this job, but the problem is that our salaries are stuck; once we get our due salaries, then we will decide our new course of action,” he said and added that many faculty members were exploring options, such as joining any other university.\n\nRegular employees complain of problems with medical bills’ clearance\n\nAnother dejected member asked how long the teachers can focus on their teaching when they have to think about multiple other issues due to the non-payment of salaries. “This is a shameful act of the university that teachers have remained unpaid,” he said and added that ultimately, teachers would lose their interest in their jobs, which would impact the performance of students.\n\nOn the other hand, the regular faculty members and employees are also facing issues in getting their medical bills cleared by the university. “We are facing issues regarding the reimbursement of medical bills,” said an employee of the university.\n\nQAU visiting faculty members said that the university told them that it was facing a financial crisis and soon their issues would be resolved as the QAU administration had requested the federal government for a bailout package.\n\n“Getting a bailout package or supplementary fund should not be linked to our salaries; we should be paid on the pattern of the regular faculty members,” the visiting faculty member said.\n\nQAU Vice Chancellor Dr Niaz Ahmad Akhtar could not be reached for his comments. It is relevant to note here that besides the QAU, the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) and the Federal Urdu University of Science and Technology are also facing funding issues.\n\nTo address this crisis, the HEC and the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training in March this year requested the government for a supplementary grant of Rs2.5 billion. However, so far, the above-mentioned universities have not received any additional funds.\n\nMeanwhile, the Higher Education Commission sources said the sector had been facing a shortfall of Rs60 billion. The HEC faced a shortfall of Rs17.7 billion in 2018-19, which has been continuously increasing. The sources said that the higher education sector was confronted with a shortfall of Rs60.1 billion, adding that the HEC requirement was Rs125 billion while the allocation was Rs65 billion for the current fiscal year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 1st, 2025",
