They said the explosion took place early in the morning when three children from the Sulemankhel tribe were grazing goats near the checkpost.\n\nOne of the children stepped on the hidden IED, triggering the blast. As a result, a boy, identified as Masood, died on the spot. Another child, Sabir, was critically injured.\n\nPolice officials said the injured child was immediately shifted to the District Headquarters Hospital, Wana.\n\nSHO Azam Warsak police station Alamgir Mehsud said the IED was planted by unknown persons with the apparent intent to target security forces.\n\nSecurity sources said the IED was likely intended to target FC personnel or their vehicles.\n\nIt is worth noting here that just three days earlier, a deadly IED explosion rocked the bustling Rustam Bazaar in Wana, claiming at least 12 lives and injuring 18 others.\n\nResidents have urged the government and security agencies to take immediate and effective measures to restore peace in the area and ensure the safety of citizens.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 1st, 2025",
