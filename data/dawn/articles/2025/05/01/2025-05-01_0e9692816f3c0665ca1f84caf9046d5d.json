They made it clear that the Kashmiri struggle was against fascist ideology and an oppressive military, not against India’s Dalit and other minority communities who themselves faced systematic persecution under the Modi regime.\n\nThey stressed that the people of AJK would be at the forefront, alongside Pakistan’s armed forces, in the event of any aggression.\n\nMeanwhile, at one point during the session, the speaker asked the government to restrict tourist movement to Neelum Valley in view of the current war-like situation. He said the threat of Indian aggression made it necessary to prevent tourists from becoming stranded or endangered, and asked the administration to ensure the safety and wellbeing of all visitors.\n\nMeanwhile, federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam on Wednesday said that the people living along the LoC were not alone — the entire nation, the government, and Pakistan Army stood by them.\n\nAddressing a “Solidarity with Kashmir” rally in Sharda, located in the upper belt of Neelum Valley, he said Pakistan had always desired peace, but if India initiated a war, the entire nation would stand shoulder to shoulder with Pakistan Army to defeat it. “No power in the world can defeat the passion of the Pakistani nation and the commitment of its armed forces,” he declared.\n\nThe minister reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to playing an active role at every forum to secure the Kashmiri people’s fundamental right to self-determination and vowed never to backtrack on the cause of their freedom.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 1st, 2025",
