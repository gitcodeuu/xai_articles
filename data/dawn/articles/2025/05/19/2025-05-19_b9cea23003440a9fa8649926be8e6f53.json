  "content": "SWAT: The once-pristine Swat River, a vital lifeline of tourism and a source of relief for locals during the hot summer months, is under increasing threat as powerful individuals encroach upon its banks, particularly along the Bypass Road and Fizagat area.\n\nBoth the sites are popular tourist resorts for locals and tourists.\n\nResidents and tourists have raised alarm over the rapid disappearance of scenic riverfront sites, which were once accessible public spaces but are now gradually being fenced off or built upon — often by politically connected individuals.\n\n“This river is a shared natural asset, not the private property of a few influential people. We used to bring our families here in the summer to cool off, but now we are greeted by cement and walls,” said Gul Rahman, a resident of Mingora.\n\nComplain riverbanks lined with restaurants, buildings\n\nLocals say that many of these areas — long considered public picnic spots — are now off-limits or have been turned into private businesses. “Fizagat used to be the heart of local tourism, a green escape. Today, it is unrecognisable with private structures creeping in from every side,” lamented Shahida Bibi, a teacher from Saidu Sharif.\n\nTourists visiting the valley have echoed these concerns. “We came to Swat to enjoy its natural beauty, but were shocked to find the riverbanks lined with restaurants and buildings. It feels like the river is being stolen from the people,” said Hamza Qureshi, a visitor from Lahore.\n\nEnvironmental experts have warned that the ongoing construction and illegal occupation of riverbank land not only violates environmental laws but also contributes to rising temperatures in the region by replacing greenery with concrete.\n\n“Swat is headed for an environmental crisis. River encroachment disrupts water flow, destroys aquatic ecosystems, and increases urban heat. If this trend continues, Swat will lose the very nature that makes it unique,” said Dr Rab Nawaz, an environmentalist based in Mingora.\n\nDespite the growing outcry, the district administration appears to have turned a blind eye. Many locals allege that administrative inaction stems from the political clout of those involved in the encroachments.\n\n“The silence of the authorities is deafening. Ordinary people are not allowed to build even a wall near the river, yet these influential individuals are constructing entire complexes without resistance,” said Amir Zeb, a civil society activist.\n\nIn response, residents and tourists have appealed to both the provincial and federal governments to take urgent and decisive action against what they describe as a growing land mafia. They are demanding the removal of illegal structures and restoration of public access to riverfront areas.\n\n“Let the Swat River flow free and remain a source of joy for all — not just a profit-making avenue for the powerful,” read a petition, which was recently launched by local youth, garnering thousands of signatures in just a few days.\n\nThe unchecked encroachment of Swat’s riverbanks is not merely a local issue — it is a warning sign of a broader environmental and governance crisis. Without swift intervention, the valley known for its rivers, forests, and cool air may become a casualty of unchecked greed and official neglect.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",
