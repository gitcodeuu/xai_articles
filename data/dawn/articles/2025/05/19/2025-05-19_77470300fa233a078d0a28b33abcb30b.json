The next campaign is set to begin May 26 and aims to vaccinate more than 45.4 million children under the age of five.\n\nDr Elias commended the government’s efforts and reaffirmed the Gates Foundation’s commitment to a polio-free Pakistan.\n\n“We are encouraged by Pakistan’s progress and hopeful that the goal of eradication in 2025 will be achieved,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",
