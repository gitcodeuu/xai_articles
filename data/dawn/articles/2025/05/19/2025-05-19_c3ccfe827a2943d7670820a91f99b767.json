After drone interceptions and airbase strikes, US intervention on May 10 led to a ceasefire. India has maintained its aggressive stance, while Pakistan has warned against further escalation and offered dialogue.\n\n“Today, Deputy Prime Minister/Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar arrived in Beijing on a three-day official visit from 19-21 May 2025. He was received at the airport by senior Chinese officials and the Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Khalil Hashmi,” the Foreign Office announced in a post on X.\n\nDuring the visit, Dar is set to hold in-depth discussions with his Chinese counterpart on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.\n\nThe two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.\n\nThe visit forms part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China. It also underscores the two countries’ shared commitment to further strengthen the All-Weather Strategic Cooperative Partnership, the report added.\n\nAfghanistan’s interim Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi is also expected to be in Beijing and participate in the talks to disc­uss regional peace and security.\n\nPrior to his departure, Dar told the media that China was a major trading partner of Pakistan and that both countries enjoyed an iron-clad close relationship, Associated Press of Pakistan reports.\n\nThe foreign minister said that during the last three weeks, he had two telephonic interactions with FM Wang Yi, who invited him to visit China.\n\nDar said that his meetings with the Chinese leadership would mark discussions on political, local, regional and global issues, besides the recent tensions between Pakistan and India.\n\nReferring to his telephonic interactions with his counterparts worldwide, Dar said that they have exposed the Indian blame game against Pakistan, including the attack on any nuclear installation.\n\nThe Foreign Office earlier said Dar will undertake an official visit to Beijing to hold in-depth discussions with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability.\n\n“The pair will discuss the evolving regional situation in South Asia and its implications for peace and stability,” the FO said. “The two sides will also review the entire spectrum of Pakistan-China bilateral relations and exchange views on regional and global developments of mutual interest.”\n\nIt added that the visit was part of the ongoing high-level exchanges between Pakistan and China.\n\nChina had also reaffirmed its support for Pakistan amid escalation with India in a meeting with President Asif Ali Zardari on May 5.\n\nPakistan has held strong bilateral relations with China which has supported it through many investments and development projects such as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which was termed as a “lifeline” for the country’s economy.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning said Dar’s visit reflected the importance Pakistan attached to developing bilateral relations.\n\n“China and Pakistan are all-weather strategic cooperative partners. The two countries maintain close, high-level exchange and cooperation,” she said during her regular briefing while commenting on Dar’s visit.\n\nThe spokesperson said that China stood ready to work with Pakistan to further deliver on the importance of understandings between leaders, enhance strategic communication and deepen exchange and cooperation to advance bilateral relations and accelerate the building of a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.\n\nOn the India-Pakistan situation, she said that China had stated its position multiple times and added, “We will continue to maintain communication with both sides and play a constructive role for a comprehensive, lasting ceasefire between the two countries and maintaining regional peace and stability.”\n\nIn response to a question, Mao Ning said, “I want to tell you that India and Pakistan are both China’s important neighbours. China attaches, all along, great importance to China-India and China-Pakistan relations.”\n\nThe Chinese side was committed to the philosophy and principle of good neighbourliness with neighbouring countries, she said.\n\n“We welcome and support the realised ceasefire between the two countries and are ready to play a constructive role in realising a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire between the two countries and maintaining regional peace and stability,” she added.",
