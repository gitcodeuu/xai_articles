  "content": "A Dhaka court has once again directed officers-in-charge of 12 police stations to submit — by June 25 — the progress reports on execution of arrest warrants against 18 people, including former prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her daughter Saima Wazed Putul, in a case over alleged irregularities in plot allocation in Purbachal New Town.\n\nJudge Md Zakir Hossain of the Dhaka Metropolitan Senior Special Judge’s Court passed the order as police failed to submit any progress reports before the court today.\n\nOn April 10, the same court issued arrest warrants against Hasina and others after taking cognisance of the charges. On that day, the court had directed the officers of over a dozen police stations in Dhaka and other parts of the country to submit progress reports on the execution of the arrest warrants by May 4. But police failed to submit any progress report by that date. Later, the court fixed today for submission of the progress report.\n\nOn March 25, Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) Assistant Director Afnan Jannat Keya, also the investigation officer of the case, submitted the charge sheet against the 18 accused, showing them as fugitives. She appealed to the court to issue arrest warrants against them as they had not been granted bail by any court.\n\nThe case against Hasina, Putul, and 16 others was filed with the ACC’s Dhaka Integrated District Office on January 12. According to the case statement, Putul, the prime accused, concealed information about her and her family’s ownership of housing or apartments within the jurisdiction of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (Rajuk).\n\nThe 16 other accused in the case are Saiful Islam Sarkar, administrative officer; Purabi Goldar, senior assistant secretary; Kazi Wasi Uddin, additional secretary (administration); Shahid Ullah Khandaker, secretary of the housing and public works ministry; and Rajuk officials Anisur Rahman Mia, former chairman; Md Khurshid Alam, member (estate and land); Kabir Al Asad, member (administration and finance); Tanmoy Das, member (development and control); Md Nasir Uddin, former member (planning); Major (retd) Shamsuddin Ahmed Chowdhury, former member (development); Md Hafizur Rahman, deputy director (estate and land-3); Md Habibur Rahman, deputy director (estate and land-3); Sheikh Shahinul Islam, director (estate and land-2); Md Nurul Islam, member (estate and land); Mohammad Salahuddin, former personal secretary to the ousted prime minister; and Sharif Ahmed, former state minister for housing and public works.\n\nAccording to ACC documents, Hasina, in collusion with senior Rajuk officials, had six plots allotted to herself; her son Sajeeb Wazed Joy; daughter Putul; younger sister Sheikh Rehana; Rehana’s son Radwan Mujib Siddiq Bobby; and Rehana’s daughter Azmina Siddiq — in violation of rules.\n\nThe ACC filed total six cases over alleged irregularities in the allocation of the six plots, each measuring 10 kathas, in the diplomatic zone of Sector-27 in the Purbachal New Town project.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",
