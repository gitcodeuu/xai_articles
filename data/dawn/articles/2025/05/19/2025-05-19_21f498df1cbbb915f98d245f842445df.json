Their mother was in critical condition,” he added.\n\nHe said that the family were shifted to the Qazi Hussain Ahmad Medical Complex, where the siblings — 8-year-old Maryam, 6-year-old Hareem and 4-year-old Muhammad Yaman — were pronounced dead.\n\n“The mother is undergoing treatment at the hospital,” Shah continued.\n\nThe police lodged an inquiry report on the complaint of Bakht Sher, the children’s father, the spokesperson said, adding that an investigation was underway to ascertain the cause of the deaths.\n\nIn April, three children lost their lives while five others were in critical condition after having “poisonous” sweets in Punjab’s Hafizabad district.\n\nLast year, a chemical report revealed that the deaths of 13 family members in Khairpur were allegedly caused by consuming poisonous milk.",
