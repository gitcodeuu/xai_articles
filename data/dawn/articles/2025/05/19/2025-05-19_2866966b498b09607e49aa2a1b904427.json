Extreme radicalism in India has thus made the lives of all minorities, including Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians, highly miserable. Atrocities in occupied Kashmir, fatal trans-frontier attacks on Sikh leaders demanding an independent Khalistan, mistreating Dalits and Tamils, destruction of churches in Manipur and interference in the internal affairs of Bangladesh have totally isolated India in South Asia.\n\nHe said the recent conflict with Pakistan, which had the potential to escalate beyond control, was initiated by India after a false-flag operation. He pointed out that India had triggered largest escalation without any forensic investigation into the Pahalgam shooting.\n\n“They underestimated their adversary and thus suffered strategic humility, which altered the regional equation. False propaganda by their immature media not only mislead their armed forces but also their public and naive short-sighted political leadership,” Gen Qayyum remarked.\n\n“With BJP’s Hindutva philosophy and RSS-dominated radical government in power, peace seems to be a far cry at present,” he noted.\n\nThe PML-N leader called for a halt to atrocities in India-held Kashmir and restoration of special status of the territory.\n\nHe called upon India to allow military observers of the United Nations present on both sides of the Line of Control to operate and investigate independently all alleged violations of ceasefire.\n\nHe said that against an Indo-Israel axis of repression, Pakistan and China have emerged as an axis of deterrence. Pakistan’s conventional deterrence has been legitimised. The Indian doctrine of swift punitive strikes has failed.\n\nHe said the BJP government’s policies were very destructive for not only the regional peace but also for India itself. Modi’s government can only thwart disintegration of India by stopping repressive policies and use of brutal force against internal movements like Assam, Kashmir, Khalistan, Mizoram, Nagaland, Tamil Nadu, Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur, he said.\n\nHe recalled that then Indian minister of external affairs Jaswant Singh, who served BJP for 30 long years was ousted just because he had praised Mohammad Ali Jinnah.\n\nMr Qayyum said Pakistan wants to abide by the ceasefire agreement in a letter and spirit and directed its military command not to be provoked.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 19th, 2025",
