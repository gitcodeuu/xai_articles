  "content": "WASHINGTON: Meta has banned a prominent Muslim news page on Instagram in India at the government’s req­uest, the account’s founder said, denouncing the move as “cen­sorship” as hostilities escalate between India and Pakistan.\n\nInstagram users in India trying to access posts from the handle @Muslim — a page with 6.7 million followers — were met with a message stating: “Account not available in India. This is because we complied with a legal request to restrict this content.” There was no immediate reaction from the Indian government on the ban, which comes after access was blocked to the social media accounts of Pakistani actors and cricketers. “I received hundreds of messages, emails and comments from our followers in India, that they cannot access our account,” Ameer Al-Khataht­beh, the news account’s founder and editor-in-chief, said in a statement.\n\n“Meta has blocked the @Muslim account by legal request of the Indian government. This is censorship.” Meta declined to comment. A spokesman for the tech giant said a company webpage outlining its policy for restricting content when governments believe material on its platforms goes “against local law.” The development, first reported by the US tech journalist Taylor Lorenz’ outlet User Magazine, comes in the wake of the worst violence between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan in two decades.\n\nThe @Muslim account is among the most followed Muslim news sources on Instagram. Khatahtbeh apologised to followers in India, adding: “When platforms and countries try to silence media, it tells us that we are doing our job in holding those in power accountable.” “We will continue to document the truth and stand out firmly for justice,” he added, while calling on Meta to reinstate the account in India.\n\nIndia has also banned more than a dozen Pakistani YouTube channels for allegedly spreading “provocative” content, including Pakistani news outlets. In recent days, access to the Instagram account of Pakistan’s former prime minister and cricket captain Imran Khan has also been blocked in India.\n\nPakistani Bollywood movie regulars Fawad Khan and Atif Aslam were also off limits in India, as well as a wide range of cricketers — including star batters Babar Azam and Mohammad Rizwan and retired players Shahid Afridi and Wasim Akram.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 9th, 2025",
