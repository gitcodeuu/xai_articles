It is a network that dwarfs its regional rivals, including India, and is second only to the US.\n\n“Both in terms of space and missile tracking capabilities, China is much better off now in terms of being able to monitor things as they happen,” said Neill, who is an adjunct fellow at Hawaii’s Pacific Forum think-tank.\n\nChina’s defence ministry did not immediately respond to Reuters’ questions about the deployment of its military satellites and other questions about its intelligence gathering.\n\nPakistan’s military media wing and information minister did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any information sharing with China. Pakistan has previously said it has an “all-weather strategic, cooperative partnership” with China.\n\nIndia has not commented on the issue, but its top diplomat in Britain, High Commissioner Vikram Doraiswami, told Sky News on Thursday that China’s relationship with Pakistan was not a concern for India.\n\n“China requires a relationship with all of its neighbours, that includes us,” he said.\n\nChinese military intelligence teams would be eager to garner information on any Indian use of air defences and launches of cruise and ballistic missiles - not just in terms of flight paths and accuracy but also command and control information, analysts and diplomats say.\n\nAny deployment of India’s BrahMos supersonic cruise missile — a weapon it developed jointly with Russia — would be of particular interest, some analysts say, given they do not believe it has been used in combat.\n\nChina has also beefed up its intelligence gathering at sea. It has been increasingly active in the Indian Ocean in recent years, with China deploying space tracking ships as well as oceanographic research and fishing vessels on extended deployments, open-source intelligence trackers say.\n\nRegional diplomats say that while the Chinese navy has been relatively cautious about extensive warship deployments into the Indian Ocean, still lacking a broad network of bases, it actively seeks intelligence with these other vessels.\n\nOver the last week, some trackers noted unusually large fleets of Chinese fishing vessels moving apparently in unison to within 120 nautical miles of Indian naval drills in the Arabian Sea as tensions rose with Pakistan.\n\nPentagon reports on China’s military modernisation and analysts note that China’s fishing fleets routinely perform a coordinated militia function that plays an important intelligence-gathering role.\n\n“These vessels may double up as listening posts, tracking development rhythms and response patterns, feeding early warning, naval intel to their sponsors,” wrote open source tracker Damien Symon in an X post that highlighted the deployment of 224 Chinese vessels near Indian naval exercises on May 1.\n\nChinese officials do not usually acknowledge the existence of fishing militia or intelligence work carried out by other nominally civilian vessels.\n\nGiven its deep and broad strategic relationship with Pakistan, Beijing can also be expected to fully exploit its network of envoys and military teams there for key nuggets.\n\n“The presence of Chinese military advisers and other personnel in Pakistan is well-known given how Pakistan’s Ministry of Defence has been importing some of its most advanced military hardware from China, so we can be certain the PLA would be able to access relevant data,” said James Char, a Chinese security scholar at Singapore’s S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies.",
