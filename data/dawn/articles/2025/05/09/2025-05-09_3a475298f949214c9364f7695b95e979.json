It urged the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), global powers, and international human rights bodies to take immediate notice and initiate effective action.\n\nResolutions decry unprovoked attacks on civilians, mosques\n\nThe assembly also decried the purported targeting of the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project at Nauseri, calling it “water aggression” and a violation of international law, which prohibits attacks on water infrastructure even during wartime.\n\nBalochistan Assembly\n\nThe Balochistan Assembly, with Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai presiding, unanimously adopted a similar resolution.\n\nBalochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, who moved the resolution on Wednesday, said, “This aggression exposed India’s dangerous intentions and malicious actions to the world.”\n\nMr said the house strongly condemns India’s “blatant violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty, territorial integrity, and airspace”.\n\nHe said, “Under the cover of darkness last night, India carried out cowardly and unprovoked attacks on various locations in the country — including mosques in Muridke, Ahmedpur East, Muzaffarabad, and Kotli, and a dispensary near Shakargarh. As a result, several innocent, unarmed Pakistani civilians were martyred and injured.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 9th, 2025",
