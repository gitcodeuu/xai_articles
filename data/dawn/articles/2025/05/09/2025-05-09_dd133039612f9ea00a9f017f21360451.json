When you don’t have any evidence, what do you do? You open up the military front.”\n\nHe went on to say that India was shifting the blame for the attack on Pakistan to divert attention from its internal problems.\n\nThe military spokesperson called out India for launching attacks on Pakistan and targeting civilians, including women and children.",
