  "content": "KARACHI/LAHORE: Amnesty International and The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) on Thursday urged India and Pakistan to de-escalate rapidly escalating hostilities and prioritise the protection of civilians, following reports of numerous casualties on both sides of the border.\n\nAmnesty International voiced grave concern over the civilian toll. “The escalation of hostilities between India and Pakistan has already taken a toll on civilians. Amnesty International is concerned by reports of loss of civilian lives in both India and Pakistan,” Carolyn Horn, Programme Director for Law and Policy at Amnesty International, said in a statement\n\n“In every armed conflict, protecting civilians is paramount, it’s a fundamental principle of international humanitarian law which binds all nations,” Horn continued.\n\n“Deliberate, indiscriminate or disproportionate attacks harming civilians or damaging civilian infrastructure such as homes, hospitals, schools, and essential services, are strictly prohibited under the Geneva Conventions and their additional protocols and under customary international law.”\n\nAmnesty, HRCP stress international law strictly prohibits deliberate attacks on civilians, warn of dangers from nuclear conflict\n\nThe organisation said they “must take all necessary measures to protect civilians and minimise any suffering and casualties in both countries.”\n\nThe rights group also extended condolences to families affected by the conflict and unequivocally condemned “the deliberate targeting and unlawful killing of civilians by armed groups during the horrific attack in Pahalgam, Indian-held Kashmir, on April 22.”\n\nIt called for an “independent, transparent and thorough investigation to bring the suspected perpetrators of the atrocity to account through fair trials, without recourse to the death penalty.”\n\nHRCP statement\n\nEchoing the urgent need for restraint, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan’s governing council, concluding its biannual meeting on Thursday in Lahore, appealed to both governments to de-escalate.\n\nThe commission said its belief that “the reported casualties including those of women and children, due to Indian air strikes, are a grave violation of international human rights law and may constitute crimes against humanity.”\n\nThe Lahore-based rights body urged “all actors to commit to dialogue and peaceful coexistence,” unequivocally condemning “all forms of violent extremism and the weaponisation of religion on both sides of the border.”\n\nIt warned that armed conflict between the nuclear-armed neighbours “threatens not only regional stability but also endangers the fundamental rights of more than a billion people,” and fosters a climate enabling states “to suppress criticism and intensify securitisation, thereby weakening democratic norms and accountability.”\n\nThe agency also cautioned the public against “toxic media narratives,” stressing that “truth becomes the first casualty” in such times and calling on media to maintain integrity.\n\nDomestically, the commission highlighted concerns including impunity regarding enforced disappearances, attacks on the Ahmadiyya community, and misuse of blasphemy laws, urging reforms and accountability. The current escalation began after India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir early on Wednesday.\n\nPakistani officials reported 31 deaths and 57 injuries, including women and children, from these strikes, claiming three civilians were also killed in a drone attack on May 8.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 9th, 2025",
