  "content": "US Vice President JD Vance has said that Washington wants to see a “de-escalation” in a worsening conflict between India and Pakistan, but that it is “fundamentally none of our business”, AFP reports.\n\n“What we can do is try to encourage these folks to de-escalate a little bit, but we’re not going to get involved in the middle of a war that’s fundamentally none of our business and has nothing to do with America’s ability to control it,” said Vance, who has been a proponent of US disengagement from international conflicts, in an interview with Fox News.",
