Officials said two drones crashed in Walton, while another crashed in Burki soon after security forces intercepted them. According to a witness, they heard multiple explosions in the old Walton airport area, leading to widespread confusion among locals.\n\nIn Rawalpindi, one person — a resident of Lahore — lost his life and two were inj­ured after a drone crashed near the Pindi Cricket Stadium on the Murree Road.\n\nA police officer said that the stadium’s food street was not fully open and there were not many people around ; otherwise, there could have been more casualties.\n\nAnother drone damaged a house after it crashed on its rooftop in the Westridge locality of the garrison city. However, no casualties were reported.\n\nIn Attock, a farmer was killed near Jabbi Kasran — a town in Fateh Jang tehsil — after an Indian drone was downed. The injured person was taken to hospital, but could not survive.\n\nIn Gujranwala, three drones were destroyed in different locations of the district. The locals found wreckage of the drones in the Tokrian village of Wahndo and Solakhanabad village on the outskirts of the city. Another drone was found in a field near Aimanabad’s Agu Bhandar village of Gujranwala.\n\nIn Gujrat, parts of an Indian drone were found in Peer Jhand village in the jurisdiction of the Dinga police station. According to eyewitnesses, some parts of the drone fell in the field while some crashed on a house, falling through its roof into a room on the ground floor. However, everyone remained safe.\n\nIn Bahawalpur, an Ind­ian drone was destroyed in the Cholistan desert. According to the announcement, the Indian drone hit the area of Chapoowala in the desert in the limits of tehsil Yazman.\n\nIn Karachi, two drones fell on the outskirts of the Malir district, partially damaging the roof of a house. The first drone fell on a house in the Sharafi Goth slum, said area police SHO Sadaruddin Mirani. It damaged the roof partially, but no one was hurt. He said the incident occu­rred at around 10:30am.\n\nThe officer said that the drone was two and a half feet long.\n\nSoon after, another dr­­o­ne fell near the residential neighbourhood of Gulshan-i-Hadeed.\n\nMalir SP Mansoor Gulzar Bozdar told Dawn the drone fell in a hilly area near Link Road. He said it did not cause any damage to life or property.\n\nIn Umerkot, an Indian drone also crashed near the village of Sufi Akbar, close to the Chhor cantonment. Fortunately, no casualties or injuries were reported.\n\n‘Serious, serious provocation’\n\nIndia also admitted that it targetted military installations.\n\nA statement by India’s Press Information Bureau said army installations were targeted “at a number of locations across Pakistan”. However, the attacks mostly took place in areas heavily populated by civilians.\n\nAs he shared details about the operation that downed drones, Lt-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry said that the Pakistan Army used “their soft-kill (technical) and hard-kill (weapons) skills fully” to shoot down 25 Israeli-made Harop drones.\n\nReferring to Pakistan’s response to Indian strikes, the ISPR press release said, “After the destruction of its five modern jets, drones and several posts, as well as soldier deaths, India is attacking Pakistan using these Israeli-made Harop drones in panic.”\n\n“This cowardly attack is a sign of India’s worry and panic,” it added.\n\n“The debris of these Israeli-made Harop drones is being collected from various locations across Pakistan,” the military’s media wing said. It asserted that the Pakistan Army was “giving a befitting reply to the enemy and crushing all its nefarious designs”.\n\nDuring the press briefing, the military’s media spokesman also showed a series of pictures showing the debris of the drones. He added that the debris and downed drones were being collected from multiple locations.\n\n“As we speak, the process of India sending across these Harop drones, this naked aggression continues, and the armed forces are on high degree of alert and neutralising them as we speak,” Lt-Gen Chaudhry continued.\n\n“This is a serious, serious provocation,” the ISPR chief added.\n\nAccording to BBC News, Lt-Gen Chaudhry said the Indian government needs to transition from “cinema” into the “real world we live in” and called the strikes a “phantom defence”.\n\nAsif Chaudhry in Lahore, Waseem Ashraf Butt in Gujrat, Majeed Gill in Bahawalpur and Mohammad Asghar in Rawalpindi also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 9th, 2025",
