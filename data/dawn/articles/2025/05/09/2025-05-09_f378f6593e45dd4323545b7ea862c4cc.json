In such a situation, the residents should stay away from windows as windowpanes may shatter and cause injuries.\n\nThe home department suggests that people should turn off power and gas to avoid incidents of fire in case of any untoward incident. If one can’t reach a building, a person needs to lie on the ground, the advisory adds.\n\nIt instructs that people should put off lights in areas under attack, and before returning to their routine should ensure that danger had subsided even after sirens go silent. In case of an injury, one should immediately go for first aid and approach the rescue teams, it advises.\n\nAs a precaution, the home department has asked people to keep ready an “emergency bag” having water, dry food, medicines, torch, batteries, radio and first aid medicines. It says people should keep their family members, including elderly and children home and avoid unnecessary travel, particularly in the areas under attack.\n\nMeanwhile, in an emergency meeting with divisional commissioners and regional police officers, home department Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal ordered calling of all Divisional Intelligence Committee’s meetings and implementation of drone protocols in letter and spirit.\n\nHe also ordered the use of sirens, public training exercises by civil defence department and following the SOPs in case of emergency.\n\nThe home secretary stressed that vital installations and sensitive areas should be especially protected against any attack.\n\nPulseGuard Network\n\nThe Punjab social welfare and Baitul Maal department has established a PulseGuard Network comprising its 2,672 officials as a proactive measure to ensure a ready pool of voluntary blood donors among its employees.\n\nSocial Welfare Department Secretary Javed Akhtar Mahmood told Dawn that the current emergency situation has prompted the establishment of the network as there is an urgent need for blood bags during wars, disasters and national emergencies.\n\nMr Mahmood said the primary objective of the initiative is to maintain a real-time inventory of employee donors with their blood groups and ensure a coordinated and rapid response in critical situations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 9th, 2025",
