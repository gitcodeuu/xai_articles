  "content": "Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry called out India for “gagging the international media” and churning out propaganda “hour after hour, which is actually amusing” for Pakistan.\n\nIn an interview with TRT World, he said: “What is happening is India has gagged the international media, it has gagged the digital space and its own media is churning out these stories hour after hour which is actually amusing for us in Pakistan.\n\n“As I have said yesterday as well, in today’s 21st-century warfare, everything has an electronic signature. So, if there have been attacks from the Pakistan side, there has to be an electronic signature,” the military spokesperson added.\n\nHe continued that if the Indian media is claiming that they have downed a Pakistani aircraft, there has to be wreckage. “They are claiming they have captured our pilots, so there have to be people,” he said.",
