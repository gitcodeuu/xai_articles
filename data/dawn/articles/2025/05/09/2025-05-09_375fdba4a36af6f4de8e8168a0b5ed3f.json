He reiterated his calls for Pakistan to take concrete steps to end any support for terrorist groups,” Ms Bruce said.\n\nSeparately, the Prime Minister’s Office also issued a statement regarding the phone call, saying the premier received a telephone call from US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Thursday evening.\n\nThe US secretary telephoned the PM on the day when US President Donald Trump urged both countries to restrain after what he called a ‘tit-for-tat’ response by Pakistan, it said.\n\nIt added that the premier conveyed Pakistan’s strong condemnation of India’s missile and drone strikes that had led to the death of 31 civilians, injured 57 others and damaged civilian infrastructures.\n\nIndia’s attacks had violated Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, while gravely jeopardising peace and stability in the South Asia region, the PM added. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm resolve to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity at all costs.\n\nHe noted that the people of Pakistan were outraged by India’s unprovoked acts of war, and stressed that Pakistan reserved the right to act in self-defence, in accordance with Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz appreciated President Trump’s concern over the current security situation in South Asia. Secretary Rubio noted that the US was closely following the situation in South Asia as it was committed to promoting peace and stability in the region. To this end, he emphasised the need for Pakistan and India to work closely to de-escalate the situation.\n\nAccording to the Indian media, the US secretary made similar remarks in his call with Indian foreign minister S. Jaishankar, asking for immediate de-escalation. Secretary Rubio expressed US support for direct dialogue between India and Pakistan and encouraged continued efforts to improve communications. The secretary reiterated his condolences for the horrific terrorist attack in Pahalgam and reaffirmed the United States’ commitment to work with India in the fight against terrorism.\n\nSecurity meeting\n\nA day after the National Security Committee (NSC) meeting, PM Shehbaz endorsed its decisions during a high-level meeting on Thursday.\n\nA source in the PMO told Dawn that the meeting was attended by Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir, PML-N President Nawaz Sharif, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, and senior members of the federal cabinet. The meeting discussed the latest situation emanating from the Indian aggression and was informed that India had launched drone attacks against Pakistan on Thursday.\n\nDuring the meeting, it was reiterated that India was trying its best to start a war between the two nuclear states without assessing that it could affect the entire world.\n\nThe meeting also expressed concern over fake news being spread by India and stressed the need to keep the international media and the world updated about the factual situation and India’s designs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 9th, 2025",
