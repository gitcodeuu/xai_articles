From today, let’s replace the slogan ‘Jiay Baloch’ with ‘Jiay Balochistan’ to promote inclusivity.”\n\nHe called upon all political parties to unite in rebuilding the trust of young people and steering them away from hopelessness. “The youth are the true stakeholders of Balochistan’s resources. They need unity, not weapons, to assert their rights through democratic and peaceful means,” he said.\n\nThe provincial president of the National Party, Aslam Baloch, reiterated that the party’s elders had never advocated for armed resistance. “We believe in peaceful, democratic struggle. Force cannot solve Balochistan’s problems,” he said. He also criticised the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill in the Balochistan Assembly aimed at granting police powers to security forces.\n\nMPA Mir Rehmat Saleh Baloch highlighted the deteriorating political space in the province, saying, “Today, political parties and their workers are not tolerated. Buying and selling of posts has become the standard of representation.”\n\nDr Ishaq Baloch claimed the federal government owed Balochistan Rs700 billion in gas royalties and refuted the idea that the province was being run on Punjab or Sindh taxes. “Balochistan is rich in natural resources. The claim that it survives on others’ money is deeply insulting,” he said.\n\nOther speakers, including MPA Kulsoom Baloch and Shahwez Bizenjo, criticised Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti’s recent remarks, asserting that Pakistan benefits from Balochistan’s gas and minerals.\n\n“Form-47 assemblies are powerless. The political distance from Islamabad has lasted 78 years. It’s time to bridge that gap,” they concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 26th, 2025",
