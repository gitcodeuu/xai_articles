  "content": "PARIS: Holders Paris St-Germain crui­sed to a 3-0 victory over Stade de Reims in the Coupe de France final on Saturday, claiming a third domestic trophy for the second successive season, and preparing for next week’s Champions League final in style.\n\nPSG have now won the French Cup a record 16 times, including eight times in the last decade. The next most successful club in the history of the competition are Olympique de Marseille, who won the last of their 10 titles in 1989.\n\nLuis Enrique’s Ligue 1 champions and French Super Cup winners had little trouble seeing off relegation-battling Reims, with all the goals in the opening half at the Stade de France as PSG strolled to a record-extending 16th French Cup win.\n\nPSG went on the attack from the off, and while Reims managed the first shot on target — Amadou Kone’s long-range effort never troubling goalkeeper Matvey Safonov — they offered little opposition over the 90 minutes.\n\nIn the final, watched over by 77,000 at the national stadium, Russian Safonov was chosen ahead of Gianluigi Donnarumma but otherwise Enrique selected his strongest side.\n\nOne minor issue to come out of the evening was the late withdrawal from the team of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.\n\nThe Georgian winger was replaced in the starting line-up by Desire Doue and returned home early.\n\n“There is no problem. After the warm-up he wasn’t feeling great and we decided not to take any risks. He will be fine to train on Tuesday,” insisted Enrique.\n\nPSG dominated with slick passing, constantly pressing forward with intent, and Reims’ resolve was broken with two goals in quick succession from Bradley Barcola, which were both set up by Doue.\n\nDoue’s pass sent Barcola free in the 16th minute and he raced past his marker before whipping a shot from the edge of the area into the bottom corner.\n\nThree minutes later Marquinhos played a defence-splitting pass into the area to the feet of Doue, whose across the goal was tap­p­ed in by the perfectly positioned Barcola.\n\n“We got off to a good start and got the job done quickly. We set a lot of pace, both defensively and offensively, and it paid off,” Barcola told France 2.\n\nEven with their two-goal advantage, PSG did not take their foot off the gas, Yehvann Diouf’s fine save denying Ousmane Dembele, who pulled a shot wide of the far post from a great position, but a third goal was always coming.\n\nIt duly arrived two minutes from the break, with Barcola turning provider by playing the perfect ball across the box which Achraf Hakimi finished off at the back post.\n\nPSG maintained the intensity after the interval, Diouf having to be quick off his line to deny Joao Neves a close-range chance and the keeper then made a reflex save to keep out Barcola’s shot.\n\nThe second half was little more than a training session for PSG, with Reims again pinned back in their own half, and while they failed to add to their goal tally, Luis Enrique’s players will be full of belief for the challenge ahead.\n\nPSG will aim to lift their first Champions League trophy when they take on Inter Milan in Munich on Saturday to cap off what would be the capital club’s greatest season.\n\n“Now we have three of the four titles we could have won, and on the 31st, I hope after the game, we will all be celebrating going down in the history of the club,” added Enrique.\n\nTwo-time winner Reims were appearing in their first French Cup final since 1977 with their last success coming in the 1950s.\n\nReims must now attempt to secure Ligue 1 survival with the second leg of their relegation playoff at home to Metz on Thursday. The sides are level at 1-1 after the first leg.\n\nHaving already won Ligue 1, PSG’s victory means the Europa League place on offer to the Cup winners now goes to Olympique Lyonnais, who finished sixth in the league, while seventh-placed Strasbourg enter the Conference League.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 26th, 2025",
