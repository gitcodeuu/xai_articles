From January to November, a total of 346 people fell victim to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.\n\nLast month, a woman and her 16-month-old daughter were allegedly gunned down by her relative for ‘honour’ in KP’s Mansehra. In an FIR, the victim’s mother-in-law said that the motive behind the double murder was that her son had married the woman.",
