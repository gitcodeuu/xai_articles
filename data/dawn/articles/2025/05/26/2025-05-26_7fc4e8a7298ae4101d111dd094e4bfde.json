Langkawi was also named one of “Asia’s best coastal destinations”.\n\nThe only other place in Malaysia crowned best coastal destination is Semporna, a scenic seaside town in Sabah’s east coast.\n\nMeanwhile, the state’s capital city Kota Kinabalu joins Semporna, Langkawi, Melaka and Kuala Lumpur in the “best destinations” category.\n\nUnderstandably, Kuala Lumpur draws many visits from local and foreign tourists alike. Many of its attractions and restaurants are highlighted in the rankings.\n\nSome of the categories that the city appears in are “best family-friendly destinations” (the only Malaysian spot in this category), “best nightlife (bars)”, “best gourmet hotels”, and “best things to do”. The latter includes Petronas Twin Towers, which was also recognised under “Asia’s best night attractions”.\n\n“It’s truly exciting to see Malaysian establishments being recognised across so many categories in this year’s Trip.Best Global Rankings,” Stephane Thong, general manager of Trip.com Malaysia, said in a press statement.\n\n“From family-friendly hotels and scenic resorts to local culinary gems and iconic attractions, this recognition reflects the richness and diversity of our travel offerings.\n\n“We hope this not only inspires Malaysians to rediscover local favourites but also encourages more international travellers to explore what Malaysia has to offer – especially as we gear up for Visit Malaysia 2026,” Thong added.\n\nUpdated annually, Trip.Best is a signature collection of curated travel rankings by the international one-stop travel service provider Trip.com.\n\nThe rankings are based on an AI-driven analysis that combines expert insights with user data, which includes verified user ratings, reviews and booking trends.\n\nAside from Asia, the rankings also focus on other parts of the world. Global highlights include luxury and experiential stays (Paris, Tokyo and New York lead the “global 100 luxury hotels” list) and dining as part of the journey. Paris, New York, Singapore and Bangkok top the fine dining lists.\n\nSeasonal experiences, such as autumn foliage viewing and water-themed fun are now featured in the new categories Fall Views and Water Fun, due to travellers’ growing interest in them.\n\nFamily travel continues to thrive, with world-class resorts like Atlantis Sanya in China and Tokyo Disneyland in Japan being named among the best “global family-friendly destinations”.\n\nTheme parks like Walt Disney World (US), Universal Studios Japan and Shanghai Disney Resort remain popular on the “global best things to do” list.\n\nAnother highlight is the “Destinations For The Months” feature, which helps travellers plan the best seasonal itineraries, such as heading for Kyoto in winter or Seoul in spring.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 26th, 2025",
