Indonesia is ready to strengthen cooperation with China for us to create a peaceful region, which is safe for all,” Prabowo said.\n\nPrabowo and Li oversaw the signings of several agreements, pledging closer cooperation in areas including economic development and finance.\n\nThe presidential palace later announced that eight other agreements were signed in sectors covering tourism, health, investment and media.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 26th, 2025",
