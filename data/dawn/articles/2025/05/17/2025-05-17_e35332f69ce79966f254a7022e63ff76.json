  "content": "THE HAGUE: The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor has stepped aside pending the conclusion of a probe into a misconduct allegation against him, his office said on Friday, as media reports cite accusations of sexual misconduct.\n\nNews of Karim Khan’s leave has plunged the ICC, already under fire from critics and targeted by US sanctions aimed at the prosecutor, into further uncertainty.\n\nThe UN Office of Inter­nal Oversight Servi­ces announced its investigation in November, with reports saying Khan was accused of sexual misconduct towa­rds a member of his office.\n\nKarim Khan, 55, denies the allegations.\n\nKhan “communicated his decision to take leave until the end” of the UN internal investigation, and his deputy prosecutors will run the office in his absence, his office said in a statement.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal claimed that an assistant, a woman in her 30s, told UN officials that Khan touched her in a sexual manner in Dec 2023.\n\nAfter allegations of misconduct became public, Khan said in October he would cooperate with any probe and denied wrongdoing. “It was with deep sadness that I understood reports of misconduct were to be aired publicly in relation to me,” Khan said.\n\n“There is no truth to suggestions of such misconduct,” he said in a statement.\n\nThe British lawyer took up his position with the Hague-based court in June 2021.\n\nThroughout his career — from courtrooms in England and Wales, to leading cases before international tribunals — he has faced down controversy for his legal work. Stints included defending Liberia’s former president Charles Taylor against allegations of war crimes in Sierra Leone, Kenya’s President William Ruto in a crimes-against-humanity case at the ICC that was dropped.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",
