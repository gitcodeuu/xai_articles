He pointed out that children in underprivileged areas were severely malnourished, and balanced nutrition played a crucial role in their physical development.\n\n“We are embarking on a journey that will fulfil children’s nutritional needs and strengthen their ability to fight illnesses,” he said.\n\nThe minister added that globally school meal programmes were seen as effective tools to improve learning outcomes.\n\nHe highlighted that Pakistan ranks among the 10 poorest countries in the world, with 42 per cent of its population living below the poverty line.\n\nIn such conditions, many parents cannot provide their children with balanced diet, which adversely affects their growth, he said, adding that when children receive meals at school, their attendance improves and they become more interested in learning.\n\nHe called the initiative a support system for poor families, as one daily meal at school can also help reduce household expenses.\n\nHe praised institutions like Allah Wale Trust for their local ownership and commitment to meaningful work.\n\nSpeaking about the programme’s importance, Allah Wale Trust Chairperson Shahid Lone said from that day 700 children at Government Boys Primary School in Murad Memon Goth would receive one free meal daily, with plans to gradually expand the programme to other schools.\n\nCentralised kitchens will be set up to prepare and deliver warm food while maintaining proper temperatures. Facilities for handwashing before and after meals will also be provided to students, he said.\n\nAdditional Secretary Dr Fauzia Khan stated that the programme will be evaluated on various parameters.\n\nTo measure its impact, the Body Mass Index (BMI) of students will be recorded before launching the programme in schools and again after four months. This will help monitor children’s growth, health, and other related issues.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",
