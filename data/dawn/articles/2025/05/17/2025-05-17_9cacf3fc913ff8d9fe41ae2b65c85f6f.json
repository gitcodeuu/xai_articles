  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), rebounded and rose by 1.29 per cent year-on-year in the week ending May 15, owing to a rise in the prices of sugar and meat in the retail market.\n\nThe SPI-based inflation rate had fallen for nine consecutive weeks, but an extraordinary spike in sugar and meat prices reversed the trend during the week under review.\n\nIt recorded a week-on-week increase of 1.03pc, official data showed on Friday.\n\nThis marks the third consecutive week of a week-on-week increase, mainly due to the rising prices of meat, chicken and sugar.\n\nThe retail price of sugar in the market has reached Rs190-200 per kg.\n\nThe overall short-term inflation rate has also slowed compared to the previous year due to a higher base. Moreover, prices remained stable for most products, excluding wheat flour and a few perishable items.
