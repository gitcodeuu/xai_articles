The policy aims to ensure that more than 30 per cent of new vehicles introduced in Pakistan by 2030 are electric.\n\nThe NEV policy incl­udes a subsidy of Rs50,000 for electric mot­orcycles and Rs200,000 for three-wheelers (rickshaws), with a total subsidy allocation of Rs4 billion. In addition, the policy provides for subsidies and support to establish EV infrastructure, such as charging stations.\n\nMeanwhile, on Thurs­day, PM’s special assista­­nt Haroon Akhtar Khan met a delegation from COMSATS to discuss the advancement of electric vehicle technology and motorcycle retrofitting in Pakistan.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Industries and Production Secretary Saif Anjum, COMSATS Executive Director Nafe­­es Zakaria and Engi­ne­ering Development Board CEO Khuda Bakhsh Ali.\n\nMr Akhtar emphasised that electric vehicles will bring significant economic and environmental benefits to the country. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to promoting clean energy and sustainable transport solutions, in line with the prime minister’s vision of a greener and economically resilient Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",
