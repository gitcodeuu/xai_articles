  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) Multan has raised serious concerns at the joint inquiry report into HIV cases at the dialysis unit of the Nishtar Hospital, demanding a transparent investigation into the matter.\n\nThe association has demanded the chief minister and governor to take notice of the issue and ensure a fair probe to uncover the truth.\n\nIn an emergency meeting chaired by Prof Dr Masoodur Rauf Haraj, the PMA Multan expressed unanimous reservations about the inquiry report, stating that the most critical question of how and why the HIV virus spread among dialysis patients remained unanswered.\n\nThey alleged that instead of identifying the real cause, the report appears to target the Nishtar Medical University’s first female vice chancellor as a part of a retaliatory campaign.\n\nThe PMA members alleged that a senior administrative officer at the NMU, allegedly aspiring to become the next VC, tried to influence the inquiry committee’s findings. They criticised the inquiry committee and relevant authorities for failing to determine whether the HIV virus was indeed transmitted through dialysis procedures at the Nishtar Hospital.\n\nMoreover, no action has been taken against unqualified medical practitioners who continue to operate freely across south Punjab nor had any officers from the Punjab AIDS Control Programme or Punjab Blood Transfusion Authority been held accountable.\n\nThe PMA Multan also pointed out that similar administrative negligence previously led to the detection of over 100 HIV cases among children in Taunsa Sharif. It noted that recommendations from the initial committee formed by the Nishtar VC were also ignored, resulting in no practical steps being taken to improve screening and treatment for HIV patients.\n\nProminent participants of the meeting included Dr Imran Qaisrani, Dr Nusrat Buzdar, Dr Ashfaq Siddiqui, Dr Momin, Dr Waqas Afzal, Dr Adnan Bashir and Dr Waqar Niazi.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",
