Karachi’s Sharafi Goth was also struck by drones, resulting in injuries to a security official,” he added.\n\nThe chief minister described the ensuing chaotic coverage in Indian media, which falsely claimed widespread destruction in Lahore, Sialkot, and Karachi. “It almost resembled a cartoonish portrayal,” he quipped.\n\nThe CM said: “It was during this critical juncture that Pakistan launched Operation Bunyan-um-Marsoos at 5:15am, an operation that garnered international attention within a mere three hours,” and added that the US Secretary of State contacted Pakistan at 8:15am, urgently requesting a ceasefire.\n\n“Our brave forces precisely targeted and neutralised 26 key Indian strategic sites, including Udhampur Airbase, Northern Command, Pathankot, Sirsa, Bathinda, Ambala, Jalandhar, Ferozepur, and numerous missile installations,” he said.\n\nThe chief minister also expressed profound gratitude to allied nations, including China, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, for their support.\n\nOpposition Leader Ali Khurshidi of the Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan said that people of Pakistan irrespective of their ethnicities, political affiliations and schools of thought responded to India as a nation.\n\n“We did not waste time in giving a befitting and effective response to the enemy and completed the work within few hours,” he said paying rich tributes to the armed forces.\n\nHe said that India had lost on the political, diplomatic and international fronts.\n\nMr Khurshidi also condemned the role of Indian media in the war environment, terming it shameful.\n\nHe said that the Pakistani army was a professional army and our nation was a great nation. “Our image has been raised all over the world, for which I pay tribute to the political and military leadership,” he added.\n\nEducation Minister Syed Sardar Shah said that Indian Prime Minister Modi did not want the development of India but its destruction. “He invited destruction by plunging his country into war and demonstrated madness,” he added.\n\nThe minister said that it was a matter of great joy that all the politicians of Pakistan had united on the occasion of war.\n\nJamaat-i-Islami lone lawmaker Muhammad Farooq said that Allah had united the entire Pakistani nation. “We should thank Allah for the success of the Pakistani army,” he said adding that when the time of trial came for the country, we united forgetting our own schools of thought and political parties.\n\nMr Farooq said that India had lost the war, now we would talk to it with full dignity.\n\nPakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf parliamentary party leader Shabbir Qureshi said that the Muslims around the world were comforted when missiles fell on India.\n\nHe said that India had thought that it was a right time to attack Pakistan due to the political situation in the country.\n\nRaising the slogan “Long live Pakistan, Long live Pak Army”, he said, that the Pakistani armed forces silenced the enemy’s guns.\n\nThe PTI members also paid rich tributes to late Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Abdul Qadeer Khan.\n\nPPP leaders including Health Minister Azra Pechuho, Home Minister Zia Lanjar, Irrigation Minister Jam Khan Shoro, Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, Deputy Speaker Anthony Naveed, Agha Siraj Durrani and Dr Sham Sunder and MQM-P’s Mahesh Kumar, Abdul Wasim and Iftikhar Alam also spoke.\n\nLater, Speaker Awais Qadir Shah adjourned the house to Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 17th, 2025",
