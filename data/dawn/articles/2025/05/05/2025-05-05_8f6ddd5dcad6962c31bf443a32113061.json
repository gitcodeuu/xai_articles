  "content": "LAHORE: In a pulsating encounter at Gaddafi Stad­ium here on Sunday night, Karachi Kings chased down a revised target of 168 in 14.3 overs to defeat Lahore Qalandars by four wickets in a rain-affected HBL Pakistan Super League match reduced to 15 overs per side.\n\nIrfan Khan’s explosive 48 not out off 21 balls, studded with five sixes, turned the game on its head, steering Kings to a dramatic victory with three balls to spare.\n\nThe match, a high-stakes affair with playoff implications, was interrupted by a 36-minute rain delay, but the intensity never waned.\n\nQalandars, batting first, posted a formidable 160-8, powered by Mohammad Naeem and Fakhar Zaman scintillating show. Kara­chi’s chase, initially rocked by early wickets, was resurrected by Irfan’s fearless strokeplay.\n\nKings got off to a flying start, with David Warner tak­ing on Asif Afridi’s left-arm spin for two sixes and two fours — all through the on-side — in the second over.\n\nThey had doubled the score up by the end of the third when Haris Rauf announced his arrival with a fast and furious delivery to see Warner (24 off 13, two fours and two sixes) play onto his stumps.\n\nWarner’s opening partner Tim Seifert (24 off 10, four fours and a six) followed his captain back to the pavilion in the fifth over to hand Asif his first wicket as the scoreboard read 58-2 at the end of the five-over powerplay.\n\nKings were deeper into problems when Vince holed out Rishad Hossain to Sikandar Raza, who took a brilliant low catch at deep midwicket.\n\nBut Saad Baig and Irfan — new on the crease at that point — counterattacked with confidence, the former dancing down to Rishad’s leg-spin to club hum through the cover for four before lifting the bowler over his head for a graceful six as Kings reached the 100-run mark by the end of the ninth over.\n\nThe introduction of med­ium pacer Daryl Mitchell in the next over, however, saw the right-armer trap Saad (25 off 15, three fours and a six) lbw before Haris returned to get Khushdil caught at deep point by Raza to leave Karachi needing 52 off 22 with five wickets down.\n\nBut Irfan turned it around for Kings when Qalandars captain Shah­een Shah Afridi came in to bowl the 13th over, lofting straight, hooking and pulling the pacer for three sixes before clearing square leg off Haris in the next over, which also saw Mohammad Nabi hit a six and a four.\n\nWith seven runs to win in the last over, Mitchell struck on the first ball to get Nabi, but Irfan, fittingly, lifted a full toss to see it sailing over long-off to get Kings over the line.\n\nEarlier, after being put in to bat first, Qalandars were benefited by impactful knocks by openers Naeem and Fakhar before Abbas Afridi led Karachi’s impressive response with the ball.\n\nNaeem hit a swashbuckling 65 off 27, bludgeoning six fours and and five sixes, while Fakhar played more of an anchor in his 33-ball 51, which was laced by four fours and three sixes.\n\nAfter some audacious hits had seen the pair put up 90 on the board by penultimate ball of the eighth over, rain stopped play for more than an hour, with Kings coming back as a better bowling team to break Qalandars’ flow of runs, with Abbas taking 4-27\n\nNaeem — who was dropped at 11 when Aamer Jamal spilled a sitter after the batter had skied a Hasan Ali bouncer in the second over — utilised the field restrictions and his immense power by smacking four fours and as many sixes to reach his half century off only 22 balls in the period.\n\nThe field spreading did not affect Naeem’s approach, with the right-hander rocking back to pull off-spinner Moham­mad Nabi for a four and perfectly executing a slog-sweep for six in the next over.\n\nIt was Aamer only, however, who got the dangerman’s wicket, as Naeem holed the pacer out to Irfan’s safe hand’s at long-on in the eighth over, right before rain started coming down and covers were brought on.\n\nAfter the break, Abd­ullah Shafique creamed two boundaries and a handsome six straight down the ground off Aamer to take Lahore to 116-1 at halfway stage, but Abbas broke the home side’s momentum.\n\nThe pacer trapped Abdullah lbw and castled the incoming Daryl Mitc­hell — who tried to go for a scoop — for a duck, striking on consecutive deliveries in the 11th over.\n\nSam Billings followed suit – the Englishman finding the safe hands of an airborne Aamer diving to his left at mid-off off Mir Hamza’s pace.\n\nAbbas returned to dismiss Sikandar Raza — striking onto the Zimbab­wean’s pads in front of the wickets — and destroying the stumps of Fakhar in the penultimate over.\n\nThe final over of the innings, bowled by Hasan, saw two wickets fall before Asif Afridi’s six took Lahore to 160-8. which was later revised, but still not enough for the side.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nLAHORE QALANDARS:\n\nFakhar Zaman b Abbas 51\n\nMohammad Naeem
