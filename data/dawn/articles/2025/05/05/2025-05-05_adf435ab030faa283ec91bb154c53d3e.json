Famine has officially hit five areas across Sudan, according to a UN-backed assessment.\n\nThe North Darfur region has been a particular battleground, with at least 542 civilians killed in the past three weeks, according to the United Nations.\n\nThe ICJ said it was “deeply concerned about the unfolding human tragedy in Sudan that forms the backdrop to the present dispute”.\n\n“The violent conflict has a devastating effect, resulting in untold loss of life and suffering, in particular in West Darfur,” the court added.\n\nA world away from the horrors on the ground, lawyers in robes and wigs thrashed out legal arguments in hearings last month in the panelled splendour of the ICJ’s Peace Palace.\n\nMuawia Osman, Sudan’s acting justice minister, told the court last month, “[The] ongoing genocide would not be possible without UAE complicity, including the shipment of arms to the RSF.”\n\n“The direct logistical and other support that the UAE has provided and continues to provide to the RSF has been and continues to be the primary driving force behind the genocide now taking place, including killing, rape, forced displacement and looting,” he added.\n\nResponding for the UAE, top foreign ministry official Reem Ketait said Sudan’s allegations were “at best misleading and at worst pure fabrications”.\n\n“This case is the most recent iteration of the applicant’s misuse of our international institutions as a stage from which to attack the UAE,” Ketait added.\n\nIn the end, legal experts had said Sudan’s case may flounder on technical jurisdictional issues.\n\n“There is clearly no basis for the court’s jurisdiction in this case,” the UAE’s Ketait told the judges.\n\nThe UAE had called for the case to be thrown out and removed from the court’s list.\n\nSudan argued the UAE’s reservation was “incompatible” with the purpose of the Genocide Convention, which emphasises global collective responsibility to prevent the world’s worst crimes.\n\nKhartoum wanted ICJ judges to force the UAE to stop its alleged support for the RSF and make “full reparations”, including compensation to victims of the war.\n\nThe rulings of the ICJ, which hears disputes between states, are final and binding, but the court has no means to ensure compliance.\n\nJudges ordered Russia to halt its invasion of Ukraine to no avail, for example, and ruled that Israel’s 57-year occupation of Palestinian land was illegal.",
