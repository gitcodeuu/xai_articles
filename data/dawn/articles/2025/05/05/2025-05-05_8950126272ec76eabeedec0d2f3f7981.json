While swimming, the boy went into deep sea and drowned, prompting his father to jump into sea to rescue him.\n\nHowever, his efforts failed as he and his son were overwhelmed by strong waves and lost their lives.\n\nEdhi Foundation volunteers retrieved the bodies and transported them to RHC Sheik­habad. After completing legal formalities, the bodies were handed over to the family.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 5th, 2025",
