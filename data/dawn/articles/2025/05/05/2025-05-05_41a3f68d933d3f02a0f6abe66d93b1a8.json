  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Sunday announced that it would not attend the government’s briefing over continuously escalating tension with India.\n\nThe main opposition party has instead suggested holding a multiparty conference (MPC) to take political parties into confidence over the issue and develop a joint course of action.\n\nThe PTI has made it clear that in case of any external aggression, the party will stand by the nation and the armed forces.\n\nIt was announced earlier on Saturday that the government would brief political parties over the situation. It was also announced that the briefing would be given by Information Minister Attaullah Tarar and Director General (DG) of Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry.\n\nThe PTI held a meeting of the party’s political committee to discuss the development and come up with its stance on the issue.\n\nMain opposition party suggests meeting of political stakeholders over the issue\n\nLater, in a statement shared by PTI’s Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram, the party said it has always condemned all forms of terrorism.\n\n‘One-sided briefing’\n\nHe said that incarcerated founding chairman of PTI Imran Khan has clearly condemned terrorism in his messages to the nation from jail and suggested that there should be national unity and internal stability.\n\nMr Akram made it clear that PTI has a very clear position that in case of any foreign aggression, the party would stand shoulder to shoulder with the nation and armed forces.\n\nHe said that it was also repeated during an event held on the PTI’s foundation day as the PTI passed a resolution that the party will strand by the nation and armed forces in case of any foreign aggression.\n\nHowever, he suggested that the government should call an MPC without any delay to take all political parties into confidence and formulate a joint strategy over the issue.\n\nWhile criticising the government, he said that it was strange that the government was holding a one-sided briefing instead of holding MPC in which input and suggestions should be sought from all participants of the MPC.\n\nMr Waqas said that Mr Khan was the true voice of the people of Pakistan and he always stressed for the national unity and political stability.\n\nHe alleged that it was just a government’s briefing and there will not be any sincere efforts to build consensus over the situation by calling national leaders such as Mr Khan.\n\nHe said that according to the party leadership the participation of PTI in the briefing was not necessary, so the political committee of PTI has decided not to attend the briefing to be given by the government.\n\nOn April 22 as many as 26 tourists were killed in Pahalgam, a popular tourist destination in the India-held Kashmir.\n\nWhile India blamed Pakistan for the incident, Pakistan termed it a false flag operation. Since then both countries have been exchanging heated statements.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 5th, 2025",
