  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Police have asked ride-hailing companies to affix a QR code, worth Rs200 issued by the capital police daily, on their vehicles as part of security measures and get every passenger verified by scanning the same code, claimed representatives of cab companies.\n\nPolice high-ups, however, denied these allegations, calling the information shared by the cab companies and police officials with Dawn, on the condition of anonymity, inaccurate.\n\nThe cab companies alleged the police were forcing the management of the services to get a set of QR codes worth Rs200 from an authorised vendor daily and paste them on their vehicles. Besides, they are also asked to scan the code for every passenger and pay Rs5 on behalf of them.\n\nThey alleged the police raided the offices of an online ride services operating in Islamabad on April 10 and temporarily sealed them. The police informed them that the offices were sealed, citing non-compliance with recently introduced data security protocols.\n\nRide-hailing companies say they have been told to get QR codes daily; police deny claims\n\nThe representatives claimed they were informed that their offices were sealed as they failed to respond to the notices served on them, adding that they had not received any notice.\n\nThey alleged that they had been asked to register with the police through a mobile application and also enter data on their drivers and vehicles for real-time verification. The representatives get the QR code from an authorised vendor of the Islamabad police at a cost of Rs200 per set. The vendor will make stickers of the QR code for each driver and vehicle at their own expense and stickers will be pasted on the vehicles.\n\nFaraz Ali Ansari, a spokesman for an online cab service, told Dawn that the police had asked them to get the QR code daily for Rs200 and pay Rs5 for every passenger scan as well. The spokesman said the police began issuing the QR codes last month and the drivers pasted the same on their vehicles. However, the scanning procedure has yet to be started, he added.\n\nSources in the police told Dawn that Rs200 per day fee for QR stickers and Rs5 per passenger would be collected for the “welfare and charity” of the police, including support for the families of the martyred police officials.\n\nAccording to the ride-hailing services’ representatives, the average number of active cabs for an online ride service in a month is about 30,000. The police will earn about Rs6 million per month from the QR code while the Rs5 passenger scan will generate up to Rs750,000 every month, they added.\n\nInspector General of Islamabad Police Syed Nasir Ali Rizvi, Director General Safe City Shakir Dawar, and SSP Operation Mohammad Iqbal were contacted for their version on the matter.\n\nSafe City DG Shakir Dawar replied, “This is totally incorrect and please don’t spread fake news.”\n\nThe IG did not give a version on the matter; however, when he was informed about the impolite responses by some police officials, he stated that they were simply stating that “the information is not correct”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 5th, 2025",
