  "content": "Pakistan on Monday conducted a successful training launch of a Fatah Series surface-to-surface missile with a range of 120 kilometres as part of ongoing “Ex Indus”, the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) said in a statement.\n\nThe test launch comes amid heightened tensions between nuclear powers Pakistan and India in the wake of New Delhi’s aggressive measures in the wake of a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir.\n\n“The launch was aimed at ensuring the operational readiness of troops and validating key technical parameters, including the missile’s advanced navigation system and enhanced accuracy,” the ISPR statement read.\n\nThe training launch was witnessed by senior officers of the army, as well as officers, scientists and engineers from Pakistan’s strategic organisations, the military’s media wing said.\n\nChairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir congratulated the participating troops, scientists, and engineers.\n\n“They expressed complete confidence in the operational preparedness and technical proficiency of [the] Pakistan Army to thwart any aggression against the territorial integrity of Pakistan,” the ISPR added.\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari congratulated scientists and engineers, as well as the nation, on the successful test of the Fatah missile, according to a post on X by the PPP.\n\n“The president appreciated the efforts of the security forces, scientists and engineers to strengthen the country’s defence.\n\n“[He] reiterated national commitment to ensure national security and defence.”\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the efforts of the chairman joint chiefs of staff, the army chief, and the scientists and engineers involved in preparation for the launch, according to a statement from the Prime Minister Office.\n\n“The success of the training launch clearly shows that Pakistan’s defence is in strong hands.\n\n“The prime minister expressed satisfaction over the professional capabilities of the Pakistan Army and its full preparedness for national defence,” the statement said.\n\nOn Saturday, the ISPR said that Pakistan had conducted a successful training launch of the Abdali Weapon System, a surface-to-surface missile with a range of 450km.\n\nIn May last year, the army conducted a test-launch of Fatah-II guided rocket system which had a range of 400km.\n\nThe guidance system makes this rocket a precision weapon enhancing its lethality and efficacy, while the trajectory mode and terminal guidance technology enables it to evade the enemy’s anti-ballistic missile systems.\n\nThe April 22 attack in Pahalgam killed 26 people, mostly tourists, in one of the deadliest assaults since 2000. India has implied cross-border links without evidence, while Pakistan has rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe.\n\nTensions have since spiked, with Pakistan reinforcing its forces as it expected an incursion and India’s premier granting “operational freedom” to his military. Pakistan witnessed shelling across the Line of Control (LoC) in AJK for a week since April 25, with the Pakistan Army responding to unprovoked Indian firing.\n\nA day ago, ISPR Director General Lt General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry and Federal Information Minister Attaullah Tarar briefed members of political parties on national security during an in-camera session in Islamabad.\n\n“If aggression is imposed on Pakistan, then the forces are ready to give a befitting reply to the enemy,” PTV News quoted the DG ISPR as saying.\n\nIt added that during the in-camera session, the information minister also informed the political leaders about the government’s diplomatic measures and the country’s stance.\n\nSeparately, state news outlet The Associated Press of Pakistan reported that the Pakistan Navy remained vigilant, fully prepared and ever ready to respond effectively to any aggression.\n\n“Defence sources revealed that during the night between May 4 and 5, the Pakistan Navy detected an Indian aircraft, P-8I, and kept it under continuous surveillance.”\n\nMeanwhile, India will conduct mock civil defence drills on Wednesday, government officials said, as fears rise of a regional conflict following the Pahalgam attack.\n\n“The Ministry of Home Affairs has asked several states to conduct mock drills for effective civil defence,” Kanchan Gupta, a senior adviser from the information ministry, said in a statement.\n\nGupta said this would involve rehearsing an “evacuation plan” and the “training of civilians, students, etc, on the civil defence aspects to protect themselves in the event of a hostile attack”.\n\nDrills will also test air raid warning sirens, prepare for blackouts and ready vital installations for camouflage.",
