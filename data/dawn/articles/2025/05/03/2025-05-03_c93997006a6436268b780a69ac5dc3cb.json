The conference focused on regional tensions, repeated Indian violations of the treaty, provocations along the Pakistan border, ceasefire violations, and broader threats to global peace.\n\nThe conference concluded with a unanimous resolution declaring that breaching the Indus Waters Treaty is tantamount to harming global stability.\n\n“Pakistan has always res­pected international laws, diplomatic agreem­ents, and global trust,” rel­igious leaders said. “The Indus Waters Treaty was a serious peace initiative by Pakistan. As a nuclear, military, ideological, and moral power, Pak­i­stan’s silence— along with that of its scholars and people — should not be mistaken for weakness.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
