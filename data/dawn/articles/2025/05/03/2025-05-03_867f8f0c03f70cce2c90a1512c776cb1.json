As a result, Mushtaq, 52, and his wife Rehana, 48, were critically injured.\n\nThey were shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where Rehana died during treatment. The condition of her husband was reported to be out of danger.\n\nThe DIG claimed that initial findings suggested reckless driving by the tanker driver was the main cause of the accident. However, he said, a preliminary technical assessment also indicated negligence on the part of the motorcyclist, who overtook the tanker from the left side, which is considered a blind spot for heavy vehicles.\n\nTruck hits bike\n\nA man was killed and another injured when a truck hit a motorcycle on National Highway on Friday, police said.\n\nBin Qasim SHO Tahir Qadri said that the pillion riders were hit by the truck near Ghaghar Phatak.

The police had arrested the errant driver, Naseer Ahmed, and seized the truck, the SHO added.\n\nPreliminary inspection revealed that the trailer had no documents such as fitness certificate or transport permit.\n\nMeanwhile, a passenger died after a Datsun van collided with a stationary trailer on M.M. Alam Road in the Malir Cantonment area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
