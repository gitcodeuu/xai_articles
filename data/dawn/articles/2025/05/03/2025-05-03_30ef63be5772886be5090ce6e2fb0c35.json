  "content": "KARACHI: The government has strongly rejected India’s claim that it has placed the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance after the Pahalgam attack, asserting that no party can unilaterally suspend the 1960 agreement, which remains binding under international law.\n\nFederal Law Minister Azam Naz­eer Tarar said the act itself was “ill­egal,” pointing out that the treaty explicitly states it shall remain in force until both countries mutually agree to amend or replace it.\n\n“There is a clear mechanism for any amendment to the treaty. Yes, we will respond to the letters India sent on April 8 and after that, in accordance with the language and clauses of the treaty,” he told reporters at Parliament House.\n\nResponding to a question, Mr Tarar noted that it was premature to say anything about any formal notice to India because New Delhi had claimed to have put the treaty “in abeyance”.\n\n“There is absolutely no such provision to unilaterally place the treaty in abeyance. That is why, probably, they have used vague language,” he said.\n\nHe added that Pakistan’s final response would be crafted in consultation with all relevant ministries, including foreign affairs, water resources, law and others.\n\nGlobally recognised pact\n\nSeparately, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik said that Islamabad would approach international forums, including the World Bank, regarding India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at a reception in his honour on Friday, Mr Malik reiterated Pakistan’s stance that New Delhi has no legal authority to suspend the treaty unilaterally.\n\n“The Indus Waters Treaty is an internationally recognised agreement, brokered by the World Bank, and contains no clause allowing for unilateral suspension,” he said.\n\n“Water is a vital national interest — a lifeline for 240 million Pakis­ta­nis,” he said, adding that such unil­ateral actions by India posed a dir­ect threat to Pakistan’s water security.\n\nMr Malik said that a legal strategy has been formulated by the government to take the issue forward. “Violations of the treaty could escalate regional tensions and trigger a global response,” he added.\n\nHe said Pakistan had raised the issue of India’s accusations with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, cal­l­ing for a neutral and transparent inv­estigation into the Pahalgam attack.\n\nHe said back-channel diplomacy was underway to de-escalate tensions between Islamabad and New Delhi.\n\n“We are in touch with international leaders through diplomatic channels,” he said, welcoming mediation efforts by Iran, China, Saudi Arabia, and other Gulf nations to prevent further escalation between Pakistan and India.\n\nAmjad Iqbal in Taxila also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
