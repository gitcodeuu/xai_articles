  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The demand for skilled Pakistani professionals in Japan will be expanding in the future, according to Japanese officials.\n\n‘PlusW’ Inc, a pioneering Japanese company in the Pakistani human resource sector, has renewed its partnership after five years with the signing of an additional MoU with the Overseas Employment Corporation to expand the Special Skilled Worker (SSW) programme.\n\nThe extended MoU was signed on the occasion of ’Pakistan-Japan Human Resources Stakeholders meeting on Friday.\n\nBuilding on the success of the existing collaboration in the IT sector, the addendum to the MoU formally widens the scope to include 14 additional priority sectors under the SWW framework - from nursing care and agriculture to construction and hospitality.\n\nThis expansion is not only timely but vital, as we seek to align Pakistan’s youth potential with Japan’s evolving workforce demands, said OEC Managing Director Naseer Khan Kashani, who inked the extended MoU.\n\nFounder and Chief Executive Officer PlusW Inc. Wakak Sakurai said Japan needs 820,000 specified skilled workers by 2028, and the country is still short of 525,000 SSW. In this regard, she listed 16 sectors where SSW will be needed.\n\nAmbassador of Japan to Pakistan Akamatsu said Japan is seeking high-quality human resources and by engaging with Japan, young Pakistani talent will contribute significantly to strengthening Japan-Pakistan relations.\n\nThe incremental growth of Pakistan IT talent in the Japanese industry, particularly in offshore development, has been remarkable. Japanese companies such as PlusW, Japan Station and Komatsu Pakistan Soft are leading the way, while new companies are emerging.\n\nFor the Pakistani talent themselves, working in Japan offers not only higher income but also more opportunities for career development through exposure to Japanese technology and business practices, he said.\n\nFor Japanese companies, improvements in Pakistan’s business environment are also essential.\n\nMinister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, Chaudhry Salik Hussain emphasised the need for enhanced cooperation between Pakistan and Japan to help Pakistani professionals access opportunities in the Japanese corporate sector.\n\nMinister for Information Technology Shaza Fatima highlighted the success of Pakistani IT companies at Japan IT Week in Tokyo last month, where 15 companies secured contracts exceeding $600,000.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
