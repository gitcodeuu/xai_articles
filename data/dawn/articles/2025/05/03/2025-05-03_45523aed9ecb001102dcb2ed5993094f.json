  "content": "MIAMI: US freestyle great Katie Ledecky posted the second-fastest 400m free time of her storied career on Thursday, clocking 3min 56.81sec to run down Summer McIntosh for a second stunning victory in as many days at the TYR Pro Swim Series meeting in Florida.\n\nLedecky, who posted the second-fastest 1,500m free time in history on Wednesday, overshadowed the return to action of Paris Olympic star Leon Marchand, who posted a personal best in finishing third in the men’s 400m free in his first competition in four months.\n\nWith the World Championships in Singapore coming up July 27-August 3, nine-time Olympic gold medallist Ledecky produced the fastest women’s 400m ever in a US pool — and her fastest since she set the American record of 3:56.46 in winning Olympic gold in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.\n\nCanada’s McIntosh, who had traded the world record with Ariarne Titmus in 2023 before finishing runner-up to the Aussie at the Paris Olympics, finished second in 3:58.28.\n\nThe World Championships promises to be another Ledecky-McIntosh duel with Titmus on an “extended break” before resuming training in preparation for the 2028 Olympics.\n\nMeanwhile, France’s Marchand made a solid return to competition in an event that didn’t feature among his four individual gold medals at the Paris Games.\n\nThe 22-year-old clocked 3:48.97 to finish third in the 400m free won by American Kieran Smith in 3:47.04, with Ryan Erisman second in 3:48.57.\n\nAmong other events on Thursday, American Shaine Casas won the men’s 100m freestyle in 48.47sec then returned to win the 50m backstroke in 24.41.\n\nUS veteran Regan Smith won the women’s 200m butterfly 2:05.38 — second fastest this season behind the 2:04.00 that Olympic champion McIntosh posted in March.\n\nMinutes after a runner-up finish in the 50m backstroke, Smith was able to hold off a pair of American teenagers in Alex Shackell and Audrey Derivaux.\n\nAmerican Gretchen Walsh won the women’s 100m free in a career-best 52.90sec, edging Paris Olympics silver medallist Torri Huske (52.95). They posted the first sub-53sec times of the year.\n\nDenis Petrashov of Kyrgyzstan, who swims in the United States for the University of Louisville, won the men’s 100m breaststroke in a personal best of 59.23.\n\nLithuania’s Aleksas Svickas was second in 59.72.\n\nAustrian Martin Espernberger won the men’s 200m butterfly in 1:55.71, storming from sixth at the halfway point to grab the victory over American Carson Foster, who clocked 1:55.84.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
