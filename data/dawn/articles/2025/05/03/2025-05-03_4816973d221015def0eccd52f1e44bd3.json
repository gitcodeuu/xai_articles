Worshippers prayed in front of the coffin covered by a green cloth.\n\nCisse was originally from the town of Yaguine in southwestern Mali, where he is due to be buried at a later date. “This is an absolutely incredible act of hatred in a very peaceful place,” Dominique Sopo, a representative of campaign group SOS Racisme, said.\n\nOn Monday, French authorities said they were investigating the killing as a suspected premeditated murder on grounds of race or religion.\n\nA man suspected of stabbing Cisse dozens of times and then filming his victim writhing in agony has surrendered to police in Italy after nearly three days on the run. A French national of Bosnian origin, he is now awaiting extradition to France.\n\nFrance is home to the largest Muslim community in the European Union, and the murder has put Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau, a hardline right-winger with a tough stance on immigration, under particular pressure.\n\nHe conspicuously did not visit the scene of the killing in La Grand-Combe and has been criticised for not finding the time to meet Cisse’s family.\n\nSpeaking to CNews, a broadcaster accused of fostering far-right views, Retailleau earlier this week said it was “difficult” to find Cisse’s family because he lived in France without a residence permit. He said that “Aboubakar Cisse was in an irregular situation.”\n\nFrench lawmakers on Tuesday observed a minute’s silence to honour Cisse and some lawmakers met with his relatives. According to a source close to the case, Retailleau will meet with members of Cisse’s family in Paris on Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
