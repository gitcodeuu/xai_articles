That much is obvious tonight and I accept full responsibility,” he told supporters.\n\nNot only was Albanese’s Labour Party on track for an unexpectedly large parliamentary majority, but former police officer Dutton faced the rare humiliation of losing his seat.\n\nElated Labour supporters swigged craft beers emblazoned with Albanese’s face at an election party in Sydney, chanting his “Albo” nickname as results were declared on TV.\n\n“This could be a big win for Labour,” said respected election analyst Antony Green from national broadcaster ABC.\n\nAlbanese has promised to embrace renewable energy, tackle a worsening housing crisis, and pour money into a creaking healthcare system.\n\nDutton wanted to slash immigration, crack down on crime and ditch a longstanding ban on nuclear power.\n\nUS President Trump cast a long shadow over the six-week election campaign, sparking keen global interest in whether his tariff-induced economic chaos would influence the result.\n\n“In times of instability, we expect people to go back to a kind of steady incumbent,” University of Sydney politics lecturer Henry Maher told AFP.\n\nDutton’s policy to slash the public service rankled as similar cuts, led by Elon Musk, brought chaos in the United States.\n\nAnd his flagship policy to dot the country with nuclear reactors was also widely seen as a liability.\n\nHungry voters munched on barbecued “democracy sausages” after casting their ballot — a polling day rite of passage — while others in bright swimwear crammed into booths after taking an early morning plunge.\n\nBefore the first vote was even counted, speculation was already mounting over whether Dutton could survive an election loss.\n\nSome pre-vote polls showed Dutton leaking support because of Trump, who he praised this year as a “big thinker” with “gravitas” on the global stage.\n\n“I mean, Donald Trump is as mad as a cut snake, and we all know that,” said voter Alan Whitman, 59, before casting his ballot on Saturday.\n\n“And we’ve got to tiptoe around that.”\n\nVoting is compulsory, enforced with fines of Aus$20, leading to turnouts that top 90 per cent.\n\nAs Australians soured on Trump, both Dutton and Albanese took on a more pugnacious tone.\n\n“If I needed to have a fight with Donald Trump or any other world leader, to advance our nation’s interest, I’d do it in a heartbeat,” Dutton said in April.\n\nAlbanese condemned Trump’s tariffs as an act of “economic self-harm” and “not the act of a friend”.\n\nEconomic concerns have dominated the contest for the many Australian households struggling to pay inflated prices for milk, bread, power and petrol.\n\n“The cost of living — it’s extremely high at the moment. So, taxes as well, is also another really big thing. Petrol prices, all the basic stuff,” human resources manager Robyn Knox told AFP in Brisbane.\n\nSmall business owner Jared Bell had similar concerns.\n\n“Our grocery shops are definitely way more expensive than they were a couple years ago,” he said.\n\nAlbanese’s government has embraced the global push towards decarbonisation, warning of a future in which iron ore and polluting coal exports no longer prop up the economy.\n\nThe 36-day campaign was a largely staid affair, but there were a few moments of unscripted levity.\n\nAlbanese tumbled backwards off the stage at a heaving campaign rally, while Dutton drew blood when he hit an unsuspecting cameraman in the head with a stray football.",
