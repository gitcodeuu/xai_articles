The Health Department was directed to ensure uninterrupted availability of medicines and medical staff, with all ambulances kept in functional condition.\n\nAll govt depts, institutions asked to remain on high alert; all leaves previously granted cancelled\n\nThe SDMA was designated as the focal agency for coordinating emergency response. It was tasked with ensuring the availability of non-food and non-perishable items in accordance with district-level contingency plans.\n\nThe possibility of using educational institutions as temporary shelters for displaced persons was also discussed. In case of prolonged tensions, strategies to minimise academic disruption for students were considered.\n\nThe Highways Department was instructed to keep the road connecting Naran (in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) with Neelum Valley’s Surgan area via Noori Top open for emergency movement and relocation.\n\nThe departments of Health, Education, Civil Defence, Communication and Works, Electricity, SDMA, and Rescue 1122 were declared essential services. All previously granted leaves for employees in these departments were cancelled with immediate effect.\n\nThe meeting learnt that around 427,000 people lived within five kilometres of the LoC in all 13 constituencies of the AJK Legislative Assembly — from Neelum to the southernmost Bhimber district — and were known for their resilience.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
