That aspiration isolated him politically.\n\n“His drive for greater power — viewed by many as fuelled by personal ambition — led to repeated confrontations with key ministers and most Council members.”\n\n“Over time, this power struggle eroded trust,” he added.\n\nBin Mubarak, Yemen’s former ambassador to the United States, is a staunch adversary of the Houthis, who abducted him in 2015 and held him captive for several days.\n\nHe previously served as chief of staff of the presidential office and was also appointed Yemen’s envoy to the United Nations in 2018. He was appointed foreign minister in 2018 and prime minister on February 5, 2024.\n\nBin Mubarak called on the European Union to designate the Houthis a terrorist group, and advocated increased military support for government forces as the Houthis launched Red Sea attacks.\n\nHis departure should “ease internal tensions and reduce the deep divisions that have plagued Yemen’s internationally recognised government — a necessary and positive step toward restoring cohesion”, Albasha said.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths and triggered one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises, although the fighting has decreased significantly since the United Nations negotiated a six-month truce in April 2022.\n\nSince fighting in the Gaza Strip broke out in October 2023 after Hamas attacked Israel, the Houthis have repeatedly targeted Israel and ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden that they say are linked to it.\n\nThe Houthis paused their attacks during a recent two-month Gaza ceasefire, but in March, their threat to resume attacks over Israel’s aid blockade of Gaza triggered a renewed and sustained US air campaign targeting areas in Yemen under rebel control.",
