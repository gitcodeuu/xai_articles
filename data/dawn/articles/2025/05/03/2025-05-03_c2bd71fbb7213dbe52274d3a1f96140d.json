Moreover, the petitioner had been kept in custody for over two months and the trial had not been commenced yet.\n\n“The reason why no charge has yet been framed against the petitioner is because, as admitted by the acting prosecutor general, no court and even no judge has been appointed for special courts as prescribed under the act of 2024. Under these circumstance it means that the applicant may be kept in jail for years before his trial even commences, simply because the government has failed to appoint judges to the special court,” it added.\n\nThe bench observed that it was completely unacceptable situation and depriving the petitioner of his fundamental rights including to expeditious trial which under the provincial law should be completed in six months.\n\n“In this case there is no judge and no trial as indictment has not been made yet and there were five prosecution witnesses,” it said, granting bail against a surety bond of Rs1 million.\n\nThe court directed the petitioner to attend the trial court on each and every hearing once the court was functional.\n\nThe bench also stated that as per acting prosecutor general, the special courts to try such offences under the 2024 law had not been established yet despite having exclusive jurisdiction to try such offences. “Not only this, but the government has not even appointed any presiding officer to act as judge of the special court,” it said.\n\n“Accordingly, a copy of this order shall be sent to the chief secretary and secretary law, government of Sindh, who shall ensure that special courts under the aforesaid Act are established immediately and the judges for such courts shall be appointed in accordance with law expeditiously so that these cases be tried and the petitioner and others may not be left languishing in jail without any recourse,” the bench ruled.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2025",
