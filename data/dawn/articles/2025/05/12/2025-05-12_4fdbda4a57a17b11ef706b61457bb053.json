Chief Minister Ali Amin Ghandapur issued on Sunday directives for the inquiry in a letter to chief secretary of the province.\n\nThe officials of Etea on Saturday busted the gang involved in malpractices including managing to take out question paper for the screening test from examination centre, solving its multiple choice questions (MCQs) and forwarding correct answers to candidates through different electronic gadgets.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that currently Etea has been conducting screening tests in different phases and areas of the province for appointment of 16,000 schoolteachers for which more than 0.8 million candidates have been registered.\n\nThe officials of Etea, district administration and law enforcement agencies busted the gang in Bannu at a time when its members were communicating with different candidates taking the test at 10 different examination centres, officials told Dawn.\n\nGang involved in scandal was busted during test for appointment of teachers\n\nEtea officials said that so far they arrested 10 members of the gang who were solving papers at a guest house in Bannu. FIR has been registered against them at Mirakhel police station. All of them are in police custody.\n\nOfficials have also confiscated a laptop, scanner-cum-photocopier, 10 mobile phones and various Etea papers.\n\nAs per initial report, one of the gang members and candidate at an examination centre established at University of Science and Technology Bannu managed to go out of the hall soon after receiving question paper and answer sheet from the invigilation staff.\n\nHe was chased by the officials of one of the intelligence agencies to reach their den. In the meanwhile, officials of Etea, district administration and police were informed to raid the guesthouse and arrest the gang members present on the spot, officials said.\n\nThe chief minister ordered a comprehensive and time-bound inquiry under the supervision of chief secretary to examine the sequence of events in the Bannu incident, including how test materials were accessed and removed. He ordered the chief secretary to investigate the modus operandi of the group and establish any pervious or wider linkages.\n\nThe chief minister has directed him to determine any lapses or complicity on part of Etea examination staff, centre supervisors, or district officials. He ordered him to review security protocols, IT systems and operational procedures of Etea to identify systemic flaws, if any, and recommend legal, disciplinary and administrative action against all those found involved or negligent.\n\nThe chief minister told the inquiry team to propose urgent reforms and safeguards to prevent future breaches particularly during high stakes provincial recruitments, review any potential impact on the validity of the 10th May test and recommend necessary remedial steps.\n\n“You are requested to kindly nominate a senior officer or group of officers of suitable experience and integrity to conduct the inquiry and submit a detailed report within 15 days, containing both finding and actionable recommendations,” says the letter of chief minister addressed to chief secretary.\n\nIn the same letter to the chief secretary, the chief minister has also directed the secretary of elementary and secondary education to review examination arrangements across the province, ensure active coordination with deputy commissioners and depute designated officers to oversee the integrity of recruitment process in collaboration with Etea.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 12th, 2025",
