It is also riding high in national polls, while Labour is struggling.\n\nHowever, Starmer’s tack to the right on immigration risks alienating Labour’s large base of liberal supporters, with the Liberal Democrats and the Greens picking up votes on the left.\n\nThe premier said that migrants “make a massive contribution” to Britain but alleged the country risks becoming an “island of strangers” without more controls.\n\nHe added that he wanted net migration to have fallen “significantly” by the next election, likely in 2029, but refused say by how much.\n\n“Every area of the immigration system, including work, family and study, will be tightened up so we have more control,” he told reporters at a Downing Street press conference.\n\nThe white paper also includes new powers to deport foreigners who commit offences in the country.\n\nCurrently, the government is only informed of foreign nationals who receive prison sentences.\n\nUnder the new arrangements all foreign nationals convicted of offences will be flagged to the government.\n\n“The system for returning foreign criminals has been far too weak for too long,” interior minister Yvette Cooper said on Sunday.\n\n“We need much higher standards.” The paper also includes new visa controls requiring foreign skilled workers to have a university degree to secure a job in the UK.\n\nAnd to reduce lower skilled migration Cooper has said she aims to cut 50,000 lower-skilled worker visas this year.\n\nOn the plans to double the length of time before migrants can make settlement or citizenship requests, high-skilled individuals “who play by the rules and contribute to the economy” could be fast-tracked, according to Downing Street.\n\nStarmer said Britain has “had a system that encourages businesses to bring in lower-paid workers, rather than invest in our young people”.\n\nCare England, a charity representing the adult care sector, said the decision to close social care visas to new applications from abroad was a “crushing blow to an already fragile sector”.\n\n“International recruitment wasn’t a silver bullet but it was a lifeline.\n\nTaking it away now, with no warning, no funding and no alternative is not just short-sighted — it’s cruel,“ said chief executive Martin Green.\n\nStarmer is also under pressure to stop the flow of migrants crossing the Channel from France to England on flimsy rubber dinghies.\n\nMore than 36,800 made the journey last year, according to British government figures, with several dozen dying.\n\nSeparate legislation to tackle irregular immigration, called the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, is currently going through parliament.",
