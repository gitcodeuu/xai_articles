India, without investigation or evidence, implied “cross-border linkages” of the att­a­­­c­kers. Pakistan firmly rejected the claim and called for a neutral probe. Following the allegations, India launched a series of drone strikes on Pakistan, resulting in civilian casualties.\n\nBoth sides then launched missiles at each other, which stretched over the week before US President Trump announced that a “full and immediate ceasefire” was reached between the two countries.\n\nA police official K Balaraju was quoted by The Wire as saying: “A couple of BJP workers showed up outside the Shamshabad Karachi Bakery within the RGI Airport Police Station limits at about 3 pm. They raised slogans and took issue with the bakery’s name. They tried to damage the signboard.”\n\nHe added that the suspects were detained but were later released as the owner did not want to press charges.\n\nThe bakery has been a renowned establishment in Hyderabad since 1953 and its name refers to the founder’s hometown prior to partition, according to The Wire. The outlet said that the bakery has continued to operate across India under this name despite various similar incidents during times of Pakistan-India tensions.\n\nSpeaking to The Indian Express, Balaraju was quoted as saying: “No employees at the bakery were harmed. No serious damage was done.”\n\nAnother branch of the Karachi Bakery was also targeted earlier, where the “protesters were seen planting tricolour flags”, the outlet added.\n\nA manager of the bakery told The Indian Express, “We are an Indian establishment. We cannot be branded Pakistani.”",
