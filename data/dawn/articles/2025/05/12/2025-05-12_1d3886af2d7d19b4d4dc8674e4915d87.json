The recruitment, on a locum basis, shall initially be for a period of one month, which may be extended if required.The government had made it clear that the recruitment on the locum basis shall not confer any right to permanent employment.\n\nAccording to the official agreement, the UHS shall directly disburse the payment to bank accounts of the locum doctors.\n\n“In case locum doctor wishes to discontinue at any time during one month period, he shall inform the concerned MS at least two days before leaving the place,” reads the letter.\n\nThe hiring process of the qualified nursing staff on the locum basis was also under process in Punjab as nearly 150 nurses have so registered themselves for the appointment with the UHS within two days or so.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 12th, 2025",
