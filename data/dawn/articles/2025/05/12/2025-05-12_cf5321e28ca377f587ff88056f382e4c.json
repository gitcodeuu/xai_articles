However, the repair took more time due to replacement of 32-foot piece of the damaged line.\n\nA spokesman for the water utility claimed that normal water supply to the city had been restored and different areas were being supplied as per the schedule.\n\nHowever, residents in different localities said that there was not a single drop of water in their taps for the past 12 days, making their life miserable.\n\nA resident of PECHS, Zaid Rabbani, said that no water had flowed in their locality since the water main burst at the university. “We somehow arranged water tanker, but after paying additional price,” he said.\n\nResidents of several localities said that the water supply was restored in their areas for a very short time.\n\nTauseef Ali Shah, a resident of Gulshan-i-Iqbal, said the supply was restored hardly for an hour. “The pressure was also too low and we could have only two buckets of water,” he lamented.\n\nSources in the water utility said the water pressure was kept low initially after the completion of the repair work as a precaution in view of the repair work on the damaged line.\n\nThey said the entire distribution network of the water utility had gone completely dried during the repair work and now the water level in different main lines in the city had got normal.\n\nThe sources said that the situation would normalise within a couple of days.\n\nLeakages in main lines have been frequent as all main lines of different diameters, ranging from 48 inches to 84 inches, were laid in 1956 and 1971 across the city.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 12th, 2025",
