The incident is subject to a live investigation and we will therefore not be commenting further,” a spokesperson for Starmer’s Downing Street office said.\n\nPolice said in a statement, without mentioning the British leader, that they were called to reports of a fire at around 01:35 local time (0035 GMT).\n\n“Officers attended the scene. Damage was caused to the property’s entrance, [and] nobody was hurt,” London’s Metropolitan Police said. “The fire is being investigated and cordons remain in place while enquiries continue.”\n\nThe London Fire Brigade said it attended a “small fire”.\n\nStarmer, who has a home in north London, has lived at his Downing Street office and residence since becoming prime minister last July.",
