  "content": "CAIRO: Talks between Hamas and the US administration on a ceasefire in Gaza and the entry of humanitarian aid to the besieged enclave are underway, a senior Palestinian official familiar with the discussions said on Sunday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump recently repeated a pledge to help get food to Palestinians in Gaza. A US-backed mechanism for getting aid into Gaza should take effect soon, Washington’s envoy to Israel also said on Friday.\n\nA State Department spokesperson said: “We cannot speak to ongoing negotiations, but I will note recent statements by Qatar and Egypt that they are continuing to engage in pursuit of an agreement.” The spokesperson said that Hamas bore “sole responsibility for the war as well as for the resumption of hostilities.”\n\n“President Trump has made clear the consequences Hamas will face if it continues to hold the hostages, including American Edan Alexander and the bodies of four Americans,” the spokesperson added.\n\nThe US had previously held discussions with the Palestinian militant group on securing the release of US hostages held in Gaza.\n\nIsraeli media reported on Sunday that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had told a closed session of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee that Hamas could soon release Alexander, an American-Israeli prisoner, as a goodwill gesture towards Trump, who will visit this Middle East this week.\n\nThe prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the reports.\n\nSince March 2, Israel has cut off all supplies to the 2.3 million residents of Gaza, and food stockpiled during a ceasefire at the start of the year has all but run out.\n\nOn March 18, Israel effectively ended the January ceasefire agreement with Hamas and renewed its military campaign in Gaza.\n\nHamas has said it is willing to free all remaining prisoners and agree to a permanent ceasefire if Israel pulls out completely from Gaza.\n\nIsrael, vowing the war can only stop once Hamas is stamped out, has said it plans to expand its military campaign in Gaza, which has been devastated during the war and prompted warnings from the UN that the population faces imminent famine.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 12th, 2025",
