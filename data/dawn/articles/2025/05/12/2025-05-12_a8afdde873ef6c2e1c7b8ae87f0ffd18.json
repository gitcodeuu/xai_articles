If our youth are given the right platform and support, they can bring international acclaim to the country,” he said.\n\nHe acknowledged the role played by Lt Gen Rahat Naseem Ahmed Khan, commander of 12 Corps and Mr Waseem in turning the dream of hosting this event in Balo­chistan a reality.\n\n“What seemed like an ambitious idea has now materialised into a historic achievement,” the CM said.\n\nBoxing star Waseem delivered a stunning performance on Saturday, defeating Vene­z­uela’s Ernesto Arinyo in the ninth round to clinch the WBA World Gold Bantamweight title. Local boxer Fatima Haz­ara and national boxer Sah­ir Iqbal also claimed victories in their title bouts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 12th, 2025",
