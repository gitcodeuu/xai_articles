  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In a bid to ease traffic congestion and improve connectivity, city authorities have decided to add an additional lane to the two-lane Srinagar Highway from Jinnah Square (Serena Interchange) to Murree Road.\n\nThe decision has been made as the Murree Road underpass nears completion with its formal inauguration set for May 22.\n\nThe CDA last week had floated tenders worth Rs1 billion for the “widening and improvement of roads work and structure in the surrounding of Jinnah Square.”\n\nMeanwhile, the ongoing work on the underpass at the junction of Murree Road and Srinagar Highway is in progress and near completion.\n\nSources said around 80pc work on the project had been completed and soon final touches would be given to the underpass.\n\nDecision comes as Murree Road underpass nears completion with its formal inauguration set for May 22\n\nAfter completion of the underpass, motorists coming from Murree side will have a direct access to Srinagar Highway. Currently, vehicles coming from Kashmir/Murree side have to go to Dhokri Chowk and take a right turn to enter Srinagar Highway.\n\nThe underpass is being constructed as part of the Rs4.2 billion Jinnah Square project. The CDA had a saving of Rs250 million from the main project which is being spent on the underpass project together with around Rs600m other funds.\n\nThe CDA board a few months ago allowed the engineering wing to get the work executed from the contractor of Jinnah Square after making part of it.\n\n“As per rules, the scope of the work could be increased up to 15pc so after getting approval from CDA board we increased the Jinnah Scare work to get the Murree Road project done from the same contractor without calling a new tender. Moreover, we also had a saving from the previous project,” said an officer of the CDA.\n\nApart from the underpass work, last week the CDA floated a new tender for widening of roads. Under this project, a new slip road will also be constructed to provide a link from Globe Chowk to Srinagar Highway.\n\nMeanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited the Jinnah Square Murree Road underpass project and reviewed the progress of the work. A press release issued by the interior ministry stated that the walls on both sides of the underpass had been completed while work on the roof has now been started.\n\nIt said that the underpass will be inaugurated on May 22.\n\n“During the inspection, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi directed that 100 per cent of the work should be completed within the current month. He expressed satisfaction over the pace and quality of development work despite recent rainfall.”\n\nIt said that the minister also instructed for the development of green areas and landscaping around the project. He also inspected the under-construction bridge near the underpass as well.\n\nCDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa while briefing on the project said that 75pc work had been completed. Out of the four slip roads, three have been completed and traffic has been restored on them for public convenience.\n\nThe minister was assured that the development work would be completed on time.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 12th, 2025",
