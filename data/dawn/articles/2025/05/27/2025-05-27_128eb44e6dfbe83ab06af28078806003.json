  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of National Food Security and Research has decided that a data collection and monitoring mechanism will be established to ensure transparency and efficiency in the sugar sector.\n\nThe decision was taken during a meeting on Monday to review and assess the current situation of sugar stocks. The system will be instrumental in accurately tracing the production and yield of sugarcane across the country, the ministry says in a press release.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain emphasised the importance of reliable and real-time data. “Decisions regarding the import and export of sugar will henceforth be based on verifiable data collected through this new system. This will help stabilise domestic markets and safeguard the interests of both farmers and consumers,” he said.\n\nRana Tanveer directed all departments to work in close coordination to finalize and implement the proposed systems at the earliest, ensuring uniformity, transparency, and accountability in sugar sector management.\n\nThe government has set the target for sugarcane production at 80.3 million tons over an area of 1.1 million hectares during the upcoming kharif season.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
