  "content": "QUETTA: The Balo­chistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) will lau­nch a countrywide mov­ement after Eidul Azha along with other political parties against the detention of Baloch Yakjehti Committee chief organiser Dr Mahrang Baloch, PTI founding chairman Imran Khan, Ali Wazir and other political prisoners.\n\nThis was announced by BNP-M’s Central Senior Vice President Sajid Tareen at a press conference on Monday.\n\nHe alleged that by gagging the media, an undeclared martial law has been imposed in the country. He said that a case had been filed in the BHC for the release of Dr Mahrang, Beebo Baloch, Sibgh­atullah Shah, Bebarg Baloch and other BYC leaders. When the BHC’s bench No 1 took up the case, it became evident from their attitude that they were biased and facilitating the government, he alleged.\n\nHe said the BNP-M staged a walkout and expressed its reservations over the case proceeding, claiming that the courts were being used to deliver favourable judgements.\n\nHe regretted that Balochistan has been pushed to the brink of destruction during the past 77 years.\n\nMr Tareen lamented that political activists were being cornered and prevented from engaging in demo­cratic struggle.\n\nTher­efore, he added, a countrywide movement would be launched after Eid to press for the release of Dr Mahrang, Imran Khan, Ali Wazir and others.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
