  "content": "LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday launched CM’s Insulin Card programme, aimed to provide free insulin and other paraphernalia to the children suffering from type-I congenital diabetes through the Pakistan Post riders at their doorstep.\n\nThe CM kicked off the programme by personally delivering the insulin card, along with glucometer, BSR strips and a box of needles, to three diabetic children – Wasay Adnan, Zainab Waheed and Zain Shahzad – at their houses in Sabzazar and Jamil Town. The CM also ordered Zain Shahzad’s eye check-up and treatment.\n\nInteracting with the family members of the diabetic children, the CM said she also felt concerned about their health.\n\n“I can understand the pain and anxiety of the children suffering from diabetes. The free insulin programme for young children has been launched on the demand of poor parents and children,” she said, and added that under the ‘Sehatmand Punjab’ vision, the government would reach out to every child who could not afford to buy medicine or insulin.\n\n“Children’s health is of foremost importance for the Punjab government. For the first time, children are being provided with glucometers and test strips along with insulin. Children are the bright future of the nation, and all resources are being placed at their disposal. The rapid spread of diabetes among children is a matter of grave concern,” she said.\n\nDuring the programme’s first phase,1,500 children will be provided insulin at their doorstep. Riders of the Pakistan Post will verify the insulin card by scanning it through a special app and deliver free insulin to the patients.\n\nThe riders have been directed to ensure the cold chain procedure while delivering the three-month insulin doses door to door to the children suffering from type-1 diabetes.\n\nThe patients are required to visit the district or sub-district headquarters hospitals for their quarterly follow-up check-ups.\n\nChildren suffering from type-1 diabetes can register at the NCD Clinic, Maryam Nawaz Health Clinic or on the Healthline app 1033.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
