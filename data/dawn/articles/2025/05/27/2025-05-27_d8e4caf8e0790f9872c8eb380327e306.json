Consequently, the committee rejected the bill.\n\nThe Power Division’s special secretary defended the bill, explaining that it aimed to simplify the FIR process and ensure accountability for individuals who assist in power theft under sections 182, 185 and 109 of the PPC.\n\nIn December 2023, then-president Dr Arif Alvi promulgated an ordinance making the theft of electricity a cognisable offence. Section 460(O) of the PPC was amended under the ordinance binding the police to register an FIR on the complaint of a government officer of grade 17 or above, as well as officers of Discos.\n\nThe ordinance, which had been extended later for 120 days, failed to obtain the necessary approval from parliament to become permanent legislation and finally lapsed in August 2024, leaving the power sector without an effective legal framework to deal with the challenges of high losses and low recoveries.\n\nAnti-rape bill\n\nThe committee unanimously recommended the passage of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) (Amendment) Bill, 2025, proposed by MNA Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar.\n\nThe bill aims to establish child courts in every district, city or jurisdiction, exclusively tasked with hearing cases of child abuse, including physical, sexual, emotional abuse and neglect.\n\n“These specialised courts will ensure that child victims receive justice through a legal process that is both efficient and sensitive to their needs. By establishing specialised courts, introducing expedited trial processes and prioritising victim protection, this bill aims to strengthen the legal framework for the protection of children and ensure that child abuse cases are addressed swiftly and sensitively, with the best interests of the child at the forefront,” read the statement of objects and reasons of the bill.\n\nA new section 17A proposed to be inserted calls for bail in such cases only in exceptional circumstances. “In cases of sexual abuse, physical abuse, or exploitation of children, the court shall deny bail unless exceptional circumstances exist.”\n\nThe draft bill said courts shall consider the best interests of the child victim, including the potential for further harm or intimidation by the accused.\n\nMoreover, bail may only be granted after a careful assessment of the child’s safety and welfare,”it read.\n\nThe committee also considered the Criminal Law (Amendment) Bill, 2024, moved by MNA Sofia Saeed Shah.\n\nThe bill was deferred with a directive for the mover to consult with the Ministry of Law and Justice and introduce amendments if necessary.\n\nAdditionally, three bills proposed by MNA Sharmila Faruqui — the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill, 2024 (Schedule-II), the Corrosive Substances Assault (Prevention and Protection) Bill, 2024, and the Islamabad Capital Territory Dowry Restraint Bill, 2025 — were also deferred till the next meeting at the request of the mover.\n\nWedding halls\n\nThe committee recommended summoning the officers concerned of the Pakistan Coast Guards (PCG) to address issues regarding the construction of over 100 wedding halls in Malir, Karachi. However, the PCG director general was not present at the meeting.\n\nThe committee also discussed FIR No. 117/2024 registered against Jamshaid Ahmed Dasti, a PTI-backed MNA, and asked the district police officer and regional police officer of Muzaffargarh to attend the next meeting to brief the panel on the matter.\n\nThe report of a subcommittee on the murder case of Mustafa Amir in Karachi was presented before the committee for its further consideration and recommendations.\n\nThe meeting was attended by MNAs Anjum Aqeel Khan, Chaudhary Naseer Ahmed Abbas, Syeda Nosheen Iftikhar, Malik Shakir Bashir Awan, Haji Jamal Shah Kakar, Sardar Nabeel Ahmed Gabol, Abdul Qadir Patel, Khawaja Izharul Hassan, Mohammad Jamal Ahsan Khan, Nisar Ahmed, Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, Muhammad Arshad Sahi, Jamshaid Ahmed, Zartaj Gul, Sofia Saeed Shah and Sharmila Faruqui.\n\nWaqas Ali Mahmood, the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control special secretary; Arshad Majeed, the Power Division special secretary; Muhammad Ali Randhawa, CDA chairman; Irfan Memon, Islamabad deputy commissioner; and senior officials from relevant divisions and departments also attended the meeting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
