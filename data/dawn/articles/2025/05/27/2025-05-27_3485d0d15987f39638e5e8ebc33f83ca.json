  "content": "LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmad Khan has strongly indicated his opposition to the proposed “Goonda Act” drafted by the home department, vowing to resist its implementation even if it means approaching Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. He declared he would not support such a law and would go “wherever I had to go.”\n\nDuring the assembly session requisitioned by the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and began 2:13 hours late, he also offered “free advice” to PTI, urging them to abandon talks of bringing a no-confidence motion against the government.\n\nHe claimed that many parliamentarians within PTI’s ranks are against the party’s political style, suggesting that 20 to 25 PTI members might desert the party during a no-confidence vote.\n\nKhan emphasised the need to eradicate terrorism and condemned the act of disguising crime as politics. He also accused RAW of involvement in terrorism in Balochistan, stating that the Pakistan Army would eliminate it.\n\nUrges PTI to abandon no-confidence plans; MPA protests ‘26pc hike’ in private schools fee during summer break; another member wants removal of PCB head\n\nDuring the session, MPAs raised concerns regarding delayed agendas and the delegation of law-making authority to bureaucracy in new legislation, a point acknowledged by Speaker Khan. He specifically cited the 1972 Act, stating that an MPA should head committee meetings, if present.\n\nOpposition MPA Ahmar Bhatti protested a 26 per cent increase in private school fees for summer holidays, citing a High Court decision for half fees. The speaker referred the matter to the Standing Committee on Education.\n\nParliamentary Secretary for Sports Anas Mahmood answered questions, and the issue of Pakistan’s football team participating in FIFA was raised. The chair sarcastically commented on the state of sports federations in the country, saying if Chaudhry Shujaat would be leading the Kabaddi Association and Arshad Lodhi Football Association, then what to expect by joining the FIFA-led tournaments.\n\nPTI’s Hafiz Farhat Javed criticised the leadership of sports boards, suggesting that Mohsin Naqvi, current PCB chairman, should also be replaced.\n\nTreasury member Ahmed Iqbal raised concerns about local government work quality and corruption affecting road construction.\n\nAmjad Ali Javed, also a ruling party MPA, expressed frustration over his adjournment motion not being on the agenda and questioned if members could speak against “systemic Brahmins.”\n\nPPP MPA Mumtaz Chang noted that the agenda was changed after six months when questions were submitted.\n\nThe session faced a quorum issue, prompting Speaker Khan to order the bells to be rung twice for five minutes each. He noted that the requisitioning party was responsible for ensuring the quorum.\n\nThe proceedings were later deferred for Tuesday (today) afternoon on completion of agenda.\n\nAddressing a ceremony later, Speaker Khan said the present era is one of dialogue and the supremacy of the Constitution. Whether a democratic system exists or not, every country has some form of legislative institutions. Only by strengthening the Parliament and elected representatives can the system be fortified.\n\nNo political party should be allowed to gain popularity by criticising the armed forces, he said, adding that the abolition of institutions like NAB (National Accountability Bureau) could not materialise due to the intervention of the judiciary at the time.\n\nHe reminded that former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had said that if he tried to abolish NAB, the chief justice would have his throat slit.\n\nHe stated that the same parties currently criticising the military had in the past come into power with its support. Referring to the economic situation, he said that negotiations with the IMF are ongoing, but the economy cannot be strengthened unless the public pays taxes, but politicians often avoid taxation to protect their vote bank.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
