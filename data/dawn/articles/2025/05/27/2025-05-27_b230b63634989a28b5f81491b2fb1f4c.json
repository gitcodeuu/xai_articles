The planned route will connect the ICI Bridge, KPT, Gulbai, and Hub Chowki directly to Hyderabad.\n\nIt was decided that full planning for the project would be carried out to ensure its execution. The motorway is expected to divert heavy and port traffic directly to Hyderabad, alleviating congestion within Karachi.\n\nMedia talk\n\nTalking to the media later, the federal communication minister stated that the construction of the motorways in Sindh was a top priority of the federal government.\n\nHe announced that the M-6 and M-10 motorways would be launched simultaneously. “The M-6 is Pakistan’s lifeline, which was unfortunately neglected by previous governments,” he added.\n\nHighlighting the significance of the M-6 Project, the federal minister shared that it was a nearly Rs400 billion initiative comprising five sections, each approximately of 60-km long. “There is no better opportunity for investment than this project,” he pointed out.\n\nAbdul Aleem Khan said that financing had already been secured for two sections, while discussions for the remaining three are ongoing. “Insha’Allah, we will finalise the feasibility report and present it to the prime minister within the next 15 days,” he added.\n\nThe federal minister said that the motorways from Karachi to Hyderabad and from Hyderabad to Sukkur would be completed as early as possible, while work on the N-25 Highway from Karachi to Quetta was also scheduled to begin later this year.\n\nThe federal minister said that the NHA had recorded unprecedented growth in revenue over the current fiscal year and attained the target from Rs64bn to Rs110bn.\n\nHe also held a highly productive meeting with the business community led by Arif Habib, where investors expressed interest in participating in the development of Sindh’s motorways and road networks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
