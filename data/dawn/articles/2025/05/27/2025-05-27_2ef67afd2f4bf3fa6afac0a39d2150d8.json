However, he reaffirmed that if India remained aggressive, Pakistan would defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nThe prime minister said he had a productive and useful meeting with the Iranian president, covering all areas of mutual interest and cooperation.\n\n“There was total agreement that the two brotherly neighbouring countries must enhance cooperation in diverse fields, including trade, investment and economy,” he added.\n\nStressing that Pakistan and Iran had deep-rooted cultural and historical relations, he said, “We have decided to transform these relations into a very productive cooperation in various fields of life.”\n\nPM Shehbaz also thanked the Iranian president for calling him and showing his concern on the evolving situation in the subcontinent a few weeks ago.\n\n“I deeply appreciate your concern and brotherly feelings for the people of Pakistan and your ardent desire that this crisis comes to a grinding halt instead of escalating further,” he told the president.\n\nIsraeli actions condemned\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz said Pakistan condemned Israeli actions causing untold misery for the people of Gaza, where Israel murdered more than 50,000 Palestinians, and the bloodshed continues.\n\n“It is high time that the international community used its influence to bring a lasting ceasefire in Palestine. Pakistan stands by its brothers and sisters in Iran to promote peace, progress and prosperity,” he said.\n\nHe said Pakistan fully supported Iran’s right to have a civilian nuclear programme. He assured that Pakistan would work with Iran on all issues of mutual concern.\n\nThe Iranian president stressed that Pakistan and Iran shared a common stance on important regional and international issues on different platforms, including the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\n\nPresident Pezeshkian said the two countries should cooperate on making their borders secure from the activities of terrorists and criminal groups.\n\n“Peace and stability in Pakistan are in the interest of Iran. We believe that sustaining security and maintaining friendly and peaceful relations with neighbouring countries is in the interest of the two countries,” he added.\n\nHe said Iran welcomed the ceasefire between Pakistan and India, adding that settling issues through dialogue was essential for stability in the region.\n\n“We believe that to ensure security and stability in the region, neighbouring countries should hold dialogue and have positive consultations with each other and the international partners,” he added.\n\nHe said the two sides discussed issues facing the Islamic world and the top priority was the issue of Palestine.\n\n“As always, we support the cause of Palestine and condemn the atrocities carried out by Israel,” he added.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Information Minister Attaullah Tarar, and Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Fatimi accompanied the prime minister.\n\nPM meets Khamenei\n\nLater, Prime Minister Shehbaz made a courtesy call to Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran.\n\nAccording to the PM Office, the prime minister briefed the supreme leader about the recent conflict with India and its hegemonistic and revisionist designs. He thanked the Iranian leadership for supporting Pakistan against Indian aggression.\n\nThe premier underlined that Pakistan always desired peace to prevail in the region leading to economic development and prosperity.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz briefed the supreme leader about the steps taken to elevate Pakistan-Iran ties to highest levels and maintained that his government was committed to further deepening strategic cooperation with Iran in the complex geopolitical times.\n\nHe praised the farsightedness of the Iranian leadership in pursuing the nuclear negotiations with the United States and hoped that a constructive deal would be reached between the two countries.\n\nThe supreme leader appreciated PM Shehbaz’s efforts in promoting regional peace and stability and praised his commitment to further strengthening Pakistan-Iran ties. The supreme leader also prayed for greater prosperity, growth and development of Pakistan and its people.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
