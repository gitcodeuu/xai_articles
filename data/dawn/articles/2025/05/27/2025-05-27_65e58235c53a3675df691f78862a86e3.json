I appeal to the media to amplify the truth: the polio vaccine is safe, effective, and our best weapon.”\n\nHe reiterated his support for his daughter Aseefa Bhutto-Zardari, “whose tireless advocacy and efforts has galvanized our nation in this fight against polio”.\n\n“Today, I also pay tribute to our brave polio workers, who risk their lives to reach every child, often in the face of grave danger.\n\n“We also honour those polio workers and security officials who have made the ultimate sacrifice, losing their lives to cowardly attacks aimed at derailing our efforts to make Pakistan polio-free,” he said.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also condemned the incident and affirmed that strict action will be taken against militant elements targeting the polio campaign, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the incident and said that an attack on the team tasked with securing the safe future of children is intolerable.\n\nBalochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar strongly condemned the incident, describing it as a “cowardly and inhumane act.”\n\nHe emphasised that targeting the polio campaign is equivalent to attacking the future of innocent children. While paying tribute to the martyred official, the minister hailed him as a “hero of the nation.”\n\nKakar warned that any effort to derail the polio campaign would be seen as a direct challenge to the writ of the state, and affirmed that the government will deal with terrorists with an iron fist.\n\nYesterday, two polio workers were abducted by armed assailants in Tank district while performing their duties in the Dolat Koruna area as part of the ongoing vaccination drive which kicked off on Sunday.\n\nThe Pakistan Polio Programme launched the third drive of the year against the crippling disease at the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), Islamabad.\n\nThe campaign was formally inaugurated by Prime Minister’s Focal Person for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq, alongside members of the Polio Programme’s core group and representatives of partner organisations, the statement added.\n\nAdditional reporting by Imran Gabol and Nadir Guramani",
