  "content": "JERUSALEM: A large rally in Jerusalem marking Israel’s capture of the city’s east in a 1967 war descended into chaos on Monday as far-right Israeli Jews confronted and assaulted Palestinians, fellow Israelis and journalists, witnesses said.\n\nThe annual “Flag March” drew thousands chanting, dancing and waving Israeli flags shortly after far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir visited the Al Aqsa mosque compound, a longtime flashpoint of Israeli-Palestinian tensions.\n\nThe march frequently stokes tension as ultranationalist Jews stream into Palestinian areas of Jerusalem’s walled Old City en route to the Western Wall.\n\nViolence broke out in the walled Old City of East Jerusalem shortly after midday, an eyewitness said, when young marchers began harassing the few Palestinian shopkeepers who had yet to shutter their stores ahead of the rally.\n\nThe marchers, mostly young Israelis who live in settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, then began to target Israeli left-wing activists and journalists observing the rally.\n\nIsraeli minister Itamar Ben Gvir visits Al Aqsa compound\n\nThe demonstrators shouted nationalistic slogans and called for violence against Palestinians, chanting: Death to Arabs. A Palestinian woman and journalists were spat on by a group of young settlers, and nearby Israeli police did not intervene, eyewitness said.\n\nA police officer at the scene said young Israeli marchers could not be arrested because they were under the age of 18. Moshe, a 35-year-old Israeli settler from the West Bank and supporter of the current right-wing government, walked through a Palestinian neighbourhood of the Old City with a rifle slung over his shoulder and his daughter on his shoulders.\n\nIt was a very happy day because all of Jerusalem was under the government of Israel, he said, declining to give his last name.\n\nLeft-wing opposition leader Yair Golan, a former armed forces deputy commander, described images of violence in the Old City as shocking. He said in a statement: “This is not what loving Jerusalem looks like. This is what hatred, racism and bullying look like.”\n\n“We will keep Jerusalem united, whole, and under Israeli sovereignty,” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a cabinet meeting held in East Jerusalem earlier on Monday.\n\nA spokesperson for the Palesti­nian presidency based in the occupied West Bank condemned the march and Ben Gvir’s visit to Al Aqsa.\n\nIsrael’s ongoing conflict in Gaza, “repeated incursions into the Al Aqsa mosque compound and provocative acts such as raising the Israeli flag in occupied Jerusalem threaten the stability of the entire region,” Nabil Abu Rudeineh said in a statement.\n\nClashes flared throughout the day as left-wing Israeli activists intervened to escort Palestinians away from young far-right Israeli Jews threatening passersby, witnesses said. Journalists covering the rally were repeatedly harassed and in some instances assaulted, eyewitness said.\n\nMost countries consider East Jerusalem to be occupied territory and do not recognise Israeli sovereignty over it. In 2017, US President Donald Trump recognised all of Jerusalem as Israel’s capital and moved the US embassy there from Tel Aviv.\n\nOn Sunday, US Ambassador Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian, congratulated Israel on what he called the reunification of the city 58 years ago.\n\nMinister in Al Aqsa compound\n\nEarlier, Ben Gvir visited the Al Aqsa mosque compound in the walled Old City. Ben Gvir said in a video filmed at the elevated compound that the site was being flooded by Jews. “Today, thank God, it is already possible to pray on the Temple Mount,’’ he said.\n\nUnder a decades-old arrangement, the compound is administered by a Jordanian Islamic trust. Jews, who regard the compound as the site of two ancient temples, are allowed to visit but not pray there.\n\nBen Gvir, whose visit was condemned by the Palestinian Authority and Jordan — has along with others on the far right in Israel long pushed for Jewish prayer rights at the site.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
