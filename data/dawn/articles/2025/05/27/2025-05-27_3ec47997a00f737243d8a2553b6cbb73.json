While these initiatives have helped mobilise remittances and foreign investments, their benefits have largely concentrated in sectors like real estate and have not significantly contributed to industrial or agricultural productivity, said the report.\n\nTo address these challenges, PRAC recommended a series of targeted reforms. These include adjusting yields on investment certificates, lowering remittance transfer costs, directing RDA inflows tow­ards special economic zones (SEZs) and agro-processing, and simplifying regulations on corporate foreign currency accounts. Furthermore, the report proposes a shift towards a managed-float or “peg-and-revalue” exchange rate regime, anchored to the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER), to enhance currency competitiveness and reduce volatility.\n\nBy implementing these strategic measures, Pakistan can strengthen its foreign exchange management, build economic resilience, and lay the foundation for sustainable, export-led economic growth, it suggested.\n\nThese pressures emphasise the need for a robust and dynamic reserves-management framework to cushion against oil-price spikes, political instability, and other external shocks, said the report.\n\nAlthough remittances have proven resilient, they remain insufficient as a standalone buffer for Pakistan’s reserves. Measures such as the RDA and NPCs have helped increase remittances and attract foreign investment, but their impact is concentrated in sectors like real estate, with limited influence on industrial and agricultural growth.\n\nTo better leverage diaspora capital, the report recommended dynamically adjusting the yields on NPCs to align with domestic monetary policy, reducing remittance transfer fees, and channeling RDA deposits into high-impact areas, such as SEZs and agro-processing industries.\n\n“The country has alternated between fixed and floating exchange rate systems, contributing to significant depreciation in recent years. This depreciation has exacerbated trade deficits, inflated import costs, and weakened economic stability,” the report said, noting that amore strategic and stable approach to forex reserve management is essential to protect the currency and ensure resilience in the face of external shocks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
