It also directed not to bill its consumers on average consumption basis.\n\nThe body, presided over by its chairperson Nuzhat Sadiq, met here in Parliament House to take up assurances given by the ministers on floor of the House regarding over-billing in Karachi, establishment of Protectorate of Emigrants Office in District Mansehra, rehabilitation of roads devastated by floods in Sindh and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and over-billing of gas in Balochistan.\n\nThe committee was apprised that KE was conducting massive unscheduled loadshedding in different areas of Karachi apart from billing its consumers on average basis adding to the miseries of people. It directed KE management to immediately address these issues and maintain close coordination with elected representatives of the city for addressing the menace of kunda culture and to bring people in the metering system.\n\nThe KE management apprised the NA body Rs44 billion had accumulated on account of outstanding bills, kunda culture and non-metering in 2024.\n\nAbout the establishment of Protectorate of Emigrants Office in District Mansehra, the director general of bureau of immigration and overseas employment apprised the committee that instead of Mansehra, the government had approved establishment of the said office in Abbottabad.\n\nThe NA body also discussed report of the communications ministry regarding assurances given by its minister about repairs of highways devastated by floods and deplorable condition of Chakdara-Upper Dir Road.\n\nIt directed to the ministry and the National Highways Authority (NHA) to expedite work on these roads.\n\nAbout the overbilling and extra charges on gas in Balochistan, the NA body issues directives for early redressal of the issue. SSGC officials told the committee that on the court direction, a special tariff was charged in the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
