The team was selected by the esteemed members of the commentary team,” the PCB announced on Monday.\n\n“Shaheen, not only claimed the Fazal Mahmood Cap for finishing as the highest wicket-taker – 19 dismissals in 13 matches, but also leads a team that features two of his Qalandars team-mates. Sikandar Raza (11 matches, 254 runs, 10 wickets) and Fakhar Zaman (13 matches, 439 runs) earned their places on the back of stellar performances in the tournament,” the PCB added.\n\nQuetta Gladiators – the runners-up of this year’s PSL — are also represented in the PSL X team by three players. They include Hasan Nawaz, who was also adjudged best batter of the tournament (12 matches, 399 runs), all-rounder Faheem Ashraf (12 matches, 163 runs, 17 wickets) and mystery spinner Abrar Ahmed (12 matches, 17 wickets).\n\nKarachi Kings’ captain David Warner (11 games, 368 runs) along with team-mates James Vince (11 matches, 378) and pacer Hasan Ali (10 matches, 17 wickets) are also part of PSL X team. Their team-mate Khushdil Shah (11 matches, 253 runs, seven wickets) is the 12th man.\n\nIslamabad United’s Sahibzada Farhan, who earned the Hanif Mohammad Cap for leading the run charts with 449 runs in 12 matches, is the sole representative from his side.\n\nCompleting the line-up is Pesha­war Zalmi’s fast bowler Ali Raza, who took 12 wickets in nine matches.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
