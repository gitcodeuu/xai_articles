They will also organise arts and posters as well as national songs competitions.\n\nThe competitions will be held at the district level in all public schools across Punjab. The top winner of each category at the district level will be awarded a prize of Rs50,000.\n\nThe department has urged all schools to participate in these activities and competitions to celebrate the day.\n\n“Students and staff will make a pledge to work for the betterment, peace, and scientific progress of Pakistan,” it added.\n\nAt the conclusion of the ceremony, summer vacations shall be declared.",
