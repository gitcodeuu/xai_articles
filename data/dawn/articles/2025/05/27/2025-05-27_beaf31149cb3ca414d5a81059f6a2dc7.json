This also suggests higher capacity utilisation of local oil refineries compared to last year, which increased their profitability. The surging crude oil imports also translated into higher petroleum product production by local refineries.\n\nThe PBS data showed that the output of all 11 petroleum products was higher by 4.48pc than last year. Further analysis showed that the local production of high-speed diesel mostly used in the transport sector and agriculture — was up 9.32pc. However, petroleum production showed a paltry growth of 1.97pc during the period under review.\n\nThe production of furnace oil was up by almost 2.73pc during 10MFY25 from a year ago. This is a major revival in the production of furnace oil.\n\nConsequently, exports of petroleum products were up by 106.63pc on a year-on-year basis in 10MFY25 to $410.49m. The details show that growth was recorded in almost all petroleum products, including petroleum crude.\n\nThe export of petroleum crude surged to 40,552 tonnes in 10MFY25 against no exports in the corresponding period last year. Similarly, the exports of petroleum products, excluding top naphtha, grew 103pc to 888,737 tonnes in 10MFY25 against 437,687 tonnes last year. The export of petroleum top naphtha also surged 105pc to 82,266 tonnes year-on-year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 27th, 2025",
