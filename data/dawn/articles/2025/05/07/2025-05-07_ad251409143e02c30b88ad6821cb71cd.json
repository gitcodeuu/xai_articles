Baker, said on Tuesday that the resumption of US soybean exports to Pakistan signifies the growing partnership between the two countries.\n\nMs Natalie accompanied the delegation of the US Chamber of Commerce and the US-Pakistan Business Council (USPBC), which met Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan.\n\nSenior Vice President Charles Freeman led the delegation.\n\nAn official announcement said that Ms Natalie emphasised that the renewed trade underscores the ability of both countries to find pragmatic solutions for enhancing agricultural cooperation and diversifying trade.\n\nShe appreciated positive developments in agricultural trade, such as the resumption of soybean exports from the US to Pakistan, demonstrating the strength of the partnership and the ability to find practical solutions and encouraging avenues for deeper agricultural cooperation and trade diversification.\n\nShe further said that enhanced cooperation in the cotton sector is also a key area for mutual growth, given Pakistan’s textile industry’s demand for high-quality cotton and the US’s position to meet this demand.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that US President Donald Trump has recently imposed enhanced tariffs on Pakistan and demanded reciprocal market access for US products such as soybean, cotton, etc.\n\nAccording to the announcement, Pakistan and the US are pleased to strengthen their long-standing strategic and economic partnership, which has been marked by recent high-level engagements and a mutual commitment to enhancing trade and investment linkages.\n\nMr Kamal stated that the visit would further cement economic relations between the two countries and appreciated the role of USPBC over the past two decades in advancing US commercial engagements with Pakistan, actively working to increase trade and investment flows and creating opportunities for businesses in both nations.\n\nHe said that Pakistan values the US as its largest export destination and deeply appreciates this strategic trade relationship. Efforts are underway to address trade deficit and market access issues through a comprehensive strategy involving relevant stakeholders.\n\nThe minister said the recent 90-day pause in reciprocal tariffs is seen as a significant opportunity for constructive engagement and building a sustainable, mutually beneficial roadmap.\n\nHe assured that Pakistan is committed to creating a predictable and conducive trade environment for US businesses and investors, upholding transparent, rules-based, and fair-trade practices. The government of Pakistan is dedicated to establishing the best working relationship with the United States, particularly in trade and investment, to ensure progress on bilateral and multilateral levels.\n\nCharles Freeman appreciated the warmth of the Government of Pakistan, which is fully committed to facilitating businesses and looks forward to continued dialogue and technical cooperation to support economic growth and job creation in both countries.\n\nThe visit of the US-Pakistan Business Council delegation from May 5-7 serves as a valuable platform for dialogue, partnership-building, and opportunity creation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 7th, 2025",
