Two of them fell in occupied Kashmir and one in India’s Bathinda.\n\nTwo drones were also taken down, the prime minister said. “This is conventional warfare […] and those who used to say India has left Pakistan behind in conventional warfare … they now know what we are, whether it is nuclear warfare or conventional.”\n\n“Our enemies were unable to sleep last night and our friends have realised that they can approach Pakistan for help whenever they may be in a tough time and there is nothing more respectful for Pakistan than this,” PM Shehbaz added.",
