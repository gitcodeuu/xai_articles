  "content": "Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar has said India’s actions following the Pahalgam attack, and including last night’s airstrikes, look like a “choreographed exercise”.\n\n“But time will tell what the reality is,” he said. The minister recalled that Pakistan received intel on a possible attack from India at around 10pm yesterday. “I want to clarify that Pakistan has exercised restraint even at the moment.\n\n“There were instructions to only attack Indian jets that released a payload … this is why only five jets were taken down, if the direction had been otherwise, nearly 10-12 jets would have been struck down,” Dar said.",
