  "content": "KHYBER: Authorities at Torkham have made it obligatory for Afghan transporters to produce valid visa for entering Pakistan after May 30 as the one-year period of Temporary Admission Document (TAD) will expire on the same date.\n\nOfficials said that posters regarding the expiry of TAD and implementation of ‘one document regime’ (valid visa on passport) were displayed at prominent places at Torkham border and Afghan transporters were also informed verbally that they would be allowed to enter Pakistan only if they had a valid visa on passport.\n\nThey said that the ‘one document regime’ referred to Pakistan’s policy that required Afghan citizens to use a valid visa and passport for entry, exit and stay in the country.\n\nThey said that the policy replaced the previous practice of allowing some individuals with special travel permits, especially those with tribal connections across the border, to enter Pakistan without standard documentation.\n\nOfficials said that in order to regulate bilateral trade between the two neighbouring countries, special relaxation was granted to transporters of both the countries to navigate on both sides on the border while carrying and bringing trade cargoes.\n\nThey said that most of the transporters from both sides were either without passports or were not in a position to timely obtain such necessary documents owing to financial constraints.\n\nHowever, the two countries through their ministries of commerce agreed to introduce Temporary Admission Document (TAD) mechanism, effective from May 1, 2024 for transporters of both the countries to temporarily provide a legal relief to drivers and their assistants, who were mostly without legal travel documents.\n\nThis initiative was meant to streamline and regulate movement of cargo vehicles engaged in bilateral trade between the two countries, enhancing efficiency and oversight.\n\nHowever, officials at Torkham now insisted that the arrangement or facility would be withdrawn as the one year period was nearing expiry.\n\nMeanwhile, a delegation of local traders and transporters called on the Afghan consul general in Peshawar, Hafiz Muhidullah, and informed him about the situation that aroused after the official declaration about repeal of TAD by the end of May.\n\nLed by Haji Nazeemgul Shinwari, the delegation informed the Afghan diplomat about the hardships they would face once after the TAD facility was withdrawn and demanded of him to take up the matter with Pakistani authorities for any possible leniency.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 7th, 2025",
