He announced a “Mil­lion March” to be held in Pe­­shawar on May 11 and another in Quetta on May 15 to demonstrate public solidarity.\n\nHe said his party had entru­sted civil defence registration responsibility to its Ansarul Islam force. “Today, the youth from religious seminaries are standing at the frontlines beside our armed forces for the defence of Pakistan,” he said.\n\nHe urged the government to address concerns regarding a madressah registration bill.\n\n“This confrontation should be brought to an end. … I am standing with you in national interest. You will also have to stand with me,” Mr Rehman said.\n\nHe also urged the government to engage countries such as China, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan and Turkiye amid tensions.\n\n“India has launched rocket attacks on mosques, seminaries, and civilian areas,” he said. “Our brothers and sisters have been martyred. Pakistan’s military has responded bravely and with remarkable strategy.”\n\nMr Rehman criticised certain social media users, saying, “Some individuals are treating this war like a joke online. They mock our armed forces.” He called on the government to “take steps to discourage this practice” and urged for a “uniform narrative.”\n\nDefence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif declared that the armed forces “are fully prepared to deal with the situation arising out of the Indian aggression.”\n\n“They are valiantly fighting on the Line of Control and the working boundary,” Mr Asif said. He said India’s “designs were successfully thwarted, which has demoralised their people, media and political parties.”\n\nOn diplomatic efforts, Mr Asif said, “We are in contact with China and the Gulf countries on a daily basis.”\n\nMinister for Railways Hanif Abbasi labelled India “the biggest terrorist in the world,” claiming that Pakistan has presented dossiers on India’s alleged involvement in terrorism inside Pakistan and in assassinations abroad. “The entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces for defence of the homeland,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, around a dozen lawmakers backed by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) called for the release of party founder Imran Khan in the interest of national unity.\n\nFormer National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said the PTI had “set aside its differences, but the government should also play its part in promoting national unity.”\n\nMr Qaiser criticised a Supreme Court decision allowing military trials for civilians as “against the Constitution” and decried the ongoing “crackdown on PTI workers.”\n\nHe demanded that Mr Khan be released and “baseless cases against him be withdrawn.” Other PTI lawmakers echoed the demand and said Mr Khan’s call could bring millions to the streets as a show of resolve to India.\n\nSome lawmakers also criticised former premier Nawaz Sharif, Maryam Nawaz and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for not explicitly naming Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in their remarks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 10th, 2025",
