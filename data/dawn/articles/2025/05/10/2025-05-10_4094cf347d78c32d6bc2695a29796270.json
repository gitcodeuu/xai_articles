  "content": "The DG ISPR has said that India has fired “six ballistic missiles from Adampur” with one targeting “their own general area of Adampur and five have targeted the Indian Punjab general area of Amritsar”.\n\nAdampur is a town in the Jalandhar district of Indian Punjab.\n\n“India is targeting through its schemes, populations of Sikhs in Indian Punjab. All our sympathies are with Sikhs and minorities who are falling victim to its (India’s) own internal conspiracies.\n\n“This is a shocking development and provocation of the highest order, where India has now started firing ballistic missiles at its own population, which doesn’t make any sort of sense. This is an act bereft of sanity.”",
