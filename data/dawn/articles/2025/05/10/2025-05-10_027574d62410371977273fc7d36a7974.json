It’s for the individual franchises to decide what they want to do with their foreign recruits.”\n\nThe tenth edition of the PSL involved 37 foreign players including from England, Australia, New Zealand, the West Indies and South Africa.\n\nMost foreign players wanted to leave Pakistan after a drone fell adjacent to Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium, where Thursday’s match was cancelled.\n\nThe top-notch players included former Australian opener David Warner, former West Indian skipper Jason Holder and New Zealand’s current white-ball captain Michael Bracewell.\n\nThere were eight matches remaining in the PSL, including play-offs and the final, scheduled for May 18.\n\nThe PCB also said the safety of players was paramount.\n\n“We, at the PCB, also have sincere regard for the mental well-being of participating players and the sentiments of our foreign players, and we respect the concerns of their families who want to see them back home.”\n\nEarlier, a statement from PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi said that the board had decided to shift the remaining matches to the UAE so that the domestic as well as foreign cricketers could be saved from “the possible reckless targeting by India”.\n\nHowever, the decision to postpone the league came hours later, on Friday.\n\nCricket Australia was said to be closely observing the tense situation, with more than two dozen players and coaches involved in the IPL and the PSL.\n\n“We continue to closely monitor the situation in Pakistan and India, including obtaining regular advice and updates from the Australian Government, the PCB, BCCI and local government authorities, and maintaining communication with our players and support staff currently in the region,” CA said in a statement on Friday morning.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 10th, 2025",
