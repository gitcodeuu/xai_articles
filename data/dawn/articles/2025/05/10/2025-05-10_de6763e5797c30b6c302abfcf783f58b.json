Therefore, it [the issue] must be resolved once and for all,” he said and also directed the KWSC to ensure proper water supply from today.\n\nA statement issued from the CM House said that the the meeting was attended among others by Energy Minister Nasir Shah, Local Government Minister Saeed Ghani, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah and other senior officials.\n\nThe chief minister expressed dissatisfaction on the condition of distribution network of the water utility and directed the water board to conduct a comprehensive survey of all old lines and develop a five-year plan for their repair/replacement.\n\n“The water utility needs to stren­gthen its system,” he declared.\n\nThe rupture in the 84-inch main siphon at the university had wreaked havoc on the campus and adjoining housing societies, flooding a vast area. The water utility chief had said that the pipelines’ design life had come to an end since it was laid in 1956.\n\nAsks stakeholders to remove bottlenecks in K-IV completion\n\nReviewing the progress on the Greater Karachi Bulk Water Supply Scheme (K-IV Augme­ntation Works, KWSSIP-II), the chief minister urged all relevant agencies to remove administrative bottlenecks immediately.\n\nHe directed the LG department to expedite the tendering process and secure all necessary No Objection Certificates (NOCs) to ensure that physical work on the Rs71.8 billion K-IV Augmentation Project begins within the next three months.\n\nThe K-IV Augmentation Project is being implemented by the LG department with financial support from the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), the World Bank and the Sindh government.\n\nThe project comprises multiple packages, including Package A: Water transmission main from Reservoir 1 to Y-Junction. Package B1: Transmission from Reservoir R2 to Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology (FUUAST). Package B2: From FUUAST to Gul Bai, and Package C: From R3 to Banaras, and a 2.7 km common corridor shared with the Karachi Bus Rapid Transit (KBRT) system.\n\nThe project’s design was finalised and reviewed by an international Austrian firm, in line with Planning Commission directives. Bid documents were prepared and are being updated by the supervision consultant.\n\nThe process for hiring a Construction Supervision Consultant (CSC) has already begun. The Technical and Financial Proposals’ Technical Evaluation Report (TER) was approved by the World Bank.\n\nTo facilitate the project, 18 different agencies were approached for NOCS. So far, NOCs have been secured from seven agencies.\n\nThe chief minister reiterated his commitment to accelerating the delivery of the K-IV Augmentation Project to ensure equitable access to clean drinking water for Karachi’s growing population.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 10th, 2025",
