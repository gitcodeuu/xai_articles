Ahead of the decision, Indian officials had raised objections, alleging misuse of global funds by Pakistan — claims that Islam­abad has consistently rejected as politically motivated.\n\nIndia’s Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri stated on Thursday that New Delhi had instructed its representative at the IMF to raise concerns over Pakistan’s eligibility for international financing. He also called on international institutions, including the World Bank and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to reassess Pakistan’s status.\n\nProgress in restoring stability\n\nFollowing the board discussion, Deputy Managing Director Nigel Clarke said in a statement that Pakistan had made important progress in restoring macroeconomic stability despite a challenging environment.\n\n“Since the approval of the EFF, the economy continues to recover, with inflation sharply lower and external buffers notably stronger. Risks to the outlook remain elevated, however, particularly from global economic policy uncertainty, rising geopolitical tensions, and persistent domestic vulnerabilities.”\n\nHe said the steadfast implementation of the FY2025 budget and the passage of key fiscal reforms, notably the Agricultural Income Tax, underpinned the process of rebuilding policy making credibility.\n\n“Continuing to mobilise greater revenue from undertaxed sectors and the noncompliant will make the tax system more equitable and efficient. This, combined with federal and provincial spending discipline, will strengthen sustainability, build resilience, and reduce the public sector’s crowding out of private credit.”\n\nAccording to the IMF official’s statement, the timely implementation of power tariff adjustments had helped reduce the stock and flow of circular debt. “Meanwhile, cost-side reforms are showing early signs of success but need to be accelerated to safeguard the energy sector’s viability and improve Pakistan’s competitiveness.”\n\nHe also credited the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) tight monetary policy stance as being pivotal in reducing inflation to historic lows. “Monetary policy should remain appropriately tight and data-dependent to ensure inflation is anchored within the SBP’s target range. A more flexible exchange rate will facilitate the adjustment to external and domestic shocks, aiding the rebuilding of reserves.”\n\nHe also called for prompt action to address undercapitalised financial institutions and extolled vigilance over the financial sector are necessary for financial stability.\n\n“Accelerating structural reforms will unlock Pakistan’s competitiveness, creating conditions to attract high-impact private investment. Reform priorities include reducing trade and investment barriers, advancing SOE reforms, and decisively strengthening governance and anti-corruption institutions.\n\nOn the new RSF, Mr Clarke said it would help reduce Pakistan’s vulnerability to extreme weather events, and enhance macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability.\n\n“The reforms under the RSF aim to build resilience to natural disasters by strengthening public investment processes, supporting efficient use of scarce water resources, strengthening coordination of natural disaster response and financing, improving the information on climate-related risks, and supporting Pakistan in meeting its international commitments.”\n\nPM lauds economic team\n\nMeanwhile, PM Shehbaz Sharif expressed satisfaction over the IMF approval of the $1bn tranche for Pakistan, slamming India for what he described as failed underhanded tactics to sabotage the programme, APP reported.\n\nIn a statement issued by the PM Office, Shehbaz Sharif lauded Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Finance Secretary Imdadullah Bosal and the entire economic team for their role in securing the crucial IMF support.\n\nIndia’s desperate moves to sabotage the IMF programme have failed, he said, adding that international financial institutions have rejected India’s false narrative. The prime minister emphasised that the approved IMF tranche would help stabilise the country’s economy and guide it towards long-term recovery.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 10th, 2025",
