  "content": "ISLAMABAD: After securing a quota to harvest 25,000 tonnes of tuna fish from the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC), Pakistan is preparing to introduce a comprehensive National Fisheries Policy, and consultations with relevant stakeholders have begun.\n\nMaritime Affairs Minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry said on Friday that the country had obtained a quota to catch 25,000 tonnes of tuna from the Indian Ocean, which is expected to increase fish exports and enhance Pakistan’s presence in international seafood markets.\n\nThe quota is established by the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission, which operates under the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations. Its purpose is to promote cooperation among member countries in managing, conserving, and optimally utilising fish and seafood stocks. Additionally, it aims to encourage the sustainable development of fisheries based on these resources.\n\n“We are also working to strengthen aquaculture, an area with vast potential, and it is expected to contribute $200 million in the next two years,” said the minister in a meeting with the Fisheries Development Commissioner Mian Aftab Ali.\n\nGovt secures 25,000-tonne quota to harvest tuna\n\nIt was noted that a Fisheries Development Fund should be formed to provide financial stability and promote innovation across the sector.\n\nThe Fisheries Development Commission has stressed the need to modernise infrastructure and technological support to harness aquaculture’s capabilities in the country, and for that purpose, incentive packages for the fishing industry will be announced soon.\n\nThis includes support for fishing vessels, aquaculture equipment, and value-added seafood products, and the Ministry of Maritime Affairs has finalised plans to revitalize the Korangi Fisheries Harbour Authority (KHFA).\n\nWhile inland and coastal fishing was the domain of the provinces, the KFHA is a federal government entity.\n\nThe minister reaffirmed the government’s resolve to create a policy framework that supports the fishing community and ensures environmental sustainability, export diversification, and economic resilience.\n\nThe meeting underscored the ministry’s renewed commitment to revitalising and modernising Pakistan’s marine economy and a series of consultative workshops to be held in major cities of the country, including Karachi, Peshawar, Lahore and Islamabad next month to attract investments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 10th, 2025",
