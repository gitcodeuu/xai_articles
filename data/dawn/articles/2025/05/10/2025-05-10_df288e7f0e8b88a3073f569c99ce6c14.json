Locals said Mr Khalid had returned from Libya barely a week ago for a vacation.\n\nApart from the casualties, numerous homes and public-sector buildings — including healthcare facilities — were also damaged in the cross-LoC shelling.\n\nAll educational institutions in the region remained closed on Friday. The prime minister said a review of school reopening and board examinations would be undertaken on Monday.\n\n“People are not willing to leave their homes, which reflects their extraordinary courage,” the premier said. “We had to forcibly evacuate them for their own safety.”\n\nMeanwhile, on Friday, the government announced the suspension of weekend holidays in all departments classified as essential services under the AJK Essential Services (Maintenance) Act, 2016.\n\nAccording to a statement by the State Disaster Management Authority, at least 17 lives have been lost 53 people injured in AJK since Tuesday night due to missile attacks and shelling along the LoC.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of the LoC, artillery fire destroyed or damaged dozens of homes in Uri, forcing many to flee to safer areas in towns like Baramulla.\n\nSajjad Shafi, a local lawmaker, told AFP that about 10 per cent of Uri’s population — some 22,000 people — fled since the latest fighting began.\n\nOn Friday, many more were fleeing in buses and trucks provided by the government or driving off in their own cars.\n\n“How can we stay here?” Rubina Begum said outside her destroyed home. “The government should lodge us somewhere safe”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 10th, 2025",
