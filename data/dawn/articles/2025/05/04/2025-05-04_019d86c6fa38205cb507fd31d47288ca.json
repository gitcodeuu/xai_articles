  "content": "SWAT: Traders observed a shutter-down strike and held a demonstration on the Qambar Bypass here on Saturday against the government’s decision to relocate the Mingora General Bus Stand back into the city centre.\n\nThe protesters raised slogans against the government and demanded an immediate reversal of the decision. They carried placards inscribed with slogans in support of their demands.\n\nBabuzai additional assistant commissioner Tariq Khan held negotiations with the protesters, after which they agreed to give the authorities until Monday to respond.\n\nLater, addressing a press conference, president of Malakand Division Traders’ Federation Abdul Rahim, president of Qambar Bypass Traders’ Union Bakhtzeb Khan, trade leader Haji Mudasir, and local government representatives Shoaib Khan, Qambar Riaz Khan, and Bakht Munir criticised the decision.\n\nSay move to cost them ‘substantial’ investment\n\nThey stated that the government had only a few years ago moved the bus terminal from the city centre to the bypass, prompting substantial investments by traders in the new location. Reversing the decision now, they said was not only unjust but also a clear indication of administrative incompetence.\n\nThe leaders warned that any attempt by the authorities to enforce the relocation forcibly would be met with hunger strikes and a complete closure of the Qambar Bypass.\n\n“We do not wish to harm anyone, but we will certainly defend our legitimate rights,” warned Abdul Rahim.\n\nIn a separate development, office-bearers of Swat Chamber of Commerce and Industry met Malakand Division Traders’ Federation president Abdul Rahim on Saturday to take a united stand against the government’s move to impose taxes in the region.\n\nBoth parties agreed to launch a joint movement against the planned taxation and decided to convene a meeting of the business community in the coming days.\n\nSwat chamber delegation was led by Yusuf Ali.\n\nThe chamber’s representatives informed Mr Rahim that the current tax exemption was due to expire on June 30, 2025.\n\nThey stressed the need for a united effort to resist the re-imposition of taxes.\n\nWOMEN RIGHTS: Speakers at a meeting on Saturday stressed the urgent need for concrete steps to safeguard women’s rights.\n\nIt was organised by EVA-G Alliance, a platform of various civil society organisations. The alliance brought together local stakeholders to discuss the growing concerns of women in the region.\n\n“Protecting women’s rights requires more than rhetoric – it demands action,” said Samreen Hakeem Advocate. She emphasised that systemic support must be institutionalised to ensure women feel safe and empowered.\n\nAnother speaker, Dr Yasmeen Gul underscored the critical role of education in addressing the challenges women face. “Without access to education, women cannot be expected to overcome the barriers they encounter daily,” she noted.\n\n“We intend to increase collaboration with government departments to find lasting solutions to these problems,” said a speaker.\n\nA key outcome of the meeting was the decision to form a special committee to provide immediate assistance to women in distress and identify other pressing social issues.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 4th, 2025",
