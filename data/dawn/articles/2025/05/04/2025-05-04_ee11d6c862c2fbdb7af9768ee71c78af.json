The areas included Clifton, Saddar, Burns Road, old city areas, Nazimabad, North Nazimabad, Federal B Area, Gulshan Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Korangi, Shah Faisal, SITE, Keamari and Malir.\n\nThe district-wise report of the samples, available with Dawn, said that only 10 per cent sample were found adulterated with added water and did not have any other adulterants.\n\nAccording to the district-wise break-up of the collected samples, he said that as many as 43 samples of milk were taken from as many shops in district South and 19 of them were found adulterated.\n\nNine out of 16 samples collected in Korangi were detected adulterated, 10 out of 20 in Malir, five out of 16 in East, six out of 13 in Keamari, three out of seven in West and two out of 12 samples in district Central.\n\nAlarmingly, all 110 samples of tea leaves in seven districts were found adulterated with polyphenols.\n\nOf them, 43 were taken in district South, 16 in Korangi, three in West, 13 in Keamari, 16 each in East and Malir and three in district Central.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 4th, 2025",
