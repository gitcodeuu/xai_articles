  "content": "ISLAMABAD: President Asif Ali Zardari has summoned the session of the National Assembly tomorrow (Monday).\n\n“The president has summoned the National Assembly session to meet at the Parliament House on Monday (May 5) at 5pm under Article 54(1) of the Constitution,” says a statement issued by the National Assembly Secretariat here on Saturday.\n\nDuring the upcoming session, the members of the lower house are expected to have a debate on the prevailing India-Pakistan tensions in the aftermath of the last month’s terrorists attack in Pahalgam in India-held Kashmir and the New Delhi’s unilateral announcement to hold the 65-year-old Indus Water Treaty in abeyance.\n\nThe National Assembly is also expected to pass a resolution on the current situation in the region.\n\nEarlier, the Senate on April 25 had unanimously adopted a resolution, pledging a firm and decisive response to any misadventure by India, following escalating tensions after the Pahalgam attack and New Delhi’s attempts to link Pakistan to the incident.\n\nThe upper house had condemned India’s “unlawful and unilateral” decision to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, describing the move as a blatant violation and tantamount to an act of war.\n\nThe resolution had stressed that Pakistan remained fully capable and prepared to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity against any aggression, including “water terrorism” or military provocation — citing Pakistan’s robust response to Indian actions in February 2019 as evidence of its readiness.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 4th, 2025",
