This would have had an impact on over 2m people,” posted the LadyGagaFansTogether Instagram account, which has 307,000 followers.\n\nWriting on the same account, one fan said he was “scared sick about her (Gaga) being safe at all times”.\n\nThe gig was part of a strategy by Rio to hold mega-concerts in May in an effort to boost tourism during what is considered the low season.\n\nAll week, Gaga fans had flocked to Rio, a city famous for its annual Carnival that attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world.\n\nMayor Eduardo Paes has also hinted that he plans to bring in Irish rock band U2, although no date has been given.\n\nLady Gaga had kicked off her show perched more than two metres (6.5 feet) above the stage in a massive scarlet hoop gown which opened to reveal a vertical cage from which her dancers exited to a rendition of her 2011 song “Bloody Mary”.\n\n“Brazil, I missed you so much,” screamed the popstar, who performed several tracks from her latest album, “Mayhem”, as well as favourites from throughout her career.",
