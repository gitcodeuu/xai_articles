The failure of the Parliament to do so has emboldened the FIA to get away with torturing and humiliating journalists with total impunity. This situation, he said, could not and must not be allowed to persist.\n\nThe PPP Human Rights Cell also expresses deep concern over the weakening of the economic model of media undermining press freedoms.\n\nIt also strongly condemns the blatant advertising restrictions on some media outlets by the government who refuse to peddle the “official truth and official narrative.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 4th, 2025",
