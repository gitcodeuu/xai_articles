  "content": "SAN FRANCISCO: Apple on Friday relaxed its App Store payment rules in the face of a scathing court order, with Spotify quick to reap the benefit.\n\nApple’s update to its App Store guidelines let developers know they could now provide links to outside payment platforms, allowing people to buy apps featured in its US online shop without paying through the App Store.\n\nThe rule change came just two days after a US judge accused Apple of defying an order to loosen its grip on the App Store payment system to the point that criminal charges could be warranted.\n\nUS District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple “willfully” violated an injunction she issued at trial, with the company instead creating new barriers to competition with the App Store and even lying to the court in the process.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson told AFP that it strongly disagrees with the judge’s decision and will appeal to a higher court, but would comply.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 4th, 2025",
