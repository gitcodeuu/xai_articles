This was only marginally one point lower than 2022 — the last year of PTI’s government — when Pakistan ranked 157th.\n\nMr Akram alleged the current government has imposed “strict restrictions” on digital and social media.\n\nHe said pro-PTI YouTube channels and X accounts were being shut down while “journalists who speak the truth” were either being forced to leave the country or removed from their jobs.\n\nThe PTI leader questioned why senior journalists were being targeted for disagreeing with the government’s narrative and why despite court orders, there was an “undeclared ban on covering PTI or even mentioning Imran Khan’s name” on TV? He also demanded the restoration of X in Pakistan.\n\nRTI law for GB\n\nIn Gilgit-Baltistan, government and opposition lawmakers highlighted the challenges faced by journalists in the region and called for the Right of Access to Information (RTI) law.\n\nAt an event held at the Central Press Club Gilgit in connection with the World Press Freedom Day on Saturday, GB Assembly Speaker Nazir Ahmed said the assembly will play its role in formulating laws to facilitate journalists.\n\n“The Right to Information Act submitted in the GB Assembly will be approved after necessary amendments.”\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, the president of PPP GB chapter, Amjad Hussain Advocate, said journalists in the region were facing more challenges than their counterparts in other parts of the country.\n\nSpecial Assistant to GB Chief Minister on Information Iman Shah said the approval of the proposed media and digital media policy was being deliberately delayed. He said Federal Minister for Information Attaullah Tarrar has assured of steps for the betterment of the media industry and journalists.\n\nMember of the Assembly and Chairman of the Standing Committee on Information Javed Manwa said the RTI Act has been submitted to the assembly, but no progress has been made on it yet.\n\nHe clarified that without the legislation, there will be risks of disinformation and misinformation.\n\nRepresentatives of journalists’ bodies also spoke about their issues. They said the RTI Act needed to be implemented after approval from the assembly.\n\nThey said the GB government was using advertisements “as a weapon to suppress the voice of journalists and media houses” in the region.\n\nLater, journalists took a rally from the Central Press Club to Chinarbagh to demand in favour of their demands.\n\nSeparately, the newly elected Central Press Club Gilgit cabinet members also took their oath on Saturday.\n\nSpeaker Ahmed administered the oath to newly elected President Tahir Rana, General Secretary Wajahat Ali, Senior Vice President Imtiaz Ali Sultan, Vice President Saadat Ali, Finance Secretary Nadeem Khan and Joint Secretary Syed Sher Abbas.\n\nJamil Nagri in Gilgit also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 4th, 2025",
