Later, the bodies were handed over to the grieving families. Prayers were also offered for the departed souls.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Hussain expressed deep sorrow and grief and expressed solidarity with the bereaved families.\n\nHe said, “We are making strict laws against those who play with the lives of people. Some culprits had been arrested while the rest have yet to be caught.”\n\nLast month, the bodies of six people who died in the boat tragedy arrived in three districts of the Gujranwala division. The victims whose bodies arrived included a couple belonging to Sialkot.\n\nThe Federal Investigation Agency, Gujranwala Zone, also launched at least three different inquiries into the death of the Pakistani nationals in the boat capsizing.",
