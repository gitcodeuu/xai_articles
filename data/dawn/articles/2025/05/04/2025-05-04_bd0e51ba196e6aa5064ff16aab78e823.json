Residents have been advised to avoid being in open areas to minimise risks,” the report read.\n\n“The PDMA recommends that citizens follow disaster management plans and guidelines. Citizens are encouraged to stay alert and follow PDMA’s advisories to stay safe.”\n\nOn Friday, the PDMA announced that two people had died and 24 others were injured due to windstorms and rain in different cities of Punjab.\n\nIn the event of a disaster, citizens have been advised to call 1129 for assistance.",
