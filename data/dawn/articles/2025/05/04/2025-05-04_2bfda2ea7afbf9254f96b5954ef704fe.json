Any malicious intent aimed at the sovereignty and security of Pakistan will not be tolerated,” he said.\n\n“Our martyrs are the true heroes of the nation. They have protected every inch of this sacred land with their blood. It is our duty as citizens to stand firmly behind them and send a message to the world that Pakistani people and armed forces are one,” he added.\n\nHe said that India’s repeated violations of international norms and its hostile posture towards Pakistan reflect a dangerous mindset that threatens peace in the region.\n\n“The world must take notice of India’s warmongering. Its irresponsible leadership continues to undermine regional stability, but we want to make it clear — Pakistan is not weak. We are a nuclear nation with one of the world’s most battle-hardened armies, and our patience should never be mistaken for weakness,” said Mr Siddiqui.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 4th, 2025",
