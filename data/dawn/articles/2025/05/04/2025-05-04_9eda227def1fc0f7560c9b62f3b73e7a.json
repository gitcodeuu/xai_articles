Fox Airfield in Los Angeles County and was heading to Camarillo Airport in neighboring Ventura County.\n\nIn January, a Van’s RV-10, a small plane with four seats, crashed into a commercial building near Fullerton Municipal Airport southeast of Los Angeles, killing at least two people and injuring 18 others.",
