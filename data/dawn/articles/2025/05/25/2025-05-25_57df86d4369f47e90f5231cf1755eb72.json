  "content": "PARIS: French taxi drivers will next week step up protest actions, including paralysing access to Paris airports and the French Open tennis championship, in an increasingly acrimonious standoff with the government, their main federation said on Saturday.\n\nTaxi drivers have over the last week blocked roads in a row with the government about payments for transporting patients which for many cab drivers form a major part of their businesses. Meanwhile grievances against ride-hailing services such as Uber and Bolt have been aired again, with taxi drivers seeing them as a threat to their livelihood.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
