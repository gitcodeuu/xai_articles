The issue was resolved “amicably” the same day.\n\nMeanwhile, people in the Sultankhel area of Landi Kotal blocked the main road to Torkham against the parking of a large number of loaded vehicles on both sides of the road.\n\nThe Sultankhel protesters accused the local police for their failure to regulate traffic on the main road.\n\nThey also alleged that the police took bribes from transporters for allowing them to proceed to Torkham out of turn.\n\nPolice officials, however, insisted that the congestion of the main road was a result of the suspension of goods clearance at Torkham due to a fault in the scanning machine and they would clear the road once the scanning machines were repaired.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
