  "content": "DUBAI: The United Arab Emirates breached its May temperature record for the second day in a row, hitting 51.6 degrees Celsius on Saturday, within touching distance of the highest ever temperature recorded in the country.\n\n“The highest temperature recorded over the country today is 51.6C in Sweihan (Al Ain) at 1345 UAE local time (0945 GMT),” the National Centre of Meteorology said in a post on X, just 0.4°C off the overall heat record in the Gulf country.\n\nThe meteorology office said the highest ever temperature recorded in the UAE since documentation began in 2003 was reported at 52°C on Abu Dhabi’s Al Yasat island in 2010.\n\nThe desert nation, a top global oil exporter, lies in one of the planet’s hottest regions and one which is particularly vulnerable to climate change.\n\nThe temperature in Sweihan — which lies 97km west of Abu Dhabi — and of 50.4°C a day earlier in the Emirati capital exceeded the previous record for May of 50.2°C recorded in 2009, according to the meteorology office.\n\nOn Saturday in Dubai, where high temperatures in the mid-40 degrees Celsius were recorded, motorists complained air conditioning in their cars was struggling to stifle the sweltering heat, surprised the phenomenon had hit so early in the year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
