When he offered resistance, the intruders opened fire, killing him on the spot.\n\nThe killers fled the scene and could not be arrested till late into the night.\n\nPolice have launched an investigation into the incident.\n\nAccording to police officials, Mr Baloch was also working in the Levies force department.\n\nThey said that a few years ago, the body of Mr Baloch’s kidnapped son was found in Mashkey.\n\nJournalist organisations strongly condemned the killing of Mr Baloch, who was working for Daily Intikhab.\n\nWhile the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) expressed its deepest shock and outrage over the brutal killing, the Balochistan Union of Journalists (BUJ) termed the incident part of a broader conspiracy to silence independent voices in Balochistan.\n\nPFUJ acting President Khalid Khokhar and Secretary General Arshad Ansari said this senseless act of violence is a stark reminder of the risks journalists face while performing their duties.\n\n“We demand that the authorities take immediate and concrete actions to investigate this crime, identify the perpetrators, and bring them to justice,” they demanded in a statement.\n\nThe PFUJ also called for enhanced security measures to protect journalists and ensure their safety while reporting.\n\nIt condemned the threats Mr Baloch received prior to his murder. Such acts of intimidation create a climate of fear, undermining press freedom and democracy, it added.\n\n“We stand in solidarity with Abdul Latif Baloch’s family, colleagues, and the Baluchistan journalist community, and pledge to continue advocating for journalists’ rights and safety,” they urged\n\nThe PFUJ leadership called upon the government to take concrete steps to address the deteriorating security situation for journalists and media workers across Pakistan.\n\nIn a separate statement, BUJ President Khalil Ahmed and General Secretary Abdul Ghani Kakar described Mr Baloch as a dedicated and honest journalist, adding that his targeted killing raises serious concerns about press freedom in Balochistan. The union demanded a high-level inquiry into the murder.\n\n“Journalists in a sensitive region like Balochistan already face grave threats, and such attacks highlight the government’s failure to ensure their safety,” the statement said. “If immediate action is not taken, this dangerous trend could escalate further.”\n\nThe BUJ urged the Balochistan government to swiftly arrest the perpetrators and ensure that justice is served.\n\nKalbe Ali in Islamabad also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
