Calcium carbide is used in the chemical industry, including for fertiliser production and steelmaking.\n\n“Given the sensitive marine ecosystem along Kerala’s coast, ICG has activated full pollution response preparedness,” the navy said.\n\nThe vessel also contained some 370 tonnes of fuel and oil but while the coast guard had deployed “detection systems”, it said that “so far, no oil spill has been reported”.",
