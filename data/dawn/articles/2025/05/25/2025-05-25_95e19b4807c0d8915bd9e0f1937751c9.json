  "content": "CAIRO: Egypt has flown 71 nationals home from the Libyan capital Tripoli after deadly clashes between rival militias rocked the city earlier this month, the foreign ministry said on Saturday.\n\nFriday’s special flight by flag carrier EgyptAir “enabled the repatriation of 71 Egyptian citizens who had expressed a desire to come home”, the ministry said.\n\nFrom May 12 to 15, the Libyan capital was rocked by fighting between an armed group aligned with the Tripoli-based government and factions it has sought to dismantle.\n\nThe clashes, which saw artillery exchanges in the city centre, killed at least eight people, according to the United Nations.\n\nAlthough relative calm has since returned to the city, the situation remains highly volatile as calls grow for the resignation of Prime Minister Abdulhamid Dbeibah.\n\nTurkey evacuated 82 of its nationals from Tripoli on a similar repatriation flight last week.\n\nLibya is split between the UN-recognised government in Tripoli led by Dbeibah, and a rival administration in the east.\n\nAU calls for ceasefire\n\nThe African Union called for a permanent ceasefire in Libya on Saturday after deadly clashes in the capital and demonstrations demanding the prime minister’s resignation.\n\nDespite a lack of a formal ceasefire, the clashes mostly ended last week, with the Libyan defence ministry saying this week that efforts towards a truce were “ongoing”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
