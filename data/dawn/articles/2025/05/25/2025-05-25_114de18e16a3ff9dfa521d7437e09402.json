Meanwhile, three persons were injured during the windstorm on Kamra Road in Attock.\n\nMeanwhile, the heavy rain accompanied by hailstorm and gusty winds broke the four-day-long heatwave and turned the weather pleasant in Rawalpindi and Islamabad. The Met Office has predicted more rains on Sunday (today).\n\n“Gusty winds were recorded at 105km per hour at Islamabad International Airport and at 80km per hour at Zero Point and adjoining areas,” said the Met Office.\n\nThe Met Office reported 38 millimetres of rain at Zero Point, 3mm at Saidpur, 13mm at Golra, 6mm at Bokra and 5mm at the airport in Islamabad; 36mm at Shamsabad and 20mm rain at Chaklala in Rawalpindi.\n\nThe Met Office said moist currents were penetrating into upper and central parts of the country.\n\nHot and dry weather is expected in most parts of the country, however, rain-duststorm/thundershower is expected at isolated places in Kashmir, Upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Islamabad, Potohar region, northeast Punjab and northeast Balochistan.

Our operation teams immediately responded and restored the electricity.”\n\nFallen trees and signboards at multiple locations damaged power lines and poles, resulting in faults and feeder tripping.\n\n“Iesco’s operations and construction teams were immediately mobilised and restoration activities are underway on an emergency basis.\n\nIesco Chief Executive Muhammad Naeem Jan is personally monitoring all restoration operations from the central control room and is ensuring that field staff are fully supported with necessary resources and instructions to restore electricity as quickly as possible,“ said a statement.\n\n“Our control room near Zero Point has been monitoring the situation.
