However, we have now finalised the demands in accordance with the as­­pirations of the people ac­­ross the entire state, and these will be annou­nced from this stage to­­day,” he told reporters as thous­a­nds of people from across Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) converged on Muzaffarabad to attend the grand rally organised by the Jammu Kashmir Jo­­­int Awami Action\n\nCom­mittee (JKJAAC) — a coalition of civil society gro­ups — to pay tribute to the martyrs of a rights movement.\n\nVehicular caravans adorned with colourful AJK flags began arriving at the city’s historic Upper Adda — popularly refer­red to as Lal Chowk due to its resemblance to Sri­nagar’s iconic square — late in the afternoon, where they were warm-ly welcomed by large crowds from all three districts of Muzaf­farabad division amid thunderous sloganeering.\n\nOrganisers had set up a large stage at the venue, with thousands of chairs arranged for participants.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
