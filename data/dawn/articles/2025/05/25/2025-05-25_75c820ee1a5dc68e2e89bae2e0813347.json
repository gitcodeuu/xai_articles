It includes an art exhibition at the Ahmed Pervez Gallery, theatre plays, musical concerts and panel discussions.\n\nSindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah visited the festival on Saturday. He was warmly received by Arts Council President Muhammad Ahmed Shah.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, CM Shah declared, “Art is our weapon of peace, and our youth are its fearless warriors, so we have to strengthen them further so that they keep performing for peace, and tranquillity.”\n\nHe praised the Arts Council’s role in shaping creative minds and dedicated the festival to the martyrs of Pakistan and the valour of the armed forces, calling it a symbol of national unity and resilience.\n\nCM Murad praises Arts Council for dedicating its Alumni Festival to country’s martyrs and armed forces\n\nMr Shah extended his heartfelt congratulations to the students and the organising administration for the successful commencement of the festival.\n\nHe commended the Arts Council for dedicating the event to Pakistan’s martyrs and the heroic successes of the Pakistan army, calling it a praiseworthy initiative that reflects national unity and pride.\n\n“We are, first and foremost, a nation. Our armed forces are the pride of Pakistan, standing vigilant over every inch of our homeland,” he said.\n\nThe CM paid tribute to the Arts Council for consistently organising exemplary academic, artistic, and literary events.\n\nHe noted that the Arts Alumni Festival 2025 would inspire young students to chart new directions in their creative journeys, through activities including panel discussions, theatre, music, painting exhibitions, and informative workshops.\n\n“Every time I visit the Arts Council, I leave with renewed hope. The energy, innovation, and potential of our youth assure me that the future of Pakistan is in capable hands,” he added.\n\nThe CM also addressed the threats posed by anti-peace forces targeting students and youth. He cited recent tragic incidents, including the terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, which claimed the lives of several innocent students, and an attack on an educational institution in Bahawalpur.\n\nHe strongly condemned these attacks and affirmed the Sindh government’s commitment to bringing those responsible to justice while standing in solidarity with the families of the victims.\n\n“The enemies of peace use guns and explosives, but our students wield the power of the pen and the brush. Through education and art, you must defeat their hateful ideologies,” the CM urged the audience.\n\nMr Shah highlighted that institutions like the Arts Council are not just nurturing creativity but are also building a peaceful identity for Sindh and Pakistan on the global stage.\n\n“We are a nation shaped by art, literature, and culture. Our students are leading in fields like IT and have the skills to disrupt the digital strategies of our enemies,” he remarked.\n\nThe event also featured a poetic recitation by Ambreen Haseeb Ambar. Poets Anwar Shaoor, Fatima Hasan and Farasat Rizvi presented their poetry while singer Muhammad Zubair captivated the audience with his voice.\n\nDay two also included three theatre plays — Azaadi Ek Jung, Monica & A Tale of Two Betrayed, and Salgirah.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
