  "content": "WASHINGTON: The Trump administration issued orders on Friday that it said would effectively lift sanctions on Syria, after President Donald Trump this month pledged to unwind the measures to help the country rebuild after a devastating civil war.\n\nThe Treasury Department issued a general licence that authorises transactions involving the interim Syrian government led by President Ahmed al Sharaa, as well as the central bank and state-owned enterprises.\n\nThe general licence, known as GL25, “authorises transactions prohibited by the Syrian Sanctions Regulations, effectively lifting sanctions on Syria”, the Treasury said in a statement.\n\n“GL25 will enable new investment and private sector activity consistent with the President’s America first strategy,” the statement said.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio also issued a 180-day waiver under the Caesar Act to ensure that sanctions do not obstruct investment and to facilitate the provision of electricity, energy, water and sanitation and enable humanitarian efforts, he said in a statement.\n\n“Today’s actions represent the first step in delivering on the Presidents vision of a new relationship between Syria and the US,” Rubio said, adding that Trump had made clear his expectation sanctions relief would be followed by action by the Syrian government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
