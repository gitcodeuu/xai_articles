He emphasised that the provincial government is committed to resolving transporters’ issues and added that transport is a vital sector and it is the government’s responsibility to ensure its stability.\n\nReferring to the recent unrest, he condemned the arson attacks on vehicles and the loss of lives, calling it a grave criminal act. He disclosed that four drivers were killed during the violence, describing each death as a tragedy affecting entire families.\n\nHe said this is terrorism and that the government will lodge cases under anti-terrorism laws against those responsible. He confirmed that authorities are identifying culprits using CCTV footage and vowed that legal action will be pursued rigorously.\n\nHe warned that no one will be allowed to block roads or engage in lawlessness and declared that those harming public property and safety are not well-wishers of the country but enemies of peace.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 25th, 2025",
