The House celebrated the occasion with Ambas­sadors and High Commissioners of African countries present in the visitor galleries.\n\n“Our peace forces have played a vital role in maintaining peace in Africa — including in Rwanda, Ghana, and Ivory Coast,” Mr Dar said. “We share deep-rooted ties with African nations and support their struggles for independence.”\n\nHe emphasised Pakistan’s eagerness to enhance cooperation in trade and investment, highlighting its offerings in textiles, pharmaceuticals, surgical instruments, sports goods, and IT services. “Pakistan’s digital training programmes align well with Africa’s digital transformation agenda,” he noted, adding that the country has boosted diplomatic presence under its Engage Africa policy.\n\nWelcoming the resolution, PTI Parliamentary Leader Syed Ali Zafar called Africa “a continent of youth, values and vision.” He proposed launching an annual Pakistan-Africa Cultural Festi­val to celebrate shared heritage and showcase music, art, and storytelling.\n\nKhuzdar attack\n\nTurning to national security, Mr Dar condemned the recent Khuzdar attack on children, labelling it an act of terrorism by Indian proxies. “The attack on innocent children was unacceptable. Indian proxies must cease their operations,” he said.\n\nHe urged the formation of a special committee comprising the ministries of Interior, Foreign and Defence to devise a roadmap against terrorism.\n\n“The curse of terrorism must end. The prime minister and military leadership are fully focused on this issue,” he added. Mr Dar noted that most parts of the National Action Plan had already been implemented but emphasised the need for a clear strategy to deal with Indian-backed outfits operating inside Pakistan.\n\nHe also criticised the former PTI government, alleging that it had opened a porous Afghan border and allowed the settlement of 35,000 to 40,000 militants. “Many hardened criminals were released under executive authority,” he said.\n\nMr Zafar echoed Mr Dar’s condemnation of the Khuzdar attack, calling it an “unspeakable atrocity.” He warned that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would continue to harm Pakistan through terrorism. “My heart is heavy, but my resolve is strong,” he said. “Pakistan will not bow, not now, not ever.”\n\nHe added that Pakistan’s measured counterattack against Indian aggression had demonstrated its military, diplomatic, and moral superiority.\n\nPakistan Peoples Party (PPP) leader Sherry Rehman called the Khuzdar tragedy a “second APS massacre” and blamed both the banned the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pak­istan (TTP) and Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), pointing to India’s role in funding and arming such groups.\n\n“Kulbhushan Jadhav was caught and confessed that his job was to fund and facilitate terrorism in Balochistan,” she said.\n\nMs Rehman said Baloch insurgents were not political actors. “This is not how political grievance is addressed,” she said. “Should we respond to this like India did after the Pahalgam attack?”\n\nShe warned that if India avoids engagement, it threatens not just regional peace but the global order. “This needs to be addressed jointly,” she stressed.\n\nPML-N Parliamentary Leader Irfanul Haque Siddiqui said India was directly aiding terror gro­­ups operating in Pakistan. “These terrorists deserve no mercy and must be crushed with full force,” he said, dismissing the claim that such groups were fighting for rights. “Disagree­m­ent does not mean taking arms from the enemy and killing children.”\n\nANP’s Aimal Wali Khan called for implementing the National Action Plan in letter and spirit and questioned the silence over its violations. He emphasised stri­­ct constitutional compliance to overcome Pakistan’s challenges.\n\nSenator Faisal Vawda proposed tripling the defence budget and doubling armed forces’ salaries, urging national unity and prioritisation of defence over development. “We must rise above differences for the sake of national interest,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
