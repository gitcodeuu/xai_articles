  "content": "KARACHI: Exasperated members of the Sindh Assembly on Thursday reached their breaking point over the prolonged loadshedding and K-Electric chief’s repeated no-shows in the house committee meetings, seeking issuance of warrants against the city’s sole power utility chief.\n\nLaw and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Zia Lanjar assured the house that warrants for appearance of KE Chief Executive Officer would be issued if he did not appear in the next house committee meeting.\n\nHe also brought Pakistan Peoples Party’s Muhammad Asif round to withdraw his adjournment motion against the KE for prolonged loadshedding, saying that the house committee was already there to take up his complaint.\n\nThe PPP member from Keamari told the house that it had become too difficult for him to refrain people of his constituency from staging protests and sit-ins and apprehended the breakdown of law and order if the loadshedding did not come to an end.\n\nHe complained that the power utility chief did not bother to attend the meetings of the house committee.\n\nDe-silting of storm-water drains to begin next month, PA told\n\nJamaat-i-Islami member Muhammad Farooq told the house that the house committee meeting was scheduled to be held on Thursday after six months, but KE CEO did not turn up for the second time.\n\nThe JI member said that it was decided in the house committee meeting that the KE would not resort to loadshedding from 12 midnight to 6am, but the decision was not being implemented. He also demanded the cancellation of KE licence.\n\nThe JI member said that that the house committee meeting should be called at once and warrants for the arrest of KE CEO should be issued if he did not attend the meeting.\n\nThe law and parliamentary minister said that the Sindh Assembly should not be considered weak. “If the KE CEO does not come on the appointed date, an arrest warrant will be issued,” he made it clear.\n\nSpeaker Syed Awais Ali Shah also expressed extreme displeasure over the electricity crisis across the province and said that while over 18-hour loadshedding was being carried out in Karachi, there was no electricity in Rohri and other parts of the province for the past two days. “I request the head of the house committee on power distribution companies’ performance to also invite me in the next meeting.”\n\nHe said that the next meeting of the house committee might be held on June 2 so that the chiefs of power distribution companies would have ample time to ensure their presence in the meeting.\n\nOpposition Leader Ali Khurshidi said that the chiefs of all power distribution companies in the province should be called and told to solve the issue.\n\n“We have to chalk out our future course of action, if the power utilities do not pay heed to the directions of the house,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, a KE spokesperson said, “K-Electric holds the Provincial Assembly - Sindh and its elected representatives in the highest regards. Company’s management is committed to ensure adequate representation and provision of requisite information wherever required.”\n\nLocal Government Minister Saeed Ghani informed the house that the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation would begin de-silting all 45 major storm drains in the city from June, ahead of the monsoon season.\n\nIn reply to the call attention notice given by Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan member Quratul Ain Khan, he said that the KMC had demanded Rs800 million for this year’s drainage maintenance.\n\nHe stated that every year, the provincial government financed large-scale de-silting operations and that efforts were also underway to upgrade major drainage systems.\n\nThe local government minister said that plastic bags were the primary cause of clogged drains.\n\nWater shortage\n\nIn response to another call attention notice by JI member Muhammad Farooq regarding severe water shortage in his constituency, PS-91, the local government minister conceded that Karachi’s water supply was insufficient to meet the growing demand. “The city is facing a real water crisis,” he said.\n\nHe assured the house that new water supply projects were in the pipeline, and once implemented, they were expected to significantly improve the situation in affected areas.\n\nWhile responding to the lawmakers’ written and verbal queries during Question Hour, the local government minister said that a large-scale operation against illegal constructions was being carried out across the province, including Karachi.\n\n“From March 2024 to April 2025, more than 2,200 unauthorised structures were demolished,” he added.\n\nHe said that a total of 46 officers received show-cause notices, 28 were suspended, 41 were issued warnings, and 52 were penalised after formal inquiries.\n\nHe said that the district administrations and Town Municipal Corporations had been given authority to act against unauthorised constructions.\n\nHe further informed the house that 12 SBCA officers have had FIRs lodged against them, alongside action taken against owners of illegal structures.\n\nThe house unanimously a resolution condemning the Khuzdar attack. The resolution was presented by PPP’s Sadia Javed.\n\nPPP member Farooq Awan’s resolution to rename Islamabad Airport as Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Airport was also unanimously passed.\n\nThe house unanimously passed the Sindh Centre for Excellence on Countering Violent Extremism Bill.
