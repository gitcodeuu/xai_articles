  "content": "KARACHI: Pakistan is set to begin mango exports from May 25, targeting 125,000 tonnes this season, with projected earnings of $100 million in foreign exchange.\n\nThis was announced by Waheed Ahmed, patron-in-chief of the Pakistan Fruit and Vegetable Exporters Association (PFVA). He said the export target for the current season is 25,000 tonnes higher than last year’s figure. However, he also warned that climate challenges may impact the overall supply of mangoes.\n\nMango production in Pakistan has been consistently declining due to climate change and water scarcity. “There is a risk of up to a 20 per cent reduction in total mango production this year as well,” Mr Ahmed cautioned.\n\nPakistan typically produces around 1.8 million tonnes of mangoes annually, with Punjab contributing 70pc, Sindh 29pc and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa around 1pc. “After the projected 20pc decline, this season’s total production may drop to around 1.4m tonnes,” he added.\n\nMr Ahmed highlighted that efforts are underway to boost mango exports to non-traditional markets. In addition to regular buyers, exporters are now targeting Japan, the United States, South Korea and Australia, while placing special focus on expanding exports to Turkiye and China.\n\nSouth Africa is also expected to open its market to Pakistani mangoes this season. “Quarantine experts from South Af­­rica will visit Pakistan during the season, and we hope this will pave the way for mango exports to begin there,” he stated.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
