Sadaf Shamas was the second batter to return back to the pavilion after scoring 27 off 20, smashing six fours.\n\nAt that stage, Yusra Amir and Natalia Parvaiz stitched a 54-run partnership for the third wicket before Natalia was dismissed by Anoosha Nasir for run-a-ball 28. Following Natalia’s departure, Challengers lost wickets at regular intervals and were restricted to 128 for eight in 20 overs.\n\nStars’ off-spinner Fatima Zahra claimed three key wickets for just 15 runs and was named player-of-the-match. Anoosha, Waheeda and Tuba snapped a wicket each.\n\nBrief scores:\n\nStars beat Challengers by six runs at the National Bank Stadium.\n\nSTARS 134-8 in 20 overs (Tuba Hassan 35, Huraina Sajjad 34, Sidra Nawaz 33; Rameen Shamim 3-14, Gull Rukh 2-7); CHALLENGERS 128-8 in 20 overs (Yusra Amir 45, Natalia Parvaiz 28, Sadaf Shamas 27; Fatima Zahra 3-15).\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
