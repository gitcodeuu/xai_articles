  "content": "QUETTA: Students in Balochistan on Thursday alleged that their scholarships, awarded under the Aghaz-i-Haqooq Balochistan package, were unlawfully revoked by an accountant Muhammad Abdul Qudoos, a move they claim is a misuse of authority and beyond his official mandate.\n\nThe students, who recently came forward with what they described as documented evidence, contend that the accountant arbitrarily cancelled their financial aid. Affected students have announced plans to file a civil lawsuit seeking justice and compensation for educational and financial losses.\n\nThey have also appealed to national and provincial leaders, including President Asif Ali Zardari, the Higher Education Commission (HEC) chairman, the federal minister for education, and Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, to launch an immediate inquiry and take “strict action” against the official.\n\nLegal and administrative experts confirmed that such decisions typically rest with higher authorities and not with accountants. “The cancellation of scholarships does not lie within the purview of an accountant’s responsibilities,” experts said.\n\nThese allegations arise amid previous concerns about the transparency of the scholarship package. Several media outlets in Balochistan have reportedly sought information from the HEC regarding the program’s implementation for months without receiving an official response.\n\nThe Aghaz-i-Haqooq Balochistan initiative was designed to provide local and international scholarships to students from the province to help improve educational standards.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
