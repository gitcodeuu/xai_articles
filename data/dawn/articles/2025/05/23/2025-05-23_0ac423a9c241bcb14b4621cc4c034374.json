But he said any discussions would have to take part under the terms of the treaty.\n\nThe treaty is legally binding and no party can unilaterally suspend it, Awan said.\n\n“As far as Pakistan is concerned, the treaty is very much operational, functional, and anything which India does, it does at its own cost and peril as far as the building of any hydroelectric power projects are concerned,” he added.\n\nThe ceasefire between the countries has largely held, with Indian Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar saying there is no exchange of fire currently and “there has been some repositioning of forces accordingly”.\n\n“The (military) operation continues because there is a clear message…that if there are acts of the kind we saw on April 22, there will be a response, we will hit the terrorists,” Jaishankar told Dutch news outlet NOS.\n\n“If the terrorists are in Pakistan, we will hit them where they are,” he added.\n\nSenate committee\n\nMeanwhile, the Senate Standing Committee on Water Resources on Thu­rs­day said India’s actions threatening Pakistan’s water security were “illegal”.\n\nThe committee members warned Pakistan would not tolerate such provocations.\n\nThe meeting, presided over by Senator Shahadat Awan, discussed the IWT in the light of India’s actions.\n\nPakistan Commissioner for Indus Waters Mehar Ali Shah briefed the panel on the issue.\n\nHe said the treaty was a bilateral agreement between Pakistan and India and cannot be held in abeyance unilaterally.\n\nThe committee unanimously condemned India’s “unlawful and unilateral” declaration of holding the treaty 1960 in abeyance.\n\n“This provocative action would lead to a dangerous escalation and direct threat to the water security, agricultural productivity and livelihoods of 250 million Pakistani citizens that cannot be tolerated by Pakistan”, said the committee in a unanimous statement.\n\nIt said the World Bank president had also recently endorsed that the international agreement could not be held in abeyance by one party and continued.\n\n“The committee is of the view that the treaty remains in force and must be implemented in letter and spirit.”\n\nThe members vowed to “vigorously defend” Pakistan’s rights under the treaty at all international forums.\n\nThis treaty is critically important for Pakistan as a lower-riparian state whose food security and agricultural productivity depend on consistent access to these waters, especially given our increasing climate vulnerability and erratic monsoon cycles, the committee observed.\n\nThe committee also condemned India’s attack on the Neelum Jehlum project, calling the action “nothing less than water warfare and aggression”.\n\n“India’s weaponisation of the Indus Waters Treaty constitutes a red line for the people of Pakistan and the continued interference with Pakistan’s rightful water access under the treaty could threaten the recently established ceasefire between the two countries”, the panel asserted.\n\nThe meeting called upon the international community to take immediate notice of India’s aggression.\n\n“We urge all responsible members of the global community to impress upon India, the importance of honoring its international obligations.”\n\nThe panel reaffirmed that Pakistan was committed to a peaceful resolution of all outstanding issues with India, including the dispute over Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nHowever, Pakistan “will not compromise on existential water rights”.\n\nWith input from Reuters\n\nKhaleeq Kiani in Islamabad also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
