  "content": "LAHORE: The Punjab home department has launched an awareness campaign for children to save them from sexual harassment under the chief minister’s “Safe Children, Safe Punjab” vision.\n\nIn this connection, the home department has developed a special animated films series to raise awareness among the children about “good and bad touch”, releasing its first episode on Thursday.\n\nThe animated series introduces two lead characters Haya and Bahadur, who educate the children how to protect themselves from any kind of sexual abuse.\n\nThese characters guide children about appropriate and inappropriate physical behaviour, sending a powerful message aimed at empowering them to confront the abusers instead of being afraid of them.\n\nA home department spokesperson says the campaign would play a vital role in protecting children from abuse and sexual exploitation.\n\nPunjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal directed the Child Protection & Welfare Bureau to actively lead the awareness drive for children’s protection.\n\nThe department had previously recommended inclusion of “Good Touch, Bad Touch” content in the school curriculum for long-term child safety.\n\nThe spokesperson stressed the need for educating children about personal safety and called upon parents, teachers and other members of society to take part in this critical effort.\n\nThe department urges the public to engage actively in the campaign and help make society safer for children while ensuring that perpetrators of abuse are held accountable by the law.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
