The IMF mission has been in formal engagements with authorities since May 14 and is slated to conclude the visit on Friday (May 23).\n\nThe Fund wants the initial achievements under the programme to move into the next phase without compromising programme objectives. Central to that phase include effective implementation of Agricultural Income Tax across provinces, tangible recoveries from the retail sector alongside expansion of the tax net, financial devolution, and greater contribution from provinces for national security.\n\nThe engagements are likely to continue virtually until the announcement of the federal and provincial budgets and their passage by parliament to ensure no lapses from agreed budgetary propositions.\n\nSources said Pakistan has proposed modest relief measures in the upcoming budget, including a slight reduction in super tax, incentives for the real estate sector and relief for the salaried class.\n\nHowever, the IMF has yet to reach a conclusion and is still examining the viability of such measures in the context of revenue target and expenditures and possible recoveries from litigation cases.\n\nDuring the meeting, also attended by ministers for finance, planning, and economic affairs, besides the finance secretary and the FBR chairman, the discussions focused on the implementation and progress of the ongoing IMF loan programme. Both sides expressed satisfaction over the economic reforms undertaken by the government and their accruing positive outcomes, the official statement said.\n\nThe IMF delegation acknowledged the progress made under the reform agenda and assured the prime minister of continued support from the Fund in the country’s efforts for economic stability and inclusive growth, the statement added.\n\nPM meets WB team\n\nSeparately, the prime minister also met a World Bank delegation led by Managing Director of Operations Anna Bjerde on Thursday and assured her of the steadfast implementation of the economic reform programme necessary to build a solid and sustainable growth. He told the delegation that the government was taking practical steps to achieve maximum benefits from the World Bank’s development investment.\n\nHe hoped that the World Bank’s Country Partnership Framework would bring more than $20bn in development investment to Pakistan and appreciated the World Bank’s assistance to the victims of the 2022 floods in Pakistan that had impacted millions of people, destroying livelihoods and properties.\n\nMs Bjerde said that the World Bank valued its historic partnership with the government of Pakistan for the development and prosperity of its people. She also expressed gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz for his effective role in strengthening the partnership and implementing the Country Partnership Programme.\n\nAlso appreciating Pakistan’s recent exemplary economic performance and stability, she said that through its positive actions for macroeconomic stability, Pakistan had achieved the impossible and the bank looked forward to continued cooperation to achieve the positive outcomes of the Country Partnership Framework and uplift the Pakistani people for which policy continuity for sustainable and inclusive growth was necessary.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
