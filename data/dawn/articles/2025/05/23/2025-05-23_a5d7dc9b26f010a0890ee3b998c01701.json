After accounting for provincial transfers of Rs7,438bn, the net revenue stood at Rs10,377bn, representing a significant 48.7pc increase from the fiscal year 2023-24.\n\nThe government also set an ambitious tax collection target for the Federal Board of Revenue at Rs12,970bn, a 38pc increase from last year’s goal.\n\nEarlier on Friday, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) said that its executive board approved funding for Pakistan after the country “met all the targets” under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme, adding that the loan programme for Islamabad was only for stabilisation of foreign exchange reserves and not related to the budget financing.\n\nDuring a press briefing in Washington DC, IMF Director of the Communications Department, Julie Kozack, said, “Our Board found that Pakistan had indeed met all of the targets. It had made progress on some of the reforms, and for that reason, the Board went ahead and approved the programme.”",
