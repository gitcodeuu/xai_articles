  "content": "BILBAO: Brennan Johnson’s bundled first-half goal helped Tottenham Hotspur win a scrappy Europa League final 1-0 against Manchester United on Wednesday as they cast aside their domestic woes to end a painful 17-year trophy drought.\n\nIn a season where both clubs plummeted down the Premier League, Tottenham emerged from a dismal campaign with something to celebrate as well as a lucrative berth in next season’s Champions League.\n\nIt was Spurs’ first silverware since the 2008 League Cup and their first European trophy since their 1984 UEFA Cup success.\n\nJohnson scored in the 42nd minute when United’s defence crumbled as Pape Sarr swung in a cross while goalkeeper Andre Onana remained rooted to his line. Johnson and United defender Luke Shaw rushed in and the ball appeared to glance off both of them and in, past Onana’s desperate swipe.\n\nThe goal was as scrappy as the game in a matchup of teams who have had wildly disappointing Premier League seasons, with United languishing in 16th and Spurs 17th.\n\nUnited’s Rasmus Hojlund had a terrific chance to equalise with a header midway thr­ough the second half, but Spurs’ Micky van de Ven leapt for a stunning clearance off the line.\n\nUnited almost equalised at the death but Shaw’s header was saved by a diving Guglielmo Vicario, who had earlier denied an Alejandro Garnacho bullet strike from the edge of the box with a great reflex save.\n\n“I still can’t believe what we’ve done tonight, it’s unbelievable,” Vicario said. “We have written history, in the real sense of the term. This group of players has written history in 2025. There was also one Micky van de Ven save, on the line. We knew before the game that we needed the effort from everyone and we did it, we delivered. Now we must celebrate.”\n\nPOSTECOGLOU VINDICATION\n\nTottenham’s win also offered vindication to embattled manager Ange Postecoglou, who had said throughout the campaign that he always wins trophies in his second season at a club.\n\nIn a season defined by Premier League disappointment, their continental conquest represented a stunning reversal of fortunes.\n\nThe victory also rewards Tottenham with Champions League qualification for next season, a remarkable achievement for a side languishing just above the Premier League relegation zone after an alarming 21 defeats.\n\nTheir triumph may well serve as the crucial lifeline that their 59-year-old Greek-Australian manager Postecoglou needed to cement his future at the club.\n\n“I’m still kind of taking it all in,” the manager said.\n\n“I know what it means for this football club... I could sense some nervousness in everybody at the club, because they’ve been in the situation before. And until you take that monkey off your back, you never understand what it feels like.”\n\nFor United, the defeat compou­nds a season of deep frustration.\n\nMired near the bottom of the Premier League, the Red Devils now face the prospect of a campaign without European competition, leaving Ruben Amorim, United’s beleaguered coach, to rebuild at Old Trafford without the draw of European nights.\n\n“I am not going to talk about the future, tonight we need to deal with the pain of losing this match,” Amorim said. “We were the better team and the guys tried everything to win the game.”\n\nUnited had last won a trophy in the 2024 FA Cup, and their last European triumph was at the 2017 Europa League under manager Jose Mourinho. United had also lost the Europa League final to Villarreal in 2021.\n\nAmorim had said winning the trophy would not solve United’s many deep-lying problems but could set the club up well for the future, however United leave Bilbao without even that.\n\n“We managed not to score again, that makes it hard to win matches,” said Amorim.\n\n‘NOWHERE NEAR GOOD ENOUGH’\n\nFor only the second time in 35 years, United will not play European football next term.\n\n“For a club like Manchester United, it’s nowhere near good enough,” Shaw told reporters.\n\nThe final presented a fascinating spectacle: two Premier League underachievers transformed into European contenders and it was Tottenham who proved that European football can provide unexpected redemption.\n\nAmorim’s side will be thoroughly sick of the sight of Spurs, who extended their unbeaten run against United to seven matches, completing an unprecedented seasonal sweep with four wins in four encounters, a first in their history against the Manchester club.\n\nAs jubilant Spurs captain Son Heung-min lifted his first trophy with the club and celebrated with his team-mates beneath cascading confetti in the balmy evening air of Bilbao, Tottenham’s long-suffering faithful rejoiced.\n\nAfter 41 years without European silverware and countless near-misses, they finally had a night to remember.\n\n“Ever since I came here, it’s been ‘Tottenham are a good team but can never get it done’. We got it done,” goalscorer Johnson said.\n\n“Honestly, this is what it means. It means so much. All the fans get battered, we get battered, for not winning a trophy, for not winning anything. But we had to get the first one in a while today. I’m so happy.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
