  "content": "MUZAFFARABAD: Prime Min­ister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday declared that the lesson India had been taught between May 6 and 10 was divine retribution for the 1971 events, asserting that the Modi regime would “think a hundred times” before launching any further aggression against Pakistan.\n\n“This was a great victory gra­n­t­­ed to us by Allah through the pra­y­ers of 240 million Pakistanis, especially the people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir who stood shoulder to shoulder with our armed forces,” he said at a ceremony in Muzaf­farabad for distributing compensation cheques among victims of recent Indian attacks.\n\nThe event was attended by AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar­­ul Haq, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar, federal ministers Ataullah Tarar and Amir Muqam, former AJK premiers, cabinet members, senior civil and military officials, and families of the martyrs.\n\nCalling the recent military res­ponse, a result of “unity from Kel to Karachi,” PM Shehbaz said that Pakistan responded to Indian provocations with restraint and dignity.\n\nDistributes compensation cheques among victims of Indian attacks\n\n“India used the Pahalgam incident as a pretext to level baseless allegations against Pakistan. We told the world these accusations were part of a bigger conspiracy, and offered full cooperation for an international investigation. But when India couldn’t digest this, it launched an attack,” he said.\n\nAccording to him, 33 people were martyred and 55 injured in Bahawalpur and other areas, with additional casualties in AJK. Despite these losses, Pakistan refrained from targeting civilians in its response.\n\n“Instead, we downed six of their aircraft and responded through Al-Fatah demonstrations. The world saw who was right. Many nations, even India’s traditional allies, remained neutral, while others stood by Pakistan,” he said.\n\nThe prime minister lauded Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir’s leadership during the escalation.\n\n“This may have been one of the shortest wars in history, and our army chief displayed brave, wise, and God-trusting leadership that brought immense success. If the nation is calling him field marshal today, it’s an honour for all of us,” he said. He also praised Air Chief Marshal Zahe­­er Babar and the Pakistan Navy, saying all forces had acted with remarkable professionalism.\n\n“These sons of the soil raised Pakis­tan’s stature like never before,” he said.\n\nReferring to perceptions about Pakistan’s military capability, he said, “Some believed Pakistan lagged behind in conventional warfare. This war has ended that illusion. Thankfully, there was no need for our nuclear arsenal — and God willing, there never will be.”\n\nHe urged the continuation of national unity and hard work, stressing that economic stability was now within reach.\n\n“Even the IMF is acknowledging our efforts. True appreciation will be when we repay all debts and stand on our own feet.”\n\nPaying tribute to the struggling Kashmiris, PM Shehbaz said: “From Tihar Jail to every blood-soaked street of Kashmir, our brothers and sisters have resisted Indian oppression with unmatched courage.”\n\n“From Muzaffarabad, I send a message to Srinagar: Pakistan will never step back from your just cause. We will continue to extend diplomatic and political support until the day Kashmir becomes part of Pakistan and its people receive their rights.”\n\nCompensation package\n\nPM Sharif said families of civilian martyrs were being given Rs10 million each, while the injured civilians received between Rs1 to Rs2 million. Army martyrs’ families would receive Rs10 to 18 million, in addition to Rs19 to 42 million for housing, depending on rank. Salaries and allowances would continue till the martyrs’ retirement date. Daughters would receive Rs1 million for marriage; children’s education would be free up to graduation. The injured soldiers would receive Rs2 to 5 million.\n\n“No amount can replace a loved one,” he said, “but the state has a duty to support those left behind. These measures have been taken humbly, without publicity, and are being implemented swiftly.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 23rd, 2025",
