It’s in honour of the United States. Better than in honour of me. Let’s give it to the country. That’s a great tribute.”\n\nThe UAE’s leaders want US help to make their wealthy Gulf nation a global leader in Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nThe US has a preliminary agreement with the UAE to allow it to import 500,000 of Nvidia’s most advanced AI chips a year, starting this year, Reuters reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe deal would boost the UAE’s construction of data centres vital to developing AI models.\n\nBut the agreement has provoked national security concerns among sectors of the US government, and the terms could change, sources said.\n\nAt the presidential palace, Trump and Sheikh Mohamed could be seen in TV footage in conversation with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\n\nTrump said he would probably return to Washington on Friday after a regional trip that began on Tuesday, although he said it was “almost destination unknown — because they’ll be getting calls, ‘could you be here? Could you be there?’”\n\nTrump had hinted that he could stop in Istanbul for talks on Ukraine.\n\nThe two countries have finalised a technology framework agreement that was expected to be signed later on Thursday, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe agreement requires commitments on both sides to the security of technology, the source said, without immediately providing details.\n\nSome big business agreements have been signed during Trump’s four-day swing through the Gulf region, including a deal for Qatar Airways to purchase up to 210 Boeing widebody jets, a $600bn commitment from Saudi Arabia to invest in the US and $142 billion in U.S. arms sales to the kingdom.\n\nThe trip has also brought a flurry of diplomacy.\n\nTrump said in Qatar that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.\n\nHe also announced on Tuesday that the US would remove longstanding sanctions on Syria and subsequently met with Syrian interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa.\n\nHe urged Sharaa to establish ties with Syria’s longtime foe, Israel.\n\nAI is likely to be a focus of the final leg of Trump’s trip.\n\nFormer US president Joe Biden’s administration had imposed strict oversight of exports of US AI chips to the Middle East and other regions.\n\nAmong the Biden administration’s fears were that the prized semiconductors would be diverted to China and buttress Beijing’s military strength.\n\nTrump has made improving ties with some Gulf countries a key goal of his administration.\n\nIf all the proposed chip deals in Gulf states, and the UAE in particular, come together, the region would become a third power centre in global AI competition after the United States and China.\n\nTrump compared his visit to Saudi Arabia with one by his predecessor in 2022, when Biden gave the Saudi crown prince a fist bump.\n\n“I shook more hands, more than any human being is capable of doing,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One.\n\n“He travels all the way to Saudi Arabia, in that case, and he gives him a fist bump. That’s not what they want. They don’t want a fist bump. They want to shake his hand.”",
