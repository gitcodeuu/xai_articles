  "content": "KARACHI: Two young brothers were arrested on Wednesday morning on charges of allegedly murdering their father who insisted they study hard.\n\nJauharabad SHO Rashid Rehman told Dawn that the youths were riding a bike when a police patrol signalled them to stop for checking in F.B Area, Block-15 at 3:45am. They were carrying a suspicious bag. Upon checking, the body of a man, later identified as Khawar Anjum, 60, was found in the bag.\n\nThe police took Mohammed Ibrahim, 24, and his brother, Afzal, 21, into custody. During grilling, the suspects disclosed that they did not want to pursue their studies. Therefore, their father had asked them to go to their native place in Mirpurkhas to look after their agricultural land and animals, but they also did not want to return to the village life.\n\nThey said that around 15 days ago, they decided to kill their father. On Tuesday night, after dinner, they laced a cold drink with pesticides and gave it to their father, who fell unconscious after drinking it. Then they stabbed him to death and put his body in a gunny bag. They were taking it to dump somewhere when the police caught them.\n\nThe body was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities.\n\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that there were multiple injuries all over the body. Death occurred due to loss of blood. A rope around the neck was also found.\n\nCentral SSP Zeeshan Shafiq Siddiqi told Dawn that the investigators had obtained the CCTV footage, which showed three people along with the body bag and a motorcycle.\n\nThe video showed one person was walking the motorcycle, on which there was a bag, and the second person was supporting the bag while walking along the bike.\n\nThe third one could be seen in the footage opening the gate of the seminary from which they came out and went away.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 15th, 2025",
