  "content": "SWAT: In an effort to maintain law and order and enhance preparedness for any potential security threat, the police conducted a large-scale mock exercise at the University of Swat on the directives of district police officer Mohammad Umar Khan.\n\nThe exercise was led by SP Headquarters Attaullah Shams and involved coordinated participation from the district police, Elite Force, Rescue 1122, and Civil Defence personnel.\n\nThe primary objective of the simulation was to test the efficiency, readiness, and coordination among various security and emergency response agencies. The exercise simulated a terrorist threat scenario within the university premises, requiring swift tactical response, evacuation procedures, and emergency medical aid.\n\nDuring the drill, multiple university buildings were surrounded and cleared by security personnel, while staff members were safely escorted to designated secure zones. Rescue teams practised transporting mock casualties to nearby hospitals, and police units simulated the arrest and transfer of suspects to local police stations. The entire operation was carried out in real-time conditions to provide a realistic training environment for the participating forces.\n\nSpeaking to media representatives, officials stated that such mock exercises were vital for enhancing the operational capability of law enforcement agencies and ensuring an effective and coordinated response during real-life emergencies. They added that educational institutions remain critical locations where preparedness for unforeseen incidents is essential.\n\nSP Attaullah Shams noted that the exercise demonstrated the improved synergy between different departments and expressed satisfaction over the performance of all participating units.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 15th, 2025",
