  "content": "US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States was getting very close to securing a nuclear deal with Iran, and Tehran had “sort of” agreed to the terms.\n\n“We’re in very serious negotiations with Iran for long-term peace,” Trump said on a tour of the Gulf, according to a shared pool report by AFP.\n\n“We’re getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this … there [are] two steps to doing this, there is a very, very nice step and there is the violent step, but I don’t want to do it the second way,” he said.\n\nAn Iranian source familiar with the negotiations said there were still gaps to bridge in the talks with the United States.\n\nFresh talks between Iranian and US negotiators to resolve disputes over Tehran’s nuclear programme ended in Oman on Sunday with further negotiations planned, officials said, as Tehran publicly insisted on continuing its uranium enrichment.\n\nThough Tehran and Washington have both said they prefer diplomacy to resolve the decades-long nuclear dispute, they remain divided on several red lines that negotiators will have to circumvent to reach a new deal and avert future military action.\n\nIran’s president reacted to Trump’s comments on Tuesday, calling Tehran the “most destructive force” in the Middle East.\n\n“Trump thinks he can sanction and threaten us and then talk of human rights. All the crimes and regional instability are caused by them (the United States),” Masoud Pezeshkian said.\n\n“He wants to create instability inside Iran.”\n\nUS officials have publicly stated that Iran should halt uranium enrichment, a stance Iranian officials have called a “red line” asserting they will not give up what they view as their right to enrich uranium on Iranian soil.\n\nHowever, they have indicated a willingness to reduce the level of enrichment.\n\nIranian officials have also expressed readiness to reduce the amount of highly enriched uranium in storage — uranium enriched beyond the levels typically needed for civilian purposes, such as nuclear power generation.\n\nHowever, they have said it would not accept lower stockpiles than the amount agreed in a deal with world powers in 2015 — the deal Trump quit.\n\nThe Iranian source said that while Iran is prepared to offer what it considers concessions, the “issue is that America is not willing to lift major sanctions in exchange”.\n\nWestern sanctions have severely impacted the Iranian economy.\n\nRegarding the reduction of enriched uranium in storage, the source noted: “Tehran also wants it removed in several stages, which America doesn’t agree with either.”\n\nThere is also disagreement over the destination to which the highly enriched uranium would be sent, the source added.",
