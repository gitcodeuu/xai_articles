  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Standing Committee on Commerce has recommended that the government grant a one-year extension to the elected office-bearers of the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI) to synchronise their tenure with that of other chambers.\n\nThe committee meeting, chaired by MNA Muhammad Jawed Hanif Khan, was held at the Parliament House on Wednesday and discussed “The Trade Organisation (Amendment) Bill, 2025,” moved by MNA Syed Ali Qasim Gillani.\n\nThe committee reaffirmed its earlier recommendations, which include extending the tenure of chambers whose elections were held in 2024 from the curtailed one-year period — mandated under the proviso to Section 11A of the Trade Organisations Act, 2023 — back to the original two-year term. This adjustment would ensure that the next elections are held in 2026.\n\nThe committee directed the Ministry of Commerce, in consultation with the Law Division, to implement these recommendations either through amending the Act or by exercising the federal government’s powers under Section 3(9) of the Act.\n\nFollowing a comprehensive discussion, the committee unanimously approved the bill as introduced in the house.\n\nThe committee members acknowledged the importance of resolving anomalies in the Trade Organisations Act to ensure smooth and consistent operations of trade bodies across the country.\n\nThe approved amendments are intended to align the tenure of trade associations and chambers, thereby addressing discrepancies caused by previous legislative changes. The committee chairman emphasised that this timely intervention would establish the necessary legal framework to support the effective functioning and leadership continuity of trade organisations.\n\nThe meeting was attended by MNAs Muhammad Mobeen Arif, Dr Mirza Ikhtiar Baig, Choudhary Iftikhan Nazir, Muhammad Atif, Asad Alam Niazi, Muhammad Ahmed Chattha, Tahira Aurangzeb, Gul Asghar Khan, and Syed Ali Qasim Gillani. MNAs Farhan Chishti, Muhammad Ali Sarfaraz and Rana Atif participated virtually. Senior officers from the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Law and Justice were also present.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 15th, 2025",
