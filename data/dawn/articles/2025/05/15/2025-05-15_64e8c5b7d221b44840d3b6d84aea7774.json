The United States is poised to be named host of the 2031 edition, which will be expanded to 48 teams from 32.\n\nInfantino also said there was massive potential for football to generate more revenue outside Europe.\n\n“If the rest of the world, in particular Saudi Arabia or the United States of America, would do just 20% of what Europe does in football, we (could reach an amount of over) half a trillion (dollars) or more of GDP impact (with our sport),” he added.\n\n“Saudi Arabia, by the way, is doing exceptionally good, as well, by creating a women’s league, a women’s national team. Women’s football is really the only team sport for women that has such a huge audience and impact as well.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 15th, 2025",
