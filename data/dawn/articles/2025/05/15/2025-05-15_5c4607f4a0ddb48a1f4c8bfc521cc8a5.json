  "content": "Pakistan strongly condemns the remarks of the Indian Defence Minister on its nuclear arsenal, made today in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nIn a statement, Foreign Office spokesperson Shafqat Ali Khan says, “These irresponsible remarks reveal his profound insecurity and frustration regarding Pakistan’s effective defence and deterrence against Indian aggression through conventional means. Pakistan’s conventional capabilities are adequate to deter India, without the self-imposed ‘nuclear blackmail’ that New Delhi suffers.”\n\n“The comments of India’s Defence Minister also show his sheer ignorance of the mandate and responsibilities of a specialised agency of the United Nations like the IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency)”, the FO spokesperson comments.\n\nFurthermore, the spokesperson raised questions on India’s involvement in “repeated theft” and “illicit trafficking incidents” involving nuclear and radioactive material in India. He thinks the IAEA and the international community should be worried about that instead.\n\n“Just last year, five individuals with a radioactive device reportedly stolen from the Bhabha Atomic Research Centre (BARC) were found in Dehradun, India.\n\nLater, a gang of individuals was found with illegal possession of a highly radioactive and toxic substance, Californium, worth $100 million. Three incidents of theft of Californium were also reported in 2021.“\n\nHe questions the measures taken by New Delhi “for the safety and security of nuclear and other radioactive material.”\n\n“These incidents also suggest the existence of a black market for sensitive, dual-use materials inside India.”\n\nIn his statement, he states that “Pakistan urges a thorough investigation of these incidents” and “calls upon India to ensure the safety and security of its nuclear facilities and arsenal.”\n\nEarlier today, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh has said, “Pakistan’s nuclear arsenal should be under the surveillance of the UN’s nuclear watchdog.”\n\nHe questioned if “nuclear weapons safe in the hands of a rogue and irresponsible nation” and stated that “Pakistan’s atomic weapons should be brought under the surveillance of the IAEA.”",
