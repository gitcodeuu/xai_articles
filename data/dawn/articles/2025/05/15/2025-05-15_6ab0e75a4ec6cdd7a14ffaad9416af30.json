  "content": "TRIPOLI: The worst fighting in Libya’s capital for years calmed on Wednesday after the government announced a ceasefire, Tripoli residents said, while there was no immediate statement from authorities on how many people had been killed.\n\nClashes broke out late on Monday after the killing of a major militia leader. After calming on Tuesday morning, the fighting reignited overnight, with major battles rocking districts across the entire city.\n\n“Regular forces, in coordination with the relevant security authorities, have begun taking the necessary measures to ensure calm, including the deployment of neutral units,” the defence ministry said.\n\nThe ministry said the neutral units it was deploying around sensitive sites were from the police force, which does not carry heavy weapons. After the fighting, burned-out cars littered the streets in some areas, and nearby buildings were pocked with bullet marks.\n\nMonday’s clashes had appeared to consolidate the power of Abdulhamid al-Dbeibah, prime minister of the divided country’s Government of National Unity (GNU) and an ally of Turkiye.\n\nHowever, any prolonged fighting within Tripoli risks drawing in factions from outside the capital, potentially leading to a wider escalation between Libya’s many armed players after years of relative calm.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 15th, 2025",
