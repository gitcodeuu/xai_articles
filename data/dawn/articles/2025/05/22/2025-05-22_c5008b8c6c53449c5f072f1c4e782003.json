The children were most vulnerable to abuse in the age group of 11-15 years, in which more boys than girls were reported.\n\nA 17-year-old girl died by suicide in April after she was allegedly raped and impregnated in Punjab’s Muzaffargarh.\n\nOn Tuesday, the police arrested four suspects involved in an alleged gang rape of a mentally-challenged minor in Lahore.",
