  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Wednesday pres­sed the acting chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) to expedite hearings on petitions seeking the suspension of sentences awarded to party founder Imran Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, in the £190 million corruption case.\n\nSpeaking to the media outside the IHC, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan also reiterated the party’s support for armed forces, stressing that Islamabad had achieved a significant diplomatic and moral victory in the face of heightened tensions with New Delhi.\n\nOn the occasion, dozens of PTI workers and assembly members had gathered on Constitution Avenue, staging a protest and demanding the release of Imran Khan. Mr Gohar — accompanied by Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Barrister Ali Zafar, Latif Khosa, Shibli Faraz, Aliya Hamza and others — called for an end to what he termed the unjust incarceration of the PTI founder.\n\nThe PTI leadership ended their protest after Aleema Khan’s arrival, vowing to return next week when the hearing is expected to be scheduled.\n\nAccording to the party’s lawyer, Shoaib Shaheen, the acting chief justice had assured them that the case would be scheduled next week.\n\nMeanwhile, the investigation team arrived at Adiala Jail from Lahore to conduct a polygraph test of Imran Khan in connection with nine cases registered against him on May 9, 2023. However, he refused to undergo the test, citing a constitutional provision under which one can’t be forced to testify.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 22nd, 2025",
