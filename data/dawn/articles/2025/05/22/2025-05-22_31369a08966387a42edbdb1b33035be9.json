Together, the two organisations will work across 32 watersheds covering 19 districts.\n\nThe FAO said the collaboration aims to deepen grassroots support for sustainable water, agriculture, and livestock management. “These efforts contribute to inclusive participation and more effective delivery of climate-resilient interventions under RBWRP,” the statement said.\n\nThe RBWRP is a five-year, 40m-euro initiative funded by the European Union and implemented by the FAO in coordination with the government of Balochistan. Scheduled for completion in September 2026, the programme focuses on rehabilitating and managing water resources, improving rangelands and spate irrigation systems, and promoting climate-smart farming practices.\n\nThe programme is expected to have four outcomes: effective governance structures that will sustainably and equitably deliver evidence-based oversight of water and rangeland resources at provincial, river basin, watershed, and community levels; transition to low water use agriculture and livestock farming systems; water efficient and profitable agricultural value chains; and enhanced core capacities of government institutions, academia, community, and the private sector to support and manage their water and rangeland resources sustainably and equitably.\n\n“These agreements mark a significant step toward expanding RBWRP’s outreach and impact in Balochistan,” the FAO said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 22nd, 2025",
