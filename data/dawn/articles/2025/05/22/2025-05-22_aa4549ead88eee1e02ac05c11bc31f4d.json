Noting Bar’s decision to quit the job, the supreme court ruling said that “this announcement puts an end to the (legal) procedure”.\n\nIn its ruling, the Supreme Court determined that the dismissal was done in violation of the law, and that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had a conflict of interest because of an investigation into the “Qatar-Gate” affair.\n\nBar announced his resignation in April, saying he would step down on June 15, six weeks after Netanyahu tried to oust him.\n\nNext intel chief\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that his government would appoint the country’s next domestic intelligence agency chief, despite Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara barring him from doing so.\n\n“Under my command, the government of Israel will appoint the next head of the Shin Bet” agency, Netanyahu said in his first televised presser since December.\n\nIsrael’s attorney general barred Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu from appointing the next head of the domestic intelligence agency, after the supreme court ruled his decision to sack outgoing Shin Bet chief Ronen Bar was illegal.\n\n“The court ruled that the prime minister acted in a situation of conflict of interest,” Attorney General Gali Baharav-Miara said, adding that “as a result, he must refrain from any action related to the appointment of a new head of the Shin Bet until legal guidelines are established to ensure the integrity of the process.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 22nd, 2025",
