The bench also directed to club the plea with another petition filed by former additional director general sports, Tariq Mahmood (now retired), who has also been charged along with Mahmood Khan in the said FIR.\n\nAdvocate Sultan Mohammad Khan appeared for Mahmood Khan and stated that his client had received a notice on Sept 3, 2024, which declared that an inquiry was going on regarding the petitioner’s tenure as the provincial minister and as such was related to events that were almost about a decade old.\n\nHigh court issues notice to ACE for response to petition\n\nHe said that the inquiry was started by ACE over a ‘source report’ on the matter when he was the sports minister in the cabinet of the then chief minister Pervez Khattak.\n\nHe said that ACE had alleged that as a provincial minister, Mahmood had transferred government funds to the tune of Rs1.8 million to his personal accounts for onward distribution among deserving players.\n\nHe argued that the petitioner had challenged the inquiry through an earlier petition, he came to know that ACE had subsequently registered the FIR in the matter following which he field the instant petition for quashing the FIR.\n\nMr Sultan said that his client had been elected multiple times to important public offices, including nazim, MPA, provincial minister and chief minister.\n\nHe said that the people of the province in general and that of Swat area in particular had time and again reposed their trust in Mr Mahmood because of his selfless services provided to the people.\n\nThe counsel said that the last general elections were held on Feb 8, 2024, which led to the formation of a new government both at federal and provincial levels.
