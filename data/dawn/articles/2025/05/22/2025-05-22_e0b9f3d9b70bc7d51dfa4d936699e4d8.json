Those responsible deserve no leniency,” he stated.\n\nHe also condemned the terrorist assault on a security checkpoint near the vegetable market in Bannu, which resulted in the martyrdom of two police personnel. Offering condolences to the families of the victims, he said the QWP stands shoulder to shoulder with the affected families in their grief.\n\nSherpao stressed that the presence of external elements in both attacks cannot be ruled out and called for comprehensive investigations into the Khuzdar tragedy.
