Therefore, Eidul Azha will be celebrated across Pakistan on June 7.\n\nIt added that the Central Ruet-e-Hilal Committee holds the final authority to confirm the moon’s sighting based on eyewitness testimonies and weather conditions.\n\nCelebrated on the 10th of Zilhaj, Eidul Azha marks the culmination of Haj, one of the five pillars of Islam.",
