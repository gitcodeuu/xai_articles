  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A high-level delegation from Deloitte Advisory US, led by Richard Longstaff, on Wednesday called on Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan to discuss strategic reforms, institutional development and investment facilitation.\n\nRichard Longstaff expressed Deloitte’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s energy and economic goals through global expertise.\n\nSofyan Yusufi, Deloitte’s lead advisory partner, emphasised the need for sector-specific, practical initiatives rather than broad, unfocused strategies, according to a press release.\n\nJam Kamal underlined the importance of clarity and coordination across ministries, noting past failures due to vague priorities and poor implementation. He urged a focus on achievable, pilot-based models and encouraged Deloitte to align with national priorities such as exports, climate resilience, and institutional capacity.\n\nYusufi supported a co-development model with Pakistani teams, stressing the importance of stakeholder engagement and readiness.\n\nBoth sides agreed that success requires a strategic framework with clear goals and involvement from international partners like the World Bank and IMF.\n\nHighlighting a new Strategic Trade Policy Framework aimed at accelerated growth in exports over five years, the minister invited Deloitte to focus its support on the identified priority sectors.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 22nd, 2025",
