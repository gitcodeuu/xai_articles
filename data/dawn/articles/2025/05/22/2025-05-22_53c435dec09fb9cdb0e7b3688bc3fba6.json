Vehicles were twisted and charred, with one still burning.\n\n“We have one car fire that just will not go out no matter what we put on it right now,” Eddy told reporters.\n\nThe accident happened in thick fog when the plane, which had come from Kansas, was nearing the Montgomery-Gibbs Executive Airport.\n\nThe plane, which can carry up to eight people, went down around 3:45am (1145 GMT, 4:45pm PKT), according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), striking the Murphy Canyon neighbourhood.\n\nThe residential area it hit is largely military housing. San Diego is home to US Navy facilities, Marine Corps bases and Coast Guard stations.\n\nZane Baker, a high school senior who lives in the area, said police officers had gone door-to-door getting people out of their homes.\n\n“I immediately just rushed to the front door, just looking outside, seeing what’s happening,” he told broadcaster KTLA. “I made sure all my siblings were awake and they were conscious and they were okay.”\n\nBaker, who described himself as a “Navy rat” — the son of a servicemember — said scores of people had been evacuated from their homes, with many now milling around in confusion.\n\n“The entirety of our parking lots and other areas are completely filled,” he said. “A lot of the entryways are blocked. People can’t get in or out. It’s a confusing mess.”\n\nThe accident came at a time of heightened tension in the skies above America, with a number of incidents rocking public confidence in flying.\n\nAir traffic control outages have struck the busy Newark airport on the East Coast at least twice in recent weeks, and in January, there was a mid-air collision over Washington between a passenger plane and a military helicopter.\n\nThis month, two people who were onboard a small plane died when it crashed into a residential neighbourhood northwest of Los Angeles.",
