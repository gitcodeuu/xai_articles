  "content": "NEW DELHI: Cricket legend Virat Kohli was announced on Wednesday as the newest investor in the World Bowling League.\n\nThe Indian superstar joins the Los Angeles Dodgers’ Mookie Betts as high-profile partners in the venture.\n\nLike Betts, announced in March as the owner of the WBL’s Team OMG, Kohli has been bowling since childhood.\n\n“I started bowling when I was 11 years old, spinning the ball by 12,” Kohli shared. “It is evident how popular the sport is while being underappreciated as a business proposition.”\n\nKohli, 36, is the world’s third-most followed athlete on Instagram behind only soccer icons Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, according to a WBL press release.\n\n“When I discovered Virat is also a bowler, it was exciting to align on this new-age vision for the sport,” said Adi K. Mishra, founder and CEO of League Sports Co., the WBL’s owner.\n\n“Virat’s relentless drive for sports mirrors our own. Every week, we uncover more about bowling’s global depth and fascinating history -- it’s a sleeping giant we’re ready to awaken.”\n\nThe WBL hasn’t announced the remainder of its team lineup, but there are expected to be franchises around the world, including in Dubai.\n\nWhen the league’s formation was announced in 2023, organisers said the WBL would have 12 to 15 events per year, held from the United States to Europe to Asia, with hopes of expansion within five years.\n\nBetween eight and 12 franchises were expected to compete in the first year, with each team featuring at least two women to promote gender balance.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
