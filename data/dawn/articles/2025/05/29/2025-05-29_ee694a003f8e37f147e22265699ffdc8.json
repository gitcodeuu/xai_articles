  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The purported rise in corrosive ingestion cases has alarmed doctors at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), who fear that household cleaners are increasingly being consumed, particularly by women, to attempt suicide.\n\nCorrosive ingestion refers to the consumption of substances that can cause chemical burns and damage to the gastrointestinal tract.\n\nThese substances, often found in household cleaners or industrial chemicals, can cause immediate symptoms like burning in the mouth and throat, drooling, and vomiting, and may result in severe long-term complications.\n\nThe severity of injury depends on the substance, its concentration, the amount ingested, and the duration of exposure.\n\nMedical experts urge policymakers to develop strategy to address the pressing public health issue\n\nThe health experts said that although most patients do not die, they often suffer lifelong health complications.\n\nThey urged policymakers to take notice and develop a strategy to address the issue, as it does not fall directly under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health.\n\nA doctor at the Pims, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that as many as five women were admitted to the hospital last week with corrosive ingestion.\n\n“In all five cases, the patients’ attendants claimed they drank toilet cleaner by mistake. I’ve been hearing similar excuses for many years and every time, I’m certain it’s actually a case of attempted suicide,” he said.\n\n“Whether intentional or unintentional, the consumption of corrosive or caustic substances is a serious public health concern. Most of our patients are young women who are emotionally vulnerable. Many come from lower socio-economic backgrounds and use toilet cleaners,” he added.\n\nAnother doctor noted that one or two patients are brought to the emergency department almost daily, though most are discharged after receiving first aid.\n\n“On average, one or two patients are admitted to the hospital each week due to complications from ingesting corrosive substances. While most claim the incident was accidental, in reality it is often intentional, usually following domestic disputes, or conflicts involving young women and their fiancés or parents,” he said.\n\nDr Haider Abbasi, agastroenterologist at Pims, toldDawnthat these patients rarely die immediately, but also cannot return to a normal life.\n\n“After initial resuscitation and stabilisation, we perform an endoscopy to assess the extent of injuries to the food pipe and oesophagus. Some patients end up in the ICU or die from respiratory complications, but most survive and later return with long-term complications, such as strictures in the oesophagus or stomach. They frequently visit the hospital for procedures to dilate these strictures or for surgery,” he explained.\n\nHe said such cases not only place a burden on government hospitals but also ruin the lives of both the patients and their families.\n\n“Public awareness is essential, and there should be legislation to regulate the sale of toilet cleaners, which are usually chemical industry by-products. Because these substances are not dense, they are easy to ingest. Moreover, they are widely used due to their low cost,” Dr Abbasi added.\n\nWhen asked whether males are also affected, he said that men with psychological disorders are occasionally reported with similar cases. According to Pims data, 75 patients were admitted to the hospital in 2023 due to corrosive ingestion.\n\n“A few deaths are reported every year. Many patients also return months later with complications, which become difficult to manage. Since the issue does not fall directly under the Ministry of Health, decision-makers should take appropriate action,” Dr Abbasi suggested.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
