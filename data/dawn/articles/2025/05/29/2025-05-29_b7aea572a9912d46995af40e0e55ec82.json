  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Freelancers Association (Pafla) and the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) will establish co-working spaces for more than 50,000 freelancers every year across Pakistan.\n\nThe Pafla and Innovista, an arm of the SIFC, signed the agreement on Wednesday to improve the digital infrastructure for freelancers.\n\nPafla Chairman Ibrahim Amin and Innovista CEO Hisham Sarwar said the initiative was aimed at empowering youth across Pakistan through freelancing and digital skills.\n\nMr Amin added that freelancers bring foreign exchange to Pakistan and create self-sufficiency across sectors. Hence, they deserve infrastructure and recognition at par with traditional sectors.\n\nMr Sarwar, the Innovista CEO, said under the initiative, freelancers would be trained and granted access to technology, financial literacy and global client connectivity to “unlock the full potential of Pakistan’s freelancers”.\n\nInnovista will deploy its digital tools, learning modules, and community engagement resources to create an inclusive environment for Pakistani freelancers, especially women and youth in underserved regions, he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
