  "content": "KARACHI: The Karachi University (KU) administration has sought Rs200 million compensation from the Sindh government on account of damage caused to the university infrastructure and property following a rupture of an 84-inch pipeline last month.\n\nIn a letter to the secretary of universities and boards department, the university registrar has stated that the pipeline burst in the early hours of Tuesday, April 29, 2025, resulted in flooding of residential units and academic departments, causing severe damage to the university property.\n\n“The whole unfortunate incident lasted for almost a week causing electrical power outages and significant material losses. It also severely affected academic continuity and welfare of students and staff. The rupture occurred in the water supply line maintained by the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation [KWSC],” the letter says.\n\nAccording to the letter, the university suffered losses worth Rs200m as a result of the incident.\n\n“We would appreciate if you take immediate action on the matter and request for the initiation of necessary procedures for compensation,” the letter says.\n\nMeanwhile, the Karachi University Teachers’ Society has held a meeting, calling upon the chief minister to take notice of KWSC’s “criminal negligence” and bind the utility to compensate the university for the damage.\n\nThe teachers warned that they might opt for protest for their rights, if relevant authorities didn’t pay heed to their issues.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
