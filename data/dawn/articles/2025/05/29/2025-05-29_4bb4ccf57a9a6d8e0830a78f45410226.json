  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The by-election for a Senate seat, which was earlier scheduled to be held today (Thursday), has been postponed.\n\nA source in the Election Commission of Pakistan said the decision was taken in light of an ongoing case in the Supreme Court concerning reserved seats.\n\nAn official explained that a new senator will be elected once the electoral college of the Punjab Assembly is complete.\n\nInterestingly, the provincial election commission had already accepted the nomination papers of four candidates for the Senate seat that fell vacant following the death of Professor Sajid Mir, who had headed a political party, but was elected to the upper house on a ticket awarded to him by the PML-N.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
