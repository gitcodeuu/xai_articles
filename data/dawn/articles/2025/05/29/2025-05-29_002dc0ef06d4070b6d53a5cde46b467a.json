Hamas denies stealing aid and says it has protected aid trucks from looters.\n\nEven as thousands made their way to the distribution site, Israeli jets continued to pound areas of Gaza, killing at least 45 people on Thursday, including 23 people in a strike that hit several houses in the Bureij camp in the central Gaza Strip, Palestinian medical workers said.\n\nThe Israeli military said it hit dozens of targets in Gaza overnight, including what it said were weapons storage dumps, sniper positions and tunnels.\n\nSpeculation around a possible ceasefire agreement grew after US President Donald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said the White House was preparing a draft document that could provide the basis for an agreement.\n\nHowever, it was unclear what changes to previous proposals were being considered that might overcome the deep differences between Hamas and Israel that have stymied previous attempts to restore a ceasefire deal that broke down in March after only two months.\n\nIsrael has insisted that Hamas disarm completely and be dismantled as a military and governing force and that all of the 58 hostages still held in Gaza must come back before it will agree to end the conflict.\n\nHamas has rejected the demand to give up its weapons and says Israel must commit to ending the conflict for a deal to work.\n\nIsrael has come under increasing international pressure, with many European countries that have normally been reluctant to criticise Israel openly demanding an end to the conflict and a major humanitarian relief effort.\n\nIsrael launched its campaign in Gaza in response to the devastating attack on communities in southern Israel on Oct 7, 2023, that killed some 1,200 people and saw 251 taken hostage into Gaza, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nThe campaign has killed more than 54,000 Palestinians and left the enclave in ruins, forcing most of its population to move multiple times, Gaza health officials say.\n\nHeader image: Displaced Palestinians carrying relief supplies return from an aid distribution centre in the central Gaza Strip on May 29. — AFP",
