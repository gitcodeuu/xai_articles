The school teacher is in critical condition.”\n\nKP Inspector General of Police Zulfiqar Hameed was also on a visit to the region for reviewing the security situation, he said.\n\nThe spokesperson added that people were “fed up with the terrorists and retaliated whenever they came across them”.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities over the past year, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022, vowing to target security forces, police, and law enforcement agencies personnel.\n\nEarlier this month, a policeman was shot dead by unidentified assailants in the limits of the Mandan police station in Bannu.",
