  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Minister for Finance and Minerals Shoaib Nosherwani has said that strengthening the local government is the foundation of true democracy, and by devolving powers to the grassroots level, many public issues can be resolved at their doorstep.\n\nThe provincial minister stated this while presiding over the 11th Local Council and Finance Commission meeting, which was attended by Secretary Local Government Abdul Rauf Baloch, Special Secretary Finance Jahangir Kakar and others. Adviser on Local Government Hamza Zehri joined the huddle via video.\n\nAddressing representatives of the local government, Mr Nosherwani said the municipal authorities should increase their revenue with the view to achieve some financial autonomy. He directed the purchase of fire brigade vehicles should be expedited to ensure effective response in emergencies.\n\nThe minister further stated that grants given to local governments would be increased so that development projects at the grassroots level can start quickly. The provincial government will provide full cooperation to strengthen local institutions because active local governments guarantee the resolution of public issues, he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
