It says there is a 70pc chance that average warming across the 2025-2029 period will exceed 1.5C.\n\n“This is entirely consistent with our proximity to passing 1.5C on a long-term basis in the late 2020s or early 2030s,” said Peter Thorne, director of the Irish Climate Analysis and Research Units group at the University of Maynooth.\n\n“I would expect in two to three years this probability to be 100 percent” in the five-year outlook, he added.\n\nThe WMO says there is an 80pc chance that at least one year between 2025 and 2029 will be warmer than the current warmest year on record: 2024.\n\nLonger-term outlook\n\nTo smooth out natural climate variations, several methods assess long-term warming, the WMO’s climate services director Christopher Hewitt told a press conference.\n\nOne approach combines observations from the past 10 years with projections for the next decade (2015-2034). With this method, the estimated current warming is 1.44C.\n\nThere is no consensus yet on how best to assess long-term warming.\n\nThe EU’s climate monitor Copernicus believes that warming currently stands at 1.39C, and projects 1.5C could be reached in mid-2029 or sooner.\n\nAlthough “exceptionally unlikely” at one percent, there is now an above-zero chance of at least one year in the next five exceeding 2C of warming.\n\n“It’s the first time we’ve ever seen such an event in our computer predictions,” said the Met Office’s Adam Scaife.\n\n“It is shocking” and “that probability is going to rise”.\n\nHe recalled that a decade ago, forecasts first showed the very low probability of a calendar year exceeding the 1.5C benchmark. But that came to pass in 2024.\n\n‘Dangerous’ level of warming\n\nEvery fraction of a degree of additional warming can intensify heatwaves, extreme precipitation, droughts, and the melting of ice caps, sea ice and glaciers.\n\nThis year’s climate is offering no respite.\n\nLast week, China recorded temperatures exceeding 40C (104 degrees Fahrenheit) in some areas, the United Arab Emirates hit nearly 52C (126F), and Pakistan was buffeted by deadly winds following an intense heatwave.\n\n“We’ve already hit a dangerous level of warming,” with recent “deadly floods in Australia, France, Algeria, India, China and Ghana, wildfires in Canada,” said climatologist Friederike Otto of Imperial College London. “Relying on oil, gas and coal in 2025 is total lunacy.”\n\nDavide Faranda, from France’s CNRS National Centre for Scientific Research, added: “The science is unequivocal: to have any hope of staying within a safe climate window, we must urgently cut fossil fuel emissions and accelerate the transition to clean energy.”\n\nArctic warming is predicted to continue to outstrip the global average over the next five years, said the WMO.\n\nSea ice predictions for 2025-2029 suggest further reductions in the Barents Sea, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk.\n\nForecasts suggest South Asia will be wetter than average across the next five years.\n\nAnd precipitation patterns suggest wetter than average conditions in the Sahel, northern Europe, Alaska and northern Siberia, and drier than average conditions over the Amazon.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
