But I don’t know if it can be both. My personal opinion,” Musk said in the interview, which will be aired in full on Sunday.\n\nThe White House sought to play down any differences over US government spending, without directly naming Musk.\n\n“The Big Beautiful Bill is NOT an annual budget bill,” Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller said on Musk’s social network, X, after the tech titan’s comments aired.\n\nAll DOGE cuts would have to be carried out through a separate bill targeting the federal bureaucracy, according to US Senate rules, Miller added.\n\nBut Musk’s comments represented a rare split with the Republican president whom he helped propel back to power, as the largest donor to his 2024 election campaign.\n\nTrump tasked Musk with cutting government spending as head of DOGE, but after a feverish start, Musk announced in late April he was mostly stepping back to run his companies again.\n\nMusk complained in a separate interview with the Washington Post that DOGE, which operated out of the White House with a staff of young technicians, had become a lightning rod for criticism.\n\n“DOGE is just becoming the whipping boy for everything,” Musk told the newspaper at the Starbase launch site in Texas ahead of Space X’s latest launch on Tuesday.\n\n“Something bad would happen anywhere, and we would get blamed for it even if we had nothing to do with it.”\n\nMusk blamed entrenched US bureaucracy for DOGE’s failure to achieve all of its goals — although reports say his domineering style and lack of familiarity with the currents of Washington politics were also major factors.\n\n“The federal bureaucracy situation is much worse than I realised,” he said. “I thought there were problems, but it sure is an uphill battle trying to improve things in DC, to say the least.”\n\nMusk has previously admitted that he did not achieve all his goals with DOGE even though tens of thousands of people were removed from government payrolls and several departments were gutted or shut down.\n\nMusk’s own businesses suffered in the meantime.\n\nProtesters against the cost-cutting targeted Tesla dealerships while arsonists even torched a few of the electric vehicles, and the firm’s profits slumped.\n\n“People were burning Teslas. Why would you do that? That’s really uncool,” Musk told the Post.\n\nMusk has also been focusing on Space X after a series of fiery setbacks to his dreams of colonising Mars — the latest of which came on Tuesday when its prototype Starship exploded over the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe tycoon last week also said he would pull back from spending his fortune on politics, having spent around a quarter of a billion dollars to support Trump.",
