  "content": "A Sri Lankan court on Thursday sentenced two former ministers from the government of deposed president Gotabaya Rajapaksa to decades in prison in a landmark corruption case.\n\nEx-sports minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage and former trade minister Nalin Fernando were found guilty by the Colombo High Court of misappropriating 53 million Sri Lankan rupees ($177,000) of state funds.\n\nThe pair were also fined $2,000 for using government money to donate board games — including 14,000 carrom boards and 11,000 draughts sets — in an attempt to boost the failed 2015 re-election bid of Gotabaya’s elder brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa.\n\nAluthgamage was sentenced to 20 years in jail. Fernando was sentenced to 25 years.\n\nAluthgamage is now the most senior member of a Rajapaksa-led cabinet to be successfully prosecuted for corruption.\n\nThe cases against both men were initiated six years ago, when the Rajapaksa brothers were out of power, but the case had been making slow headway until a new government took office last year.\n\nAluthgamage also faces a separate investigation into allegations that he authorised in 2022 a payment of $6.09m to a Chinese supplier for a fertiliser shipment that was never delivered.\n\nHe caused a stir in 2020 when he accused Sri Lanka’s national cricket team of rigging the 2011 World Cup final in favour of India, triggering an investigation that ultimately failed to substantiate his claims.\n\nAluthgamage, who served as sports minister from 2010 to 2015, said in June 2020 that he had “not wanted to disclose” the alleged match-fixing plot at the time.\n\n“In 2011, we were supposed to win, but we sold the match. I feel I can talk about it now. I am not implicating players, but certain sections were involved,” he said.\n\nSri Lanka lost the final at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium by six wickets. Both Indian and Sri Lankan players have strongly denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the former trade minister’s name as Anil Fernando, who is the incumbent labour minister. The story has been revised to reflect that the minister’s name is Nalin Fernando.",
