  "content": "UNITED NATIONS: Palestinians living in Gaza “deserve more than survival”, the United Nations envoy for the Middle East told the Security Council on Wednesday, as Israel’s bombardment entered its 600th day.\n\nIsrael stepped up its military offensive in Gaza earlier this month, while mediators push for an end to hostilities that remains elusive.\n\nThe issue of aid has come sharply into focus amid a hunger crisis after Israel imposed a full blockade on Gaza for over two months, before allowing supplies in at a trickle last week.\n\n“Since the resumption of hostilities in Gaza, the already horrific existence of civilians has only sunk further into the abyss. This is man-made,” Sigrid Kaag, the United Nations Special Coordinator for the Middle East, told the Council.\n\nUS surgeon says Gaza’s health network has been systematically dismantled in a ‘sustained military campaign’\n\n“Death is their companion,” she continued. “It’s not life, it’s not hope. The people of Gaza deserve more than survival. They deserve a future.”\n\nThe aid that is now coming in “is comparable to a lifeboat after the ship has sunk”, she said.\n\nKaag warned that there could be no “sustainable peace” in the Middle East without a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, adding that the occupied West Bank also is on a “dangerous trajectory”. And she called for collective action to revive a two-state solution, saying that a high-level international conference next month presents a “critical opportunity”.\n\n“It must launch a concrete path towards ending the occupation and realising the two-state solution,” she said.\n\nWhen speaking of people in Gaza, “the words empathy, solidarity and support have lost their meaning”, Kaag said.\n\n“We should not become accustomed to the number of people killed or injured. These are daughters, mothers, and young children whose lives have been shattered. All have a name, all had a future, all had dreams and aspirations.”\n\n`Why didn’t I die?’\n\nThe UN Security Council also heard the harrowing testimony of an American surgeon on Wednesday, a few weeks after his return from Gaza.\n\n“I am here because I have witnessed what is happening in Gaza with my own eyes, especially to children, and I cannot pretend not to have seen it. You too, cannot claim ignorance,” said Dr Feroze Sidhwa.\n\nThe medical system in Gaza has not failed, he said. “It has been systematically dismantled through a sustained military campaign that has wilfully violated international humanitarian law.”\n\nChildren are “supposed to be protected”, he said, but “in Gaza, those protections are simply gone”.\n\n“Most of my patients were pre-teen children, their bodies shattered by explosions and torn by flying metal. Many died. Those who lived often awoke to find their entire families gone,” he said.\n\n“According to the War Child Alliance, nearly half of Gaza’s children are suicidal,” he said.\n\n“They ask, why didn’t I die with my sister, my mother, my father? Not out of extremism, but out of unbearable grief. I wonder if any member of this Council has ever met a five-year-old child who no longer wants to live.” The Israeli ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, blamed Hamas for the situation in Gaza.\n\n“There is suffering in Gaza, but the blame is on the shoulders of Hamas … so they will continue to be suffering until Hamas understands that they will not stay in Gaza,” he told reporters.\n\nIsrael claims killing Sinwar’s brother\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Mohammad Sinwar, Hamas’s Gaza chief and younger brother of the Palestinian group’s deceased leader Yahya Sinwar, had been killed in an air strike last week.\n\nMohammad Sinwar had been the target of an Israeli strike on a hospital in southern Gaza and Netanyahu said on May 21 that it was likely he was dead.\n\nThe Israeli leader announced that Sinwar had been “eliminated” in an address to the Israeli parliament as he listed off names of other Hamas officials that Israel claimed it had killed over the past 20 months.\n\n“In the last two days we have been in a dramatic turn towards a complete defeat of Hamas,” he said, adding that Israel was also “taking control of food distribution”, a reference to the new aid distribution system in Gaza managed by a US-backed group.\n\nHamas has yet to confirm Sinwar’s death.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
