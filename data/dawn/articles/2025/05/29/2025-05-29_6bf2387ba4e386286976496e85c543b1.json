However, they lamented that no action had been taken on the document to date.\n\n“Refugees will no longer tolerate exploitation, nor will there be any compromise on the future of our younger generation,” the communiqué warned.\n\nThe group stressed that allocation of two separate seats for post-1989 refugees would help them elect their own representatives to advocate their concerns and contribute meaningfully to the discourse on India’s human rights violations in occupied Kashmir.\n\nThe refugees also reminded Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of the commitments he made during previous meetings. These included a Rs1,500 increase in the monthly subsistence allowance and concrete steps towards their resettlement.\n\nThe group communiqué congratulated the government of Pakistan, the armed forces and Field Marshal Asim Munir on the success of Operation Bunyanum Marsoos against Indian aggression.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
