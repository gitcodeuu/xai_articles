  "content": "LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has expressed strong displeasure over the rise in chicken prices in the province directing the relevant departments to take prompt steps to control them.\n\nShe was presiding over a meeting on the hike in the prices of chicken.\n\nShe directed the relevant departments to also closely monitor the prices of essential vegetables, including tomatoes, onions, ginger, garlic, green chillies and lemons ahead of Eidul Azha.\n\nShe asserted that an increase in the prices of essential vegetables before the arrival of Eidul Azha was unacceptable. She said the rise in chicken prices despite the presence of government institutions was highly unacceptable.\n\nThe CM directed to take immediate measures to reduce the price of ‘roti’ in view of recent reduction in the flour prices.\n\nShe also sought a comprehensive plan to cut down transportation costs of vegetables and directed the agriculture department to take essential steps to grow off-season vegetables as well.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
