The event was moderated by HRCP’s Qazi Khizar.\n\nAt the outset, economics expert and academic Dr Asim Bashir gave a detailed presentation on Sindh’s education budget and issues related to primary and higher education.\n\nHe said that the decision to appoint bureaucrats as vice chancellors of universities in Sindh could affect academic freedom in several ways and undermine the quality of education.\n\nHe noted that there are significant differences between the academic backgrounds, training and work methods of bureaucrats and academics. Therefore, appointing bureaucrats to lead academic institutions is inappropriate, he argued.\n\nHe added that in developed countries, there are no instances of bureaucrats heading higher education institutions. On the contrary, it is often academics and subject experts who are appointed to lead state institutions and even take on bureaucratic roles.\n\nDr Akhtiar Ghumro, vice president of the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association, criticised the procedures, tests and interviews involved in the selection of vice chancellors. He claimed that these appointments are largely driven by “political influence and favouritism rather than merit.” He also claimed that no vice chancellor is appointed without clearance from security agencies.\n\nDr Ghumro also criticised the Sindh government’s decision to make contractual appointments in higher education institutions. He said such a system would foster obedience and compliance rather than critical thinking and dissent — and without dissent, there can be no freedom of speech or formation of independent organisations.\n\nProf Dr Arfana Mallah from Sindh University said that policy debates related to education and intellectual growth have become rare and faculty members are increasingly preoccupied with concerns over salaries, pensions and financial survival due to the worsening situation.\n\nShe criticised the Higher Education Commission (HEC), saying it withholds funding and grants for universities that do not seek prior approval for organising conferences on specific topics or inviting specific speakers. She added that critical and intellectual conferences are not encouraged, but rather denied funding.\n\nShe also said that the Pakistan Peoples Party, despite claiming to uphold democratic values, has not lifted the ban on student organisations. Given the current situation, she warned, even teachers’ associations might face restrictions in the future.\n\nSenator Masroor Ahsan, a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, said that there has been a long-standing struggle to lift the ban on student unions. Despite persistent efforts, no progress has been made so far. However, he said that the struggle would continue. He emphasised that student unions have historically produced strong political leadership, and therefore, the ban should be lifted.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr Riaz Sheikh, dean of the faculty of social sciences at SZABIST, warned that if the current situation persists, universities will no longer be spaces where critical thinking and reason can flourish.\n\nHe emphasised that economic and financial autonomy is essential for academic freedom, yet universities across the country are facing severe financial crises.\n\nHe said that some selected universities in certain cities receive disproportionate funding from the HEC, while others are neglected. This disparity, he said, must be investigated.\n\nHe also raised concerns about HEC policies and curriculum, particularly in religious studies, which he said are fostering discrimination among religious groups within the country. Therefore, he called for nationwide unity to stand against the worsening situation in academia.\n\nDr Tauseef Ahmed Khan, convener of the retired teachers’ committee at the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology (FUUAST), said that at his own institution, the university administration — particularly the vice chancellor — is withholding pensions and other dues of retired employees, despite sufficient funds being available in the university’s accounts.\n\nHe said financially distressed universities are likely to struggle with academic freedom, as the lack of financial autonomy hampers both intellectual and academic activities.\n\nProf Roshan Ali Soomro of the FUUAST lamented that pensions and other dues remain unpaid and despite letters sent to the President of Pakistan, there has been no response. He said that when teachers question Vice Chancellor Dr Zabta Khan Shinwari about the pending payments, he responds dismissively and asks how any teacher can question him.\n\nHRCP Chairperson Asad Iqbal Butt said that public participation and opinion have never been considered in state policymaking and national debates. As a result, he said, the country faces anarchy and chaos.\n\nHe said the education budget in Pakistan is already inadequate but the allocation for research is even lower. He questioned how the state and its institutions could be expected to function effectively or evolve without investment in research.\n\nHe added that spending only 2 per cent of the budget on education is like continuing to produce clerks, as was the focus under British colonial rule but unfortunately, that same outdated education system persists today. “Nations do not progress like this,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
