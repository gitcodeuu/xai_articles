  "content": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he had told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to hold off from striking Iran as he voiced optimism about nuclear talks his administration is holding with Tehran.\n\nIran said that it may consider allowing Americans to inspect its facilities as part of the United Nations nuclear watchdog if a deal is reached. Trump, asked if he had told Netanyahu in a call last week not to take any action that could disrupt the diplomacy, said: “Well, I’d like to be honest, yes I did.”\n\nPressed on what he told the Israeli premier, Trump replied: “I just said I don’t think it’s appropriate, we’re having very good discussions with them.” He added: “I told him this would be inappropriate to do right now because we’re very close to a solution.\n\n“I think they want to make a deal, and if we can make a deal, save a lot of lives.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 29th, 2025",
