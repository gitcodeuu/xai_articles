She was released from custody after a federal judge granted her bail.\n\nTrump’s critics have said the administration’s actions are an attack on free speech rights under the First Amendment of the US Constitution.\n\nWhile the new directive allows posts to resume scheduling for student and exchange visa applicants, it warns the officers that there may have to be fewer appointments due to the demands of more extensive vetting.\n\n“Posts should consider overall scheduling volume and the resource demands of appropriate vetting; posts might need to schedule fewer FMJ cases than they did previously,” the cable said, referring to the relevant visa types.\n\nThe directive has also asked posts to prioritise among expedited visa appointments of foreign-born physicians participating in a medical programme through exchange visas, as well as student applicants looking to study in a US university where international students constitute less than 15 per cent of the total.\n\nAt Harvard, the oldest and wealthiest US university, on which the administration has launched a multifront attack by freezing its billions of dollars of grants and other funding, foreign students last year made up about 27pc of the total student population.\n\nThe cable is asking the overseas posts to implement these vetting procedures within five business days.",
