  "content": "QUETTA: Senior politician and former senator Nawabzada Lashkari Raisani announced on Sunday he would challenge the recently passed Balochistan Mines and Minerals Act 2025 in the Balochistan High Court.\n\nThe decision was made during a consultative meeting of senior lawyers at Sarawan House, where legal and constitutional aspects of the act were reviewed, leading to a suggestion to file a petition against it in the BHC.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr Raisani strongly criticised the act, calling it a “blatant robbery” of the rights of the people of Balochistan.\n\n“This law, passed by the Balochistan Assembly, is an assault on the province’s rightful claim over its resources, and we will challenge it on every platform,” he said.\n\nMr Raisani further said that while Balochistan’s people have struggled for seven decades to gain control over their resources, this legislation “has once again handed that control back to the federal authorities and capitalist entities”.\n\nHe urged all political parties in the province to unite and collectively oppose this law.\n\nHe also called on trade unions, bar associations, business organisations, the Chamber of Commerce and the Mines Owners Association to join the movement to defend Balochistan’s resources.\n\n“Only through collective struggle can the people of Balochistan secure their rightful ownership and protect their interests,” Mr Raisani emphasised.\n\nThe meeting concluded that the Balochistan Mines and Minerals Act undermines the rights of the province’s people and aims to deprive locals of their ownership of natural resources.\n\nProminent lawyers, political representatives and civil society members attended the meeting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 23rd, 2025",
