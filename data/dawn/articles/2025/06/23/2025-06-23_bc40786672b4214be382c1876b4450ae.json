  "content": "LAHORE: The Punjab Police have launched a self-service kiosk in a shopping mall of Burewala in district Vehari to enable women to avail essential police services out of the police station buildings without interacting with the policemen.\n\nThe facility was launched keeping in view some reports that the women of the underdeveloped districts were more vulnerable to violence, particularly in rural areas of south Punjab, due to lower literacy rate and the local traditions of avoiding interaction with the male staff.\n\nThe police authorities have declared it a major leap towards citizen-friendly policing and launched the first ‘self-service kiosk’ of the Police Khidmat Markaz (PKM) in a shopping mall of Burewala. They are of the view that in a conservative setting, such innovation holds special significance. The facility would offer women and also elderly persons a safe, respectful and independent way to engage with police services.\n\nVehari District Police Officer (DPO) Mohammad Afzal declared the self-service kiosk a first in a series of kiosks planned across the district, aimed at making essential police services more accessible, especially to women and the elderly.\n\nLocated some 100km away from Multan, he said, the district had three subdivisions and nearly 20 police stations.\n\nHe added that with this initiative, Vehari police had set a new benchmark for community-oriented, technology-enabled policing.\n\n“It would provide the complete suite of services, including character certificates, FIR copies, tenant and employee registration, vehicle verification, report of lost documents, and more—all without needing to visit a police station,” Mr Afzal said and added that the initiative would bring police services directly into public spaces, combining convenience with security and privacy.\n\n“Placed strategically inside a bustling shopping mall, the kiosk is designed to cater to families and individuals during regular shopping hours,” Mr Afzal said.\n\nHe added that the move would reduce unnecessary visits of the local women and elderly people to the police stations and they would avail of hassle-free services from the civilian staff deputed by the police department.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 23rd, 2025",
