Its military said fighter jets struck “dozens” of military targets across western and central Iran, including missile launchers, the “Imam Hussein” Strategic Missile Command Centre in Yazd and sites in Bushehr, Ahvaz, and Isfahan.\n\nIsrael’s military also claimed it downed two Iranian F-5 fighter jets at Dezful airport.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 23rd, 2025",
