And yet, we now risk descending into a rathole of retaliation after retaliation. To avoid it, diplomacy must prevail. Civilians must be protected. Safe maritime navigation must be guaranteed.”\n\nMr Guterres emphasised that peace efforts must not be abandoned: “We cannot and must not give up on peace.” He urged member states to take “immediate, decisive action to end fighting” and to commit to meaningful dialogue.\n\nThe emergency session was convened at Iran’s request and backed by Pakistan, which described its initiative as “a principled stand to uphold international law and protect regional stability”.\n\nDraft resolution\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Pakistan, China and Russia have tabled a draft resolution calling for de-escalation and protection of Iran’s nuclear infrastructure. Although the draft was not scheduled for vote during Sunday’s emergency session, it lays the groundwork for a broader diplomatic push.\n\nReaffirming the UN Charter and the prohibition on the use of force, the draft “condemns in the strongest terms the attacks against peaceful nuclear sites and facilities under IAEA safeguards in the Islamic Republic of Iran” and warns such strikes “represent a grave threat to international peace and security”.\n\nThe resolution further calls for “an immediate and unconditional ceasefire” and urges all parties to “refrain from further escalation”. It places particular emphasis on the “urgent protection of civilians and civilian infrastructure,” reminding all parties of their obligations under international law.\n\nSignificantly, the draft urges the resumption of diplomatic negotiations over Iran’s nuclear programme, pushing for an agreement that ensures the programme remains “exclusively peaceful”. In exchange, it demands the “complete lifting of all sanctions — both multilateral and unilateral — a clause that aligns with Iran’s longstanding demands and is expected to face resistance from Western members of the Council.\n\nCalls for urgent diplomacy\n\nBriefing the Council, Miroslav Jena, UN’s Assistant Secretary-General for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, said: “The world will also not be spared from the ramifications of this dangerous conflict … This latest development must be viewed with the utmost seriousness. It marks a dangerous escalation in a conflict that has already devastated many lives in both countries, in a region on the edge.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 23rd, 2025",
