  "content": "Washington: Israel is running low on defensive “Arrow” missile interceptors, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing an unnamed US official, raising concerns about the country’s ability to counter long-range ballistic missiles from Iran.\n\nThe official said Washington has been aware of the issue for months and has been bolstering Israel’s defenses on the ground, at sea, and in the air.\n\nAccording to the report, since the war with Iran began, the Pentagon has deployed additional ballistic missile defence systems to Israel, and Washington may also begin using its own interceptors. In response to the Journal, the Israel Defence Forces said it is “prepared and ready to handle any scenario,” but added that it is “unable to comment on matters related to munitions.”\n\nThe official said Washington has been aware of the issue for months and has been bolstering Israel’s defences on the ground, at sea, and in the air.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 19th, 2025",
