He revealed that he had spoken to Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan about the situation.\n\nHe described the scenes in Gaza as heartbreaking, noting that over 50,000 innocent Palestinians had been killed. “Brutality is being unleashed. When will the world’s conscience awaken?” he asked.\n\nThe prime minister informed the cabinet that Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar would attend the OIC foreign ministers’ meeting in Turkiye on June 21-22.\n\nAs for economic measures, the premier said the government had convinced the International Monetary Fund not to impose taxes on the agricultural sector, including fertiliser and pesticides, stressing that farmers were already under strain. He expressed gratitude to the IMF for agreeing to the request.\n\nWithout naming the PTI government, PM Shehbaz said the incumbent government did not act like those who had broken the promises (with the IMF) and took the country to the verge of default. He said his administration had averted a financial crisis and was steering Pakistan towards economic stability.\n\nHe also praised a delegation led by Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for effectively representing Pakistan’s position on Indian unilateral actions during visits to the US and Europe.\n\nPower sector debt plan\n\nMeanwhile, in a key decision, the federal cabinet approved Pakistan’s largest financial scheme to stabilise the power sector by eliminating Rs1.275tr in circular debt over the next six years, without adding burden to the national budget.\n\nUnder the plan, Rs683 billion of Power Holding Company’s debt will be refinanced, and outstanding payments to independent power producers (IPPs) will be settled. The scheme aims to implement sustainable reforms, ease financial stress and restore investor confidence in the energy sector.\n\nThe prime minister commended Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir for his recent address to the Pakistani diaspora in the US, calling his commitment to safeguarding Pakistan’s interests a source of national pride.\n\nThe cabinet also expressed appreciation for Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb and his economic team for presenting a “people-friendly budget” for the upcoming fiscal year. Commendation was also extended to Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Yousaf for the arrangements made for Haj pilgrims this year.\n\nThe cabinet also approved the appointment of Kamaluddin Tipu as the chairman of the Commission for the Protection of Journalists and Media Professionals, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Human Rights.\n\nAdditionally, the cabinet granted an exemption under Section 21 of the Pakistan Public Procurement Regulatory Authority Ordinance 2002 to the National Power Parks Management Company Limited for procurement services related to the acquisition of the Rousch Power Plant.\n\nIt also ratified the decisions made during the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases meeting held on May 21.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 19th, 2025",
