As one peeped out the window in the night, you could see drones, missiles with fire tails,” he told AFP.\n\nPakistan and Iran have a shaky diplomatic relationship. Last year, Pakistan launched strikes in retaliation against targets within Iranian territory, after Tehran said it struck the bases of another group within Pakistani territory. However, officials from both countries soon engaged in conciliatory overtures, signalling a mutual interest in de-escalating.\n\nDespite the back and forth, there has been no suspension of trade, tourism and academic ties from either side.\n\nIranian consulates across Pakistan have stepped up efforts to promote their universities.\n\nBetween 25 million and 35m Shia Muslims also hope to make at least one pilgrimage in their lifetime to holy sites in Iran, foremost among them the sacred city of Qom.\n\nMohammad Khalil, a 41 year old petroleum engineer, left Tehran three days ago, the capital of the Islamic Republic, looking like a ghost town as residents sheltered indoors and families fled.\n\n“In the last two days, I saw people moving out of the city in different vehicles with necessary commodities,” Khalil said.\n\nAbdul Ghani Khan sells medical equipment in his hometown of Peshawar in northwest Pakistan and travels to Iran regularly for supplies.\n\nHe had been in Tehran for a week when the first Israeli missiles fell on Friday. Iran and Israel have traded heavy missile fire in the days since, raising fears of a wider regional conflict.\n\nPakistan is in a difficult position as the only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons. It, like Iran, does not recognise Israel but is also a major ally of the United States.\n\nKhan had to make the journey home by road because the airspace is now closed. Pakistan has also shut its border crossings with Iran to all except Pakistanis wanting to return home.\n\n“We saw drones, red lights of anti-aircraft guns and I spotted one building catch fire,” Khan said.\n\nMohammad Asif, a lawyer from Lahore, heard about the air strikes while on a pilgrimage in Qom.\n\nHe wasn’t initially afraid and continued his pilgrimage to Mashhad in Iran’s northeast, home to the golden-domed Imam Reza shrine.\n\nThat was until Israeli strikes hit the airport in Mashhad, nearly 1,000 kilometres from the Pakistan border.\n\nSamreen Ali was also in Mashhad but, like Asif, cut her trip short and returned with her husband and 15-year-old son.\n\nShe was praying in a mosque in Mashhad when Israel struck the city.\n\nAli said she had visited Iran nine times before on pilgrimages and never imagined witnessing war there.\n\n“I was offering prayer when I heard two explosions,” she told AFP.\n\nShe then noticed she wasn’t receiving messages on her phone and assumed that “communication was being restricted … because of the war”.\n\nSyed Saqib, 46, was in Qom and had to travel 500km by bus southeast to Yazd.\n\n“We had to take alternative routes, spend an entire night waiting at a bus terminal,” Saqib said.\n\nThey then boarded buses to Zahedan, a city near the border with Balochistan. A relieved Saqib recalled crossing the border at Taftan, surrounded by families carrying heavy luggage.",
