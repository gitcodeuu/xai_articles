  "content": "One of tech billionaire Elon Musk’s SpaceX Starships exploded during a routine test in Texas late on Wednesday, law enforcement said according to AFP, adding that no one was injured.\n\nThe Starship 36 suffered “catastrophic failure and exploded” at the Starbase launch facility shortly after 11pm (9am PKT Thursday), a Facebook post by the Cameron County authorities said.\n\nMusk’s SpaceX said the rocket was preparing for the tenth flight test when it “experienced a major anomaly while on a test stand at Starbase”.\n\n“A safety clear area around the site was maintained throughout the operation and all personnel are safe and accounted for,” SpaceX added on social media.\n\n“There are no hazards to residents in surrounding communities, and we ask that individuals do not attempt to approach the area while safing operations continue.”\n\nStarbase, on the south Texas coast near the border with Mexico, is the headquarters for Musk’s space project.\n\nStanding 123 metres tall, Starship is the world’s largest and most powerful rocket and central to Musk’s long-term vision of colonising Mars.\n\nThe latest setback follows an explosion of a prototype Starship over the Indian Ocean in late May.\n\nThe biggest and most powerful launch vehicle ever built had lifted off on May 27 from the Starbase facility, but the first-stage Super Heavy booster blew up instead of executing its planned splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nThe previous two outings also ended poorly, with the upper stage disintegrating over the Caribbean.",
