  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI has criticised the government for obstructing its viewpoint during the budget debate and accused it of failing to take a firm stance against Israeli war crimes.\n\nSpeaking to the media at Parlia­m­ent House, former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser, Leader of the Opposition Omar Ayub Khan, Barris­ter Ali Zafar, Zartaj Gul Wazir, Aamir Dogar and other PTI leaders alleged that state-run PTV was not airing their speeches during the bud­get debate, despite giving full live coverage to government representatives.\n\nMr Qaiser said it was reg­rettable that PTI leaders had been facing legal cases for two years without resolution.\n\n“Dr Yasmin Rashid is a cancer patient, but even her challan has not been submitted. Production orders have been issued for PTI legislators such as Senator Ejaz Cha­udhry, but they are not being implemented,” he said. He urged Senate Chairm­­an Yousuf Raza Gillani to show courage as his production order was not being implemented.\n\nBarrister Ali Zafar said that the Senate chairman’s credibility was at stake as his orders were not being respected. He alleged that false cases, such as the cipher case, were being registered against the PTI leadership.\n\nMs Wazir alleged that the government continued oppression against women, claiming that Bushra Bibi was being targeted merely for being the wife of PTI founder Imran Khan.\n\nShe alleged that a delegation was sent abroad for luxury and entertainment rather than defending Pakistan’s case.\n\nOmar Ayub Khan labelled the budget process itself as flawed and lacking transparency.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 19th, 2025",
