The aim was to attract renowned consultancy firms, explore emerging technology courses and discuss student exchange programmes with foreign universities.\n\nAccording to officials, 12 international consultancy firms, mainly from Turkiye and China, and three local firms participated in the bidding process.\n\nSources said bids were opened on June 16 and the evaluation process was currently under way.\n\nThe lowest bidder will finalise the project design and oversee its implementation.\n\nThe meeting was further informed that the university’s charter had been finalised by the education ministry and shared with the Planning Commission for vetting. The trust deed has also been prepared and is currently being vetted.\n\nMeanwhile, a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reiterated that providing equal educational and developmental opportunities to economically disadvantaged children remained one of the government’s top priorities.\n\nHe directed that educational facilities in Daanish schools and the university project should align with international standards.\n\nThe prime minister also called for the establishment of a world-class digital library as part of the project.\n\nHe further directed the provision of smart boards, e-libraries and other modern facilities in all Daanish schools to meet contemporary educational needs.\n\nIt is relevant to note that the federal government is constructing five Daanish schools in Balochistan, one in Karachi, three in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, three in Chitral and three in Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nThe Daanish University is being constructed using the £190 million returned to Pakistan by the UK government after it was seized from a Pakistani property tycoon.\n\nPart of this amount will fund the university, while the remaining funds will be spent on other educational initiatives. Additionally, a portion of the tobacco levy will be used mainly for the university’s running costs.\n\nThe prime minister has called for early completion of the project.\n\nDuring a visit to the university site in Islamabad’s Sector H-16 in March, he stressed the need to expedite pre-construction work.\n\nHe had also expressed the hope that the university would become a model institution in Pakistan and achieve global recognition for the quality of its education, research, and focus on applied sciences.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 19th, 2025",
