The worst-hit areas included Palitana and Jesar towns, which on Tuesday registered 867 millimetres of rain over the past 24 hours.\n\nState relief commissioner Alok Kumar Pandey said the first 18 deaths recorded were the result of storms, lightning strikes, and structural collapses due to rough weather.\n\n“The state is fully geared to handle the situation, and inter-departmental coordination is being intensified to ensure swift relief and rescue operations,” Pandey said. Those rescued included 18 farm labourers who were trapped in mango orchards in the Gadhada area, and 22 people in the Surendranagar district where waters from an overflowing river gushed into their homes.\n\nIndia’s annual monsoon season from June to September offers respite from the intense summer heat and is crucial for replenishing water supplies. But scores of people die each year during the rainy season due to flash floods and landslides across India, a country of 1.4 billion people.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 19th, 2025",
