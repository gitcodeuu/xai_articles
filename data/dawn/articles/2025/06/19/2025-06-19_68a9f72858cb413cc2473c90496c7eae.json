  "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: In a pulsating contest at the National Hockey Stadium on Wednesday, Pakistan’s hopes of reaching the semi-finals of the FIH Nations Cup remained intact despite a heart-wrenching 4-3 defeat at the hands of table-toppers New Zealand in their final Pool ‘B’ outing.\n\nWith qualification hanging in the balance, the Green Shirts knew that a victory would seal their progression. However, they were up against a New Zealand side that had exhibited perfect form throughout the group stage, collecting maximum points from their previous encounters.\n\nThe match got off to a frenetic start, with the Blacksticks drawing first blood in the seventh minute. Awarded the first penalty corner of the game, New Zealand capitalised swiftly through Nic Woods, whose well-placed drag-flick pierced the Pakistani defence, sneaking past the left-post guard.\n\nStung by the early setback, Pakistan responded with admirable urgency and determination. Their resurgence began in the dying moments of the first quarter. Abdul Rehman, who had been in sharp form throughout the tournament, restored parity with a ferocious drag-flick that rattled into the top corner of the net, leaving the Kiwi goalkeeper stranded. Barely a minute had passed before Rehman struck again, capitalising on a defensive error to slam home from close range and turn the game on its head.\n\nPakistan’s dominance continued into the second quarter. As the half-time whistle loomed, Rana Waheed Ashraf extended the lead, delicately guiding the ball past the line in a move reminiscent of Rehman’s poise. At 3-1, the Green Shirts seemed poised for a famous victory and a clear path to the semi-finals.\n\nHowever, the second half belonged entirely to New Zealand — and, more specifically, to their talismanic drag-flicker Scott Cosslett. The Blacksticks earned six penalty corners in quick succession, putting Pakistan under sustained pressure. Cosslett struck twice with carbon-copy precision, both times targeting the bottom left corner, to bring the Kiwis level before the end of the third quarter.\n\nWith the momentum now squarely in their favour, New Zealand kept probing, and their efforts bore fruit in the final quarter. Cosslett, growing in confidence, stepped up once more and completed a stunning hat-trick — this time with a slightly lofted drag-flick that rippled the net, sealing a remarkable comeback and preserving New Zealand’s perfect record in the group stage.\n\n“I think we’ve shown great composure throughout the tournament,” Cosslett said after being named Player of the Match. “We’ve been a little slow to start, but we trust our processes, and full credit to the lads for turning things around once again.”\n\nPakistan, meanwhile, were left to anxiously await the outcome of the final Pool ‘B’ fixture between Malaysia and Japan. The equation was simple: had Malaysia defeated Japan by two or more goals, Pakistan would have been eliminated. But fate favoured the Green Shirts as Japan triumphed 2-1, confirming Pakistan’s place in the last four.\n\nDespite the defeat, Pakistan’s earlier performances — a spirited win over Japan and a gritty draw against hosts Malaysia — proved sufficient to secure second place in the pool and a berth in the semi-finals.\n\nThe semi-finals are scheduled for June 20, with the final and third-place play-off slated for the following day. The tournament holds high stakes as the winner earns promotion to the elite FIH Hockey Pro League for the 2025–26 season.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 19th, 2025",
