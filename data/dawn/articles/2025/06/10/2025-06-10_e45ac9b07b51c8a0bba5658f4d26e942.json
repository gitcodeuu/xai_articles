He said that the temperature was more than five degrees Celsius above Islamabad’s normal temperature that hovers around 39°C during June.\n\nDue to the heat, dozens of patients were reported in hospitals, while many residents flocked to nearby water reservoirs to beat the heat. However, people complained about frequent power cuts, which added to their misery.\n\n“I wonder when we will have enough electricity. This is just getting too much for us to bear,” said Furqan Ahmad, a resident of Shah Khalid Colony. He said that the area around the old airport was affected most due to power cuts.\n\nOn the other hand, doctors urged the public to take precautions to cope with the heatwave. They advised direct sun exposure and maximum intake of water or ‘Lassi’ to prevent dehydration. They also advised farmers, labourers and other people working outdoors to work as early as possible in the morning.\n\nThey also advised against eating raw or overripe fruits and vegetables that may cause diarrhoea.\n\nIn light of the intense heat, the Met office had issued a weather advisory last week. Under the influence of the current meteorological conditions, the day temperature is likely to remain 5-7°C above normal in upper half (central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan) from June 7 to 12.\n\nIt also asked the elderly and the children to take precautionary measures and avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the day as well as keep hydrated.\n\nAs Rawalpindi sizzled during the day, the district administration made arrangements to deal with the heatstroke cases and decided to establish special camps to provide relief to citizens.\n\n“The camps will be established in different areas of the garrison city from Sunday. These camps will be installed in Shamsabad Park, Kutchery Chowk, Raja Bazaar, Saddar, Pirwadhai Bus Stand, and other areas,” said Deputy Commissioner Waqar Hassan Cheema while talking to Dawn.\n\nHe said cold water and fans, besides first aid, would be available at these camps, adding that the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation and Civil Defence Volunteers would be deployed at these camps from 12pm till evening.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 10th, 2025",
