  "content": "KARACHI: In a rare display of unanimous outrage, Karachi’s opposition parties — the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI), Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) — have strongly condemned Murtaza Wahab-led municipal administration, the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board (SSWMB) and the Pakistan Peoples Party-led government in the province, accused them of “criminal negligence” during Eidul Azha and turning the city into a “garbage dump”.\n\nThe focus of their criticism was a delayed response of the civic authorities in lifting offal of sacrificial animals, which could be seen at almost every nook and cranny of the metropolis during the three days of Eidul Azha.\n\nJI-Karachi chief Monem Zafar strongly criticised the city administration and the SSWMB for leaving Karachi littered with animal offal and a stench that engulfed several areas.\n\nTalking to the media, he held the Sindh government and Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab responsible for the dismal state of sanitation during the festive days and said: “Mayor Wahab makes tall claims, but the reality is visible on every street. He is also chairman of the SSWMB, yet this is the second consecutive year of complete failure in post-Eid cleaning.”\n\nJamaat, Muttahida, PTI accuse SSWMB, city administration of turning Karachi into ‘garbage dump’ on Eid days\n\nThe JI leader pointed out that despite being promised better services, citizens were forced to endure foul smells, clogged drains, and garbage-laden streets. He lamented that towns under the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) lacked authority due to centralisation of powers, preventing effective action at the grassroots level.\n\n“This is deliberate mismanagement,” he said, accusing the PPP-led provincial government of holding onto all administrative control under the 18th Amendment while failing to deliver even basic civic services to the people.\n\n“Karachi has been abandoned during Eid, and the people are paying the price for political incompetence,” he added.\n\nMuttahida condemns SSWMB, JI-led town administrations\n\nThe MQM-P held a press conference at its Bahadurabad headquarters where Opposition Leader in Sindh Assembly, Ali Khurshidi, ripped into the city administration.\n\n“The Eid disaster has exposed the incompetence of the mayor. The Solid Waste Management Board handed out contracts but failed to ensure implementation,” he said while pointing out the disconnect between reported and actual services.\n\n“We were told 96 collection points were set up, but the reality is that stench and filth dominate the cityscape,” he said.\n\nReferring to “widespread corruption”, Mr Khurshidi said that from town offices to the union council level, corruption is rampant and Eid became a money-making season for these institutions.\n\nHe also accused the JI of hypocrisy and said: “Their town chairmen share equal responsibility. JI conveniently blames the PPP while focusing solely on collecting animal hides for fundraising.”\n\nMr Khurshidi further alleged that Murtaza Wahab is extorting Rs225 million from Karachiites under the guise of the Municipal Utility Charges & Taxes (MUCT). “The mayor is busy whitening curbs with marble powder instead of addressing real issues. The city is paying the price for political deals made between the JI and PPP,” he said.\n\nThe leader of the opposition also said that people are being forced to buy water tankers at exorbitant prices. “Is this governance? The mayor should wake up or the people will hold him accountable. This city needs mega projects like the Karachi Circular Railway, not just hollow slogans,” he added.\n\nPTI slams mayor’s performance\n\nEchoing similar criticism, PTI-Sindh President Haleem Adil Sheikh lambasted the mayor’s Eid performance, calling it “a complete failure.”\n\n“Karachi’s roads are filled with animal offal. The stench and filth have become unbearable,” said Mr Sheikh in his statement.\n\n“The so-called mayor, imposed through a stolen mandate, clearly has no concern for the city or its residents.”\n\nHe warned of potential health hazards, saying that incomplete sanitation arrangements can lead to disease outbreaks. This must be addressed on an emergency basis, he added.\n\nHe also blamed the PPP for the deteriorating state of the metropolis.\n\n“The fake opposition leaders remain silent spectators, and those brought to power through Form 47s are oblivious to public suffering,” he said, calling for immediate clean-up operations across the city.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 10th, 2025",
