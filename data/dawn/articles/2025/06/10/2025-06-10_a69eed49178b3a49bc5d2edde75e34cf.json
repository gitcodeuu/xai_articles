A few protesters remained overnight, with some lobbing projectiles and fireworks, according to TV coverage.\n\nTrump called the protesters “insurrectionists”, and demanded authorities arrest people in face masks.\n\n“BRING IN THE TROOPS!!!!” he wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nAt least three self-driving Waymo cars were torched Sunday, and local law enforcement deployed tear gas and smoke grenades to disperse protesters. An Australian reporter was hit in the leg with a rubber bullet fired by a police officer on live television. Her employer later said she was unharmed.\n\nLA police officers set up containment lines to keep demonstrators separated from armed National Guardsmen from the 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team in helmets and camouflage gear. At least 56 people were arrested over two days and three officers suffered minor injuries, they said.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom said he requested the Trump administration withdraw its order to deploy 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles County, calling it unlawful.\n\nNewsom accused Trump of trying to manufacture a crisis and violating California’s state sovereignty. “These are the acts of a dictator, not a President,” he wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe White House disputed Newsom’s characterisation, saying in a statement that “everyone saw the chaos, violence and lawlessness”.\n\nDefence Secretary Pete Hegseth has warned that the Pentagon is prepared to mobilise active-duty troops “if violence continues” in Los Angeles, saying the Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton are “on high alert”. US Northern Command said about 500 Marines were prepared to deploy if ordered.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Karen Bass blamed the Trump administration for inciting tensions by sending in the National Guard, but also condemned protesters who became violent.\n\nMeanwhile, China’s consulate told its citizens in the area to strengthen personal security measures, stay away from gatherings, crowded areas, or places with poor public security, and avoid going out at night or travelling alone. They should also “closely monitor official announcements” and “raise their safety awareness”, it added.\n\nOn the other hand, UN spokesman Farhan Haq said, “We do not want to see any further militarization of this situation, and we encourage the parties at the local, state and federal levels to work to do that.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 10th, 2025",
