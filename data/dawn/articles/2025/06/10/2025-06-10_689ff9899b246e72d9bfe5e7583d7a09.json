However, Islamabad imposed no visa restrictions on Indian Sikhs who can still visit their holy places in the country. From Pakistan’s side, the Kartarpur Corridor is still open, while India closed it for its citizens.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by ETPB Chairman Dr Sajid Mahmood Chauhan, Punjab Minister for Minority Affairs and the Pakistan Sikh Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee head Sardar Ramesh Singh Arora, Additional Secretary Shrines Saif Ullah Khokhar and other senior officials.\n\nDuring the ceremony, a red carpet was laid out at Wagah Border in symbolic anticipation of the arrival of Sikh pilgrims from India.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr Arora said: “Pakistan is second home for the Sikhs, and all arrangements to receive Indian Sikh pilgrims were in place, but they could not come because of the Indian government highhandedness. The Kartarpur Corridor is still open on Pakistan’s side, while the Indian government has closed it.”\n\n“India has brought religion into politics,” the minister said and commented that Modi should not have stopped Indian Sikhs from visiting Pakistan to attend their religious festivals after the ceasefire between the two countries.\n\nMr Khokhar said a red carpet had been laid out for the reception of Indian Sikhs but unfortunately, the Indian government did not allow them to come here.\n\n“Nonetheless, we [will] keep inviting Indian Sikh pilgrims as they are welcome to Pakistan anytime,” he said and hoped that the pilgrims would be allowed to visit Pakistan to attend the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh.\n\nThe ETPB is holding two Sikh events in Lahore this month — the death anniversaries of Guru Arjan Dev Ji (Jor Mela) and Maharaja Ranjit Singh on June 16 and 29, respectively.\n\nThe main ceremony to mark Guru Arjan Dev Ji’s martyrdom, including the Bhog Akhand Path Sahib ritual, will be held on June 16 at Gurdwara Dera Sahib, Lahore.\n\nSimilarly, the main event of the death anniversary of Maharaja Ranjit Singh will be held on June 29 at his samadhi outside the Lahore Fort here.\n\nLast year, over 800 and 450 Indian Sikhs visited Pakistan to attend death anniversaries of Guru Arjan Dev Ji and Maharaja Ranjit Singh, respectively.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 10th, 2025",
