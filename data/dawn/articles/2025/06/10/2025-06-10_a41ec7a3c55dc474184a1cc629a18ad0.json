  "content": "KARACHI: A massive fire that broke out early Sunday morning at a factory in Karachi Export Processing Zone (KEPZ) near Landhi was brought under control by Monday evening after hectic efforts of 36 hours.\n\nThe blaze destroyed three factories completely and left five people injured, including four firefighters who sustained burns and injuries from falling debris, the officials said.\n\nHowever, they added that cooling operations would continue until late Monday night.\n\n“One factory was completely destroyed and collapsed, another is near collapse, while the third also sustained significant damage,” said the Rescue 1122 Chief Operating Officer Dr Abid Jalaluddin Shaikh.\n\nFour firefighters suffer injuries in rescue operation at EPZ; another blaze destroys three warehouses in Mauripur\n\nHe added that the presence of inflammable materials and garments, coupled with wind direction, contributed to the rapid spread of the fire.\n\nDr Shaikh said the fire initially broke out at approximately 4.30am on Sunday in a factory where chemicals were stored. Due to the hazardous nature of the materials, the fire quickly engulfed two adjoining factories.\n\nInitially, the firemen faced considerable difficulties owing to a lack of water supply. Later, the Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation provided eight water bowsers to ensure a continuous supply, he added.\n\nAccording to the senior rescue official, 16 fire tenders and two snorkels were deployed to tackle the blaze. It took around 36 hours of continuous effort to bring the fire under control by Monday evening.\n\nDr Shaikh stated that a short circuit was suspected as the likely cause of the fire, although the exact reason would be determined after a thorough investigation.\n\nHe said the financial losses could not yet be estimated. Five individuals, including four firefighters, sustained minor injuries due to falling debris and burns.\n\nRescue 1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb told Dawn that three factories had been destroyed completely, while the fourth one was damaged partially in the fire that erupted in the KEPZ.\n\nHe noted that the fire occurred during the Eidul Azha holidays and the response was delayed by 45 minutes as the watchmen were asleep. Flammable materials had been stored haphazardly on every floor, contrary to standard operating procedures (SOPs), which require such substances to be stored in isolated areas.\n\nIn addition, there was no ventilation system, and thick, dense smoke posed significant challenges for the firefighters. The factory’s internal fire suppression system was also non-functional.\n\nHe confirmed that the blaze was finally extinguished after 36 hours.\n\nFire erupts in warehouses on Mauripur Road\n\nA separate blaze broke out on Monday afternoon in three warehouses located on main Mauripur Road.\n\nAccording to the Rescue 1122 spokesperson, the fire initially erupted in a warehouse storing chemicals and oil. Exploding drums sent debris flying into two adjoining warehouses, which contained LPG cylinders and perfumes.\n\nHe said SOPs were also violated here, as the combustible materials were “improperly stocked”.\n\nThe fire was brought under control after seven hours of intense efforts. Fortunately, no injuries were reported.\n\nThe spokesperson added that seven fire tenders from Rescue 1122 and two from the Pakistan Navy were used to control the blaze. Cooling efforts were still under way on Monday evening.\n\nHe said there were other warehouses where LPG cylinders were stored and if the same had caught fire, it might have triggered much destruction.\n\nThe exact cause of the fire and an assessment of the financial damage had yet to be determined, he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 10th, 2025",
