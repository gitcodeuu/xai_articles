So, think high. What you get by achieving goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals.”\n\nHabib University President Wasif Rizvi highlighted the university’s unwavering commitment to accessibility and equity in higher education, noting that 83 per cent of the Class of 2025 received financial support during their academic journey.\n\nHe expressed deep gratitude to the Mohsineen — Habib University’s donor community — whose generosity and belief in the power of education have made these transformative opportunities possible.\n\nUniversity Chancellor Rafiq M. Habib congratulated the graduates and said: “You are what makes Habib University. Your enthusiasm, curiosity, and strong bonds define the spirit of this institution. As you leave, you are equipped with the finest undergraduate education in Pakistan, ready for whatever path you choose.”\n\nIman Ashraf, Class Valedictorian from the Comparative Humanities programme, also spoke.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 10th, 2025",
