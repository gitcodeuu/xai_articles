He claimed the total economic growth during the last three years was just 1.5pc.\n\nHe said people have moved to solar energy because they cannot afford to pay electricity bills. “Inflation is still 11.5pc, but the government claims it is decreasing,” he said, questioning why the finance minister did not begin the survey presentation with inflation figures.\n\nMr Khan asserted that, by contrast, the PTI government “had brought the energy sector under control.”\n\nFocusing on agriculture, Mr Akram said the sector declined by 13pc while the government claimed livestock grew by 40pc. “How was it possible?” he asked, suggesting the decline resulted from “anti-farmer policies” as there were no major natural disasters.\n\n“Thirty-seven percent of the population was dependent on agriculture and was suffering,” Mr Akram said, adding that the government’s claim of growth in small industries was “a pack of lies.”\n\nMr Khan said the growth rate was lower than in 1992. “Growth of all crops was negative, but the donkey population has increased,” he said.\n\nThe opposition leader also said that the purchasing power of Rs50,000 in March 2022 has plummeted to just Rs20,833 today. Citing the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics, he said the price of tea has increased by 74pc.\n\nBoth leaders highlighted emigration as a major concern.\n\n“People were leaving Pakistan because of the economic issues,” Mr Akram alleged, claiming that more people will leave in the near future.\n\nMr Khan said 3.2m people have left the country in recent years, worried about inflation, purchasing power and jobs. He claimed government lawmakers “were not able to face the masses” in their constituencies.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 10th, 2025",
