The injured couple was taken to a nearby private hospital, where the husband was pronounced dead.”\n\nHe added that the wife sustained minor injuries.\n\nThe relatives told the police that they did not want any legal proceedings, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, a policeman was killed in a hit-and-run incident in Baldia, according to Saeedabad SHO Pervez Solangi.\n\n“The policeman was on his way to work when an unknown vehicle hit him, killing him on the spot. The body was taken to the Civil Hospital,” SHO Solangi said.\n\nLast month, the police said that a woman was killed and her husband injured when a water tanker hit their motorcycle and ran them over in Korangi, prompting an angry mob to set the water tanker on fire.\n\nIn April, an employee of the Pakistan Navy was killed while another was injured in Karachi’s Baldia after a 10-wheeler trailer hit them, police said.",
