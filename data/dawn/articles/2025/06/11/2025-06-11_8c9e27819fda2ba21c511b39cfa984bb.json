An Assam government spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAssam, which has a 260 km border with Bangladesh, started sending back people last month who had been declared as foreigners by its Foreigners Tribunals. Such a move is politically popular in Assam, where Bengali language speakers with possible roots in Bangladesh compete for jobs and resources with local Assamese speakers.\n\n“There is pressure from the Supreme Court to act on the expulsion of foreigners,” Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told the state assembly on Monday. “We have pushed back 303 people. These pushbacks will be intensified. We have to be more active and proactive to save the state.” He was referring to the Supreme Court asking Assam in February why it had not moved on deporting declared foreigners.\n\nBangladesh’s foreign affairs adviser, Touhid Hossain, did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment. Last week, he told reporters that people were being sent to his country from India and that the government was in touch with New Delhi over it.\n\nAman Wadud, an Assam-based lawyer who routinely fights citizenship cases and is now a member of the main opposition Congress party, said the government was “arbitrarily throwing people out of the country”. “There is a lot of panic on the ground - more than ever before,” he said.\n\nSome brought back\n\nSarma said no genuine Indian citizens will be expelled. But he added that up to four of the people deported were brought back to India because appeals challenging their non-Indian status were being heard in court.\n\nOne of them was Khairul Islam, a 51-year-old former government school teacher who was declared a foreigner by a tribunal in 2016. He spent two years in an Assam detention centre and was released on bail in August 2020.\n\nHe said police picked him up on May 23 from his home and took him to a detention centre, from where he and 31 others were rounded up by Indian border guards and loaded into a van, blindfolded and hands tied.\n\n“Then, 14 of us were put onto another truck. We were taken to a spot along the border and pushed into Bangladesh,” he said. “It was terrifying. I’ve never experienced anything like it. It was late at night. There was a straight road, and we all started walking along it.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
