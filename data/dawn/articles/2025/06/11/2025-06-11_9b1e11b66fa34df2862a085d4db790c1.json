  "content": "LONDON: Britain and four allies joined forces on Tuesday to sanction two Israeli ministers for “repeated incitements of violence” against Palestinians, upping their condemnation of Israel’s actions around the war in Gaza.\n\nFinance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir will be banned from entering the UK and will have any assets in the country frozen, Britain’s foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nThe announcement came in rare joint action alongside Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Norway and comes as the Israeli government faces growing international criticism over its conduct of the conflict with Hamas.\n\nA UK government official said that Canada and Australia had also imposed sanctions, while Norway and New Zealand had implemented travel bans only. The measures see the five countries break from Israel’s closest ally, the United States.\n\nBen Gvir and Smotrich “have incited extremist violence and serious abuses of Palestinian human rights”, the foreign ministers of the five countries said in a joint statement. “These actions are not acceptable. This is why we have taken action now — to hold those responsible to account,” they added.\n\nSmotrich and Ben Gvir are part of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fragile ruling coalition. Both have drawn criticism for their hard-line stance on the war in Gaza and comments about settlements in the occupied West Bank, the other Palestinian territory.\n\nSmotrich, who lives in a West Bank settlement, has supported the expansion of settlements and has increasingly called for the territory’s annexation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
