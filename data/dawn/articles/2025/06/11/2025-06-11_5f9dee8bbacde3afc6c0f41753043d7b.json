  "content": "KOHAT: Pakistan Peoples Party leader Amjid Afridi, the prime suspect in the high-profile murder case of former Kohat district nazim Malik Asad, was sent on judicial remand on expiry of his five-day physical custody on Tuesday.\n\nThe judicial magistrate-1 rejected the further remand plea made by the prosecutor.\n\nThe former three-time MPA and ex-provincial minister had been arrested from Islamabad last week.\n\nEarlier, his alleged accomplice, Amir, had been arrested from Islamabad airport while fleeing to Dubai. The police have placed names of eight accused nominated in the case on Exit Control List.\n\nDistrict police officer Dr Zahidullah said Amir disclosed the names of other accused, who planned the murder, and on whose information more suspects had been rounded up during raids.\n\nHe added efforts were underway by the police’s Counter-Terrorism Department and other agencies for the arrest of remaining seven accused persons, who had been declared as proclaimed offenders.\n\nHe said the seven-day police remand of the four accused would expire tomorrow (Thursday).\n\nMeanwhile, it had been erroneously mentioned in a Dawn report appeared on June 6 that efforts were underway to arrest Malik Asad’s nephew and another relative in his murder case, as in fact, the police had stated they were looking for the relatives of Amjad Afridi.\n\nThe error is, therefore, regretted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
