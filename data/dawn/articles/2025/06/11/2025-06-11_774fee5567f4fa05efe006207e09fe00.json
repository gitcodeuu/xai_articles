  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Tuesday allowed police to impartially investigate two cases registered against Grand Democratic Alliance’s leader and former federal minister Ghulam Murtaza Jatoi pertaining to his alleged involvement in a violent protest and attack on the house of Sindh Home Minister Zia Lanjar in Moro last month.\n\nHowever, a Constitutional Bench headed by Justice K. K. Agha made it clear that the cases must be investigated by an officer not below the rank of a deputy superintendent of police (DSP). It also said that the investigating officer should file reports before the magistrate concerned after completion of the probe.\n\nThe lawyers for Mr Jatoi filed an application seeking contempt proceedings against various police officials on the ground that two new cases were registered against the applicant despite an SHC order passed in November 2024 in which it had directed the Naushahro Feroze police not to lodge any FIR against him without the court permission.\n\nConstitutional Bench revives two FIRs; tells police not to harass Murtaza Jatoi or his family\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, Shaheed Benazirabad DIG Pervez Chandio informed the bench that a demonstration spiralled out of control which led to the ransacking of the home minister’s house, and two persons lost their lives. He said a private person was the complainant in the subject FIRs.\n\nHe maintained that police had suspended further investigation in respect of those cases in deference to the SHC orders and also suspended the police officers involved in lodging such FIRs.\n\nHowever, the bench noted that it did not find any contempt as the incident and subsequent FIRs did not show any deliberate intent by the alleged contemnors to disobey earlier orders as those cases were held in abeyance and action was taken against the police officers concerned.\n\nIt also observed that earlier restraining orders of the SHC did not “give a free hand for the petitioner or any other persons to go around and commit crimes”.\n\nThe bench said that those FIRs were no longer suspended and revived the same and directed police to investigate the same fairly, impartially and in accordance with law.\n\n“The IO shall not be lower than the rank of DSP and after his investigation he shall file his report before the concerned magistrate in the appropriate class. In the meantime, it is made clear that if any crime has been committed and any evidence which points to the involvement of the petitioner this may be lodged and investigated fairly. However, the police shall not cause any harassment to the petitioner or his family,” the court ruled.\n\nThe bench observed that the role of police to maintain the law and order, prevent crime and investigate FIRs in accordance with law as no individual could be allowed to take law into his own hands, especially under the garb of any court order.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
