A State Department spokesperson also declined to comment.\n\nA Harvard spokesman declined to comment to The New York Times.\n\nHarvard University did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.\n\nThe Trump administration has launched a multi-pronged attack on the nation’s oldest and wealthiest university, freezing billions of dollars in grants and other funding and proposing to end its tax-exempt status, prompting a series of legal challenges.",
