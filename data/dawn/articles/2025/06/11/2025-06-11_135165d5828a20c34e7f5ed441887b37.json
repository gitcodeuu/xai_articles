  "content": "YANGON: With every passing game, Stephen Constantine is drifting further away from his goal of steering Pakistan to the 2027 AFC Asian Cup.\n\nA 1-0 loss to Myanmar at the Thuwunna Stadium on Tuesday means Pakistan remain winless and pointless after two Group ‘L’ matches in the final round of qualifying for Asia’s elite tournament.\n\nA double-header against Afghanistan follows in October and their next opponents, who were playing Syria in the other group game later in the day, would be licking their lips at the prospect of competing against a side that gave a toothless display against Myanmar, especially in the first half.\n\n“Well, to be honest right now, I’m very disappointed, especially with the first half. I think we did not live up to the expectations, especially the defensive play that we’ve shown in the first half,” Pakistan skipper Abdullah Iqbal at the post-match presentation.\n\n“We weren’t in the shape. We didn’t dare to play really but in the second half we showed what we are capable of and that’s what we should show more because that’s what our fans deserve.\n\n“First half I’m very disappointed with. I think it’s too bad we let the whole nation down the way we played the first half. The second was much better. I want to apologise to the fans for the first half and I hope that they see some potential we showed in the second half and hopefully we give them more joy by playing that way.”\n\nAfter losing to Syria in the opening round of matches, Constantine opted for a defensive line-up but that meant frontman Fareedullah was largely isolated at the top and Myanmar found joy in the middle of the park.\n\nThe hosts dominated the ball and it paid dividends when striker Than Paing put them ahead in the 41st minute.\n\nMyanmar were awarded a free-kick from a central position, which was lifted into the box by Mg Mg Lwin and headed into the danger area before being met on the volley by Soe Moe Kya. Goalkeeper Yousuf Butt tipped that effort onto the post but the rebound fell to Paing, who was at the goalline, to steer it in.\n\nPakistan came back after half-time looking for an equaliser with Constantine reshuffling his team but against a Myanmar side, coming off a victory against Afghanistan in their opener, clear cut chances were hard to come by.\n\nThe game was initially supposed to be held in Pakistan before the Pakistan Football Federation, which was busy with organising its long-awaited elections, swapped fixtures with Myanmar. Pakistan will now play the home fixture against Myanmar in March next year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
