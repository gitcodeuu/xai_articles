  "content": "NICE: Dozens of countries at the UN oceans summit on Tuesday took a first step towards recognising an invisible but growing threat to marine life — underwater noise pollution.\n\nThe din created by shipping and other human activities is rising at an alarming rate, marine conservation groups say, a major problem for sea life reliant on sound below water to survive.\n\nWhales and dolphins use clicks and whistles to communicate with their young, navigate the oceans and warn of danger and hunt for food. “Human noise pollution is drowning out these vital sounds,” said Carlos Bravo from OceanCare, a marine conservation group.\n\nIn a step towards a quieter ocean, 37 countries led by Canada and Panama have launched a new effort to reduce harmful underwater noise pollution. At the UN Ocean Conference in Nice, France, ministers from these countries committed to advancing quieter shipping design and including noise reduction protocols in their marine protected areas.\n\n“Too often, the issue of ocean noise has been sidelined in global environmental discourse,” said Panama’s environment minister Juan Carlos Navarro. “With this coalition, we are committing to act decisively to protect marine biodiversity from this invisible yet powerful threat.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
