He warned that “dreaming of democracy and development without constitutional supremacy and rule of law is sheer fantasy”.\n\nHe said the Pashtun nation has withstood every adversity in history and found unity through traditional public councils (Jirgas).\n\n“We laid the foundation of this unity from Bannu, and the process will continue.”\n\nOn regional issues, he said the PkMAP supports the independence of Afghanistan and views China’s diplomatic efforts positively.\n\nRegarding the Baloch people, he offered solidarity on the basis of equality. “And if compelled by circumstances, we reserve the right to announce our own province,” he added.\n\nThe chairman condemned the economic policies affecting his region, calling the ban on border trade “akin to snatching food from our children’s mouths.”\n\nHe also criticised the forced deportation of Afghan refugees who have legal documents or were born in Pakistan, demanding they be granted citizenship.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
