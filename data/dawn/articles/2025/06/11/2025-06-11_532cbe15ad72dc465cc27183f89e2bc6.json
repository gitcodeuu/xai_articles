Hospitals have established heatstroke em­­ergency counters and stocked medical supplies to treat heat-related illnesses.\n\nOfficials have urged re­­sidents across the affected regions to take extreme precautions, advising them to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities, especially between 11am and 4pm\n\nThe PDMA is running an awareness campaign, appealing to residents to wear light-coloured, loose cotton clothing and stay hydrated.\n\n“This is a life-threatening situation,” said Irfan Ali Kathia, the director general of the PDMA, stressing that vulnerable groups must be protected.\n\nThe Met Department predicts no immediate relief, with the heatwave expected to continue for the next 48 to 72 hours.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 11th, 2025",
