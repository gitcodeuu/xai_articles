The people of Pakistan look up to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques [the title held by the Saudi king].”\n\nSadiq added that he expects that ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia will “further strengthen”.\n\nMeanwhile, Sindh Governor Kamran Tessori, who was also attending the luncheon, expressed his gratitude to the Saudi crown prince for the invitation to perform Haj as a royal guest.\n\n“The exemplary arrangements for the pilgrims and the services to the Muslim Ummah are commendable,” Tessori wrote on X, adding that he extended an invitation to the crown prince to visit Pakistan.\n\nPakistan and India engaged in a brief military confrontation last month, following the latter’s allegations that Islamabad orchestrated a deadly attack in occupied Kashmir’s Pahalgam; an allegation Pakistan strongly denied.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Adel Aljubeir welcomed the ceasefire between the two countries, according to a post by the Foreign Office (FO) on X.",
