The Cochin International Airport Ltd. (CIAL) said the threat was received on its official email address, Press Trust of India reported.\n\nAll passengers of the IndiGo flight had been safely disembarked, according to Nagpur Deputy Commissioner of Police Lohit Matani.\n\nWhile an investigation was underway, preliminary checks did not find anything suspicious, officials said.\n\nAfter the bomb threat was received by the CIAL airport, a Bomb Threat Assessment Committee (BTAC) was convened and the threat was declared as “specific”.\n\nAs per ANI, a similar incident happened on Monday, where a Lufthansa flight LH752 scheduled to fly from Frankfurt to India’s Hyderabad, was forced to return to Germany after a bomb threat was received through an email at Hyderabad airport at 6:01pm IST (5:31pm PKT) on June 15.\n\nA committee was formed to assess the threat as per the standard operating procedure.\n\nOn June 13, an Air India flight AI 379 flying from Phuket to New Delhi with 156 passengers on board also received a bomb threat and was forced to land back in the southern Thai island after making a wide loop around the Andaman Sea.\n\nThe incident followed the crash on an Air India flight in Ahmedabad on June 12, shortly after takeoff, killing at least 271 people, including nearly 30 people on the ground.\n\nSeparately, a plane carrying hundreds of Haj pilgrims back from Saudi Arabia was diverted in Indonesia today after an email bomb threat was sent to authorities, Indonesia’s aviation body said.\n\nThe Directorate General of Civil Aviation said it received a report from Indonesia’s airport operator “regarding a bomb threat sent by an unidentified person via electronic mail”.\n\nThe email at 7:30am (5:30am PKT) contained a threat to “blow up” Saudia Airlines flight SV 5276, which was flying from Jeddah to the Indonesian capital Jakarta, it said in a statement.\n\nAfter 10am (8am PKT) the pilot diverted the plane from its destination of Jakarta’s Soekarno-Hatta International Airport to Kualanamu International Airport in Medan, a city on Sumatra island in western Indonesia.\n\nThe flight was carrying 442 Haj pilgrims, including 207 men and 235 women, it added.\n\n“Upon identifying security and safety threats, the pilot decided to divert the landing to the nearest airport,” said InJourney Airports, Indonesia’s airport operator.\n\nA transport ministry official told AFP the plane was still in Medan, and Flightradar24 showed the plane there.\n\nThe airport evacuated the pilgrims, and a bomb disposal unit swept the plane for explosive devices, the aviation body said in its statement.",
