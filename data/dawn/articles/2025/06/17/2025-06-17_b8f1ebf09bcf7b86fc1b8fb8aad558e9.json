  "content": "KARACHI: Five more tremors hit parts of the city on Monday, raising the tally of low-intensity earthquakes to 45 since June 1.\n\nAccording to the data available with the seismic centre of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the first two tremors of 2.5 and 2.6 magnitudes were reported at 2:12pm and 2:31pm.\n\nThe epicentres of both the quakes were located 15 kilometres away from DHA City and their depths were recorded at 10km and 27km.\n\nThe last three tremors were recorded at 6:02pm, 6:23pm and 7:22pm. Their magnitudes were 2,5, 1.5 and 1.9, with their epicentres located 1.5km north of, 7km northwest of and 4km southeast of Malir, at a depth of 10km.\n\nSince June 1, the PMD has recorded 45 tremors, most of them in areas near Malir. The other areas include parts of Quaidabad, Gadap, DHA City, DHA and Korangi. Their intensity so far has ranged from 1.8 magnitude to 3.6 magnitude on the Richter scale.\n\nAccording to experts, the fault lines passing along the areas of Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir have become active after several decades and releasing accumulated energy in the form of low intensity earthquakes in areas close to them.\n\nThe experts said that minor seismic activities “pre-empt high-intensity earthquakes” by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates and that the seismic activity will gradually settle down.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 17th, 2025",
