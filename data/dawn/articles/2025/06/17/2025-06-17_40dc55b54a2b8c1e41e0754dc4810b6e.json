  "content": "The United States on Saturday launched air strikes targeting Iran’s main nuclear sites, as Washington joined Israel’s war with Tehran in a flashpoint moment for the Middle East.\n\nAccording to US President Donald Trump, the strikes “totally obliterated” Iran’s Fordow, Isfahan and Natanz nuclear sites. In response, Iran warned of “everlasting consequences”, saying that the US “betrayed diplomacy.”\n\nOn Sunday, Iran’s parliament voted to close the Strait of Hormuz, through which around 20 per cent of the world’s oil and gas flows, Reuters reported, citing Iran’s Press TV.\n\nOn June 13, Israel launched strikes against Iran on saying it targeted nuclear facilities, ballistic missile factories and military commanders during the start of a prolonged operation to prevent Tehran from building an atomic weapon.\n\nIran, which has denied such intentions, had in the past threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz for traffic in retaliation for Western pressure. Experts have said that any closure of the strait could restrict trade and impact global oil prices.\n\nBelow are details about the strait: The strait lies between Oman and Iran and links the Gulf north of it with the Gulf of Oman to the south and the Arabian Sea beyond. It is 21 miles (33 km) wide at its narrowest point, with the shipping lane just 2 miles (3 km) wide in either direction.\n\nAbout a fifth of the world’s total oil consumption passes through the strait. Between the start of 2022 and last month, roughly 17.8 million to 20.8m barrels of crude, condensate and fuels flowed through the strait daily, according to data from Vortexa.\n\nThe Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members Saudi Arabia, Iran, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Iraq export most of their crude via the strait, mainly to Asia. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have sought to find other routes to bypass the strait.\n\nAround 2.6m bpd of unused capacity from existing UAE and Saudi pipelines could be available to bypass Hormuz, the US Energy Information Administration said in June last year.\n\nQatar, among the world’s biggest liquefied natural gas exporters, sends almost all of its LNG through the strait.\n\nIran has threatened over the years to block the strait but has never followed through.\n\nThe US Fifth Fleet, based in Bahrain, is tasked with protecting commercial shipping in the area.\n\nIn 1973, Arab producers led by Saudi Arabia slapped an oil embargo on Western supporters of Israel in its war with Egypt.\n\nWhile Western countries were the main buyers of crude produced by the Arab countries at the time, nowadays Asia is the main buyer of OPEC’s crude.\n\nThe United States more than doubled its oil liquids production in the last two decades and has turned from the world’s biggest oil importer into one of the top exporters. During the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq War, the two sides sought to disrupt each other’s exports in what was called the Tanker War.\n\nIn July 1988, a US warship shot down an Iranian airliner, killing all 290 aboard, in what Washington said was an accident and Tehran said was a deliberate attack.\n\nIn January 2012, Iran threatened to block the strait in retaliation for US and European sanctions. In May 2019, four vessels — including two Saudi oil tankers — were attacked off the UAE coast, outside the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nIn July 2021, an Israeli-managed oil tanker was attacked off Oman’s coast, killing two crew members, with Israel blaming Iran for the incident, which Iran denied.\n\nThree vessels, two in 2023 and one in 2024, were seized by Iran near or in the Strait of Hormuz.\n\nOn June 17, 2025, two oil tankers collided and caught fire, near the Strait of Hormuz, where electronic interference has surged during the conflict between Iran and Israel, but there were no injuries to crew or spillage reported.",
