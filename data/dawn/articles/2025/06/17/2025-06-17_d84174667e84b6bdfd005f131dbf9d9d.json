  "content": "PAKISTAN is on the front lines of the global climate crisis, yet continues to approach the challenge with a troubling mix of policy confusion, underfunding, and institutional weakness.\n\nThe country remains among the most climate-vulnerable in the world, without contributing even 1pc to GHG emissions. From the devastating floods of 2022 that affected over 33m people, to the recurring heatwaves, droughts and water shortages, the evidence is everywhere.\n\nWhat remains missing is a credible, well-resourced plan to take these challenges head-on — a plan rooted in data, foresight and political commitment.\n\nThe recently unveiled federal budget once again reveals the contradictions that have long plagued our climate policy. While the government claims to prioritise climate resilience, its actual allocations tell a different story.\n\nOnly Rs85bn has been allocated to adaptation — the category that includes essential interventions such as disaster preparedness, food and water security, early warning systems, and climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nA staggering Rs603bn, on the other hand, has gone to mitigation, largely centred around energy sector subsidies and rebranded hydropower projects.\n\nThis imbalance is difficult to justify. The finance minister himself has acknowledged that adaptation is our foremost climate challenge. Yet, year after year, budgets continue to reflect a lopsided focus on mitigation — a domain where Pakistan’s global emissions profile gives it limited room to make meaningful impact.\n\nIt is the country’s exposure to floods, heat, glacial melt and food insecurity that requires urgent and sustained investment, particularly in vulnerable regions such as Sindh, Balochistan and south Punjab.\n\nCompounding the problem are self-defeating fiscal decisions. While a carbon levy has been introduced to curb fossil fuel consumption — a step in the right direction — the government has increased taxes on solar panel imports and hybrid vehicles.\n\nIncentives for EVs have also been rolled back. These contradictory signals only undermine public confidence in the government’s commitment to a green transition and discourage much-needed private sector participation.\n\nInstitutional capacity is another concern. The Ministry of Climate Change has seen its funding slashed from Rs3.5bn to Rs2.7bn. This not only weakens its ability to conduct research and develop evidence-based policies, but also limits its role in coordinating and implementing climate finance from international donors.\n\nMeanwhile, the provinces lack the resources and expertise to implement adaptation measures effectively. We cannot afford to continue down this path. The costs of inaction are already evident — in economic losses, in displaced communities and in rising climate-related deaths.\n\nIf the country is to weather the storms ahead, it must align its words with actions, prioritise adaptation, eliminate policy contradictions, and empower its institutions to lead from the front. The climate clock is ticking — and Pakistan is running out of time.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 17th, 2025",
