They also come with immense risks of escalation and catastrophic miscalculation — particularly when disinformation is rife — and may end up making a country’s population less safe, not more.”\n\nIndia-Pakistan tensions\n\nThe yearbook notes that tensions between India and Pakistan briefly spilled over into armed conflict in early 2025. Both nations continued to develop new types of nuclear delivery systems in 2024.\n\nIndia is believed to have slightly expanded its arsenal, increasing its stored warheads from 172 in 2024 to 180 in 2025.\n\nPakistan’s stockpile of 170 stored warheads remained unchanged, but the report notes its continued development of new delivery systems and accumulation of fissile material suggest its arsenal might expand over the coming decade.\n\nIndia has been developing new “canisterised” missiles, which allow warheads to be transported while mated to the missile. This, along with sea-based patrols, suggests a strategic shift toward keeping some nuclear weapons deployed with their launchers during peacetime.\n\n“These weapons are assigned to a maturing nuclear triad of aircraft, land-based missiles and nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines”, the report said.\n\nBoth India and Pakistan are pursuing the capability to deploy multiple warheads on ballistic missiles.\n\nWhile Pakistan remains the focus of India’s nuclear deterrent, the report states that India appears to be placing growing emphasis on longer-range weapons capable of reaching targets throughout China.\n\nBig powers\n\nOf the total global inventory of about 12,241 warheads in January 2025, about 9,614 were in military stockpiles for potential use.\n\nAn estimated 3,912 of those were deployed with missiles and aircraft, with around 2,100 kept in a state of high operational alert on ballistic missiles, all but a few belonging to Russia or the U.S.\n\nAccording to the report, China’s nuclear arsenal has grown faster than that of any other country, reaching an estimated 600 warheads by early 2025.\n\nBeijing has advanced work on about 350 new missile silos, and the report suggests China could have as many intercontinental ballistic missiles as either Russia or the US by the turn of the decade.\n\nRussia and the US, together, still possess around 90 per cent of all nuclear weapons in the world. While their military stockpiles remained stable in 2024, both are implementing extensive modernisation programs.\n\nThe report warns of a likely increase in the number of warheads deployed on strategic missiles after the bilateral New START treaty expires in February 2026, unless a new agreement is reached.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 17th, 2025",
