  "content": "PESHAWAR: Fata Steel Mills Owners’ Association has rejected the 10 per cent tax on manufacturing units in the region, saying the decision would lay a very negative impact on business activities in the tribal districts.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference at the Peshawar Press Club on Monday, the association’s leaders led by Wajid Afridi expressed their disappointment over the decision in the federal budget.\n\nThey claimed that the government had promised not to impose taxes in tribal districts until 2028, which was confirmed by the National Assembly when the merger took place.\n\nHowever, they regretted that the government had gone back on its promise and imposed a 10pc tax on steel mills and other industries in the region.\n\nThe association’s leaders argued that the tax would further exacerbate the already dire situation in merged areas, where industries are struggling to survive.\n\nThey demanded that the government withdraw the tax and provide relief to the industries instead.\n\nThe leaders also criticised the government for not fulfilling its promises made during the merger, including providing infrastructure and industrial zones in the region.\n\nThey warned that if the tax was not withdrawn, they would launch a protest movement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 17th, 2025",
