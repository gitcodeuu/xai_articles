  "content": "Nine of the world’s top-10 men and nine of the top-10 women have officially entered into the US Open’s revamped mixed doubles event, tournament organisers said on Tuesday, with former singles champions Carlos Alcaraz and Emma Raducanu teaming up.\n\nThe competition, which will take place a week before the singles main draw during its “Fan Week”, will award $1 million in prize money to the winning team.\n\nSixteen teams have entered and the entry window closes on July 28, after which the top eight teams with the best combined singles ranking will be in the draw via direct acceptance, with eight more wildcard entries.\n\n“In our initial discussions about reimagining and elevating the US Open mixed doubles championship, we wanted to find a way to showcase the world’s best men and women competing with and against one another,” USTA CEO Lew Sherr said.\n\n“We were confident that we would be able to get the top players in the game excited about this unique opportunity. Seeing the teams that have already put their names on the entry list makes us all incredibly excited.\n\n“It shows that the players are behind what we are trying to do, and we know that the fans will love it.”\n\nOther pairs include twice US Open champion Naomi Osaka teaming up with Nick Kyrgios, as well as Paula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas.\n\nThe matches will be best of three sets, with short sets to four games, no-ad scoring, tiebreakers at four-all and a 10-point tiebreak in lieu of a third set.\n\nThe final will be a best-of-three set match to six games.\n\nAlthough a number of big names such as Jannik Sinner, Novak Djokovic, Aryna Sabalenka, Iga Swiatek and Naomi Osaka have entered, the format came in for criticism from renowned doubles players.\n\nReigning champions Sara Errani and Andrea Vavassori said the new format was a “profound injustice” that disrespects doubles players, describing the new event as a “pseudo-exhibition focused only on entertainment and show”.\n\nThe US Open had said the changes were made following the success of the “Mixed Madness” exhibition event held ahead of last year’s tournament, which paired up a number of high-profile singles players into teams.\n\n“Making decisions just following the logic of profit is profoundly wrong in some situations,” Italians Errani and Vavassori had said.\n\nThe pair have entered the competition this year.\n\nEmma Raducanu and Carlos Alcaraz\n\nIga Swiatek and Casper Ruud\n\nEmma Navarro and Jannik Sinner\n\nAryna Sabalenka and Grigor Dimitrov\n\nOlga Danilovic and Novak Djokovic\n\nNaomi Osaka and Nick Kyrgios\n\nQinwen Zheng and Jack Draper\n\nJessica Pegula and Tommy Paul\n\nJasmine Paolini and Lorenzo Musetti\n\nElena Rybakina and Taylor Fritz\n\nMirra Andreeva and Daniil Medvedev\n\nMadison Keys and Frances Tiafoe\n\nPaula Badosa and Stefanos Tsitsipas\n\nBelinda Bencic and Alexander Zverev\n\nTaylor Townsend and Ben Shelton\n\nSara Errani and Andrea Vavassori\n\nWorld number one Aryna Sabalenka said she has apologised to Coco Gauff after dismissing the American’s maiden French Open triumph, adding that she regrets the comments she made about the 21-year-old after the final.\n\nSabalenka had been poised for victory after claiming the opening set in a tiebreak, only to watch Gauff orchestrate a stunning 6-7(5) 6-2 6-4 comeback to claim her second Grand Slam title.\n\nSabalenka made 70 unforced errors in the final and later said at a press conference that Gauff won “not because she played incredible, (but) because I made all of those mistakes” — comments she has since regretted making.\n\n“It was just totally unprofessional of me, I let my emotions get the better of me. I absolutely regret what I said back then,” Sabalenka told Eurosport. “We all make mistakes. I’m only human and I’m still learning in life. We all have those days when we lose control.\n\n“The difference with me is that the world watches me do it, I get a lot more hate afterwards for what I did than other people.”\n\nSabalenka said she had reached out to Gauff personally afterwards to apologise.\n\n“I wanted to apologise and make sure that she knows that she absolutely deserved to win the tournament and that I respect her. I never intended to attack her,” Sabalenka added.\n\n“I was super emotional and not very smart at that press conference. I’m not necessarily grateful for what I did.\n\n“It took me a while to look at it again, to go into it with my eyes open and to understand. I realised a lot about myself.”\n\nHaving lost two Grand Slam finals this year, Sabalenka will now turn her attention to the grasscourt swing, warming up for Wimbledon by playing at the Berlin Open this week.",
