I was scared. I stood up and ran. There were pieces of the plane all around me,” he said. “Someone grabbed hold of me and put me in an ambulance and brought me to the hospital.”\n\nHe said that his brother Ajay was seated in a different row on the plane. “He was travelling with me and I can’t find him anymore. Please help me find him,” he said.\n\nA video shared by Indian news outlet India Today showed an injured Viswashkumar limping towards an ambulance, surrounded by onlookers.\n\nThe plane came down in a residential area, crashing into a medical college hostel outside the airport during lunch hour. It was headed for Gatwick Airport, south of the British capital.\n\nAhmedabad police chief GS Malik told Reuters that 204 bodies had been recovered from the crash site. Though he initially reported that there were no survivors, he later told the Indian news agency ANI that there was one survivor who was under treatment.",
