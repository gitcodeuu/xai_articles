  "content": "LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Wednesday rejected a prosecution request seeking additional time to conduct polygraph (lie detection) and photogrammetric (facial and voice analysis) tests of incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan in 12 cases pertaining to May 9 riots registered against him.\n\nAnnouncing a reserved verdict, ATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill observed that granting a third opportunity to the accused after his two refusals would merely be a waste of time.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge noted that the police were already granted two chances to conduct the tests of the accused, but they failed to do so.\n\nThe judge further observed that the accused was given two opportunities to prove his innocence, but due to his persistent refusal, those chances were wasted.\n\nJudge Gill stated that there was no need for another opportunity.\n\nAddressing the point how the investigation would proceed without the tests, the judge said it was the investigating officer’s responsibility to complete the investigation using all available legal means.\n\nThe judge remarked that the case in hand was unprecedented in Pakistan’s legal history, as the accused was refusing to prove his innocence.\n\nThe other day, DSP Legal Javed Asif had submitted a report before the court, saying the accused (Imran Khan) refused for the third time to undergo the tests. He claimed that these tests were necessary to complete the investigation into the May 9 incidents, but the accused was not cooperating with the police.\n\nHe asked the court to grant another opportunity to conduct these tests.\n\nThe police sought permission to conduct the tests inside Adiala Jail, Rawalpindi, where Imran Khan is currently imprisoned.\n\nThe tests were to be carried out in 12 cases, including those pertaining to Jinnah House and Askari Tower attacks. Other cases include attacks on Shadman police station and party offices of the PML-N.\n\nAs many as 12 FIRs had been registered at different police stations of Lahore against the PTI leaders and workers on charges of attacking and vandalising public and private property, besides army facilities, including the residence of the corps commander, during the May 9 protests.\n\nThe widespread attacks erupted after the arrest of former prime minister Imran Khan in a graft case by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) from the Islamabad High Court premises.\n\nBesides terrorism charge under section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997, various other offences, including waging or attempting to wage a war, or abetting waging of war against Pakistan, abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier from his duty and rioting were added to the FIRs.\n\nRelief: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday ordered removal of a May 9 case suspect from the Passport Control List (PCL) in light of the police investigation report.\n\nJustice Shams Mehmood Mirza passed the order hearing a petition filed by Raja Shahzad, who challenged the inclusion of his name in the PCL.\n\nDuring the hearing, a law officer submitted reports on behalf of the police and other concerned agencies. He said although the petitioner’s mobile phone location appeared in the geofencing data on May 10, 2023, the investigation did not find any evidence of his involvement in the incident.\n\nHe said the authorities confirmed that the petitioner’s arrest was not required and they had no objection to the removal of his name from the PCL.\n\nThe petitioner had requested the court to remove his name from the PCL, pleading that he had no role in the May 9 incidents.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 12th, 2025",
