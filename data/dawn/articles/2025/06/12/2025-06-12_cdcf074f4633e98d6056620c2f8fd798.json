Do not force KP residents to agitate for their rights,” he warned.\n\nThe minister insisted that the federal government refused to allocate funds for KP just because its residents voted for Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf founder Imran Khan.\n\nHe said the outlay of the next federal budget totaled Rs17.5 trillion, with major chunk to be used to pay off debts.\n\nMr Shah said a budget could be called people-friendly only if led the country to prosperity.\n\nHe complained that the country’s annual exports had decreased, while the revenues, too, were on the decline.\n\nThe minister said that KP generated over 6,000 megawatts of electricity but consumed only 4,000 watts.\n\nHe said excessive power cuts had forced residents into installing solar panels but they, too, were taxed.\n\nMr Shah said Rs9 trillion was to be paid as interest on loans, while the annual development budget’s amount had been reduced from Rs1.5 trillion for 2024-25 to Rs1 trillion for 2025-26.\n\n“This budget is for the elite and not for the poor,” he said.\n\nThe minister said that traders paid Rs65 billion taxes annually but those payments by salaried class totaled Rs400 billion.\n\nHe said that only the poor people were taxed.\n\nMr Shah said that economic stability wasn’t possible without political stability in the country.\n\n“We [PTI] reject this budget. The opposition benches should join hands with us to raise voice for the province’s interests,” he said.\n\nOn the occasion, MPA Shafiullah Jan claimed that several attempts were made by powers-that-be to strike a deal with detained PTI founder Imran Khan but such bids didn’t succeed.\n\nHe said Imran Khan only demanded a judicial commission to look into the May 9 riots and Nov 26 deaths of PTI workers in Islamabad.\n\nMr Jan claimed that former prime minister and PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif’s exit from the country was facilitated through a deal with the establishment, but decisions on the cases against detained PTI founder Imran Khan were being delayed.\n\nPML-N member Shah Jahan Yousaf spoke about the law and order situation and said that the government should check crimes committed by illegal immigrants.\n\nHe claimed that a group of Afghan nationals kidnapped a three-year-old child before contacting his parents to demand ransom.\n\nMr Yousaf said that the police recovered the child during an operation.\n\nHe raised concern about the growing incidents of robbery and said more and more such cases were reported in Hazara Division, especially after the federal government announced a crackdown on illegal immigrants.\n\nThe lawmaker said the government should strengthen law-enforcement agencies to prevent such cases.\n\nDuring the sitting, law minister Aftab Alam Afridi tabled the KP Prosecution Services Constitution, Function and Powers Amendment Bill, 2025, KP Charities Amendment Bill, 2025, KP Legal Aid Amendment Bill, 2025, KP Government Servants Housing Foundation Bill, 2025, KP Asaan Karobar Bill, 2025, and KP Climate Action Board Bill, 2025.\n\nThe house passed the KP Sentencing Amendment Bill, 2025, which was tabled by Mr Afridi. It also approved the KP Commission on the Status of Women Amendment Bill, 2025, after minister for social welfare Qasim Ali Shah laid it.\n\nThe members passed a resolution demanding the easing of medical tests for overseas Pakistanis.\n\nThe resolution, moved by MPA Obaidullah, read that some private medical centres deliberately pointed out issues in medical tests of overseas Pakistanis and charged heavy amounts.\n\nIt added that the house demanded of the federal government to introduce an monitoring policy for private medical centres, form an autonomous body, and establish centres for providing low-cost medical tests.\n\nPML-N member Sobia Shahid pointed out a lack of quorum for the third time in the first 30 minutes of the session.\n\nOfficials of the assembly secretariat went for the headcount and found the required number of members present in the house.\n\n“The question of quorum is ruled out,” the chair announced when the PML-N lawmaker pointed out a lack of quorum for the fourth time.\n\nHe later prorogued the sitting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 12th, 2025",
