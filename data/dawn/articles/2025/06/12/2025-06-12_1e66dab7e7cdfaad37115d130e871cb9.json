  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Super League (PSL) next year is set to clash with the high-profile Indian Premier League (IPL) as the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is mulling to hold the event in the same window as the IPL, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe reason being given is that with the T20 World Cup scheduled in February-March next year and some Future Tours Programme commitments, it might not be possible again to hold the PSL in its normal window of February-March.\n\n“There is a window available to the Pakistan board in December and first half of January but it has already given NOCs to Pakistani players to play in the Big Bash in Australia in this period and has also planned some domestic activities,” PTI quoted a source as saying.\n\n“So the discussion now with the franchise owners is to prepare for the PSL to be held in April-May just like this year.”\n\nAn official in the PSL secretariat said that when the PSL was held this year and overlapped with the IPL due to the Champions Trophy in Pakistan in February-March, there was no effect on the viewership or interest which the PSL normally gets every year.\n\n“Initially there was some concern that having the PSL in the same window as the IPL might hit our league, but surprisingly viewership figures on TV and other media improved and the franchise owners got a chance to sign on some notable overseas players who were not picked in the IPL auction,” he added.\n\nWith 10 editions now completed, the valuation of the existing six franchise teams will also be carried out before the next PSL and the PCB is thinking about a 25 per cent increase in franchise fees.\n\nAll the franchise owners except Multan Sultans’ owner Ali Tareen, teams have confirmed in writing their intent to retain ownership for the next 10-years but Ali who pays the highest franchise fee wants a review of all franchise fees as he has concerns over financial losses.\n\nThe next edition of the event is also significant since the PSL secretariat is also set to invite bids for two more new teams, the work for which has already started.\n\nApparently the PCB also wants the 10-year title sponsorship agreement to be be reviewed and renewed and a new deal for live streaming will also be required.\n\nCurrently, PCB earns about Rs900 million annually from the title sponsorship. Last year, live streaming rights for Pakistan were sold for approximately Rs1.8 billion.\n\nLocal broadcast rights generated around Rs6.3 billion, while international rights brought in $4.6 million. Ground rights were sold for around Rs2 billion for two years.\n\nFor TV production, PCB signed a two-year deal worth $2.25 million annually. Tenders will be issued for all these agreements, followed by lengthy processes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 12th, 2025",
