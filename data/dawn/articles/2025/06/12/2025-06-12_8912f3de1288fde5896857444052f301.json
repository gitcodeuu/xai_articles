  "content": "BEIRUT: Peace between Syria and Israel is “very possible”, a Trump-linked evangelical Christian pastor said after he and a pro-Israel American rabbi held talks this week with Syria’s leader Ahmed al-Sharaa at the presidential palace in Damascus.\n\nRev. Johnnie Moore, a White House adviser during President Donald Trump’s first term, and Rabbi Abraham Cooper, from the Jewish human rights organisation Simon Wiesenthal Center, have promoted interfaith dialogue in Arab states for years.\n\nThe two men met Sharaa on Monday during a visit to Syria that they said was not aimed at discussing potential ties with Israel, though the topic came up. “I think peace is very possible, if not probable, but the first priority has to be Syria focusing on Syria,” Moore said in a phone interview late on Tuesday, after they had concluded their trip.\n\nSharaa “articulated issues of concern he has, but also the potential for a very positive future”, Moore added. Since ousting former strongman Bashar al-Assad last year, Syria’s rulers, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have rapidly built international ties. But tensions persist with religious minority groups inside Syria, such as Druze and Alawis, as well as with neighbouring Israel.\n\nCooper’s visits to nations such as Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, which had no ties with Israel at the time, are credited by some observers with indirectly paving the way for landmark 2020 deals normalising relations.\n\nEfforts by the US to bring more Arab states, chiefly Saudi Arabia, into the deals known as the Abraham Accords have faltered amid regional outrage over the deaths of more than 50,000 Palestinians as a result of Israel’s war in Gaza following Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack on Israel.\n\nPeace-making agenda\n\nStill, Syria’s new rulers have from the outset indicated that they seek calm and even eventual peace with Israel. Moore and Cooper said they believed Sharaa was uniquely able to deliver on a peace-making agenda.\n\n“The Syrian president is what in Silicon Valley is called a unicorn; he’s one of a kind,” Moore said. Cooper added: “What’s clear is there is now a window of opportunity to bring about a more positive state of affairs… that doesn’t minimise the scale of the task ahead.” Last week, Moore was named as the new executive chairman of the US-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), which has begun distributing aid to the Palestinian territory in an operation that uses private US security and logistics companies and has been criticised by the United Nations.\n\nMoore, who has publicly backed Trump’s proposal for the United States to take over Gaza, said he did not discuss the GHF and its work with Sharaa during their meeting.\n\nMoore and Cooper proposed to Sharaa joint humanitarian projects “to tear down stereotypes and create an unofficial army of goodwill ambassadors”.\n\nThe two men also met with Syrian Christian leaders and walked freely around Damascus, Cooper wearing his yarmulke without issue, he said. This contrasted with a 2024 visit to Saudi Arabia, where Cooper was asked by a Saudi official to remove his prayer cap, a request he refused, after which the US-Congress mandated delegation he was heading cut short their trip.\n\nIsraeli officials initially branded Syria’s new rulers as “terrorists” due to their Al Qaeda past and the Israeli airforce waged a fierce campaign of aerial bombardment that has subsided since mid-May, when Trump turned decades of US policy on its head by lifting sanctions on Syria and meeting Sharaa in Riyadh.\n\nAfter meeting Sharaa, Trump said the Syrian leader had agreed to a request to normalise ties with Israel, though it would take time.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 12th, 2025",
