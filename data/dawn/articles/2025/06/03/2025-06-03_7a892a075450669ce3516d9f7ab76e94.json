  "content": "KARACHI: A sessions court granted post-arrest bail to Kamran Asghar Qureshi, father of prime suspect Armaghan in the Mustafa Amir murder case, in a case pertaining to the alleged recovery of an unlicensed pistol from his possession.\n\nThe suspect had filed an application through his counsel Khurram Abbas before Additional District and Sessions Judge (South) Muhammad Sulleman Buriro, seeking post-arrest bail in the illicit arms case.\n\nAfter hearing the defence and prosecution sides, the court granted the post-arrest bail to Kamran against a surety bond of Rs100,000 along with a personnel bond.\n\nBut the suspect will remain behind bars as his counsel told Dawn that he is already in jail custody in two other cases, including those of recovery of drugs and weapons from the Armaghan’s house in DHA.\n\nIn its order, the court noted that the suspect was apprehended on Mar 20, in a case pertaining to the alleged recovery of drugs and an unlicensed pistol from his possession.\n\n“The offence of recovery of unlicensed weapon is punishable up to 14 years attracted with a prohibitory clause of Section 497 [of the] CrPC, but in the instant case, all the witnesses are police officials. There is no chance of tampering of prosecution case evidence,” it further said.\n\nThe court observed that the suspect had been in judicial custody since the date of the arrest and was no longer required for further investigation, adding that the trial had yet to begin and the prosecution still had to prove the offence against the suspect, which would take time to complete.\n\nDuring the hearing, counsel Abbas contended that the suspect was falsely implicated in that case. He also submitted that nothing had been recovered from the possession of the suspect and claimed that the alleged recovery had been foisted upon him.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2025",
