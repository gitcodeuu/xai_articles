  "content": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: A 13-year-old girl was killed in a landmine explosion in Razin village of Upper South Waziristan’s Shawal tehsil on Sunday evening.\n\nResidents said the young girl from the Mehsud Jalalkhel tribe, was playing near a hillside close to her home when she accidentally stepped on a landmine.\n\nThe incident was confirmed by additional deputy commissioner Fazal Wadood, who assured all possible support to the bereaved family.\n\nGul Badin Mehsud, a local leader of National Democratic Movement from Shawal, condemned the incident, calling such explosions a crime against humanity. He said landmines had not only claimed precious lives but had also left dozens of children and innocent civilians permanently disabled.\n\nIt merits a mention here that numerous explosions have occurred over the past several years, resulting in hundreds of deaths and injuries – mostly to children. A similar incident took place earlier this year, on March 25, when a 10-year-old boy was killed by a landmine in the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2025",
