The third child is stated to be in critical condition.\n\nAbdur Rehman (32), a resident of Basti Pir Bakhsh of the Sardargarh area, was a tractor-trolley driver and was out of work.\n\nOn Sunday, his two sons, Umar (9) and Sufyan (11), and daughter, Asifa (8), demanded new clothes from him for Eidul Azha. As Rehman had no money for new clothes, he consumed pills used to preserve wheat and administered the same to his children in a suicide attempt.\n\nAll four members of the family were shifted to the Shaikh Zayed Medical College and Hospital where Rehman, Umar and Sufyan died while Asifa was in a critical condition when this report was filed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2025",
