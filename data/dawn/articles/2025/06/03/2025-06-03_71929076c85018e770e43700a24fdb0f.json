The same day, another policeman was martyred in an exchange of fire after attackers threw a hand grenade near a mosque in Gwadar.\n\nOn May 21, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu. “Terrorists launched the attack using hand grenades late at night, causing some damage to the checkpost,” according to the police.",
