  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan Twenty20 International captain Salman Ali Agha has vowed that the side will continue to “entertain” the fans after registering a 3-0 series triumph over Bangladesh.\n\nAlthough it came against a non-elite opponent, the success was special for Pakistan, who announced their transition into a modern-day white-ball side, displaying a high-risk approach that paid dividends across the series.\n\nThey won the first two matches by 37 and 57 runs respectively, defending with ease scores of 201 in each before chasing down 197 with 16 balls to spare in the final game.\n\nIn Pakistan’s first T20I series victory on home soil since December 2021, they scored 200-plus runs on the trot after two years. While Mohammad Haris’ century in the third game was the first time a non-opener scored a ton for the side in the format.\n\n“The way we’ve played in these three matches is the kind of cricket we want to continue playing moving forward,” Salman told reporters after the third T20I here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Sunday night. “Our aim is to entertain the fans, and if we keep putting pressure on the opposition, we’ll win most matches.\n\nIt was the batting approach taken by the hosts that stood out, especially with younger players taking the game on and making the impact. Hasan Nawaz’s 22-ball 44 was the highlight of the first match, with the 22-year-old smashing 56 off 26 in the second, which also saw opener Sahibzada Farhan hit 74 off 41.\n\nHasan, having established himself as a middle-order batter after starting his career as an opener in New Zealand earlier this year, made impact with a 13-ball 26 in the third match.\n\nBut it was wicket-keeper/batter Haris, who took the man-of-the-series award, registering scores of 31 off 18 and 41 off 25 before smashing a 46-ball 107 to cement his spot as Pakistan’s new number-three.\n\n“People said he doesn’t use his brain, but in the first match, when we were 5-2, he took calculated risks and batted smartly,” Salman said of the right-hander “He did the same today.\n\n“For me, Haris, Saim (Ayub), and Hasan are three players I want to turn into match-winners for Pakistan under my captaincy. I believe they can do wonders for the team.”\n\nThe series was Mike Hesson’s first assignment as Pakistan’s new white-ball head coach and Salman’s second as captain. It was a continuation to Pakistan’s preparations for next year’s T20 World Cup in Sri Lanka.\n\nThe duo will lead the side into upcoming series against the West Indies and Bangladesh away from home and also in the Asia Cup, scheduled to be held later this year.\n\nThere remains a concern whether Pakistan would be able to produce similar performances in different conditions, but Salman’s vision is clear.\n\n“Modern cricket isn’t about ignoring conditions — you have to adapt,” he said. “Our approach is to score 10–15 runs above the par score for the ground to give our bowlers an advantage.\n\n“When bowling, we aim to restrict the opposition to 10–15 runs below par to make it easier for our batsmen. Whatever the conditions, we’ll follow the par score strategy.”\n\nSalman, speaking with precision and confidence during the press conference, reiterated that he wanted to make a long-lasting difference through his leadership.\n\n“One thing is certain: as long as I’m captain, we’ll play this way,” he said. “I believe this is the way forward for cricket because that’s how the world is playing.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2025",
