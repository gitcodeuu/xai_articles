  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has made it mandatory for all international players to participate in at least one domestic tournament each season, in a bid to strengthen the local cricketing structure and groom emerging talent.\n\nThe decision was taken during a high-level meeting chaired by PCB chief Mohsin Naqvi at the Gaddafi Stadium on Monday. Emphasising the importance of a robust domestic system, Mohsin said that the involvement of international cricketers in domestic competitions would not only raise the standard of the game at grassroots level but also help in preparing quality backups for the national side.\n\nThe meeting also reviewed preparations for the upcoming home series against South Africa and Sri Lanka, as well as away tours to the West Indies and Bangladesh. A detailed briefing in this regard was given by director international cricket Usman Wahla.\n\nPreparations for the Pakistan Shaheens team and matters related to new central contracts were also discussed, with the chairman directing concerned departments to initiate the necessary processes.\n\nThose present at the meeting included white-ball head coach Mike Hesson, chief operating officer Sumair Ahmed syed, team manager Naveed Akram Cheema, Director High-Performance Aqib Javed, and national team captain Salman Ali Agha.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2025",
