Likewise, no new projects have been allocated to the provinces,” he said.\n\nThe adviser to the chief minister said of the Rs1 trillion development budget, Rs120 billion was from savings that were not provided as fuel subsidies, which were being used to build roads in Balochistan.\n\nThis means that the actual Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) is Rs880 billion only, according to him.\n\nMr Aslam said under the “Uraan Pakistan” programme, discussions were held on sports, water, and the environment, and Rs65 billion was initially allocated to higher education. “This has now been slashed to Rs45 billion—without any consultation with the provinces,” he said.\n\nHe pointed out that the government had earlier said that projects which are more than 75 per cent complete would be prioritised, yet two road projects in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa that were over 90 per cent complete have been deleted, which he called a clear injustice and raised during today’s meeting.\n\nThe aide to the CM wondered if the federal government claimed that inflation was being brought down to one per cent, why the interest rate was still at 11 per cent.\n\nHe said that Rs2-2.5 trillion in savings from interest payments this year should be redirected to development projects—but it was not happening.\n\nMr Aslam complained that according to the planning ministry, 118 development projects had been scrapped, while the government was claiming that the growth rate would be 4.2 per cent next year, with inflation being at 7.5 per cent.\n\nHe said exports wouldn’t increase significantly, but imports would rise, and $39.5 billion in remittances had been estimated.\n\nRegarding budgetary allocations, the aide to the CM said out of Rs1 trillion PSDP, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would receive just Rs540 million.\n\nHe said Sindh had been allocated Rs47.1 billion, Gilgit-Baltistan Rs37 billion and Azad Jammu and KashmirRs45 billion, and the tribal districts just Rs70 billion of which only Rs34 billion had actually been disbursed this year.\n\nMr Aslam said that this year, Punjab’s development budget was Rs1 trillion and Sindh’s Rs1.1 trillion, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s development budget totaled Rs433 billion.\n\nHe said this year alone, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would receive Rs300 billion less from the federal government.\n\nThe chief minister’s adviser said Rs42 billion less had been received under the NFC Award, and the federal government had collected Rs1 trillion less in taxes until May, meaning KP would receive Rs90 billion less this year.\n\nHe demanded that the federal government announce the NFC Award for tribal districts (erstwhile Fata)and immediately provide the share based on population, or at the very least, fulfil the allocations announced in the budget.\n\nMr Aslam said as the parties ruling the centre didn’t form a government in KP, both settled and tribal districts were unfairly denied funds.\n\nHe insisted that the KP government had complied with IMF conditions and even the federal government had acknowledged that.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2025",
