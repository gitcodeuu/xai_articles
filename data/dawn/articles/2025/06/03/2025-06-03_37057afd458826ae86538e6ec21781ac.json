Trump, who wants a swift end to the three-year war, “is open to it (a three-way summit) if it comes to that, but he wants both of these leaders and both sides to come to the table together”, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said in Washington.\n\nAt Monday’s meeting, which lasted just over an hour, Ukraine and Russia agreed to exchange severely injured prisoners of war as well as those under 25, alongside the remains of 6,000 troops killed in combat, Kyiv said.\n\n“These figures given by both Russia and Ukraine… (are) very, very important in terms of showing how important these Istanbul meetings are. And we are proud of this,” Erdogan added.\n\nUkraine and Russia agreed another large-scale prisoner exchange, but failed to make a breakthrough on an immediate halt to the fighting.\n\nAt the second round of direct talks between the warring sides, Ukraine said Moscow had rejected its call for an unconditional ceasefire, offering instead a partial truce of two to three days in some areas of the frontline.\n\nUrged on by US President Donald Trump, Moscow and Kyiv have opened direct negotiations for the first time since the early weeks of Russia’s invasion, but have yet to make progress beyond prisoner exchanges and the agreement to swap their demands for a longer-term settlement.\n\nTop negotiators from both sides confirmed they had reached a deal to swap all severely wounded soldiers as well as all captured fighters under the age of 25.\n\n“We agreed to exchange all-for-all seriously wounded and seriously sick prisoners of war. The second category is young soldiers who are from 18 to 25 years old — all-for-all,” Ukraine’s lead negotiator and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov told reporters in Istanbul.\n\nRussia’s lead negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said it would involve “at least 1,000” on each side — topping the 1,000-for-1,000 POW exchange agreed at talks last month.\n\nBut there was less sign of progress towards a truce.\n\n“The Russian side continued to reject the motion of an unconditional ceasefire,” Ukraine’s Deputy Foreign Minister Sergiy Kyslytsya told reporters after the talks.\n\nRussia said it had offered a limited pause in fighting.\n\n“We have proposed a specific ceasefire for two to three days in certain areas of the front line,” top negotiator Vladimir Medinsky said, adding this was needed to collect bodies of dead soldiers from the battlefield.\n\nNo ‘reward’ for Putin\n\nThe two sides also agreed to hand over the bodies of 6,000 killed soldiers, Ukraine said after the talks.\n\nBut Russia’s Medinsky said Moscow would hand 6,000 killed Ukrainian soldiers over unilaterally, adding that he did not know “if they have any bodies on their side”, but that Russia would take them, if so.\n\nMoscow does not disclose how many of its soldiers have been killed, closely guarding any information on the huge losses sustained during its three-year invasion.\n\nAs talks concluded, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said any deal must not “reward” Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 3rd, 2025",
