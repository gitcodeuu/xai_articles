The heat index was 51 degrees Celsius at 3pm.\n\n“There is a low-pressure area, now over the Indian Gujarat, blocking the sea breeze. We are expecting that weather conditions will improve by tomorrow evening with the resumption of the sea breeze,” explained Met department’s focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham, adding that searing heat would likely subside by Thursday.\n\nHowever, Jacobabad remained the hottest city in the province with 46 degrees Celsius temperature followed by Mohenjo Daro 45.5 degrees Celsius and Dadu 44.5 degrees Celsius.\n\nAccording to the Met department daily advisory, hot and humid but occasionally windy conditions are likely to prevail tomorrow in the city with maximum temperature ranging between 36 and 38 degrees Celsius.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
