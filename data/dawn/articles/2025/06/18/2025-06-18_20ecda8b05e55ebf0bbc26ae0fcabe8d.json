  "content": "LAHORE: Police claimed to have recovered 404kg ice (crystal methamphetamine) in the first five months of this year, far surpassing the total recoveries of the past two years — 61.9kg in 2023 and 175kg in 2024.\n\nThe figures have alarmed the law-enforcement agencies as they fear that if parents keep on leaving the young generation exposed to the highly addictive and dangerous drug (ice), the situation may get from bad to worse in near future.\n\nQuoting some health experts, the police officials say the meth abuse leads to anxiety, insomnia, and violent behaviour, making the youngsters indulge in crime and other violations.\n\nThey say the trend of rash driving, physical assaults, suicide attempts and other serious activities is increasing in the lives of the youngsters, including students, due to the use of the ice in normal get-togethers and in educational institutions.\n\nRecovery surpasses total seizures of 61.9kg in 2023, 175kg in 2024\n\nAccording to an analysis carried out by the Lahore police high-ups, youngsters are introduced to the crystal meth in such gatherings and this practice goes largely unchecked or overlooked by the parents.\n\nAccording to a study, the police say, the international price for meth ranges from $7,000 to $15,000 per kilogram that showed the drug is largely used by the rich class.\n\nHowever, ice is not the only drug seeing a dramatic increase in recovery, as the business of some other dangerous drugs is also on the rise in Lahore.\n\nA broader look at narcotics reveals that recovery of heroin jumped from 168 kg in 2023 and 285 kg in 2024 to 243 kg in the first five months of 2025.\n\nSimilarly, the data shows the opium confiscated by police rose from 125 kg in 2023 and 436kg in 2024 to 232 kg in five months of this year. As drug seizures have soared, the number of drug cases and the arrests made by the Lahore police focused on key suppliers and traffickers.\n\nLahore Operations DIG Faisal Kamran attributed the actions to a “shift from routine enforcement to intelligent, tech-driven strategy.”\n\nThis includes real-time surveillance using modern technology, enhanced coordination among law-enforcement agencies, use of artificial intelligence to identify drug trafficking hotspots, strengthening of community intelligence and informant networks, he said.\n\nMr Kamran said the shift in operational style has not only improved efficiency but also aligns closely with the orders of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz who wants zero tolerance towards the sale of drugs, particularly ice, in the provincial capital.\n\nThe CM had ordered eradication of the drug networks from Lahore by taking firm actions against the emerging threats to the health and lives of the young generations, he said adding that the provincial government also recently imposed a comprehensive ban on e-cigarettes and vapes, citing their harmful effects and growing use among teenagers and young adults.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
