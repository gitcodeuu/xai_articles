The final, slated for November 2, will also be hosted in the Sri Lankan capital should Pakistan qualify.\n\nHowever, if the team does not progress beyond the group stage, the semi-final and final will be held in Guwahati and Bengaluru, respectively.\n\nAs per the ICC, all participating teams will feature in two warm-up matches beginning September 24.\n\nPakistan fixtures:\n\nAll matches to be played at R.
