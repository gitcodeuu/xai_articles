  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Following reservations expressed by his party, the PPP, President Asif Ali Zardari on Tuesday stressed that the federal budget must prioritise the welfare and uplift of the common man, particularly workers and low-income groups.\n\nThe president conveyed these concerns during a meeting with Prime Mi­­nister Shehbaz Sharif at Aiwan-i-Sadr, according to a statement from the Pre­sident’s Secretariat Press Wing. Both discussed the country’s prevailing political and economic situation.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, Planning Min­ister Ahsan Iqbal, Law Mi­­nister Azam Nazeer Tarar and Senator Saleem Ma­­ndviwalla also attended.\n\nDuring the meeting, the PM briefed the president on his recent official visit to the UAE and shared key features of the federal budget.\n\nPresident Zardari underscored that the salaried class, pensioners, labourers and underprivileged groups were facing severe challenges and that effective measures were needed to ease their burden. He also stressed the need for job creation and social protection to support vulnerable communities.\n\nOn Monday, the PPP and MQM-P, both key coalition partners, voiced strong reservations over the budget in the National Assembly, warning “it would be challenging for them to support it in its present form”.\n\nLawmakers from the two Sindh-based parties criticised proposals to expand the tax net, accusing the federal government of neglecting the province, particularly Karachi. They also denounced the Centre’s proposed move to grant the FBR arbitrary powers to act against tax evaders and non-filers.\n\nThe two parties also protested the “step-motherly treatment” with Sindh, citing the lack of development plans for the province and meagre allocation for the under-construction Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway section.\n\nPresident visits PAF HQ\n\nLater, Mr Zardari visited Air Headquarters and met Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu to boost the PAF’s morale following its recent success in defending the country’s airspace against Indian aggression.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
