With this latest funding authorisation, the total allocation for the AIP Programme under the current fiscal year reaches Rs42.315 billion,” the release said.\n\nMinister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal emphasised the significance of the initiative.\n\n“We are unlocking Rs35 billion for the newly-merged areas as one of the biggest investments for the uplift of the area. It’s not just numbers; it’s hope for families who have waited too long for light, for education, for safety.” he said.\n\nThe federal minister said the allocated funds would support a series of transformative projects aimed at bridging development gaps and improving living standards across the region.\n\nHe said key initiatives included the solarisation of off-grid households, with Rs13.5bn set aside to provide solar energy solutions to 120,000 households or implement a 50MW utility-scale micro grid, ensuring sustainable and affordable power access.\n\nThe minister also said Rs7bn had been allocated for the construction of police stations and police posts, including the transformation of Levies forces, to enhance law enforcement capacity and public safety in the region.\n\nHe said the development of Fata University had also been given, with Rs2.5bn earmarked for strengthening its academic and institutional infrastructure, providing youth from the region with greater access to quality higher education.\n\n“Furthermore, an amount of Rs13.145bn, as requested by the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has been authorised to clear outstanding liabilities for ongoing schemes, ensuring the timely completion of critical infrastructure and development projects,” he said.\n\nMr Iqbal said the federal government was committed to inclusive development.\n\n“These are real steps toward a better, brighter future. Our message is simple: newly-merged districts are an important priority of the federal government. We look forward to working with the KP government for the development of a region, which has suffered greatly due to terrorism,” he said.\n\nThe minister said the landmark funding package reaffirmed the federal government’s resolve to uplift underdeveloped regions and integrate them fully into the national development framework, ensuring equitable growth, improved governance, and social cohesion across Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
