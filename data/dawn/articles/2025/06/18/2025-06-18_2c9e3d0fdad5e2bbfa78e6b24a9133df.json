It is our responsibility to ensure they have a secure and peaceful environment to carry out their work,” Mr Gandapur said.\n\nHe said the police department had established strong coordination with the companies executing the Suki Kinari and Balakot hydropower projects to ensure robust security arrangements for Chinese nationals.\n\nDPO says exercise meant to address potential threats to Chinese workers\n\nMeanwhile, the Balakot police launched a crackdown on professional beggars.\n\nThey detained around 50 individuals, mostly women and children, from across Kaghan Valley and sent them to their respective areas.\n\nActing on the directives of the district police officer, the police officials picked up beggars from tourist hotspots such as Lake Saiful Muluk, Lolusar Lake, the banks of the Kunhar River, and Naran.\n\nResidents, tourists and the business community had lodged complaints with the police, alleging that seasonal beggars not only crowd tourist areas but are also involved in immoral activities.\n\nThe detained beggars were warned that strict legal action would be taken if they attempted to return to the valley.\n\nTOURISTS WARNED: Rescue 1122 on Tuesday warned tourists visiting Kaghan Valley against getting closer to the Kunhar River or taking selfies on rocks near the water after three people, including a first-year student, drowned last week.\n\n“Tourists coming to enjoy the natural beauty of Kaghan Valley should avoid going near the river or attempting selfies on rocks by the riverside. No one can swim in its icy waters,” Abrar Ali, district emergency officer of Rescue 1122, told reporters.\n\nHe said three people, including two tourists, drowned in the Kunhar River over the past week, and Rescue 1122 launched immediate operations to retrieve them.\n\n“Until now, we have managed to recover only one body. The search for the remaining two is still underway,” he said.\n\nMr Ali said a common misconception, particularly among tourists and some locals, was that they could swim to safety if they fell into the river.\n\n“This is a dangerous assumption as the glacial water can cause cardiac arrest within seconds due to the extreme cold,” he warned.\n\nThe Kunhar River originates from the glaciers and snow-covered peaks of the upper Kaghan Valley, flowing downstream through Balakot and onward to Muzaffarabad in Azad Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nMr Ali said Rescue 1122 responded to a total of 4,926 calls in the past week and successfully rescued 53 people from various emergencies.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
