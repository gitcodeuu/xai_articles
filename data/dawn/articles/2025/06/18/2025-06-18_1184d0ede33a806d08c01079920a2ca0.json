Heatwaves, intensified by climate change, are becoming more frequent, prolonged and severe, disproportionately affecting communities with limited resources to adapt.\n\nAccording to Rescue 1122 KP spokesperson Bilal Ahmad Faizi, “The ongoing heatwave across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has reached alarming levels, affecting both human lives and the environment.”\n\nHe told Dawn.com that, “A total of 935 people were impacted by the intense heatwave in June, of which 48 were taken to hospitals in critical condition due to heat-related health complications.”\n\nHe added that to mitigate the impact of the heatwave, Rescue 1122 has established 108 anti-heatwave camps across 34 districts of the province.\n\n“The camps are equipped with first aid and hydration facilities to provide immediate relief to those suffering from heat exhaustion or heatstroke,” he said.\n\nRescue 1122 Director General Shah Fahad told Dawn.com, “We have provided necessary facilities in these camps, including first aid and proper hydration support, to help the affected population.”\n\nHe said that the intense heat has caused a spike in forest fires across KP.\n\n“This month, 65 forest fire incidents were reported, with the districts of Lower Dir and Abbottabad being the most affected ones — each reporting 14 separate fire incidents,” he added.\n\nHe continued, “In light of the ongoing heatwave, the provincial government has issued public safety advisories, urging citizens to avoid unnecessary outdoor activities, minimise physical exertion during peak heat hours, and stay hydrated.”\n\nFahad said that the authorities were urging the public to adhere strictly to safety guidelines and cooperate with emergency services to prevent further loss of life and property, as the region grapples with the threat of severe heat and environmental hazards.\n\n“We are coordinating closely with district administrations to address and control forest fire outbreaks.”\n\nPakistan has grappled with an unprecedented surge in forest fires in recent years. Provinces, including KP and Balochistan, have seen huge wildfires in the past three years.\n\nLast month, a massive wildfire that erupted in the mountains of KP’s Adenzai continued to spread, even as efforts were ongoing to put out the raging flames, which damaged precious forests in the previous three days.\n\nAdenzai is a mountainous forest zone located in the Lower Dir district where a wildfire broke out in May last year as well and continued to burn for four to five days.",
