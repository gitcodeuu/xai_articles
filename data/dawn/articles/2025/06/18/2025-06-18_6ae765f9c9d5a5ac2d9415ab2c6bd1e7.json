He urged entomologists to come up with doable solutions backed by tangible research work.\n\nHe added that farmers should be sensitised about the rational usage of pesticides and other agricultural inputs, which would not only increase production but also bring economic stability.\n\nDepartment of Entomology Chairman Dr Waseem Akram said that the sector was in the grip of different challenges. He added that they were running different research projects on dengue, Integrated Pest Management, stored grain pest control, insects and biodiversity.\n\nHe also shared the department’s contributions in dengue control and advisory services for farming communities, along with successful eradication campaigns against fruit fly and mango mealybug.\n\nDr Muhammad Ahsan said the Department of Entomology played a vital role in ensuring sustainable agriculture through innovative strategies. He said that the department was actively contributing to food security by addressing pest-related challenges and enhancing crop protection.\n\nDr Amir Bashir discussed the current challenges in pest management with a focus on application techniques. He called for precise and efficient pesticide application to minimise environmental impact and maximise effectiveness.\n\nCABI-Pakistan Project Manager Dr Kazim Ali highlighted the importance of digitalising pest surveillance and reporting systems in Pakistan. He said that modern digital tools could ensure real-time monitoring and quicker response to pest outbreaks.\n\nDr Rashad Rasul also said that insect pest control had gained significance and called for finding out the most suitable pest control strategies.\n\nDr Muhammad Sagheer stressed the need for Integrated Management of Insect Pests of Stored Products. He said that such advancements would enhance better crop protection strategies across the country.\n\nKILLED: A wanted man was killed allegedly in an encounter with the Rajana police in Toba on a link road near Sunehri Bangla on Tuesday.\n\nIn a press release, the police claimed that four men on two motorcycles were on their way to Rajana, while a police van was coming from the opposite direction. As soon as they saw the van, they hid in a nearby field and opened fire on the policemen. When the firing stopped, police found one of attackers dead and claimed that he died by the bullets fired by his own accomplices.\n\nThe police identified the deceased as Haider Nawaz Gadhi of Chak 184-GB.\n\nIt is to be mentioned that he was not a robber and police said in the press release that he was wanted by Rajana police in two cases of attacking opponents.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
