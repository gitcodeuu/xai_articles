  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday came down hard on the Capital Development Authority (CDA) for its failure to provide designated spaces for licensed pushcart vendors, terming the issue one of dignity and survival for the city’s working poor.\n\nJustice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan heard the petition regarding the renewal of licenses for pushcart vendors.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the court directed the CDA to consult with the petitioners and formulate a viable plan to allocate space for rickshaw stands near the commercial centres of various sectors. The CDA’s legal representative expressed reservations, arguing that pushcart vendors, once allowed into commercial areas, might not vacate the spaces later.\n\nJustice Ejaz Ishaq responded sharply, stating, “If you’re opposing this, then show us examples where you’ve already allocated space. If a letter came from powerful quarters asking you to give away half a sector, you’d sign it quietly to save your jobs.”\n\nAdvocate Imaan Mazari, representing the petitioners, informed the court that the CDA Magistrate had imposed fines of Rs30,000 on pushcart vendors, an amount far beyond their means.\n\nThe court called the fine excessive and urged the CDA to recognise the economic plight of this marginalised community.\n\nJustice Ishaq further remarked, “Not everyone can go to Gloria Jeans for coffee. These chairs you’re removing provide a basic service to ordinary people. This is a matter affecting the livelihood of 20,000 to 30,000 people—how can you be so indifferent?” He criticised the CDA’s selective enforcement of rules, pointing out its double standards in dealing with the elite versus the poor.\n\nThe court directed the CDA to hold meaningful consultations and develop a dignified and workable solution to the issue. The hearing was adjourned until July 2.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
