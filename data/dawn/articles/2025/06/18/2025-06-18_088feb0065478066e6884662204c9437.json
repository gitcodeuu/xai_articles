So it has been decided that the party will not hold any protest for two weeks,” Mr Akram told Dawn.\n\nRaoof Hasan, the head of PTI’s political think tank, stated the global situation, particularly in the Middle East, was rapidly changing.\n\n“It is the need of time to stop all kinds of protests and give a message that the whole nation is united,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
