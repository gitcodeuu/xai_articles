However, lawmakers pointed out that solar panels are not produced locally and questioned the need for early protectionist measures.\n\nMr Qamar and other members warned that taxing solar imports now would limit access to aff­ordable renewable ene­rgy and increase electri­city costs. Mirza Ikhtiar Baig asked why the government would want to deprive the public of cheaper power solutions.\n\nThe National Assem­bly committee members also alleged that ahead of the budget, certain stakeholders had imp­orted and dumped solar equipment in anticipation of the tax hike.\n\nFollowing deliberati­ons, members across party lines agreed to scrap the tax proposal, emphasising that solar panels remain vital for providing affordable electricity.\n\nPakistan is rapidly emerging as a key leader in solar power deployment. The country has boosted solar electricity generation by over three times the global average so far this year, fuelled by a more than fivefold rise in solar capacity imports since 2022, Reuters said, quoting data from the energy think tank Ember.\n\nThat combination of rapidly rising capacity and generation has propelled solar power from Pakistan’s fifth-largest electricity source in 2023 to its largest in 2025.\n\nSo far in 2025, solar power has accounted for 25pc of Pakistan’s utility-supplied electricity, which makes it one of fewer than 20 nations globally that have sourced a quarter or more of monthly electricity supplies from solar farms.\n\nSmall cars, big tax\n\nThe Senate committee also expressed serious concern over the increase in GST from 12pc to 18pc on small vehicles, including 850cc cars.\n\nMr Mandviwalla called the 18pc sales tax on a Rs3 million vehicle “unfair”, a sentiment echoed by several senators. Proposals were discussed to moderate the tax to 14pc or 15pc instead.\n\nSenator Shibli Faraz criticised the inequity, noting that while tax relief is being extended to certain regions, small car owners continue to face high taxation.\n\nHowever, the committee approved a sales tax exemption on aircraft imports as part of PIA privatisation.\n\nThe panels were briefed on proposed changes in the tax fraud definition, which has now been divided into two categories. If a suspect poses a flight risk, authorities will proceed to arrest them.\n\nAdditionally, individuals involved in record tampering or who fail to respond to three official notices will also face detention.\n\nThe FBR will establish a three-member board to review cases before approving arrests.\n\nNo arrests will be made for tax fraud cases involving amounts below Rs50 million.\n\n‘IMF pressure’\n\nDuring the session, MNA Omar Ayub rema­rked that the tariff structure had been altered under IMF pressure.\n\nOn the issue of curbing the sale of illegal cigarettes, the FBR proposed granting law enforcement agencies and the district administration the authority to act against the perpetrators.\n\nHowever, committee members voiced concerns over potential corruption, arguing that delegating such powers could fuel bribery.\n\nFBR Chairman Langrial insisted that enforcement powers must be given to police and local authorities to effectively tackle tax evasion in the tobacco sector.\n\nThe committee members pushed back, warning that such a move could open doors to extortion and suggesting that enforcement remain solely under FBR’s jurisdiction. In a sharp retort, Mr Langrial remarked, “Are our officials somehow incorruptible?”\n\nA heated exchange unfolded during the meeting between MNA Nafisa Shah and the FBR chief. Ms Shah criticised the enforcement measures, likening them to “martial law-style regulations”, asserting such actions cannot be justified under any circumstances.\n\nMr Langrial defended his position, stating, “I serve a democratic government.” He expressed disapproval over Ms Shah’s remarks, noting that using terms associated with martial law was inappropriate.\n\nIn response, Ms Shah insisted on her right to free speech, emphasising that, as a member of the National Assembly, she holds the authority to voice her opinions. “You may defend your institution, but we will exercise our right to express ourselves,” she said.\n\nWhile the federal government aims to levy sales tax on digital services, provincial authorities have expressed reservations, citing their existing 15pc service tax on such businesses. However, FBR officials argued that taxation on online sales falls outside provincial jurisdiction.\n\nFrom the next fiscal year, iron scrap importers will be obligated to sell only to registered manufacturers. Officials said this measure aims to eliminate the misuse of “flying invoices” and commercial manipulation in scrap trade.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
