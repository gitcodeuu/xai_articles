Over half of people under age 35 in the US are relying on social media and video networks as their main source for news, the report found.\n\nAcross the countries that the report surveyed, 44pc of people aged 18 to 24 said these networks are their main source of news.\n\nThe biggest-name chatbot — OpenAI’s ChatGPT — is the most widely used, followed by Google’s Gemini and Meta’s Llama.\n\nRespondents appreciated relevant, personalised news from chatbots.\n\nMany more used AI to summarise (27pc), translate (24pc) or recommend (21pc) articles, while almost one in five asked questions about current events.\n\nDistrust remains, with those polled on balance saying AI risked making the news less transparent, less accurate and less trustworthy.\n\nIn addition, the report found that prominent podcasters like Joe Rogan are playing a bigger role in news dissemination in the United States.\n\nTraditional US news media increasingly risks being eclipsed by online personalities and creators.\n\nOne-fifth of a sampled group of Americans came across news or commentary from podcaster Rogan in the week following the presidential inauguration, the report found, while 14pc of respondents said they had come across former Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson discussing or commenting on news during that period.\n\nDespite their popularity, online influencers and personalities are seen as the biggest sources of false or misleading information worldwide, along with politicians, the report found. In the United States, politicians are considered the biggest sources of false or misleading information.\n\nNews still a draw for X\n\nThe Reuters Institute report also pointed to traditional media — TV, radio, newspapers and news sites — losing ground to social networks and video-sharing platforms.\n\nThe institute found that many are still using Elon Musk-owned social media platform X for news, despite a rightward shift since the world’s richest man took it over.\n\n“Many more right-leaning people, notably young men, have flocked to the network, while some progressive audiences have left or are using it less frequently,” the authors wrote.\n\nSome 23pc of people in the United States reported using X for news, up 8pc on 2024’s survey, with usage also rising in countries like Australia and Poland.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
