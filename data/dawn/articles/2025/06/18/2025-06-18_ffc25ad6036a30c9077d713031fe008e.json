  "content": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday repudiated Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s assessment that Iran has not been building a nuclear weapon, publicly contradicting his spy chief for the first time during his second term.\n\nIn rejecting his top spy’s judgement, Trump appea­red to embrace Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s justification for launching air strikes last week on Iranian nuclear and military targets, saying he believed Tehran was on the verge of having a warhead.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as he returned early to Washington from the G7 summit in Canada, Trump was asked how close he believed Iran was to having a nuclear weapon. “Very close,” he responded.\n\nWhen told that Gabbard testified to Congress in March that the US intelligence community continued to judge that Tehran was not working on a nuclear warhead, Trump replied: “I don’t care what she said. I think they were very close to having one.”\n\nDonald Trump’s comments recalled his clashes with US spy agencies during his first term, including over an assessment that Moscow worked to sway the 2016 presidential vote in his favour and his acceptance of Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denials.\n\nThe office of the Director of National Intelligence did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nTulsi Gabbard also told Congress that US spy agencies did not believe Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, had ordered the restarting of a nuclear weapons programme that the US and the International Atomic Energy Agency assessed ended in 2003.\n\nA source with access to US intelligence reports said the assessment presented by Gabbard had not changed.\n\nThey said that US spy services also judged that it would take up to three years for Iran to build a warhead with which it could hit a target of its choice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 18th, 2025",
