  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The subdivisional police officer (SDPO) of I-9 Islamabad was transferred and charge-sheeted while two station house officers (SHOs) in the area were awarded punishments ranging from suspension, charge-sheeting and forfeiture of two years’ service after security loopholes were noticed by a vigilance team during inspections of Imambargahs, sources said.\n\nThe capital police have prepared a contingency plan to ensure foolproof security arrangements from Muharram 1 to 10, during which 181 processions (18 licensed and 163 traditional — Alam, Zuljinnah, Tazia, and Mehndi) — will be held at various places in the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT).\n\nOf the 181 processions, 16 have been placed in category ‘A’ (most sensitive), 93 in category ‘B’ (less sensitive) and 72 in category ‘C’, according to the security plan.\n\nA vigilance team constituted by the inspector general of police (IGP) conducted a surprise inspection of security arrangements for one procession and found several loopholes: women police officers were not present at their designated duty spots and a security zone had not been created for the protection of women.\n\nIGP warns officials of strict departmental action in case of violation of security plan for Muharram\n\nThe concerned SHO Sabzi Mandi was called via wireless but he did not appear despite being waited for over 30 minutes. As a result, the SHO Sabzi Mandi was reverted, suspended, transferred to the Police Lines Headquarters, and assigned to lock-up duty, sources said.\n\nAt the second site, I-9 Jafaria Imambargah, the security zone was not created in line with the security plan, and security arrangements were found unsatisfactory. Only one police official was present while the other was absent.\n\nParking was arranged too close to the venue in violation of the SOP. The sides of the venue were left open with jungle on both sides and an empty back area. Lighting arrangements were also inadequate.\n\nDue to this negligence and failure to follow the contingency plan, the SHO Sabzi Mandi was suspended and reverted.\n\nThe SDPO I-9 was removed from his post and directed to report to the Police Lines Headquarters, where he was also charge-sheeted.\n\nAdditionally, two years of service of the SHO I-9 were forfeited.\n\nThe IGP Islamabad has directed all SPs, SDPOs and SHOs to personally visit procession and majlis venues to ensure that security duties are being performed in strict accordance with the SOPs.\n\nThe IGP warned that strict departmental action would be taken against any police officers if violations of duty were found. Full implementation of the security SOP directives must be ensured as no negligence will be tolerated.\n\nThe ICT police have already prepared a comprehensive contingency security plan, deploying police in a three-tier system to ensure foolproof security for all 181 processions during Muharram.\n\nAs many as 13 points have been identified as potential trouble spots due to past tensions. In addition, 965 majalis will be held during Muharram.\n\nAt all 13 sensitive points, all SHOs and SDPOs will be personally present to supervise the processions. Special surveys of the routes will be conducted, and any security obstacles will be removed.\n\nGiven the prevailing sectarian tensions, the possibility of a terrorist incident cannot be ruled out, the security plan notes, emphasising the utmost need for extreme vigilance and foolproof security arrangements.\n\nAs part of the security plan, activities of persons connected with banned organisations or those on watch lists (Fourth Schedule) will be strictly monitored. Private individuals and private security companies will not be allowed to carry weapons during Muharram and Safar (two months).\n\nThe entry of 17 Ulema from different sects into the federal capital territory has already been banned for two months. The management and organisers have been officially informed not to invite these Ulema or speakers.\n\nAt Majlis venues and along procession routes, searches will be conducted by organisers under police or magistrate supervision. PRU and Dolphin pairs will be deployed at Imambargahs and Majlis sites armed with double weapons.\n\nAll sectarian speeches will be recorded verbatim for immediate review and possible prosecution under relevant laws. Offenders will be arrested and tried. Videos of main processions will be recorded and no police officer will, under any circumstances, express views or remarks about religious matters that could inflame sectarian feelings.\n\nThe bomb disposal squad will conduct vehicle inspections with special equipment at various times and locations, assisted by local police at checkpoints and at entry points to major markets and hotels.\n\nAll SHOs will personally visit locations where Alam and Tazia are kept to review and ensure security arrangements. Management committees will also be held responsible for the safety and security of these places.\n\nIn Islamabad, the use of loudspeakers is restricted to Azan and Friday sermons. This ban will be enforced strictly. Special permission has been granted for loudspeakers at Majalis, but only at low volume to avoid violations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",
