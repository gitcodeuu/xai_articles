He sustained critical injuries and died on the spot.\n\nThe police arrived at the scene upon receiving information and detained six suspects. They were identified as Talha Mohammed, Hasan alias Arif (a cousin of the deceased), Abdullah, Faraz Sattar, Manan Ali and Moiz Mohammed.\n\nThe body was taken to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for medico-legal procedures.\n\nArea SHO Anser Ahmed Butt told Dawn that the scuffle began between Manan Ali and Abdullah over the profile picture of the latter’s girlfriend being found on the former’s mobile phone. When Abdul Reh­man attempted to inte­rvene, Manan allegedly pushed him. He slipped and fell, hitting his head on the motorcycle, which caused his instant death.\n\nMeanwhile, police on Sunday claimed to have arrested two suspects for allegedly murdering a police constable and setting his body on fire in his North Karachi home in order to conceal their crime. They reportedly killed the constable over some personal enmity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",
