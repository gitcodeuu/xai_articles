We brought merit-based appoi­ntments in the boards of Discos, and took strong action against the corrupt mafia,” he said.\n\n“We settled circular debt after negotiations with banks. When global oil prices were falling, we took advantage and reduced electricity prices,” he added.\n\nPM Shehbaz identified power theft as the biggest remaining challenge, costing the country an estimated Rs500 billion annually.\n\nHe said strong efforts are underway to curb the menace.\n\nThe prime minister concluded by emphasising the government’s commitment to further reducing power tariffs for both industrial and household consumers and called for increased public awareness about the new app.\n\n“It is a revolutionary technology, it will benefit every consumer in every home,” he said, urging the Power Division to raise awareness among consumers about the app.\n\nWith input from APP\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",
