Meanwhile, two people were killed when the roof of a mud house collapsed in Sharifpura.\n\nIn Karachi, three people were electrocuted, while two sisters died after being swept away by floodwaters in the Kargah Nala of Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nThe NEOC warned that significant rainfall may result in urban flooding in low-lying areas of central KP, the Potohar region and Islamabad.\n\nNEOC has also cautioned against possible flash flooding in the northern parts, including the Hazara and Malakand Divisions, lower parts of Jhelum and Poonch Valleys in AJK, and the Pir Panjal range. Furthermore, heavy to very heavy rainfall was forecasted in southern Sindh, particularly affecting Hyderabad, Badin, Thatta, and Karachi from June 29 to July 5.\n\nGlacier melting\n\nIn GB, rapidly melting glaciers pose a constant threat for residents living in downstream areas.\n\nThe local administration said that many households in Tokorkot village in Nagar district have been shifted to safer locations, as the melting glacier near the village has eroded land, damaged agricultural fields, trees, and transmission lines, and put more than 15 homes at risk.\n\nJamal Shahid in Islamabad and Jamil Nagri in Gilgit also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",
