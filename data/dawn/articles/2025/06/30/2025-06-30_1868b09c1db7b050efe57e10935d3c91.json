The government’s recent prioritisation of digitisation as a key lever for growth, development, and economic stability is not just a policy shift; it is an opportunity to transform how the country will operate, serve its citizens, and position itself globally. At the core of this transformation lies the need for advanced, energy-efficient, and secure data centres that can handle the enormous influx of digital activity that this new era demands.\n\nRecent government initiatives, ranging from digital records management and e-governance platforms to online service delivery, are accelerating Pakistan’s transition to a digital-first economy. As national records, citizen databases, financial systems, and institutional processes become increasingly digitised, the demand for scalable, secure, and high-availability data centre infrastructure will surge. This is not just an operational challenge; it is a national economic opportunity.\n\nThe government recently allocated 2,000 megawatts of power to support artificial intelligence (AI) data centres and Bitcoin mining operations. This initiative, driven by the Pakistan Crypto Council under the Ministry of Finance, aims to monetise surplus electricity, attract foreign direct investment, and establish Pakistan as a high-tech global contender. It also sets the stage for data centres to play a catalytic role in reshaping the energy and digital landscapes of the country.\n\nAs international firms scout new territories for expansion, Pakistan presents a promising yet evolving proposition given its strategic geographic location. While the country does not currently offer stable and affordable electricity at scale, its vast untapped renewable energy potential, including solar, wind, and nuclear, opens the door for long-term transformation.\n\nEstablishing specialised centres can address concerns around data sovereignty while creating thousands of direct and indirect jobs driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and economic growth\n\nBy investing in renewable energy integration, stabilising the power grid, and reducing electricity costs through sustainable sources, Pakistan can create a viable foundation for powering future-ready, energy-efficient data centres. As global demand for green and high-performance data infrastructure accelerates, surpassing 100 GW against a current supply of only 15 GW, countries that can offer surplus clean power, available land, and a supportive regulatory environment would stand to benefit the most. With the right policies and public-private collaboration, Pakistan can potentially position itself as a competitive destination for strategic investments across both the energy and digital sectors.\n\nBandwidth capacity is another critical piece of this puzzle. The recent landing of the world’s largest submarine internet cable, the 45,000-kilometre Africa-2 Cable Project, has significantly strengthened Pakistan’s digital connectivity. Connecting 33 countries through 46 landing stations, this project enhances Pakistan’s bandwidth, reduces latency, and ensures resilience through redundant fibre routes. These advancements are essential for the operational continuity of AI data centres, enabling high availability and robust digital service delivery. This enhanced connectivity strengthens our position as potentially one of the most attractive global destinations for data centre investments.\n\nThe shift toward AI, cloud, and high-performance computing will require a robust and diverse ecosystem comprising hyper-scale, regional, and edge data centres. This infrastructure could serve as the backbone for Pakistan’s digital economy, supporting not only large enterprises and government institutions but also empowering start-ups, small and medium-scale enterprises, and local information technology (IT) firms through faster, localised, and secure data processing.\n\nTo realise this potential, the government must assume the role of an enabler and offer clear, business-friendly regulatory frameworks, fiscal incentives, and investment protection mechanisms\n\nWith a population of over 250 million and more than 40m crypto users, Pakistan holds immense potential as a regional leader in digital services. Establishing local AI data centres can address the pressing concerns around data sovereignty, enhance cybersecurity, and elevate digital service delivery. More importantly, it could create thousands of direct and indirect jobs, catalysing the development of a skilled workforce in engineering, IT, and data centres, ultimately driving innovation, entrepreneurship, and inclusive economic growth.\n\nThese developments also present an opportunity to reshape Pakistan’s image on the global stage, from an emerging market to a forward-looking tech nation. By nurturing a strong digital infrastructure, renewable energy integration, and world-class data connectivity, Pakistan can redefine its identity as a regional technology leader capable of exporting digital services and innovation to the world.\n\nMoreover, the development of this sector will drive demand for green and renewable energy solutions. As data centres grow in number and scale, their energy footprint will become increasingly significant. Forward-looking policies such as incentives for energy-efficient and green-certified facilities will be critical in ensuring sustainable growth while attracting both local and foreign investment.\n\nHowever, to fully realise this potential, the government must assume the role of an enabler, not a competitor. Clear, business-friendly regulatory frameworks, fiscal incentives, and investment protection mechanisms will be crucial in fostering private sector participation. A competitive government presence in this space risks crowding out private investment, leading to capital flight, reduced job creation, and slower economic growth.\n\nThe future is not just digital; it is data-driven. And data centres are the engines that could drive Pakistan’s next phase of growth.\n\nThe writer is BU-Head Data Centres, DWP Technologies\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, June 30th, 2025",
