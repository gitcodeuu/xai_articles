There is 80 petabytes of data there, and you can overlay your maps to analyse different geographical variables — from temperature on K2 to thermal imaging,” he explained.\n\nBut this engine has its limitations; the user has to have a certain level of programming and coding expertise to retrieve satellite data and analyse it.\n\nGeoGemma intended to change this — make this data accessible to anyone who wants to analyse it by writing just a few prompts detailing what data they need. Mr Iqbal and his team were able to accomplish this with funding from Google.\n\nAround June last year, he came across a research grant opportunity by Gemma Academic Programme, organised by Google DeepMind, a subsidiary of Google’s parent company Alphabet that works on AI development.\n\nMr Iqbal, Mr Hunzala and their supervisor Dr Sajid Ghaffar formed a GeoAI team and applied for the grant. “[We] pitched our idea of fusing Google Earth Engine with the open-source Gemma model.”\n\nIn September 2024, the team got a $10,000 research grant from Google DeepMind.\n\nAPAC Solution Challenge\n\nGeoGemma was selected as one of the top 10 projects from a pool of 750 entries from over 200 universities. A team from Fast University — who developed a Gemini-powered document editor for neurodivergent users — was the second team from Pakistan to make it to the top 10.\n\nFor the big stage, the team of two needed more resources. They included Abdullah Asif and Khaleelullah, two undergrads studying Computer Science at the IST. Mr Asif joined as the Front-end Web Developer, while Mr Khaleelullah was the tech lead and AI engineer.\n\nSimplifying geospatial analysis\n\nMr Iqbal said GeoGemma is a simplified spatial analysis tool, which can fetch satellite data by understanding prompts in a natural language.\n\n“We are actually pushing boundaries by building a simple model that can even be loaded on computers without the need of servers,” he said, adding the total size of a model is less than 2GB and it can run on any laptop.\n\nHe believes satellite imagery and remote sensing are at the cross-sections of many industries — sustainability, oil and gas, real estate, supply chain, etc.\n\nThe team plans to release their software before the end of this year.\n\n“Right now, we have a solid foundation. We have recognition. We have credibility. But moving forward, there is so much potential in terms of industries we can partner with and make custom modules that’d be proprietary tools,” Mr Iqbal said about the future of GeoGemma.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",
