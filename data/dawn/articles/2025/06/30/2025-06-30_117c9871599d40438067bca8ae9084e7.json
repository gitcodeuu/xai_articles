Mr Haq said the field marshal’s remarks were a powerful demonstration of Pakistan’s bond with the oppressed people of Indian-Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJK).\n\n“His words are a testament to Pakistan’s unwavering moral, diplomatic and political support for the Kashmir cause,” he said, adding that “the people of AJK deeply value this consistent and courageous advocacy, which reflects our shared resolve for a just and peaceful resolution of the longstanding dispute”.\n\nReferring to the field marshal’s observation that the Kashmiri struggle for freedom was a legitimate movement and not terrorism, the AJK premier said: “India may try to malign our struggle with false narratives, but the world knows the difference between a people’s fight for their rights and acts of terror.”\n\n“Our enemy, India, is intoxicated by arrogance and driven by hegemonic ambitions. But the people of Kashmir and Pakistan are united in exposing its lies and resisting its oppression.”\n\nThe AJK prime minister asserted that the armed forces of Pakistan and the Kashmiri people were on the same page when it came to defending the rights of the Kashmiri nation.\n\nReiterating his commitment to the freedom movement, Mr Haq said: “The freedom struggle will continue until the Kashmiris attain their right to self-determination in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and the mission of completing Pakistan is accomplished.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",
