  "content": "Exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, gave on Monday the strongest indication yet that the 600-year-old institution would continue after his death, at prayer celebrations for his 90th birthday.\n\nThe Dalai Lama joined thousands of Buddhist followers on Monday in the prayer celebrations, a landmark event resonating far beyond the Indian Himalayan town where he has lived for decades.\n\n“As far as the institution of the Dalai Lama, there will be some kind of a framework within which we can talk about its continuation,” he said, speaking in Tibetan.\n\nThe leader, who turns 90 on July 6, is according to Tibetans the 14th reincarnation of the Dalai Lama.\n\nHe and thousands of other Tibetans have lived in exile in India since Chinese troops crushed an uprising in the Tibetan capital Lhasa in 1959.\n\nDraped in traditional maroon and yellow robes, the Dalai Lama sat and listened to speeches and chants of monks, nuns, pilgrims, as well as well-wishers from across the world on Monday.\n\n“Though I am 90 years old, physically I am very healthy,” he said, before tasting a slice of Tibetan-style birthday cake, an elaborately decorated tower made from roasted barley and butter cut in front of him.\n\n“In the time I have left, I will continue to dedicate myself to the well-being of others as much as possible,” he said.\n\nThe Dalai Lama’s 90th birthday is more than a personal milestone.\n\nThe charismatic Nobel Peace Prize-winning Buddhist Tenzin Gyatso is also expected to reveal if there will be another Dalai Lama after him.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has said the institution will continue only if there is popular demand — and is widely expected to reveal that decision on Wednesday.\n\nThe occasion carries profound weight not only for Tibetans, but also for global supporters who see the Dalai Lama as a symbol of non-violence, compassion and the enduring struggle for Tibetan cultural identity under Chinese rule.\n\n“We offer our fervent devotions that Tenzin Gyatso, protector of the Land of Snows, lives for one hundred eons,” a chorus of red-robed monks sang.\n\n“May all your noble aspirations be fulfilled,” they added, in front of a crowd that included religious leaders of many faiths.\n\nHis advancing age has also sparked concern over the future of Tibetan leadership and the delicate question of his succession.\n\nThe Dalai Lama has been lauded by his followers for his tireless campaign for greater autonomy for Tibet, a vast high-altitude plateau in China about the size of South Africa.\n\nThe Dalai Lama handed over political authority in 2011 to an exiled government chosen democratically by 130,000 Tibetans globally.\n\nAt the same time, he warned that the future of his spiritual post faced an “obvious risk of vested political interests misusing the reincarnation system”.",
