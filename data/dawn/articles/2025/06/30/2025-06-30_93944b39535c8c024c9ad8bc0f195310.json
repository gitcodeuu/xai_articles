They can have, you know, in a matter of months, I would say, a few cascades of centrifuges spinning and producing enriched uranium, or less than that,” Grossi told CBS News.\n\nHe noted that while strikes on facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan significantly set back Iran’s abilities, its nuclear knowledge is irreversible.\n\n“You cannot disinvent this. You cannot undo the knowledge that you have or the capacities that you have,” Mr Grossi said.\n\nThe war killed at least 627 civilians in Iran and injured 4,900, according to Iran’s health ministry.\n\nRetaliatory missile attacks by Iran killed 28 people in Israel, Israeli authorities said.\n\nOne of the deadliest single events of the war was an Israeli strike last Monday on Tehran’s Evin prison, which Iran’s judiciary said on Sunday killed at least 71 people.\n\nThe victims included staff, guards, prisoners, and visiting relatives.\n\nThe facility is known for holding political prisoners and foreign nationals.\n\nFrench Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot called the strike “unacceptable” but said two detained French nationals held at Evin for three years were not believed to have been harmed.\n\nIran’s prison authority said it transferred an unspecified number of inmates out of the prison after the attack.\n\nThe fighting derailed nuclear talks between Iran and the United States, a staunch ally of Israel. US president, who announced the ceasefire, has threatened further stri­kes if Iran enriches uranium to worrisome levels.\n\nAccording to the IAEA, Iran enriched uranium to 60pc in 2021, far beyond the 3.67pc limit set by the 2015 nuclear deal from which the US unilaterally withdrew in 2018.\n\nUranium enriched to 90pc is needed to produce a nuclear weapon.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 30th, 2025",
