Are we going to see a repetition of an act of aggression while we are engaging in dialogue?”\n\nThe US needed to be “quite clear on this very important question”, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, US President Donald Trump said he was not offering Iran anything nor talking to it “since we totally obliterated” the country’s nuclear facilities.\n\n“I am not offering Iran anything, unlike Obama,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\nThe two countries were in talks over Tehran’s nuclear programme when Israel hit Iranian nuclear sites and military infrastructure earlier this month, with the US joining by bombing three nuclear sites — Fordo, Natanz and Isfahan — on June 21.\n\nAt least 935 people were killed in Iran during its 12-day war with Israel, Iranian state media reported today, nearly a week since a ceasefire took hold. “During the 12-day war waged by the Zionist regime against our country, 935 martyrs have been identified so far,” the official IRNA news agency quoted judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir as saying, adding that the death toll included 132 women and 38 children.\n\nThe deputy minister revealed to the BBC that the US had signalled it did “not want to engage in regime change” by targeting Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nTakht-Ravanchi also said Iran should still be allowed to enrich uranium.\n\n“The level of that can be discussed, the capacity can be discussed, but to say that you should not have enrichment, you should have zero enrichment, and if you do not agree, we will bomb you, that is the law of the jungle,” he said.\n\nIsrael claims that Iran’s nuclear programme is close to producing a bomb, whereas Tehran says it is for peaceful purposes.\n\nIt is not clear yet how much damage the strikes inflicted on Iran’s nuclear facilities, which Trump had said were “totally obliterated”.\n\nUN nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said Iran would probably be able to begin to produce enriched uranium “in a matter of months”.\n\nTakht-Ravanchi said he did not know how long it would take.\n\nUnder a 2015 deal, Iran was allowed to enrich uranium below 3.67 per cent purity for fuel for commercial nuclear power plants.\n\nTrump abandoned the agreement in 2018 and Iran responded by producing uranium enriched to 60 pc — above levels for civilian usage but still below weapons grade.\n\nThat material, if further refined, would theoretically be sufficient to produce more than nine nuclear bombs.",
