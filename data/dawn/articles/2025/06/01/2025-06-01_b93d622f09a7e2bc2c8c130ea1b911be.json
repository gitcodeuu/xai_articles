Therefore, the victim’s brother gunned down the woman at the behest of his father.\n\nThe body of the victim was shifted to THQ Hospital in Pind Dadan Khan for postmortem examination while a case was registered on behalf of the police under the complaint of Sub-Inspector Sarwar Mehdi Gondal, posted at Civil Lines police station in Jhelum.\n\nTalking to Dawn, District Police Officer (DPO) Jhelum Tariq Aziz Sindhu said the woman had been killed in the name of ‘honour.’\n\nHe said all three brothers of the deceased woman worked in Saudi Arabia, and the suspect had returned to Pakistan five days ago with the plan to kill his sister and escape back to Saudi Arabia.\n\nDPO Sindhu said the suspect had fled the scene after committing the crime and reached Islamabad airport to flee abroad, as he had booked a return ticket.\n\nDPO Sindhu said as soon as the police came to know about his overseas status, immigration authorities of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) were alerted at nearby airports, and he was successfully arrested within eight hours while attempting to board the plane from Islamabad.\n\nThe DPO said the suspect was handed over to Jalalpur Sharif police by FIA and further investigations are underway, maintaining that the investigation team would be awarded prize money for swift action.\n\nMeanwhile, police have also arrested the victim’s father for allegedly coercing his son to kill his sister.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 1st, 2025",
