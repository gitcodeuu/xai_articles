Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan have adopted national governance plans and policies on digital and AI technologies.\n\nThe report said policy research is needed to ensure that AI and digital technologies include everyone in South Asia, even the region’s poor.\n\nBarriers to achieving this goal include bottlenecks in institutions and infrastructure, combined with market failures within food systems such as limited digital infrastructure, concentration of market power, and issues with data governance and privacy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 1st, 2025",
