He reiterated the government’s commitment to public-private partnerships in order to ensure that maritime expansion contributes to economic growth and help the country meet global climate targets.\n\n“The Pakistan Business Council supports the proposal to establish a maritime chamber of commerce,” Junaid Anwar said.\n\nShip agents association\n\nThe Pakistan Ships Agents Association (PSAA) has also welcomed the move by the ministry for an umbrella body to bring all stakeholders at one platform.\n\n“Currently there is no unified platform for the sector. We have industry-wise associations, but the maritime sector does not have any representation at any forum,” said Muhammad Rajpar, the association’s chairman. He added that different stakeholders hold meetings under a number of platforms, but establishing a chamber would bring in broader representation on a permanent basis.\n\nAs pointed out by Mr Rajpar, combined meetings of stakeholders are held regularly under the aegis of two main port authorities in the country – Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA). But invitations are extended to key players only.\n\nMeanwhile, a senior KPT official acknowledged that the combined meetings are held on the basis of their business, highlighting that environmental activists are not involved in meetings with the terminal operators or with those engaged in a work of “technical nature”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 1st, 2025",
