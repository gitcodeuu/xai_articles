He directed to make the interchange more attractive and decorative lighting be installed to further improve its appearance.\n\nThe project for extension of Faizabad Interchange was approved by the interior minister in April this year. The project includes the addition of two new lanes and widening of the current infrastructure aimed at significantly reducing traffic bottlenecks and ensuring a smoother commute for tens of thousands of daily travellers.\n\nThe interchange connecting Islamabad Highway and Murree Road was completed in 1998 and serves as a major entry and exit point to Islamabad and Rawalpindi. During protests, long marches and sit-ins in the last few decades, Faizabad remained the centre of focus as the police blocked it with containers.\n\nOn May 28, the interior minister along with Minister of State Tallal Chaudhry, had visited the CDA offices to receive a briefing on the proposed development projects in the capital city.\n\nThe interior ministers were informed by the CDA officials that tenders had been floated for the repair and improvement work of the Faizabad Interchange and after completing the procedural requirements, work would be awarded to the lowest bidder.\n\nIn the same meeting, the participants had approved the designs of Kashmir Chowk and Shaheen Chowk underpasses.\n\nElectric buses on Google map\n\nMeanwhile, the CDA chairman has directed to provide complete information about all electric bus routes, stations and schedules on Google maps so that commuters would benefit more from the environment-friendly travel service.\n\nHe issued the directive while chairing a meeting attended by the board members. He said all buses should be visible on Google Maps with their colours and details of stops to make it easier for passengers to identify them and get information about their arrival times.\n\nMr Randhawa also directed that the payment through debit cards should also be made possible. Moreover, he directed to introduce special packages and discount cards for passengers who want to get weekly, monthly and quarterly cards.\n\nThe chairman also directed to introduce special package for daily wagers, students and senior citizens.\n\nHe was informed that the electric bus project was running successfully, with ridership exceeding initial estimates, reaching about 95,000.\n\nMr Randhawa said all possible steps will be taken to make the service at par with international standards. He also directed to identify and introduce more bus routes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 1st, 2025",
