However, as they failed to detach the iron frame from the signal, the ladder leaned towards the track.\n\nStrangely, none of the railway officials noticed the leaning iron frame that could cause an accident and no measure to fix it was taken.\n\n14 of them hospitalised with serious injuries\n\nAs a result, the passengers who were travelling with their arms and elbows partially out of the train windows, were hit by the leaning iron ladder.\n\nAs per sources, 17 passengers of the Musa Park and Awami Express trains were injured in the incident. Of them, two identified as Usman (41), Ramzan (62) and as many unidentified were provided first aid by Rescue 1122 teams arriving at the scene, while 14 including Ali Murtaza (42), Salman (28), Ghulam Zamin (45), Mubashir (32), Mahmood (36), Asif (22), Afzal (32), Salim (30), Owais (25), Wazir (50), Iqbal (50), Asghar (50) and Halima (15), were admitted to Civil Hospital, Khanewal, where they were stated to be stable.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 21th, 2025",
