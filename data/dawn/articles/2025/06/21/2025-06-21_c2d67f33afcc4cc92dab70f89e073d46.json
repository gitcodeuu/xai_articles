He urged the United Nations to play its role in securing a ceasefire.\n\nMr Ayub said the Iran-Israel conflict was also adversely affecting the world. “In case the war prolongs, the world will have only 12 days of oil reserves left,” he added.\n\nHe noted that Iran produces around four million barrels of oil per day, accounting for over a third of the global daily consumption of 10.4 million barrels.\n\nAllama Raja Nasir said the United States knew that Iran was not producing nuclear weapons. “This is all part of a plan for Greater Israel,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 21th, 2025",
