UN agencies and major aid groups have refused to cooperate with it over concerns it was designed to cater to Israeli military objectives.\n\nElsewhere in the territory on Friday, Bassal said 14 people were killed in two separate strikes in and around the central city of Deir el-Balah, and 13 others in three Israeli air strikes in the Gaza City area.\n\nOne of those strikes, which killed three people, hit a phone charging station in the city, Bassal said.\n\nIn southern Gaza, two people were killed “by Israeli gunfire” in two separate incidents, he added.\n\nIsraeli restrictions on media in the Gaza Strip and difficulties in accessing some areas mean AFP is unable to independently verify the tolls and details provided by the civil defence agency.\n\n‘Israel using hunger as a weapon’\n\nIn a statement on Friday, the Hamas group, which says Israel is using hunger as a weapon against the population of Gaza, accused Israel of systematically targeting Palestinians seeking food aid across the enclave.\n\nMeanwhile, Unicef, the UN’s children’s agency, warned in Geneva of drought conditions developing in Gaza.\n\n“Children will begin to die of thirst … Just 40pc of drinking water production facilities remain functional,” Unicef spokesperson James Elder told reporters. “We are way below emergency standards in terms of drinking water…”\n\nUnicef also reported a 50pc increase in children aged six months to five years admitted for treatment of malnutrition from April to May in Gaza, and half a million people going hungry.\n\nElder, who was recently in Gaza, said he had many testimonials of women and children injured while trying to receive food aid, including a young boy who was wounded by a tank shell and later died of his injuries.\n\nA lack of public clarity on when the sites — some of which are in combat zones — are open is causing mass casualty events, he added.\n\nAl-Quds Brigades said on Friday it had targeted an Israeli military post in the southern city of Khan Yunis, claiming “dead and wounded” Israeli troops as a result. Contacted by AFP, the Israeli military did not comment.\n\nMuch of Khan Yunis, like vast areas across Gaza, is under Israeli military evacuation orders.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 21st, 2025",
