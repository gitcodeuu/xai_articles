  "content": "KARACHI: Although India had always insisted the Kashmir issue was its internal matter, following the May escalation between the two countries, the world had come to realise that it is an international issue, former foreign minister Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said on Friday.\n\nSpeaking to his supporters upon his return from a high-powered diplomatic mission to Western capitals, the PPP chairman said Pakistan had achieved a major diplomatic victory, while India had suffered a clear defeat.\n\nPakistan’s narrative had prevailed, not only in diplomatic circles, but also across international media, he claimed.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by Bilawal House, the ex-foreign minister said he had fulfilled his promise of exposing India’s provocations and Narendra Modi’s falsehoods before the world community.\n\nNew Delhi must accept the Indus Waters Treaty, and if it refuses to honour the treaty, we will fight another war and take all six rivers. “We know how to defend our rivers,” he declared.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 21th, 2025",
