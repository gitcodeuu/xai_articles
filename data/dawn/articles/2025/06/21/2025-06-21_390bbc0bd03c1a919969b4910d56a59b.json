  "content": "At least eight people were killed on Saturday when a hot air balloon with 21 passengers caught fire in southern Brazil, said the governor of Santa Catarina state, where the incident occurred.\n\n“Eight fatalities and 13 survivors,” Governor Jorginho Mello said on X.\n\nVideos taken by bystanders and carried on Brazilian television showed the moment when the balloon erupted in flames above the coastal town of Praia Grande. The weather conditions were clear. The basket carrying the passengers plummeted dozens of meters to the ground in flames.\n\n“We still have no information” about the condition of the survivors, a spokeswoman for Santa Catarina firefighters told AFP.\n\nPraia Grande, on the Atlantic coast, is a popular destination for hot-air ballooning in Brazil.\n\nThe survivors were being treated in area hospitals, firefighters said. An investigation was launched to determine the cause of the accident.\n\n“I want to express my solidarity with the families of the victims,” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva said in a statement.\n\nThe pilot told officials that the fire was sparked by a blowtorch in the basket, Tiago Luiz Lemos, a police official in Praia Grande, told local media.\n\nThe pilot tried to bring the balloon down as soon as the fire erupted, “and once it was close to the ground, he told the passengers to jump from the basket. But some of them couldn’t do it and the fire grew,” the official said.\n\nOne witness told the Razao newspaper that he saw “two people falling, they were on fire, the basket broke off and the balloon fell”.\n\nIt was the second fatal balloon accident in the country in just a few days. Less than a week ago, a woman died during a ride in southeastern Sao Paulo state.",
