Pakistan 1, featuring defending Asian 6-Red singles champion Awaisullah and Asif, the nation’s most decorated cueist, responded positively in the second frame, securing it 42-75 to level the match.\n\nHowever, Malaysia regained the initiative decisively in the third frame (65-25) and then sealed their place in the final by dominating the fourth frame with a significant 65 break [84(65)-47].\n\nAsif and Awaisullah’s run, which included topping their group and a victory over compatriots Shahid Aftab and Mohammad Sajjad in the quarter-finals, earned them a place on the podium. This adds to the bronze medal secured earlier by Asif in the singles event.-\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
