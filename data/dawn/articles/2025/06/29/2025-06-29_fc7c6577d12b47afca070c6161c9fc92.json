It argues that, under Article 19(a) of the Constitution and the Right to Information Act, the public has the right to know under what legal authority government doctors — who are full-time public servants — are permitted to engage in private practice at hospitals and clinics.\n\nThe chief and health secretaries, and the Balochistan Healthcare Commission have been named as respondents in the petition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
