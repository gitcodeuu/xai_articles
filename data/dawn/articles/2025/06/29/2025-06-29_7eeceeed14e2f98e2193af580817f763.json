  "content": "BANGKOK: Thousands of anti-government protesters rallied in the Thai capital Bangkok on Satur­day, demanding Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra resign after a leaked diplomatic phone call stirred public anger.\n\nA Cambodian elder statesman leaked a call meant to soothe a border spat between the two nations in which Paetongtarn called him “uncle” and referred to a Thai military commander as her “opponent”.\n\nA key party abandoned Paeton­g­tarn’s coalition, accusing the 38-year-old dynastic premier of kowtowing to Cambodia and undermining Thai­land’s military, leaving her teetering with a slim parliamentary majority.\n\nAbout 10,000 demonstrators jammed roads ringing the capital’s Victory Monument, waving Thai flags and placards reading “Evil PM, get out”.\n\nOne speaker took to the stage and shouted: “PM, you committed treason!”\n\nThe crowd was mostly senior-aged and led by veteran activists of the “Yellow Shirt” movement, which helped oust Paetongtarn’s father Thaksin in the 2000s.\n\nOne of Thaksin’s former allies, now among his harshest critics, was also a key organiser.\n\n“I’m here to protect Thailand’s sovereignty and to say the PM is unfit,” said 70-year-old protester Seri Sawangmue, who travelled overnight by bus from the country’s north to attend. “After I heard the leaked call I knew I couldn’t trust her,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
