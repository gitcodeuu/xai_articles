Today, a 12th body was recovered, leaving one person who remains missing.\n\nSeparately, the body of a young man who drowned in a flooded river in Lower Dir two days ago has been recovered in Charsadda, according to Faizi.\n\n“The rescue team had been conducting continuous search operations for the past two days, after which the body was found,” Faizi said.\n\nIn yet another incident, two youth drowned in the Indus River in Balyani Akazai in KP’s Hazara division.\n\nAccording to rescue spokesperson Rabnawaz Yousufzai, one youth jumped into the river to cool off from the heat. A second youth saw him drowning and jumped in to rescue him, but both were swept away by the strong current.\n\nA third youth also jumped in to save his companions but was unsuccessful and barely managed to return to the river bank.\n\nFollowing the incident, locals are helping search for the missing bodies.\n\nMore rain is expected in the next 24-48 hours across most districts of KP, according to a statement from KP PDMA.\n\nFlooding is expected in Swat, Chitral, Abbotabad, Mansehra, Peshawar, Bannu and Waziristan. An increase in the water level is expected in Swat River and Panjokra River and its tributaries, PDMA said.\n\nLow-level flooding is expected in the Kabul River over the next 48 hours.\n\n“Land sliding and flooding in local rivers and canals is likely in mountainous areas. PDMA has issued alerts to district administrations to take precautionary measures,” the statement said.\n\nRescue 1122 and other relief teams have been directed to utilise all available resources.\n\nPDMA has directed local administration to control traffic at sensitive places and highways, as well as direct travelers on national highways and provincial highways to take precaution. It was also directed that alternative routes be made for traffic flow.\n\n“Ensure the cleanliness of rivers and drains and drainage systems to avoid urban flooding,” PDMA said.\n\nThe public was requested to take shelter in safe places during wind, hail and thunderstorms, while institutions were directed to disseminate weather alerts in local languages.\n\nFarmers were directed to harvest crops early and store them in safe places, while cattle farmers were directed to protect their livestock.\n\n“PDMA’s Emergency Operations Center is fully functional.
