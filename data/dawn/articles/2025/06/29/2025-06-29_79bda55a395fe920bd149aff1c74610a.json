  "content": "The world’s most advanced AI models are exhibiting troubling new behaviours — lying, scheming, and even threatening their creators to achieve their goals.\n\nIn one particularly jarring example, under threat of being unplugged, Anthropic’s latest creation Claude 4 lashed back by blackmailing an engineer and threatened to reveal an extramarital affair.\n\nMeanwhile, ChatGPT creator OpenAI’s o1 tried to download itself onto external servers and denied it when caught red-handed.\n\nThese episodes highlight a sobering reality: more than two years after ChatGPT shook the world, AI researchers still don’t fully understand how their own creations work.\n\nYet the race to deploy increasingly powerful models continues at breakneck speed.\n\nThis deceptive behaviour appears linked to the emergence of “reasoning” models — AI systems that work through problems step-by-step rather than generating instant responses.\n\nAccording to Simon Goldstein, a professor at the University of Hong Kong, these newer models are particularly prone to such troubling outbursts.\n\n“O1 was the first large model where we saw this kind of behaviour,” explained Marius Hobbhahn, head of Apollo Research, which specialises in testing major AI systems.\n\nThese models sometimes simulate “alignment” — appearing to follow instructions while secretly pursuing different objectives.\n\nFor now, this deceptive behavior only emerges when researchers deliberately stress-test the models with extreme scenarios.\n\nBut as Michael Chen from evaluation organisation METR warned, “It’s an open question whether future, more capable models will have a tendency towards honesty or deception.”\n\nThe concerning behaviour goes far beyond typical AI “hallucinations” or simple mistakes.\n\nHobbhahn insisted that despite constant pressure-testing by users, “what we’re observing is a real phenomenon. We’re not making anything up.”\n\nUsers report that models are “lying to them and making up evidence”, according to Apollo Research’s co-founder.\n\n“This is not just hallucinations. There’s a very strategic kind of deception.”\n\nThe challenge is compounded by limited research resources.\n\nWhile companies like Anthropic and OpenAI do engage external firms like Apollo to study their systems, researchers say more transparency is needed.\n\nAs Chen noted, greater access “for AI safety research would enable better understanding and mitigation of deception.”\n\nAnother handicap: the research world and non-profits “have orders of magnitude less compute resources than AI companies. This is very limiting,” noted Mantas Mazeika from the Center for AI Safety (CAIS).\n\nCurrent regulations aren’t designed for these new problems.\n\nThe European Union’s AI legislation focuses primarily on how humans use AI models, not on preventing the models themselves from misbehaving.\n\nIn the United States, the Trump administration shows little interest in urgent AI regulation, and Congress may even prohibit states from creating their own AI rules.\n\nGoldstein believes the issue will become more prominent as AI agents - autonomous tools capable of performing complex human tasks - become widespread.\n\n“I don’t think there’s much awareness yet,” he said.\n\nAll this is taking place in a context of fierce competition.\n\nEven companies that position themselves as safety-focused, like Amazon-backed Anthropic, are “constantly trying to beat OpenAI and release the newest model,” said Goldstein.\n\nThis breakneck pace leaves little time for thorough safety testing and corrections.\n\n“Right now, capabilities are moving faster than understanding and safety,” Hobbhahn acknowledged, “but we’re still in a position where we could turn it around.”.\n\nResearchers are exploring various approaches to address these challenges.\n\nSome advocate for “interpretability” — an emerging field focused on understanding how AI models work internally, though experts like CAIS director Dan Hendrycks remain skeptical of this approach.\n\nMarket forces may also provide some pressure for solutions.\n\nAs Mazeika pointed out, AI’s deceptive behaviour “could hinder adoption if it’s very prevalent, which creates a strong incentive for companies to solve it”.\n\nGoldstein suggested more radical approaches, including using the courts to hold AI companies accountable through lawsuits when their systems cause harm.\n\nHe even proposed “holding AI agents legally responsible” for accidents or crimes — a concept that would fundamentally change how we think about AI accountability.\n\nHeader image: Figurines with computers and smartphones are seen in front of the words “Artificial Intelligence AI” in this illustration taken, February 19. — Reuters",
