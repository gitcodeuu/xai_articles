State-run Press TV showed an image of ballistic missiles on display. Mass prayers were later held in the square.\n\nState TV said the funeral, dub­bed the “procession of the Martyrs of Power”, was held for a total of 60 people killed in the war, including four women and four children.\n\nLarge crowds of mourners dressed in black line streets in Tehran\n\nIn attendance were President Masoud Pezeshkian and other senior figures, including Ali Sham­khani, who was seriously wounded during the conflict and is an adviser to Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as well as Khamenei’s son Mojtaba.\n\nThere was no immediate statement from Khamenei, who has not appeared publicly since the conflict began. In past funerals, he led prayers over the coffins of senior commanders ahead of public ceremonies broadcast on state television.\n\nBagheri, Salami and Hajizadeh were killed on June 13, the first day of the war. Bagheri was being buried at the Behesht Zahra cemetery outside Tehran mid-afternoon on Saturday. Salami and Hajizadeh were due to be buried on Sunday.\n\nAccording to Iranian health ministry figures, 610 people were killed on the Iranian side in the war before a ceasefire went into effect on Tuesday. More than 4,700 were injured.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
