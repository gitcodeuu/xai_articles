This collaboration with BAEC is a strong example of how strategic public-private partnerships can lead to meaningful change.”\n\nIn her remarks, Balochistan Education Minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani, who was also the chief guest, appreciated the collaboration between AKU-EB and BAEC, describing it as a strong model of institutional partnership.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
