Deceased was murdered with a sharp-edged knife on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the FIR, deceased’s wife, who was out of house and when came back, found her husband tied with a rope and severely injured. She informed Rescue 1122, which shifted Fahim to Polyclinic where he was declared dead.\n\nAccording to police sources, samples from the body have been sent to Lahore for chemical examination.\n\n“Moreover, CCTV footage of different houses has also been checked and geo fencing done to identify the culprits, but so far the police could not collect any concrete information, therefore, two SSPs have been assigned to investigate the case and submit a report,” the sources said.\n\nMurder of Faheem Sardar, who was son of a retired brigadier, is being considered a high profile case, and the police have refused to share the details of the incident. Deceased was working in a government think-tank which focuses on national security and strategy. On the other hand police have not found any evidence that it was an incident of premeditated murder or out of theft.\n\nAccording to reports, earlier deceased served as CEO of Askari Securities for almost a decade.
