  "content": "LONDON: The world’s largest group of oil producers, Opec+, is set to announce another big increase of 411,000 barrels per day in production for August as it looks to regain market share, four delegates from the group told Reuters.\n\nIf the increase is agreed, it would bring the total rise in supply from Opec+ to 1.78 million bpd so far this year, equivalent to over 1.5pc of total global demand. The group has not yet increased production by the volumes agreed because some members are compensating for previous overproduction and others need longer to bring output back online.\n\nThe group has made a radical change in policy this year, after several years of output cuts totalling more than 5 million bpd. This came when eight members started to unwind their most recent output cut of 2.2 million bpd starting in April and accelerated the production hikes in May, June and July, despite the extra supply weighing on crude prices.\n\nThe change came after some members, such as Kazakhstan, produced way over their targets, angering other members that were sticking more closely to agreed cuts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
