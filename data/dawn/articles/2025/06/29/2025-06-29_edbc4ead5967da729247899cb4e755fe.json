  "content": "KARACHI: While the city received moderate to heavy showers when the current monsoon spell touched its peak on Saturday, two more persons died in rain-related incidents.\n\nThe maximum rain recorded in Karachi was 58.2mm, or 2.29 inches, in Surjani Town.\n\nRainwater accumulated on all major roads and streets in almost every part of the metropolis, slowing vehicular traffic and piling miseries on motorists, commuters, and pedestrians alike, who struggled to reach their destinations.\n\nThe city traffic police also advised people to avoid unnecessary travel. They asked drivers to not take sudden brakes while on the road, as the roads may become slippery. Motorcyclists were urged to use the left side of the road only.\n\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed confirmed the death of two persons in the city on Saturday in rain-related incidents.\n\nKarachi receives 2.2 inches of rainfall\n\nShe said a man, Gulban, 30, died after suffering an electric shock in New Karachi, Sector 11-J. The body was brought to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities.\n\nArea SHO Mohammed Saud said that the incident occurred in the victim’s home. He said that he originally hailed from Umerkot.\n\nIn another incident, a teenager was electrocuted in Korangi.\n\nAn Edhi Foundation spokesperson said in a statement that Mudasir Khan, 17, died when he suffered an electric shock near Murtaza Chowrangi, Bilal Colony.\n\nKorangi Industrial Area SHO Mohammed Ali Niazi said that no one approached the police for initiating any legal proceedings.\n\nIn the evening, two persons were killed when the roof of their house collapsed in Lyari.\n\nThe Edhi Foundation said that the incident took place in Moosa Lane near Kausar Masjid.\n\nPower breakdowns persist\n\nThere is no respite from power failures as many city areas have experienced hours-long outages due to what K-Electric officials described as tripping of feeders and localised faults.\n\nThe KE conceded that over 300 feeders tripped due to the rain.\n\nIn a statement, it said Karachi continues to experience gusty winds and intermittent showers, but the power supply system has remained largely stable. “Over 1,800 of KE’s 2,100 plus feeders have continued to operate without interruption.”\n\nKE Spokesperson Imran Rana said: “Restoration efforts began as soon as conditions allowed, with the majority of affected areas promptly re-energised.”\n\n“We urge citizens to continue exercising caution around electrical infrastructure. Avoid contact with low-hanging TV and internet wires, entangled cables, streetlight poles, and wet switches to stay safe during and after the rains,” he added.\n\n‘Weather system to lose intensity today’\n\nAccording to the Met department’s data, the maximum rain was recorded in Surjani Town 58.2mm followed by Saadi Town 47.5mm, Gulshan-i-Maymar 37.4mm, Gulshan-i-Hadeed 37mm, North Karachi 30mm, Jinnah Terminal 29.2mm, PAF Base Faisal 31mm, Korangi 25.2mm, DHA Phase VII 25.5mm, Met Office University Road 24mm, Nazimbad 20.5mm, old airport area 18.2mm, Orangi Town 19.4mm, , Kaemari 18.5mm, PAF Masroor Base 10mm and Bahria Town 6.3mm.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Chief Meteorologist Ameer Hyder Laghari said that the system was going through its peak period on Saturday and expected to gradually lose its intensity from Sunday (tomorrow).\n\n“Unexpectedly, it reached Karachi early due to persisting heat and a low pressure area prevailing over the region,” he said, adding that the next monsoon spell is expected to hit Sindh in the first week of July.\n\nAccording to the Met department’s advisory, strong monsoon currents continue to penetrate over the province and thunderstorm/rain with few moderate to isolated heavy falls are expected on Sunday during the evening and night in several cities including Hyderabad, Karachi, Thatta, Sujawal, Ghotki, Tharparkar, Sanghar, Mirpurkhas, Umerkot and Khairpur.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
