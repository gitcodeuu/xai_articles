  "content": "MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government has decided to launch a comprehensive public awareness campaign ahead of the impending monsoon season, alongside robust emergency preparedness measures to minimise potential loss of life and property.\n\nThe decisions were taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and attended by three cabinet members, the chief secretary, and heads and representatives of all relevant departments.\n\nA central control room will be established to coordinate swift responses to any monsoon-related emergencies. It will include representatives from the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), Health Department, Police, District Administration, Highways, and other key emergency relief agencies.\n\nTo ensure timely and effective communication, the Information Department will spearhead a public awareness campaign to educate citizens on precautionary measures, both before and during the rainy season.\n\n“People must be repeatedly reminded to adopt safety measures, especially avoiding riverbanks and low-lying areas vulnerable to flooding,” the prime minister stressed, directing the issuance of timely warnings and relocation notices to at-risk communities.\n\nIt was revealed during the meeting that rainfall was expected to be 10–15 per cent higher than average this year, significantly increasing the risk of flash floods and cloudbursts in mountainous and streamside areas.\n\nIn light of this, the SDMA and Local Government and Rural Development Department were tasked with ensuring the pre-monsoon cleaning of stormwater drains across the region. Local-level emergency committees will also be established to supplement the work of the central control room and improve grassroots-level coordination.\n\nThe prime minister also directed that alternative accommodation arrangements be made in advance for populations at risk of displacement. He further ordered regular monitoring of water flow at key entry points of the Neelum and Jhelum rivers and the implementation of protective measures in areas susceptible to cloudbursts.\n\nEmergency service departments were instructed to remain on 24/7 alert.\n\nThe Health Department was specifically directed to ensure continuous availability of ambulances, doctors, and essential medicines in basic health units (BHUs), rural health centres (RHCs), and emergency wards.\n\nAdditionally, the meeting resolved to maintain an uninterrupted supply of medicines and wheat flour throughout the monsoon season, particularly to remote and hard-to-access regions.\n\n“Stockpiles of food and medicine must be secured in far-flung areas, and doctors posted in advance,” the prime minister said, adding that all departments must ensure unimpeded traffic flow and readiness for any weather-related disruptions.\n\nHighlighting the growing number of visitors to scenic AJK during the rainy season, Mr Haq also called for proactive safety arrangements for tourists, including advance warnings, monitoring, and rescue readiness.\n\nHe underscored the need for coordinated strategies among the Highways, Health, and SDMA departments and directed the Press Information Department (PID) to provide the public with timely, verified updates and guidance throughout the season.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
