  "content": "QUETTA: Musawir Kakar, the 14-year-old student who was abducted over seven months ago for ransom, was laid to rest on Saturday evening in Kasi graveyard, as thousands of mourners gathered to bid farewell.\n\nThe funeral prayers, held at Railway Hockey Ground, were attended by a large number of people from across the city.\n\nThe business community observed a complete shutter-down strike. All major shopping malls, markets remained closed throughout the day.\n\nThe funeral was attended by provincial ministers including Bakht Moham­mad Kakar, MPAs Haji Ali Madad Jat­tak and Malik Naeem Bazai, Inspector General of Police Moazzam Jah Ansari, and several political leaders. Among them were Asghar Khan Achakzai of the ANP, PkMAP secretary general Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, Dr Hamid Achakzai, Nasrullah Zerey of PkNAP, and Malik Naseer Shahwani of BNP.\n\nPolitical and social workers, along with citizens from all walks of life, joined in mourning the tragic loss. The city wore a somber look, with empty streets and closed businesses as thousands made their way to the funeral.\n\nMusawir, the son of a local trader, was kidnapped on Nov 15, 2024, while travelling to school in a van with other students. The kidnappers later demanded a ransom of $12 million for his release.\n\nBalochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti strongly condemned the killing, describing it as a barbaric act committed by ISIS-linked terrorists.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, the chief minister said Musawir was murdered in cold blood despite the provincial government’s continuous efforts over the past seven months to secure his safe return.\n\n“The father and uncle of the slain child are fully aware of the measures we undertook to bring him back safely,” CM Bugti said, emphasising the government’s commitment to the case.\n\nHe also said that state machinery is now fully engaged in action against those responsible. “Some of the terrorists involved have already been eliminated, and others are being actively pursued,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
