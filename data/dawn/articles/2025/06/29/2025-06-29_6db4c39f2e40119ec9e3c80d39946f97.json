He also mentioned the sisters of Mr Khan, claiming that they simply conveyed the message as they heard. “I have no doubt but every person can understand the message as per his/her understanding,” he said.\n\nDuring his conversation with Dawn, Mr Qaiser, without naming anyone, stated that some of the “friends of the PTI” were also responsible for the impression regarding rift within the party.\n\nThe former speaker said that they had decided that all the party leaders would hold a joint press conference in which they would give a clear message that “there is no rift within the party”.\n\nAnother senior leader, speaking on condition of anonymity, also endorsed Mr Qaiser’s view, stating that the major issue was that the leadership was not being allowed to meet Mr Khan.\n\n“The lack of communication has been triggering the confusion. Moreover, there can be differences of opinion within political parties and no one can stop it,” the PTI leader said.\n\nHe also dubbed the reports about internal rifts in the party as part of “a disinformation campaign”.\n\n“We have conducted an inquiry and reached a conclusion that there are five persons who have been running at least 25 social media accounts which are being used to create a negative impression about the PTI,” he claimed.\n\nHe admitted that there was frustration among the leaders and workers due to the “ongoing state oppression” and crackdown on the party for the last three years as well as the possible convictions of some party members and activists in the May 9 and Nov 26 cases.\n\n‘Establishment-backed elements’\n\nPTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said some of the “establishment-backed elements” were taking advantage of the situation caused by miscommunication within the party.\n\n“There are some paid people who have been criticising the party. However, we have decided to address the communication gap,” said Mr Akram.\n\n“We have decided to hold physical meetings, instead of Zoom [virtual]meetings, to avoid chances of wrong interpretations,” he said.\n\nMr Akram termed the consensus over the leadership of Mr Khan a “positive sign”, stating that everyone in the party knew that “they cannot survive without the founding chairman”.\n\nHe emphasised that the party was united behind Mr Khan’s leadership and acknowledged that rifts within parties were normal.\n\n“Rifts within parties are quite normal, as I have heard old PPP and new PPP, Zardari group and Bilawal group, Hamza group and Maryam group, and the rift between Shehbaz Sharif and Nawaz Sharif,” he said in an effort to downplay the situation being faced by his party.\n\nFawad Chaudhry, former information minister in the PTI government, attributes the issues to the party’s lack of experienced leadership.\n\n“Those taking decisions have limited experience, and the grouping in KP started in 2011,” he said, suggesting the formation of a committee to meet opposition parties and launch a movement to secure Mr Khan’s release.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 29th, 2025",
