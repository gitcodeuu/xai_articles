The police also seized the construction material brought by lawyers.\n\nA district administration spokesperson told Dawn that a case against the lawyers and their accomplices has been registered on the complaint of Ehsan Elahi Sabri, the reader of Burewala Additional Session Judge (ASJ) Sajjad Afzal.\n\nIn his complaint, the reader alleged that some 250 lawyers and private persons carrying firearms illegally demolished the house No 5 in the Old Judicial Colony, Burewala.\n\nHe stated that the attackers burnt the north boundary wall of the house after sprinkling petrol and resorted to indiscriminate aerial firing, adding that they also threatened him of dire consequences and fled away when the police arrived.\n\nThe spokesperson stated that the Vehari district and sessions judge and Burewala additional sessions judge were contacted to prevent the lawyers from illegally occupying the state land and the official residence, but of no avail.\n\nHe said that the state land was never allotted to lawyers for the construction of their chambers.\n\nHe said the lawyers “illegally attempted” to possess the state land and challenged the state’s writ, seeking action against “violators of law”.\n\nThe spokesman added that earlier the lawyers had also attempted to illegally possess a piece of state land reserved for a vocational training institute but the bid was foiled and to protect the institute land, walls were constructed around it.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 2nd, 2025",
