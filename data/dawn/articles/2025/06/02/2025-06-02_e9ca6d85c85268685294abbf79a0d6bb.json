These countries would have economic relationships, he said.\n\nRegarding the recent interim Afghan government’s directives to affiliates of the Islamic Emirate, warning them not to fight outside Afghanistan, he said it was the JUI-F’s stance from the day one that that there was no room for armed struggle to achieve religious goals.\n\nHe said religious scholars from both sides of the border had already given their Fatwa (decree) against armed struggle. In this connection, he said his party wanted everyone to follow the edict in both countries.\n\n“Both neighbouring countries are also upgrading their embassies as the position of the chargé d’affaires were up graded to the level of ambassadors,” he remarked.\n\nKeeping in view the growing economic impact of the China over the world, the Maulana said that the JUI-F would suggest Pakistan join the Asiatic federation to make it more powerful, instead of looking towards the West.\n\nRegarding the recent clashes between Pakistan and India, he said praised the armed forces for defending the country but said it was believed that both countries would solve their outstanding issues peacefully and would utilise all their resources for ending poverty.\n\nDenouncing the recently enacted law criminalising the child marriages in Islamabad, he announced launch of a protest movement with its first public meeting in Hazara division on June 29.\n\nHe came down hard on the federal government for approving the Islamabad Capital Territory Child Marriage Rest­raint Act, 2025, terming it against the Constitution and the spirit of Islam. He said people would be informed about the effects of legislation in the JUI-F protest campaign. He said that the Islamic identity of Pakistan was being tarnished to please the West.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 2nd, 2025",
