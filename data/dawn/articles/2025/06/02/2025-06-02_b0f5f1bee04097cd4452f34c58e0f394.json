  "content": "SUKKUR: The Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) has urged the establishment of rem­and homes, women and children police stations and shelter homes for senior citizens in Sukkur to help pave the way for a more inclusive and supportive society.\n\nSHRC chairperson Iqbal Ahmed Detho said at a training session on capacity building of police officers in human rights education organised by his organisation here on Saturday that remand and shelter homes were important as police had to play a crucial role in safeguarding the rights of marginalised communities, including women, children, minorities and transgender.\n\nSyed Kumail Hyder Shah, chairman of District Council Sukkur, assured of establishing the remand and shelter homes for senior citizens and committed to providing necessary support for the establishment of police stations for women and children.\n\nSSP Shahla Qureshi emphasised integrating gender protections, coordination with anti-gender-based violence services, and proactive roles by police in facilitating survivors’ access to support services without procedural delays.\n\nShe emphasised the role of Anti-Rape Crisis Cells and Gender Desks in assisting women workers beyond legal formalities and encouraged greater coordination between police, SHRC, and civil society organisations for survivor-centred responses.\n\nSSP Azhar Mughal urged the participants to make a positive impact by ensuring proper implementation of laws and adhering to legal protocols.\n\nBarrister Aashir Masood Mahar led the comprehensive training sessions on key areas of law, including juvenile justice system, domestic violence, child marriage, human trafficking, and sexual offences, emphasising the importance of police officers’ knowledge in effectively upholding these laws.\n\nThe session concluded with distribution of certificates among the participants.\n\nEarlier on 30 May, a consultation meeting on the registration of women home-based workers under the Sindh Home-Based Workers Act, 2018, was held at the SHRC’s regional office here.\n\nThe event organised by Bhittai Social Watch & Advocacy brought together labour rights experts, civil society organisations, home-based women workers, and government officials to assess progress and challenges in implementing the Act.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 2nd, 2025",
