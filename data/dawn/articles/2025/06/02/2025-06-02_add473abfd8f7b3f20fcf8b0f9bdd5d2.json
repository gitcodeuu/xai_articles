They are killing us,” she said, as Palestinian men gathered for funeral prayers.\n\nThe Red Crescent also reported that 14 more Palestinians were injured on Sunday by Israeli fire near a separate site in central Gaza.\n\nCeasefire talks falter\n\nMeanwhile, Israel and Hamas traded blame for the faltering of a new Arab and US mediation bid to secure a temporary ceasefire and the release of Israeli prisoners held in Gaza by Hamas, in exchange for Palestinians in Israeli jails.\n\nHamas said on Saturday it was seeking amendments to a US-backed ceasefire proposal, but President Donald Trump’s envoy Steve Witkoff rejected the group’s response as “totally unacceptable.”\n\nOn Sunday, dozens of Pales­tinians marched at the funeral of a Gaza doctor, Hamdi Al-Najjar, who was critically injured late in May in an air strike that killed all but one of his 10 children.\n\nNajjar died late on Saturday.\n\n“We could die any time, but we are still staying in our land, remaining to work to do our duty towards our people,” said Mohammed Zaqout, director of Gaza hospitals.\n\nThe Israeli military has confirmed it conducted an air strike on Khan Younis that day, but said it was targeting suspects in a structure that was close to Israeli soldiers.\n\nThe military is looking into claims that “uninvolved civilians” were killed, it said, adding that the military had evacuated civilians from the area before the operation began.\n\nIsrael began its offensive in Gaza in response to the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, according to Israeli tallies, and saw 251 taken as prisoners into Gaza.\n\nIsrael’s campaign has devastated much of Gaza, killing over 54,000 Palestinians and destroying most buildings.\n\nMuch of the population now lives in shelters in makeshift camps.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 2nd, 2025",
