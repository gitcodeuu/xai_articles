But for the US, the removal of nuclear-related sanctions should be done in phases.\n\nDozens of Iranian institutions vital to Iran’s economy, including its central bank and national oil company, have been sanctioned since 2018 for, according to Washington, “supporting terrorism or weapons proliferation”.\n\nTrump’s revival of a “maximum pressure” campaign against Tehran since his return to the White House in January has included tightened sanctions and threats to bomb Iran if current negotiations yield no deal.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump in 2018 ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with six powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled Iran’s economy. In return, Tehran has rapidly violated the 2015 nuclear pact’s curbs on its nuclear programme.\n\nThe 2015 deal required Iran to take steps to restrict its nuclear program in return for relief from US, EU and UN economic sanctions.\n\nThe diplomat said the assessment of “Iran’s nuclear negotiations committee”, under the supervision of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was that the US proposal is “completely one-sided” and cannot serve Tehran’s interests.\n\nTherefore, the diplomat said, Tehran considers this proposal a “non-starter” and believes it unilaterally attempts to impose a “bad deal” on Iran through excessive demands.\n\nTwo Iranian officials told Reuters last week that Iran may pause uranium enrichment if the US releases frozen Iranian funds and recognises Tehran’s right to refine uranium for civilian use under a “political deal” that could lead to a broader nuclear accord.",
