  "content": "HYDERABAD: Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan’s emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman has said that neither the Pakistan Peoples Party nor the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz or the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf openly condemns Israel and the US, and urged the parties to come clean on the Gaza genocide.\n\nPakistan’s civil and military leadership should coordinate with Muslim and like-minded countries’ heads and their military chiefs and jointly push forthe resolution of the Palestinian issue because the moment they took such an initiative, Israel would enforce the ceasefire in Gaza, he believed.\n\nHe was addressing “India Israel murdabad” public meeting at Kohinoor Chowk here on Sunday evening.\n\nHe advised Pakistani prime minister to convene a meeting of Muslim countries’ leaders and their armed forces’ chiefs. The US was deceiving everyone and was in fact continuously patronising Israel, while the UN remained silent on the ongoing genocide in Gaza, he said.\n\nHe said that UN was witnessing silently the bloodshed in occupied Kashmir for 78 years but was not implementing its own resolutions over Kashmir. Pakistan should speak to Turkiye and coordinate with China as well over Palestine, he said, adding it was time for practical actions in addition to diplomatic efforts.\n\nHe said that a strong and clear viewpoint was needed over Israel and Palestine. “Why didn’t political parties including PPP and PML-N condemn the US. Both opposition and ruling parties had remained silent on the issue, he said.\n\nRehman regretted that almost all major political parties had remained silent over Israel-Palestine issue and they never condemned Israeli atrocities. PPP and PML-N should clarify whether they were with Israel or Palestine, they should come clean on this issue and openly condemn Israel, he said, adding that Israeli products must be boycotted and local ones promoted.\n\nHe said that the nation supported the Pakistan Army against India. JI had grievances against the prevailing system in which Sindh had to agitate over diversion of Indus River’s water and Balochistan’s people were protesting against the issue of missing persons.\n\nHe said that Nawaz Sharif had not uttered even a single word on recent Pakistan-India conflict and recalled how Sharif had made light of the line dividing Pakistani and Indian Punjab.\n\n“Nawaz must remember it is not just a border but a line drawn with blood that was shed during struggle for independence. Pakistan was not created for him to establish his mills and run his multiple businesses,” he said.\n\nHe said that JI had announced observing Youm-e-Takbeer as Youm-e-Dr Qadeer but the government’s ministries insulted late Dr Qadeer, who had done great favour not only to Pakistan but to entire Muslim ummah by making the nuclear bomb.\n\nHe said that dacoits, both from kacha and pakka areas, were ruling Sindh. Only a change of system could put things on the right track, he said.\n\nJI Sindh emir Kashif Saeed, Hafiz Tahir Majeed and others also spoke.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 2nd, 2025",
