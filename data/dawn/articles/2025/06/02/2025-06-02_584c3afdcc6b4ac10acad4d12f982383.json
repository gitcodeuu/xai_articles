  "content": "Australia all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has retired from one-day internationals to focus on next year’s T20 World Cup, the country’s cricket board said on Monday.\n\nMaxwell took the decision to prioritise his preparation for the T20 World Cup, to be held in India and Sri Lanka, and his commitment to franchise leagues, Cricket Australia (CA) said in a statement.\n\n“I think back to right at the start I was picked ahead of my time and out of the blue. I was just proud just to be playing a couple of games for Australia. I thought I was just going to have that,” the two-time World Cup winner said in the statement.\n\n“Since then, I have been able to go through the up and downs of being dropped, being brought back, playing in a few World Cups and being a part of some great teams.”\n\nThe 36-year-old has played 149 ODIs for Australia, scoring 3,990 runs at a strike rate of 126.7 — second only to Andre Russell’s 130.22.\n\nMaxwell’s 201 not out from 128 balls while battling cramps in a 2023 World Cup match against Afghanistan is considered the greatest knock in this format.\n\nMaxwell, who played the last of his seven tests in 2017, told the Final Word Podcast that the toll of 50-overs cricket, especially after a leg injury he suffered in 2022, affected his fielding ability during the Champions Trophy earlier this year.\n\n“I felt like I was letting the team down a little bit with how (the) body was reacting to the conditions,” he said.\n\n“I had a good chat with (chairman of selectors) George Bailey and I asked him what his thoughts were going forward,” he told the Final Word Podcast.\n\n“We talked about the 2027 World Cup and I said to him ‘I dont think I am going to make that, its time to start planning for people in my position to have a crack at it and make the position their own’.”\n\nCA chief executive Todd Greenberg congratulated Maxwell for “one of the most exciting and influential one day international careers in the format’s history”.\n\n“Glenns ballistic batting has lit up the cricket world and been one of the cornerstones of Australias continued success in the 50 over game, including his heroic role in the 2023 World Cup triumph,” Greenberg said.\n\nSouth Africa’s Heinrich Klaasen on Monday announced his immediate retirement from international cricket, bringing an end to a distinguished seven-year career with the Proteas Men, the national cricket team said in a statement on X.\n\nThe 33-year-old announced on Monday that he would be stepping away from the white-ball formats, which follows his retirement from red-ball cricket in 2024.\n\nKlaasen made his ODI and T20I debuts in the summer of 2018, and went on to establish himself as one of the most destructive white-ball players of his generation.\n\n“He has played 60 ODIs and amassed over 2 000 runs at an average of just under 44 in the middle order,” Proteas Men said.\n\n“His power-hitting prowess was on full display during a blistering career-best 174 against Australia at his home ground, SuperSport Park, in 2023 — the second highest score ever recorded by a number five.\n\nRenowned for his dominance against spin, Klaasen also represented South Africa in 58 T20Is, striking at a rate of 141.84, Proteas Men said.\n\n“His ability to take on bowling attacks with calculated aggression made him a mainstay in South Africa’s limited-overs setup.”",
