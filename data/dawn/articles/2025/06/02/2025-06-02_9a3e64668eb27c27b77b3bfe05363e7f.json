He said he wanted to bring the matter to the notice of the chief election commissioner, saying it was not tolerable that alleged rigging took place during the by-election.\n\nProvincial Election Commissioner Sharifullah, in a statement, denied these allegations. He said the voting process continued in all 185 polling stations without any interruption till 5pm. He said that the election commission would review any complaint regarding irregularities if it was provided in a proper way.\n\nOn the other hand, PTI leader Usman Dar alleged that the PTI voters, supporters and polling agents were expelled from different polling stations by the police to favour the ruling party’s candidate. Responding to the PTI and PPP allegations, Punjab Infor­mation Minister Azma Bukhari said that the people of Punjab had expressed full confidence in Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz in the Sialkot by-poll held on Sunday.\n\nIn an apparent reference to the PPP, she said even the party that got 400 votes was complaining abo­ut rigging. In a jibe at the PTI, she said that those who use words like ‘deals and NRO as weapons’ were now seeking deals themselves.\n\nIn a presser in Islamabad, the PTI accused the Punjab government and police of interfering in the by-poll, claiming that its polling agents were expelled from the polling stations. The former ruling party also claimed to have “video evidence of the rigging”.\n\nPTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqqas Akram said that the by-election was rigged because the Punjab government was aware that it would not be able to win without manipulating the polling. He claimed that there were a large number of people in rallies and public meetings, due to which the Punjab government was sure that it stood no chance in the by-election.\n\n“To win the election, PTI polling agents were forcefully removed from the polling stations, and then ballot papers were stamped and polled. Workers of the PML-N were allowed to remain in the polling stations, while our polling agents were told to leave. We have video evidence of all that,” he claimed.\n\nSheikh Waqqas alleged that pol­ice officials were openly supporting the PML-N workers and threatening the PTI workers. He alleged that workers of PTI, who refused to leave, were beaten and thrown out of polling stations. He clai­med that the helpline of the Elect­ion Comm­ission of Pakistan had become inaccessible during the polling.\n\nIkram Junaidi in Islamabad also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 2nd, 2025",
