I know he shares them,” Warsaw pensioner Lila Chojecka, 60, told AFP as she came to cast her ballot for Nawrocki.\n\nTrzaskowski voters tend to back greater integration within the EU and an acceleration of social reforms.\n\nTrzaskowski supports introducing civil partnerships for same-sex couples and easing Poland’s near-total ban on abortion.\n\nMalgorzata Wojciechowska, a tour guide and teacher in her fifties, said Polish women “unfortunately do not have the same rights as our European friends”.\n\nAnna Materska-Sosnowska, a political scientist at the University of Warsaw, called the election “a real clash of civilisations”.\n\nNawrocki’s victory is likely to embolden the populist Law and Justice (PiS) party, which ruled Poland between 2015 and 2023.\n\nSome analysts have predicted it could lead to fresh parliamentary elections if political deadlock with the government persists.\n\nNawrocki’s campaign was overshadowed at times by controversies over the circumstances in which he bought an apartment from an elderly man and his football hooligan past.\n\nA former amateur boxer, Nawrocki also strongly denied media reports in the last days of the campaign that he had procured sex workers while working as a security guard at a hotel.\n\nHis opposition to Ukraine’s Nato membership also brought heavy criticism from Ukrainian officials.\n\nNawrocki used his last campaign hours on Friday to leave flowers at a monument to Poles killed by Ukrainian nationalists during World War II. “It was a genocide against the Polish people,” he said.\n\nPoland is an EU and Nato member and a fast-growing economy of 38 million people with a leading role in international diplomacy surrounding Ukraine.\n\nIt is also a key supply route for Western arms and aid going into Ukraine.",
