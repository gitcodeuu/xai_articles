Their focus will be on conveying Pakistan’s concerns about regional security and responding to what it calls India’s “escalatory moves”.\n\nThis outreach is part of a dual-track strategy involving both official and informal engagements.\n\nAnother formal delegation from Islamabad — expected to be led by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal — is also due soon for trade-related discussions with US officials.\n\nOn the Indian side, a parallel delegation led by Congress MP Shashi Tharoor is also due in Washington on June 3, while Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri concluded a three-day official visit this past week.\n\n“This is no longer just about border skirmishes,” a senior Pakistani diplomat said. “This is about shaping the international narrative to reflect ground realities.”\n\nIn Islamabad, there is growing concern that New Delhi has moved swiftly to frame the conflict in a way that revives scrutiny of Pakistan in multilateral bodies like the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the UN. Pakistan’s counteroffensive seeks to prevent what it sees as an Indian effort to turn the recent crisis into a long-term diplomatic liability for Islamabad.\n\n“This is a political campaign masquerading as financial oversight,” said one Pakistani official, referring to India’s push to revisit Pakistan’s FATF status. “We exited the grey list in 2022 after implementing a comprehensive reform programme. There is no technical basis for reopening that file.”\n\nFormer diplomats in the delegation stress that Pakistan’s approach centres on transparency, restraint and reform. “We responded with maturity when provoked. That’s the story we are telling here — with facts, not slogans,” said one member.\n\nSenator Sherry Rehman, who is also part of the visiting delegation, emphasised that Pakistan is advancing its own priorities while actively responding to Indian narratives.\n\n“We have our own agenda to advance, but yes, when Indian allegations are brought up, make no mistake — we will use forensic chapter and factual verse. Myth will not be allowed to become the message on Pakistan this time,” she said.\n\nDar-Lammy call\n\nSeparately, Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar and British Foreign Secretary David Lammy agreed to strengthen cooperation in multilateral forums, particularly at the United Nations Security Council.\n\nThe understanding came during a conversation between the two diplomats, following Lammy’s recent visit to Pakistan — his first official trip — during which he met senior officials amid heightened tensions with neighbouring India.\n\nThe two sides also agreed to remain in contact and meet again on the sidelines of high-level UN events scheduled in New York later this month.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 2nd, 2025",
