  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Ministry of Law and Justice has advised the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST) to resolve legal obstacles before proceeding with the appointment of the director general (DG) of the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA) — a post that has remained vacant for over two years due to recurring controversies.\n\nAccording to sources, the Prime Minister’s Office recently returned the summary regarding the DG’s appointment to the MoST, seeking further clarification and process completion. Ministry officials acknowledged that the PM Office had not been apprised of the ongoing court cases and legal complexities surrounding the appointment.\n\nFollowing internal deliberations, the ministry sought legal guidance. The Law Division subsequently advised that all pending court cases and objections be resolved before the summary is resubmitted for cabinet approval.\n\nCurrently, two court cases are underway concerning the appointment process, while one candidate has also filed a formal complaint against the shortlisting procedure. The complainant alleges that the top-ranked candidate does not fulfil the advertised qualifications and experience required for the highly technical MP-I Scale position.\n\nAkhtar Bugyo, presently serving as Director General of the Pakistan Halal Authority, has challenged the shortlisting of Zia Batool, asserting that she lacks both the necessary academic qualifications and technical experience for the PSQCA post as per the advertised criteria.\n\nHe also claimed that she did not participate in the previously held interviews for the same position.\n\nDespite several court orders and directives to fill the position in accordance with MP-I rules, the process has been repeatedly stalled due to efforts to appoint candidates lacking the necessary technical background.\n\nSources claimed that Ms Batool was placed at the top of the list despite her career being primarily in education management.\n\nShe previously served five years as chairperson of the Private Educational Institutions Regulatory Authority, over two years with the Punjab Higher Education Department, and nearly a decade at the Higher Education Commission.\n\nHowever, the role of PSQCA director general requires specialisation in technical fields such as standardisation, conformity assessment, product testing, labeling, quality assurance, and regulatory processes, especially those related to imports and exports.\n\nThe second shortlisted candidate also reportedly lacks the required expertise, having spent more than 15 years at Bahauddin Zakariya University focusing on academic quality assurance, plagiarism control, and thesis evaluation — areas unrelated to PSQCA’s regulatory mandate.\n\nIn contrast, the third candidate on the panel is said to possess direct experience with PSQCA operations and is considered by insiders as the only technically qualified nominee in the current shortlist, although there were other technically suitable candidates interviewed.\n\nThe selection process was overseen by Minister for Science and Technology Khalid Hussain Magsi, Secretary Sajid Baloch and other board members.\n\nThis is the third time the ministry has attempted to recommend a candidate perceived as controversial or underqualified. Previous attempts were rejected by both the Establishment Division and the federal cabinet.\n\nJust a few months ago, the federal cabinet had rejected a similar summary, citing non-compliance with the advertised eligibility criteria.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2025",
