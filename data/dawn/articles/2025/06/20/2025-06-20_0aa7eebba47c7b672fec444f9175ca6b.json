  "content": "KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) foreign exchange reser­ves increased by $46 million during the week ending June 13.\n\nAccording to data released on Thursday, the reserves now stand at $11.721 billion, still significantly short of the $14bn target set for June 30.\n\nThis leaves the central bank with a shortfall of $2.279bn and only 10 days remaining to bridge the gap.\n\nCentral bank set to miss $14bn target by 30th\n\nGiven the limited time, it appears unlikely that the State Bank will be able to meet its year-end target.\n\nThe country’s total foreign exchange reser­ves currently stand at $17bn, which includes $5.28bn held by commercial banks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2025",
