Another minor girl was injured in the accident.\n\nThe two minor girls were daughters of Khurram Karim, who was driving the 4x4 vehicle. He and several other family members survived in the accident.\n\nSharea Faisal SHO Faisal Gul Khawaja said that six family members were on their way from their home, situated in Scheme-33, towards Sharea Faisal when an apparently speeding dumper truck laden with gravel fell on their car near COD gate. The family members were stuck up in the vehicle.\n\nThe dumper truck and gravel were removed with the help of heavy machinery to take them out, the police officer said.\n\nHe said that Mr Khurram, his wife and mother escaped unhurt in the accident.\n\nHe said Mr Khurram, his mother and wife, along with two minor daughters and his sister-in-law, were on his way to receive his brother, Kashif Karim, at the airport on his return from Saudi Arabia after performing Haj.\n\nHe said that Khurram’s daughter, Ayesha, 5, and his sister-in-law Shaheena Mohammed Naeem were killed while another daughter, Anam, 3, was injured. They were taken to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre where doctors pronounced Shaheena and Ayesha dead on arrival.\n\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the deceased sustained crush injuries on their heads and other parts of the upper bodies.\n\nThe injured minor girl sustained serious injuries and was later referred to the Liaquat National Hospital for further treatment.\n\nSHO Khawaja said that the errant driver managed to escape from the spot. The police have impounded the heavy vehicle and registered an FIR under Sections 320, 337-G and 427 of Pakistan Penal Code against the driver on the complaint of Shaheena’s husband Mohammed Naeem Khan, who is a senior clerk in the DMC West at Orangi Town.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2025",
