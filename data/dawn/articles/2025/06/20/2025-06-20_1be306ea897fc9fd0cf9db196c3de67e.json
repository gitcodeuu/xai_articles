And instead of encouraging solar energy, the government in its shortsightedness has im­­posed tax on solar panel,” she said, adding: “We should not be punishing people for turning to solar energy. While the government boa­sts about its generation capacity, it is doing little to ensure that power actually reaches the people.”\n\nShe said the people of her Shaheed Benazirabad constituency were up to 15-hour loadshedding during this sweltering heat.\n\n“And now with these outrageous taxes on solar they have been denied even a chance to find relief through a clean, alternative and affordable energy,” she regretted.\n\n“Let me say this with conviction that women are not just a sector of economy, women are half the population. No economic plan can succeed if women remain excluded from opportunity, leadership and policy-making.”\n\n“Let this budget deliver meaningful steps for gender inclusive vow, not just token allocations, but real mechanisms for empowerment,” she said.\n\nThe opposition members belonging to the PTI staged a token walkout to register their protest over the absence of Finance Minister Muhmmad Aurangzeb during the budget debate.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2025",
