However, Chinese Taipei responded strongly, taking the third and fourth sets 25-21 and 25-16, pushing the match into a decisive fifth set.\n\nIn a dramatic and intense final set, Pakistan held their nerve and edged past Chinese Taipei with a score of 18-16, securing a memorable 3-2 victory.\n\nThe individual performances included Murad Khan, a key attacker who delivered under pressure throughout the match followed by Murad Jehan who showcased outstanding defensive skills and played a crucial role in the fifth set.\n\nMusawer Khan continued his consistent form, contributing in both attack and service while Usman Faryad Ali played a critical role in blocking and net play. Fahad Raza also provided excellent support in transition play and coordination.\n\nWith the win, Pakistan finished on top of the pool’s standings and will face the second-ranked team from Pool ‘A’; either Bahrain and Indonesia. The date for the quarter-final will be confirmed by the Pakistan Volleyball Federation shortly after final pool standings are confirmed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 20th, 2025",
