  "content": "LEICESTER: The Britain-based family of the lone survivor of the Air India crash were torn on Friday between joy at his miracle escape and grief at the loss of his brother.\n\n“We are happy Vishwash has been saved, but on the other hand we are just heartbroken about Ajay,” his cousin said outside the family home in Leicester.\n\nVishwash Kumar Ramesh, 40, is believed to be the only person to have survived the crash when Air India Flight 171 plummeted from the sky shortly after taking off from Ahmedabad.\n\nHis brother, Ajay Kumar Ramesh, was on the same flight, but is believed to have perished in the disaster.\n\nSince Thursday’s tragedy, the small Leicester street where Ramesh’s parents and younger brother lived has been flooded with visitors.\n\nRamesh lives not far away with his wife and son, his cousin Hiren Kantilal, 19, said.\n\nAjay also lived in the town, one of the oldest in England, and the two brothers ran a confectionary business together.\n\n“They are wonderful people, and heartful people. They are greatest men I have ever seen in my life, both of them,” said Kantilal.\n\nThe brothers were returning to the UK after spending a few weeks on holiday in India, and the family had been waiting to go and pick them up at Gatwick airport.\n\nShortly after the crash, they were shocked when Ramesh, who had reportedly been in seat 11A, called his father to say he was alive. Ajay was seated at the other end of the row.\n\n“Our plane has crashed,” Ramesh told his dad, according to his cousin.\n\n“He was bleeding all over him, in the face and everything, and he said: `I am just waiting for my brother and I don’t know how I get out of the plane’.\n\n“He said: ’Do not worry about me, try to find about Ajay Kumar ‘and he said: `I am totally fine’.”\n\nKantilal said his cousin had waited for about 10 to 15 minutes seeking his brother, and then was whisked away to hospital by the rescue services.\n\nImages which went viral on social media apparently showed Ramesh walking away from the wreckage of the 787-8 Boeing Dreamliner, and have been splashed across the front pages of British media along with a photo of him in his hospital bed.\n\nHis parents had also been desperately trying to contact his brother Ajay on Thursday. “The call was going through, but no one was answering the call,” Kantilal said.\n\nAt the family home, relatives were frantically scanning their phones to try to buy a flight to Ahmedabad.\n\nDowning Street said that the foreign ministry had been in touch with Ramesh to offer him consular assistance.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2025",
