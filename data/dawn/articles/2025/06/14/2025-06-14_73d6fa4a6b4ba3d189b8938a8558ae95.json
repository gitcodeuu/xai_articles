They were soon joined by members of the PTI-backed Sunni Ittehad Council, and the opposition collectively rejected the budget, accusing the provincial government of neglect and mismanagement.\n\nDespite the disruption, the chief minister continued with his address and completed the budget presentation as opposition members continued their protest in front of the podium.\n\nDuring his speech, however, the chief minister condemned the Israeli attack on Iran. Regarding the MQM-P’s insistence on debating the resolution before the budget, Mr Shah clarified that the session had been convened specifically for the budget and that the resolution could be taken up after a brief adjournment.\n\nFollowing the budget presentation, Mr Shah formally tabled the resolution, which was unanimously adopted by the house. The assembly session was then adjourned until Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2025",
