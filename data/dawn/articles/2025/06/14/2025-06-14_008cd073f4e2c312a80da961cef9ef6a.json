  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Pakis­t­an’s airspace remains open and is operating without disruptions, Pakistan Airports Authority (PAA) said on Friday, following Israel’s military attacks on Iran that have forced flight diversions across the region.\n\nThe PAA said international flights are transiting through its airspace as usual with no reported obstructions or delays.\n\nThe assurance came as media reports indicated that neighbouring Iran had closed its airspace and that wider closures in the Middle East were forcing airlines to reroute flights.\n\n“The increased volume of air traffic, both national and international, is being facilitated smoothly, without delay or restriction through a coordinated and professional approach,” the PAA said in a statement.\n\nThe authority added that it remains “fully committed to ensuring the continuity, safety, and security of all flight operations through effective airspace management and close coordination with relevant stakeholders”.\n\nAccording to NOTAM issued to pilots, Iranian airspace has been closed until further notice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2025",
