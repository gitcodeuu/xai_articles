It will be launched for investor solicitation in the calendar year of 2025.”\n\nMore buses for Karachi\n\nThe government also announced bringing in 500 more electric buses, exclusively for Karachi.\n\nSpeaking about the project, the CM said that 1,000 electric buses will be brought to the province “through a phased implementation plan”. He said that 500 electric buses are for Karachi, with their full integration expected to complete in financial year 2025-26.\n\nHe said that 100 new 12-meter electric buses have been ordered under an innovative rent-to-own model and the fleet will be operationalised by July.\n\nHe said the Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) network was also progressing, with Yellow Line nearing completion and work on Red Line has been completed by 50pc.\n\nAbout the local government system, the CM stated that in the out-going financial year the provincial government provided a grant of Rs148bn to local councils, includ-ing Rs26bn to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation alone “in order to enable it to meet its operational expenditures and address the development requirements of the largest metropolis of Pakistan”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2025",
