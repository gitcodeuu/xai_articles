  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A fire that broke out late on Friday night on the top floor of the Information Services Academy was brought under control early on Saturday, causing damage to the building but no casualties.\n\nAn electrical short circuit was the apparent cause of the blaze, which started in the four-storey building located at Zero Point in the capital’s G-7/1 sector. No staff were present at the time.\n\nMore than a dozen firefighters using five trucks contained the blaze in about half an hour.\n\nCrews initially faced cha­llenges as low water pressure prevented them from getting a water str­eam to the top floor, acc­ording to the initial report.\n\nThe fire was successfully controlled after a vehicle equipped with a deluge gun was brought to the scene.\n\nGuards at an adjacent office building reported the incident at 12:20am on Saturday.\n\nCrews began a cooling process on the top floor to prevent any potential re-ignition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2025",
