According to the police, the youth’s friends stuffed his body in the trunk of his car and torched it in the Hub area of Balochistan.\n\nIn Feb, police arrested Armaghan Qureshi, the prime suspect, for injuring officers while resisting his detention. His friend Sheraz aka Shavez Bukhari was remanded by an ATC.\n\nArmaghan was sent to prison in March after he refused to record his confessional statement while a magistrate observed that the suspect was not in stable condition to record his confession.",
