  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Both houses of parliament on Friday unanimously adopted resolutions condemning Israel’s military attack on Iran, declaring it a violation of international laws and UN conventions.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar tabled the resolution in the Senate while it was moved in the National Assembly by Syed Naveed Qamar, who heads the Pakistan-Iran parliamentary friendship group.\n\n“Today in the early hours, Israel in violation of the UN Charter and international law, has once again committed a war crime by attacking our neighbour and brotherly country, the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n“Israel attack is a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of the UN and all international norms. It has put peace and security in the region and beyond in grave danger. Over the years, Israel has been the source of countless deaths of Muslims around the world, particularly in Occupied Palestine”, the resolution passed by the Senate said.\n\nIt regretted that the world and Muslim Ummah were witnessing slaughter of children and civilians in Gaza for the last 2 years on an unimaginable scale. “The inaction of the Muslim world against this genocide is especially troubling as it has now led Israel to attack another sovereign Muslim state, Iran”, it said.\n\n“This house jointly and unequivocally condemns Israel and its heinous crimes against Muslim Ummah, especially against brotherly nations of Palestine and Iran.This house stands resolute with our Iranian brothers and sisters and supports their right to defend themselves against this aggression”, it said.\n\nThe National Assembly also strongly condemned the unjustified and illegitimate aggression by Israel against Iran, causing grave loss of lives and property to the Iranian people.\n\nThrough a unanimously adopted resolution, the House noted with utter disgust and dismay that the strikes carried in the dark hours of June 13 were not only a serious violation of the sovereignty and integrity of a United Nations member state but also clearly contravened the fundamental principles of international law and the United Nations Charter.\n\nThe National Assembly warned that such continued blatant acts of aggression by Israel have brought not only the Middle East but the entire world into serious danger, the consequence of which shall entirely rest on Israel. It was stressed that Iran had a right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.\n\nReiterating Pakistan’s complete solidarity with the government, parliament and the people of Iran, the house called upon the government to immediately call for a meeting of the UN Security Council and the OIC to discuss, condemn and bring an immediate halt to the aggression on Iran.\n\nFormer prime minister and PPP leader Raja Parvaiz Ashraf, speaking on the occasion, stressed that mere condemnations were not enough and noted that practical measures should be taken for the defence of the brother Muslim country.\n\nHe stressed that Pakistan should play a responsible role while extending every possible support to Iran in this difficult time. Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) Chairman Sahibzada Hamid Raza termed Israel a terrorist state.\n\nAt this, Speaker Ayaz Sadiq remarked, “We do not recognise Israel as a state”.\n\nFederal Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain said that Israel was a serious threat to world peace. “Pakistan condemns Israel’s aggression and we are standing with Iran,” he said. PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said that Israel’s attack on Iran was a tragic incident of history.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 14th, 2025",
