  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A critical leakage has been reported near distributaries 14 and 15 at Head Jumma of the Chashma Right Bank Canal (CRBC) in Dera Ismail Khan, raising fears of further deterioration during the upcoming monsoon season.\n\nThis leakage near the two distributaries, and the first super passing towards the Indus Highway, is causing substantial seepage. The existing kacha (unreinforced) canal banks in this area require a reinforced concrete lining and regular maintenance.\n\nSpecial Assistant to the Prime Minister Haroon Akhtar Khan convened a high-level meeting on Thursday to review the damage and directed immediate repair and reinforcement of the canal’s infrastructure.\n\nThe meeting discussed the issue of leakages observed at the two dis-tributaries, along with the fragile and unreinforced canal banks, which pose a high risk of further deterioration.\n\nRecognising the seriousness of the situation, Mr Khan directed all relevant departments to begin repair and construction work without delay to prevent further damage.\n\nTo ensure efficient monitoring and progress, a committee was formed comprising representatives from Wapda and officials from the ministries of national food security and industries, and the irrigation department of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The committee has been assigned the task of reporting on the progress of repair and rehabilitation work.\n\nThe CRBC is the sole source of irrigation water for the region, sustaining the livelihoods of a vast number of farmers who rely on agricultural output. Haroon Akhtar termed the issue as “grave”, noting that both farmers and industry — the backbone of the national economy — are being adversely impacted. He emphasised that the problem must be resolved on an urgent basis.\n\nHe stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has consistently prioritised the issues faced by farmers, and the Chashma Right Bank Canal is a crucial source of irrigation water for numerous agricultural communities.\n\nThe Chashma Right Bank Irrigation Project is located in Chashma, Mian­wali district. The right bank canal off-takes from Chashma Barrage on its right bank and extends southwards up to Taunsa Barrage on the Indus River. The Chashma right bank irrigation canal was constructed to cultivate an area of 606,000 acres, of which 240,000 acres are in Punjab and 366,000 acres in KP.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2025",
