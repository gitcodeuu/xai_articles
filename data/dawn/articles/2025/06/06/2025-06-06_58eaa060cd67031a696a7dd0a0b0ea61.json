  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Senator Irfan Siddiqui, a senior leader of the PML-N and Parliamentary Party leader in the Senate, has claimed that PTI no longer possesses the capability to launch any significant political movement as it has already lost its esteem.\n\nIn an interview with a private TV channel, Mr Siddiqui criticised Mr Khan’s leadership, pointing out contradictions in his strategies: “PTI claims it can mobilise millions for a revolution, yet now it seeks to exploit the platform of a woman like Mahrang Baloch for its anti-state agenda. It wouldn’t be surprising if tomorrow they collude with BLA.”\n\nResponding to PTI’s recent announcement of an agitation, Mr Siddiqui remarked: “Imran Khan couldn’t rally mass public support even at the peak of his popularity. Now that he’s in jail, he is absolutely unable to make any difference. With a wounded leg, Imran led a long march to block the appointment of Syed Asim Munir as Chief of Army Staff but miserably failed to gather public support.”\n\nThe PML-N leader dismissed rumours of any backchannel negotiations with PTI’s jailed founder, Imran Khan, stating, “No government or establishment official has met Imran Khan in jail, nor has any offer been made or proposal extended to him. All such claims are utterly baseless and only aim to mislead PTI supporters.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2025",
