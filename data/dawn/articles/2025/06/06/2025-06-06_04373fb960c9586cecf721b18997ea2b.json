  "content": "BERLIN: German Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said on Thursday that recognising a Palestinian state now would send “the wrong signal”, despite moves by other European countries in that direction.\n\nSpeaking at a Berlin press conference with his Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar, Wadephul stressed German support for a two-state solution but said “negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians must be concluded” first.\n\nSpain, Ireland and Norway a year ago recognised a Palestinian state and President Emmanuel Macron has said France could do so by June, leading Israel to accuse him of a “crusade against the Jewish state”.\n\nGermany, as it has sought to atone for the Holocaust, has long been one of Israel’s most steadfast supporters, but has recently sharpened its criticism of its ally over the Gaza conflict.\n\nBerlin renews ‘urgent request to allow humanitarian aid to Gaza’ as required by international law\n\nWadephul said “too little” aid was reaching civilians in the war-battered territory, where the United Nations warned last month that the entire population was at risk of famine.\n\nGermany’s top diplomat added that he had renewed to Saar his “urgent request to allow humanitarian aid to Gaza” as required by international law.\n\nHe stressed that Israel has a right to defend itself against Hamas and other enemies, and that “therefore Germany will of course continue to support Israel with arms deliveries, that was never in doubt”.\n\nLast week, Wadephul had said Germany was assessing “whether what is happening in Gaza is in line with international law” and that arms sales to Israel would be evaluated on this basis.\n\nThis brought criticism from some within Wadephul’s own CDU/CSU conservative alliance, who accused him of insufficient support for Israel.\n\n‘Difficult hours’\n\nWadephul also said he was “concerned about the extremely tense situation in the West Bank” and that Berlin rejects the creation of new Israeli settlements there.\n\n“This settlement policy in this form is contrary to international law, it literally blocks the possibility of a two-state solution,” said Wadephul.\n\nLast week Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz vowed to build a “Jewish Israeli state” in the occupied West Bank after the government announced the creation of 22 new settlements there.\n\nSaar, speaking earlier at Berlin’s Holocaust memorial, said that Israel is “surrounded by enemies seeking its elimination” and that “the only difference between Hamas and the Nazis was their capabilities”.\n\nHe said a Palestinian state would mean “the biggest prize is being offered to the murderers, establishing a new terrorist state in the heart of our homeland”.\n\nSaar charged that “only Hamas is responsible for the suffering on both sides” and said that “we need Germany’s support today in these difficult hours”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2025",
