He described the conviction as “highly controversial” and “even more unsafe” than the pre­­vious convictions faced by his client.\n\n“This is the third prosecution brought by NAB after Tosha­khana I and II,” said Barrister Safdar.\n\nHe alleged that the judgement against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi had been predicted by journalists in advance, referring to it as a “leaked judgement”. He also pointed out that the Supreme Court had passed adverse remarks against Account­ability Court Judge Nasir Javed Rana, who had issued the ruling.\n\nThe lawyer urged the court to ex­­pedite the matter, and high-lig­h­ted the public and legal efforts made to fix the hearing date.\n\nNAB Prosecutor Abdul Rafay told the court the federal government had appointed Amjad Pervaiz special prosecutor, but he was later made advocate general for Punjab. The appointment of a new special prosecutor was pending with the law ministry.\n\nHe noted that while NAB has already notified its prosecution team, special prosecutors are yet to be formally appointed.\n\nMr Rafay then asked the court for more time to prepare for the case, saying, “I’m not ready to arg­ue. We request at least four weeks.” The court, however, set the next hearing for June 11.\n\nLifeless cases\n\nPTI Chairman Barrister Gohar and Khyber Pakhtun­khwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur criticised the case proceedings, calling them politically motivated and devoid of substance.\n\nSpeaking to the media outside the court, Barrister Gohar said the prosecution continues to delay the proceedings by seeking adjournments and filing cases without merit. “There is no life in this case. It’s me­­rely an effort to drag one case after another to exhaust our leadership,” he said.\n\nCM Gandapur stated that cases against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi were baseless. “There is nothing in these cases. Once the judiciary is truly independent, all these cases will collapse.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2025",
