This move is expected to result in cost savings of Rs180 million in landfill transportation.”\n\nTo support the public in proper disposal practices, biodegradable bags are being distributed in various neighbourhoods, the statement noted.\n\n“Vehicles used in the operation will be colour-coded for clarity: red tarpaulins for animal waste and green tarpaulins for general rubbish. Moreover, an automated monitoring system will reject overloaded vehicles at landfill sites, ensuring compliance with waste limits,” it said.\n\nMonitoring will also be handled through a central management system (CMS), which tracks vehicle movements and ensures timely collection. “To facilitate public complaints and quick resolution, the 1128 helpline will operate 24/7, with trained staff available to convey issues to relevant officers,” the statement added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2025",
