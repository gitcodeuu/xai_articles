In the chaos that ensued, they sought help from the jail authorities, who themselves were attempting to reach a safe location.\n\nThe inmates further informed the court that they had exited the premises temporarily but returned once the situation normalised. They alleged that the jail police later falsely showed them arrested.\n\nThe court observed that these statements created ambiguity, casting doubt over the alleged offence.\n\nThe court directed the IO to submit a report under Section 173 of the criminal procedure code along with all relevant record and proper list of arrested UTPs and their role on or before July 1.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 6th, 2025",
