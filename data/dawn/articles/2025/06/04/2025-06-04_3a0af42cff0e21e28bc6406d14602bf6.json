All have been asked to respond within the due period or face ex-parte action,” read the notice.\n\nThe officials, who were put on notice, included former DG (health) Dr Shaukat Ali (BPS-20), current additional DG (health) Dr Siraj Mohammad (BS-19), former director (public health) Dr Irshad Ali Roghani (BPS-18), logistics officer Khurram Shehzad (BPS-17), drug inspector Ziaullah (BPS-17), account officer Fazl-i-Diyan (BPS-16), computer operator Zakaria (BPS-16), computer operator Ali Nawaz (BPS-16), office assistant Umar Khitab (BPS-16) and pharmacy technician Mohammad Islam (BPS-16).\n\nOfficials told Dawn that the action was taken after a high-level inquiry committee, formed by the provincial government, detected Rs1.9 billion corruption in the purchase of medicines for public sector hospitals in the financial year 2023-24 and recommended recovery of the amount from the relevant people.\n\nThey said in Sept this year, the government notified a committee, consisting of additional chief secretary, establishment and finance secretaries, and adviser to the chief minister on anti-corruption retired Brigadier Mohammad Musaddiq Abbasi, to probe the allegations of misappropriation of medicine funds during the last caretaker government.\n\nThe officials said the committee sent its report to the CM, recommending disciplinary action against those found guilty.\n\nThe inquiry report had revealed that the former DG placed orders with different firms for the supply of Rs4.44 billion medicines without seeking demands from hospitals, so medicines were unnecessarily procured. It noted that commonly, procurements took only after all hospitals furnished demanded lists.\n\nThe report said the Rs1.91 billion items were procured in violation of the government’s policy.\n\nIt added that the records showed that the drugs kept in the main store valued at around Rs800 million but the suppliers were paid Rs3.17 billion.\n\nThe report revealed that many of those irregularities were detected in an earlier fact-finding inquiry by the health department and its findings were sent to the chief secretary for action.\n\nThere followed the formation of another committee, which verified those findings, prompting the CM to issue separate show-cause notices to those officials.\n\nAll those officials, including the former DG, have denied corruption charges.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
