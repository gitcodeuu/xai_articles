She also claimed that the worst form of rigging was carried out during a recent Punjab Assembly by-election.\n\nShe claimed that whenever ‘they’ faced pressure, deals were offered to Imran Khan and every time they suggested him to keep his mouth shut for two years, not talk about CCTV footage and apologise for May 9.\n\nIn May last year, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Maj-Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had said that there was no doubt that the PTI was behind the May 9 riots and asked Mr Khan to tender a sincere and public apology, while shunning “politics of anarchy and hate”.\n\nShortly thereafter, Mr Khan claimed that the army owes an apology to him since he was “abducted” by the Rangers on May 9. He subsequently also offered to apologise for the events of May 9, provided the involvement of PTI supporters in the violent protests was proved through CCTV evidence.\n\nMeeting with donor\n\nTalking about Tanweer Ahmed’s meeting with her brother in Adiala Jail, she said the Pakistani-American was a donor of Shaukat Khanum hospital, and she knew him very well.\n\nHowever, she admitted that Mr Ahmed also had connections with the establishment, which is how he managed to meet Imran Khan. She also said that a message was conveyed to Imran Khan through him, asking the PTI leader to apologise for the events of May 9, adding that her brother had asked for video evidence.\n\nShe said that Mr Ahmed had only one meeting with the PTI founder, who subsequently refused to meet him again.\n\nAleema Khan was of the view that “they” [establishment] sent messengers whenever the pressure on them increased. She also claimed that she and her sisters were also present in the jail when Mr Ahmed met her brother.\n\nShe denied being the one who arranged the meeting between the two men, pointing out that at times even she was unable to meet Imran Khan, and there were several people who were not granted an audience despite court orders.\n\nAleema Khan also said that her brother viewed the 26th Constitutional Amendment and the May 9 incident as part of the ‘London Plan’ hatched against Imran Khan.\n\nWho is Tanweer Ahmed?\n\nThe Pakistani-American businessman owns a network of fast-food franchises across four US states, making him one of the largest franchise owners in the country.\n\nMr Ahmed also owns the Prairie View Cricket Complex, the largest cricket facility in Houston, Texas. He is also the owner of the Houston Hurricanes, a professional cricket franchise. His business interests extend to the logistics sector as well.\n\nLast year, he was awarded the Hilal-i-Imtiaz, one of Pakistan’s highest civilian honors, which he described as “an unparalleled honor and a testament” to his “unwavering dedication” to the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
