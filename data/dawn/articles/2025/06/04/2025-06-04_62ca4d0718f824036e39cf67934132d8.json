Areas like Malir’s greenery are gone, replaced by developments such as Bahria Town, DHA City, and Kathore,” she said.\n\nMs Salam said that for World Environment Day, she had been receiving invitations for plantation drives, but one thing needed to be understood that this was not the right season for planting saplings.\n\nResponding to a query as to how air quality monitoring could improve understanding of pollution in a city, that is home to 30 million people, Abid Omer, founder of the PAQI, said that measuring industrial, landfill, or other specific emissions is different from monitoring general air quality.\n\nHe stressed that monitoring stations are needed at a large scale to assess Karachi’s air quality accurately.\n\n“Monitoring is essential,” he said. “Otherwise, you may launch a green cover drive and plant billions of trees, but without proper measurement, you won’t know the actual impact or cost.” Citing an example, he said that in the 1990s, Mexico City was among the most polluted cities in North America, but authorities took initiatives such as changing traffic timings to reduce emissions. He added that it is important to assess the actual costs and outcomes of such measures.\n\nEnvironmental expert Nazish Shekha said that the current measurements being taken focus on individual pollutants such as sulphur dioxide and PM2.5, which provide only a general assessment of air quality. “What we need to understand is how this cocktail of pollutants interacts and reacts together,” she said.\n\nDr Meesha Tanveer, lecturer at the Dow University, said that PM2.5 is the most dangerous particulate matter as it can penetrate into the bloodstream, potentially causing respiratory diseases and infections, including persistent coughing and sinus issues.\n\nShe added that the report also mentioned that the concentration of PM2.5 has increased significantly beyond the standard levels.\n\nCriticising the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa), environmental expert Yasir Hussain said he had rejected the earlier proposal outlined in the Karachi Climate Action Plan.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the new proposal — in which he is also involved — would be an improvement over the previous one.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
