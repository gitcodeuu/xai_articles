  "content": "RAHIM YAR KHAN: A gang of Katcha area dacoits in a video claimed to have kidnapped three men from Sadiqabad tehsil and warned the district police against using drones to target them, threatening to kidnap more persons if the operation continued.\n\nIn the fresh video shared by a Katcha area gang, six dacoits armed with the latest weapons are shown, along with three hostages.\n\nThe video shows the dacoits beating the hostages with sticks and questioning them from where they were kidnapped. In response to their questions, two of the hostages say they belong to Sadiqabad and have been kidnapped from Ahmedpur Lama town, while the third one says he was kidnapped from Kaman Bhutta area near Jamaldin Wali.\n\nThe dacoits warn the RY Khan district police officer (DPO) and Bhong circle deputy superintendent of police (DSP) that they are playing in the hands of their subordinates.\n\nOne of the dacoits, who seems to be the ringleader, claims that they used to be “peaceful residents” of Katcha area, but police started targeting them with drones.\n\nHe asks the DPO that let them live peacefully, or they will “destroy police stations and checkpoints in the area”.\n\nThe dacoits also warn the area residents against cooperating with police.\n\nThey further say that they are in hiding only as a strategy for a short time.\n\nAnother gang member warns the police that if they are attacked with drones, they will kidnap more people and kill them and the police officials, besides damaging vehicles on Sukkur-Multan Motorway (M-5).\n\nThey also blame some police officials for pushing them to violence and kidnappings.\n\nEarlier, on May 31, the police had used drones to target criminals in Katcha Rajwani area, and injured many suspects.\n\nThe police, led by DPO Irfan Ali Samo, are conducting intelligence-based operations (IBOs) against the Katcha area criminals and on Saturday last destroyed some of their hideouts.\n\nThe district police and Elite Force commandos also used armoured vehicles, long-range weapons and modern technology in the IBOs. Using drone technology, they traced the gangs’ hideouts and movement and dropped explosives on the targets.\n\nMeanwhile, DPO Samo reiterated his resolve to continue the targeted operations against the Katcha area criminals.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
