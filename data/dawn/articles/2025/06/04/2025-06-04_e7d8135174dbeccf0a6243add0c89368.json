  "content": "KARACHI: A large number of women leaders and workers of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) gathered outside the Karachi Press Club (KPC) on Tuesday to stage a demonstration and to demand the immediate release of Bushra Bibi, the wife of party founder Imran Khan.\n\nThe protest attracted many women activists, several of whom were accompanied by their children. Carrying placards and chanting slogans, the demonstrators also demanded the release of other detained women leaders and activists of the party, including Dr Yasmin Rashid and Sanam Javed.\n\nThe protesters were led by PTI leaders Serina Khan, Ayesha Rasheed, Sam Khan, Fauzia Siddiqui and Fizza Zeeshan.\n\nAddressing the protesters, Serina Khan alleged that Bushra Bibi had been imprisoned in an attempt to pressurise Imran Khan. She also claimed that the former first lady was being subjected to inhumane treatment in prison.\n\n“Imran Khan is fighting for the rights of the people, and every conspiracy to sideline him has been rejected by the people of Pakistan through their votes and peaceful protests,” she said.\n\nSam Khan stated that no movement could be suppressed through oppression and tyranny, adding that the entire nation stood with Imran Khan. She warned that decisions made against the will of the people would only further harm the country.\n\nMs Siddiqui said the imprisonment of Bushra Bibi was an attempt to exert pressure on Imran Khan, yet their leader remained resolute in his struggle for national sovereignty.\n\n“Without political stability, there can be no economic progress. The ongoing division within the nation will persist unless stability is restored,” she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
