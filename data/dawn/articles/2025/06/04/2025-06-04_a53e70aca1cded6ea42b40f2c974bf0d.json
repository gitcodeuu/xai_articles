He also handed over a letter from Prime Minister Nawaz Sha­rif to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\nBoth sides reaffirm commitment to boost cooperation in energy, trade, counter-terrorism\n\nMr Fatemi briefed Mr Lavrov on the recent conflict with India and expressed concern over Indian moves to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty, according to the statement. He also highlighted the risks of escalation and underscored Pakistan’s commitment to peace and diplomacy.\n\nMr Lavrov expressed satisfaction with the progress in bilateral relations, the statement said, and noted key collaborative projects, including the $2.6 billion revival of Pakistan Steel Mills and initiatives under the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO).\n\nHe reaffirmed Russia’s readiness to expand cooperation, particularly in counter-terrorism and regional connectivity.\n\nOn India-Pakistan relations, Mr Lavrov reiterated Russia’s call for normalisation between the two nuclear-armed neighbours, saying improved ties would contribute to regional stability.\n\nBesides presenting the Pakistani perspective, the delegations are visiting abroad to emphasise Pakistan’s restrained posture and advocate for dialogue over confrontation.\n\nRussia adopted a neutral stance in the aftermath of the Pahalgam incident. While condemning the attack as “barbaric”, Moscow stopped short of endorsing India’s allegations against Pakistan.\n\nLavrov had offered Russian mediation during the tense phase between India and Pakistan. Moscow’s growing engagement with Islamabad — including defe­nce deals, energy cooperation and regular joint military exercises — reflects a strategic shift to diversify partnerships across the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
