  "content": "DADU: A wildfire which erupted on Monday evening near Shah Makan in western Dadu ravaged a big part of around 35 kilometre forest area of Kirthar mountain range.\n\nDadu Deputy Commissio­ner Syed Murtaza Ali Shah said that initial efforts to contain the fire were hampered by the rough landscape and strong winds.\n\nHowever, he added, the winds eventually lost velocity allowing the fire to die down naturally. “Smoke is still rising from some areas, but flames have subsided,” he said.\n\nThe DC said it was not possible to bring in fire tenders due to the mountainous terrain.\n\nHe said there were no casualties in the fire.\n\nResidents of nearby villages, including Karo Koat, said the fire began on Monday evening and swiftly engulfed bushes and small mountain trees, creating thick plumes of smoke.\n\nSince there was no motorable road in the mountainous terrain to reach the fire-hit area, aerial firefighting was the only option to control the blaze, the villagers said.\n\nShahoo Bozdar, a nomadic herder from the area, said wild animals were seen fleeing the affected area to safety.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
