In total, more than one million Afghans have left Pakistan.\n\nIslamabad has labelled Afghans “terrorists and criminals”, but analysts say the expulsions are designed to pressure Afghanistan’s Taliban authorities to control militancy in the border regions.\n\nLast year, Pakistan recorded the highest number of deaths from attacks in a decade.\n\nPakistan’s security forces are under enormous pressure along the border with Afghanistan, confronting rising attacks by terrorists in Balochistan and the banned militant Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and its affiliates in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe government frequently accuses Afghan nationals of taking part in attacks and blames Kabul for allowing militants to take refuge on its soil, a charge Taliban leaders deny.\n\nSome Pakistanis have grown weary of hosting a large Afghan population as security and economic woes deepen, and the deportation campaign has widespread support.\n\nPakistan is now threatening to lift the protection granted to the 1.3m Afghans holding refugee cards issued by the UN high commissioner for refugees at the end of June.",
