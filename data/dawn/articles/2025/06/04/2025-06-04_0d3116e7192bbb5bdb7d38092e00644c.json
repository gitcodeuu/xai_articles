Still, the challenge can be addressed if Pakistan’s policymakers show the political will to drastically slash the wasteful current expenditure and undertake reforms to boost tax revenues to create space for bigger development allocations.\n\nThat said, both the federation and provinces must ensure their development spending is efficient to achieve the maximum returns from limited resources.\n\nThe government must also stop liberally handing out development funds to keep the loyalties of lawmakers; instead, it should ensure that schemes once begun are completed within the given time frame in order to avoid cost overruns and corruption.\n\nOur annual infrastructure spending of 2-3pc of its GDP is one of the lowest in the region, and well below the requirement of 10pc. So a growing backlog demands not just a substantial increase in public development expenditures but also effective and efficient use of those funds.\n\nBeyond that, the authorities need to rope in investors to finance new projects by creating an ecosystem where banks and capital markets are willing to finance such ventures in the private sector.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
