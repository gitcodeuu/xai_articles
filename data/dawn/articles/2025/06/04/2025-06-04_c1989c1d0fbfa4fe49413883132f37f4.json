  "content": "KARACHI: Cricket Australia (CA) has agreed to send its team to Pakistan early next year for a white-ball series, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking during an online media interaction, CA chief executive Todd Greenburg said that Australia was keen to visit Pakistan for more tours and that discussions were ongoing with Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB).\n\nAccording to the ICC’s Future Tours Programme (FTP) for 2025–27, Australia are slated to tour Pakistan for three ODIs and three T20Is in February–March 2026.\n\n“We are trying to schedule a red-ball and white ball series in our program with Pakistan where the window is available,” PTI quoted Greenburg saying. “I think the tour early next year will be a success for both boards,\n\nGreenburg said, based on their experience of visiting Pakistan in 2022 and then for the Champions Trophy, they wanted more exchanges where possible.\n\n“We went to Pakistan in 2022 after a long time, and it was a good experience for our team, hospitality and security-wise,” he said, adding that even in the Big Bash League, it would be a boost if leading Pakistan players could be available when it is held this year.\n\n“Teams in the Big Bash want more quality overseas players in the competition and if some leading Pakistani players are available I am sure they will be sought after.”\n\nIn 2022, Australia toured Pakistan for a Test and white-ball series after nearly 24 years.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
