  "content": "THE HAGUE: Far-right leader Geert Wild­ers brought down the Dutch government on Tuesday by pulling out of a shaky coalition in a row over immigration, sparking a political crisis and likely heralding fresh elections.\n\nThe withdrawal came just weeks before a Nato summit in the Netherlands, and ushered in a period of uncertainty for the European Union’s fifth-largest economy and major exporter.\n\nAfter a stormy last-ditch meeting aimed at salvaging the four-party coalition, Wilders emerged to say he had no choice but to pull his ministers out of the cabinet. “I signed up for the strictest asylum policy, not for the downfall of the Netherlands,” said Wilders, 61, whose far-right Freedom Party (PVV) handily won elections in November 2023.\n\nPrime Minister Dick Schoof described the decision as “unnecessary and irresponsible” and said he would offer the resignation of the PVV ministers to King Willem-Alexander.\n\n“I will continue as a caretaker… until a new cabinet is in place. Because life in the Netherlands and abroad does go on,” he told reporters.\n\nWilders had agreed with coalition partners to push through what he called the “strictest-ever immigration policy”, but he has since said the pace of its introduction had been too slow.\n\nEighteen months\n\nAfter that surprise election victory sent shockwaves through Europe, polls suggest his PVV is still the strongest party. However, the gap to his nearest rivals has narrowed, with the Green/Left party of former European Commission vice-president Frans Timmermans following close behind.\n\nThe liberal VVD party, a traditional powerhouse in Dutch politics, is also running near the top two, meaning any election would likely be closely fought. VVD leader Dilan Yesilgoz, visibly angry, described Wilders’ move as “super irresponsible”, adding she was afraid it would open the door to left-wing parties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 4th, 2025",
