This year, authorities have mobilised more than 40 government agencies and 250,000 officials, doubling their efforts against heat-related illness following the lethal heatwave of 2024 in Saudi Arabia that claimed the lives of 1,300 pilgrims.\n\nThe world’s largest gathering kicked off on Friday as Muslims from all over the world poured into Saudi Arabia. One of the five fundamental pillars of Islam, Haj is performed every year in Makkah with millions of pilgrims travelling to the holy land to partake in the ritual.\n\nHeader image: Muslim pilgrims pray at dawn on Saudi Arabia’s Mount Arafat, also known as Jabal al-Rahma or Mount of Mercy, during the climax of the Haj pilgrimage on June 5. — AFP",
