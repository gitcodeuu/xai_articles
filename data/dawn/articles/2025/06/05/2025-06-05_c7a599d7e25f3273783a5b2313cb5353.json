  "content": "ISLAMABAD: National snooker player Babar Masih on Wednesday urged the federal government and the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) to acknowledge his achievements on the international stage, lamenting the lack of recognition and support extended to him despite a series of medals won for Pakistan.\n\nAddressing a press conference at the residence of former federal minister and minority rights activist J. Salik, Babar said he had represented Pakistan in multiple international snooker events, securing medals on numerous occasions, yet had been overlooked for rewards and official recognition.\n\n“I fail to understand why I have not received the attention or prize money that is usually awarded to athletes who bring honour to the country,” he said, adding that he had recently defeated India’s Pankaj Advani, a decorated player in the sport.\n\n“I have a long list of medals but have never been given any government recognition or financial rew­ard,” Babar claimed. He app­ealed to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, adviser to the PM on political and public affairs Rana Sanaullah Khan, and PSB Director General Yasir Pirzada to address his concerns and acknowledge his contributions.\n\nBabar stated that he had been crowned Asian champion three times (in team events), and world champion once (also in a team event), and had bagged four gold, seven silver, and seven bronze medals over the course of his career.\n\n“While the Pakistan Billiards and Snooker Association (PBSA) supports official tours, promises are often not fulfilled, and private tours are completely ignored,” he said.\n\nWhen contacted by Dawn, an official of the PBSA confirmed that Babar had won medals in team events but noted that he had yet to claim a major individual international title. “Nonetheless, he deserves recognition for his achievements,” the official added.\n\nIn response to Babar’s remarks, DG PSB Yasir told Dawn that the Board’s policies regarding rewards for athletes are publicly available.\n\n“If Mr Masih’s accomplishments fall under the eligible categories, he is welcome to visit the PSB and present his case,” he said.\n\nSeparately, on Tuesday, PBSA chairman Alamgir A. Shaikh met Secretary of the Ministry of Inter-Provincial Coordination (IPC) Mohyuddin Ahmad Wani and Yasir.\n\nDuring the meeting, Alamgir requested the release of the federation’s annual and special grants. According to a PBSA press release, the IPC secretary assured him that the matter would be presented at the next PSB meeting for consideration and approval.\n\nAlamgir also discussed several long-standing issues faced by the federation with the PSB chief.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 5th, 2025",
