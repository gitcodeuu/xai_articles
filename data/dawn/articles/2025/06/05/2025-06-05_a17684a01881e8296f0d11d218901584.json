  "content": "PESHAWAR: The leader of opposition in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, Ibadullah Khan, has given reply to the legal notice served on him by Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur after he charged the provincial government of being involved in corruption, stating that it was his constitutional duty to hold the government accountable for its actions and performance.\n\nIn the reply, sent to the chief minister through lawyer Sultan Mohammad Khan, Mr Ibad denied that his accusations amounted to defamation. He said that chief minister should not act in an ‘intolerant and frivolous’ manner and should withdraw the notice unconditionally.\n\nThe said legal notice was served on Mr Ibad on May 24 after he addressed a press conference on May 16.\n\nIn the notice served through Advocate Ali Azim Afridi, the chief minister sought a proper apology from Mr Ibad with in a fortnight along with payment of damages to the tune of Rs1 billion.\n\nIbadullah Khan replies to legal notice of chief minister\n\nIn his reply, Mr Ibad stated that he in presence of other opposition MPAs expressed his honest opinion fairly in good faith, truthfully and in the public good and interest over a recent financial scandal surfaced in Kohistan district.\n\nHe said that as an elected member of the provincial assembly and as leader of opposition, it was his sacred constitutional duty to raise issues of public importance. He added that in a democratic system, which was governed by the Constitution, law and rules, it was the right and duty of opposition to criticise the performance, acts and policies of the government which it felt were unlawful and against public interest.\n\n“Similarly it is the duty of the government including the chief minister to accept largeheartedly, honest criticism from the opposition and correct and improve its performance. As a public figure entrusted with authority derived from the people under the law, the chief minister unlike a dictator or king should never feel vilified, injured, ridiculed, disliked or feel that his reputation, standing, stature or political standing has been injured when in a democratic system his government is criticised and asked to correct course,” the reply states.\n\nHe claimed that the press conference alluded to in the legal notice was held on an issue which was based on facts. He pointed out that Public Accounts Committee of KP Assembly and National Accountability Bureau (NAB) both had taken notice of the scandal and were probing it.\n\nHe contended that the press conference was held on the premises of provincial assembly and was thus also protected by parliamentary privilege under the law.\n\nMr Ibad said that the issue related to squandering of public funds raised from taxes imposed on the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and it was a serious and critical case relating to corruption in public funds.\n\nHe stated that reference to the chief minister in the press talk was to the extent to remind him of his responsibility to probe the issue and to ensure accountability of the involved persons.\n\n“The chief minister being the chief executive of the province is ultimately responsible for all governance in the province,” he stated.\n\nHe stated that instead of claiming without any basis that his (Mr Ibad) conduct was malicious, the chief minister should have taken the issue seriously and worked with opposition members to hold the responsible persons accountable.\n\nMr Ibad, who is a leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz, said that a political democratic personality, who was holding a responsible post, should never be afraid of honest criticism raised by opposition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 5th, 2025",
