It became a games juggernaut with titles, including two “The Legend of Zelda” titles and Covid-19 pandemic breakout hit “Animal Crossing: New Horizons”.\n\nThe Switch 2 bears many similarities with its predecessor but offers a larger screen and improved graphics, and debuts with titles including “Mario Kart World”.\n\n“The much larger audience of Switch users should translate to stronger adoption in the opening part of its lifecycle,” said Piers Harding-Rolls, an analyst at Ampere Analysis.\n\n“Nintendo is better prepared this time around” to deal with the high demand, he said.\n\nThe launch of the $499.99 Switch 2 is a test of Nintendo’s supply chain management during US President Donald Trump’s trade war.\n\nNintendo last month forecast sales of 15m Switch 2 units during the current financial year, as well as 4.5m Switch units.\n\nPresident Shuntaro Furukawa said Nintendo will strengthen production capacity to respond to strong demand and focus on sales promotion in an effort to exceed the forecast.\n\n“Given it’s a special occasion, I wanted to buy [the Switch 2] right away on its release date,” said Shinichi Sekiguchi, a hotel receptionist in his thirties.\n\nNintendo said it received 2.2m applications for its Switch 2 sales lottery on its My Nintendo Store in Japan. Pre-orders at Target sold out in less than two hours.\n\n“You are looking at weeks or months until you can walk into a store and buy a Switch 2,” said Toto of Kantan Games.\n\nInvestor expectations for the new device are similarly lofty. Nintendo’s shares, which closed down two per cent in Tokyo, have gained 28pc this year.\n\nConcerns include whether momentum for the Switch 2 will be sustained after hardcore gamers have upgraded.\n\n“The volume of first-party games on offer at launch isn’t as strong as it could be, so some more casual users may wait and see how the games available build over the next one to two years before making the leap,” said Ampere’s Harding-Rolls.\n\nAmpere forecasts Switch 2 sales to exceed 100m units in 2030.\n\n“Mario Kart World” has a US sticker price of $79.99, generating debate over the price of games. Nintendo is also attracting third-party titles to the system.\n\n“I’ve been around since the era of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System and games from [that period] were expensive too so I think it’s somewhat within the acceptable range,” said Akitomo Takahashi, a salesman in his forties.\n\nTakahashi said he was keen to play action role-playing game “Elden Ring” on his Switch 2.",
