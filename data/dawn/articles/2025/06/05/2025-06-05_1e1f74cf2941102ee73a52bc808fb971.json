  "content": "WAKO: Researchers in Japan have developed a plastic that dissolves in seawater within hours, offering up a potential solution for a modern-day scourge polluting oceans and harming wildlife.\n\nWhile scientists have long experimented with biodegradable plastics, researchers from the RIKEN Centre for Emergent Matter Science and the University of Tokyo say their new material breaks down much more quickly and leaves no residual trace.\n\nAt a lab in Wako city near Tokyo, the team demonstrated a small piece of plastic vanishing in a container of salt water after it was stirred up for about an hour.\n\nWhile the team has not yet detailed any plans for commercialisation, project lead Takuzo Aida said their research has attracted significant interest, including from those in the packaging sector.\n\nScientists worldwide are racing to develop innovative solutions to the growing plastic waste crisis, an effort championed by awareness campaigns such as World Environment Day taking place on June 5.\n\nPlastic pollution is set to triple by 2040, the UN Environment Programme has predicted, adding 23-37 million metric tons of waste into the world’s oceans each year.\n\n“Children cannot choose the planet they will live on. It is our duty as scientists to ensure that we leave them with best possible environment,” Aida said.\n\nAida said the new material is as strong as petroleum-based plastics but breaks down into its original components when exposed to salt.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 5th, 2025",
