With temperatures reaching 42°C, officials ushered people away if they spent too long in one place near the bouldered hill, which had fans spraying mist and cool air at its foot.\n\nLate on Thursday afternoon, pilgrims began making their way to Muzdalifah, halfway between Arafat and the sprawling tent city of Mina, where they will gather pebbles for Friday’s symbolic “stoning of the devil”.\n\nDespite the heat, they were generally delighted to be performing the Haj.\n\n“I don’t think about the sun or the temperature or anything like that,” said Ahmed, a 44-year-old from Egypt. “Because standing in Arafat is a great thing and a beautiful day, and as you can see, all the pilgrims” are doing it.\n\nAli, 33, from Pakistan, said he felt “blessed” to take part.\n\n“This is something that I used to see every year on the TV screen during Haj and I always thought: ‘I wish I could be here’,” he said.\n\nThrough tears of joy, Iman Abdel Khaleq said she had wanted to perform the Haj for 10 years and was overwhelmed with emotion as she arrived at Arafat.\n\n“It’s a big dream for me that I had almost given up hope of realising,” the Egyptian woman in her 50s told AFP from the foot of the mountain.\n\nSaudi officials said the heat-mitigation measures implemented this Haj had largely been successful in preventing a repeat of last year.\n\n“We are encountering a limited number of heat-related illnesses cases this year and this is evidence of the effectiveness of all the organisation measures as well as preventive measures,” said Mohammed Al-Abd Al-Aali, Saudi Arabia’s assistant minister of health.\n\nAlong with the anti-heat measures and thousands of extra personnel, Saudi Arabia is also using an arsenal of high-tech tools to help better manage crowds.\n\nMore than 15,000 cameras run through artificial intelligence software are monitoring the holy sites and walkways during an event that has a history of deadly stampedes.\n\nThis year, officials have also clamped down hard on unregistered pilgrims looking to sneak into Makkah, using raids, drone surveillance and a barrage of text alerts.\n\nLate on Thursday, a Haj ministry source said the moves had helped stave off overcrowding at the holy sites so far.\n\nHaj permits are allocated to countries on a quota basis and distributed to individuals by a lottery. But even for those who can obtain them, the steep costs prompt many to attempt Haj without a permit, even though they risk arrest and deportation if caught.\n\nSaudi Arabia earns billions of dollars a year from Haj and Umrah.",
