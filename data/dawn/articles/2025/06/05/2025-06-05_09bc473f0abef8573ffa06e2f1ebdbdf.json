On a month-on-month basis, exports increased 17.43pc.\n\nIn the 11 months of FY25, export proceeds rose 4.72pc to $29.445bn against $28.117bn in the corresponding period last year.\n\nGlobal buyers have redirected clothing sourcing from Bangladesh and China, placing orders with Pakistan over the past few months. It allows exporters to capitalise on the opportunity and capture the market.\n\nTrade deficit\n\nAccording to the PBS data, imports grew 7.30pc to $53.450bn in July-May FY25 from $49.815bn over the last year. Imports rose 5.23pc to $5.172bn in May from $4.915bn. Month-on-month, imports decreased 7.58pc.\n\nThe IMF revised its import forecast downward by $3.3bn from $60.5bn to $57.2bn for FY25, conver­ging with the governmen­­t’s projection of $57.3bn. In FY24, imports decrea­sed 0.84pc to $54.73bn com­­­pared to $55.19bn in FY23.\n\nThe trade deficit in July-May FY25 widened by 10.63pc to $24.005bn from $21.698bn over the last year. In May, the deficit increased by 26.16pc to $2.619bn from $2.076bn last year. The trade gap contracted to $24.08bn in FY24 from $27.47bn in the preceding year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 5th, 2025",
