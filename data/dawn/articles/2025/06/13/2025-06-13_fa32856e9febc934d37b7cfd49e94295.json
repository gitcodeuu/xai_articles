  "content": "Israel said early on Friday it had struck Iranian nuclear targets to block Tehran from developing atomic weapons, and Iranian media and witnesses reported explosions, including at the country’s main uranium enrichment facility.\n\nCalling it a “decisive moment in Israel’s history”, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was also targeting Iranian scientists working on a nuclear bomb and missile factories in an operation that would continue for days.\n\nIran has long maintained that its nuclear-related activity is for peaceful purposes.\n\nIsrael declared a state of emergency in anticipation of retaliatory missile and drone strikes by Tehran.\n\nHere are some reactions from top officials and governments around the world:\n\n“Tonight, Israel took unilateral action against Iran. We are not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces in the region.”\n\n“Let me be clear: Iran should not target US nterests or personnel.”\n\nPakistan strongly condemned the “unjustified and illegitimate aggression” by Israel and stood in solidarity with the people of Iran, according to a statement by the Foreign Office.\n\n“Pakistan stands in resolute solidarity with the people of Iran and unequivocally denounces these blatant provocations, which constitute a grave danger and a serious threat to the peace, security, and stability of the entire region and beyond, with serious implications,” the FO said.\n\n“The Israeli military strikes violate the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Islamic Republic of Iran and clearly contravene the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law. Iran has the right to self-defence under Article 51 of the UN Charter.”\n\nPakistan noted that the international community and the UN bear responsibility to “uphold international law, stop this aggression immediately and hold the aggressor accountable for its actions.”\n\nForeign Minister Ishaq Dar also noted that Israel’s attacks were a “brazen violation of Iran’s sovereignty.”\n\n“This abhorrent action has shaken foundations of international law as well as conscience of humanity, and gravely undermines regional stability & international security. Pakistan stands in solidarity with the government and the people of Iran,” he said in a statement on X.\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari also strongly condemned Israeli aggression against Iran, labelling the act as a “flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran,” the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\n“The Israeli military strikes are a flagrant violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iran, and amount to total disregard of the UN Charter and fundamental principles of international law”, the president said, according to a President House press release.\n\nExpressing sympathy at the loss of lives, he urged the international community and the UN to “hold the aggressor accountable, and take immediate action to prevent the situation from further escalation.”\n\nCondemning the attack, PPP Senator Sherry Rehman cautioned, “the start of a new war in the region could be very dangerous,” adding that the “world can not afford any wars.”\n\nShe urged world leaders to “make every possible effort to establish peace in the world.\n\n“The effects of war are not limited to only one country; it affects us all,” she said. “The goals of developing countries are badly affected during times of war.”\n\nIraq condemned Israel’s “military aggression” against Iran, saying that the wave of air strikes violated international law and threatened global security.\n\n“The Government of the Republic of Iraq strongly condemns the military aggression launched by the Zionist entity against the territory of the Islamic Republic of Iran,” it said in a statement.\n\n“This act represents a blatant violation of the fundamental principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations, and constitutes a serious threat to international peace and security.”\n\nRiyadh, once a rival of Tehran before reconciling about two years ago, condemned the wave of strikes that Israel said it launched against nuclear and military sites in Iran.\n\n“The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the blatant Israeli aggressions against the brotherly Islamic Republic of Iran, which undermine its sovereignty and security and constitute a clear violation of international laws and norms,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n“Oman considers this act a dangerous, reckless escalation, representing a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter, the principles of international law. Such aggressive, persistent behaviour is unacceptable and further destabilises the regional peace and security.”\n\n“The Sultanate of Oman holds Israel responsible for this escalation and its consequences, and calls upon the international community to adopt a firm and unequivocal stance to halt this dangerous course of action.”\n\nGaza mediator Qatar criticised a wave of Israeli strikes on Iran saying it “hinders” attempts “at de-escalation and reaching diplomatic solutions”.\n\nQatar “expresses its strong condemnation and denunciation of the Israeli attack,” the Gulf state’s foreign ministry said in a statement reported by the official Qatar News Agency, adding the “dangerous escalation threatens security and stability of the region and hinders efforts to de-escalate and reach diplomatic solutions”.\n\nTurkiye said Israel must “put an immediate end to its aggressive actions that could lead to further conflicts,” the foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\nEarlier, a top Turkish official condemned Israel’s strikes on Iran, describing them as “barbaric” and unjustifiable aggression, the Associated Press (AP) said.\n\nOmer Celik, the spokesman for Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s governing party also maintained that the action was a diversion tactic, aimed at shifting attention away from international criticism of its actions in Gaza.\n\n“There can be no legitimacy or justification for the Israeli attack. This is barbaric aggression,” Celik said on a X post.\n\nCelik went on to accuse Israel of “hostility” toward diplomatic efforts, noting that the attack took place amid ongoing negotiations between the US and Iran.\n\nErdogan warned that Israel was seeking to drag the world into “disaster” after strikes on Iran, urging the international community to stop what he called Israel’s “banditry”.\n\n“The international community must put an end to Israeli banditry that targets global and regional stability,” Erdogan said.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates condemned “in the strongest terms” Israeli strikes on Iran, urging diplomacy, AP reports.\n\nThe UAE is one of only a handful of Arab countries to recognize Israel, after it signed onto the Abraham Accords in 2020. The ministry of foreign affairs for the federation of seven sheikhdoms “stressed the importance of exercising the utmost self-restraint and judgment” and urged against the conflict’s expansion.\n\n“The Secretary-General condemns any military escalation in the Middle East. He is particularly concerned by Israeli attacks on nuclear installations in Iran while talks between Iran and the United States on the status of Iran’s nuclear programme are underway.\n\n“The Secretary-General asks both sides to show maximum restraint, avoiding at all costs a descent into deeper conflict, a situation that the region can hardly afford.”\n\nEU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas called for all sides to “exercise restraint,” extending support for “any diplomatic efforts towards de-escalation.”\n\n“The situation in the Middle East is dangerous. I urge all parties to exercise restraint and prevent further escalation. Diplomacy remains the best path forward, and I stand ready to support any diplomatic efforts toward de-escalation,” Kallas wrote on X.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer called on all parties to take a step back and de-escalate.\n\n“The reports of these strikes are concerning and we urge all parties to step back and reduce tensions urgently. Escalation serves no one in the region,” he said in a statement.\n\n“Stability in the Middle East must be the priority and we are engaging partners to de-escalate. Now is the time for restraint, calm and a return to diplomacy.”\n\nRussia condemned and expressed concern over what it called a “sharp escalation” between Israel and Iran, Russian state media reported.\n\n“Russia is concerned and condemns the sharp escalation of tensions,” spokesman Dmitry Peskov told state news agencies.\n\nThe Russian embassy in Tel Aviv also urged Russians in Israel to leave the country if they could and said it “strongly recommends” against travelling there until the “situation normalises.”\n\nIn a detailed statement drawn up at Putin’s behest, the Foreign Ministry condemned Israel and blamed the West for whipping up what it called anti-Iranian “hysteria”.\n\n“We strongly condemn the use of force by the state of Israel in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and international law,” the ministry said.\n\n“Unprovoked military strikes against a sovereign UN member state, its citizens, peaceful cities, and nuclear energy infrastructure are categorically unacceptable.\n\n“The international community cannot afford to be indifferent to such atrocities, which destroy peace and damage regional and international security,” it said.\n\nThe statement said Moscow believed there was no military solution when it came to allaying Western doubts and fears around Iran’s nuclear programme and that diplomacy was the only answer.\n\n“We call on the sides to exercise restraint in order to prevent a further escalation of tensions and the descent of the region into full-scale war,” the ministry said.\n\n“In this regard we recall the readiness of the United States to hold another round of talks [on Sunday] with Iran on the Iranian nuclear programme in Oman.”\n\nIndian Ministry of External Affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal urged both Israel and Iran “to avoid any escalatory steps,” saying India has “close and friendly” relations with the two nations, AP reported.\n\nIndia, he added, urges “dialogue and diplomacy” and is “closely monitoring the evolving situation, including reports related to attacks on nuclear sites.”\n\nHe said India “stands ready to extend all possible support.”\n\nChina said it was “deeply concerned” over Israeli strikes on Iran, condemning “violations” of the country’s sovereignty and offering to help ease tensions.\n\n“The Chinese side … is deeply worried about the severe consequences that such actions might bring,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said. “The Chinese side calls on relevant parties to take actions that promote regional peace and stability and to avoid further escalation of tensions.”\n\nGerman Chancellor Friedrich Merz has urged both Israel and Iran to avoid any “further escalation” in the aftermath of the attack.\n\nBoth sides should refrain from steps that could “destabilise the entire region,” said Merz, adding that he had been briefed by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu about the raids and had convened a meeting of Germany’s security cabinet.\n\nMerz emphasised that Berlin backed “Israel’s right to defend its existence and the security of its citizens”.\n\nGermany had for years been expressing concerns about Iran’s “advanced nuclear weapons programme”, he said.\n\n“Germany stands ready to use all diplomatic means at our disposal to influence the parties to the conflict. The goal must remain that Iran does not develop nuclear weapons,” Merz said.\n\nMerz also said that authorities would step up security at Jewish and Israeli sites in Germany following the Israeli strikes.\n\nFrance’s foreign minister urged restraint after Israel pounded Iran in a series of air raids.\n\n“We call on all sides to exercise restraint and avoid any escalation that could undermine regional stability,” Jean-Noel Barrot said on X.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said Israel had the right to protect itself and called for “maximum restraint” from all parties following Israel’s wave of strikes on Iran.\n\n“France reaffirms Israel’s right to defend itself and ensure its security,” Macron said in English on X.\n\n“To avoid jeopardising the stability of the entire region, I call on all parties to exercise maximum restraint and to de-escalate.”\n\nAfghanistan, condemning the Israeli strikes, said that “the attacks violated international law and fuelled regional insecurity.”\n\nThe strikes, which left key military commanders and nuclear scientists dead, “constitute a clear violation of the fundamental principles of international law, particularly national sovereignty”, Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid posted in a statement on X.\n\n“The continuation of such tension-provoking actions has made the situation in the region even more fragile and worrying,” he wrote.\n\nHe said the Taliban authorities, which do not recognise Israel, called for all stakeholders to “address this issue and prevent the spread of further insecurity and instability in the region”.\n\n“Australia is alarmed by the escalation between Israel and Iran. This risks further destabilising a region that is already volatile. We call on all parties to refrain from actions and rhetoric that will further exacerbate tensions.\n\n“We all understand the threat of Iran’s nuclear and ballistic missile program represents a threat to international peace and security, and we urge the parties to prioritise dialogue and diplomacy.”\n\n“It’s a really unwelcome development in the Middle East. The risk of miscalculation is high. That region does not need any more military action, and risk associated with that.”\n\n“Japan continues to make all necessary diplomatic efforts to prevent the further deterioration of the situation, while implementing every possible measure to ensure the protection of Japanese citizens.”",
