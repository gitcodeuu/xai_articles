  "content": "WASHINGTON: Pre­si­dent Donald Trump plans to inform trading partners of unilateral US tariff rates in the coming weeks, as a July deadline appro­aches for steeper levies to kick in on dozens of economies.\n\n“We’re going to be sending letters out in about a week and a half, two weeks, to countries telling them what the deal is,” Trump told reporters late Wednesday, at the Ken­nedy Centre in Washing­ton where he was attending a theatre performance.\n\nIn April, Trump imp­osed a blanket 10 percent tariff on most US trading partners and unveiled higher individual rates on dozens of economies inclu­ding India and the EU — although he swiftly pau­sed the elevated rates.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 13th, 2025",
