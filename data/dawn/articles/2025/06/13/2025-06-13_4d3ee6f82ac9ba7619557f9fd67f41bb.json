The test is likely to be held on the last Sunday of September or the first Sunday of October 2025. However, the final date will be announced in a couple of days in consultation with the admitting universities and with the approval of the council.\n\nThe PMDC is the national statutory organisation responsible for regulating the standards of medical and dental education throughout the country.\n\nThe new syllabus has five key subjects: Biology, Chemistry, Physics, English, and Logical Reasoning, with a focus on conceptual understanding and critical thinking.\n\nThe structure, weightage, and difficulty levels for the MDCAT 2025 exam have also been officially defined. The exam will consist of a total of 180 multiple-choice questions (MCQs), to be completed within a three-hour duration. The difficulty distribution of the questions will be 15pc easy, 70pc moderate, and 15pc difficult. The format of the exam will be entirely MCQ-based, and no negative marking will be applied.\n\nTo qualify for admission, candidates must achieve a minimum of 55pc marks for admission in medical colleges and 50pc marks for admission in dental colleges. These standards have been lined up to ensure a fair and comprehensive evaluation of each candidate’s knowledge and readiness for medical or dental education.\n\nPMDC President Prof Dr Rizwan Taj, in a statement said that the new syllabus for MDCAT 2025 was a step towards promoting transparency, fairness, and standardisation in medical and dental admissions.\n\nHe said that a few gaps were pointed out in the previous syllabus, which have been rectified and the PMDC has successfully addressed the issue and introduced the revised syllabus within just six months.\n\n“This updated curriculum has been compiled to balance foundational knowledge with analytical and reasoning skills, serving the evolving academic needs of our next generation of healthcare professionals.\n\nUpdated syllabus lays the foundation for a merit-based, unified national assessment. The PMDC is also developing a question bank with expert input,“ he said.\n\nDr Taj acknowledged past challenges and emphasised that the council has worked diligently to resolve these issues and ensure a fair testing system. The new syllabus was developed through extensive consultations with education experts, universities, and provincial authorities, aligning it with national academic standards and international best practices, he said.\n\nThe MDCAT Committee, along with its dedicated working groups, has also finalised a unified national curriculum for the MDCAT.\n\nA total of nine meetings were held by the committee and its working groups to develop and refine the curriculum.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 13th, 2025",
