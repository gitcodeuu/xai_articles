  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Lahore Qala­ndars, winners of the recently concluded HBL Pakistan Super League, have announced that their championship trophy will tour the United King­dom and United States to promote a positive image of Pakistan and generate international interest in the league.\n\nIn a press conference held in Islamabad on Thursday, Qalandars’ management joined hands with the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme to launch a nationwide cricket talent hunt. The initiative aims to discover emerging players from across the country, with trials set to begin in Quetta on June 26-27.\n\nChairman of the PM Youth Programme, Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan, Qalandars captain Shaheen Shah Afridi, CEO Atif Rana, and chairman Higher Education Commission Dr Mukhtar Ahmed shared details of the initiative.\n\nShaheen said Qalandars had been running their player development programme for over a decade and, with government support, the new phase would operate at an unprecedented scale. “We will hold trials in 25 cities. I urge the youth to take full advantage of this opportunity,” he said.\n\nMashhood praised Qaland­ars’ efforts in nurturing talent and said the franchise’s experience would now support the government’s broader sports development agenda.\n\nHe revealed plans to establish 11 sports academies nationwide and lay new AstroTurf pitches to revive hockey. He added that Rs100 million had been earmarked in the 2025–26 budget for Arshad Nadeem’s athletics academy at the Pakistan Sports Complex, with the project’s total cost estimated at Rs2.85 billion.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, CEO Atif highlighted Qalandars’ achievements, noting their three PSL titles in four years. He said the franchise remained committed despite challenges, including a drone attack in Rawalpindi and the banning of Qalandars’ social media accounts in India.\n\n“The PSL’s success speaks volumes. The trophy’s tour to the UK and US will help amplify Pakistan’s cricketing image globally,” he said, urging youth to participate actively in the trials.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 13th, 2025",
