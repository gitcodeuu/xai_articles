  "content": "KARACHI: Three more tremors — two of them within a gap of seven minutes — were felt in parts of the city on Thursday, raising the tally of low-intensity earthquakes in the city since June 1 to 38.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department’s (PMD) data showed that two tremors, measuring 2.6 and 1.7 on the Richter scale, were felt in parts of Malir with their epicentres located 8km and 5km southeast of the district. They both originated at a depth of 10km, with the first one recorded at 1:45am followed by another at 1:52am.\n\nThe third tremor of 2.7 magnitude was reported in the afternoon at 3:41pm. It had its epicentre 8km south of Malir and originated at a depth of 10km.\n\nSince June 1, the PMD has recorded 38 tremors, most of them in areas near Malir. The other areas include parts of Quaidabad, Gadap, DHA City, DHA and Korangi. Their intensity so far has ranged from 1.8 magnitude to 3.6 magnitude on the Richter scale.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Chief Meteorologist Ameer Haider stated that the seismic energy accumulated at the Landhi-Korangi fault line was being released in the form of low-intensity tremors.\n\n“The city has a history of this kind of seismic activity. Hopefully, it will gradually settle down,” he said, adding that Karachi was surrounded by five active and several non-active fault lines.\n\nThe PMD’s data showed that as many as 10 tremors followed by a dozen more were reported on two June 2 and June 3.\n\nAccording to experts, the fault lines passing along the areas of Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir have become active after several decades and causing minor earthquakes in areas close to them.\n\nThe experts have rejected public concern, stating that minor seismic activities “pre-empt high-intensity earthquakes” by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates and that the seismic activity will gradually settle down.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 13th, 2025",
