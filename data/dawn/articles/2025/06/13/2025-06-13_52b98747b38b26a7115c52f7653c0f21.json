  "content": "LONDON: Australia captain Pat Cummins starred with the ball and Alex Carey made valuable runs following a dramatic collapse as the holders retained the advantage in the World Test Championship (WTC) final against South Africa here at Lord’s on Thursday.\n\nFast bowler Cummins produced a sensational spell of four wickets for one run when South Africa were dismissed for 138 on the second day in reply to Aus­tralia’s first-innings total of 212.\n\nAustralia collapsed to 73-7 in their second innings, with Kagiso Rabada (3-44) and Lungi Ngidi (3-35) doing the bulk of the damage.\n\nBut Carey (43) and Mitchell Starc (16 not out) shared an eigh­th-wicket partnership of 61 bef­ore the wicket-keeper was lbw to Rabada shortly before the close.\n\nThe last over of the day saw Starc dropped on 14 when Marco Jansen shelled a routine catch off Wiaan Mulder.\n\nAt stumps Australia were 144-8, a potentially decisive lead of 218 runs.\n\nA remarkable 28 wickets fell in two days on a pitch which, while offering some assistance to the quicks, was by no means unplayable.\n\nNevertheless, a match scheduled for five days, could now finish before the end of the third.\n\nRabada, who had taken 5-51 in the first innings, tormented Australia again with two wickets in the 11th over.\n\nHe had Usman Khawaja caught behind for six and, two balls later, removed Cameron Green for a duck.\n\nGreen’s exit meant the number three had faced just five balls in the match for a total of four runs.\n\nWickets continued to tumble after tea.\n\nLeft-arm quick Jansen had Marnus Labuschagne, in his first Test as an opener, caught behind for 22.\n\nAnd Australia’s 44-3 became transformed 48-4 next over when Beau Webster, who top-scored in Australia’s first innings with 72, fell lbw to Ngidi.\n\nAustralia were reeling at 73-7 after Cummins was bowled off his pad by an excellent Ngidi yorker.\n\nBut Carey and Starc led a defiant response that kept their side on course to retain the title.\n\nEarlier, Cummins finished with figures of 6-28 as he reached 300 career Test wickets and secured a coveted place on the Lord’s honours board with a five-wicket haul.\n\nSouth Africa lost their last five wickets for 12 runs as Cummins ripped through the order.\n\nOnly South Africa captain Temba Bavuma (36) and David Bedingham (45) offered meaningful resistance during a fifth-wicket stand of 64.\n\nAfter lunch, Cummins struck four times in a mere 17 balls of devastating pace bowling.\n\nSouth Africa had resumed on Thursday at 43-4, battling to put enough runs on the board.\n\nBavuma, who faced 37 balls for his overnight three not out, changed gears with a lofted cover-drive for four off left-arm quick Starc for four before he pulled Cummins for six.\n\nCummins had his revenge, how­e­ver, when Bavuma’s checked drive was brilliantly caught at cover by a diving Labuschagne.\n\nHe then dismissed Kyle Verreynne lbw for 13 and, three balls later, held a simple return catch as Jansen fell for a duck.\n\nThe Australia skipper ended the innings with his 300th Test wicket, Rabada well caught low down at deep square leg by Beau Webster.\n\nCummins received a standing ovation as he led his side off the field.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nAUSTRALIA (1st Innings) 212 (B.
