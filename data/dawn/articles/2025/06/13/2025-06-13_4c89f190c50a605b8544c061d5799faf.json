This increase follows a significant drop in April, when the inflation was at a near six-decade low of 0.3pc.\n\nThe financial sector, after an increase in inflation, remained silent over the next policy rate. Most analysts believe that the interest rate will remain unchanged at 11 per cent.\n\nAfter the rise of CPI-based inflation in May, there appears to be no chance of a decline in interest rates.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 13th, 2025",
