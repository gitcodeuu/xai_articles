This constitutional commitment is central to our efforts to eradicate child labour.\n\nAccording to the federal minister, it is the collective responsibility to protect children from exploitation and ensure their rights to education, safety and dignity.\n\nThe government action alone is not enough, he said adding media, civil society, and faith leaders must continue to raise awareness and advocate for children`s rights.\n\nChild labour is both a cause and consequence of poverty, and tackling it is essential to building a just and equitable society.\n\nLet us work together to build a Pakistan and a world where no child is forced to work, and every child is free to learn, grow, and dream, he said.\n\nMoreover, aligned with Sustainable Development Goal, Pakistan remains dedicated to eliminating child labour in all its forms.\n\nThe Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety is addressing the root causes through Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and Pakistan Baitul Mal (PBM), he said.\n\nSimilarly, the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), through its Waseela-i-Taleem initiative, provides conditional cash transfers to help children from low income families stay in school, thus reducing their vulnerability to child labour. Pakistan Baitul Mal runs Child Labour Schools that offer free education, stipends, and support to working children and their families. These schools also provide rehabilitation and skills training to help children transition to better futures.\n\nOur broader social protection framework, including support for health, nutrition, and income generation serves to empower families and reduce reliance on child labour.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Minister for Human Rights Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar paid a visit to the Child Protection Institute (CPI) here on Thursday, reaffirming the government’s commitment to ending child labour and protecting vulnerable children across the country.\n\nThe minister spent time with children currently residing at the CPI, many of whom had endured severe human rights violations such as domestic abuse, forced and underage marriages, and exploitative labour.\n\nDuring the visit, he interacted warmly with the children, listened to their experiences, and distributed gifts as gestures of empathy and encouragement. The engagement aimed to offer the children a sense of comfort and dignity within a secure and nurturing environment, a statement issued by the Ministry said.\n\nSpeaking during a briefing at the institute, the Minister emphasized the urgent need to combat child labour, describing it as one of the most entrenched human rights issues facing Pakistan today.\n\n“Child labour robs children of their right to education, safety, and a dignified future,” he stated, pointing to poverty, social exclusion, and inadequate access to education and social protections as the root causes of the issue.\n\nSenator Tarar highlighted recent legislative progress, particularly the Employment of Children (Amendment) Act, which had expanded the list of hazardous occupations to include child domestic labour and raised the minimum working age to 14 in the Islamabad Capital Territory. While acknowledging the importance of legal reforms, he stressed the need for a holistic response that includes public awareness campaigns, parental support, corporate responsibility, and strengthened social protection mechanisms.\n\nHe also urged citizens to play an active role in reporting child abuse and exploitation through Helpline 1121, a dedicated service providing immediate assistance to children in distress.\n\nCalling for stronger coordination between federal and provincial authorities, the Minister emphasized that sustainable progress required united action across all levels of governance and society. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to upholding constitutional protections and international obligations, including those under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.\n\nConcluding his visit, Senator Tarar issued a call to action for all sectors, government bodies, civil society, private institutions, and local communities to work collaboratively to create a future where every child could grow up safe, educated, and empowered.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 13th, 2025",
