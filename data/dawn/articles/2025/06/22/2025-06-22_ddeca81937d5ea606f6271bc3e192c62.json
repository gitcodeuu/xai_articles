  "content": "LOS ANGELES: After night fell on the outskirts of Los Angeles on Thursday, around 50 people clanged metal pots and blasted air horns outside a hotel in a noisy bedtime protest targeting US immigration agents.\n\nThe “No Sleep For ICE” rally underscored growing anger at Immigration and Customs Enforce­ment (ICE), a once obscure agency that has become the focal point of President Donald Trump’s migrant crackdown.\n\n“They terrorise our community the entire day. Why do they get a good night’s sleep?” said Nathanael Landaverde, 23, who banged a dismantled frying pan at the protest.\n\nDramatic images have shown federal agents, often masked and sometimes armed with assault rifles, chasing down migrants and handcuffing them at courthouses, farms and on the streets.\n\nICE officials have also detained some US citizens for allegedly intervening in arrests, including a mayoral candidate in New York this week.\n\nProtesters rally outside LA hotel to disrupt immigration agents’ rest\n\nThe heavy-handed approach has sparked fear among immigrants and infuriated many Americans, particularly in liberal cities such as Los Angeles, where large-scale street protests erupted this month over ICE raids.\n\n“If they don’t sleep they’re not gonna do their job effectively. They’re gonna get less people,” added Landaverde, as passing vehicles honked in apparent support for the late-night rally.\n\nIt was not certain whether ICE agents were staying at the three-star hotel, but protest organisers claimed to have photo evidence.\n\nDozens of people danced to a deafening cacophony as they waved signs reading “No rest for ICE” and “ICE out of LA” towards the hotel, where some guests peered through the curtains.\n\nOne woman simply screamed into a megaphone. Another man wore earmuffs as he blasted distorted white noise through a speaker.\n\n“They’re ripping families apart, and it’s horrifying to watch in my community. They can’t sleep if they’re gonna do that here,” said Juliet Austin, 22, who was playing a small blue accordion.\n\n‘Secret police’\n\nTrump was elected to a second term in large part for his promise to deport thousands of migrants.\n\nBut alongside their aggressive tactics, critics have denounced federal immigration agents for wearing face masks to hide their identities — a highly unusual but legal practice in US law enforcement.\n\n“At what point will we as a nation find ourselves with a secret police?” Walter Olson, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute think tank, wrote last month.\n\n“For the Trump administration, turning masked raids into standard practice fits into a wider effort to dodge accountability for potentially illegal and unconstitutional actions,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 22nd, 2025",
