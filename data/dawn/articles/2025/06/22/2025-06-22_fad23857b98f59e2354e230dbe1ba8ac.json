He and other opposition members subsequently staged a walkout in protest.\n\nMr Zehri urged the chief minister to formally assure the assembly of restoring the project.\n\nChief Minister Sarfraz Bugti, while responding on the occasion, said that during budget preparation, a review of ongoing projects was conducted under a specific formula, and some projects were deferred.\n\nHe invited the opposition leader to discuss the matter further in his chamber and added that he would make a responsible statement after re-evaluating the issue.\n\nCM Bugti reiterated that the importance of the project is undisputed and assured the government would not neglect any public welfare initiative. He acknowledged the opposition’s right to protest and emphasised that the people of Khuzdar would not be wronged.\n\nFormer CM and National Party leader Dr Abdul Malik Baloch warned that removing the project from the budget would have serious consequences.\n\nPanel of Chairmen member Ali Madad Jattak sent treasury members to negotiate with the opposition members, who later ended their boycott and rejoined the session. Mr Jattak welcomed their return to the house.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 22nd, 2025",
