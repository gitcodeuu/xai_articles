  "content": "KARACHI: Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab has urged the federal government to ensure Karachi receives its due share of the Export Development Fund (EDF), highlighting what he described as persistent neglect of the country’s economic engine.\n\nEDF is an autonomous organisation that works under the ministry of commerce and uses the Export Development Surcharge to “address bottlenecks faced by the exporters and producers of export goods and services in Pakistan with a view to increase the performance of export sector”.\n\nAccording to information on its website, since its inception it has funded more than 300 projects including Expo Centre, effluent treatment plants, garment cities, cargo complex at Sialkot airport, etc.\n\nIn a letter addressed to Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan, who is also the chairman of the EDF Board, the mayor expressed concern over the “unjust allocation” of the fund despite the fact that Karachi was contributing approximately 55 per cent of the country’s total exports.\n\nHe stated that the EDF, originally set up to boost the country’s export infrastructure, had “failed to significantly support Karachi’s export sector”.\n\n“It is unfortunate that there has been no meaningful contribution from the EDF to support or enhance Karachi’s vital export capabilities,” he stated, adding: “Such neglect reinforces the perception that Karachi continues to be ignored by the federal government.”\n\nMayor Wahab called for full transparency on how the fund has been distributed across the country over the last decade and specifically questioned whether any EDF-backed projects have been planned or implemented in Karachi.\n\nThe mayor underlined that Karachi urgently needs increased investment in export-related infrastructure, logistics and services to meet the demands of its growing population and industrial base.\n\n“There can be no national economic stability without Karachi’s inclusion. Sidestepping the city in federal initiatives meant to promote exports is not only unfair — it’s detrimental to the country’s growth,” he warned.\n\nHe expressed the hope that the commerce minister would take corrective steps, ensuring Karachi receives the investment it rightfully deserves.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 22nd, 2025",
