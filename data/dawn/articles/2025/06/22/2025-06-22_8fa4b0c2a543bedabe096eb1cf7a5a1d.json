Pakistan Air Force Falcons also performed a fly past over the venue.\n\nDuring his address, the premier highlighted that the recent military conflict with India concluded with Pakistan’s decisive victory “within three to four days”.\n\n“India forgot that wars are not won with weapons alone, but with the spirit of the nation,” he said, adding that the defeat taught India a lesson it will never forget.\n\nPM Shehbaz hailed the post-conflict period as the “birth of a new Pakistan” and called COAS Munir a “son of the nation”, whose strategy led to a decisive military victory.\n\nThe prime minister also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.\n\nHe praised the leadership of COAS Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee Gen Sahir Shamshad, and PAF Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber for their coordinated and swift response to Indian aggression.\n\nThe military confrontation between India and Pakistan came in May as the former, without evidence, linked the Pahalgam attack to Islamabad, which strongly denied the allegations. On the night of May 6-7, New Delhi launched a series of air strikes on Pakistan, killing at least 40 civilians. Both sides then exchanged missiles, which stretched over the week, before a US-brokered ceasefire had both sides agree to stop the hostilities.\n\nDuring his address, the premier also paid homage to the pioneers of Pakistan’s atomic programme, especially ex-president Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, along with other politicians, scientists, and the armed forces, for making Pakistan the seventh atomic power of the world.\n\nHe also commended then-PM Nawaz Sharif, his brother and PML-N president, for resisting international pressure in 1998 and taking the brave decision to go ahead with the nuclear tests in Balochistan’s Chagai.\n\n“Our nuclear arsenal is not for aggression. It is only for defence purposes,” the prime minister stressed.\n\nThe premier also unveiled the digital model of the Marka-i-Haq Monument.\n\nIn another highlight of the event, PM Shehbaz invited all political parties to become part of ‘Misaq-i-Istehkam-i-Pakistan’, to lay the basis for the greater national interest.\n\nHe underscored the need for the pact so the whole world could see that “differences have their own place, but we are all one for the sake of our beloved Pakistan”.\n\nAdditional input from AFP",
