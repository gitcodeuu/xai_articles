  "content": "PESHAWAR: Adviser to the chief minister on information Barrister Mohammad Ali Saif has said that if any attempt was made to impose any kind of emergency in the province, ‘the so-called fake government’ at the centre will not last even a single day.\n\nHe emphasised that since the public voted for Imran Khan’s ideology, the approval of the budget is also conditional upon his consultation, according to a statement issued here on Saturday.\n\nBarrister Saif said that public would not tolerate any disrespect to their mandate under any circumstances. He made it clear that the authority to dissolve the provincial assembly lied solely with the chief minister.\n\nHe further stated that since the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa voted for Imran Khan’s ideology, all important decisions will be made only with his consultation.\n\nHe warned the federal government to refrain from using cheap tactics and to arrange a meeting with Imran Khan as soon as possible.\n\nSays budget approval only after consultation with Imran\n\nMr Saif accused the federal government of hatching plans to weaken the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government, which is tantamount to weakening Pakistan itself. He said the people are being punished for voting for Imran Khan, despite the fact that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is a vital part of the federation.\n\nHe warned that any conspiracy by the federal government against Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would lead to serious consequences.\n\nHe said that under the leadership of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, and according to Imran Khan’s vision, the development process in the province is progressing rapidly — something the federal government cannot digest. “That is why new conspiracies are being hatched every day.”\n\nHe said that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was the stronghold of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf and that the movement for Imran Khan’s release would also be led from here in full force.\n\nHe said that false cases were filed to imprison Imran Khan, but soon all these fabricated cases would be dismissed and Imran’s release would be ensured.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 22nd, 2025",
