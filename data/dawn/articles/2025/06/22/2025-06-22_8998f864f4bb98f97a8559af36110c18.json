Two more died in hospital, raising the death toll to 20,” Ahmed said.\n\nSixteen were wounded, with 10 of them nursing severe injuries in two hospitals in Maiduguri, he said.\n\nCrowded fish market\n\nThe dead were buried in a mass funeral on Saturday. Corpses wrapped in white cloths, some covered in bamboo mats, were laid out in rows on the ground on wooden biers ahead of the burial.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 22nd, 2025",
