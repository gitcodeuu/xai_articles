  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan hockey captain Ammad Butt has called the silver medal in the FIH Nations Cup — following a 6–2 loss to New Zealand in the June 21 final in Kuala Lumpur — a promising step forward for national hockey.\n\nThe tournament, held at the National Hockey Stadium, saw Pakistan reach their first major final in 11 years, a revival since their last appearance in the 2014 Champions Trophy final in Bhubaneswar.\n\n“It’s been 11 years since we played a final on the big stage,” Ammad said at Allama Iqbal International Airport on Sunday night, after returning from Malaysia. “While we would have preferred gold, this silver should not be viewed as defeat but as a milestone, signalling our potential. I hope the government and stakeholders now take notice.”\n\nAmmad expressed gratitude to his team-mates and support staff. “They showed a fighting spirit throughout,” he said, ackno­wledging the hard work of coaches and officials.\n\nHe also lamented the absence of any government representative to welcome the team upon arrival, calling it “disheartening.”\n\nHead coach and former Olympian Tahir Zaman echoed the captain’s sentiments. He noted that the team’s underexposure to international matches affected their performance and was a key factor in the 6–2 loss.\n\n“We played after a long gap, and the lack of international match experience was evident,” Tahir said.\n\n“Nevertheless, our players learned invaluable lessons, demonstrated better teamwork, and the team’s FIH ranking has improved.”\n\nTahir added that alleviating financial constraints, such as delays in daily allowances from the Pakistan Hockey Federation, is crucial for sustaining momentum and enabling players to focus on development.\n\n“The players deserve consistent support and opportunities if we are to revive Pakistan hockey’s past glories,” he stated.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
