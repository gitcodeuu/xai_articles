He also reviewed Levies performance in the area. Several key decisions were taken to strengthen law and order and improve operational readiness.\n\nDG Magsi inspected the attendance and performance of the personnel present at the station and ordered further disciplinary action against those found responsible for negligence. He called the terrorist attack an unforgivable offense against the writ of the state.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
