Please do not violate it!” he said in a Truth Social post.\n\nEarlier, a senior White House official said Trump had brokered a ceasefire deal in a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Israel had agreed so long as Iran did not launch further attacks.\n\n“On the assumption that everything works as it should, which it will, I would like to congratulate both Countries, Israel and Iran, on having the Stamina, Courage, and Intelligence to end, what should be called, ‘THE 12 DAY WAR’,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social site.\n\nAn Iranian official earlier confirmed that Tehran had agreed to a ceasefire, but the country’s foreign minister said there would be no cessation of hostilities unless Israel stopped its attacks.\n\nAbbas Araqchi said early on Tuesday that if Israel stopped its “illegal aggression” against the Iranian people no later than 4am Tehran time (5:30am PKT) on Tuesday, Iran had no intention of continuing its response afterwards.\n\n“The final decision on the cessation of our military operations will be made later,” Araqchi added in a post on X.\n\nTrump appeared to suggest that Israel and Iran would have some time to complete any missions that are underway, at which point the ceasefire would begin in a staged process.\n\nIran’s semi-official SNN news agency reported on Tuesday that Tehran fired its last round of missiles before the ceasefire came into effect.\n\nIsrael, joined by the United States on the weekend, has carried out attacks on Iran’s nuclear facilities, after alleging Tehran was getting close to obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\nIran denies ever having a nuclear weapons program but Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei has said that if it wanted to, world leaders “wouldn’t be able to stop us”.\n\nIsrael, which is not a party to the international Non-Proliferation Treaty, is the only country in the Middle East believed to have nuclear weapons. Israel does not deny or confirm that.\n\nQatar’s Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani secured Tehran’s agreement during a call with Iranian officials, an official briefed on the negotiations told Reuters on Tuesday.\n\nUS Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US special envoy Steve Witkoff were in direct and indirect contact with the Iranians, a White House official said.\n\nNeither Irans UN mission nor the Israeli embassy in Washington responded to separate requests for comment from Reuters.\n\nHours earlier, three Israeli officials had signaled Israel was looking to wrap up its campaign in Iran soon and had passed the message on to the United States.\n\nNetanyahu had told government ministers whose discussions ended early on Tuesday not to speak publicly, Israel’s Channel 12 television reported.\n\nMarkets reacted favourably to the news. S&P 500 futures rose 0.4 per cent late on Monday, suggesting traders expect the US stock market to open with gains on Tuesday.\n\nUS crude futures fell in early Asian trading hours on Tuesday to their lowest level in more than a week after Trump said a ceasefire had been agreed, relieving worries of supply disruption in the region.\n\nThere did not appear to be calm yet in the region.\n\nThe Israeli military issued two evacuation warnings in less than two hours to residents of areas in the Iranian capital Tehran, one late on Monday and one early on Tuesday.\n\nIsraeli Army radio reported early on Tuesday that alarms were activated in the southern Golan Heights area due to fears of hostile aircraft intrusion.\n\nEarlier on Monday, Trump said he would encourage Israel to proceed towards peace after dismissing Iran’s attack on an American air base that caused no injuries and thanking Tehran for the early notice of the strikes.\n\nHe said Iran fired 14 missiles at the US air base, calling it “a very weak response, which we expected, and have very effectively countered”.\n\nIran’s handling of the attack recalled earlier clashes with the United States and Israel, with Tehran seeking a balance between saving face with a military response but without provoking a cycle of escalation it can’t afford.\n\nIran’s attack came after US bombers dropped 30,000-pound bunker-buster bombs on Iranian underground nuclear facilities at the weekend, joining Israel’s air war.\n\nMuch of Tehran’s population of 10 million has fled after days of bombing.\n\nThe Trump administration maintains that its aim was solely to destroy Iran’s nuclear program, not to open a wider war.\n\n“Iran was very close to having a nuclear weapon,” Vice President JD Vance said in an interview on Fox News’ “Special Report with Bret Baier.”\n\n“Now Iran is incapable of building a nuclear weapon with the equipment they have because we destroyed it,” Vance said.\n\nTrump has cited intelligence reports that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon, without elaborating.\n\nHowever, US intelligence agencies said earlier this year they assessed that Iran was not building a nuclear weapon and a source with access to US intelligence reports told Reuters last week that that assessment hadn’t changed.\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Trump spoke of toppling the hardline clerical rulers who have been Washington’s principal foes in the Middle East since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution.\n\nIsrael, however, had made clear that its strikes on Evin prison — a jail for housing political prisoners — and other targets in Tehran were intended to hit the Iranian ruling apparatus broadly, and its ability to sustain power.",
