  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In a bid to stabilise soaring sugar prices and curb market volatility, the Sugar Advisory Board on Monday approved the import of 500,000 tonnes of the commodity, amid concerns over supply chain disruptions and alleged non-compliance by millers.\n\nThe decision was taken at a board meeting chaired by Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain, who announced that all formalities would be completed in the coming days, paving the way for imported sugar to enter the domestic market.\n\n“This is a proactive step to restore market stability and protect consumers from further inflationary pressure,” the minister said, adding that the government remains committed to ensuring the availability of essential commodities at affordable prices.\n\nThe meeting reviewed the current sugar supply situation and discussed strategies to safeguard consumers against undue price hikes. The minister acknowledged that disruptions in the supply chain and non-cooperation from certain sugar mill owners had fuelled recent price volatility, impacting not just household budgets but also driving up the cost of a wide range of food items.\n\nThe ministry plans to implement strict monitoring and enforcement measures in coordination with provincial governments to ensure transparent distribution, prevent hoarding, and curb profiteering.\n\nMr Tanveer also reiterated the government’s resolve to uphold food security and market discipline through structural reforms and timely interventions. “We will not allow any unjustified increase in sugar prices under any circumstances,” he asserted.\n\nLast week, the minister held detailed consultations with representatives of the Pakistan Sugar Dealers Association to assess sugar availability, monitor price trends, and coordinate future strategies. He emphasised the need for transparency from the sugar industry in terms of production, supply, and pricing, urging all stakeholders to cooperate in maintaining stability in the market.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
