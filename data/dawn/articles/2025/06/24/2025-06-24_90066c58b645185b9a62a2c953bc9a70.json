Treatment and facilities are being ensured for them.”\n\nRind said that an investigation was launched into the incident, stating, “Strict action will be taken against those responsible once the investigation is completed.”\n\nHe also said that all possible help and support will be provided to the affected families.\n\nSeparately, Adviser on Local Government Hamza Zehri also extended condolences to the bereaved families, directing authorities to provide facilities to the injured.\n\nHe said, “No one will be allowed to play with the lives and property of citizens. [The] Metropolitan Corporation should seize mini petrol pumps and installations established in densely populated areas of the city.”\n\n“Those responsible for the Western Bypass incident will be identified and punished,” he added.\n\nIn April, a bus driver was burnt alive and seven passengers were injured as their bus caught fire after hitting a mini-truck laden with pesticides at Gojra on the M-4 motorway near Nawan Lahore interchange.\n\nEarlier this year, a fatal collision between two cars near Dhabeji on the Karachi-Thatta section of the National Highway claimed four lives, among them a newly-wed man and his mother, and left six injured when the vehicles caught fire following the accident.",
