She added that the people of Iran had shown remarkable courage in the face of Israeli attacks.\n\n“I myself witnessed missiles in the air, which were defused by Iranian forces through their strong defence system,” said another student, Hadiqa Batool. She further said that after the attack on Iran, the Iranian government had closed medical and other educational institutions in Mashhad and other provinces to ensure the safety of students.\n\nMuhammad Kaman, 24, from Multan, said he had travelled to Mashhad with his family for Ziarat, but they were forced to return to Pakistan by road as all flights had been cancelled.\n\nAccording to border authorities, over 4,000 pilgrims and students have returned to Pakistan so far through the Gabad border crossing.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
