  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakis­tan’s textile and clothing exports declined by 1.75pc year-on-year in May, marking the second consecutive monthly contraction and pushing overall sector growth into single digits for the ongoing fiscal year, largely due to mounting production costs and unresolved structural challenges.\n\nExport proceeds from the textile sector totalled $1.53bn in May, down from $1.55bn in the same month last year. This followed a 1.35pc contraction in April.\n\nAs a result, textile and clothing export growth during July-May FY25 stood at 7.37pc, reaching $16.36bn compared to $15.24bn in the same period last year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
