It was organised by CESVI Pakistan in collaboration with partners including Fast Rural Development Program (FRDP), Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Sindh and Welthungerhilfe.\n\nThe event brought together key representatives from government, academia, civil society, UN agencies and the development sector.\n\nGiving a presentation titled the potential of climatic extremes over Sindh in an overly carbonised scenario, Chief Meteorolgist Ameer Hyder Laghari pointed out that while coal-based projects, including the one in Tharparkar, would continue to develop Pakistan’s economic strength in the future, such an economic development would not come without a cost.\n\n“The cost is increased in carbon dioxide in ambient environment which will trigger extreme events like heatwaves, floods, hill flash flood etc., with even higher frequencies,” he warned.\n\nThe coal-based power generation projects recently installed in Sindh have special tendencies to add significant amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, he added.\n\n“The number of heatwave days has increased by up to 54 days in the centrally focused regions of the Sindh. This also includes Karachi, Mithi and Nagarparkar where an additional 35-40 days are increased in the heatwave days under a high end emission scenario,” he shared.\n\nAccording to him, oceanic saturation of carbon dioxide will become the reason for its enhanced concentration along the coastal regions that would further intensify the number of heatwave days in the future.\n\n“Monsoonal winds are vulnerable to carry additional CO2 from the ocean and divert it towards the coastal belt of the province. Future projections of total precipitation, on the divergent, are forecasting increased amount of precipitation which means that the more rain will fall in smaller number of days, or in other words rain intensity will increase over Sindh in the future,” he said.\n\nA major highlight of the conference was the launch of a research study, Climate-Smart Agriculture as a Disaster Risk Reduction Strategy in Vulnerable Regions of Sindh, Pakistan: A Multi-District Comparative Analysis.\n\nPresented by leading academic researchers, the study showcased how adopting climate-smart agricultural practices can mitigate disaster risks, enhance food security, and support sustainable rural development in high-risk districts across the province.\n\nThe conference featured several technical sessions, highlighting key regional risk assessments and anticipated climate stressors such as rising temperatures, water scarcity, and irregular rainfall patterns, offering valuable insights into the province’s future climate landscape and its socio-economic implications.\n\n“This conference marks a milestone in our collective journey to integrate climate resilience into disaster risk reduction frameworks. The evidence shared today reaffirms that investing in climate-smart agriculture is not only a sustainability imperative but also a practical solution to protect lives, livelihoods and ecosystems in Sindh,” said Aisha Jamshed, Country Director of Welthungerhilfe.\n\nIn his remarks, Shayan Shah, Director of Operations at PDMA Sindh, emphasised the government’s commitment to acting on research-backed recommendations. He noted: “Sindh is on the frontlines of climate change, and strengthening local resilience is critical. The partnership between government institutions, NGOs and academia —exemplified here today — demonstrates how data-driven, community-rooted strategies can shape long-term policy and planning for a safer, more climate-resilient province.”\n\nFurther discussions focused on the disproportionate impact of climate change on agriculture-dependent communities and vulnerable populations.\n\nIt included a panel discussion on climate-smart solutions, which explored innovations in water conservation, resilient crop production, soil health management, and agri-tech integration.\n\nPanelists called for enhanced investment in climate-smart technologies and the replication of successful pilot projects across other at-risk districts in Sindh.\n\nThe conference concluded with a collective call for action to institutionalise climate-smart practices, mainstream disaster risk reduction into all development planning, and ensure that vulnerable communities remain at the heart of future climate adaptation strategies in the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
