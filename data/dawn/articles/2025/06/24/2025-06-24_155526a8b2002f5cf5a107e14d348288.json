The war of words soon turned physical with lawmakers from both sides of the aisle pushing and shoving each other near the speaker’s podium.\n\nSpeaker Sadiq warned members that such behaviour “would not be tolerated in the House”.\n\n“This is a place for debate, not brawls,” he said while admonishing the lawmakers.\n\nThe second scuffle took place between PTI’s Nisar Jatt and PPP’s Agha Rafiullah after the former called Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s recent foreign visit a “junket for recreation and not for diplomacy”.\n\nThe sergeant-at-arms and deputy sergeant-at-arms who tried to separate the two members were allegedly abused and thrashed by some opposition lawmakers.\n\nThe irate speaker decided to punish four opposition lawmakers but decided not to after both sides held a two-hour-long meeting in his chamber, sources told Dawn.\n\nLater, members from both sides of the aisle apologised for their remarks and actions.\n\nFBR’s arrest powers\n\nAmid the commotion, the finance minister announced the government has decided to restrict the arrest powers granted to FBR officers over alleged tax frauds. The powers, which allowed FBR officers to investigate tax fraud and make arrests, had made businesspersons and lawmakers apprehensive, who warned the excessive authority would be used to victimise taxpayers.\n\nAs per the government’s proposal, assistant or deputy commissioners could arrest tax defaulters after seeking approval from the commissioner.\n\nHowever, after opposition from businesspeople and lawmakers, the prime minister, last week, formed a committee to reevaluate the proposal.\n\nFinance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb told the house that under the new proposal, court warrants have been made a prerequisite for cases involving tax fraud of up to Rs50 million.\n\nEven in such cases, arrests can only be made on three conditions: if the accused doesn’t join the inquiry after three notices; if the accused attempts to abscond; and tampers with evidence.\n\nThe arrests must also be approved by a three-member FBR committee with the accused presented before a special judge within 24 hours, ensuring protection against arbitrary detention and abuse of authority.\n\nRelaxation for non-filers\n\nThe finance minister also announced that restrictions proposed on the purchase of assets by non-filers have been eased following the prime minister’s direction.\n\nNow, non-filers will be able to purchase residential property worth up to Rs50m, commercial plots or properties worth up to Rs100m and vehicles worth up to Rs7m.\n\nAdditionally, under the existing law, capital gains tax will not apply to property sold after six years of purchase, provided it was bought before July 1, 2024.\n\nHowever, it would be subject to a 4.5 to 6 per cent withholding tax on purchase, which he said was generally returned on filing returns.\n\nHe said the property in personal use for 15 or more years would not be subject to this withholding tax.\n\nThe minister also announced a collateral-free loan programme, offering credit of up to Rs1m to farmers owning up to 12.5 acres of land, to support the agriculture sector, especially small-scale farmers.\n\nThese loans will cover the costs of seeds, fertilisers, pesticides, diesel and other essential inputs.\n\nHealth and crop insurance facilities will also be provided under the scheme.\n\nThe government will also introduce an electronic warehouse receipt system, allowing farmers to store crops securely and obtain better market prices, thereby contributing to national food security.\n\nThe minister also announced a 20-year loan scheme for low-income individuals to help them build or purchase houses.\n\nUnder the Women Inclusive Finance Programme, loans worth approximately Rs14bn have been provided to over 193,000 women.\n\nIn the coming year, another Rs14bn will be extended to women with support from the Asian Development Bank, announced Mr Aurangzeb.\n\nOn the tax imposed on e-commerce transactions, the minister said the move was aimed at rationalising the tax scheme and helping the industry to flourish.\n\nHe further highlighted upcoming policy measures, including a new industrial policy, progress on the electric vehicle policy and comprehensive energy sector reforms aimed at achieving sustainable growth.\n\n‘Distortion’ caused by EFS\n\nMr Aurangzeb said the export facilitation schemes announced in the past “unintentionally distorted market prices” of cotton as they allowed exporters to import raw materials without paying taxes and duties.\n\nIt disrupted the prices of domestically produced cotton and yarn, adversely affecting local farmers.\n\nTo address this imbalance, the government has proposed sales tax on the import of raw cotton and yarn to reduce the price gap between imported and local products.\n\nHe said the government has proposed a tax of Rs10 per broiler chick due to the poultry industry’s minimal tax contribution.\n\nThe Minister warned the ongoing tensions in the Middle East may affect regional economic stability but assured the house that the government was “closely monitoring developments”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
