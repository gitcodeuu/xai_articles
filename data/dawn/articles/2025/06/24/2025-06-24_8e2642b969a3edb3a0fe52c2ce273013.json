Now it’s up to the opposition what traditions they wish to set for the House, he added.\n\nBhachar said the opposition would honour the ruling of the custodian of the House.\n\nFour ministers provided updates on their departments’ performance over the past year concerning public welfare and outlined their future programmes.\n\nMinister for Local Government Zeeshan Rafique presented a review of the Punjab Cities Programme, highlighting developmental schemes in 40 cities across 18 districts. He emphasised Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s goal for “end-to-end solutions” for urban issues, including sewerage, drainage, streetlights, roads and parks.\n\nHe announced that the first phase of the programme would soon begin in 61 cities, with plans to address urban needs for the next 25 years, using the Lahore Development Plan (LDP) as a model.\n\nProvincial Minister for Social Welfare Sohail Shaukat lauded the government’s “tax-free budget,” citing programmes like “Dhi Rani,” which has facilitated marriages of 3,000 girls, and the provision of wheelchairs to physically challenged persons. He announced plans to fund 5,000 more marriages under the Dhi Rani scheme this year and urged the opposition to identify deserving individuals in their constituencies for the purpose.\n\nMinister for Education Rana Sikandar Hayat Khan discussed the significant budgetary increases for education, from Rs32 billion to Rs100bn for school development and Rs18bn for higher education, this year.\n\nHe mentioned that the “School Meal Programme” has brought 83,000 out-of-school children into schools and increased enrollment, particularly in south Punjab. He also highlighted the “Matric in Technology” plan and the government’s initiative to train teachers in Scotland.\n\nProvincial Minister Malik Faisal Ayub Khokhar announced the issuance of ration cards for labourers, providing them with a ration worth Rs3,000 each, incurring a total project cost of Rs40bn. He also noted the increase in the minimum wage from Rs37,000 to Rs40,000.\n\nHe claimed that the Punjab government resolved over 100,000 complaints regarding unpaid minimum wages.\n\nProvincial Law Minister Sohaib Ahmad Barth showcased the Punjab government’s performance in road construction through a video, emphasising the introduction of e-tendering and the “transparent” construction of 12,000kms of roads. He outlined plans for the construction of ring roads and expressways.\n\nOpposition member Junaid Afzal Sahi criticised the budget, questioning its purpose if the government’s intent was merely to “favour” certain groups. He highlighted the apparent favouritism towards bureaucrats in the budget and challenged the sufficiency of the Rs40,000 minimum wage given the rising costs of daily-use items.\n\nHafiz Farhat, another PTI MPA, cited the Auditor General of Pakistan’s report, alleging Rs1 trillion irregularities within the Punjab government. He stressed the need for accountability and lamented the decrease in agriculture’s share of the GDP despite Pakistan being an agricultural country, comparing the current input costs to those in the previous governments’ tenures.\n\nOpposition MPA Sheikh Imtiaz accused the government of misleading the House regarding budget figures, claiming only Rs1,109bn were allocated in the previous development budget. He called for the finance minister’s resignation and questioned why the budget did not go to the standing committees. He also criticised the government for focusing more on road construction without addressing issues like out-of-school children or poverty in the province.\n\nPTI member Nadia Kharal voiced concerns over a 30pc reduction in farmers’ crop yields and the lack of specific packages for women in the budget despite a female chief minister heading the province. She also claimed an increase in harassment cases against women under the current administration.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
