  "content": "COLOMBO: Pakistan’s snooker campaign at the Asian 6-Red and Team Snooker Championship surged forward on Monday as all three cueists — Awaisullah Munir, seasoned campaigner Mohammad Asif and the consistent Mohammad Sajjad — secured their passage to the pre-quarterfinals following the conclusion of their group stage.\n\nDefending champion Awaisullah solidified his position by completing a perfect group stage run, securing his third consecutive victory.\n\nHe faced a determined challenge from India’s Pushpender Singh but emerged with a convincing 4-2 [1-51(37), 47(34)-0, 66-0, 10-46, 34-21, 33-21] win.\n\nSingh started strongly, taking the first frame with a 37 break. Awaisullah responded emphatically, winning the next two frames, including the third with a combined break of 66 (35+31). Singh levelled the match by claiming the fourth frame, but the 31-year-old Pakistani star held his nerve to clinch the final two frames and top his group.\n\nAsif, Pakistan’s most decorated cueist with five international titles, experienced both triumph and setback on Monday but did enough to qualify.\n\nThe 42-year-old began his day with a commanding 4-0 [40-1, 27-14, 27-24, 56(55)-4] victory over Oman’s Abdullah Al Raisi Ahmed.\n\nAsif controlled the match throughout, sealing the win in style with a superb 55 break in the final frame.\n\nHowever, he faced a stern test later against Sri Lanka’s Irshath Mohamed Thaha, ultimately succumbing 4-3 [5-47, 18-32, 66-0, 0-44(36), 42-18, 54(38)-4, 44(40)-0] in a tense seven-frame encounter.\n\nAsif took the first two frames, but Thaha fought back powerfully, winning the third with a combined 66 break (35+31). Asif leveled the match again after the fourth frame, but Thaha claimed the next two frames and held his nerve in the decider with a 40 break.\n\nDespite this loss, Asif’s two wins secured his place in the next round.\n\nSajjad ensured Pakistan’s clean sweep of qualifications with a dominant performance earlier in the day. The 40-year-old overwhelmed Sri Lanka’s Badurdeen Mohamed Musarra 4-0 [41-9, 35-1, 58(58)-5, 25-21].\n\nSajjad dictated the pace, winning the frames comfortably before producing a fine 58 break in the third frame and clinching the match in the fourth. This victory guaranteed his progression regardless of the outcome of his final group match against Malaysia’s Lim Kok Leong.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
