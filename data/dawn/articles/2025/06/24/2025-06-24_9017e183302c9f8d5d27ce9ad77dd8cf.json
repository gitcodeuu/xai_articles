We wanted to know more like who was involved and from where the papers were leaked. Anyhow, we directed them to consult students and come up with a viable proposal for the next meeting,” gonvenor of the subcommittee MNA Sabheen Ghoury told Dawn.\n\nShe said the Cambridge officials were asked to contact parents and students to get their point of view and feedback on this probe report.\n\nTo a query about the retake of exam, she said: “Ideally we are not in favour of a retake; we want maximum relief for students right now and we will ensure justice for students...in case some students opt for retake in October then we will ask Cambridge not to charge fee for them,” she said.\n\nIt is relevant to note here that parents and students had stated that four papers were leaked this year.\n\nTo this, National Assembly Standing Committee on Education headed by MNA Dr Azimuddin Zahid Lakhvi took up the matter in the main committee before forming the subcommittee. MNA Mohammad Ali Sarfraz, who attended the main committee and subcommittee as special invitee, pointed out that several papers were leaked and also presented paper codes and video evidence to the subcommittee.\n\nThe subcommittee was supposed to look into the authority and legal cover under which CIE is conducing examination in Pakistan, the number of examination per year, the number of students appearing per year and the cost of each examination.\n\nIt will also look into remedies and measures adopted by CIE in the past in the wake of leakage of questions papers.\n\nThe term of reference of the subcommittee stated that after hearing all sides, it will finalise actions that can safeguard students and take assurance from the CIE to take befitting measures to compensate students and to avert such incidents in future.\n\nThe subcommittee will meet again on June 30 to finalise its recommendations, which will be presented before the main committee.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 24th, 2025",
