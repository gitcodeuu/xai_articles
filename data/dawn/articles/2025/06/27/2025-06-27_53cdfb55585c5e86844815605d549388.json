  "content": "LAHORE: Owing to anticipated bird activity, runways at the Allama Iqbal International Airport will temporarily be closed for three hours a day from July 1 to Sept 15, the Pakistan Airport Authority (PAA) said on Thursday.\n\n“The runway closure will be in effect daily from 5am to 8am, starting July 1 until September 15, 2025,” according to the PAA NOTAM.\n\nIn case of emergency, the runway may be used at the pilot’s discretion, it said.\n\nThe move is aimed at reducing the risk posed by heightened bird activity during the monsoon season. The decision has been made in the wake of recent incidents involving bird strikes. All domestic and international airlines have been directed to revise their flight schedules in accordance with the temporary closure.\n\nLahore airport last year reportedly witnessed the highest number of bird strikes with 28 incidents, followed by 18 in Islamabad and 17 in Karachi.\n\n“Multan reported 14 cases, while Faisalabad recorded six. In total, nine PIA aircraft sustained direct damage from bird strikes last year, resulting in significant repair costs for the airline,” an official report said and added that this year, some 25 bird-hit incidents have been reported so far.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
