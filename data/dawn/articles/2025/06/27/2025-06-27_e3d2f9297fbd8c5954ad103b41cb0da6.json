Several sleeper cells have already been detained by security agencies, and surveillance of other threats is ongoing,” the minister told a press conference here on Thursday.\n\n“The government has imposed a ban on the use of drones for processions coverage or any other purpose. A decision on suspension of mobile services and ban on pillion riding will be made based on the evolving situation,” she said.\n\nAll necessary preparations to maintain law and order during Muharram had been completed across the province. “As in previous years, millions of mourners will participate in Majalis and processions to commemorate the sacrifices of Imam Hussain (R.A) while some events will also be organised by the Sunni community. In light of the ongoing Iran-Israel tensions, this year’s Muharram holds special significance. Therefore, religious scholars from all schools of thought have been urged to promote a message of peace, tolerance, and unity,” she said.\n\nArmy, Rangers called in for security\n\nShe said over 38,000 Majalis and more than 9,000 processions were expected across Punjab. “To secure security for them, over 238,000 policemen will be deployed along with 35,000 volunteers. Specialised units including Dolphin Force and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) will also remain active.”\n\nMs Bokhari said a strict code of conduct had been issued and any hate content on social media would be addressed by the cyber security force. She emphasised that there would be a complete ban on the use of drones for coverage or any other purposes during Muharram.\n\n“Anti-drone systems will be deployed, and additional systems are being hired from other agencies. Control rooms have been established in all major cities and are now operational. Wall chalking and hate banners will be completely banned.”\n\nIn 18 cities across Punjab, Safe City cameras would monitor processions and additional cameras were being installed, she said.\n\n“The minister said cold water and beverage stalls will be set up for mourners. All Sabeels will be registered and monitored by the food department to ensure quality. Wasa water tankers will sprinkle water on roads, and “Clinics on Wheels” will accompany processions. A detailed traffic management plan has also been prepared. District administrations will issue traffic advisories 24 hours prior to processions, and all relevant officers will assume their positions before June 29.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
