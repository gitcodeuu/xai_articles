  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday adjourned the hearing of petitions filed by the PTI seeking suspension of the sentence awarded to former prime minister Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi in the £190 million case, after NAB’s newly-appointed Special Prosecutor Javed Arshad sought more time for case preparation.\n\nThe division bench, comprising Acting Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif, heard arguments from the petitioners’ legal team comprising Barrister Salman Safdar, Niazullah Khan Niazi, Ali Bukhari and Shoaib Shaheen. On behalf of NAB, Special Prosecutor Arshad appeared along with the prosecution team.\n\nAt the outset, the courtroom was packed with PTI leaders, including KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, Omar Ayub, Faisal Javed, and sisters of the PTI founder Imran Khan.\n\nThe bench expressed displeasure at the overcrowded rostrum, with the chief justice warning that the court decorum must be maintained. The petitioners assured the bench that order would be restored, and unnecessary individuals then vacated the rostrum.\n\nLower court acquits PTI senior leaders in two cases\n\nDuring proceedings, Special Prosecutor Javed Arshad requested four weeks’ time for preparation of the case, citing complexity of the case and his recent appointment for the post. “This is a voluminous case and I was appointed just yesterday. I need time to study the case thoroughly,” Mr Arshad said.\n\nBarrister Salman Safdar objected to the request of Mr Arshad, saying that NAB had already constituted a prosecution team led by Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi and it had got enough time for preparation of the case.\n\nThe PTI lawyer pressed for the case to be heard on Monday. “We are ready to argue. If we’ve made a case, let’s argue it — why run from the appeal?”\n\nResponding to the challenge, Mr Arshad said: “We will play — just allow us to prepare the case.”\n\nIn a separate development, the Anti-Terrorism Court of Judge Abual Hasnat Mohammad Zulqarnain issued notices to summon absconding PTI workers in a case related to alleged firing on police during a rally in Tarnol.\n\nIn another case related to PTI, the District and Sessions Court ordered the acquittal of senior leaders of PTI in two cases registered with Karachi Company Police Station.\n\nJudicial Magistrate Shahzad Khan issued written verdicts acquitting Barrister Gohar, Omar Ayub, Ali Bukhari, Shoaib Shaheen, Aamir Masood Mughal, Muhammad Rafiq, and Aamir Dogar.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
