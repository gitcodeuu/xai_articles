After obtaining their personal and banking details, the suspects would start threatening them to extort money. The extorted money was then transferred through internet banking and other digital platforms, it added.\n\nRegarding their modus operandi, the agency stated that initial analysis of the recovered mobile phones and other devices showed the use of applications such as “Friends Search for WhatsApp” and Voice over IP (VoIP) software. Through these tools, the suspects allegedly accessed WhatsApp contact lists of foreigners and made spoofed calls, falsely informing them they had won lotteries worth thousands of euros, dollars or dirhams.\n\nUsing the VoIP software, the suspects allegedly impersonated officials and tricked victims into sharing sensitive credentials. They also allegedly stole credit card information of their clients and transferred the funds into their own accounts.\n\nThe agency further claimed that the recovered digital data included spoofed communications, sensitive personal information of victims, and forged documents bearing logos of international money transfer services such as MoneyGram, Lycamobile, Western Union, as well as panaflex banners printed with the emblem of the Kuwaiti police, the State of Kuwait, and its Ministry of Interior.\n\nA day before, the NCCIA had booked the 18 men under Sections 3 (Unauthorised access to information system or data), Section 4 (Unauthorised copying or transmission of data), Section 6 (Unauthorised access to critical infrastructure information system or data), Section 13 (Electronic forgery), Section 14 (Electronic fraud), Section 16 (Unauthorised use of identity information) and Section 26 (Spoofing) of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016 read with Section 419 (Punishment for cheating by personation), Section 420 (Cheating and dishonestly Inducing delivery of property) and Section 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC).\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
