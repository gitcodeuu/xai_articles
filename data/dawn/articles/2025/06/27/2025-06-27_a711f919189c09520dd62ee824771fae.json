Resources have been distributed without any bias. If we continue to use our resources without discrimination, most of our problems will vanish.”\n\nHighlighting the fiscal achievements of his administration, he said the newly passed budget was “tax-free, deficit-free, and built entirely on self-reliance.”\n\n“Despite an estimated shortfall of Rs19 billion, we managed to close the budget with zero-balancing. This is a remarkable step towards financial independence,” he stated.\n\nMr Haq emphasised the government’s focus on improving public service sectors.\n\nReferring to infrastructure development, he said the government planned to construct or recondition 500 kilometres of roads.\n\nHe said that an allocation of Rs1 billion for resettlement of post-1989 refugees had been carried forward.\n\n“Work has already begun on the construction of 700 houses for them.”\n\nBefore the House was prorogued by the chair sine die, it also adopted three resolutions addressing national and international developments.\n\nIn the first resolution, the House denounced Indian Home Minister Amit Shah’s remarks rejecting the Indus Waters Treaty as a serious breach of international law, while also condemning Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir. It called on the UN and global bodies to take urgent notice of growing Hindutva-fuelled extremism and recent Israeli attacks on Iran, urging the OIC to foster unity among Muslim nations.\n\nAnother resolution, moved by former premier Haider, urged the federal government to raise the issue of jailed Kashmiri leader Syed Shabbir Ahmad Shah, suffering from cancer, and called on the UN Secretary-General to ensure his access to medical care and family.\n\nThe third resolution, tabled by Rehabilitation Minister Javed Iqbal Budhanvi, praised Pakistan and Iran’s responses to aggression and lauded PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari for effectively presenting Pakistan’s and Kashmir’s case on global platforms.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
