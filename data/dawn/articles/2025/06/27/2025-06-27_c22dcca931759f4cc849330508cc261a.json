  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Assembly Special Committee on Gender Mainstreaming on Thursday marked the International Day of Parliamentarism by unanimously passing a resolution reaffirming its commitment to gender equality and inclusive governance.\n\nExpressing deep concern over Pakistan’s placement at 148 out of 146 countries in the Global Gender Gap Index Report 2025, the committee, chaired by MNA Dr Nafisa Shah, acknowledged that the ranking also reflected weaknesses in data collection and reporting. However, it underscored the urgency of concrete reforms and policy action to address systemic gender disparities.\n\nAccording to a statement, the committee voiced frustration over the lack of implementation of its earlier recommendations and called on the federal government to constitute a cabinet committee on gender mainstreaming.\n\nSuch a body, it emphasised, would ensure political ownership and drive meaningful progress toward women’s empowerment at the federal level. The inclusion of women parliamentarians in budgetary and development processes was also strongly advocated.\n\nAs part of global observances of the International Day of Parliamentarism - commemorated each year on June 30 following a 2018 UN General Assembly resolution - the committee aligned its discussions with the Inter-Parliamentary Union’s campaign “Achieving Gender Equality: Action by Action.” This year’s focus included three key themes such as promoting gender parity in parliaments, fostering gender-sensitive institutions and combating gender-based violence and discrimination.\n\nThe committee also formed a subcommittee to review family and inheritance laws applicable in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). The subcommittee will be led by Senator Saadia Abbasi as convener with MNAs Munaza Hassan, Shahida Begum and Senator Fawzia Arshad as members.\n\nIts terms of reference included reviewing legislation and suggesting necessary amendments to the Dowry and Bridal Gifts (Restriction) Act 1976, West Pakistan Family Courts Act 1964, Muslim Marriage Act 1939 and the Guardian and Wards Act 1880.\n\nThe subcommittee was expected to submit its report within one month.\n\nThe meeting was attended by MNAs and Senators including Aqeel Malik, Shaista Pervaiz, Shahida Rehmani, Rubina Qaim Khani, Khalida Ateeb and relevant officials from concerned ministries and divisions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
