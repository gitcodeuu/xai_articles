The maximum temperature recorded was 38 degrees Celsius.\n\nWhile the showers exposed the city’s perennial infrastructure woes, the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has forecast more rains in the coming days.\n\nAlmost all city areas plunged into darkness with the start of the rain.\n\nGulshan-i-Iqbal, Gulistan-i-Jauhar, Malir, Landhi, North Karachi, Clifton, Saddar, Nazimabad and Gulshan-i-Maymar experienced moderate to heavy rainfall, while heavy showers were also reported on the city outskirts.\n\nThe PMD said that the monsoon system entered Sindh from the southeast, triggering rain across Karachi.\n\nSeveral parts of the city witnessed flashes of lightning accompanying rainfall.\n\nThe impact of the rain was quickly felt across the metropolis as many neighbourhoods witnessed power outages. Electricity feeders tripped due to the wet conditions.\n\nMeanwhile, rainwater also accumulated in several low-lying areas, particularly in parts of Korangi, Liaquatabad, and Orangi Town. Many vehicles broke down due flooding on roads.\n\nMunicipal authorities had earlier claimed to have cleaned major storm-water drains ahead of the monsoon, but Thursday’s rain that inundated streets and roads, raised concerns about the city’s preparedness.\n\nKarachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, in a late evening statement, said that drainage teams were on the ground and that efforts were underway to clear clogged areas.\n\nRains across Sindh\n\nThe rains ended the prolonged dry spell across Sindh, bringing relief from the sweltering weather conditions. Meanwhile, three children died in two separate rain related incidents.\n\nOppressive heat was being reported in many districts since last month and the Met Office had made a forecast two days back about an early monsoon rainfall till from June 25 to June 28.\n\nWhile weather turned pleasant in all areas that received rainfall, the joy proved short-lived as power breakdowns were reported in several areas, plunging many districts of Hesco region into darkness.\n\nIn Hyderabad the rain that started at 8.15pm continued for 30 minutes.\n\nBarring a few days of June’s third week, the temperature in Hyderabad had been consistently at 40 degrees Celsius or above.\n\nThe Thursday’s temperature was recorded at 40.5 degree Celsius and the people were experiencing suffocating weather conditions since morning that peaked in the evening and ultimately strong gusty winds started to blow to precede the rainfall.\n\nRooftop of a seminary in Tandojam’s Muzzafarabad Colony caved in, resulting in death of two children. They were identified as Waheedullah, and Zain. Around 13 children were injured in the incident. Reports suggest that the rooftop of an adjacent house had first fallen on seminary causing its collapse as well.\n\nThe injured were taken to Liaquat University Hospital, City branch, from Tandojam.\n\nAnother child Fayyaz Phulphoto died in Khairpur when the roof of his house collapsed in a village.\n\nPower supply went off as soon as rains started in most areas.\n\nA Hesco spokesman confirmed that 45 feeders of Hyderabad city remained disturbed out of 156 and 90 feeders faced issues in rest of the Hesco region, which has 659 feeders.\n\nDust storm visited areas of Babarloi, Tando Masti, Shah Hussain, Thehri that also damaged solar power systems at various locations. Rains also damaged date palm trees.\n\nSevere heat had been reported in Tando Mohammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Sanghar districts. The areas received rains in the evening.\n\nGusty winds and rainfall were reported from Matiari.\n\nBadin also received light rain which continued at a moderate speed, causing accumulation of water on city roads. No casualty was reported.\n\nRainfall with thunderstorm hit Mirpurkhas and its outskirts.\n\nThere are reports of rains from Mirwah Gorchani, Digri, Jhuddo, Tando Jan Muhammad, Kot Ghulam Muhammad, Sindhri, Naokot, Jhilori, etc.\n\nFarmers have expressed their happiness as they were facing acute water shortages for their cultivated crops, including cotton.\n\nHeavy rainfall accompanied by a severe thunderstorm lashed Thatta and Sujawal districts, leading to considerable damage, particularly to the agricultural sector and vulnerable communities in coastal areas.\n\nFurthermore, several huts in the coastal belt of Thatta were severely damaged.\n\nWarning of urban flooding\n\nEarlier, the Pakistan Meteorological Department had released an urban flooding warning for several cities, including Karachi.\n\nAccording to the department’s advisory, “a westerly wave grips western parts of the country, which are also seeing continued penetration of the monsoon currents”. The latter weather system is likely to intensify further.\n\nIt said that Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Badin, Thatta, Sujawal, Dadu, Sukkur, Larkana, Khairpur, Naushahro Feroze, Shaheed Benazirabad, Hyderabad, Tharparkar, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Jamshoro, Tando Allahyar, Tando Muhammad Khan, Jacobabad, Ghotki and Kashmore could receive rains.\n\nThe department warned that heavy downpour/windstorm and lightning would affect daily routines, leading to urban flooding and water-logging in low-lying areas.\n\nThe Pakistan Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) has directed all concerned deputy commissioners/relevant authorities and stakeholders to take all necessary measures.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
