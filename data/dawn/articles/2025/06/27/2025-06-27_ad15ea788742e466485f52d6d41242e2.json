  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) is seeking funds from the government to ensure the national team’s participation in the 2025-26 FIH Pro League in case New Zealand withdrew from the said event.\n\nFunding of $2.5 million is required by Pakistan to participate in the event if New Zealand, who outplayed Pakistan 6-2 in the FIH Nations Cup final in Kuala Lumpur recently, pull out.\n\nAddressing a press conference in Islamabad on Thursday, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid, alongside Pakistan Sports Board director general Yasir Prizada, said that the federation would look to send the team to the FIH Pro League if an opportunity arose.\n\nAccording to Mujahid, the PHF had requested Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for financial support, adding that the federation had also requested Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir for financial support.\n\n“The PHF federation wants confirmation of [the] financial support as soon as possible, as once committed, we cannot pull out as in that scenario the International Hockey Federation (FIH) could impose a ban [on Pakistan],” Mujahid said at the presser.\n\nOn the other hand, the FIH, according to media reports, denied that it had invited Pakistan to join the Pro League amid some reports of New Zealand’s withdrawal due to its financial constraints.\n\nAccording to the FIH rule, the winners of the Nations Cup are given the opportunity to join the Pro League in the forthcoming season. If the winning team withdraw, then the runners-up get the chance to feature in the Pro League.\n\nThe FIH said that so far, New Zealand had not yet conveyed the decision to the federation regarding participation in the Pro League.\n\nMeanwhile, Mujahid said that Pakistan’s junior team will participate in the Junior Asia Cup being held in China adding the squad for this event was likely to be announced on Friday.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Yasir said that providing $2.5 million to the PHF for the Pro League was beyond the capacity of the PSB.\n\n“The PHF has submitted its proposal regarding Pro League [participation] and the PSB will review it,” Yasir said.\n\n“We are committed to doing whatever is possible for the PHF within our available resources.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 27th, 2025",
