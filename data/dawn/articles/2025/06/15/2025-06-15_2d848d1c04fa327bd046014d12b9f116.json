  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The PTI on Saturday said the government policies have damaged multiple sectors, especially the energy sector that led to a hefty increase in tariffs, making electricity unaffordable for most people.\n\nThese claims were made by National Assembly Opposition Leader Omar Ayub at a media talk, where he was flanked by Senate Opposition Leader Shibli Faraz, PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram, and party leader Taimur Jhagra.\n\nMr Ayub claimed the PTI government had laid the foundation for a strong and competitive power sector. However, all the projects started by the PTI had been scrapped by the current government, he alleged.\n\n“During our tenure, electricity was available at much lower prices, but today, the prices have skyrocketed beyond the reach of the common man,” he added.\n\nOpposition leader says transmission system outdated and insufficient to meet rising demand\n\nAccording to the PTI leader, the power infrastructure was deteriorating.\n\n“Even Islamabad, served by Iesco, faces frequent power cuts. The power lines and feeders across the country are outdated and insufficient in meeting the rising demand. While electricity demand grows, the number of feeders in many areas remains alarmingly low.”\n\nHe expressed his strong rejection of the current budget, stating, “The government is unable to digest affordable electricity usage and insists that the common man should pay for the expensive (grid) electricity.\n\nThe power projects started in 2018, initially valued at Rs450 billion, have now ballooned to over Rs2,000 billion due to poor governance and flawed policies.“\n\nIt may be noted that the federal budget proposed a 18 per cent tax on the import of solar panels.\n\nHe also criticised the frequent adjustments to the Fuel Price Adjustment (FPA) in electricity bills, saying, “Every three months, the government changes the FPA rates, and it is the common people who bear the brunt of these decisions.”\n\nThe PTI leader warned, “Global markets are shutting down, regional conflicts are escalating, and our country faces a potential deficit increase of Rs6,501 billion. There are looming risks of oil shortages and sudden interest rate hikes. The government must be held accountable for these failures.”\n\nOn the occasion, Senator Faraz said that the ongoing regional war would inevitably drive petrol prices even higher, worsening the economic strain on ordinary Pakistanis.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Sheikh Waqas claimed that the PTI’s experts transparently presented the budget to the public, while also highlighting the glaring gap between electricity demand and supply.\n\nHe said that the current state of electricity in Pakistan, especially in rural areas, was deeply unsatisfactory, as regions like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan were enduring 12 to 18 hours of load-shedding daily, with Sindh and Punjab facing a similar crisis.\n\n“Beyond the power crisis, serious human rights concerns are unfolding. Prisoners in the Kot Lakhpat military trial are facing the worst kind of political retribution, as they are deprived of basic rights, especially under the harsh heat, and are being denied the right to appeal,” he claimed.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Taimur Jhagra said that the government’s plan to privatise only Lesco, Fesco, and Iesco would not benefit the entire country.\n\n“Millions in the ex-Fata region have been entirely denied the facility of electricity — who will be held accountable?” he questioned.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2025",
