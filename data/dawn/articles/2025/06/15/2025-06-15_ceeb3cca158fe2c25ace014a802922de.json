Such a development would be devastating for the region, sending shockwaves across the globe.\n\nSome media reports say that the US had shipped hundreds of missiles to Israel before the attack on Iran, while there are also indications that American forces helped shoot down Iranian missiles headed for Israel. Tehran has said it will hit American as well as British and French bases if these states defend Tel Aviv.\n\nIn the midst of conflict, President Donald Trump must be asked why he did not do more to stop Israel’s attack on Iran. Tel Aviv’s justification that it is waging ‘pre-emptive’ strikes to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb rings hollow, coming from a state believed to have a clandestine nuclear programme itself, and which has violated the sovereignty of nearly all its neighbours.\n\nMr Trump had billed himself a ‘man of peace’, but in this instance he is standing by as Israeli warmongers, flush with American cash and arms, have embarked on a destructive adventure that can set the Middle East alight.\n\nEven some of Mr Trump’s ardent supporters in the MAGA movement have criticised the Israeli war and potential American involvement. The US president’s calls for Tehran to resume dialogue on the nuclear issue are laughable, especially at a time when Iran is facing an onslaught from America’s key ally.\n\nSimilarly, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s appeals for Iranians to rise up against their government and seek ‘freedom’ are the stuff of black humour, as Israel has killed and injured numerous ordinary Iranians in the ongoing aggression. Mr Netanyahu, so concerned about Iranians’ freedom, clearly does not feel Palestinians are also entitled to life and liberty, as the Gaza genocide has shown.\n\nWith prospects for peace looking dim, the world, particularly Iran’s neighbours — including Pakistan and the Middle East states — must be prepared for prolonged geopolitical turbulence and economic tremors. The region is amongst the world’s trade and energy hubs, and if the conflict continues and intensifies, the global order will feel the heat.\n\nPakistan, as a neighbour of Iran, is particularly vulnerable, and the state must be ready for what lies ahead, while also making efforts to safely bring home Pakistani zaireen and visitors in Iran.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2025",
