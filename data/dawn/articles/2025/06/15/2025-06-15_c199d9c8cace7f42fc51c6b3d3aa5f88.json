  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The healthcare workers of at least five public hospitals in Islamabad are up in arms against the recent budget, which did not offer them any incentives, such as the disparity reduction allowance announced for other government employees.\n\nThey were also disgruntled about the government’s decision to ignore their demand for the restoration of the health risk allowance, suspended in 2014. The allowance, which was equal to a basic salary, was introduced by the PPP government in 2011 but withdrawn by the PML-N government in 2014.\n\nUnion leader Chaudhry Qamar Javed Gujar, speaking at a press conference alongside other union leaders, said that a number of departments, including the PM’s Office, had received a raise in their salaries from 80 per cent to 300 per cent, but the hospital employees were ignored in the federal budget. He was accompanied by employees of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims), Polyclinic, National Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine (NIRM), Capital Hospital, Federal General Hospital, and staff of the District Health Office.\n\nMr Gujar claimed that even the disparity reduction allowance (DRA) was not announced for the health workers, adding that the employees of other ministries had gotten a 30pc DRA. He said that a general body meeting of the Pims employees was held on Saturday, in which it was decided that they would not rest until their health risk allowance was restored. “We serve patients day and night, but our rights are being denied,” he claimed. He said the hospital employees would be mobilised for a massive protest movement and the government would be solely responsible for any consequences.\n\nUnion reps say will go on strike if demands not met by Monday\n\n“Do not push us to the limit where we don’t have any choice but to lock down hospitals. We know the critical condition in which patients arrive in hospitals but unfortunately, the government has no idea about their situation. It is unfortunate that the salaries of ministers and advisors have been increased, but health staff are being deprived of their due right,” Mr Gujar said.\n\nDr Asfandyar hoped that the health minister would intervene in the restoration of the health risk allowance. Paramedics President Chaudhry Anas said that employees were considering all possible options to secure their rights and may opt for a strike if there was no positive development by Monday. He said the government must act wisely and avoid pushing employees to go on strike.\n\nNurses’ leader Mr Liaquat said that Pims employees would remain united. Tanveer Noshah said that it was unfortunate that the health workers were ignored, adding that the pension of the retired employees should also be increased.\n\nAll union representatives rejected the federal budget and expressed serious concerns. They stated that health workers were consistently ignored in the last three federal budgets, adding that during Covid-19 and other emergencies, health workers were forced to risk their lives and serve under emergency conditions.\n\nThose who attended the meeting included Madam Naila, Liaquat Ogahi, Shahid Jan Khattak, Tanveer Noshahi, Sharif Khattak, Chaudhry Usman, Umar Swati, Raja Amjad, Chaudhry Anas, Naveed Azad, Tariq Mattoo, Raja Rabnawaz, Irfan Iqbal Bhatti, and others.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2025",
