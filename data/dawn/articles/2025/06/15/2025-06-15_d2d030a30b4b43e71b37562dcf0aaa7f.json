Upon inquiry, it was revealed that the individual listed as the owner was not registered with the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) and disclaimed any knowledge of these properties.\n\nThe Benamidar has stated that her Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) had been misused for registration of these plots. Subsequent to a thorough investigation, a reference was filed before the Benami Adjudicating Authority Bench-I Islamabad, and the case was decided in favour of the Benami Zone-I, Islamabad.\n\nMoreover, the adjudicating authority has also issued confiscation order of these properties. Following the completion of all legal procedures, the properties were confiscated with the assistance of local law enforcement agencies.\n\nThis action aligns with the government’s intensified efforts against benami assets, which gained momentum in July 2019 with the establishment of three anti-benami zones across the country.\n\nThese zones, operating under the supervision of a directorate general ABI, have filed over 187 references involving various categories of assets, including shares, bank accounts, vehicles, land and buildings.\n\nThe ABI Zone-I, Islamabad, has been actively involved in identifying and investigating benami properties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Civil Division of Rawalpindi and Islamabad Capital Territory.\n\nThe successful confiscation of these plots mark a significant step in the government’s ongoing campaign to eliminate benami transactions, non-documentation of economy, detect/catch the ill-gotten and untaxed money, curb white collar crimes and generate resources for the state, added the announcement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2025",
