  "content": "KARACHI: Low to moderate intensity earthquakes hit parts of Karachi and Pasni on Saturday. However, there were immediate no reports of any casualty or infrastructure damage.\n\nAccording to the seismic centre of the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), the first tremor struck at 9:53am and measured 3.2 on the Richter scale. The epicentre was recorded 12 kilometres north of Malir, at a depth of 35km.\n\nThe tremor was felt in the areas of Shah Faisal Colony, Quaidabad and around Gulzar-i-Hijri.\n\nThe PMD’s data showed the latest seismic activity in Karachi raised the tally of low-intensity tremors to 39 since June 1.\n\nLater in the day, an earthquake measuring 4.7 on the Richter scale was recorded in and around Pasni at 6.23pm. Its epicentre was located 60km southwest of Pasni, at a depth of 14km.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Chief Meteorologist Ameer Hyder Leghari explained that while the seismic activity being experienced in Karachi was largely caused by the reactivation of Landhi-Korangi fault line, the tremors in the coastal parts of Balochistan was the energy being periodically released from the Makran subduction zone.\n\n“It has always been a seismically active zone, generating earthquakes of minor intensity occasionally. It’s the same region which produced a tsunami, in 1945, killing over 4,000 people along Pakistan’s coast and neighbouring countries,” he said.\n\nHe pointed out that Karachi was surrounded by five active and several non-active fault lines.\n\nAccording to experts, the fault lines passing along the areas of Landhi, Quaidabad, Gadap and Malir have become active after several decades and causing minor earthquakes in areas close to them.\n\nThe experts have rejected public concern, stating that minor seismic activities “pre-empt high-intensity earthquakes” by constantly releasing accumulated energy within the tectonic plates and that the seismic activity will gradually settle down.\n\n“Upper parts of the country including Islamabad are seismically more active than country’s southern region. There is a [low intensity] earthquake almost daily in Islamabad but it doesn’t attract public attention,” Mr Leghari said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2025",
