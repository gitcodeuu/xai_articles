  "content": "CHARSADDA: Business community, teachers and a cross section of the society have rejected the federal budget, saying it would add to the woes of the common man, already burdened by never ending inflation.\n\nThey said the federal budget would bring in more inflation and increase tax burden and termed the 10 percent increase in salaries of government employees a mere joke.\n\nWhile talking to Dawn about the budget, social activists Haji Abdul Salam, Arif Zahoor, Ahmed Zarif Khel, Tariq Jan, leaders of trade organisations Haji Siddiqullah, Hakimullah Fauji, Irshad Ali Malik, Haji Zafar Khan and office-bearers of teachers association, pensioners Abdul Haq, Safdar Khan said that there was no relief for the common man in the budget while inflation and taxes have multiplied the problems of the poor, adding the increase in taxes on food items, electricity, gas, petrol and other necessities of life is making the life of the common man even more miserable.\n\nThey said that the rulers had made substantial raise in their personal expenses while not even a modest relief is given to the poor and called for cutting the government expenditures to accommodate masses.\n\nOn the other hand, representatives of teachers’ organizations said that when inflation rate in the country had crossed 40 per cent, only 10 per cent increase in salaries is insufficient and a joke with the people.\n\nThey pointed out that the salaries of high-ranking officials, including the Senate chairman and the National Assembly speaker have been increased more than 600 percent, who are already enjoying huge perks and privileges, adding that the salary must be enhanced at least 30 per cent for discharging their responsibilities amicably.\n\nThe business community also severely criticized the budget, calling it a document prepared under the direction of the IMF. It is budget of the capitalist class, while small traders, workers and the poor have been completely ignored, they added.\n\nDISCONNECTED: The Pesco Charsadda has disconnected electricity of the offices of the tehsil chairman and TMA Charsadda due to non-payment of tube-wells arrears.\n\nMunicipal Workers Union Charsadda strongly reacted to Pesco action and demanded immediate notice from the deputy commissioner and the Pesco high-ranking officials.\n\nIt warned if no action was taken, they would launch a protest movement and they may decide to shut down municipal services in the area. President of Municipal Workers Union Charsadda, Marjan Ali, said that the Pesco disconnected electricity of TMA Charsadda without any prior information or notice.\n\nHe said that as per the clear orders of the provincial government, TMA Charsadda is making it possible to supply water to the homes of the people through tube wells, which is a basic facility and necessity, adding due to its low recovery and non-payment of funds to provincial government arrears have accumulated.\n\nMarjan Ali termed this move as regrettable and unfair, saying that the electricity shutdown in the intense heat is a crime against TMA employees and the public who are benefiting from these tube-wells. He said it is injustice and an open joke with the people of Charsadda city and called upon the deputy commissioner take immediate notice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 15th, 2025",
