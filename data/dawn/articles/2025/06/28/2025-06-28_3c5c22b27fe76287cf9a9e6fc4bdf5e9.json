It is home to a rich variety of native flora and fauna. With the proposed ecotourism development, the annual visitor footfall is expected to be 1.5m, reflecting increased public interest in nature-based recreation and conservation tourism.\n\nAccording to the officials, key attractions such as the Botanical Bird Paradise with Butterfly Garden, Mini Zoo, and Animal Enclosures are designed to foster biodiversity awareness, promote wildlife education, and support species conservation efforts. A range of engaging facilities including an Information Centre, Amphitheatre, Craft Bazaar, Picnic Areas, and a Heritage Walk will provide visitors with a diverse blend of recreational, and cultural experiences.\n\nImmersive nature experiences such as the jeep safari, electric tram rides, watch towers and jeep tracks have been planned for the tourists. The visitors will engage with the environment through a variety of well conceived, eco-friendly facilities that enable immersive and responsible interaction with the forest’s natural landscapes and wildlife.\n\nA medical centre will be established to provide prompt emergency healthcare services, with special preparedness for incidents such as snake bites and other wildlife-related injuries, ensuring the safety and well-being of visitors, staff, and researchers. The project also emphasises capacity building and community empowerment through training programs for staff and local stakeholders.\n\nThe officials say that the development of ecotourism at Uchali Lake and Chashma is projected to attract 250,000 visitors annually at each site, providing opportunities for nature-based recreation while ensuring the preservation and protection of sensitive habitats through regulated access, infrastructure planning, and visitor education.\n\nThe sites will feature a variety of eco-accommodation options such as ecolodges and glamping pods, offering comfortable yet environmentally responsible stays. Boating and fishing decks, along with kids’ play zones will provide family-friendly and immersive outdoor experiences that encourage engagement with nature in a safe and controlled manner.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
