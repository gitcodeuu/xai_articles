Q1 was good, but I knew there were a few places I could get more time and I did what I planned to do.”\n\nVerstappen had taken pole position at the Red Bull-owned circuit in the Styrian Alps for the last five F1 races before Norris succeeded and seized his first pole in Austria, his third of the season and 12th of his career.\n\nTeam-mate Piastri was disappointed and frustrated.\n\n“I had [Pierre] Gasly spin at the first corner so I didn’t even open my second lap. Lando’s been very quick all weekend so it would have been a tough challenge, but we had the pace to be on the front row,” he said.\n\n“We can still have a good race from there and we are not here to come home third.”\n\nVerstappen’s last lap was stymied by a yellow flag waved when Gasly spun in his Alpine, leaving him, like Piastri, unable to clock a flying lap time. He finished seventh.\n\nLeclerc said: “I’m very pleased. It’s been a long time since we started on the front row and it’s been a difficult season overall, but the team has kept pushing.\n\n“We brought some new parts this weekend which for sure made a difference. We know we have a better car in the race than in qualifying so I hope we can put more pressure on the McLarens.”\n\nLeclerc’s Ferrari team-mate and seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton was an encouraging fourth ahead of Mercedes’ George Russell, Liam Lawson of Racing Bulls, four-time champion Verstappen of Red Bull and Gabriel Bortoleto of Sauber.\n\nItalian rookie Kimi Antonelli was ninth in the second Mercedes and Gasly 10th.\n\nThe session began in hot conditions with temperatures of 32° Celsius (air) and 48°C (track), indicating hard work for tyres.\n\nAfter a frantic finale, in which Russell recovered from the drop zone to 11th, it was Aston Martin’s Lance Stroll, Esteban Ocon of Haas, Red Bull’s Yuki Tsunoda, Carlos Sainz in the second Williams and Sauber’s Nico Hulkenberg who were eliminated.\n\nMcLaren, led by Norris, set the pace.\n\nThe entire field was separated by less than a second with the Red Bulls of Verstappen and Tsunoda, sixth and 18th, only 0.25 seconds apart. It was Sainz’s third consecutive Q1 exit.\n\nThe track temperature touched 50 at the start of Q2 with Ferrari leading the way on used softs as Norris established his supremacy again before a trackside grass fire prompted a red flag stoppage, Hamilton having run wide there at turn 10.\n\nVerstappen was unhappy with his car’s reaction to the heat. “No grip, it’s worse than before,” he reported. “I don’t know what to say!”\n\nAfter six minutes, the action resumed with only four to go as Norris and Piastri set the pace ahead of Leclerc while two-time champion Fernando Alonso of Aston Martin, Williams’ Alex Albon, Racing Bulls rookie Isack Hadjar, Franco Colapinto of Alpine and Oliver Bearman of Haas missed out.\n\nAll of this left Bortoleto celebrating his first top ten qualification in fifth for the improving Sauber outfit, while Verstappen complained he was impeded by a Ferrari in a way that was “a bit naughty and super unnecessary”.\n\nAs Q3 began, Russell almost hit a Ferrari when he was released into their path, narrowly avoiding a collision.\n\nOn the first runs, Norris was fastest again, ahead of Leclerc with Piastri third and Hamilton fourth, the Ferraris enjoying the heat as Mercedes wilted before Norris stormed to pole.",
