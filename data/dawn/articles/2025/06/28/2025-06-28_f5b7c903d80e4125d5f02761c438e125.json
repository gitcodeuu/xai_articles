Locals tried to save the trapped tourists, with one man, Muha­mmad Hilal, rescuing three people from the gushing river. According to the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Provincial Disaster Management Aut­hority (PDMA), 16 persons were washed away, of whom three were rescued and nine dead bodies have been recovered. Four persons were still missing.\n\nPDMA has put the death toll at 10, including four men, three women and four children.\n\nIn its report, the authority claimed the victims “went into the [middle] of River Swat”.\n\nEarlier, the PDMA had issued a flood alert after water as the discharge level in Swat river at Khwazakhela surged to 77,782 cusecs — a very high flood state.\n\nFayaz Zafar, a local journalist, said despite the warning, the district administration didn’t take preventive measures, such as imposing Section 144, which could have restricted public access to riverbanks.\n\nLocals also pointed to gravel mining in the riverbed as a contributing factor to the disaster, as it “altered the natural flow of the river”, making it more prone to flooding.\n\nDeaths in other areas\n\nAccording to PDMA, six people got trapped in flooded water bodies in Lower Dir. Five of them were rescued, while the search for one person, who drowned near Ghari Rahimabad, was underway.\n\nThey included two women, as many children and an elderly man, officials said.\n\nThe dead body of one person was also recovered from the Swat river in Malakand.\n\nIn Abbottabad, Rescue 1122 recovered the bodies of two children who drowned in the Door river on Thursday.\n\nAccording to officials, the identities of the deceased had not been confirmed. Their bodies were shifted to Civil Hospital, Havelian for legal formalities.\n\nThe region received heavy rainfall, especially in Abbottabad and the surrounding hilly areas of Galiyat, which inundated residential areas and flooded water bodies.\n\nThe main Abbottabad-Mansehra Road remained blocked for several hours at Supply and at Kala Pul due to overflowing water.\n\nIn Door river has also swelled in Harno, Abbottabaed, after which, the local administration warned tourists against approaching the riverbank.\n\nAdditionally, police have set up a checkpoint on the road leading to the river to restrict public access.\n\nResponding swiftly to emergency calls, the Rescue 1122 Water Rescue and Disaster Team rushed to both sites. After intense efforts, they successfully evacuated all the trapped individuals to safety without any casualties.\n\nIn Shangla, three vehicles were damaged after being hit by falling rocks during a landslide, triggered by heavy rains in Bely Baba area on Friday morning.\n\nFlash floods were also reported in different rivers, including the Indus.\n\nUmar Rehman, the Shangla police spokesperson, told Dawn the vehicles which were parked near a hotel.\n\nHe said a portion of the hotel was also affected by the landslide. However, no casualties were reported.\n\nRashid Javed in Abbottabad, Umar Bacha in Shangla and Haleem Asad in Lower Dir contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
