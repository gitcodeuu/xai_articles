Malik and Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi had rejected outright the review petitions filed by the PML-N, Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) and PPP.\n\nSubsequently, their names were excluded from the strength of CB, even though they were considered part of the bench.\n\nMeanwhile, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail partly allowed the review petitions and maintained his original order of giving 39 seats to PTI, but reviewed the majority judgment to the extent of 41 seats.\n\nIn his July 12 dissenting order, Justice Mandokhail had declared PTI a parliamentary party consisting of 39 members, and thus entitled to reserved seats. Therefore, the ECP should recalculate and reallocate the reserved seats amongst the political parties, including PTI, he held.\n\nThe July 12 majority judgement had asked the rest of the 41 independent candidates to file signed and notarised statements before the commission within 15 days — explaining that they contested the Feb 8 general elections as a candidate of a particular political party. Consequently, the ECP had notified them as PTI members, in light of the judgement.\n\nJustice Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who were part of the earlier majority judgement, also reviewed their positions and allowed the review petitions.\n\nHowever, they posited that since the controversy at hand could not be resolved, either by the PHC or the Supreme Court, the ECP should examine and consider afresh the nomination papers/declaration and other relevant documents of all 80 returned candidates, with regard to their affiliation, and take a decision on the allocation of reserved seats within 15 days from receiving a copy of their short order.\n\nWhat the decision means\n\n“Practically, the beleaguered PTI is no longer a parliamentary party, therefore the 77 reserved seats — including the National Assembly and the provincial assemblies — will be allocated among the parliamentary parties present in the respective assemblies, since they cannot be kept vacant,” a senior counsel explained.\n\nConsequently, the ECP will also have to recall its suspension of earlier victory notifications, which it had issued soon after the July 12 judgement.\n\nOf these 77 special seats, 22 seats will be divided amongst different political parties in the National Assembly, of which 19 seats are allocated for women and three for non-Muslims, he explained.\n\nOf the 22 vacant reserved seats in the National Assembly, 15 will be allocated to PML-N, four to PPP and three to JUI-F, which sits on the opposition benches, he said.\n\nAfter this process, the ruling coalition will achieve a two-thirds majority; in a house of 336, the magic number required to attain a two-thirds majority is 224. PML-N’s tally will rise from 110 to 125, the PPP’s strength will increase from 70 to 74, while the JUI-F will have 11 seats rather than the 8 they currently hold.\n\nAs ten judges had allowed the review petitions — seven completely and three partially — the counsel explained, those who had earlier joined the SIC could face the defection clause under Article 63A of the Constitution, if they chose to rejoin PTI after this judgement.\n\nLast-minute recusal\n\nAt the outset of Friday’s proceedings, the strength of the 11-judge CB was further reduced to ten when Justice Salahuddin Panhwar recused himself.\n\nDuring the hearing, while pointing towards senior counsel Hamid Khan, Justice Panhwar observed that he felt personally hurt with the way the counsel had argued. Since the counsel had no faith in him, he had no option but to recuse himself.\n\nWith the permission of the chair, Justice Panhwar read out an order he had written, stating that during the proceedings of the reserved seats case, all counsel — including Faisal Siddiqi for SIC and Salman Akram Raja for PTI and Kanwal Shauzab — had expressed confidence in the composition of the bench.\n\nHowever, during the previous hearing, senior counsel Hamid Khan had raised an objection targeting the inclusion of certain judges — including Justice Panhwar himself — who were appointed after the passage of the 26th Constitutional amendment.\n\nThe counsel has questioned the propriety of our participation in this bench for the adjudication of the present matter, Justice Panhwar observed.\n\n“In the light of the objection raised and in deference to the judicial propriety, irrespective of its merit or the timing of assertion, I considered it appropriate to recuse myself from further hearing of this case,” Justice Panhwar announced, adding that his recusal was not an admission for disqualification, but intended to uphold the institutional integrity and objectivity of these proceedings.\n\n“Greatly appreciate that,” replied Hamid Khan. At this, Justice Khan retorted that it was not a matter of appreciation.\n\n“This is only because of your conduct,” regr­etted Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail. The court then retired and assembled later after a considerable time.\n\nThe recusal of Justice Panhwar was also noted by the CB in its short order, saying that after he recused himself and contributed a separate note, the bench was reconstituted with all available members of the CB.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
