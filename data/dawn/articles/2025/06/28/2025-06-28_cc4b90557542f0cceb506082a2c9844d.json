  "content": "LAHORE: Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz Sharif says that those who used to say that Nawaz Sharif had been removed from the political arena are themselves stand excluded from the national political scene.\n\n“Those who would say that Nawaz Sharif is ‘minus’ from politics are now ‘minus’ themselves. No one made them ‘minus’, but their own poor performance,” she told the Punjab Assembly while thanking the lawmakers on passing the budget 2025-26 on Friday.\n\n“My sister Aleema Khan herself has stated that the founder (of PTI) has been ‘minused’. Today, it’s not us saying it, but the founder’s own sisters are talking about being ‘minused’,” she said with reference to Ms Khan’s recent statement.\n\nDuring the address, there was uproar from the PTI members who ignored Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan’s warning of dealing with those violating decorum of the House under Rule 223.\n\nIn her speech to PA, CM mentions uplift projects in S Punjab; condemns Israel attack on Iran\n\nUndeterred by the opposition’s protest, she said, “Let the opposition carry on. I acknowledge their right (to protest).”\n\nIn her speech, Maryam stated that numerous governments were formed and toppled in the name of south Punjab and false promises were made to the region. “We took practical steps instead of just making announcements and fulfilled our promises,” she added.\n\nThe chief minister announced the launch of a clean water project starting tomorrow (Saturday), stating that the largest clean drinking water project would commence from south Punjab.\n\nShe added that special attention was being paid to the development of south Punjab.\n\n“For me, every village and tehsil in Punjab is the same. The people of Punjab are being delivered their rights to their doorsteps.\n\n“My competition is not with anyone else, but with the stalwarts of my own party, whose names are Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif.”\n\nShe emphasised that they were serving the public across the province without discrimination and minority cards and farmer cards had been distributed to the public.\n\nMaryam paid tribute to the MPAs for approving the historic budget.\n\n“We have presented the most organised budget in history, worth Rs5,335bn. For the first time in history, we have given a tax-free budget,” she proclaimed.\n\n“I congratulate you, the parliamentarians, and all of Pakistan on the victory against India,” she said and extended her tribute to the armed forces and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\n\n“I condemn the Israeli attack on Iran. Pakistan is a peaceful state operating on the principles of peace. The Pakistani nation is commendable for standing with Iran.”\n\nMaryam said Punjab’s domestic debt, which has persisted for 30 years, is now almost eliminated.\n\n“Instead of imposing any new taxes, we have broadened the tax base, which has resulted in increased revenue,” she explained.\n\nShe praised the efforts of Finance Minister Mujtaba Shuja and Finance Secretary Mujahid Sher Dil, stating that both individuals had prepared the budget according to Nawaz Sharif’s agenda.\n\nShe claimed that the government expenditures had only increased by three percent, which included raises in salaries and pensions. She highlighted that Punjab had saved Rs30bn in the mines and minerals sector and lauded the revolutionary steps taken by the department.\n\nThe CM emphasized that the government was serving the public without discrimination.\n\n“In every one of my projects, every citizen from every area of Punjab has the same share as the residents of Lahore. Bhakkar, Layyah, Rajanpur, DG Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, all are included just as the people of Lahore are included,” she concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
