  "content": "France will ban smoking on beaches and in parks, public gardens and bus shelters from Sunday, the government said.\n\nThe decree, published in the official government gazette on Saturday, will also ban smoking outside libraries, swimming pools and schools, and is aimed at protecting children from passive smoking.\n\nThe decree did not mention electronic cigarettes. Violators of the ban will face a fine of €135 (Rs44,849).\n\n“Tobacco must disappear from places where there are children,” Health and Family Minister Catherine Vautrin had said in May, underscoring “the right of children to breathe pure air”.\n\nCafe terraces are excluded from the ban.\n\nSome 75,000 people are estimated to die from tobacco-related complications each year in France.\n\nAccording to a recent opinion survey, six out of 10 French people (62 per cent) favour a smoking ban in public places.",
