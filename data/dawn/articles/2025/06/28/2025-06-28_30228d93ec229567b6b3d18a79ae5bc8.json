Weather-related incidents are common during the season, but experts say climate change is increasing their frequency and severity.\n\nTwo people died while four were wounded in a roof collapse incident reported at 3:20am in the Abbas Nagar area of Lahore’s Shahdara Town, Rescue 1122 said in a statement today.\n\nIt noted that the house was single-storied and the roof was made of mud. The bodies were taken to Shahdara Hospital, where some of the injured were also taken, while others wounded were brought to Mayo Hospital.\n\nSeparately, eight children were among 12 dead while 39 others were injured in various rain-related incidents across Punjab since Wednesday, according to a PDMA report issued today.\n\nFrom Wednesday to Friday, 25 incidents were reported in various cities, which rose to 28 today, a statement by the PDMA spokesperson said.\n\nMost of the cases involved wall and roof collapses due to torrential rains, accounting for nine out of 12 lives lost during the four-day period, according to the report.\n\nIn Kasur, two children died from a roof collapsing while another two lost their lives in a wall collapse incident. One child each died in roof collapse incidents in Okara, Bahawalnagar and Faisalabad.\n\nIn Wazirabad, a wall collapsing killed a man and a child, along with injuring a woman and another minor.\n\nIn Jhelum, the PDMA report said, two men “drowned in a rainwater nullah”. A recent report detailed that a loader rickshaw fell into a storm drain on an inundated road.\n\nThe PDMA report also mentioned a lightning incident in Khanewal that took the life of a man.\n\nOther districts where casualties were reported were Mandi Bahauddin, Sahiwal, Chiniot, Multan, Sheikhupura and Nankana Sahib. Separately, a cow perished in Rahim Yar Khan after a tree fell due to a windstorm.\n\nIrfan Ali Kathia, the PDMA director general, issued directives to provide medical assistance to the injured as well as financial aid to their relatives.\n\nIn a statement, he also requested citizens to avoid non-essential travel during inclement weather conditions.\n\n“Do not live in dilapidated houses,” he advised. “Take care of the children [and] do not let them go near the rainwater drains, electric wires and poles.”\n\nMonsoon rains have commenced in Punjab and the first spell will continue till July 1, the PDMA said earlier this week, adding that rainfall with strong winds and thunderstorms are predicted in most districts of the province.\n\nPunjab is predicted to receive 25 per cent more monsoon rains this year, Kathia said on Wednesday.\n\nIn case of emergency, citizens are directed to call the PDMA helpline at 1129.",
