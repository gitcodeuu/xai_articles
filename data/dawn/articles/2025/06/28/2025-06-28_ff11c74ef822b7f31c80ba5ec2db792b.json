  "content": "QUETTA: The Balo­chistan government on Friday extended the detention of Dr Mahrang Baloch, chief organiser of the Baloch Yakjehti Commi­ttee (BYC), and four other leaders for another 15 days under Section 3 of the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO).\n\nMahrang Baloch, along with other BYC leaders — Beebow Baloch, her father Ghaffar Baloch, Sabghat Ullah Shah Jee and Bebarg Baloch — was arrested on March 22 and sent to Quetta District Jail under MPO-3.\n\nThis marks the fourth extension of their detention. After completing three months in custody, the authorities issued a fresh notification extending their imprisonment by another 15 days.\n\nSuperintendent of Que­tta District Jail Ham­eed Ullah Peechi confirmed the extension. “I have rec­eived orders from the authorities concerned about extending the detention of Dr Mahrang Baloch and others by 15 more days. They will remain in jail for 15 more days,” he said.\n\nThe BYC spokesperson strongly criticised the provincial government for the repeated extensions and termed the fresh orders illegal. He dema­nded the immediate release of all detained leaders.\n\nDr Sabhia Baloch, a BYC leader, said: “The continued detention of these leaders after three months is illegal and unconstitutional.” She accused the government of using various tactics to prolong their imprisonment and demanded their immediate release.\n\nMs Baloch and over 150 other political workers were arrested on March 22 from a sit-in camp.\n\nThe Home Department withdrew the arrest orders for the other detainees and released them. However, detention orders for Ms Baloch and the four other BYC leaders were not withdrawn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
