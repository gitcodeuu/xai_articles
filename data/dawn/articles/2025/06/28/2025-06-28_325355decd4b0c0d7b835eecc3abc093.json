  "content": "BEIJING: China on Friday confirmed details of the framework of its trade deal with the United States, saying Washington would lift “restrictive measures” while Beijing would “review and approve” items under export controls.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump on Friday abruptly cut off trade talks with Canada over its tax targeting US technology firms, calling it a “blatant attack” and saying that he would set a new tariff rate on Canadian goods within the next week.\n\nA top priority for Washington in talks with Beijing had been ensuring the supply of the rare earths essential for products including electric vehicles, hard drives and national defence equipment. The two sides agreed after talks in Geneva in May to temporarily lower steep tit-for-tat tariffs on each other’s products.\n\nChina also committed to easing some non-tariff countermeasures but US officials later accused Beijing of violating the pact and slow-walking export licence approvals for rare earths.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
