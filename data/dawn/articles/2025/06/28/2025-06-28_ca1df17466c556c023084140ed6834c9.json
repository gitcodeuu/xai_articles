It claimed that the action was a direct consequence of the BNP’s vocal stance against the illegal detention of Dr Mahrang Baloch, chief organiser of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee, and other political prisoners.\n\n“Instead of addressing the issues raised by the party, the authorities are targeting Sardar Akhtar Mengal’s entire family in retaliation,” the statement said.\n\nThe BNP also expressed outrage over the notice issued to Sardar Mengal’s wife, who has been severely ill for the past five years, terming it a disgraceful act.\n\nThe party reaffirmed its commitment to a principled political struggle, stating that it had always advocated for a national democratic movement — whether under military rule or civilian governments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
