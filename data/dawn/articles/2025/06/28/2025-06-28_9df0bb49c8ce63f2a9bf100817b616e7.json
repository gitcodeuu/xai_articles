I signed the letter on June 11, days before the Iran-Israel war began. The prime minister’s approval was obviously part of the process.”\n\nMr Dar referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s remarks at a June 4 event at the US Embassy, where he reportedly called Trump “a man of peace”.\n\nThe nomination has stirred controversy within Pakistan, with many questioning the rationale behind the move.\n\nIndian ceasefire claims\n\nResponding to Indian officials’ statements that claimed Pakistan had sought a ceasefire, FM Dar dismissed the assertions and reiterated Islamabad’s position that dialogue must be based on equality.\n\n“We didn’t ask anyone for a ceasefire, nor would we ask anyone for dialogue,” he said.\n\n“If India wants talks, we are ready. But we are a dignified nation, we won’t beg. Pakistan is prepared to talk on all outstanding issues, including Kashmir and terrorism, at any venue, but in a respectful manner. The ball is in their court. It takes two to tango.”\n\nHis remarks directly challenge New Delhi’s narrative and reaffirm Pakistan’s readiness for dialogue grounded in mutual respect and national dignity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 28th, 2025",
