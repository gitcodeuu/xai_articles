They should have waited. Salman Akram Raja had informed us that, according to his information, the budget would be passed on June 27,” she said.\n\nAleema questioned why the KP government had not waited and discussed the budget with Imran Khan. She said the budget’s passage could have been delayed by two weeks and alleged that the KP government must be hiding something.\n\nWhen asked why Imran Khan had not issued a strong statement against Israel, she said her brother’s message was for unity. “However, we don’t know what may happen tomorrow; Iran and the US might strike a deal. Those who are polishing boots want Imran Khan to speak out so they can complain (by saying that he is against the interest of Pakistan).”\n\nAleema added that Imran Khan was fully aware of the Iran-Israel situation and had predicted the conflict would not last long, as talks would inevitably resume due to the prevailing geopolitical situation.\n\nMeanwhile, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan appeared unaware that the KP Assembly had already passed the budget. Speaking to journalists, he said he believed the budget would be passed after one week but was informed on the spot that it had already been approved.\n\nHowever, he maintained that if Imran Khan directed it, the KP government and all party legislators would resign immediately.\n\nReaction to LHC decision\n\nPTI expressed strong disappointment over the LHC’s decision to deny bail to Imran Khan in the May 9 cases.\n\nIn a statement, the party said that despite months of proceedings, no credible evidence had been presented in these “politically motivated” cases.\n\n“Today’s ruling amounts to a blatant miscarriage of justice,” the statement read, alleging that “politically controlled” courts continued to deliver verdicts while failing to uphold the principles of justice.\n\nThe party claimed that it remained resilient despite enduring extreme repression over the past three years. “We will continue to fight our legal battles in the courts while simultaneously preparing to launch a peaceful protest movement to demand justice,” it said.\n\nAhmad Fraz Khan in Lahore also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 25th, 2025",
