GHF has denied responsibility for deaths near its aid points.\n\nOn Monday, more than a dozen human rights organisations called on the organisation to cease its operations, warning of possible complicity in war crimes.\n\nCeasefire calls\n\nAfter Israel agreed to a ceasefire with Iran on Tuesday after a 12-day war, Netayahu faced renewed calls to agree a ceasefire with Hamas after more than 20 months of war in Gaza.\n\n“And now Gaza. It’s time to finish it there too. Bring back the hostages, end the war,” opposition leader Yair Lapid of the centre-right Yesh Atid party wrote on X.\n\nNetanyahu said on Sunday that Israel’s war against Iran was “contributing to the successes in Gaza, but it will still take a bit more time”.\n\nIsrael’s retaliatory military campaign since October 2023 has killed at least 56,077 Palestinians, also mostly civilians, according to the Gaza health ministry. The United Nations considers its figures reliable.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 25th, 2025",
