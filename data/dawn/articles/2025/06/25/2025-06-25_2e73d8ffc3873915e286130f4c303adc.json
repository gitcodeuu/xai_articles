  "content": "QUETTA: The Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco) announced on Tuesday electricity supply from Iran to Pakistan’s Makran division was restored after a two-day outage plunged the region in darkness amid soaring temperatures.\n\nPower was fully restored to all three districts at 1am on Tuesday through the 132-KV Pishin-Mand and Polan-Jiwani transmission lines, according to Qesco.\n\nElectricity has now returned across the Makran Division, with regular supply restored to grid stations in Mand, Tump, Turbat, Hoshab, Panjgur, Jiwani, Gwadar Door, Gwadar Deep Sea Port, New Gwadar International Airport, Pasni and Ormara.\n\nThe power utility said the electricity was suspended on Sunday at around 2:30pm, plunging the entire Makran Division and districts of Gwadar, Kech and Panjgur, into darkness\n\n“Power suspension caused difficulties for people in 50C temperature which persisted throughout the last week,” a spokesman for Qesco said.\n\nThe company responded by connecting affected grid stations to the national grid to maintain electricity supply during the outage, the spokesman added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 25th, 2025",
