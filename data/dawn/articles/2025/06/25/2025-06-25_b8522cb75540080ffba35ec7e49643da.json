  "content": "CHITRAL: Police took into protective custody the owner of a girls’ hostel after a chat between him and a woman went viral on social media.\n\nAn official told this scribe that police would start inquiry to ascertain facts leading to initiation of criminal case against him under relevant laws once his identity was confirmed.\n\nIn the clip of the chat, the man identified as Zuhaib, a resident of Singur village of Lower Chitral, was trying to influence the woman to meet him by showing himself as deputy superintendent of police, working undercover for special branch.\n\nHe said that the act of accusing was tantamount to online harassment of a woman, as he was trying to entice her by showing his influence, authority and wealth as well as status in society.\n\nThe official said that the barrage of condemnation in social media showed resentment in the society, and it was imperative to take him into protective custody under Section 107 of the Code of Criminal Procedure so that no one could harm him.\n\nHe said that as the accused disowned the Facebook account to be fake, which someone had hatched to trap him into difficulties, so its authenticity would be determined to proceed further.\n\nMeanwhile, traders in Chitral will observe shutter-down strike on Wednesday against the decision of the federal government to impose income tax on them.\n\nThe vice-president of interim cabinet of Tujjar Union Chitral, Haroon Rashid, told journalists in Chitral Press Club here on Tuesday that they had decided to go on strike to show their unity throughout Malakand division.\n\nHe said that traders of Chitral would go to any extent to resist the unjustified tax, which would affect people. He said that people were already affected by soaring prices of food items.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 25th, 2025",
