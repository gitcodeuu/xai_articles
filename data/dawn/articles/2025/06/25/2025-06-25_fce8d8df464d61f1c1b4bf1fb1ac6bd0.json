Through sharing the NHS’s cutting-edge clinical best practices and helping to develop staff, this agreement will directly help to save lives.”\n\nJane Marriott visited the hospital construction site along with the UK Trade Envoy to Pakistan, Mohammad Yasin MP, who is on a three-day visit to Pakistan. Following a tour of the site, she met with Johannes Kedzierski, CEO of Novacare, and Faraz Minai, Director of Novacare, among other representatives from the facility.\n\nJane Marriott stated that this partnership strengthens the UK’s global healthcare leadership by exporting NHS clinical standards and expertise. It includes opportunities for Novacare clinicians to observe multidisciplinary team meetings, receive second opinions from UK specialists, and undergo training aligned with NHS protocols, she added.\n\nComplex cases may also be referred to Imperial’s private facilities in London, enhancing revenue for UK healthcare institutions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 25th, 2025",
