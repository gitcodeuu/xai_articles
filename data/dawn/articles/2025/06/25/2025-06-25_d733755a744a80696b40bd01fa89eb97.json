He urged locals to expedite the voluntary surrender of illegal arms, warning that failure to do so would result in confiscation by the state.\n\nThe chief secretary said sustainable and lasting peace in any region was only possible through the sincerity, hard work, and mutual cooperation of people.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of inclusive dialogue and trust-building among all stakeholders to ensure enduring peace.\n\nShahab Shah said that community leaders were united in their message of solidarity, adding that such sentiments of patriotism must also be inculcated in youth. “We must remind our younger generation that we are all Muslims and brothers; there is no room for division among us,” he said.\n\nShahab Shah warned of threats aimed at destabilising the country from within.\n\nExpressing optimism for the upcoming holy month, he hoped that, as in the past, both Sunni and Shia communities would observe Muharram with mutual respect and brotherhood.\n\n“God willing, not only Muharram but every coming month will pass peacefully, and our enemies will never succeed in their malicious designs,” he concluded.\n\nThe Sunni and Shia elders assured the participants that they would abide by the agreements reached between them to restore calm and avoid fighting in Kurram.\n\nMeanwhile, a control room was established for the monitoring of central mourners’ processions through CCTV cameras in Kohat.\n\nMohammad Waqas, the tehsil in-charge of the municipal service, while briefing tehsil municipal officer Mohammad Shoeb on Tuesday, said the control room would also provide backup power supply, wireless connectivity, and other technical facilities.\n\nThe control room has been set up by TMA.\n\nTALENT HUNT: Lahore Qalandars cricket team announced on Tuesday to launch a talent hunt in the Kohat division from July.\n\nRana Atif, chief executive officer and owner of Lahore Qalandars, visited the new cricket ground prepared by the army at the regional sports complex, where he along with players inspected the preparations for organising the talent hunt programme.\n\nHe visited the district on the special invitation of regional sports officer.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 25th, 2025",
