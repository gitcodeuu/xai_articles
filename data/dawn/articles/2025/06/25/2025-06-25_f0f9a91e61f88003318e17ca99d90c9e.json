  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has ap­­proved $194 million in financing for two major development projects in Balochistan to expand educational access and streng­then water security, while the Asian Deve­lopment Bank (ADB) signed a $350m loan agreement for a landmark initiative to boost women’s financial inclusion in Pakistan.\n\nThe World Bank’s $100m “Getting Results: Access and Delivery of Quality Education Services in Balochistan” (GRADES-Balochistan) project aims to benefit around 250,000 students by increasing enrolment and improving literacy and numeracy in early childhood and primary education.\n\nKey components include expanding school readiness through quality early childhood education, introducing double shifts and public-private partnerships to increase school capacity, ensuring safe transport, constructing climate-resilient classrooms, and implementing a comprehensive teacher development programme.\n\nThe project will support 5,000 teachers through continuous professional development and provide scholarships to 400 female students to pursue pre-service teacher education, encouraging them to become future mentors and role models.\n\n“The GRADES-Balochistan project aims to reduce learning poverty in the province, while the Balochistan Water Security and Productivity Improvement Project will help address water security challenges and enh­ance climate resilience,” said Najy Benhas­sine, WB Country Director for Pakistan. “The bank remains committed to supporting Balochistan through strategic investments in infrastructure and human development.”\n\nWB and ADB pledge a combined $544m for transformative projects in Balochistan\n\nProject Team Leader Inga Afanasieva noted that the initiative addresses critical gaps in access to and quality of early education while strengthening disaster resilience and environmental sustainability.\n\nThe second World Bank-funded initiative, the Balochistan Water Security and Produc­tivity Improvement Project (BWSPIP), will receive $94m to improve livelihoods for smal­l­holder and tenant farmers in the Nari, Talli, and Lehri river basins of the Kachi Plain, and enhance water supply services in Quetta. The project is expected to benefit 500,000 people through improved access to basic water supply and an additional 80,000 through climate-resilient infrastructure.\n\nKey interventions include enhanced flood protection, increased access to water for productive use, and improvements in water supply service delivery. The initiative seeks to boost agricultural productivity and economic stability by improving irrigation infrastructure.\n\n“The project supports the implementation of Pakistan’s Resilient Recovery Framework and aims to benefit farming communities and Quetta residents. It also includes a strong focus on empowering women in community-level water management,” said Carolina Dominguez Torres, the project’s Task Team Leader.\n\nFinancial inclusion\n\nSeparately, ADB signed a $350m loan agreement comprising a $300m policy-ba­sed loan and a $50m financial intermediary loan under the Women Inclusive Fina­nce Sector Development Programme. The agr­e­e­­ment was signed by Economic Affairs Division Additional Secretary Sabina Qur­eshi and Head of ADB’s Project Admi­nis­tration Unit Dinesh Raj Shiwakoti. The State Bank of Pakistan signed the project agreement for the financial intermediary loan.\n\nThe subprogramme-II builds on earlier policy reforms introduced under the first phase and targets four key areas: enabling policy and regulatory frameworks for women’s financial inclusion, increasing the availability of finance for women, supporting women entrepreneurs, and promoting equitable and inclusive practices in the financial sector. ADB said the programme is expected to make a significant contribution to Pakistan’s efforts for inclusive, resilient, and sustainable development.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 25th, 2025",
