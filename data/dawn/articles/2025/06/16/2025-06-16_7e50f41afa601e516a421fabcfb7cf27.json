  "content": "LONDON: A riveting World Test Championship final between Australia and South Africa went a long way to boost the sagging credentials of the five-day game, but the format of the competition is in need of a revamp, according to many of the games top observers.\n\nSouth Africa beat Austr­alia by five wickets at lunch on the fourth day of a fluctuating contest at Lord’s in which the bowlers dominated the opening two days. A total of 24 wickets were taken, but the tables were turned as wickets turned benign and the batsmen changed the course of the match.\n\nIt was classic Test cricket, as good as the excitement from any limited overs contest, but the overall WTC is a bewildering competition, devoid of uniformity and an unbalanced points system.\n\nThere was much criticism of how South Africa managed to reach the final without playing either Australia and England in the two-year qualifying period.\n\n“It’s very hard for the average cricket fan to understand who’s the best team in the world and how exactly the top two teams make it to the final,” said former England captain Michael Vaughan, now a television pundit.\n\nThe two finalists are deci­ded by a table of Test results, with points awar­ded for wins and draws. The pair with the highest percentage of points available to them advance to the final, which in 2027 could again be at Lord’s or in India, according to International Cricket Council officials.\n\nBut there was a major discrepancy in South Africa playing only 12 Tests compared to 19 for Australia and India, and even more by England (22). “I can’t remember if I’ve ever even given any real time to be specifically thinking about the World Test Championship to be honest because it’s utterly confusing,” added England captain Ben Stokes.\n\nCountries are free to dec­i­de how many Tests they want to play, and in South Africa’s case, there is much less of an appetite for Test cricket because they lose money.\n\nIn the next cycle, which starts on Tuesday when Bangladesh begin a two-Test series in Sri Lanka, the new champions will play 14 Tests, this time including three-Test series against each of Australia and England but only two against India.\n\nFive-Test series are now only the preserve of contests between Australia, England, and India.\n\n“The fixture list is uneven; not everyone plays everyone else, and some have an easier ride than others,” wrote Michael Atherton last week. “Everyone knows the WTC in its present guise is flawed, and that solutions, with so many competing interests, are fiendishly difficult,” added the former England skipper.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 16th, 2025",
