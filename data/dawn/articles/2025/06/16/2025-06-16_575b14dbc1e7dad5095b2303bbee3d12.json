  "content": "KUALA LUMPUR: Pakistan and Malaysia played out a pulsating 3-3 draw in their opening fixture of the FIH Hockey Nations Cup at the National Stadium on Sunday, with the Green Shirts relinquishing a lead late in the match.\n\nPakistan began the contest on a strong note, taking a 2-0 lead in the first quarter courtesy of goals from Nadeem Ahmad and Rehman Abdul. The visitors dominated the proceedings for much of the first three quarters, effectively denying the hosts any significant scoring opportunities.\n\nMalaysia, however, mounted a spirited comeback in the final quarter. Goals from Saari Fitri and Azrai Abu Kamal brought the hosts back into the contest, narrowing the deficit to a single goal. Pakistan briefly restored their advantage when Rana Waheed Ashraf found the net, taking the score to 3-2. But Malaysia responded once again, with Holan Syed equalising late in the game to ensure the points were shared.\n\nPlaced in Pool B, Pakistan will now face Japan on Monday, followed by a crucial fixture against New Zealand on June 18.\n\nThe FIH Nations Cup features eight teams split across two pools, with Pool A comprising France, Korea, South Africa, and Wales, and Pool B including Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, and Pakistan. The top sides from each pool will advance to the semi-finals scheduled for June 20, with the final and third-place play-off set to take place on June 21.\n\nThe Nations Cup serves as a qualification pathway to the elite FIH Hockey Pro League, with the winner earning promotion to the 2025–26 season.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 16th, 2025",
