  "content": "LONDON: A rare oil painting of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi, which is believed to have been damaged by a Hindu nationalist activist, is to be auctioned in London in July.\n\nGandhi, one of the most influential figures in India’s history, led a non-violent movement against British rule and inspired similar resistance campaigns across the world. He is the subject of tens of thousands of artworks, books and films.\n\nBut a 1931 painting by British-American artist Clare Leighton is believed to be the only oil portrait he sat for, according to the painter’s family and Bonhams, where it will be auctioned online from July 7 to 15.\n\n“Not only is this a rare work by Clare Leighton, who is mainly known for her wood engravings, it is also thought to be the only oil painting of Mahatma Gandhi which he sat for,” said Rhyanon Demery, Bonhams Head of Sale for Travel and Exploration. The painting is a “likely hidden treasure”, Caspar Leighton, the artist’s great-nephew, said. Going under the hammer for the first time next month, the painting is estimated to sell for between 50,000 and 70,000 ($68,000 and $95,000).\n\nClare Leighton met Gandhi in 1931, when he was in London for talks with the British government on India’s political future. She was part of London’s left-wing artistic circles and was introduced to Gandhi by her partner, journalist Henry Noel Brailsford.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 16th, 2025",
