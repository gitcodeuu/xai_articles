We appreciate the successful operations of the security forces against Indian-sponsored terrorists and their backers.”\n\nStating that every Pakistani stands against terrorism, Naqvi wrote, “With the support of the nation, we will completely wipe out Indian-sponsored terrorism.”\n\nEarlier this month, 14 “Indian-sponsored” terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with security forces in North Waziristan, the military’s media wing said.\n\nISPR Director General Lt Gen Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry had also accused India of activating its “assets” to inte­nsify terrorist attacks in Pakistan, presenting “irr­e­futable evidence” of Ind­ian state-sponsored terrorism, directed by the Ind­ian military personnel.\n\n“Post-Pahalgam, because of the designs of terrorism that they have, they tasked all their assets, the terrorists operating in Balochistan, and we have credible intelligence for that, the Fitna-al-Khawarij and the independent terrorist cells … to increase their activity,” he had said.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an uptick in terror activities, especially in KP and Balochistan, after the TTP ended its ceasefire with the government in November 2022.",
