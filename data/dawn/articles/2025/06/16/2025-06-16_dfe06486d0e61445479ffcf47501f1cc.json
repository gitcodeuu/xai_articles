Two forecast a 100 basis-point (bps) cut and one predicted a 50bps cut.\n\nOn inflation, the MPC noted that the recent uptick in May to 3.5pc year-on-year was in line with its expectation, whereas core inflation declined “marginally”.\n\nThe headline inflation had hit an all-time low of 0.3pc YoY after declining for several months from around 40pc in May 2023.\n\nThe MPC said inflation was expected to “trend up and stabilise” in the target range. The SBP expects average inflation to range between 5.5pc and 7.5pc for the current fiscal year, which ends this month.\n\n“This outlook, however, remains subject to multiple risks emanating from potential supply-chain disruptions from regional geopolitical conflicts, volatility in oil and other commodity prices, and the timing and magnitude of domestic energy price adjustments,” the committee added.\n\nIt noted that economic growth was picking up gradually and was projected to gain further traction next year on the back of earlier rate cuts. However, the MPC cautioned about “some potential risks to the external sector amidst the sustained widening in the trade deficit and weak financial inflows”.\n\nIt observed that some of the proposed FY26 budgetary measures may further widen the trade deficit by increasing imports, adding that the decision to maintain the interest rate was “appropriate to sustain the macroeconomic and price stability”.\n\nThe MPC termed the “timely realisation of planned foreign inflows, achievement of the targeted fiscal consolidation and the implementation of structural reforms as essential to maintain macroeconomic stability and achieve sustainable economic growth”.\n\n“The decision to hold rates was not surprising given the uncertain geopolitical outlook with oil prices spiking around 15pc,” said Mustafa Pasha, executive director at Karachi-based Lakson Investments.\n\n“Additionally, it gives the SBP time to assess the impact of the budget and upcoming gas/electricity tariff revisions on inflation and the external account.”\n\nNoting the key developments since its last meeting in May, the MPC said the real GDP growth for FY25 was provisionally reported at 2.7pc.\n\n“Despite a substantial widening in the trade deficit, the current account remained broadly balanced in April,” it highlighted, also mentioning the increase in the SBP foreign exchange reserves to $11.7 billion as of June 6, owing to the $1 billion tranche by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\n“Third, the revised budget estimates indicate the primary balance surplus at 2.2pc of GDP in FY25, up from 0.9pc last year,” the MPC said, adding that the government was targeting a primary surplus of 2.4pc of the GDP for next year.\n\nThe SBP decision also comes on the heels of Pakistan’s contractionary budget, in which it cut total spending by 7pc and set a GDP target of 4.2pc for fiscal year 2025-26.\n\nThe government said the $350 billion economy is stabilising under a $7bn International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, though analysts remain wary of external and fiscal pressures.",
