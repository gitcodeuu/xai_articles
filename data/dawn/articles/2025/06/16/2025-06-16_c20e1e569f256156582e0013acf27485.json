Everyone thought it would be mild and theatrical,” said Mohammad Jamal, 27, a resident of Gaza City.\n\n“Watching rockets fall without the stupid Iron Dome being able to stop them is a joy, and seeing buildings collapsing and fires everywhere reminds me of the destruction the occupation brought on Gaza, yet I can’t even begin to compare,” he told Reuters via a chat app.\n\nThe Iron Dome is part of Israel’s multi-layered missile defence system that tackles the kind of short-range rockets and mortars fired by Hamas fighters from Gaza.\n\nTahrir, a 34-year-old mother of four, said their house was destroyed in the Shejaia suburb, east of Gaza City, in the early weeks of the conflict in 2023, and her family has since been displaced several times.\n\n“Finally, many Israelis felt what we have felt for 20 months, fear, loss of faith, and displacement,” she said.\n\n“I hope that this time, they will press their government to end the war in Gaza because all of what is happening with Iran is part of the wider Gaza war.”\n\nThe latest fatalities in Israel, reported by Israel’s national emergency services, raised its death toll to 23 since Friday. Israeli attacks in Iran have killed at least 224 people since Friday, Iran’s health ministry has said.\n\nWith Israel saying its operation could last weeks, fears have grown of a regional conflagration dragging in outside powers.\n\n“I was never a fan of Iran, I still don’t like them because of their intervention in Gaza and other Arab countries, but seeing them retaliate for real, not a play like in previous times, made me happy, despite all the sadness around me,” said Amr Salah, 29.\n\n“It is nothing compared to what Israel did to Gaza, but at least a taste of it. It is maybe time to end all of this, in Gaza too,” he added.\n\nThe conflict in Gaza erupted 20 months ago after Hamas-led fighters stormed into southern Israel, taking 251 hostages and killing 1,200 people, most of them civilians, according to Israeli tallies, on October 7, 2023.\n\nIsrael’s military campaign since has killed nearly 55,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to health authorities in Gaza, and flattened much of the densely populated strip, which is home to more than 2 million people. Most of the population is displaced and malnutrition is widespread.\n\nDespite efforts by the United States, Egypt and Qatar to restore a ceasefire in Gaza, neither Israel nor Hamas has shown willingness to back down on core demands, with each side blaming the other for the failure to reach a deal.\n\nHamas-led factions praised the retaliatory strikes by Iran.\n\n“Scenes of Iranian missiles striking the strongholds and hideouts of the Zionists carry with them a sense of pride, dignity, and honour that shatters Zionist arrogance and dominance,” said a statement issued in the name of the Hamas-led “Factions of Resistance”.",
