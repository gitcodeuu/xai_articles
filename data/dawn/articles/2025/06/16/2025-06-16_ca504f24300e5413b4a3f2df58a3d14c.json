Substantial funds are likely to be allocated to key sectors, including education, law and order, health, infrastructure, and agriculture.\n\nMore than Rs160bn is expected to go to the education sector, over Rs100bn to law and order, and around Rs80bn to health services.\n\nSalaries of government employees in Balochistan are also likely to be increased in line with federal government’s announcement. Provincial employees have been protesting in recent weeks to demand pay raise and other benefits.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 16th, 2025",
