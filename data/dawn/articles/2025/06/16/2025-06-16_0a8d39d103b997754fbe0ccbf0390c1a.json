The rest were killed in separate airstrikes in the southern Gaza Strip, they added.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from the Israeli military.\n\nThe GHF began distributing food packages in Gaza at the end of May after Israel partially lifted a near three-month total blockade. Scores of Palestinians have been killed in near-daily mass shootings trying to reach the food.\n\nThe UN rejects the Israeli-backed new distribution system as inadequate, dangerous and a violation of humanitarian impartiality principles.\n\nThe Gaza health ministry said in a statement on Saturday that at least 300 people have so far been killed, and more than 2,600 wounded, near aid distribution sites since the GHF began operations in Gaza.\n\n“These are not humanitarian aid, these are traps for the poor and the hungry under the watch of occupation planes,” said Munir Al-Bursh, Director-General of the health ministry.\n\nIsraeli soldier killed\n\nThe Israeli soldier killed in Gaza a day earlier was identified as Noam Shemesh, 21, from Jerusalem.\n\nIn a statement, the military said he “… fell during combat in the southern Gaza Strip”.\n\nAbout 430 soldiers have been killed since Israel’s ground operation in Gaza began on October 27, 2023.\n\nProtests in Europe\n\nTens of thousands of people dressed in red marched through the streets of The Hague on Sunday to demand more action from the Dutch government against what they termed a “genocide” in Gaza.\n\nThe protest followed similar pro-Palestine demonstrations across major European cities, including Brussels, Paris, Zurich and Madrid, throughout the week.\n\nRights groups such as Amnesty International and Oxfam organised the demonstration through the city to the International Court of Justice, creating a so-called “red line”.\n\nWith many waving Palestinian flags and some chanting “Stop the Genocide”, the demonstrators turned a central park in the city into a sea of red on a sunny afternoon.\n\nOne of the organising groups, Oxfam Novib, estimated 150,000 people participated in the march. Organisers urged the Dutch government — which collapsed on June 3 after a far-right party pulled out of a fragile coalition — to do more to rein in Israel for its military offensive on the Palestinian territory.\n\nDemonstrators on Sunday called for the caretaker government to speak out against what they said were ongoing violations of international law by Israel.\n\n“More than 150,000 people here dressed in red —and a clear majority of the Dutch population — just want concrete sanctions to stop the genocide in Gaza,” said Michiel Servaes, director of Oxfam Novib.\n\n“We demand action now from our government.”\n\nDodo Van Der Sluis, a 67-year-old pensioner, told AFP: “It has to stop.\n\nEnough is enough. I can’t take it anymore.“ “I’m here because I think it’s maybe the only thing you can do now as a Dutch citizen, but it’s something you have to do,” she added.\n\nIn response to the protests, Dutch Prime Minister Dick Schoof said the goal is to end the war in Gaza as soon as possible.\n\n“To all those people in The Hague I say: we see you and we hear you.” “In the end, our goal is the same: to end the suffering in Gaza as soon as possible,” he wrote in a post on X.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 16th, 2025",
