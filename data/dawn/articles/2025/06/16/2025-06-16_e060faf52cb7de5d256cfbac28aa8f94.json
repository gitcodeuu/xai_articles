  "content": "Following World War II, the world entered an era of profound change. The global order underwent a dramatic shift as the United States and the Soviet Union emerged as rival superpowers, while many nations worked to recover from the devastation of the war. Against this backdrop, the need for economic collaboration, diplomatic engagement, and collective security became increasingly evident. The world’s advanced economies, particularly in the West, sought to ensure that the post-war order would foster peace and prevent another global conflict.\n\nThe advanced industrial economies recognised the importance of coming together to stabilise markets, promote economic growth, and coordinate monetary policies to prevent further global disruptions.\n\nThe G7 emerged from this collective vision to address issues affecting the world’s leading industrial economies. Originally formed as a group of six major industrialised nations — the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom — it later expanded in 1975 with the addition of Japan. This expansion was a response to global economic challenges, particularly the 1973 oil crisis, which was accompanied by economic instability, soaring oil prices, and inflation that deeply affected the global economy.\n\nOver time, the group’s focus expanded beyond purely economic issues. As geopolitical tensions evolved, the G7’s agenda grew to encompass a broader range of global challenges. The G7 has served as a platform where the leaders of these nations can discuss key issues that affect the global economy, security, and the future of international governance. It became especially significant in times of crisis — whether addressing the collapse of financial markets or global issues such as climate change, terrorism, and pandemics.\n\nThe G7 has served as a platform where leaders can discuss key issues that affect the global economy, security and the future of international governance\n\nHowever, in the current context, the G7 does not involve some of the major global powers and, therefore, fails to represent the full range of global needs. As the global landscape has shifted, the influence of the G7 has been challenged by the rise of new economic powerhouses and geopolitical players. The growing influence of emerging economies particularly China, India, Brazil, and others from the Global South have reshaped the global order.\n\nWhile the G7 continues to serve as a powerful forum for advanced economies, it faces increasing criticism from the Global South for its failure to fully understand and adapt to the evolving global needs and shifting geopolitical and economic realities. What was once a vital forum for addressing global economic challenges has increasingly become out of step with the world’s current dynamics.\n\nThe Global South, which represents a significant portion of the world’s population and economic output, is often excluded from the G7’s discussions. This exclusion undermines the group’s ability to address issues that affect the entire global community. The G7’s reluctance to evolve in response to these shifts has led to its portrayal as a club for wealthy, industrialised nations, rather than a truly representative body capable of tackling the pressing global challenges of today.\n\nThe group’s failure to include voices from the developing world means that many global issues such as inequality, climate change, and international security are often addressed in a way that reflects the interests of the few, rather than the many. Decisions made by the G7 are frequently seen as benefiting only a select group of countries. For instance, trade agreements often reflect the interests of G7 members while leaving developing nations with less favourable terms. Similarly, interventions in conflict zones or sanctions on certain countries are sometimes applied selectively, with geopolitical considerations influencing the consistency and fairness of these actions.\n\nThe G7’s narrow membership leaves out the perspectives of the developing world, whose voices are crucial in shaping policies that address systemic inequalities. Moreover, there is a deep sense of double standards in how the G7 approaches international governance. This creates a perception that the G7, in many ways, acts in self-interest and applies a set of rules that is inconsistent or unfair. By sidelining these perspectives, decisions often favour the economic and political interests of wealthier nations, exacerbating global disparities.\n\nThis type of governance where the interests of the few dominate the decisions made for the many only deepens global divisions and undermines efforts to build a fairer, more just international system. The G7’s failure to recognise its limitations in representing the world’s diverse needs is a major reason why its decisions increasingly face criticism.\n\nWithout a more inclusive approach that integrates the perspectives of developing countries and ensures fairness and equity, the G7 risks beco­ming irrelevant as the world moves toward more inclusive, multipolar frameworks for addressing global challenges.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 16th, 2025",
