  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Since seeing thousands of comments justifying the recent murder of a teenage TikTok star in Pakistan, Sunaina Bukhari is considering abandoning her 88,000 followers.\n\n“In my family, it wasn’t an accepted profession at all, but I’d managed to convince them, and even ended up setting up my own business,” she said.\n\nThen last week, Sana Yousaf was shot dead outside her house in the capital Islamabad by a man whose advances she had repeatedly rejected, police said.\n\nNews of the murder led to an outpouring of comments under her final post — her 17th birthday celebration where she blew out the candles on a cake.\n\nCompared to 58pc of men, only 30pc of women in Pakistan own smartphone — the largest gap in the world, as per 2025’s Mobile Gender Gap Report\n\nIn between condolence messages, some blamed her for her own death: “You reap what you sow” or “it’s deserved, she was tarnishing Islam”.\n\nYousaf had racked up more than a million followers on social media, where she shared her favourite cafes, skincare products and traditional shalwar kameez outfits.\n\nTikTok is wildly popular in Pakistan, in part because of its accessibility to a population with low literacy levels. On it, women have found both audience and income, rare in a country where fewer than a quarter of the women participate in the formal economy.\n\nPakistani telecommunications authorities have repeatedly blocked or threatened to block the app over what it calls “immoral behaviour”, amid backlash against LGBTQ and sexual content.\n\nAfter Yousaf’s murder, Bukhari, 28, said her family no longer backs her involvement in the industry.\n\n“I’m the first influencer in my family, and maybe the last,” she said.\n\n‘Fear of being judged’\n\nOnly 30 per cent of women in Pakistan own a smartphone compared to twice as many men (58pc), the largest gap in the world, according to the Mobile Gender Gap Report of 2025.\n\n“Friends and family often discourage them from using social media for fear of being judged,” said a statement from the Digital Rights Foundation (DRF).\n\nIn Balochistan, where tribal law governs many rural areas, a man confessed to orchestrating the murder of his 14-year-old daughter earlier this year over TikTok videos that he said compromised her honour.\n\nIn October, police in Karachi, in the south, announced the arrest of a man who had killed four women relatives over “indecent” TikTok videos.\n\nViolence against women is pervasive in Pakistan, according to the country’s Human Rights Commi­ssion, and cases of women being attacked after rejecting men are not uncommon.\n\n“This isn’t one crazy man, this is a culture,” said Kanwal Ahmed, who leads a closed Facebook group of 300,000 women to share advice.\n\n“Every woman in Pakistan knows this fear. Whether she’s on TikTok or has a private Instagram with 50 followers, men show up. In her DMs. In her comments. On her street,” she wrote in a post.\n\nIn the fifth-most populous country in the world, where 60pc of the population is under the age of 30, the director of digital rights organisation Bolo Bhi, Usama Khilji, says “many women don’t post their profile picture, but a flower, an object, very rarely their face”.\n\n“The misogyny and the patriarchy that is prevalent in this society is reflected on the online spaces,” he added.\n\nA 22-year-old man was arrested over Yousaf’s murder and is due to appear in court next week.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 16th, 2025",
