Pakistan, in particular, was projected to see a sharp rise in population exposure to extreme heat in the coming years. “We must integrate heat adaptation into urban planning, public health systems, and disaster preparedness,” he urged.\n\nKey measures proposed included the establishment of community cooling centers, early warning systems, promotion of cool roofing and green urban spaces, restoration of public parks and forests, and increased access to clean drinking water and emergency medical services. The Ministry was also working with provincial governments, development partners, and civil society to scale up climate-resilient initiatives.\n\nDirector General of the Ministry, Mohammad Asif Sahibzada, urged citizens to follow public health advisories and protect at-risk groups such as children, outdoor workers, and the elderly by protecting them from being exposed peak heat during peak hours and keep them hydrated. He stressed that expanding early warning systems to remote regions and integrating heat-resilient infrastructure into national planning were vital steps for future preparedness.\n\n“Adaptation is no longer just a policy recommendation - it is a survival strategy,” Sahibzada said adding, “We must act now, together, to shield lives and livelihoods from the escalating impacts of extreme heat.”\n\nThe Met Office has forecast heatwave during the three days of Eidul Azha till June 12 during which the daytime temperatures are likely to remain 5 to 7 degrees Celsius above normal in central and upper Punjab, Islamabad,Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan from June 7 to 12.\n\nIn upper and centralSindh, southern Punjab and parts of Balochistan, daytime temperatures are likely to remain 04 to 06°C above normal from June 7 to 12.\n\nThe Met Office has issued advisory urging citizens to avoid exposure to direct sunlight\n\nDust storms and gusty winds are also expected over the plains due to excessive heat, the advisory said.\n\nThe PMD has advised citizens, especially children, women and older people, to take precautionary measures — avoid exposure to direct sunlight during the daytime and stay hydrated.\n\nFarmers have been advised to manage their crop activities as per the forecast.\n\nThe PMD has warned the authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any mishap due to severe heatwave conditions.\n\nThe heatwave advisory was issued a day after PMD officials informed a high-level meeting that temperatures were already above normal in Gilgit-Baltis­tan and were forecast to remain so in the days ahead, resulting in above-normal snowmelt.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 7th, 2025",
