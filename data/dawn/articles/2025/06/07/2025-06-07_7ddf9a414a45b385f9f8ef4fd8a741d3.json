His story is a powerful reminder of the life-saving impact of organ donation,” an official said.\n\nHe said MTRA, along with all participating institutions, including IKD, PICO/HMC, and PKLI deeply honor the decision of Jawad’s family and salute their strength during an unimaginably difficult time, said doctors.\n\nThe official said the family’s selfless act would continue to inspire others to recognise the profound importance of organ donation in saving lives.\n\nWhen contacted, Dr Yasir Murad, executive officer of Murad Eye Bank at PICO HMC, said it was the first-ever corneal retrieval that was transplanted to two patients.\n\nHe said the corneal team of Murad Eye Bank transplanted both corneas to most deserving patients on the waiting list.\n\n“A historic milestone was achieved with a hope that more and more people will follow the footsteps of Noor Dad khan by donating the organs which are life-saving for so many patients in waiting for these organs,” he said.\n\nHe said the Murad Eye Bank, established in 2018 in the memory of Prof Murad, pioneer of ophthalmology in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has transplanted 105 corneas free of cost to patients. All the corneas were sent as donations through the courtesy of APPNA and by the efforts of Dr Fawad Zaffar from the US.\n\n“The Murad Eye Bank has so far transplanted 510 corneas, all donated by APPNA,” Dr Yasir said, urging people to follow the example of Khan to restore people’s vision.\n\nHe said Jawad’s legacy should light the way for a more compassionate and life-affirming society.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 7th, 2025",
