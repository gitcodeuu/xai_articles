  "content": "TEHRAN: Iran warned European powers on Friday against backing a draft resolution at the International Atomic Energy Agency next week accusing Tehran of non-compliance, calling it a “strategic mistake”.\n\n“Instead of engaging in good faith, the E3 is opting for malign action against Iran at the IAEA board of governors,” Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on X, referring to Britain, France and Germany.\n\n“Mark my words as Europe ponders another major strategic mistake: Iran will react strongly against any violation of its rights.”\n\nThe warning from Iran’s top diplomat comes as the three European governments prepare to join Washington in backing a censure resolution at next week’s board meeting.\n\nThe resolution would accuse Iran of failing to meet its nuclear obligations and carries the threat of referral to the UN Security Council if Tehran “does not show goodwill”.\n\nAraghchi said Tehran had demonstrated “years of good cooperation with the IAEA — resulting in a resolution which shut down malign claims of a ‘possible military dimension’ (PMD) to Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme”.\n\n“My country is once again accused of non-compliance,” he added, blaming “shoddy and politicised reporting”.\n\nThe criticism follows a quarterly report from the IAEA last week which cited a “general lack of cooperation” from Iran and raised concerns over undeclared nuclear material.\n\nTehran rejected the report as politically motivated and based on “forged documents” it said had been provided by Israel.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 7th, 2025",
