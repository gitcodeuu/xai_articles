A few of the restraining orders issued in these cases incapacitated Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to collect taxes for over two decades.\n\nThe division bench of Justice Mohammad Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas decided an overwhelming majority of 173 of tax cases involving Rs424bn. Another bench comprising Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan cleared 94 cases in which over Rs150bn recoveries were stalled.\n\nA bench comprising acting IHC Chief Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas lifted the stay orders and decided three petitions that had in 2023 restrained the FBR to collect Rs36bn.\n\nJudicial policy body had advised high courts to constitute special benches for disposal of tax-related cases\n\nA two-member division bench comprising Justice Mohammad Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas decided 125 cases related to Income Tax References, Sales Tax References and Foreign Exchange Regulations Act.\n\nThe government’s recoverable Rs290.51bn were stuck in 125 cases related to ITR. 36 STR cases involves recovery of Rs131.55bn while Rs3.16bn were recoverable in 12 cases related to FERA.\n\nIn February, CJP Yahya Afridi met with PM Shehbaz Sharif to discuss the agenda of the upcoming meeting of the National Judicial Policy Making Committee.
