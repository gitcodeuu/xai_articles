  "content": "The United Kingdom and India on Saturday discussed expanding their “counter-terrorism” collaboration following recent fighting between the latter and Pakistan, Britain’s foreign minister told Reuters after meeting Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\n\nBritish FM David Lammy is the highest-profile Western official to have visited both New Delhi and Islamabad since the two agreed to a ceasefire last month after their worst fighting in nearly three decades.\n\nThe latest tensions began in April after the killing of 26 men in Indian-occupied Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on “terrorists” it alleged were backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denied. India then attacked what it claimed was “terrorist infrastructure” in Pakistan, leading to escalation from both sides until a May 10 ceasefire.\n\n“We want the situation to be maintained, but of course we recognise fragility, particularly in the backdrop of terrorism, terrorism designed to destabilise India,” Lammy said in an interview at the residence of the British high commissioner in New Delhi.\n\n“We are keen to continue to work with our Indian partners on counter-terrorism measures.”\n\nHe said he discussed the next steps with both Modi and Indian FM S. Jaishankar, but gave no specifics.\n\nLast year, India and Britain discussed combatting the financing of terrorism, cooperation between law enforcement and judicial bodies and information sharing.\n\nLammy said he also discussed boosting trade between the world’s fifth and sixth largest economies. The countries concluded talks for a free trade deal early last month.\n\n“I know that Prime Minister Keir Starmer is very much looking forward to coming to India very soon to sign the free trade agreement,” Lammy said. “There is so much that our two nations can continue to do together.”",
