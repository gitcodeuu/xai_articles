  "content": "KARACHI: The city administration has imposed an eight-day ban on visiting five unguarded beaches due to high tides and rough sea conditions.\n\nThe ban will remain in place till June 13 and it is applied to the Kannup, Sunerah, Mubarak Village, Turtle and Dua Chowk beaches.\n\nOfficial sources said there was no restriction on people to visit other city beaches, including Sandspit, Hawkesbay, Paradise Point and Seaview, as these beaches were guarded by lifeguards and law enforcers.\n\nCommissioner Syed Hasan Naqvi imposed the ban under Section 144 of the criminal procedure code on the request of the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC).\n\nThe order authorised the SHOs concerned to register FIRs under Section 188 of the Pakistan Penal Code against violators of the ban.\n\nThe officials said that a ban on swimming at other beaches might be imposed in view of the monsoon season, when there was comparatively high tide there.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 7th, 2025",
