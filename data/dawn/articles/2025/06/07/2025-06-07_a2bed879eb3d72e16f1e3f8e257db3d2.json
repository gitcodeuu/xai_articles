ICE agents have intensified such operations in and around American immigration courts in recent weeks.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security revoked regulations that limited agents’ access to protected areas such as courts after Trump returned to office in January.\n\nOne of the men arrested in New York was Joaquin Rosario, a 34-year-old Dominican who arrived in the US a year ago, registered as he came in and who had his first immigration hearing on Friday, his relative Julian Rosario said.\n\n“He was at ease. He did not think anything was going to happen,” the relative said, adding that Rosario was so unworried he had not brought his lawyer with him.\n\nThe other detainee appeared to be Asian. He arrived accompanied only by one of many immigration advocacy group volunteers who walk immigrants to and from the courtroom. The volunteers screamed out as the agents arrested the two men, but it did nothing to halt the raid.\n\nHuman rights groups are outraged by such operations, arguing that they sap trust in the courts and make immigrants wary of showing up for appointments as they try to gain US residency.\n\n“They’re illegal abductions,” said Karen Ortiz, a court employee who was demonstrating on Friday against the sudden arrests of migrants.\n\n“We need to sound the alarm and show the public how serious this is and one way we can do that is actually physically putting ourselves between a masked ICE agent and someone they’re trying to detain and send away,” she told AFP.\n\nTrump has dramatically tested the limits of executive power to crack down on foreigners without papers since he returned to office, arguing that the US is being invaded by criminals and other undesirables.",
