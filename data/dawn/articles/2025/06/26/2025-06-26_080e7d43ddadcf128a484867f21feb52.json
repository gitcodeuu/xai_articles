Though they lack capability, we won’t let them control even an inch of our land,” he asserted, thanking the federal government and the President for giving Rs10bn to strengthen the Counter-Terrorism Depart­ment.\n\nAdditionally, 100 police stations will get proper boundary walls and improvements in prosecution processes are underway.\n\nFor economic development, Mr Bugti envisioned Chagai as an investment hub, particularly from Saudi Arabia and China, with plans for a solar grid and an industrial estate.\n\nA major dam project in Washuk is also planned.\n\nTo boost exports, meat packaging plants will be set up in Chaman, Gwadar, Turbat, and Chagai. “We don’t just want to give young people loader vehicles. We want to create entrepreneurs,” he said.\n\nThe government will also distribute pink scooters to women in collaboration with the National Bank, and a youth policy has been finalised.\n\nThe provincial health card system will be revamped, introducing health insurance for government employees.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
