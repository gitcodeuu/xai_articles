The government is committed to improving federations and encouraging healthy sports culture for a strong and fit nation.”\n\nArshad received the highest cash award of Rs2million for winning gold at the Asian Athletics Championships as the PSB disbursed a total of Rs8.2 million among 36 athletes. Arshad’s coach Salman Butt also received Rs600,000.\n\nCueist Ahsan Ramzan was awarded Rs500,000 for his bronze in the Under-21 Asian Snooker Championship with Mohammad Asif receiving a similar prize for his triumph at the SAARC Snooker Championship. Mohammad Naseem Akhtar, who took bronze at the same event, received Rs100,000.\n\nTeenager Abdal Mohammad Khan was the big winner among table tennis players, receiving Rs250,000 for his silver medal in the singles event of the Under-15 South Asian Youth Championship.\n\nHe and Zunaira Khan got Rs187,500 each for winning silver in the mixed doubles at the same event. Abdal and his team-mates Noor Khan, Taha Bilal, Abu Huraira, Attaul Manan, and Moosa Asif also received Rs75,000 each for the boys doubles and team events.\n\nSpecial Olympics athletes were also honoured for their performances in the World Winter Games. Abdul Saboor Ahmad received Rs250,000 for a gold medal in the 400m Snowshoeing event and Rs100,000 for a bronze in the 200m event.\n\nMuhammad Afaq Khan and Muhammad Moazzam Iqbal were awarded Rs250,000 each for gold in their respective events, while Muneeb-ur-Rehman was honored with Rs 250,000 for each of his gold medals in 50m and 100m Cross Country Skiing.\n\nRelay team members Abdul Saboor, Afaq, Moazzam, and Ali Raza were each given Rs.150,000, alongside Minahil, Raveena Qurban, Iqra Akram, Shah Galoon Hayat, and Tabassum for their team contributions.\n\nThe PSB also distributed Rs63.9million to 22 sports federations under annual and special grant categories with the Athletics Federation of Pakistan receiving the biggest chunk amounting to Rs10million.\n\nThe National Rifle Association of Pakistan was given Rs7million, which comprised Rs2million in annual grant.
