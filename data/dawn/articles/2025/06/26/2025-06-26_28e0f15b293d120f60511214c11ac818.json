However, he lamented that no action was taken on the letter.\n\nAdvocate Khosa stated that “we only want the judge’s blessings that he should refer the matter to the CJP”. But Justice Shah reiterated that the senior counsel should approach the Registrar’s Office or the CJP directly.\n\nLater, speaking to the media outside the court premises, Mr Gandapur regretted that democracy had ended in this court and that, with the passage of the 26th Amendment to the Constitution, the writ of the judiciary had also been eroded in the country.\n\nHe alleged that an attempt was being made to harm the PTI founder, stressing that lies were being disseminated through social media to earn money.\n\nPetition filed\n\nMr Gandapur also filed a petition in the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution, seeking a declaration against the federal government, Punjab’s chief secretary and the Adiala Jail superintendent for denying regular meetings with Imran Khan. The petition argues that such denial violates Articles 9 and 10A of the Constitution, which guarantee the right to life and a fair trial.\n\nThe petition argues that the court should direct the respondents to ensure compliance with any court order regarding visitation rights, adding that Mr Gandapur’s role as the chief minister necessitates consultation with the founding chairman, especially for the Budget 2025-26, for effective governance and policymaking.\n\nIt said that the restriction on access undermined the democratic rights of PTI members and supporters, which it claimed represented over one-fourth of Pakistan’s population, adding that the failure of prior petitions in the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on the same subject underscored the urgency and necessity of the apex court’s intervention.\n\nThe petition explained that Imran Khan had expressed a desire to consult relevant senior officials of the KP government, including chief minister’s adviser Muzammil Aslam, Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub and former KP finance minister Taimur Jhagra, to discuss critical matters before the provincial budget’s passage.\n\nIt noted that previous court orders, including those from the IHC, had permitted limited weekly meetings; however, the practical implementation by the jail superintendent remained inconsistent, necessitating notice from the Supreme Court.\n\nThe petition argued that several cases had been filed in the IHC seeking permission for the petitioner to meet Imran Khan, but these efforts have borne no fruit.\n\nIt added that the matter involved a question of public importance regarding the enforcement of fundamental rights, as the continued detention and restricted access to the PTI founder affected the democratic process and stability.\n\nThe petition contended that the KP chief minister, as a key political ally, seeks regular and unimpeded access to Imran Khan for consultation on matters of provincial governance, party policy and ongoing legal proceedings affecting PTI leadership.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
