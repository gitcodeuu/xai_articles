The court adjourned the hearing after summoning the present accused again, citing the absence of the main accused.\n\nTwo cases have been registered against the PTI founder and other leaders at Ramna Police Station in connection with the May 9 incidents.\n\nThe court had earlier sought guidance from the Ministry of Law on whether to allow the former prime minister to be produced in court or to hold the proceedings inside the jail.\n\nIn a separate case registered at Karachi Company Police Station over a protest on Nov 26, the court indicted three accused and summoned prosecution witnesses for the next hearing scheduled on July 13.\n\nPTI leaders Bushra Bibi and Ali Amin Gandapur are also named in this case, though the police have yet to submit the challan against them. Bushra Bibi currently on interim bail.\n\nMeanwhile, progress has been re­­­ported in the Islamabad High Co­­urt in appeals and bail applications filed by the PTI founder and Bushra Bibi in the £190 million reference.\n\nThe National Account­ab­i­li­­ty Bure­­au (NAB) has appointed Ad­­vocate Javed Arshad as a special prosecutor to represent the bureau in the case.\n\nThe appointment was confirmed through a notification issued by Acting Prosecutor General Muhammad Akbar Tarar with the approval of the NAB chairman.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
