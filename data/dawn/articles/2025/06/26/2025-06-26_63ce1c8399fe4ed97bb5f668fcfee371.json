  "content": "Brussels: Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said on Wednesday that the US government will no longer contribute to Gavi, accusing the group that helps buy vaccines for the world’s poorest children of ignoring safety, without providing evidence.\n\nIn a video statement shown at a Gavi fundraising event in Brussels, Kennedy — a long-time vaccine sceptic — also accused the Global Alliance for Vaccines of making questionable recommendations around Covid-19 vaccines, and raised concerns about the DTPw (diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis) vaccine.\n\nGavi said in a statement that safety was key, and that it acts in line with World Health Organisation recommen­dations. It has full confidence in the DTPw vaccine, which has contributed to halving child mortality in the countries it supports since 2000, the statement continued.\n\n“I call on Gavi today to re-earn the public trust, and to justify the $8 billion that America has provided in funding since 2001,” Kennedy said in the video, saying Gavi should consider all available science. “Until that happens, the United States won’t contribute more,” he said. The details of the video were first reported by Politico.\n\nGavi said it “fully concurs with the Secretary for Health and Human Services on the need to consider all available science, and remains committed to continuing an evidence-based and scientific approach to its work and investment decisions, as it always has done.”\n\nGavi leaders, donors and countries it works with are in Brussels for the organisation’s pledging summit, where the alliance aims to raise $9 billion for its work from 2026-30.\n\nKennedy said in the video that he admired much of Gavi’s work, particularly its efforts to make medicines affordable worldwide. “Unfortunately, in its zeal to promote universal vaccination, it has neglected the key issue of vaccine safety,” he added. “Gavi’s utmost concern is the health and safety of children,” the group’s statement responded.\n\nThe Trump administration has previously indicated that it planned to cut its funding for Gavi, representing around $300 million annually, as part of a wider pullback from international aid.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
