  "content": "QUETTA: In a bid to boost mineral trade with China, the Balochistan Board of Investment and Trade (BBoIT) has initiated efforts to attract Chinese investment in local mineral processing and expand copper ore exports through enhanced cooperation.\n\nA virtual meeting held between the BBoIT, the Consul General of Pakistan in Shanghai, and the Trade Development Authority of Pakistan (TDAP) explored avenues to deepen bilateral engagement in mineral development, particularly in shifting from raw material exports to value-added processing within Balochistan.\n\nBBoIT CEO Abdul Kabeer Khan Zarkoon, Consul General Shahzad Ahmed Khan, and TDAP representative Muhammad Yousaf attended the meeting.\n\nMr Zarkoon highlighted that Balochistan, home to vast reserves of copper, gold, and other strategic minerals, holds the potential to become a regional hub for mineral processing. He reaffirmed the provincial government’s commitment to developing local infrastructure, generating employment, and securing returns for foreign investors.\n\nHe added that the BBoIT is prepared to provide full facilitation, policy support, and regulatory safeguards to international firms interested in investing in the province’s mineral value chain.\n\nPakistan exports nearly $1.2 billion worth of copper ore to China annually.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
