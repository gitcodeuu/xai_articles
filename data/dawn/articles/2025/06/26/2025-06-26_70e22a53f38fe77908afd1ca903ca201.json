  "content": "QUETTA: UNDP officials have said that the UN agency’s ‘Rule of Law Programme’ is delivering swift and affordable justice to the people of Balochistan through its Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanism.\n\nThe programme aims to strengthen the rule of law and ensure equal access to justice, particularly for women and marginalised groups. It focuses on enhancing the capacity of justice and security institutions, improving access to justice for all, and promoting peace and stability.\n\nShehzada Ahmed, Country Head of the Rule of Law Programme of UNDP, said the ADR has helped resolve 95 per cent of the 186 registered civil, family, criminal and other cases so far. She said this during a meeting with Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry President Mohammad Ayub Mariani and others. The meeting focused on enhancing cooperation and introducing ADR as a key tool for resolving business-related disputes in the province.\n\nMr Mariani said that the rule of law and provision of timely and affordable justice are essential pillars of good governance.\n\nHe noted that such initiatives not only strengthen public confidence but also play a crucial role in the socio-economic development of the province and the country at large.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
