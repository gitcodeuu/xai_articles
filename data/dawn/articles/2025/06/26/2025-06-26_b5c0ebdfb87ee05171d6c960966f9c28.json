The training will include classroom lectures, field driving and computerised education.”\n\nAccording to the statement, Sindh IGP Ghulam Nabi Memon visited the school, along with other senior police officers and the principal of the school.\n\nHe was briefed by the deputy inspector general of police (DIG) Driving License about the school building, classrooms, computer lab and other facilities, the statement said.\n\nIGP Memon was quoted as saying, “The first driving school has been established in Karachi under a pilot project.”\n\nHe said that driving training schools will also be established in Hyderabad, Larkana and Khairpur, adding, “The driving training school will also be upgraded this year with the facility of driving simulators.”\n\nHe added that the administrative and teaching matters will be under the control of the DIG training branch.\n\nThe statement further quoted him as saying, “We have started a training project to promote safe driving because we value the lives and property of citizens.”\n\nCalling road safety the police’s “top priority”, he said, “Learning to drive properly as a responsible citizen is a necessity for every individual, and Sindh Police stands with them in this responsibility.”\n\n“We want every driver to not only be safe on the road but also to be a guarantor of the safety of others,” he said. “The only way to prevent accidents is to have trained drivers. We are working towards that goal.”",
