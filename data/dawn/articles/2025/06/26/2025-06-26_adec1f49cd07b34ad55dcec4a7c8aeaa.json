He said that drainage cess had been abolished to mitigate the impact of adverse weather and reduced cultivation as major crop yields such as wheat, sugarcane, maize and rice had seen significant decline this year.\n\nThe CM said that various revenue charges, such as mutation fee, certified copies, sales certificate, solvency certificate, heirship certificate and flat annual tax for commercial vehicles had been decreased by 50pc.\n\nThe yearly tax for commercial vehicles has been slashed to just Rs1,000, providing major relief to transporters and logistics operators.\n\nPublic benefit\n\nThe CM said that the stamp duty on third-party motor insurance was now just Rs50, while two-wheeler vehicles were exempted from the mandatory insurance requirement from FY 2025-26.\n\nEntertainment duty as per the Sindh Finance Bill on the entire sector, including cinemas, drama theatres, art councils, water parks and cultural events was abolished.\n\nChief Minister Murad Ali Shah said that these sweeping relief measures by the provincial government signalled a pro-growth, pro-people fiscal policy, prioritising economic stimulation, reduction of regressive taxes and empowerment of key sectors such as agriculture, transport and small enterprises.\n\n“The 2025-26 budget is a crucial step toward resilience, equity and sustainable development in the province,” he concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
