The mobile phones, believed to be containing sensitive digital material, have been sent for a forensic analysis, he said.\n\n“The suspects had made videos and captured pictures of the country’s sensitive installations, which they used to send to RAW using specialised software,” the SIU officer claimed.\n\nAccording to him, the suspects admitted that they used to meet officers of RAW and Indian Border Security Force in border areas.\n\nThey received large sums of cash, liquor and valuable gifts from Indian agencies’ personnel, the SSP said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
