Israel described him as “the most senior military commander” and “the closest figure to Iranian Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei”.\n\nThe confirmation of his death came a day after a US-announced ceasefire ended 12 days of open conflict between Israel and Iran.\n\nShadmani died just days after he took over the role from Gholam Ali Rashid, who was killed in the first days of Israel’s attacks.\n\nOn June 13, Israel launched a major bombing campaign targeting Iranian nuclear facilities and senior military figures.\n\nIran will hold on Saturday state funerals for senior military commanders, including Shadmani, and top scientists killed during the war with Israel.\n\nIsraeli commandos on the ground\n\nThe head of Israel’s military said on Wednesday that Israeli commandos had operated secretly inside Iran during the countries’ 12-day war.\n\nChief of staff Eyal Zamir in a televised address hailed the “coordination and tactical deception carried out by our air force and ground commandos”, who “operated in secret, deep in enemy territory, and allowed us complete operational freedom”.\n\nThe head of Israel’s Mossad intelligence service thanked the US Central Intelligence Agency for its help in “joint” operations during the recent 12-day war with Iran.\n\nIn a video distributed to Israeli media on the second day of a fragile ceasefire between the warring countries, Mossad chief David Barnea thanked his agents for their work making Israel “safer, more powerful and better prepared for the future”.\n\n“I also wish to express my gratitude and appreciation to our key partner — the CIA — for the joint action and the operations that were successfully carried out, as well as to its director, who supported the Mossad in making the right decisions,” added the spy chief, who rarely offers public remarks.\n\nIsrael’s attacks on Iran starting June 13 targeted not only the Islamic republic’s missile and nuclear facilities, but also senior military figures and atomic scientists.\n\nAnalysts say the strikes underlined how Israel’s intelligence services had succeeded in penetrating the Iranian state, although the extent of the purported help provided by the CIA is unknown.\n\nThe US military helped shoot down Iranian missiles fired at Israel, and US President Donald Trump ultimately joined Israel’s campaign with strikes using massive bunker-busting bombs on Iranian nuclear facilities.\n\n“We will continue to keep our eyes wide open on all of Iran’s undertakings — projects we know in depth — and we will be there, as we always have been,” Barnea said in his video statement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, June 26th, 2025",
