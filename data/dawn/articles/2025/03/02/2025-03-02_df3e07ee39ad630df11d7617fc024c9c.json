  "content": "LAHORE: The Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) Lahore has introduced an innovative system for issuing online roll number slips to students for the annual 2025 matriculation examination.\n\nThis is the first time the BISE has implemented an online system aimed at enhancing the transparency and efficiency of the examination process.\n\nThe initiative, launched under the special instructions of BISE Lahore Task Force Committee for Boards Chairman Mazamil Mahmood, Higher Education Department Secretary Dr Farrukh Naveed, and Lahore Commissioner/Chairman Board Zaid bin Maqsood, includes the addition of QR codes to the roll number slips. The move was achieved through the efforts of BISE Secretary Rizwan Nazir.\n\n“The introduction of QR codes on roll number slips is a major step forward in ensuring the authenticity of the examination process,” said Secretary Nazir. “This technological advancement will help us track and verify candidates, reducing the chances of fraudulent activities.”\n\nLaunches automated set-up to deploy invigilators\n\nBy scanning the QR code, candidates can easily access their personal data and roll number slip on the BISE website. This user-friendly approach not only streamlines the process for students but also ensures that the data is accurate and up-to-date.\n\nController of Examinations Zahid Mian highlighted the importance of this initiative in promoting transparency. “We are committed to making the 2025 matric exams as transparent and fair as possible,” he stated. “The implementation of this online system is a testament to our dedication to providing a secure and efficient examination experience for all candidates.”\n\nBISE spokesperson Tahir Javed said the students and parents have expressed their appreciation for the board’s efforts to modernise the examination system as the examination date approaches.\n\nHe said that the online roll number slip system is expected to serve as a model for other educational boards in Pakistan, paving the way for further technological advancements in the country’s education sector.\n\nEarlier, the BISE launched an automated system to deploy examination staff, including superintendents, deputy superintendents and invigilators. The system will automate the allotment of duties in the examination.\n\nThe 2025 matric exams will be facilitated by 920 examination centres, an increase of 52 centres compared to previous years, accommodating 568,854 students from both Science and General groups. In an effort to maintain the integrity of the examination process, blacklisted, retired, and private staff will not be appointed. The system is designed to manage teachers’ data zone-wise and leverages a comprehensive data bank of 100,000 teachers.\n\nIt autonomously allocates duties to examination staff without user intervention, reducing the risk of favouritism and cheating, prevalent in the manual appointment process. Several checks have been introduced to maintain integrity.\n\nThe system will verify that teachers are not marked in restricted categories and will ensure that teachers are not assigned to centres where their students are taking exams.\n\nThe key benefits of the system include preventing individuals from using personal influence to secure appointments at preferred centres, reducing the risk of examination malpractice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
