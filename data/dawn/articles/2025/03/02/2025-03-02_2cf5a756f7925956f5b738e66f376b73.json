He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to peaceful dialogue and highlighted the importance of Parlia­mentary Friendship Groups in strengthening international cooperation.\n\nMr Sadiq also expressed deep concern over the violence in Gaza and condemned Israel’s actions as war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nIn October 2024, the 45th Annual Forum of Parliamentarians brought together over 46 foreign parliamentarians to Pakistan.\n\nChaired by Speaker Sadiq, the event emphasised the critical role of parliamentarians in addressing global challenges, including human rights violations, access to clean water, and conflict resolution.\n\nOther notable dignitaries who arrived at the Parliament House last year were Sheikh Dr Salah Mohammad Al-Badeer, the imam of Masjid Al-Nabawi (Peace Be Upon Him) and renowned Islamic scholar Dr Zakir Naik.\n\nPakistan also hosted the first-ever Commonwealth Women Parliamen­tar­ians (CWP) Workshop on Legislative Drafting, attended by women legislators from across the Commonwealth.\n\nThe event served as a platform for discussions on best practices, legal frameworks, and strategies to enhance laws promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment, the report added.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this report stated that the National Assembly had fired 220 staffers to save money. This report has been updated for clarity after the NA Secretariat stated that the abolished posts had been lying vacant for decades, and that no staffers were fired.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
