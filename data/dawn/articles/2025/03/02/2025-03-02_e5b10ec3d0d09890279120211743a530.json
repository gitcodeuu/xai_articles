  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Saturday adopted a joint resolution demanding immediate reduction in fares of airlines from Quetta to other cities of the country which have recently been “increased manifold without justification”.\n\nMir Sadiq Umrani, the provincial minister for irrigation, moved the resolution in the house on behalf of other movers soon after the session started.\n\nThe session was presided over by Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai.\n\nMr Umrani, while presenting the joint resolution, said that Balochistan is a poor province and most of its people travel by air to Karachi and other cities of the country for treatment and business due to frequent blockades of Quetta-Karachi and other highways of Balochistan.\n\nOpposition leader Mir Younas Aziz Zehri demanded the federal government to order PIA to increase its flights for Quetta and other cities of Balochistan.\n\nMr Zehri said that private airlines should also be asked to operate flights for Quetta because they have suspended their operations to the city.\n\nDr Malik Baloch, the president of National Party, said that airlines operating flights for Turbat were charging Rs60,000 as fare for one-way ticket.\n\nHe also demanded that night flight operations in Balochistan should be stopped.\n\nThe house unanimously adopted the resolution.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
