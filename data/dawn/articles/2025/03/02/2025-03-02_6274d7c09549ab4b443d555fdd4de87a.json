People’s children are being crushed,” he deplored and added that he had asked the DIG traffic to take action himself; otherwise, he would step in personally.\n\nSays complaint cell to be established at Governor House to combat drug menace\n\nHe also announced that a complaint cell would be established at Governor House to combat drug-related issues in the province.\n\nReferring to the Mustafa Amir murder case, he emphasised that this was a critical opportunity to eliminate the menace of drugs.\n\nHe urged parents to monitor their children closely and educate them on avoiding substances handed to them by others. Additionally, he announced plans to write to schools and colleges, requesting mandatory drug testing for teachers and students.\n\nMoreover, he also announced that homeless individuals would be allotted plots through a lottery system.\n\nHe announced that the doors of Governor House would remain open to the public during “Ittehad Ramazan” programme, with one million people expected to break their fast at the venue.\n\nThe governor encouraged people to register for the programme and extended the invitation to religious minorities as well.\n\nHe said that the largest-ever Ittihad Ramazan stage in history was being prepared at Governor House, with additional Iftar gatherings planned across the city. “The event will also feature Iftar, dinner, Taraweeh prayers, Naat recitals, qawwali sessions etc,” he added.\n\nTo a question, he clarified that no public funds were involved in Governor Initiatives, saying that the welfare projects were funded through personal contributions and the support of his friends.\n\nRegarding security concerns, he stated that he would write to the home minister and home secretary, emphasising that no individual should be allowed to move with an unregistered security entourage.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
