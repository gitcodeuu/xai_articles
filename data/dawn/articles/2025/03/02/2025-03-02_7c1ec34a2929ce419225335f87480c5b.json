New Zealand will take on Group B winners South Africa in Lahore on Wednesday.\n\nAustralia and South Africa had to travel to Dubai from Pakistan despite not knowing if they would be playing there, as India were told ahead of the tournament that they would play the first semi-final if they qualified, no matter where they finished in the group.\n\nSouth Africa will now have to fly back to Pakistan ahead of their meeting with New Zealand.\n\nChakravarthy took his first ODI five-wicket haul in just his second match as India bowled out New Zealand for 205 in 45.3 overs despite a valiant 81 by Kane Williamson.\n\nNew Zealand pace bowler Matt Henry stood out with figures of 5-42 from his eight overs.\n\nThe Black Caps lost Rachin Ravindra early as Axar Patel took a superb catch to dismiss the opener for six.\n\nChakravarthy cut short Will Young’s innings on 22 when he bowled him with a googly.\n\nIn between the two wickets, Williamson hit Jadeja for a boundary to raise his 47th ODI half-century but India kept taking wickets.\n\nWilliamson stood firm but could not find a long-term partner as Daryl Mitchell and Tom Latham were dismissed for 17 and 14, respectively. He survived two dropped catches on 17 and 68 in his 120-ball knock before he finally fell, stumped off Patel.\n\nIndia’s spinners dominated in helpful conditions, as Kuldeep Yadav sent back Mitchell and Ravindra Jadeja trapped Latham lbw.\n\nThe Black Caps struck early in the first innings, sending Indian top order batters Virat Kohli, Rohit Sharma and Shubman Gill all back to the dugout with the score at just 30 after seven overs.\n\nAn airborne Phillips clung on to a fast-travelling ball at backward point to dimiss Kohli for 11 off Henry. Kohli was left standing in disbelief before trudging off the ground to stunned silence.\n\nAnother stunning catch, this time by Williamson, who flung himself to his left at backward point to make a one-handed grab close to the ground, dismissed Jadeja for 16 off Henry.\n\nShreyas Iyer’s 79 and a late 45 by Hardik Pandya steered India to 249-9 after being invited to bat first. Pandya struck four fours and two sixes in his run-a-ball innings to give India a total which proved to be enough.\n\nEarlier, New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner won the toss and elected to field against India. Both teams came into the match in Dubai unbeaten.\n\nThe match was Virat Kohli’s 300th one-day international after the Indian batting great hit form with a century in the team’s previous win over arch-rivals Pakistan.\n\nIrrespective of the placing and opponent, India will play the first semi-final in Dubai on Tuesday after they refused to travel to hosts Pakistan because of political tensions.\n\nNew Zealand will leave for Lahore after the match, with the second semi-final to be played at the Gaddafi Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nThe Black Caps made one change after their win over Bangladesh, with Devon Conway making way for Daryl Mitchell. India also made one change, with spinner Varun Chakravarthy coming in for pace bowler Harshit Rana.\n\nSouth Africa and Australia are the top two teams from Group B. The outcome of India’s refusal to play Champions Trophy matches in Pakistan for Australia and South Africa is that they will not know until the final group game is completed on Sunday night whether they will face the Indians in Dubai on Tuesday or New Zealand in Lahore on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Africa will join Australia to wait in Dubai but one squad is destined to make the four-hour return journey back to Pakistan depending on whether India or New Zealand win on Sunday and top Group A.\n\nTeams\n\nIndia: Rohit Sharma (capt), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Hardik Pandya, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy.\n\nNew Zealand: Will Young, Rachin Ravindra, Kane Williamson, Daryl Mitchell, Tom Latham (wk), Glenn Phillips, Michael Bracewell, Mitchell Santner (capt), Matt Henry, Kyle Jamieson, Will O’Rourke.\n\nUmpires: Michael Gough (ENG), Richard Illingworth (ENG) TV Umpire: Adrian Holdstock (RSA) Match Referee: David Boon (AUS)\n\nAdditional input from Reuters",
