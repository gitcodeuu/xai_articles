  "content": "HYDERABAD: Senior Sindh Minister for Information Sharjeel Inam Memon has said that Pakistan Peoples Party’s leadership has made it clear time and again that no new canals will be built on Indus River, still some parties are trying to launch agitation over the issue, though they are free to exercise their democratic right to protest.\n\nSome parties were trying to form an alliance to launch a movement against the canals but the activity would prove to be an exercise in futility as PPP would not allow construction of canals, he said.\n\nAs long as PPP existed it would not allow construction of any canal on the Indus in the same manner as it had succeeded to put an end to Kalabagh Dam project in past, given new NFC Award and granted provincial autonomy, he said.\n\nThe minister was speaking at a ceremony for the distribution of solar systems among 100 deserving people, in the first phase, in his constituency, Tandojam, on Saturday. The systems were given under the Benazir Bhutto Income Support Programme and the ceremony was organised by Sindh Energy Department.\n\nSays PPP would not allow new canals\n\nThe minister urged people not to be misled by propaganda as some people were trying to deceive them. Nowadays, he said, some parties were trying to form an alliance to launch a movement on the pretext of protest against the canals but such a movement would be an exercise in futility as PPP would not allow construction of canals.\n\nHe congratulated energy minister on fulfilling his promise of providing solar systems to people and said similar events had already been organised in Sukkur and Shaheed Benazirabad. In the second phase, another 250,000 households would be given solar systems by June, he said.\n\nMemon said that Bilawal deserved to become prime minister of the country. The party chairman had rendered great public services during difficult times after floods, he remained truly concerned and passed sleepless nights over the unprecedented devastation caused by heavy rainfall, which wreaked havoc in Sindh in 2022, he said.\n\nHe said that the chairman made sure that relief reached all flood victims. Under his leadership, 100 new houses would be rebuilt in every village, he said.\n\nHe believed that Bilawal would become Pakistan’s prime minister in next elections as people had always put their trust in PPP. It was why all opposition alliances had failed to defeat PPP, he said.\n\nThe energy minister said that solar systems were being provided under BISP for only Rs6,000 and in the second phase more deserving and poor households would benefit from this scheme.\n\nHe announced that a project to strengthen electricity grids would be launched under the directive of the party chairman to provide free electricity to consumers using between 100 and 300 units. The Sindh government was constructing 2.1 million homes which would be given to people with full ownership rights, he said.\n\nHyderabad Com­missioner Bilal Ahmed Memon, deputy commissioner Zain-ul-Abideen Memon, Hyder­abad deputy mayor Saghir Ahmed Qureshi, chairman town municipal corporation Hussainabad, Umair Maula Bakhsh Chandio and others attended the ceremony.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
