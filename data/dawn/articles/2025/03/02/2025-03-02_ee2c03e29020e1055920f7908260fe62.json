However, key inputs and coordination from other ministries and provinces could delay its enforcement.\n\nThe Ministry of Maritime Affairs has commenced the consultation process with all relevant stakeholders to formulate the upgraded maritime policy.\n\nOne of the key targets of the National Maritime Policy (NMP) 2025 is to harness the potential of transit trade to Central Asia. However, the coordination between the Sindh and Balochistan governments is essential as several functions related to maritime sectors were under provincial domains.\n\nSimilarly, the NMP contains key input from other ministries, including the Defence and the Defence Production and the Commerce Ministry.\n\nEmphasises holistic maritime policy to harness Central Asia’s economic potential\n\nAt a conference held on Friday, Minister for Maritime Affairs Qaiser Ahmed Shaikh emphasised the need for a fresh and holistic maritime policy to harness the potential of growing economies in Central Asia.\n\nMr Shaikh pointed out that Pakistan’s ports were currently operating at only 50 per cent of their capacity and projected that the port utilisation would increase significantly as the country’s total import-export cargo volume keeps rising.\n\n“However, we need to keep an eye on Central Asian countries as they are rapidly expanding their trade opportunities, and Pakistan should grab the opportunity as they lack their own seaports,” the minister said, adding that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif recently visited Central Asian nations to explore further business prospects.\n\nThe minister emphasised the need for ports to accommodate ships carrying up to 20,000 containers. He said Pakistan is attracting significant interest from global maritime companies and investors.\n\nMr Shaikh pointed out that the global average contribution of the maritime industry to GDP was seven per cent, and Pakistan can achieve a target of 5pc of GDP from this sector. He said the maritime sector suffered losses of billions of rupees last year, but a target to make Rs100bn in profit has been set for this year. “I am sure we will achieve it.”\n\nThe minister announced that the government has decided that 60pc of all official imports and exports will be routed through Gwadar Port. He emphasised that Gwadar Port must be upgraded with world-class facilities to establish itself as a modern, fully operational deep-sea port.\n\nThe conference was organised by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs as a platform for discussion, collaboration and seeking feedback from the relevant departments and sectors related to the maritime.\n\nThe conference brought together all government and private sector experts related to marine pollution, marine tourism, expansion of the blue economy, maritime security, shipbuilding, shipbreaking, fisheries and international cooperation.\n\nThe workshop discussed the expansion of Pakistan’s blue economy, with focus on shipbuilding, offshore renewable energy, deep-sea exploration, aquaculture and marine biotechnology.\n\nOfficials reaffirmed Pakistan’s goal of increasing its merchant fleet share by 2047 and enhancing Gwadar Port’s capacity as a regional trade hub under the CPEC and global maritime networks.\n\nExpanding marine protected areas to 30pc of Pakistan’s Exclusive Economic Zone and strengthening the National Marine Disaster Contingency Plan were also highlighted as critical measures to safeguard marine ecosystems.The development of shipyards at Gwadar and Port Qasim was recognised as a strategic initiative to strengthen Pakistan’s shipbuilding and repair industry. Experts discussed challenges to promoting such industries and outlined strategies to secure Blue Flag certification for Pak­istan’s beaches to promote eco-tourism.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
