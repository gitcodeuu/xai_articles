That was the suppression of the press in the past. And now we have this. But the right to information and freedom of speech is a fundamental right,” he said. “Peca will control the media in every way as it is still quite an unclear and vague law, which may be twisted any which way,” he said.\n\n“Peca is a crisis that the government has created for itself. Now that the parliament has passed Peca, there is only one way to reverse the damage,” he said. “The government should announce the holding of a dialogue about Peca with civil society. The suggestions, which come up in that dialogue should then be taken back to the parliament,” he said.\n\nTalking about the dangers of Peca, former Sindh High Court Bar Association president Barrister Salahuddin Ahmed said that it can block any social media platform. “A complaint against any social media platform can start an inquiry by a committee which can either cut out the offending part of the story or completely block the platform within 24 hours. There is also three-year imprisonment as a punishment as agencies can arrest you just like they arrest criminals involved in terrorism,” he explained.\n\n“Now if journalists cannot question or criticise a person who is thought to be doing something disagreeable or offensive, then what kind of journalism is this?” He asked. “It is a sword hanging over every journalist,” he said.\n\nPakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf leader Haleem Adil Sheikh said that the media should have questioned the meddling in the media when it was done the first time. “But we don’t take stands here. We wake up when it is too late, when we are pushed against the wall,” he said. Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Taha Ahmed Khan said that those questioning Peca are mostly just showing displeasure while airing their grievances. “But they should also come up with the solutions to fix the flaws in this law,” he said.\n\n“You also cannot blindly side with the wrong aspects of the media just because you belong to the media. You also need to question the wrongs within your line,” he pointed out.\n\nRepresenting the Grand Democratic Alliance, Saira Bano said that while opposing Peca, one should also think about the things which brought about the need for such a law.\n\nJamaat-i-Islami’s Muslim Pervez wondered aloud about who enjoys freedom in this country? “The history we study in schools is not the entire history or truth. And now the media is advised to keep the entire story from you,” he said.\n\nAwami National Party leader Younus Buneri said that Pakistan was created by an advocate who wanted a democracy here. “But please understand, you cannot have a democracy without freedom of speech,” he said.\n\n‘It seems there’s no democracy’\n\nNasir Mansoor of the National Trade Union Federation said that it seems that there is no democracy in the country as it seems like martial law. “All political parties have been tamed. Most of the major institutions and organisations are being run by ex-military officials. And if we question their decisions, we are thought to be inclined towards India or Bangladesh,” he said. “Meanwhile, the trade unions are struggling to survive in the ICU,” he said.\n\nKarachi Bar Association general secretary Rehman Korai reminded that over the years, lawyers and journalists have upheld rights of the people and supported movements that became national movements, and that the situation today again calls for such action from them. “Stop the injustice now or you will become a slave who submits to all kinds of injustice,” he said.\n\nRepresenting the academia, Karachi University Teachers’ Society’s Maroof Bin Rauf suggested gathering all the stakeholders to sit together and come up with a better law to combat cybercrime and fake news as these are, after all, also a problem that needs tackling, though not with a law such as Peca that can be misused.\n\nResolutions\n\nOn the occasion, the KPC passed a resolution which demanded that the government not interfere with the media along with telling political parties to question this law.\n\nIt also demanded all media houses to ensure the payment of salaries and health facilities for its employees.\n\nLastly, it promised to carry on with its fight against the unjust Peca Act.\n\nKPC President Fazil Jamili gave the vote of thanks. KPC secretary Mohammed Sohail Afzal and joint secretary Khwaja Munsif also spoke.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
