  "content": "ISLAMABAD: An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) has approved the post-arrest bail application of the accused in the hit-and-run case of Rangers personnel during the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf’s (PTI) November 26, 2024, protests in Islamabad.\n\nThe case against Hashim Abbasi was registered at Ramna police station under terrorism and other charges.\n\nThe court presided over by Judge Abual Hasanat Mohammad Zulqarnain announced its decision following the completion of arguments from both the prosecution and defence. According to the prosecution, the accused was involved in a deliberate act of violence during the PTI demonstration. However, the defence argued that the charges were politically motivated and lacked substantial evidence.\n\nDuring the hearing, Abbasi’s counsel contended that his client had no intention of harming law enforcement personnel and was wrongly implicated in the case.\n\nThe prosecution, on the other hand, maintained that his actions posed a serious threat to security and law enforcement.\n\nFollowing the deliberations, the ATC granted post-arrest bail to Abbasi, allowing his release under specific legal conditions.\n\nIt may be mentioned here that former prime minister Imran Khan and his spouse Bushra Bibi have also been named in the same case.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 2nd, 2025",
