  "content": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: Curfew in both Upper and Lower South Waziristan districts was lifted on Monday evening, and all roads were opened to traffic.\n\nDeputy commissioners of both the districts on Sunday had declared through separate notifications imposition of curfew due to security concerns and potential threats.\n\nHowever, later on Monday evening, the curfew was lifted and all roads were opened to traffic to ease people’s suffering.\n\nThe deputy commissioners said that the lifting of curfew was aimed at facilitating people’s movement.\n\nIt merits a mention here that the security situation in Lower and Upper South Waziristan has deteriorated with a rise in terrorist activities, including bombings, targeted killing, and attacks on police and security forces’ checkposts.\n\nThese incidents have raised concerns over the safety of civilians and security personnel, prompting increased security measures in the area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 18th, 2025",
