She regretted that successive governments in GB failed to take serious steps to ensure women’s rights available to them in other parts of the country.\n\nShe said that family courts had not been established in GB to give women access to justice on domestic issues and family matters.\n\nAccording to her, the draft of a law to stop early marriages has been pending since 2017. Similarly, the bill on the prohibition of domestic violence and the Women Protection Bill were pending in the assembly. She said there were no shelter homes or separate jails for women in GB.\n\nConditions is Diamer\n\nAccording to the National Commission on the Status of Women, the Diamer district of GB had the highest rate of early marriages across Pakistan.\n\nShereen Karim, a journalist, said women were deprived of their rights in many areas of GB. She said domestic violence and workplace harassment cases usually go unreported in GB.\n\nShe claimed girls’ education in the Diamer district was still banned. Women in Diamer also had no right to vote, she added.\n\n“Basic health and education rights of women are not protected in remote areas,” she said.\n\nThe representation of women in the GB Assembly and other forums was also merely symbolic, as women elected on reserved seats were decided by men, she claimed.\n\nShe claimed that workplace harassment cases in GB were not being registered.\n\nFormer GB Assembly member Amina Ansari, who was the only female candidate in GB to contest the region’s general elections, told Dawn that she had contested three elections for GB assembly from Ghanche district.\n\nThe activists lamented the cases of honour killing, which usually go unreported in the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 18th, 2025",
