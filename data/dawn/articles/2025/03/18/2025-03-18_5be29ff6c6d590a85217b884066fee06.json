  "content": "The health ministry in Gaza has said the death toll from a massive Israeli campaign launched early on Tuesday throughout the Palestinian territory had risen to “at least 413”, including children, unilaterally ending a weeks-long standoff over extending the January ceasefire.\n\n“So far, 413 martyrs have arrived in hospitals in the Gaza Strip,” a health ministry statement said, adding: “A number of victims are still under the rubble and work is underway to recover them.”\n\nMohammed Zaqut, the ministry’s head told AFP earlier today that Palestinian women and children were among those killed while “hundreds [were] wounded, dozens of them in critical condition”.\n\nGaza’s civil defence agency spokesman Mahmud Basal told AFP that Israel’s military operation was ongoing, affecting schools and camps sheltering displaced people.\n\nStrikes were reported in multiple locations, including northern Gaza, Gaza City and the Deir al-Balah, Khan Younis and Rafah in central and southern Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Israeli military, which claimed it hit dozens of targets, said the strikes would continue for as long as necessary and would extend beyond air strikes, raising the prospect that Israeli ground troops could resume fighting.\n\nThe attacks were far wider in scale than the regular series of drone strikes the Israeli military has said it has conducted against individuals or small groups of suspected fighters and follow weeks of failed efforts to agree an extension to the truce agreed on January 19.\n\nIn hospitals strained by 15 months of bombardment, piles of bodies in white plastic sheets smeared with blood could be seen stacked up as casualties were brought in.\n\nThe Palestinian Red Crescent said its teams dealt with 86 killed and 134 wounded, but others were brought to overwhelmed hospitals by private cars.\n\nOfficials from Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, Al-Aqsa Hospital in the central Gaza Strip and Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza City — which have all been extensively damaged in the onslaught — said that altogether they had received around 85 dead. Authorities also reported separately that 16 members of one family in southern Gaza’s Rafah had been killed.\n\nIn Washington, a White House spokesperson said Israel had consulted the US administration before it carried out the strikes, which the military claimed targeted mid-level Hamas commanders and leadership officials as well as infrastructure belonging to the group.\n\n“Hamas could have released hostages to extend the ceasefire but instead chose refusal and war,” White House spokesperson Brian Hughes said.\n\nIn Gaza, witnesses contacted by Reuters said Israeli tanks shelled areas in Rafah in the southern Gaza Strip, forcing many families who had returned to their areas after the ceasefire to leave their homes and head northward to Khan Younis.\n\nMuch of Gaza now lies in ruins after 15 months of fighting, which erupted on October 7, 2023 when thousands of Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israeli communities around the Gaza Strip, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli tallies, and abducting 251 hostages into Gaza.\n\nThe Israeli campaign in response has killed more than 48,000 people, according to Palestinian health authorities, and destroyed much of the housing and infrastructure in the enclave, including the hospital system. The death toll is feared to be much higher due to thousands still missing under the rubble.\n\nAfter it unleashed the wave of deadly overnight strikes, the Israeli army urged Gazans to evacuate areas near the border.\n\nIn a post on X, Israeli military spokesman Avichay Adraee issued a warning to residents “specifically in the neighbourhoods of Beit Hanoun, Khirbet Khuza’a, Abasan Al-Kabira and Al-Jadida”.\n\n“These designated areas are considered dangerous combat zones… For your own safety, you must evacuate immediately to the known shelters in western Gaza City and those in Khan Younis,” the post said.\n\nA Hamas official told AFP that the group was “working with mediators to curb the aggression”.\n\n“Hamas adhered to the ceasefire agreement and implemented it precisely, but the Israeli occupation reneged on its commitment and reversed it by resuming aggression and war,” the official told AFP.\n\nHe added that “Hamas and the resistance factions are in constant session to assess the situation and working with mediators to curb the aggression”. So far, Hamas has not responded to the Israeli strikes.\n\nHamas said Israel had overturned the ceasefire agreement, leaving the fate of 59 hostages still held in Gaza uncertain.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office accused Hamas of “repeated refusal to release our hostages” and rejecting proposals from US President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\n“Israel will, from now on, act against Hamas with increasing military strength,” it said in a statement.\n\nNegotiating teams from Israel and Hamas had been in Doha as mediators from Egypt and Qatar sought to bridge the gap between the two sides following the end of an initial phase in the ceasefire, which saw 33 Israeli hostages and five Thais returned by fighter groups in Gaza in exchange for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners.\n\nWith the backing of the United States, Israel had been pressing for the return of the remaining 59 hostages still held in Gaza in exchange for a longer-term truce that would have halted fighting until after Ramazan and the Jewish Passover holiday in April.\n\nHowever, Hamas had been insisting on moving to negotiations for a permanent end to the conflict and a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, in accordance with the terms of the original ceasefire agreement.\n\n“We demand that the mediators hold Netanyahu and the Zionist occupation fully responsible for violating and overturning the agreement,” the group said.\n\nEach side has accused the other of failing to respect the terms of the January ceasefire agreement, and there were multiple hiccups during the course of the first phase. But until now, a full return to the fighting had been avoided.\n\nIsrael had blocked deliveries of aid from entering Gaza and had threatened on numerous occasions to resume fighting if Hamas did not agree to return the hostages it still holds.\n\nThe army did not provide details about the strikes carried out in the early hours of Tuesday but Palestinian health authorities and witnesses contacted by Reuters reported damage in numerous areas of Gaza, where hundreds of thousands are living in makeshift shelters or damaged buildings.\n\nA building in Gaza City, in the northern end of the strip, was hit and at least three houses were hit in Deir Al-Balah in central Gaza. In addition, the strikes hit targets in the southern cities of Khan Younis and Rafah, according to medics and witnesses.\n\nAmong those killed was senior Hamas official Mohammad Al-Jmasi, a member of the political office, and members of his family, including his grandchildren who were in his house in Gaza City when it was hit by an airstrike, Hamas sources and relatives said. In all, at least five senior Hamas officials were killed along with members of their families.",
