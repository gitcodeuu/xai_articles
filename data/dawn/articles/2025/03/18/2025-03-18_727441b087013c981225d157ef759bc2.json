Crew-10’s arrival cleared the way for Wilmore and Williams to depart, along with Hague and Gorbunov.\n\nAfter big hugs with the crew remaining on the ISS, the quartet entered the capsule and closed its hatch on Tuesday.\n\n“Colleagues and dear friends who remain on the station… we’ll be waiting for you. Crew-9 is going home,” Hague said.\n\nWilmore and Williams’ stay surpasses the standard six-month ISS rotation but ranks only sixth among US records for single-mission duration.\n\nFrank Rubio holds the top spot at 371 days in 2023, while the world record remains with Russian cosmonaut Valeri Polyakov, who spent 437 consecutive days aboard the Mir station.\n\nThat makes it “par for the course” in terms of health risks, according to Rihana Bokhari of the Centre for Space Medicine at Baylor College.\n\nChallenges such as muscle and bone loss, fluid shifts, and readjusting to gravity are well understood and well managed.\n\n“Folks like Suni Williams are actually known for their interest in exercise, and so I believe she exercises beyond what is even her normal prescription,” Bokhari told AFP.\n\nStill, the unexpected nature of their extended stay — away from their families and initially without enough packed supplies — has drawn public interest and sympathy.\n\n“If you found out you went to work today and were going to be stuck in your office for the next nine months, you might have a panic attack,” Joseph Keebler, a psychologist at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, told AFP.\n\n“These individuals have shown unbelievable resilience.”\n\nTheir unexpected stint also became a political lightning rod, with President Donald Trump and his close advisor, Elon Musk — who leads SpaceX — repeatedly suggesting former president Joe Biden abandoned the astronauts and refused an earlier rescue plan.\n\n“They shamefully forgot about the Astronauts, because they considered it to be a very embarrassing event for them,” Trump posted on Truth Social on Monday.\n\nSuch accusations have prompted an outcry in the space community, especially as Musk offered no specifics and Nasa’s plan for the astronauts’ return has remained unchanged since their Crew-9 reassignment.\n\nTrump has also drawn attention for his bizarre remarks, referring to Williams, a decorated former naval captain, as “the woman with the wild hair” and speculating about the personal dynamic between the two.\n\n“They’ve been left up there — I hope they like each other, maybe they love each other, I don’t know,” he said during a recent White House press conference.",
