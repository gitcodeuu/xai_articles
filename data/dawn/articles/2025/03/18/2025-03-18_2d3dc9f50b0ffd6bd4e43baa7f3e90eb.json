  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday issued notices to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and others on a contempt of court petition over the airline’s failure to provide compensation to the family of a pilot killed in Karachi plane crash.\n\nJustice Shahid Karim heard the petition filed by Salman Azam, a brother of the deceased pilot, questioning the non-compliance with the court orders by the authorities.\n\nThe petitioner’s lawyer informed the court that the pilot, the petitioner’s brother, was flying the PIA aircraft that crashed in Karachi in 2020.\n\nThe counsel pointed out that the court had previously ordered the PIA to provide compensatory benefits to the heirs of the pilot, but the airline had failed to comply with the orders.\n\nHe argued that defying court orders amounts to contempt of court and is a punishable offence.\n\nHe asked the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the PIA officials.\n\nThe judge heard the arguments and issued notices to the PIA and other respondents for submission of replies within two weeks.\n\nA PIA airbus A320 had taken off from Lahore and crashed in Karachi on May 22, 2020.\n\nThe catastrophic aviation disaster took the lives of 97 passengers including the crew and two people on the ground. Only two passengers had survived the crash.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 18th, 2025",
