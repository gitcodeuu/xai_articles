Consequently, the police team raided her flat in the Muslim Commercial Area to arrest her on Saturday night.\n\n“The police knocked on her door several times, but she did not open it. Her parents, along with a few of her friends, came to her apartment to try and convince her, but she did not surrender,” Taj said.\n\nAn initial police report said that the suspect had jumped to her death from the balcony. Further probe, however, showed that the woman fell after a water pipe outside the balcony that she was holding onto broke.\n\nThe incident was categorised as an accident, not a suicide. Further investigations into the incident were underway, the police added.\n\nShe suffered critical injuries and was transported to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre, where she died during treatment.\n\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said that the woman’s post-mortem was refused by her father, who took away the body without completing the legal formalities.\n\nSHO Taj said that the deceased, who belonged to a well-to-do family, was not only a drug addict but also used to sell narcotics. “She was living alone at the flat after separation from her husband, with whom she had one daughter.”\n\nHe claimed that contrabands were also found in the flat.\n\nSeparately, according to police statements, three suspected robbers were shot dead in two separate encounters in the city early morning.\n\nKalri police claimed that the encounter took place on Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai Road where, after an exchange of firing, two suspects were killed.\n\nTwo pistols, two snatched cell phones and one motorcycle were recovered from their custody, the statement said.\n\nThe police said the exchange of firing took place during patrolling. The bodies were shifted to Civil Hospital Karachi for legal formalities.\n\nIn the second incident in Shah Latif Town, one suspect was gunned down, and another was injured, police said in a statement.\n\nThe police statement added that the suspect was shot dead and his accomplice was injured, while three passersby were injured.\n\nThe statement said that the police party was patrolling near Quaidabad when they asked two suspects riding a motorcycle to stop.\n\nThey accelerated and resorted to firing in their bid to flee.\n\nAs the police chased them, and in an ensuing exchange of firing, one suspect was killed while another was arrested, Malir Senior Superintendent of Police Kashif Abbasi said.\n\nSSP Abbasi said that the suspects were looting citizens in the area, adding that the citizens were injured in the firing by the suspects.\n\nHe said that the condition of the three injured were out of danger.",
