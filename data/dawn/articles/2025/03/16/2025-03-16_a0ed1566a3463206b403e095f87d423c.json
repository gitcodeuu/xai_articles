Nevertheless, their visit was “a bit like giving them a window onto a wider stage of Christian life”, Santobonio said.\n\nOther children had arrived in the early morning from an impoverished town near Naples to deliver a letter to Francis, said Andrea Lacomini from Unicef, which organised the excursion.\n\n“He loves children, he is the pope of the children, so we are waiting for him. We’re sure he will get better,” Lacomini told AFP. “We need an important leader like him, because at this time there aren’t many heroes in the world,” he added. “He’s the only one who talks about peace.”\n\nDespite failing to appear at the window, Francis addressed his youngest well-wishers in his message.\n\n“I know that many children are praying for me; some of them came here today to ‘Gemelli’ as a sign of closeness,” Francis wrote. “Thank you, dearest children! The pope loves you and is always waiting to meet you.”\n\nLast week, the Vatican signalled that Francis was out of immediate danger after a series of breathing crises earlier in his hospitalisation had sparked fears for the pontiff’s life.\n\nOn Saturday, the Vatican said his condition continued to be stable and showing progress, but cautioned that he still needed therapies administered within the hospital setting.\n\n“The Holy Father still requires hospital medical therapy, motor and respiratory physiotherapy; these therapies, at present, are showing further, gradual improvements,” it said.\n\nThat message appeared to quash speculation that the pope’s progress could signal an imminent release from hospital.\n\nAlthough the Vatican has said he continues to work from his hospital suite when able, Francis’s absence is particularly felt as Easter approaches, the holiest period in the Christian calendar just five weeks away.\n\nThe head of the world’s nearly 1.4 billion Catholics traditionally presides over a busy programme of events during the period, including a Good Friday evening procession and Easter mass in St Peter’s Square before tens of thousands of faithful.\n\nIn his written message on Sunday — which also called for peace in war-torn countries including Ukraine, Myanmar and Sudan — Francis once again thanked his caretakers and those who have been praying for him.\n\n“How much light shines, in this sense, in hospitals and places of care! How much loving care illuminates the rooms, the corridors, the clinics, the places where the humblest services are performed!” he wrote.",
