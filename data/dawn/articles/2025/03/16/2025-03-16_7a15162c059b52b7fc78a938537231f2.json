  "content": "ANURADHAPURA: Sri Lanka carried out a nationwide census on Saturday of nuisance wildlife, including monkeys and peacocks, in a bid to prepare countermeasures to protect crops, officials said.\n\nSome 40,000 local officials were deployed to count wild boar, lorises, peacocks, and monkeys near farms and homes during a five-minute period on Saturday morning.\n\nIn the north-central district of Anuradhapura, farmer families gathered in open fields to count the animals and record them in sheets provided by the agriculture ministry. “We are having census during a very short time period to ensure there is no double counting,” ministry official Ajith Pushpakumara told reporters in the capital Colombo.“We are expecting that the results will be about 80 per cent accurate. After we have an idea of the number of these animals, we can plan out the next steps to deal with them.”\n\nIn Anuradhapura, 200 kilometres north of Colombo, residents were out early in the fields preparing for the census. “We had a very successful count from very enthusiastic participants. They are the farmers who continuously suffer crop damage. Our count was 227 toque monkeys and 65 purple faced langurs,” Chaminda Dissanayake, an agriculture department bureaucrat who conducted the census at Anuradhapura’s Mihintale area said.\n\nOpposition legislator Nalin Bandara criticised the census, calling it a “waste of money”. “This is a complete failure, a waste of money. What about the pests that attack farms at night. They are not being counted,” said Bandara, adding that newer technologies could have been deployed for the counting exercise.\n\nOfficials say more than a third of crops are destroyed by wild animals, including elephants, which are protected by law as they are considered sacred. While elephants are major raiders of rice farms and fruit plantations, they were not counted in Saturday’s census.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 16th, 2025",
