However, he said he expected the government to make commitments for reforms that would lead to the signing of the SLA.\n\nInitially, it was expected that the Fund would demand a mini-budget to bridge the revenue shortfall, but it instead made significant revisions to the total Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) revenue collection target by adjusting for declines in inflation and growth. The combined impact of these two was estimated to be more than Rs600 billion.\n\nTop tax officials at the FBR appeared at ease with the review’s findings, describing it as a positive step. “We are no longer concerned about our tax collection target following adjustments,” a senior tax official said, adding that there was no longer a drive for revenue collection under the Tajir Dost Scheme.\n\nHowever, the IMF has urged the FBR to unlock the true potential of real estate. The tax-to-GDP ratio will not be revised from the current 10.6 per cent target. “We will exceed this target,” the official stated.\n\nAn official source said that IMF delegation had handed over the Memorandum of Economic and Fiscal Policies (MEFP) to the finance ministry, which would now forward the relevant sections to the ministries and divisions concerned for further action.\n\nThe talks would continue virtually on the remaining issues to finalise the MEFP, according to the official, and would culminate with the announcement of the SLA. This would be followed by IMF’s Executive Board approval for the disbursement of about $1.1bn by early next month.\n\nThe IMF statement did not specifically hint at the sticking point which caused delays in reaching an agreement on the SLA.\n\nPakistan secured the $7bn IMF programme in July 2024 to stabilise its economy and lay the foundation for sustainable growth. The 37-month EFF comprises six performance reviews, with the release of the next $1.1bn tranche contingent on the successful completion of this review.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 16th, 2025",
