  "content": "Pakistan slumped to a nine-wicket loss to in the first Twenty20 against New Zealand in Christchurch on Sunday after failing to defend a meagre score of 91.\n\nThe tourists began the five-match series in disastrous fashion, reduced to 11-4 at the end of the fifth over after towering paceman Kyle Jamieson ran amok with the new ball.\n\nThey were eventually dismissed for their lowest score in a T20 on New Zealand soil and the home side had few problems in responding with 92-1 off just 10.1 overs.\n\nJamieson claimed three of the first four wickets to finish with 3-8 off four overs.\n\nNew ball partner Jacob Duffy returned later in the innings to sweep up the tail and, like Jamieson, claimed career-best T20 figures of 4-14 off 3.4 overs.\n\nPakistan never recovered from their top-order collapse after being sent in on a Hagley Oval pitch offering early life, with only three players reaching double figures.\n\nNewly-installed captain Salman Agha scored 18 and put on 46 for the fifth wicket with top-scorer Khushdil Shah, who struck three sixes in his 32 off 30 balls.\n\nJahandad Khan scored 17 at a run-a-ball before the innings ended with eight balls still to be bowled.\n\nPakistan’s previous lowest T20 score in New Zealand was 101 all out in a 95-run loss in Wellington in 2016.\n\nOpener Tim Seifert got New Zealand off to a flying start, with 44 off 29 balls, striking seven fours and one six.\n\nFinn Allen on 29 and Tim Robinson on 18 completed the chase off the first ball of the 11th over.\n\nThe second match is in Dunedin on Tuesday.",
