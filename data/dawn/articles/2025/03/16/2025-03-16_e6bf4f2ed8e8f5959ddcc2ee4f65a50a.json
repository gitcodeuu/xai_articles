I was pushing, especially the last two laps — it was a little bit stressful, not going to lie,” said Norris.\n\n“Tricky conditions, but there are the ones that are enjoyable, and we ended up on top, so I’m happy.”\n\nVerstappen, who is aiming to become only the second driver to win five straight world titles after Michael Schumacher, was in the hunt early, but an uncharacteristic error on lap 18 dented his chances until another safety car put him back in the frame.\n\n“It was a difficult race, but at the end, it was fun,” said the Dutch star.\n\n“It was pushing, fighting for the win, but I’m just happy to bring it home, score good points, and this is a good start for us.”\n\nIn the unpredictable conditions, with rain on-and-off, Mercedes’ Kimi Antonelli was an eye-opening fourth on his debut while Williams’ Alex Albon came an encouraging fifth.\n\nAston Martin’s Lance Stroll was sixth ahead of Nico Hulkenberg in a Sauber.\n\nFerrari’s Charles Leclerc came eighth, with Norris’ teammate Oscar Piastri and Hamilton rounding out the top 10.\n\nRussell was content with third, given the circumstances.\n\n“It was a great race to come home in P3. And well done to Lando, a race like that when you are leading is probably your worst nightmare,” he said.\n\n“I was quite enjoying it, to be honest, hoping the two guys ahead made a mistake and I could slip through.”\n\nWhile torrential rain eased for the main event, the tricky conditions were rammed home when Hadjar skidded and hit the wall on the formation lap and was out before the race even started.\n\nThe start was aborted, and when the green lights finally came on, Norris, on intermediate tyres, made a clean jump and kept his position at the first corner.\n\nVerstappen also had a flying start and passed Piastri to go second while Leclerc moved up two places to fifth.\n\nBut the race was interrupted minutes later when Doohan ploughed into the wall, then the experienced Sainz did the same on his Williams debut.\n\nThey restarted after a safety car with Norris holding his spot ahead of Verstappen, and with Piastr,i they began pulling clear of fourth-placed Russell.\n\nWith the track drying, the gap to Russell was eight seconds by lap 13.\n\nBut with his tyres starting to wear, Verstappen brushed the gravel on lap 18, and Piastri flashed past back into second.\n\nNorris and Piastri powered 18 seconds ahead of the Dutchman before Fernando Alonso put his Aston Martin into the wall on lap 34, and the safety car came out again.\n\nAll teams used the opportunity to make their pit stops, with Norris and Piastri emerging on hards and Verstappen on mediums.\n\nAfter the safety car peeled off, Norris flew into a two-second lead before Piastri, pushing hard, skidded onto the grass to drop down the field as Verstappen powered past.\n\nBut again, a safety car was required when Red Bull’s Liam Lawson spun, with Norris, Verstappen and Russell the top three at the restart with seven laps left.\n\nVerstappen pressed Norris hard for the win when they got going again, but the Briton was able to hold on.",
