  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government on Saturday dec­ided to keep the petroleum prices unchanged, contr­ary to expectations they wo­uld fall by up to Rs14 per litre for the next two weeks due to fluctuations in the international market.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif decided to use the extra fiscal space to reduce electricity tariffs.\n\nAn official statement released on Saturday said the government had deci­ded to keep the prices unchanged.\n\nThe prime minister has decided to use the added revenue to reduce electricity tariffs, the statement added, signalling a major relief for the public in coming days.\n\nThe per litre price of petrol will remain at Rs255.63.\n\nThe prices of high-speed diesel, light diesel oil and kerosene will remain at Rs258.64, Rs153.34 and Rs168.13, respectively.\n\nThe calculations submitted to the petroleum division by the industry a few days back proposed a cut of up to Rs14.16 per litre in petroleum prices in line with the trend in the global market.\n\nThe ex-depot price of petrol was estimated to drop by Rs14.16 per litre and that of diesel by Rs8.70.\n\nA cut of Rs10.33 per litre was calculated for the price of kerosene and Rs7.12 for light diesel oil.\n\nThe PM office statement highlighted that the move was part of a broader strategy to ease the burden on consumers struggling with high utility costs.\n\n“We have decided to maintain fuel prices at the existing level and pass on the entire financial benefit to electricity tariffs,” the prime minister said.\n\nThe statement added that a formal announcement on the details of the relief package is expected soon.\n\nThe PM is likely to announce these relief measures in his address to the nation in the coming weeks.\n\nThe statement added that a detailed plan to lower electricity prices was in the final stages, with officials working on a structured relief package.\n\nHe emphasised that this initiative, coupled with other measures, would bring about a “meaningful reduction” in power tariffs.\n\nPM Shehbaz stressed that the reduction in electricity costs would have a ripple effect on inflation, potentially easing price pressures across the economy.\n\n“Lower power tariffs will not only benefit consumers directly but will also help in curbing overall inflation.”\n\nThe PM added that since coming to power last year, his government has prioritised public relief.\n\nHe reaffirmed the commitment to providing further relief to the masses in the coming weeks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 16th, 2025",
