  "content": "PESHAWAR: Awami National Party (ANP) senior leader Haji Ghulam Ahmad Bilour has highlighted the significance of the party president Aimal Wali Khan’s statement about law and order situation in Balochistan, urging those in power to adopt a far-sighted approach.\n\nIn a statement issued here on Saturday, Mr Bilour said that the United States’ intentions to gain control of Gwadar Port posed a substantial threat to Pakistan`s sovereignty.\n\nSenator Aimal Wali Khan had claimed a few days ago that preparations were being made for a new war between China and America in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.\n\nMr Bilour said that the US had long been opposed to China`s control of Gwadar Port and its interests in Afghanistan were in fact driven by a desire to secure the port. He cautioned that if the US and China were to clash over the issue, the consequences would be devastating, with the war potentially spreading to the streets and cities of Punjab.\n\nHe recalled his earlier suggestions to former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Ahsan Iqbal to reroute the Gwadar corridor through Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to reduce distance and cost.\n\nHowever, he said that his proposal was not implemented and now Punjab faced a significant threat.\n\nBilours concerns echo the sentiments of many, who fear that Pakistans strategic location and resources make it vulnerable to external manipulation. As tensions between the US and China continue to rise, Pakistan must navigate this complex geopolitical landscape with caution and foresight.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 16th, 2025",
