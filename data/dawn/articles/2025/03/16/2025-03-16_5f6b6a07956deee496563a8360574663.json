As the driver attempted to move it forward, he lost control and the coach plunged more than 200 metres below.\n\nThe driver, Zahid, son of Mehtab Rathore, jumped out of the vehicle onto the road as the coaster was about to plunge downwards and was at large.\n\nThe deceased were identified as Abdul Rauf Rathore, son of Khan Muhammad; Malik Sher Baz, son of Suba Khan Awan; Chaudhry Muhammad Khurshid, son of Muhammad Din Gujjar; Khalid Hussain, son of Nek Alam; and Shamim, wife of Qayyum Khan Rathore.\n\nThe injured were identified as Arif Ali, son of Chaudhry Sultan; Imran Ayub, son of Muhammad Ayub; and Zeeshan, son of Khalid Gulshan.\n\nExpressing grief over the tragedy, AJK Minister for Local Government and Rural Development Faisal Mumtaz Rathore, extended his heartfelt condolences to the bereaved families.\n\nRathore, who represents Haveli in the AJK Legislative Assembly, prayed for the departed souls and swift recovery of the injured, assuring that all possible assistance would be provided to the affected families.\n\nFatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain and poor infrastructure. Last year, AJK saw a string of accidents claiming the lives of at least 14 people in just December.\n\nOn Dec 15, 2024, a toddler was among four killed while seven others sustained injuries when a jeep skidded off a frost-covered track in the upper belt of Neelum Valley.\n\nLater that month, four members of a family were killed, and three others were injured when their vehicle plummeted into a ditch in AJK’s Sudhnoti district.\n\nThe next day, four members of a wedding party died, and the groom was injured as their car skidded off the road and crashed into the icy Neelum River.\n\nTwo days later, a tourist couple from Sialkot lost their lives, while their minor daughter sustained critical injuries when their car plunged off a road and landed on the rocky bank of the Neelum River.",
