It indicates that the animal might have the infection in the past or had been exposed to TB infected animals at some point.\n\n“No treatment is required for a latent TB infection as elephants can stay lifelong carriers [of the bacteria]. But, this condition can turn into an active infection, if their immune system weakens that would then require immediate treatment as they can spread the disease [to humans and animals],” he said.\n\nAccording to Dr Khalil, a culture test is the only way to be 100 per cent sure about the elephants’ infection status without which the treatment can’t start.\n\n“Having said that, the elephants right now are being looked after as ‘infected’ and the same is shown in their official records. We have made recommendations for maximum caution given the severity of the disease that they might have,” he said, adding: “We are keeping our fingers crossed and the good news is that all the keepers have tested negative for TB.”\n\n‘Challenging treatment’\n\nTB in elephants, Dr Khalil points out, is treatable but the treatment is costly, can take one to over two years and the medicines have sure side-effects including loss of weight.\n\n“This is why it’s important to be sure that they have an active TB infection before starting the treatment. It involves intra-rectal administration of drugs for which the animals and the staff both required training,” he said.\n\nSafari Park Director Amjad Zaidi shared that the KMC was ensuring the best treatment to elephants, both of which were in good condition. “The mayor is taking personal interest in their care. It’s good that the disease is detected in its initial stages.”\n\nThe sources said samples for TB’s confirmation were drawn last month in trunk wash testing — a diagnostic procedure for elephants designed specifically for culturing TB germs. But, they couldn’t give complete results due to low bacterial count.\n\nThe FP team comprising Dr Khalil, Dr Marina Ivanova and Dr Frank Goritz is expected to arrive later this month to collect the samples again.\n\nIt might be recalled that the city has lost two of the four captive elephants in less than two years.\n\nThe KMC has recently set up an 18-member body to look after their well-being.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
