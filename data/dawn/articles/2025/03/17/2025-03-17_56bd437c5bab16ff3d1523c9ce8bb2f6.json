However, the statement said, that the “injured police party sent one khawarij to hell while six to seven terrorists succeeded in fleeing”.\n\nLater, the police led by DPO Ishaq destroyed temporary hideouts of TTP terrorists on the border of Lakki Marwat and Karak, the CPO highlighted.\n\n“During the entire operation, KP Inspector General of Police (IG) Zulfiqar Hameed was in constant contact with the Lakki and Karak DPOs to instruct them.”\n\nA second terrorist was killed in the Tank district, while “many” were injured in an hours-long retaliatory action by the police after the Nasraan checkpost was attacked, according to the CPO statement.\n\nThe statement also recalled the martyrdoms of additional sub-inspector (ASI) Islam Noor Khan in an assault on Karak’s Takht-e-Nasrati police station, as well as of cons­t­able Nazar Ali in an attack on Peshawar’s Paj­gai post last night.\n\nThe CPO statement noted that all attacks “conducted in the dark of the night were responded to with immense bravery and courage by the KP police, who retaliated strongly while keeping control over their senses”.\n\nThe residents of the area also participated in the response “side by side with the police”, the CPO added.\n\nIt lauded the public for “openly coming to the field along with the police against terrorism”, saying it proved that they stood with their “defenders”.\n\nThe statement quoted IG Hameed as asserting that the police, along with other law enforcement agencies and the people, would “once again control the rising monster of terrorism”.",
