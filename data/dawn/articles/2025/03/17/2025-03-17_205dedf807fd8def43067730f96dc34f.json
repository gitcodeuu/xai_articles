  "content": "KHYBER: The Pakistani authorities have constituted a new 26-member jirga to hold further talks in Afghanistan over reopening of Torkham border, as positive signals have been received after the March 12 sudden postponement of its second meeting with the Afghan jirga members due to some misunderstanding.\n\nSources told Dawn that the new jirga would consist of 26 members with some experienced and influential tribal elders and local traders, mostly members of Khyber Chamber of Commerce and Industry.\n\nThey said that authorities were vetting the names of new jirga members as Afghan authorities had earlier sent a message of sharing those names in anticipation of the second round of the jirga meeting in Afghanistan to be held today (Monday).\n\nA 57-member jirga comprising tribal elders, traders, transporters, local government representatives and some clerics held its first meeting with Afghan jirga, mostly comprising members of Afghan Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Torkham on March 9 in an effort to find a workable solution to the ongoing stalemate at Torkham.\n\nJirga consists of tribal elders and Khyber traders\n\nTorkham border was abruptly closed down on February 21 after Pakistan objected to reconstruction and renovation of a security checkpoint near the border crossing on the Afghan side.\n\nSecurity officials had then contended that Afghanistan violated border protocols as the two neighbouring countries had agreed to take each other into confidence about any change in the existing structure of the border.\n\nThe Pakistani jirga had in their March 9 meeting with Afghan delegates conveyed an official message about strict adherence to the agreed protocols with border reopening conditional to no new construction for security purposes on the Afghan side.\n\nBoth sides then agreed to meet again on March 12 on the Afghan soil but the meeting could not materialise due to a miscommunication by a non-local member of the Khyber chamber, which greatly annoyed the entire Pakistani jirga.\n\nA senior member of the Pakistani jirga told Dawn on condition of anonymity that security officials too were not happy with the ‘irresponsible’ behaviour of one of Khyber chamber members and it was decided to considerably ‘downsize’ the jirga.\n\nHe said that authorities wanted a closely net jirga with adequate understanding of the border situation and also well-versed on both the tribal affairs and bilateral trade relations between the two countries.\n\n“This will be a small but fully authorised jirga with powers to make prompt and on the spot decisions if need arises” the tribal elder said and added that it was very difficult to manage and discipline a large jirga.\n\nHe said that there were some irrelevant and inexperienced men in the previous jirga and it was also alleged that they were behind the wrong message, which was sent to the Afghan delegation on March 12 about the cancellation of the second round of jirga sitting.\n\nHe expressed his optimism that the new jirga may travel to Afghanistan in a couple of days after it got a green signal from the Afghanistan side, which was also fully focused on resumption of talks and subsequent reopening of the border.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
