  "content": "LAHORE: South African Corbin Bosch has been served a legal notice by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) “alleging breach of the all-rounder’s contractual obligations” to the board, it said on Sunday.\n\nThe 30-year-old Bosch was picked by Peshawar Zalmi in the Diamond category during the 10th edition of the HBL Pakistan Super League Player Draft, held in Lahore on January 13.\n\nHowever, Indian Premier League (IPL) side Mumbai Indians had also signed him as a replacement for his injured compatriot Lizaad Williams.\n\nBosch’s signing with Mumbai meant he will forgo his PSL contract, as the IPL begins on March 22 and overlaps with the PSL’s April-May schedule.\n\nThe legal notice was served through his agent, and the player has been asked to justify his actions of withdrawing from his professional and contractual commitments.\n\nThe PCB management said it had outlined the repercussions of his departure from the league and said it expected Bosch’s response within the stipulated time frame.\n\nThe 2025 season would be the first instance of the PSL window clashing with a part of the IPL since the inception of the former in 2016.\n\nThe PCB had to move its PSL window from its regular February-March to April-May because of the Champions Trophy and other international commitments in Pakistan.\n\nNumber of overseas players who were not picked in the IPL auction later signed on for the PSL, including Bosch.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
