  "content": "SWAT: A group of girl students at a Saidu Sharif college here have expressed their heartfelt gratitude towards Malala Yousafzai, Shazia Rehman, and Kayenat Riaz for their generous donation that resulted in the installation of a solar power system in their institution.\n\nThe initiative is proving to be a game-changer, particularly in overcoming the challenges posed by frequent power outages.\n\nThe solar system was funded by the compensation amount provided by the three young women after the tragic 2012 shooting incident, in which they were injured while returning home from school.\n\nInstead of keeping the compensation for themselves, Malala, Shazia, and Kayenat chose to invest the funds in a project that would benefit students in the educational community. A solar power system was installed and toilet and washroom facilities were provided at the BS block of the college with the funds.\n\n“Loadshedding is frequent here, and it severely affects our ability to study. Without electricity, we are unable to complete our assignments or prepare for examinations,” said Sana Khan, a student of BS English.\n\nToilet, washroom facilities also provided to college’s BS block\n\nStudents also highlighted the discomfort caused by prolonged power outages, especially during the summer months. “During the summer, the heat on the upper floors becomes unbearable, and without fans, it becomes impossible to concentrate on our studies,” said Anisa, a student of BS Psychology. “In addition to the heat, there are also issues with mosquitoes, which add to our discomfort during long hours without electric supply.”\n\nTauheed Rehman, a student of BS Mathematics, shared concerns about the impact of power outages on essential academic activities. “We need electricity for research and online work. During one of our final exams, the loadshedding lasted for more than 10 hours, which disrupted our studies and negatively impacted our exam performance.”\n\nThe installation of the solar system has been a much-needed solution. Students can now study uninterrupted, even during power cuts. “With the solar system in place, we can study and complete our work without any hindrance. This will undoubtedly improve our academic performance,” said one of the grateful students.\n\nThe gesture by Malala, Shazia, and Kayenat has made a significant impact on the students’ lives, demonstrating how small acts of kindness can create meaningful change in communities. The solar system has not only improved students’ access to power but also boosted morale, providing a sense of relief and encouragement for their academic pursuits.\n\nMalala Yousafzai has long been committed to fighting for girls’ education rights and resources in Pakistan, with a particular focus on empowering girls through education. Pakistan remains a core focus country for the Malala Fund, where she supports a number of partners and organisations advocating for girls’ education in the region.\n\nThis year, Malala continued to work for girls’ rights with her visits to Pakistan, including a keynote speech at the Muslim World League’s education conference. She also visited Shangla, although details of the school visit are being kept private to respect the students’ privacy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
