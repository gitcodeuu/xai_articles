Some of the serious cases were to be taken to other European countries for treatment.\n\nThe blaze started in the Club Pulse in the eastern town of Kocani around 3am (0200 GMT), as the place was packed with more than 1,000 mostly young fans attending a concert by a popular hip-hop duo called DNK.\n\n“Initially we didn’t believe there was a fire. Then there was huge panic in the crowd and a stampede to get out,” one young woman who was at the concert told local media outside a hospital in the capital Skopje.\n\nFire crews and paramedics responded quickly and “tried to resuscitate people… but it wasn’t enough”, said the woman, who was waiting outside for one of her friends, who was being treated for burns to his hand.\n\nThe fire was probably caused by the use of pyrotechnic devices “used for light effects at the concert”, said Interior Minister Pance Toskovski, who visited the scene with Prime Minister Hristijan Mickoski.\n\n“Sparks caught the ceiling, which was made of easily flammable material, after which the fire rapidly spread across the whole discotheque, creating thick smoke,” Toskovski said.\n\nThe interior ministry announced that arrest warrants had been issued for four people in relation to the tragedy, and a criminal investigation opened.\n\nThey did not immediately give further details about those targeted by the warrants.\n\n“According to the information that we have, there are 59 persons deceased of which 35 are identified. Of the identified, 31 persons are from Kocani and four from Stip,” Toskovski said.\n\n“The number of wounded, according to latest information up to noon (1100 GMT), is 155 persons who are in hospitals across the country,” Toskovski said.\n\n“Preparations are being made to transport people seriously injured in the fire in Kocani to top hospitals in several European countries,” the head of North Macedonia’s Crisis Centre, Stojanche Angelov, said.\n\nThe head of the Kocani hospital, Kristina Serafimovska, told media that the patients being treated there were aged between 14 and 25.\n\n“Seventy of the patients have burns and carbon monoxide poisoning,” she said.\n\nOne of the members of the DNK duo that had performed, Vladimir Blazev, had burns to his face and needed assistance breathing, his sister told local media outlets.\n\n“This is a difficult and very sad day” for the country, Prime Minister Mickoski wrote on his Facebook account. “The loss of so many young lives is irreparable, and the grief of their families, their loved ones and their friends is immeasurable,” he said.\n\nPope Francis sent prayers to the victims and survivors and wished “the families of the dead, mostly young people, the expression of his deep condolence, signifying spiritual closeness to the wounded”, the Vatican said in a message addressed to the bishop of Skopje, Kiro Stojanov.\n\nVideos posted on social networks and shot before the fire showed the use of “stage fountains”, which are a type of indoor fireworks used during performances.\n\nOther videos published by media showed huge flames emerging from the building, a two-storey white structure in Kocani town.\n\nLeaders of neighbouring countries offered help.\n\nBulgarian Prime Minister Rossen Jeliazkov spoke on Facebook of the fire being “a huge human tragedy” and offered to have his air force fly some of those injured to medical facilities in the Bulgarian capital Sofia and the city of Varna.\n\nGreek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on X, formerly Twitter, that he sent “heartfelt condolences to the people of North Macedonia for the lives lost in the tragic fire”.\n\n“Greece stands ready to assist in this difficult time,” he added.\n\nAlbanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said he was “at a loss for words” and expressed readiness “to provide any assistance that may be needed”.\n\nThere were also messages from parts of the European Union, which North Macedonia has ambitions to join.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
