The breakthrough is poised to revolutionise studies of star formation, exoplanets and potentially the origins of life.\n\n“Interstellar dust — tiny solid particles scattered across the galaxy — acts like a cosmic fog, absorbing and scattering starlight, which is called extinction,” said Zhang Xiangyu, a Chinese doctoral student at the Max Planck Institute in Germany.\n\nFor decades, astronomers had to correct observations using oversimplified models, assuming homogeneous dust behaved uniformly.\n\n“But dust properties vary across regions. Using a one-size-fits-all extinction curve was like navigating with a flawed GPS,” said Zhang, who conducted the study with his mentor, Gregory M. Green.\n\nThe team combined two million stellar spectra from LAMOST with positional and spectroscopic data from the European Gaia space observatory, creating a dynamic 3D map that tracks how dust extinction changes by location and wavelength.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
