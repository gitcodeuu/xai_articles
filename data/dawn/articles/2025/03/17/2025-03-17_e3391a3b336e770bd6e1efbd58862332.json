The USICH, which aims to prevent and end homelessness, will face challenges in coordinating its efforts, risking fragmented services and reduced effectiveness nationwide.\n\nThe FMCS provides mediation and conflict resolution services to prevent or resolve labour disputes and improve labour-management relations.\n\nEliminating the CDFI Fund could reduce investments in underserved communities, stalling economic development and perpetuating financial disparities. Additionally, minority-owned businesses might lose critical support services though the closure of MBDA, hindering their growth and contributing to widening economic inequalities.\n\nAlthough the total number of employees across these agencies is unclear, media reports suggest that between 400 and 500 individuals are employed by these institutions.\n\nAs a group, USAGM employs roughly 3,500 workers with an $886-million budget in 2024, according to its latest report to Congress.\n\nSince Trump’s inauguration on January 20, 2025, the administration has significantly reduced the federal workforce. Over 200,000 federal employees have been laid off across multiple agencies, part of a broader strategy led by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) to slash government expenditures.\n\nVOA falls silent\n\nA review of VOA’s various websites showed they had not been updated since March 15, and its radio stations have also fallen silent after broadcasting for around 80 years.\n\nThe closure of VOA will affect over 100 Pakistani journalists working for its Urdu and Pashto services. VOA operated bureaus in Washington, Islamabad, Karachi, and Lahore, broadcasting in nearly 50 languages.\n\nAlongside VOA, USAGM also runs Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and Radio Free Asia. CBS and BBC News reported that the bosses of both had been notified that their federal grants had been terminated.\n\nThe president had defended his move by accusing VOA of being “anti-Trump” and “radical.” On the other hand, critics of VOA have long accused the outlet of being a mouthpiece for US propaganda.\n\nCriticism\n\nAccording to Reuters, Paris-based Reporters Without Borders (RSF) blasted the move, with its director general, Thibaut Bruttin, saying it “threatens press freedom worldwide and negates 80 years of American history in supporting a free flow of information.”\n\nThe president of the National Press Club in Washington, Mike Balsamo, also released a statement saying the cuts at VOA undermined America’s commitment to a free and independent press.\n\nThe Association for International Broadcasting has called on the Trump administration to reverse its decision to slash federal funding to Voice of America and several other pro-democracy news media, warning it would embolden authoritarian regimes worldwide, the Financial Times reported.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
