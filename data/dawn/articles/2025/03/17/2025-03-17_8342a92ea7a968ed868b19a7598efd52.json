  "content": "ISLAMABAD / GUJRAT: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday praised the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and Intelligence Bureau (IB) for their role in apprehending the ringleader of a notorious human trafficking network.\n\nDuring a high-level meeting with FIA and IB officials, attended by federal ministers and the interior secretary, the prime minister expressed hope that the relentless efforts of law enforcement agencies would help eliminate the menace of human trafficking in the country. The meeting was bro­ad­cast live on national television.\n\nPM Shehbaz particularly acknowledged the arrest of Usman Jajja, a key figure in multiple human trafficking cases. “The black business of human trafficking has brought a bad name to Pakistan, causing the loss of numerous lives in boat capsize incidents near Italy and Morocco and leading to global embarrassment,” he said.\n\nThe prime minister emphasised that he convened the meeting to personally convey his appreciation to the FIA and IB officers on behalf of the government and the people. He urged officials to intensify their efforts to combat trafficking and restore Pakistan’s reputation.\n\nThe prime minister also awarded appreciation shields and cheques to different officials who took part in the operations to bust the gangs.\n\nDuring the meeting, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and the interior secretary briefed the PM about the performance of the agencies.\n\nThe director generals of FIA and IB also briefed the prime minister about the arrest of gang leaders, operators and facilitators involved in human trafficking.\n\nWho is Usman Jajja?\n\nThe arrested ringleader, Usman Ali Jajja, is a resident of the Mohrikey Jajja village in Sialkot’s Pasrur tehsil and a notorious member of the Jajja human trafficking syndicate.\n\nWith the active connivance of some others, Jajja is accused of extorting Rs39.3 million from 19 Pakistani migrants, luring them with false promises of jobs in Italy, only to abandon them in Libya, where they endured torture and coercion.\n\nHis operation came to light in December 2024, following the Greece boat tragedy, in which at least five Pakistani migrants lost their lives when an overloaded vessel capsized in the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nDespite being in Sialkot jail at the time of the boat tragedy — for an unrelated case involving a clash with a rival group — he managed to evade the FIA after securing bail.\n\nAuthorities have linked him to 19 criminal cases, registered under Sections 17 and 22 of Emigration Ordinance, and Sections 3 and 6 of the Prevention of Smuggling of Migrants Act.\n\nJajja is part of the Khurram Jajja group, a notorious trafficking syndicate that has exploited countless migrants by promising them safe passage to Europe. This network, divided into two factions, is led by Qamar Zaman and Usman Jajja on one side and Asif Jajja on the other.\n\nQamar Zaman and another key suspect, Saqib Jajja, are reportedly based in Libya.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2025",
