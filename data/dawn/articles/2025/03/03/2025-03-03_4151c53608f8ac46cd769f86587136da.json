The 10 detainees in the lawsuit are all men from Pakistan and three other countries with final deportation orders, including some who have been threatened with transfer to Guantanamo, ACLU said.\n\nUS Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin on Saturday called the ACLU legal challenge “baseless” and said the agency would work with the Justice Department to fight the lawsuit.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to deport record numbers of immigrants who are in the US illegally. As part of efforts to expand deportations, the administration in early February began sending migrants to a detention camp on the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, best known for holding foreign terrorism suspects.\n\nCuban and Haitian migrants intercepted at sea have been held at a migrant facility on the base for decades. However, the Trump administration’s effort was the first to transfer migrants there from the America, according to ACLU.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem claimed they were sending only “the worst of the worst” to Guantanamo, but about a third of the initial group of 177 Venezuelans had no criminal record, according to the department.\n\nThe ACLU lawsuit apprised the court that migrants detained at Guantanamo had been “held in windowless rooms for at least 23 hours per day, subjected to invasive strip searches, and unable to contact family members”.\n\nThe suit said that guards “engage in verbal and physical abuse”, including strapping detainees to a chair, withholding water, threatening to shoot detainees, and fracturing one person’s hand. “These degrading conditions and extreme isolation have led to several suicide attempts,” the complaint said.\n\nA federal judge blocked the possible transfer of several Venezuelan migrants to Guantanamo in mid-February, but the men — also represented by ACLU — were then deported to Venezuela.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025",
