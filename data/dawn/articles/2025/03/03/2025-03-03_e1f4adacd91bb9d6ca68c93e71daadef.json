So, you can’t go thinking ‘we played like this yesterday, and today we’ll play like this’.\n\n“We don’t know which pitch is going to be played in the semi-final. But whatever happens, we have to adapt and see what is happening.\n\n“This is not our home, this is Dubai. We don’t play so many matches here. This is new for us too.”\n\nIndia are unbeaten in this year’s tournament but Rohit predicted tough contest against Australia.\n\n“Look, Australia have been such a great team over the years,” said Rohit. “So we will expect some fightbacks, we will expect some nervy times as well in the middle.\n\n“But that is how the game is being played these days. And you are talking about a semi-final,” the Indian skipper said.\n\nHe acknowledged: “Look, it is a great opposition to play against.\n\n“All we have to do is what we have been thinking about the last three games and we have to approach that game in a similar fashion. We understand the opposition and how they play and stuff like that.”\n\nIndia went in with four spinners including two all-rounders in their last group match in Dubai and came up trumps with Chakravarthy returning figures of 5-42.\n\nRohit said he will be tempted to keep the same combination against Australia.\n\n“He just showed what he is capable of,” Rohit said of man of the match Chakravarthy, a wrist spinner with many variations up his sleeve.\n\n“Now it is up to us to think and see how we can get that combination right. He did everything that was asked for… it is a good headache to have.”\n\nAustralia captain Steve Smith says his team are confident they can counter India’s spin attack in the semi-final in Dubai.\n\nAustralia beat rivals England by five wickets in their opening match but their next two games were abandoned because of rain in the Pakistani cities of Rawalpindi and Lahore.\n\n“Yeah, I mean, not just Chakravarthy, I think the rest of their spin is quality as well,” Smith told reporters on Monday, talking about India’s bowling lineup. “So I think for us, the game is probably won and lost how we play their spin, particularly in the middle overs, the way we get through there. It’s going to be a challenge…\n\n“I think there’s going to be some spin, by the looks of it. Yeah, we’ve got to counter that… We’ve got a few options of ways we can go about it.”\n\nThe world champions are missing several key players, including fast bowlers Pat Cummins, Josh Hazlewood and Mitchell Starc due to injuries.\n\nBut Smith said they could call upon part-time spinners, including Travis Head and Marnus Labuschagne, to support Adam Zampa and Glenn Maxwell on a track he believes “looks a dry surface”.\n\n“We’ve got a lot of part-time options that could certainly play a role on here and a couple of front-liners as well,” he said.\n\nCooper Connolly, a batting all-rounder who bowls left-arm spin, has joined the squad as a replacement for Matthew Short, who was ruled out of the rest of the tournament due to a thigh injury.\n\nWhen asked about India’s playing on only one ground, Smith played down any perceived disadvantage.\n\n“We guessed right in the end,” Smith said on his team’s travelling to Dubai. “We had a little reset and a chance to have a couple of days here outside of a pretty strict sort of bubble, I suppose, in Pakistan with the security and stuff. It’s been nice to just have a couple of days chill here, a bit of training.”\n\nAustralia beat India by six wickets in the 2023 World Cup final, with Head hitting an unbeaten 137.\n\n“I mean, there’s pressure every time you play in a big game,” said Smith of Head. “But, as we know, Travis has stood up in many of those in the past. And, you know, he looked in great touch the other night against Afghanistan.\n\n“I’m sure he’s going to be looking to come out here and play the same way he’s played for a long time, with good intent, good aggression.”\n\nHeader image: India’s captain Rohit Sharma (L) and his teammate Virat Kohli (C) celebrate their team’s win in the ICC Champions Trophy ODI match between New Zealand and India at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on March 2, 2025. — AFP",
