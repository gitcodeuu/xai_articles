Syria’s new authorities have repealed the Assad-era constitution, and Sharaa has said rewriting it could take up to three years.\n\nIn late January, Sharaa promised a “constitutional declaration” to serve as a “legal reference” during the country’s transitional period. Sunday’s announcement came “based on the Syrian people’s aspirations in building their state based on the rule of law, and building on the outcomes of the Syrian national dialogue conference”, said the presidency.\n\nIt also came “with the aim of preparing the legal framework regulating the transitional phase”, it added.\n\nA national dialogue conference held this week in Damascus set out a path for the new Syria.\n\nMembers\n\nThe committee includes Abdul Hamid al-Awak, who holds a doctorate in constitutional law and lectures at a university in Turkiye, and Yasser al-Huwaish, who was appointed this year as dean of Damascus university’s law faculty.\n\nIt also includes Bahia Mardini — the sole woman — a journalist with a doctorate in law who has been living in Britain, and Ismail al-Khalfan, who holds a doctorate in law specialising in international law, and who this year was appointed law faculty dean at Aleppo university.\n\nAnother committee member, Mohammed Reda Jalkhi, holds a doctorate in law specialising in international law from Idlib university, where he graduated in 2023.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025",
