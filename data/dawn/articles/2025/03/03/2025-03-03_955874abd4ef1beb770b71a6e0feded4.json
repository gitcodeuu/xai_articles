  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A severely injured Asian black bear, previously used for baiting in Jauharabad, Punjab, was rescued and relocated to Islamabad’s Animal Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre by a team from Four Paws International on Sunday.\n\nThe seven-year-old bear, named Rocky by the rescuers, had suffered extensive injuries after being forced into 35 fights. Confiscated by Punjab Wildlife authorities on February 27, his condition was deemed critical, necessitating urgent medical attention.\n\nThe operation by a team, led by Dr Amir Khalil, was carried out in coordination with the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) and Punjab Wildlife Department.\n\nThe rescue mission spanned multiple locations, from Vienna to Lahore, then Jauharabad, before finally reaching Islamabad.\n\nDr Khalil, from Four Paws and now a well-known figure in Pakistan’s animal welfare efforts, highlighted the severity of Rocky’s injuries.\n\n“He was in a terrible state with multiple bleeding wounds on his face and back.\n\n“The videos we received showed the brutal nature of bear baiting, where he was repeatedly attacked by dogs,” he said.\n\nUpon arrival at the rescue centre, Dr Khalil and Dr Marina Ivanova conducted a two-hour medical procedure to treat Rocky.\n\nHis wounds were cleaned and disinfected and a painful nose pin was removed.\n\n“We are relieved that Rocky is now safe. He will be kept under observation before being introduced to other rescued bears,” Dr Khalil added.\n\nGiven Rocky’s traumatic past, the team stressed the importance of gradual rehabilitation.\n\n“Since he has only known violence, it will take time for him to adjust before he can socialise with other bears,” Dr Amir Khalil explained.\n\nThe rescue was praised by government officials, including the Punjab Wildlife Department and IWMB.\n\nFour Paws team members Pia Einheimler, Hristo Vladeve and local advocate Owais Awan expressed gratitude for the support they received.\n\nCoordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Romina Khurshid Alam along with IWMB Chairperson Aisha Humaira visited the rescue centre to commend the efforts of the Four Paws team.\n\nRocky was, according to a statement from IWMB, the third bear to be rescued in the past year, marking another victory in Pakistan’s fight against illegal wildlife exploitation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025",
