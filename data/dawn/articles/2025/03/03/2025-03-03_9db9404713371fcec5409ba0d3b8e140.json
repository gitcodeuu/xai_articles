  "content": "LAHORE: FIFA on Sunday informed the Pakistan Football Federation (PFF) that it was lifting the suspension placed on the country’s football governing body last month.\n\nThe suspension was lifted after the PFF Congress accepted the constitutional amendments proposed by the global body at its extraordinary meeting this week.\n\nThe lifting of the suspension clears the way for Pakistan to participate in the 2027 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers with the national team due to face Syria in its Group ‘E’ opener on March 25.\n\nThe Asian Football Confederation had earlier told the PFF that it will consider Pakistan to have withdrawn from the qualifiers if the suspension wasn’t lifted before March 4.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025",
