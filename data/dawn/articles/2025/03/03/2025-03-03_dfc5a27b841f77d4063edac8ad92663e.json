Today, there are upwards of 70 languages spoken in Pakistan, but English remains an official state language alongside the lingua franca Urdu, and they mingle in daily usage.\n\nSchools often still teach English with verbose colonial-era textbooks. “The adaptation of English as the main language is definitely a relation to the colonial era,” PSA youth programme director Tariq Pervez said.\n\n“That is our main link”.\n\nThe English of Pakistani officialdom remains steeped in anachronistic words. The prime minister describes militant attacks as “dastardly”, state media dubs protesters “miscreants”, and the military denounces its “nefarious” adversaries.\n\nBecoming fluent in the loquacious lingo of Pakistani English remains aspirational because of its association with the upper echelons.\n\nIn Pakistan, more than a third of children between the ages of five and 16 are out of school — a total of nearly 26 million, according to the 2023 census. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif declared an “education emergency” last year to address the stark figures.\n\n“People are interested in Scrabble because they can get opportunities for scholarships in universities or for jobs because it provides the vocab,” said Asher’s sister, Manaal.\n\nBut the 14-year-old reigning female number one in Pakistan warned: “You’ve got to be resilient otherwise Scrabble isn’t right for you.” In the Karachi hotel, Scrabble — invented in the 1930s during America’s Great Depression by an unemployed architect — is an informal training programme for success in later life.\n\n“The main language of learning is English,” said Pervez.\n\n“This game has a great pull,” he added. “The demand is so big. So many kids want to play, we don’t have enough resources to accommodate all of them.”\n\nAt the youngest level, the vocabulary of the players is more rudimentary: toy, tiger, jar, oink.\n\nBut professional Scrabble coach Waseem Khatri earns 250,000 rupees ($880) a month — nearly seven times the minimum wage — coaching some 6,000 students across Karachi’s school system to up their game.\n\nIn Pakistani English parlance, “they try to express things in a more beautiful way — in a long way to express their feelings,” said 36-year-old Khatri.\n\n“We try to utilise those words also in Scrabble.” But when Asher wins he is overwhelmed with joy, and those long words don’t come so easily. “I cannot describe the feeling,” he says.",
