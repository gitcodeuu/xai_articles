Our space is exclusively meant for goods. Also, we were worried about the health risks that these animals might pose to our staff,” another customs official explained and added the situation forced the department to hand over the animals to a non-profit animal welfare organisation — ACF Animal Rescue.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that the delay in coordination led to the death of two monkeys. It’s the first time in the city’s history that rescued animals couldn’t find shelter at a government facility,” an official shared with Dawn.\n\nIn the past, he pointed out, the species recovered from illegal shipments were handed over to the Karachi zoo.\n\nDawn tried to reach out to Ayesha Chundrigar of the ACF Animal Rescue, but to no avail.\n\nHowever, the NGO uploaded a video on their Facebook page and posted that the at the customs warehouse the monkeys “were sticking their hands out of the cages begging for food they were traumatised and starving, travelling for days in the coffin-like carriers”.\n\n“So we quickly took them away to a quiet place. And they finally calmed down once they started eating. As we fed them, we quickly took grills from the Cat enclosure that we are building at our new sanctuary to quickly make a makeshift enclosure for them until we can build them a bigger one where we can rehabilitate them like a holding facility before we send them off to a sanctuary abroad closest to their natural habitat,” it said, asking to donate for their rehabilitation facility.\n\nWildlife dept denies delay\n\nResponding to concerns, Sindh Wild­life Conservator Javed Ahmed Mahar claimed that there had been no delay in response on part of the department.\n\n“The customs department was informed in writing that the illegal animal consignment is required [under the new law, the Sindh Wildlife Protection, Preservation, Conservation and Management Act 2020] to be returned to the exporting country through the same airline which brought it. Airlines under the international law have the responsibility to verify documents from the related country prior to animal transport,” he explained.\n\nHe stated that apparently the customs department couldn’t fulfil this requirement and the department later came to know (through the social media) that the animals had been handed over to an animal welfare organisation.\n\nThe customs officials said that a case had been registered and criminal proceedings had been initiated.\n\nThey said that for guidelines the department had contacted the federal ministry of climate change, which managed the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). This included the issuing of documents for the export and import of wildlife.\n\nWhen asked about the animals’ custody, the wildlife official said: “We have no information whether they are captive breed or caught from the wild. Since the case is in the customs’ court, we cannot interfere in case property as of now.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025",
