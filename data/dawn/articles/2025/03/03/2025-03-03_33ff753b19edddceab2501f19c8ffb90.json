  "content": "LAHORE: The population of the Asiatic black bear is declining in Pakistan and its status on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List is classified as ‘vulnerable’. Without effective measures to curb trafficking and its use for bear baiting and begging, this species faces the risk of extinction in the country.\n\nIn a crackdown on wildlife trafficking, the Punjab Wildlife & Parks Department, under the leadership of Director General Mudasir Riaz Malik, has confiscated an Asiatic black bear from gypsy nomads residing near the boundary of Jhang and Chiniot districts.\n\nOne offender was arrested and would be presented before the court on Monday. The rescued female bear is receiving veterinary care at the Wildlife Breeding Centre in Jhang and will later be relocated to another wildlife facility.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025",
