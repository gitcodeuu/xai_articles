Clearly, his resignation underscored the dissatisfaction in legal circles over recent judicial appointments.\n\nSetback for ‘pro-govt’ Independent Group in recent high court bar elections lays bare lawyers’ grouse over 26th amendment, recent judicial appointments\n\nOwing to the sensitivity of the situation, Mr Bhoon came forward to replace Mr Hussain in the JCP.\n\nFederal Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, a key figure in the Independent Group, had actively participated in the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) elections on Oct 30, 2024.\n\nBroad changes\n\nThese elections are being seen as a referendum of sorts on the 26th Amendment, which brought sweeping changes to the process of appointing the judges, including new criteria for judicial induction, elevation, and promotions. The amendment also restructured the JCP by increasing the number of government members in it, thereby giving the executive a greater role in making appointments.\n\nFollowing these changes, the JCP oversaw new appointments in the Islamabad High Court, Lahore High Court, Sindh High Court, Peshawar High Court, and Balochistan High Court.\n\nMoreover, seven high court judges were elevated to the Supreme Court. However, the transfer of three judges from different high courts to the IHC triggered strong opposition, as it disrupted the traditional seniority structure.\n\nThe Islamabad Bar Association fiercely opposed these transfers, particularly the appointment of Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar as the IHC’s acting chief justice.\n\nMany lawyers saw it as a politically motivated decision that sidelined the candidates who deserved to be considered for the position on the basis of seniority.\n\nDespite being confident of success in the Feb 22 elections, the Independent Group suffered defeats. The group had backed candidates who spent millions of rupees on extravagant campaigns, including lavish high tea, luncheons and dinners to woo voters. Obviously, the results brought disappointment to them.\n\nAbdul Wahid Qureshi, who contested for the post of IHCBA’s president as a candidate of Independent Group, had been optimistic when he launched his campaign a year ago. He admitted that recent judicial appointments had turned the tide against him.\n\n“Everything was going perfectly, but tables were turned all of a sudden,” he lamented.\n\nPML-N’s role\n\nThe results from LHCBA’s registry in Rawalpindi were also unexpected, where the PML-N Lawyers Forum openly went against the candidate backed by Mr Bhoon’s group.\n\nKhurram Masood Kiani, backed by the Independent Group, lost the contest for the office of president of LHCBA Rawalpindi registry because the PML-N’s Lawyers Forum supported his opponent Ahsan Hameed Lillah of Professional Group.\n\nInsiders said that PML-N Lawyers Forum, Rawalpindi chapter, was not happy with recent appointments to the LHC.\n\nAccording to them, lawyers belonging to the PML-N Forum were ignored as government members in the JCP and key leaders of the Independent Group preferred their associates and, in some cases, close relatives to make nominations for top judicial appointments.\n\nIn some cases, even names of influential local leaders of PML-N Lawyers Forum were dropped by the headhunt committee led by the law minister.\n\nA leader of PML-N Lawyers Forum, Mohammad Siddiq Awan, topped the JCP’s list of candidates hoping to be appointed as judge of the LHC. However, his name was removed by the leadership of the Independent Group.\n\n‘No surprises’\n\nFor some, the result of the LHCBA election was not entirely out of the blue.\n\nShafqat Chohan, a PBC member from the Professional Group, said that the Independent Group’s earlier defeat in the Lahore District Bar Association elections had already set the stage.\n\n“They formed committees and received millions in funds, yet these committees failed to deliver,” he remarked.\n\nThe results indicate that the Independent Group’s traditional dominance of bar associations could be under threat. Indeed, if this trend continues, it could significantly impact their influence in the PBC elections scheduled for October 2025. PBC elections are held every five years.\n\nWhile Haroon Rashid, a former PBC vice chairman and member of the Independent Group, attempted to downplay his group’s defeats, calling them routine election results, many within the group fear an even bigger challenge in the months ahead.\n\n“When elections happen, one side wins and the other loses,” Mr Rashid stated, conceding that “internal divisions among local lawyers contributed to our defeat.”\n\nWith PBC elections expected in October, all eyes will be on whether the Independent Group can recover from these setbacks, or some new legal faction will rise to prominence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 3rd, 2025",
