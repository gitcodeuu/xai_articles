Snowfall and rain also continued across the northern region of KP and Gilgit-Baltistan, paralysing life in the area.\n\nAccording to the report, a copy of which is available with Dawn.com, the dead include three men and one woman, while four children, three women and two men sustained injuries.\n\n“A total of 14 houses were damaged due to the rains, of which 10 were partially damaged and three houses were completely destroyed,” the report stated.\n\nAccidents due to rains occurred in the districts of Haripur, Battagram, Bajaur, Upper and Lower Kohistan, Dir, Hangu, Khyber, and Torghar in the province, the report said.\n\n“PDMA has directed the concerned district administration to provide immediate assistance to the affected family and ensure the provision of best medical facilities to the injured,” a statement from the spokesperson said.\n\nPDMA has directed all district administrations and relevant institutions to utilise all resources to open the highways closed due to rain and snowfall. The organisation is in constant contact with all district administrations, relevant and relief agencies, the statement added.\n\nEarlier in the week, the Pakistan Meteorological Department forecast heavy rainfall across parts of Pakistan at the beginning of Ramazan. According to the department, intense rainfall and snowfall are expected in mountainous areas on Sunday and Monday (March 2 and 3).\n\nPunjab will experience heavy downpours. Murree, Galiyat, and other hilly areas are also likely to receive rain and snow, while Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s plains and mountainous regions will see rain and snowfall until Tuesday.\n\nDuring the monsoon season last year, which typically continues from July to August, at least 96 people died and 133 were injured in rain-related incidents across KP.\n\nMajor roads in the province, including the Karakoram Highway (KKH), were also blocked today due to landslides as torrential rain and snowfall continued to lash parts of the region.\n\nUpper Kohistan Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) Khuram Rehman Jadoon told Dawn.com that a 100-metre portion of the KKH had caved in near Shal bypass in Dasu earlier today.\n\nHe said the KKH was also blocked in the Shetial area of Upper Kohistan due to a landslide.\n\n“The KKH has been completely disconnected for all types of traffic plying between Islamabad and Gilgit-Baltistan and Upper Kohistan areas.\n\n“We appeal to people who are on the way or planning to travel to GB to immediately cancel their plans before they get into trouble,” the ADC said.\n\nHe added that stranded passengers would be asked to leave the area once the rain stopped as travelling on the KKH during showers was dangerous owing to boulders falling on the road. Jadoon said the public would be informed once the road was opened for traffic.\n\nMeanwhile, Shahrukh Ali Khan, the director general of Galiyat Development Authority (GDA), said that the region had experienced its heaviest snowfall of the winter season last night, beginning around Sehri.\n\nSo far, the region had received approximately 12 to 16 inches of snow, and the snowfall was still ongoing, he said.\n\n“GDA field staff and machinery began snow clearance operations early this morning, and efforts are still underway to ensure smooth road access for tourists and locals,” he said.\n\n“The GDA Control Room remains active to assist tourists in case of any emergency. Tourists are advised to follow safety guidelines and stay updated on weather and road conditions before travelling to the region,” he said.",
