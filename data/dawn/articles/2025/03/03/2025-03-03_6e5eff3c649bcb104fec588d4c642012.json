  "content": "KARACHI: Despite tall claims by the price regulator to deal with overcharging retailers with an iron fist, consumers faced the same challenging situation, like previous years, on the first day of Ramazan when they went to market to purchase food items for Iftar and Sehri.\n\nEven though rates of almost all food essentials have been fixed by the commissioner of Karachi, shopkeepers in the metropolis were selling all the items on exorbitant prices spoiling consumers’ appetite.\n\nFruit vendors were charging Rs250-300 per dozen for bananas. The official rate was Rs148 a dozen.\n\nMelons and guavas (Larkana) were selling at Rs150-200 and Rs200-250, compared to an official rate of Rs86 and Rs130 per kg.\n\nShopkeepers brazenly flout price list issued by commissioner for Ramazan; govt claims arrest of 14 profiteers\n\nThe official rates of apple (Golden) and (Kullu) were Rs219 and Rs158 per kg, but these varieties were hardly available anywhere at the official rates as retailers were demanding Rs300-400 and Rs250-300 per kg, respectively for them.\n\nWatermelon price has been fixed at Rs69 per kg. But was sold at Rs150 per kg.\n\nOranges were being sold at Rs500 per dozen against its official rate of Rs386.\n\nVegetables\n\nThe official prices of highly running items like onion and potato (new) were fixed at Rs58 and Rs52, but the retailers were making handsome profits by selling them at Rs70-100 and Rs80 per kg respectively.\n\nTomato prices, which have crashed this year, were hovering around at Rs100 for three kilos. Two weeks back it was sold at Rs100 for five kilos. The commissioner has fixed its rate at Rs23 per kg but it is available at Rs50-60 per kg in the market.\n\nShimla Mirch (capsicum), Palak (spinach) and Band Gobhi (cabbage) carry official rates of Rs115, Rs35 and Rs40 per kg. However, people are paying Rs200, Rs80-100 and Rs100-120 per kg, respectively, for these items.\n\nGreen chilli (big) is sold at Rs150-200 per kg against its official rate of Rs115 per kg.\n\nGreen onion is sold at Rs150-200 per kilo against its official rate of Rs115 per kg.\n\nBakery and confectionery items\n\nThe price of ‘Class A’ Khajla and Pheni has been fixed at Rs800 per kg. However, the retailers are selling these ‘Class A’ items at the rate of Rs1,271-1,600 per kg.\n\nJalebi (Class A) price has been set at Rs500 per kg, but it is sold at Rs700-880 per kg.\n\nThe retail price of flour No 2.5, which is largely used by tandoor operators, and fine flour have been fixed at Rs87 and Rs92 per kg, but consumers are paying Rs100-110 and Rs120 per kg for them.\n\nThe official prices of beef (veal) with and without bones are Rs1,000 and Rs1,050 per kg, but consumers are unable to find them in markets at these rates.\n\nVeal meat with bone is sold at Rs1,300-1,400 while boneless cost Rs1,600-1,700 per kg.\n\nThe commissioner’s teams did not even bother to check the increase of rates just a few days ahead of Ramazan.\n\nMutton rates have also been increased by Rs100 per kg prior to Ramazan as it is now available at Rs2,200-2,400 per kg as against its official rate of Rs2,000 per kg.\n\nIt is despite the fact that the mutton consumption goes down during the holy month.\n\nThe official retail rates of broiler live bird and its meat (without giblets) have been fixed at Rs420 and Rs650 per kg while people are paying Rs520-540 and Rs700-720 per kg. It is seen that a number of retailers were not even hesitating in demanding up to Rs800 per kg for the meat.\n\nGrocery items\n\nThe official rate of high-quality Kabuli Channa, black gram and Basin were Rs350, Rs255 and Rs275, but consumers were struggling to find these items at the control rates.\n\nIn retail markets, Kabuli Channa, black gram and Basin were sold at Rs400-450, Rs280-320 and Rs320-350 per kg.
