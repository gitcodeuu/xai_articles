The JIT decided that strict action would be taken against those, who are not appearing before it.\n\nThe sources said that during the proceedings, the JIT members asked questions about social media posts against the army and other institutions.\n\nThe JIT was formed by the federal government to probe malicious campaigns on social media for allegedly creating chaos and disorder in the country. It had summoned 10 individuals, most of them members of the PTI’s social media team, to Friday’s hearing.\n\nThe notices, issued under Section 160 of CrPC by the office of the inspector general of police, Islamabad, said the competent authority had directed that the atten­dance notices be sent through direct messenger, by post, via fax and through the PTI Secretariat.\n\n“The JIT is investigating the matter to determine the objectives of the accused and their accomplices who have created chaos and disorder in Pakistan through malicious social media campaigns,” read the official notices.\n\nIt may be recalled that former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser said on Thursday that PTI had already rejected the Peca Act.\n\n“We have decided to challenge the amendments to it, so how can we allow our workers and leaders to appear before the JIT,” said the PTI leader, adding that everyone had the right to express his point of view and “PTI rejects such JITs”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 8th, 2025",
