Subsequently, he was arrested by Dallas Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) on January 31, following a routine traffic stop.\n\nRizvi had entered the US legally on Sept 20, 2017 near the New York port of entry and violated the terms of his admission, ICE stated.\n\nThe ICE department provided a helpline on which US residents could contact to report crimes and suspicious activity, or they could fill out an online form.",
