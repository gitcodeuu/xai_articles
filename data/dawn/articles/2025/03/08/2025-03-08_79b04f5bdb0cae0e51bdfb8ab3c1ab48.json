The most important thing is the way we’ve played throughout this competition.\n\n“The hunger, the commitment and the eagerness to try and do something special for the country is always there.”\n\nWith Mohammed Shami filling in superbly for injured pacer Jasprit Bumrah and all-rounder Hardik Pandya offering valuable batting depth, Rohit was delighted with the form of key players going into the title decider.\n\n“When you want to play in the final, you want all your guys to be in form,” he said.\n\n“All of these guys have made an impact whenever they’ve got an opportunity and that gives us a lot of confidence.”\n\nDespite their flawless displays in Dubai, India will not take anything for granted against New Zealand, who beat them by four wickets in the final of the 2000 event when it was named the ICC KnockOut Trophy.\n\nNew Zealand batsman Kane Williamson said his side have every chance of derailing India in a major final once again.\n\n“Obviously, it was a long time ago and a great victory for our country,” said Williamson, whose side also stunned India in the World Test Championship title clash four years ago.\n\n“Here, now, lots of things are different […] we’ll be changing our focus quickly to this next match, which is an exciting opportunity for us.”\n\nWhile India will be more comfortable with the venue, having played all their games in Dubai, Williamson said anything can happen in a final.\n\n“It was a great atmosphere in the last game, and I’m sure it’ll be a good one again,” he added.\n\nNew Zealand head into the match having thumped South Africa in the semi-final after registering the highest Champions Trophy total of 362-6, with Rachin Ravindra and Williamson in fine fettle after scoring centuries.\n\nTheir capable spin unit, comprising captain Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell, Glenn Phillips and Ravindra, can cause plenty of problems for India, who will aim to move ahead of Australia in the Champions Trophy winners list.\n\nAustralia won the event in 2006 and 2009.\n\nNew Zealand will hope to have Matt Henry fully fit after the pace bowler injured his shoulder against South Africa.\n\n“Obviously, the surface will dictate a bit of how we want to operate,” said Santner, whose side were undone by India’s four-pronged spin attack last time around.\n\n“It might be a little bit slower than what we’re going to get in Lahore. So it might be more of a scrap.\n\n“But we’re down to scrap.”\n\nMeanwhile, opener Shubman Gill said. India’s hunger for a global title remained undiminished but there would be no desperation when they clashed with New Zealand.\n\nIndia ended an 11-year global title drought when they won the Twenty20 World Cup in West Indies last year under Sharma’s captaincy.\n\nStopping that barren run has allowed them to play the big matches like Sunday’s final without getting overwhelmed by the occasion, said 25-year-old Gill.\n\n“Sometimes once you get one title, I think that kind of breaks the jinx,” he told reporters at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on the eve of the final.\n\n“It gives you the momentum, also you are not very desperate about getting the title. It’s not good when desperation kicks in. Then it becomes hard to put the occasion out of the equation.\n\n“In all these big matches, the players or the teams that can put aside the pressure and take the occasion out of the game have a better chance of winning.\n\n“I think winning the title in 2024 doesn’t mean that we are less hungry but I think it makes us more balanced that yes we’ve won an ICC title and we’ll try to do our best to win this one.”\n\nIndia have been boosted by Kohli’s return to form and the firepower in their middle order.\n\n“I think this is the best batting lineup that I have been part of,” Gill said. “Rohit and Virat are all-time one-day greats. Rohit is one of the best openers in white ball and Virat is one of the best ODI batsmen ever.\n\n“The batting depth that we have has made life easier for the top order batsmen. Those of us in the top order play with so much freedom because of our batting depth.”",
