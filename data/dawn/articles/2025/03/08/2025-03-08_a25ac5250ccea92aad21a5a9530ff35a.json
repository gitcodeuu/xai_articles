They agreed that Lal Masjid administration would demolish the under-construction building along with a boundary wall and a gate adjacent to the mosque. A wall will be built along the specified boundary of the mosque.\n\nTalks will be held after Eidul Fitr regarding the remaining under-construction buildings after which there will be a complete ban on any kind of construction.\n\nThe Lal Masjid administration promised that no pressure, force or influence would be used against any government or public institution, officials or the general public. Moreover, no one would create a law and order situation.\n\nMoreover, Ume Hassan will not interfere in government and institutional matters. If such interference was found, immediate legal action would be taken.\n\nHate speeches against the state and its armed forces and the use of print and social media for this purpose are a crime. Strict legal action will be initiated against all such acts, including inciting public for terrorism and spreading religious or sectarian hatred.\n\nBoth sides will negotiate over the matter of Lal Masjid after Eidul Fitr and sign an agreement for a permanent solution to the issue.\n\nIt was also agreed that the terms and conditions listed in the agreement would be unconditionally followed to maintain rule of law and ensure law and order in the city.\n\nThe deputy commissioner Islamabad could not be contacted for comments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 8th, 2025",
