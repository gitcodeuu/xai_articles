Locals did not have to be evacuated.\n\nMatthieu Chabanel, head of rail infrastructure management unit SNCF Reseau, said that finding a bomb of such size was “really quite exceptional”.\n\n“We know that during World War II, the rail network was heavily bombed, especially here north of Paris where there were also many factories,” he told reporters.\n\n“So we are particularly vigilant when we carry out work in this area and we detect an abnormal situation, which is what happened last night,” he said, adding that police teams were immediately notified.\n\nSud-Rail unionist Fabien Villedieu posted a picture of the ordnance covered in dirt.\n\nIt was not immediately clear when and by who the bomb was dropped during World War II and if it dated to before or after the 1940 occupation of Paris by Germany.\n\n‘It’s impossible’\n\nMany passengers could not mask their irritation at the sudden change of plans.\n\n“I’ve been waiting since 6am for a train to Goussainville,” said 55-year-old Corinne Schiavenato, referring to a town north of Paris.\n\n“I tried to take a replacement bus, but it’s impossible, too many passengers, they’re packed. I’m self-employed, I have a client who has been waiting for me since 7am.” Others took the disruptions in stride.\n\n“It’s funny, I’ve just come back from Lorient where unexploded shells are discovered all the time,” said Chloe Ternand, referring to a town in western France.\n\nPart of the Paris ring road and a motorway were closed to traffic due to the demining operations.\n\n‘I was shocked’\n\nEurostar urged passengers to change their journey “for a different date”.\n\n“Traffic is completely halted to and from Gare du Nord. As a result, all Eurostar trains are cancelled to and from Paris today,” affecting the routes to London and Brussels, the cross-Channel operator said.\n\nIts services from London to Brussels and London to Amsterdam, which do not go via Paris, were running normally, it added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 8th, 2025",
