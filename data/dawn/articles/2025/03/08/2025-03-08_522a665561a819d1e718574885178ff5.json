In the new set-up, Musadik Malik has became Minister for Cli­mate Change & Environ­mental Coordi­nation. The portfolios of other existing federal ministers have remained mostly unchanged.\n\nExpansion & law\n\nFollowing the Feb 27 expansion in the cabinet, 12 federal ministers and nine ministers of state were sworn in by President Asif Ali Zardari. Three advisers and four special assistants to the prime minister were also inducted.\n\nThe size of the cabinet doubled, increasing its members from 21 to 43, including 30 federal ministers, nine ministers of state and four advisers. Most of the newly inducted members belong to the ruling PML-N, but allied parties also got their share.\n\nAccording to Article 92 of the Constitution, no more than one-fourth of federal ministers and ministers of state can be from the Senate, and the total size of the cabinet cannot exceed 11pc of the total parliamentary membership.\n\nAt present, the National Assembly and Senate have 336 and 96 members, respectively, totalling 432.\n\nHaving a hefty federal cabinet is not a new phenomenon, as almost all previous regimes had claimed they would keep its size small, but later packed their cabinets.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 8th, 2025",
