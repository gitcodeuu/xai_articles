He said there were some ‘petty issues’ between friends, which led to the murder.\n\n“We have collected evidence to the murder case while other crimes like narcotics, money laundering, etc, are being investigated by other institutions,” said the provincial police chief, adding that the police’s focus was on the primary case and collection of its evidence.\n\nHe hinted at the possibility that separate cases would be registered against the main accused, Armaghan, as investigations moved further in narcotics, money laundering etc.\n\nMeanwhile, an official statement issued by the IG police spokesperson said the participants were given a briefing by Sindh police, FIA and excise department about the progress made so far in the Mustafa Amir murder case and actions against narcotics.\n\nIG police Ghulam Nabi Memon, DIG CIA Muqaddas Haider, ANF’s Brig Imran Ali, director FIA Noman Siddiqi and secretary excise Saleem Rajput shared necessary details about the Mustafa Amir murder case and issues related to it like money laundering, drug mafias and other crimes. The lawmakers exchanged views about different aspects of the murder case, other factors and decided to seek more answers and necessary details from institutions in the next meeting.\n\nThe lawmakers directed the institutions for coordination among them and submit concrete evidence and comprehensive strategy in the next meeting of the NA’s body.\n\n‘Problems’ in inquiry\n\nSources privy to the meeting also told Dawn that the NA body raised a host of questions and concerns, particularly as to why the FIA was taking so much time in completing the inquiry into the money laundering charges.\n\nThey also asked as to what actions had been taken by the police authorities against the policemen, specifically an officer posted in the CIA who is said to be close relative of main accused Armaghan, as a video of his had been leaked.\n\nThe sources said that the meeting participants were informed that 18 computers/laptops had been recovered from the possession of Armaghan.\n\nThe FIA officials were quoted as having said that they were facing “problems” in the inquiry as they needed the personal laptop and two mobile phones of Armaghan for inquiry.\n\nThe FIA contended that they were not being provided access to the data despite the fact that the police did not have expertise in such matters.\n\nThe police responded to this by saying that they could provide this data (laptop, cell phones) through the intervention of court since it was the case property.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 8th, 2025",
