He appeared at Birmingham’s crown court where he was sentenced after admitting to the crime, the statement added.\n\nThe officers found voice notes on Yasir’s phone showing evidence of a contact with a Pakistani supplier with access to the manufacturer of firearms’ parts.\n\nThe statement further said that Yasir was suspected of a similar incident in Nov 2023. It stated, “Evidence also showed that during 2023, Khan purchased several deactivated firearms which it is believed he was able to convert into viable lethal firearms once again.”\n\nA video posted by the agency on social media platform X showed armed officers raiding the accused who was seen sitting inside a car. The officers detained him with handcuffs, the footage showed.",
