  "content": "ISLAMABAD: City managers on Wednesday decided to transform sections of Blue Area and Jinnah Super Market into car-free zones, turning them into pedestrian-only streets and setting up food outlets.\n\nIf all goes as planned, the Capital Development Authority will convert a portion of Blue Area into a car-free zone from the new parking site to the Khyber Plaza area (G-7 and F-7 portion of Blue Area). The civic body further said that it would also start an electric cart service for the public to enable them to travel in and out of the designated area.\n\n“Our parking plaza in Blue Area is in its final stages and will become operational soon. People will park their vehicles in this facility before entering the pedestrian street,” an official of the CDA said.\n\nHe said 950 vehicles can be parked in the parking plaza simultaneously.\n\nCDA chairman directs that Blue Area parking plaza be made operational before pedestrian track is constructed\n\n“The walk-and-shop type pedestrian street would be set up in around 800-metre area from the parking plaza to the Khyber Plaza area.\n\nIn the first phase, it would be established on Jinnah Avenue side and later on, it will be expanded,“ the official said, adding that three small pedestrian areas would be developed in Jinnah Super Market, including Gol Market Area.\n\nHe said the decision to make car-free areas was taken in a meeting held at the CDA headquarters with CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa in the chair.\n\n“During the meeting, a briefing was given on the establishment of pedestrian tracks in Blue Area (G-7/F-7) and setting up of food stalls on weekends,” read a statement issued after the meeting.\n\nThe meeting decided that “high-quality, well-designed pathways would be constructed for pedestrians in the Blue Area,” the statement said.\n\nIt further said the relevant CDA officials, while briefing the meeting, said electric carts would be introduced for the elderly and children, and food stalls of top chains would be set up on the pedestrian track on weekends.\n\nThe CDA chairman directed that the Blue Area parking plaza be made operational before the pedestrian track is constructed.\n\nHe also ordered that recreational facilities, along with food stalls, should be arranged in the pedestrian area, adding that digital screens be installed at the entry and exit points of the pedestrian track in Blue Area.\n\nThe meeting also decided that uniformity would be brought to the design of signboards displayed outside shops in Blue Area and benches and separate trash bins would be placed along the pedestrian track, keeping in mind the convenience of visitors.\n\nThe CDA chief directed that a high-standard cleanliness system should be ensured at all times in these areas.\n\nHe stated that the facade of buildings in Islamabad’s Blue Area should be improved.\n\nWhen contacted, CDA’s spokesperson Shahid Kiani said that the engineering wing had been directed to start work on finalising estimates for pedestrian tracks.\n\n“Pedestrian tracks would be developed with modern and attractive designs,” he added.\n\nWhen asked how the traders’ community would react, Mr Kiani said: “ We will take the traders’ community on board for this project. Apparently, they will have no issues as the project would increase visitors to the areas.“\n\nA portion of Jinnah Super Market would also be made a car-free zone, he said, adding that “both projects would be started soon.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
