Due to alleged negligence, the flames spread rapidly, engulfing the huts and trapping the children inside.\n\nNaziran Mai also suffered serious burns. The parents took the bodies of the deceased children to Rajanpur for burial.\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has expressed her condolences over the deaths.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
