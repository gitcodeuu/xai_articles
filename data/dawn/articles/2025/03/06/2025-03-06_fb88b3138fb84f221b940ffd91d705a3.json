A number of houses were also damaged by the mortars, they added.\n\nPakistani civilian injured amid mortar shelling\n\nWitnesses said that heavy weapons used by both sides mostly targeted checkpoints on the hilltops and military installations on each side. Some buildings on the Afghan side were also destroyed.\n\nThey said that guns fell silent on late Tuesday night, artillery restarted on Wednes­day noon and continued till the evening.\n\nMeanwhile, Jamaat-i-Islami leader Shah Faisal Afridi has called upon both Muslim neighbours to immediately stop fighting at Torkham and hold a dialogue to resolve the issue.\n\nAddressing a press conference at Landi Kotal Press Club on Wednesday, Mr Afridi ins­isted that use of force at the Torkham border was not a good omen for the collective peace of the region, as Muslim Pashtuns were the ultimate sufferers on both sides of the border.\n\nThe JI leader also criticised the PML-N-led federal and PTI-led provincial government for their silence over the deteriorating situation and pressed for a meaningful dialogue for ending the conflict.\n\nMr Afridi said that the tension at Torkham border was causing mental stress to traders and transporters, who were suffering huge losses due to persistent and repeated closure of the border.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
