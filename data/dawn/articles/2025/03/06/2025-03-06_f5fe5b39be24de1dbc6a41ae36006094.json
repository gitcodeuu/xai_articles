  "content": "QUETTA: Baloch Yakjehti Committee (BYC) central organiser Mahrang Baloch has demanded an immediate end to the arrest and alleged enforced disappearances of political activists, youths and members of civil society in the province.\n\nWhile criticising the official policy on the issue, she claimed at a presser on Tuesday that over 6,000 individuals had gone missing and many more had been allegedly abducted from Kalat and other areas recently.\n\n“If these individuals are not released immediately, BYC will block national highways and the government will be responsible for the consequences,” she warned.\n\nMs Baloch expressed concern over the situation, stating that the alleged fake encounters, targeted killings, etc, had turned Baloch people’s lives into a nightmare.\n\nShe alleged that four youth were killed in a staged encounter in Mashkay area while five others were extra-judicially killed last week. Similarly, two young men were killed in Gwadar. In response to these killings, she added, protests were held in Kech, Hub Chowki, Quetta, Mastung, and Khuzdar town.\n\nShe accused the government of exploiting Balochistan’s resources and subjecting its people to oppression and claimed that due to the government’s policies and action thousands of people had been displaced. However, she vowed, the Baloch will continue their struggle for rights.\n\nShe also accused Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and his government of attempting to suppress protests through threats and force, including violence against women protesters and their imprisonment. She termed these actions shameful and reiterated the BYC’s demand for an immediate and unconditional release of all who had been detained on false charges.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
