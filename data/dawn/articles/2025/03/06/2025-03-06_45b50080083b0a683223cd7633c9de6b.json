If you chose to go outside of that, you did so at your own risk, and today is when that reckoning comes,” he said.\n\nNonetheless, Trump’s social media post made no mention of a reprieve for Canada, the other party to the USMCA deal that Trump negotiated during his first term as president.\n\nLutnick said his “off the cuff” estimate was that more than 50pc of the goods imported from the two US neighbours — also its two largest trading partners — were compliant with the USMCA deal that Trump negotiated during his first term as president.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau called Lutnick’s comments “promising” in remarks to reporters in Canada.\n\n“That aligns with some of the conversations that we have been having with administration officials, but I’m going to wait for an official agreement to talk about Canadian response and look at the details of it,” Trudeau said.\n\n“But it is a promising sign. But I will highlight that it means that the tariffs remain in place, and therefore, our response will remain in place.”\n\nLutnick emphasised that the reprieve would only last until April 2, when he said the administration plans to move ahead with reciprocal tariffs under which the US would impose levies that match those imposed by trading partners.\n\nIn the meantime, he said, the current hiatus was about getting fentanyl deaths down, which was the initial justification Trump used for the tariffs on Mexico and Canada and levies on Chinese goods that have now risen to 20pc.\n\n“On April 2, we’re going to move with the reciprocal tariffs, and hopefully Mexico and Canada will have done a good enough job on fentanyl that this part of the conversation will be off the table, and we’ll move just to the reciprocal tariff conversation,” Lutnick said. “But if they haven’t, this will stay on.”\n\nIndeed, Trudeau expects the US and Canada to remain in a trade war.\n\n“I can confirm that we will continue to be in a trade war that was launched by the United States for the foreseeable future,” he told reporters in Ottawa.",
