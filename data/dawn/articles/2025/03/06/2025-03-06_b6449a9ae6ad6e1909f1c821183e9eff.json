  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Wednesday allowed more time to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) and the Punjab Home Department to furnish replies to petitions challenging the Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act, 2025.\n\nJustice Farooq Haider heard the petitions filed by Leader of the Opposition in the Punjab Assembly Ahmad Khan Bhachar and the journalists’ organisations.\n\nThe law officers of the federation and the province sought time to submit replies on behalf of the PTA and the home department.\n\nThe judge expressed his displeasure over non-submission of the replies but allowed another opportunity to the respondents to comply with the orders by March 13.\n\nThe petitions argue that the impugned law infringes upon multiple fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
