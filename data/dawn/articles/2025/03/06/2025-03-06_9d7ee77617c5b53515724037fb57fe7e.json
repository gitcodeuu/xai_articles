  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday ordered the production of Adeel Khan and his daughter Anita Maryam Khan on a petition seeking latter’s custody by the girl’s Polish mother, Anna Monica.\n\nJustice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani issued directives for both the father and daughter to appear before the court on the next date of hearing.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Adeel Khan’s lawyer argued that the court lacked jurisdiction as his client is a resident of Karachi. However, Justice Kayani emphasised that the Polish court is actively handling the case and that the girl was brought to Pakistan before the completion of legal proceedings there.\n\nThe father’s legal team also stated that no formal order for girls custody had been issued by the Polish court yet.\n\nJustice Kayani, however, insisted on the girl’s presence, stating that the court needed to ensure her well-being.\n\nThe court instructed that she should appear in person, to which her lawyer responded that she would be available after April 15. The court adjourned the hearing until April 22.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
