  "content": "The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) on Thursday notified a negative fuel cost adjustment (FCA) of Rs3 per unit for consumers of K-Electric in March’s bills on account of a variation in fuel charges for December.\n\nAccording to a notification issued by Nepra today, the authority “decided to allow negative FCA of Rs3/kWh to KE for the month of December 2024, to be passed on to the consumers in the billing month of March 2025”.\n\nNepra said the negative FCA would apply to “all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, domestic protected consumers, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS) and prepaid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for pre-paid tariff”.\n\nThe adjustment would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills on the basis of units billed to the consumers in the respective month to which the adjustment pertains, it said.\n\n“In case any bills of March 2025 are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in subsequent month,” the notification said.\n\nThe notification said that the negative FCA of Rs.3/kWh was being allowed on a “provisional basis subject to adjustment” once Nepra determined KE’s Multi-Year Tariff for FY2024-30. “The difference in cost, if any, based on the MYT FY 2024-30 would be allowed in future adjustments once the same is notified,” it added.\n\nSeparately, Nepra also notified a negative FCA of Rs.2.124 per unit following an adjustment on account of the variation in fuel charges for January in the approved tariff of ex-Wapda distribution companies (Discos).\n\nAccording to a notification issued today, the authority “has reviewed and assessed a National Average Uniform decrease of Rs2.124/kWh in the applicable tariff for Discos on account of variations in the fuel charges for January”.\n\nThe notification said that the FCA should apply to all the consumer categories except lifeline consumers, protected consumers, EVCS and pre-paid electricity consumers of all categories who opted for prepaid tariffs.\n\n“Discos shall reflect the fuel charges adjustment in respect of January 2025 in the billing month of March 2025,” the notification said, adding that it would be shown separately in the consumers’ bills based on units utilised in January.\n\n“In case any bills of March are issued before the notification of this decision, the same may be applied in subsequent month,” it said.",
