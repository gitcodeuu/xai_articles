We are building a more resilient and sustainable Sindh,” he added.\n\nHe said that the SSEP’s Component III would provide heavily subsidised SHS kits to eligible households for a nominal price of Rs6,000.\n\nEach VeraSol-certified kit includes robust solar panel (80w solar panel, smart power management, and a charge control unit, a long-lasting battery, an 18Ah lithium-iron phosphate battery, efficient lighting (three led bulbs), essential connectivity (mobile charging facility, 18-inch DC pedestal fan and secure installation (solar mounting frame).\n\nThe CM said that the provincial government was actively forging partnerships with Chinese companies to develop wind-solar hybrid energy projects, including a 350MW and a 75MW initiative, which were finalised during President Asif Ali Zardari’s recent visit to China.\n\nThe chief minister reiterated the government’s commitment to providing 300 units of free electricity to low-income families, a main promise of the PPP manifesto and a step towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n\nHe said that the provincial government aimed to complete the distribution of all 200,000 SHS kits by July 2025, with a target of 400 kits per district each week.\n\n“This ambitious timeline reflects the government’s urgency in delivering tangible benefits to communities in need,” he added.\n\nEnergy Minister Nasir Shah said that SHS distribution was being carried out equally across all 30 districts of the province, utilising the expertise of established NGOs like Hands, SRSO, and SAFCO to ensure efficient last-mile delivery.\n\nHe said that beneficiaries were carefully selected from the Benazir Income Support Program database, targeting families with a PMT score between 21 and 50, ensuring that the most vulnerable receive priority.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 6th, 2025",
