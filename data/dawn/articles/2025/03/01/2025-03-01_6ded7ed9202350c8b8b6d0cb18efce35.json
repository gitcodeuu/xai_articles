  "content": "LAHORE: Rain was predicted in the forecast. And, unf­ortunately, it came late in the evening and had the final say in deciding the result of the highly-anticipated clash betw­een Aus­tralia and Afghan­istan here at the Gaddafi Stadium on Friday.\n\nAs the match ended in no result, Australia became the third team to qualify for the ICC Champions Trophy with four points from three matches while Afghanistan are virtually out of the equation with three points from their three group ‘B’ games.\n\nThe second semi-finalist team from Group ‘B’ will be decided after Saturday’s game between England and South Africa in Karachi. From Group ‘A’, India and New Zealand have already reached the last-four stage.\n\nAustralia, the world champions, were racing towards the 274-run target — with 109-1 in 12.5 overs — when the umpires were forced to stop play due to heavy rain which continued for about half an hour. Efforts were made to dry the outfield with a machine before the cut-off time of 10:11pm but the umpires at around 8:50pm called off the match as the major part of the ground was still to be dried.\n\nAfter Afghanistan fielders dropped both openers, Matthew Short and a dangerous-looking Travis Head launched a full-fledged attack with the bat plundering 44 in just 4.4 overs. They must have kept in view the weather forecast and possible Duckworth-Lewis (D/L) method and related calculations.\n\nAfter cracking a 15-ball 20, Short was caught by Gulbadin Naib at mid-on off fast bowler Azmatullah Omarzai bringing the crowd, many among them Afghanistan spectators, to their feet. However, that was the only time the boisterous fans of Hashmatullah Shahidi and his men rejoiced under lights.\n\nThe departure of Short did not prevent Head from playing his typically aggressive game as captain Steve Smith joined left-hander. Australia cruised to 100 mark in just 12 overs as Head completed his 17th ODI half-century off only 34 balls. He remained not out on 59 off 40 balls with the help of nine fours and a six. Smith was unbeaten on 19 from 22 balls.\n\nAs left-arm wrist spinner Noor Ahmad was belted by Head for a four in the 13th over, heavy rain started to spoil the game which was never resumed.\n\nThe Afghanistan pacers proved expensive as Omarzai gave away 43 runs in five overs, while fellow pacer Fazalhaq Farooqi leaked 32 in three. Only Mohammad Nabi was economical (0-13 in three overs).\n\nEarlier, Afghanistan after electing to bat first posted a decent total in a virtually knockout clash.\n\nAfter losing Rahmanullah Gu­r­baz who was bowled for a duck by pacer Spencer Johnson in the first over of the innings, Sediqullah Atal alongside in-form opener Ibrahim Zadran added 67.\n\nAt 70-1 in the 14th over, Zadran (22) was sent back by leg-spinner Adam Zampa as the batter was caught by Marnus Labuschagne at backward point. Rahmat Shah was caught behind by wicket-keeper Josh Inglis for a 21-ball 12 off occasional spinner Glenn Maxwell.\n\nWhile Afghanistan kept losing wickets at one end — and could not develop a big partnership — Sediqullah with some solid strok­eplay kept the other end intact.\n\nThe 23-year-old left-hander smashed six fours and three sixes during his 95-ball 85 which was his second ODI fifty.\n\nAfter losing Rahmat at 91 in the 19th over, Sediqullah and Shahidi added 68 off 78 balls for the fourth wicket before the former was dismissed by Johnson as the batter looking to drive was caught in the cover by Smith. Shahidi after making a slower than normal 49-ball 20 was taken at backward square leg while attempting to sweep Zampa.\n\nSoon Nabi (one) was run out as Afghanistan crumbled to 182-6 in the 37th over and when Naib departed at the end of the 40th over the score read 199-7.\n\nOmarzai at this stage came to the rescue, playing a crucial role in making sure Afghanistan reach a fighting score.\n\nStriking five sixes during his 63-ball 67 — his eighth half-century — including three to pacer Nathan Ellis and one each to Matt Short and Zampa, Omarzai combined with tailenders Rashid Khan (17) and others to steer his team to safety as they collected 74 runs in the final 10 overs.\n\nOmarzai was finally dismissed in the last over by fast bowler Ben Dwarshuis as the right-hander trying an inside-out shot was caught at deep cover by Alex Carey.\n\nExtras, including 17 wides, contributed 37 runs.\n\nDwarshuis claimed three wickets for 47 in nine overs, Johnson grabbed 2-49 while Zampa snared two for 48 in eight overs. Maxwell conceded 28 runs in six overs for one wicket. Ellis conceded 60 for one.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nAFGHANISTAN:\n\nR. Gurbaz b Johnson 0\n\nI. Zadran c Labuschagne b Zampa 22\n\nS.
