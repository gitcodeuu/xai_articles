  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly on Friday approved a motion for the construction of a new assembly hall after razing the existing structure as per reports of Nespak and communication and works department.\n\nThe motion moved in the assembly session by Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said the existing hall of the Balochistan assembly was built some 38 years back and its condition had deteriorated over the years.\n\nAs no land is available in and around the Red Zone, the new hall and chamber should be constructed at alternative place near Nust and Sariab road area.\n\nFormer chief minister Dr Malik Baloch said that if the departments concerned had prepared any report about the assembly hall and chamber, the same should be presented before the house.\n\nCM Bugti said the government had the authority to take decision in this regard, and the issue was brought to the assembly to seek opinion of lawmakers.\n\nThe CM said the provincial government would not have to provide funds for the construction of assembly building.\n\nHowever, Maulana Hidayatur Rehman of JI opposed the new building and said that it was not to spend Rs5 billion in a province where mortality rate of mother and child was the highest.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
