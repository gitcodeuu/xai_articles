  "content": "DHAKA: Bangladeshi students who played a key role in overthrowing the government last year unveiled a new political party on Friday, the latest outfit to join the fray ahead of expected elections.\n\nThe party includes key organisers from the powerful Students Against Discri­mination (SAD) group that spearheaded the uprising which ousted iron-fisted former prime minister Sheikh Hasina in August.\n\nThe new Jatiya Nagarik Party, or National Citizens Party in English, kickstarted its journey in front of parliament on Friday, joined by thousands of supporters who wore green-and-red bandanas, the colours of Bangladesh’s national flag.\n\nNahid Islam, a former adviser to the interim government, is leading the new political party as the convener, while Akhtar Hossain will be the secretary. Nahid said the new party would be a “democratic, egalitarian, people’s party”.\n\n“A second republic is now the need of the hour. And for this we need the constituent assembly election first,” he said.\n\nAkhtar Hossain said their party would strive to attain “social justice, and human dignity”.\n\n“The youth want a new constitution, and the context is now set,” Akhtar said.\n\nOrganisers also screened documentaries depicting the events that led to the end of Sheikh Hasina’s rule.\n\nAmong the attendees was Mohammad Shahin Alam, 37, who lost his teenaged son during the uprising.\n\nAlam said he hoped the new party would ensure “justice for bereaved families”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
