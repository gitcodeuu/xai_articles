The IED was detonated remotely as the FC vehicle, which was on routine patrol, approached the location.\n\nFollowing the powerful explosion, police and FC personnel rushed to the scene and shifted the injured to Civil Hospital Quetta. “We have received nine injured people at the hospital,” Dr Wasim Baig told Dawn, adding that the condition of two victims was critical.\n\nThe blast caused significant damage to the FC vehicle and shattered windowpanes of nearby shops and buildings.\n\nSenior police officer Anwar Ali Khan confirmed that the FC vehicle was the intended target of the attack.\n\nHe said that around 3kg of explosives were used in the IED, which was detonated using a remote control.\n\nNo group immediately claimed responsibility for the attack. The Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) has registered a case against unidentified suspects and an investigation is underway.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
