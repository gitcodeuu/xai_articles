  "content": "KARACHI: On the eve of England’s dead-rubber Champions Trophy clash against South Africa, Jos Buttler’s resignation as white-ball captain dominated headlines on Friday, marking a poignant end to a turbulent two-year reign.\n\nThe match, set for Satu­rday at Karachi’s National Bank Stadium, now carries the weight of an era’s closure for England, while South Africa eye a top-of-the-group finish to secure a smoother semi-final path.\n\n“I’m gonna stand down as England captain. It’s the right call for me, it’s the right call for the team,” Buttler said during a somber press conference.\n\n“This tournament was going to be an important result-wise for my captaincy and obviously two losses and being out of the tournament, and with a bit of a hangover from some tournaments before, I just probably reached the end of the road for me and my captaincy, which is a shame. I’m sad about that,” the 34-year-old added.\n\nButtler, who took charge in 2022 after Eoin Morg­an’s retirement, guided England to T20 World Cup glory that year but struggled thereafter. His tenure saw 15 defeats in 21 ODIs, including a group-stage exit in the ongoing Cham­pions Trophy after losses to Australia and Afghanistan.\n\n“Brendon [McCullum] has come only recently. I was really excited to work with him… but it has not quite worked out,” Buttler admitted, hinting at unrealised hopes for revival.\n\nButtler’s departure marks the end of an era. His 44 ODIs as captain yielded 18 wins and 25 defeats, with defenses of both World Cup titles ending in disappointment.\n\nSaturday’s game will be Buttler’s last game as Eng­land captain and McCul­lum — who was accompanying Buttler in the press conference — said that his team-mates will hopefully put on a good show.\n\n“I feel incredibly sad for Jos [Buttler],” McCullum said. “We’ve all seen over the last couple years how much he’s invested in captaining his country and trying to get the very best out of those guys around him.”\n\nMcCullum added that Buttler is a very capable leader who has done a significant job with the available players.\n\n“People forget that he won a World Cup only a couple of years ago and that can never be taken away from him,” he said “He’s done a significant job often without the best players available and often around different structures as well.”\n\nThe former New Zea­land captain McCullum insisted that Buttler will remain an important pla­y­er for the side in future.\n\n“It’s incredibly unselfish from Jos to step aside and to leave the post for someone else and he’s still a huge player for us moving forward.”\n\nEngland, playing for pride in Saturday’s dead rubber, confronted a South Africa side eager to secure top spot in Group ‘B’. The Proteas hold three points — earned via a win over Afghanistan and a washout against Australia — but their semi-final qualification hinges on net run rate.\n\n“Cricket can be fickle,” South Africa coach Rob Walter told reporters. “England have a lot of potential. It’s only a matter of time before they find success.”\n\nWhile South Africa’s eli­m­ination remains mathematically possible, it is hig­hly improbable. Aust­ralia’s rain-affected clash with Afghanistan on Friday gua­ranteed the former a semi-final berth with four points.\n\nAfghanistan also have three points but languish far behind the Proteas on net run rate, leaving South Africa’s progression all but assured.\n\nEngland will need to defeat South Africa by at least 207 runs if they bat first or will have to chase in 11.1 overs (considering a target of 300 in both situations) for the Proteas to slip below Afghanistan in the points table.\n\nWalter confirmed the return of wicketkeeper-bat­s­man Heinrich Kla­asen, calling him a “super pla­yer” critical to South Af­r­ica’s title ambitions. Klaa­sen, recovering from an elbow injury, adds firepower to a middle order blending aggression and stability.\n\n“He’s a super player, isn’t he?,” Walter said about Klaasen. “And I think that you probably notice his strength, also based on who the guys around him are that allow him to play that way.\n\n“Obviously he’s got a skill-set at the moment that is right up there with the world’s best, I think we all agree with that.\n\n“And it’s great to have him in your team because you know how destructive he can be.”\n\nDespite logistical challenges — England and others juggle travel across Pakistan, while India remain in Dubai — Walter dismissed concerns.\n\n“If we spend energy worrying about disadvantages, we lose focus on our goals.”\n\nFor England, Saturday’s match offers little but a chance to salvage dignity. For South Africa, it’s a step closer to semi-finals — and a reminder that even giants can stumble.\n\nAs Walter put it: “You can never judge a team unless you’re walking in their shoes.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
