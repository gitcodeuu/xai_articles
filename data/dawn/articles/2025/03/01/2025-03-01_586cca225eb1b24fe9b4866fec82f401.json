I already wish everyone, and first and foremost the athletes, to make the most of this experience to grow, and reach the next level.”\n\nThe FIH Hockey Nations Cup was launched in 2021 with the aim of offering a top-level competition to the best-ranked teams not participating in the FIH Hockey Pro League and giving the winning team the option to be promoted to the FIH Hockey Pro League the next season, precisely.\n\nThe first two editions were played in Potchefstroom, South Africa (2022) and Gniezno, Poland (2024). The inaugural edition was won by South Africa while New Zealand claimed the title in the second edition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
