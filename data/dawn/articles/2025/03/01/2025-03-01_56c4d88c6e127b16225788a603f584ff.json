However, in the recent past, no major attack on law enforcement agencies had been carried out by the Lyari gangs.\n\nThe DIG said that apart from the BLF, they also suspected the involvement of separatist elements of the Sindhudesh Revolutionary Army.\n\nDIG Raza also said that Fitnah Al Khawarij – a term used to describe the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, have recently made videos in Karachi, and some of the suspected militants were also apprehended in the city.\n\nHe recalled that in the past, three major terror acts had also taken place in the jurisdiction of the Preedy police.\n\nIn 2014, one policeman and a private citizen were injured in a terror act, he said.\n\nIn 2015, a police mobile was attacked with a bomb, resulting in the martyrdom of an assistant sub-inspector and constable.\n\nThe third major terror act took place in Daudpota Road in Saddar, in which a bomb-fitted bicycle was used, killing one citizen and injuring nine other persons recently.",
