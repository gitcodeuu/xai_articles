  "content": "GILGIT: The Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Court on Friday suspended the decision of GB government to increase mountaineering royalty and trekking fee in the region.\n\nThe court also suspended increa­­se in Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) environmental manageme­nt fee. The GB Chief Court also sent notices to respondents of the case.\n\nPakistan Association of Tour Operators (Pato) President retired Captain Niaz Ahmed, through his counsel advocate Sanan Ahmed, had submitted a petition in the GB Chief Court challenging the decision of GB government to increase royalty fee of issuance of mountaineering and trekking expeditions and hike in the CKNP fee.\n\nRespondents of the case were GB government, GB chief secretary, GB secretary for tourism, secretary finance, GB council chairman and director of CKNP.\n\nGovt had increased the royalty fee of mountaineering, trekking by 300pcunder GB FinanceAct, 2024\n\nThe petitioners pleaded that the abrupt decision of the GB government to increase the royalty fee of mountaineering and trekking expeditions as well CKNP fee by 300 per cent under the GB Finance Act, 2024, has badly affected adventure tourism in Pakistan.\n\nThe petitioners alleged that the GB government’s decision of massive hike is detrimental to the reg­ion’s growing adventure tourism sector.\n\nPato President retired Captain Niaz Ahmed told Dawn that Pato had approached the GB governm­ent, the federal government and top officials requesting them to withdraw the decision and explained its impacts on adventure tourism in the country, but no-one considered the issue and finally Pato had to approach the court to seek justice.\n\nHe said the GB government’s decision badly impacted the adventure tourism in the country.\n\n“Because of the government’s this decision, not a single expedition team attempted to climb peaks in the country this winter and 70 per cent foreign mountaineers and trekkers cancelled their plans to visit Pakistan for climbing and trekking purpose, the Pato president said.\n\nCaptain Ahmed said that Pakistan earned direct foreign exchange through foreign tourists.\n\n“A foreign adventure tourists spend thousands of dollars during his or her stay in Pakistan, which benefits locals and bring badly-needed foreign exchange to the country, he said.\n\nA large number of GB people, hotel owners, transporters, shops owners and porters depend on adventure tourism for their means of living in the area.\n\nHe said the CKNP fee which charges from mountaineers and trekkers for environmental management has been increased up to 300 dollars, while performance of CKNP to environmental management at GB peaks remained zero.\n\nMuhammad Ali, a tour operator and Pato member, told Dawn that it is very hard to attract foreign adventure tourists to Pakistan despite having potential. He said the foreign adventure tourists even have not travel advisory from their countries to visit Pakistan.\n\nHe said that foreign adventure tourists prefer Nepal for mountaineering and trekking as permits fees for climbing peaks including eight thousanders, except Mount Everest, and trekking fees are less than Pakistan.\n\nThe mountainous region of the country is home to the world’s highest peaks including five eight thousanders and over 100 seven-thousanders. Foreign and national adve­nture-seekers, including climbers and trekkers, visit Gilgit-Baltistan in large numbers every year.\n\nPato members said that the GB government has significantly jacked up the royalty and mountaineering fees, including trekking permits fee, making them the most expensive in the region.\n\nThey explained that one foreign expedition on K-2 fetched about $60,000 to GB, benefiting the government, tour operators, the hospitality sector, transporters, the aviation sector, high-altitude porters and rescue service providers.\n\n“However, the increase in the royalty and permit fees has made it hard for the tour operators to sell mountain expeditions and treks to foreign and domestic clients,” they pointed out. Tour operators expres­sed reservations that they were not considered a stakeholder by the government while it was formulating the policy.\n\nGB Chief Court judge Raja Sha­ke­­el Ahmed conducted the hearing of the case on Friday. After arguments from the Pato counsel, the judge admitted the case for regular hearing and ordered suspension of 300 per cent increase in the royalty fee for mountaineering and trekking and CKNP fees till the next hearing of the case. Notices were also issued to respondents of the case.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
