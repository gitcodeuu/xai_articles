  "content": "ATHENS: Masked youths threw petrol bombs and clashed with police outside the Greek parliament on Friday, as huge crowds gathered in a show of force to mark the second anniversary of the country’s worst rail tragedy.\n\nNearly 200,000 people gathered to demand justice for the 57 victims of the crash that happened between a freight train and a passenger train near the central city of Larissa on Feb 28, 2023. But much of the crowd, including children and the elderly, was forced to flee when hooded and masked attackers hurled petrol bombs and rocks, prompting riot police to fire teargas and stun grenades in response.\n\nPolice then deployed a water cannon as the youths set fire to bins and vandalised bus stops and shop windows. Over 40 arrests were made.\n\nThe ambulance service said nine people were taken to hospital, including a photographer hit in the head by one of the grenades. Several were treated for their injuries in parliament.\n\n“The crowd was extremely packed and many panicked,” protester Sofia Yianniri said. “We tried to get people with children out.” When the peaceful protest resumed, many shouted “murderers” while there were also cries of “justice” and “resign”, apparently directed at Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis.\n\nOpinion polls indicate that most Greeks believe officials covered up vital evidence following the crash, slowing down an investigation that is still incomplete.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
