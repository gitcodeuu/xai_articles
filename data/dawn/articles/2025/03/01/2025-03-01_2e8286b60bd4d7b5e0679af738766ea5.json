Corporate farming would lead to large scale land-grabbing and worsen poverty and unemployment, he said.\n\nHe warned the construction of new canals would exacerbate Sindh’s perennial water crisis, turn the province into a desert, contaminate groundwater resources and accelerate sea intrusion.\n\nHe called upon people to take action before it was too late. “If Sindhis lose the Indus, they will be responsible for their own destruction,” he concluded.\n\nMumtaz Shaikh, Ashraf Palijo, Yasir Jakhro, Ashfaq Channar and other leaders of the party condemned PPP leadership for approving the six canals projects and said the unconstitutional move was designed to exploit Sindh’s water resources.\n\nThe party dismissed the Green Initiative projects as anti-Sindh and a threat to the province’s water security, they said.\n\nThey called for distribution of 50 acres each to landless farmers, including men and women, along with free seeds and fertilisers.\n\nThey denounced illegal seizure of land in Kohistan and demanded that local farmers, especially women, be granted land ownership.\n\nThey condemned forced eviction of indigenous communities from areas around Darawat Dam site and confiscation of their lands.\n\nThe party blamed the PPP government for promoting lawlessness, highlighting the rise of kidnapping, tribal conflicts and criminal activities in Sukkur and Larkana divisions.\n\nThey demanded eradication of corruption, arrest of corrupt ministers and officials and recovery of looted public funds.\n\nStudents protest\n\nStudents of the Quaid-i-Awam University of Engineering, Science and Technology, Nawabshah, held a protest demonstration outside the local press club against federal government’s six canals project, our Nawabshah correspondent adds. A number of students led by Salman Keerio, Waqar Jamali and Hanan Abbasi gathered outside the press club, blocked the road and kept raising slogans against the plan.\n\nThey said that the federal government must shelve the plan and should not create any new canal to be fed through the Indus water.\n\nThey said that people of Sindh would never allow theft of its water.\n\nThey asked the rulers to refrain from taking any such step which seemed to have been taken to “prolonging their rule”.\n\nA police contingent led by DSP City proceeded to the venue of the protest and tried to disperse the protesters but in vain.\n\nHowever, the protesters dispersed peacefully after speeches delivered by their leaders.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
