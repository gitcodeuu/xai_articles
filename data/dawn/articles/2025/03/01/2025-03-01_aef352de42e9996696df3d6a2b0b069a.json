  "content": "MOSCOW: Russia said on Friday it had suggested to the United States resuming direct flights between the two countries during talks in Istanbul this week that addressed “many annoyances” in ties.\n\nThe US and Europe stopped direct flights to Russia three years ago in the first days of Russia’s offensive against Ukraine.\n\n“It was suggested to the American side to examine the possibility of resuming direct air links,” the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.\n\n“Paths to resolving the many annoyances inherited from previous American administrations were discussed,” the statement said.\n\nUS and Europe stopped direct flights after Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago\n\nThursday’s talks in Istanbul were part of a remarkable rapprochement between Washington and Moscow initiated in recent weeks by US President Donald Trump, who also plans to meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin soon.\n\n“The discussions were substantive and professional” and “it was agreed to continue dialogue”, the Russian foreign ministry statement said.\n\nIt said “joint steps were agreed to ensure the unimpeded financing” of the Russian and US embassies and there was discussion on returning to Russia six properties seized by the United States.\n\n“The demand for practical results designed to create conditions for the improvement of bilateral relations in the interests of the peoples of our countries was particularly emphasised,” it said.\n\nThe US and Russian foreign ministers met in Saudi Arabia on February 18 for the first high-level meeting between the two countries since the start of Russia’s campaign in Ukraine.\n\nRussia names new envoy to US\n\nRussia on Friday named career diplomat Alexander Darchiev as new ambassador to the United States, filling a role vacant since last year in another sign of easing tensions.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has sought to restore ruptured ties with Moscow since taking office, reaching out to President Vladimir Putin and initiating high-level talks for the first time since Russia launched its offensive in Ukraine in 2022.\n\nPutin withdrew his former envoy to Washington, Anatoly Antonov, last October but had not named a replacement amid abysmal bilateral relations over the Ukraine conflict.\n\n“The American side handed over an official note of agreement on (Darchiev’s) appointment,” the Russian foreign ministry said.\n\nDarchiev has worked in various Russian diplomatic roles since 1992, most recently as director of the Russian foreign ministry’s North American department. “His departure for his place of service in Washington is expected in the near future,” the ministry added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
