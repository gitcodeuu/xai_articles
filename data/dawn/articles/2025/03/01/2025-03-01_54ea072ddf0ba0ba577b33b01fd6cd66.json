  "content": "LAKKI MARWAT: The police thwarted a planned sit-in by elders outside the main entrance of the Qaboolkhel project site in the Kurrum Par area of Lakki Marwat district on Friday to condemn the government failure to secure the safe release of the abducted Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) workers.\n\nRanra Aman Jirga had announced to close the project by staging a protest demonstration, requesting elders and people from all walks of life to participate in the agitation.\n\nOn Friday, the elders and residents from Lakki city and other parts of the district tried to reach the Qaboolkhel area on the border with Mianwali district of Punjab to hold a protest there. However, they failed to reach the border locality as the police had blocked the Lakki-Darra Tang Road on Mir Qalam and Darra Tang bridges.\n\nThe police move added to the troubles of both transporters and commuters travelling between Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. A government official said the police had barricaded the main artery at Darra Tang Bridge, a border point, and did not allow protesters to move forward. He said security arrangements were made for the protection of the project site.\n\nHowever, residents said the protesters led by elders reached the Chashma Road point at a stone’s throw from Darra Tang Bridge, and held a demonstration there. They condemned the government for not paying any heed to ensuring safe recovery of the hostages.\n\nThey said around two months had lapsed but no practical steps were seen on part of the law enforcement agencies to secure the release of captives, forcing the elders, relatives of the kidnapped workers and local residents to come onto roads.\n\nLater, the protesters ended their agitation after the assistant commissioner held negotiations with elders.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that on Jan 9, a group of militants had kidnapped contract PAEC workers when they were on their way to the project site in Qaboolkhel area in a private coach.\n\nThe kidnappers had set the coach on fire in the forest along the Kurrum River. After the incident, the police and security forces swung into action and secured the release of eight workers from the captivity of abductors the same day.\n\nOn Jan 25, the militants had handed over the body of a kidnapped worker, Rehanullah, to the elders in Zareefwal mountainous terrain.\n\nThe elders had also secured the release of coach driver, Nawaz Khan, who had been kidnapped along with workers.\n\nThe militants had also freed another worker, Irfanullah, on Feb 2 on the request of local elders.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 1st, 2025",
