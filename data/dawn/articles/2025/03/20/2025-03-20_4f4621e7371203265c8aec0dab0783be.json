  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Capital Development Authority (CDA) has decided to provide land to Higher Education Commission (HEC) for construction of two universities in sector I-17.\n\nEarlier, in 2007, CDA had provided 250 acres to HEC in Kuri area, but due to adverse possession issue, the CDA did not hand over possession of the land to HEC.\n\nRecently, the CDA in collaboration with Defense Housing Authority (DHA) has launched Margalla Enclave Housing Project in I-17. While, CDA board decided that all government educational institutions, which were earlier allotted land in Kuri area, will be provided alternative land in I-17.\n\n“The plots designated for universities and educational institutes have been relocated to the Institutional Sector (I-17) following approval from the CDA Board and the federal government. This sector has been specifically earmarked for the development of universities and institutions,” a CDA official told Dawn.\n\nIn a brief statement, the civic agency further stated: “In parallel, for the housing sector at Kurri Model Village, the CDA and the DHA have launched the Margalla Enclave project, also approved by the CDA Board and the federal government.”\n\nOn the other hand, sources in the HEC said that back in 2007, HEC procured 250 acres from CDA for establishment of University of Engineering, Sciences and Technology.\n\nLater on, the HEC out of allotted 250 acre, earmarked 35 acres for National University of Law. Later on despite efforts made by CDA and HEC, the possession of land could not be secured as locals were residing on HEC’s allotted land. Sources said that HEC is now looking for its allotted land or for alternative land. “Soon we will hold meeting with CDA in this regard,” said an official of the HEC.\n\nHowever, CDA officials on Wednesday told Dawn that HEC would be provided land in sector I-17. “We will provide alternative land to HEC in sector I-17, as we did in case of Federal Investigation Agency and some other government organisations,” he said.\n\nSources in HEC said that besides said university land, the HEC had also several plots worth billions of rupees in various marakaz of Islamabad including G-11 and I-8, which are laying unused.\n\n“This is high time for HEC to secure its land and start construction,” said an official of HEC adding that if the CDA fulfill its commitment of providing alternative land in sector I-17, then the commission should take urgent steps to start construction of universities over there to avoid encroachment.\n\nCDA had acquired 3200 acres in Kuri, Mojohan and Rehala revenue estate in Zone IV in 70s. But, it remained badly failed to get possession of its acquired land from local landlords. However, recently, CDA-DHA got possession of 10,000 kanal, where a joint venture of Margala Enclave has been launched. According to agreement, CDA will get 55pc of share in plots while DHA will have 45 pc. The DHA is executing the project and development is continued with full pace.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2025",
