A few kind words can be a source of healing for patients and their attendants,” he said.\n\n“We must ensure the provision of quality healthcare and do everything in our power to improve hospital services,” he said.\n\nDuring the visit, the hospital administration provided a detailed briefing to the minister. He was informed about the medical facilities available, the resources at hand, and the challenges faced by the hospital in delivering quality healthcare. Furthermore, the minister was updated on ongoing projects and the upgradation initiatives at Pims.\n\nIt was informed that Pims receives approximately 6,000 to 7,000 patients daily. The minister was also briefed on the construction of a new 200-bed emergency facility, which is expected to become functional by June.\n\nMustafa Kamal inquired about the various tests being conducted in the hospital’s laboratories. He instructed hospital authorities to submit a comprehensive report on the challenges, recommendations and future plans for improvement at the earliest.\n\nFollowing the briefing, the minister inspected the Outpatient Department (OPD) and emergency wards. He personally reviewed the facilities being provided to patients and interacted with them to understand their concerns.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of compassionate healthcare. “God loves His creation, and humans have been made the best of all creatures. Those who come to hospitals are in distress, and we must work to ease their suffering, not add to it,” he remarked.\n\nHe further stated, “People in pain are close to God. It is our duty to serve them with sincerity and dedication. These positions of authority are a trust from God, and we must fulfil our responsibilities with integrity.”\n\nMinister Mustafa Kamal reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening healthcare infrastructure and ensuring the delivery of efficient medical services to the public.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2025",
