By midday on Wednesday, the figure had risen to 49,547, it said. Israel launched a wave of strikes on Gaza overnight between Monday and Tuesday, by far the deadliest since a fragile truce began in January.\n\nFamilies with young children fled northern Gaza for areas further south, fearing for their lives after Israel urged civilians to leave areas it described as “combat zones”.\n\nGovernments in the Middle East, Europe and beyond called for the renewed hostilities to end.\n\n“The resumption of Israeli strikes yesterday (Tuesday), despite the efforts of mediators, represents a dramatic step backwards,” said French President Emmanuel Macron ahead of talks with Jordan’s King Abdullah II.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Israel’s raids on Gaza “are shattering the tangible hopes of so many Israelis and Palestinians of an end to suffering on all sides”.\n\nEuropean Union foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said she told her Israeli counterpart Gideon Saar that the new strikes on Gaza were “unacceptable”.\n\nBoth Egypt and Qatar, which brokered the Gaza ceasefire alongside the United States, condemned Israel’s resort to military action.\n\nNegotiations have stalled over how to proceed with a ceasefire — whose first phase expired in early March. Israel and the US have sought to change the terms of the deal by extending stage one. That would delay the start of phase two, which was meant to establish a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and was swiftly rejected by Hamas, which demanded full implementation of the original deal.\n\nIsrael and the US have portrayed Hamas’s rejection of an extended stage one as a refusal to release more Israeli prisoners in exchange for Palestinian ones.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2025",
