  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Wednesday established a dedicated anti-corruption hotline, providing a confidential platform to complainants to report incidents of graft, favouritism, or any form of corrupt practices, without fear of retaliation.\n\nThe initiative was made in line with Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi’s determination to foster an environment free of corruption and guided by the principles of accountability and fairness, says an official handout.\n\nThe statement said the whistle blower’s identity will be protected and the choice of remaining anonymous will be fully respected.\n\nThe hotline is accessible through multiple channels, including phone, online portal, email, and text messages, and supports communication in Urdu and English. It operates 24/7, allowing citizens to report incidents at any time, ensuring inclusivity and ease of access.\n\nCourt assures whistleblowers their identity will be protected\n\nAll complaints submitted will be overseen independently by an impartial official reporting directly to the CJP, maintaining transparency and objectivity throughout the process.\n\nEach complaint will be thoroughly tracked and investigated with resolutions provided within a time frame — 30 days for simple cases and up to 60 days for complex cases. Additionally, the complainants will be kept informed about the status of their complaints.\n\nThis initiative reflects CJP’s endeavour in strengthening the public confidence in the institution. Citizens have been urged to utilise this platform to contribute to eliminating bad practices and ensuring transparency and merit. For details, readers are advised to visit SC’s website.\n\nIn a message, CJP Afridi said the justice system, especially the Supreme Court, was his top priority in providing speedy justice. In the last five months, SC decided 11,779 cases as against 7,633 new cases filed.\n\nAfter the arrival of new judges, the decisions on cases would be further expedited, he said, reassuring people that the SC would decide cases early and on merit.\n\nCJP Afridi asked people to inform the court immediately if any official or non-official person asks them for a bribe for fixing a case, obtaining a copy or for any work related to the SC.\n\n“I am following a zero-tolerance policy regarding bribery and recommendation,” he assured, adding that such complaint would be heard immediately, and the complainant’s name would be kept confidential. People are requested to register complaints on the following WhatsApp number 03264442444.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2025",
