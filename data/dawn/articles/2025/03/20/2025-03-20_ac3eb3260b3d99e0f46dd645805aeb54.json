  "content": "GWADAR was supposed to be the next big thing in Pakistan, the jewel in the CPEC crown, a shimmering entrepôt on the Balochistan coast that would transform both the country and the province. But a decade after that landmark project with China was launched, the people of Gwadar still struggle for basic facilities such as regular water supply and uninterrupted power. In fact, the lack of such facilities has engendered resentment in the port city and the wider Makran region, feeding into the greater sense of alienation that affects Balochistan. Gwadar and other towns in Makran have witnessed large demonstrations calling for basic civic facilities, amongst other demands. Perhaps sensing the situation — albeit a bit late in the day — the prime minister has formed a committee to look into Gwadar’s water and power woes. The body, consisting of officials from several departments, is due to meet today, and the PM has reportedly ordered the water issue to be resolved within days.\n\nThe water problem in Gwadar is not new, as the port town is located in an arid zone, with scant rainfall. It is also true that official projects to resolve the issue have been plagued by financial irregularities — a nationwide malaise. It is hoped that these are not more empty promises, and that the civic issues of Gwadar and the rest of the Makran coast are resolved on a long-term basis. The state’s plans of transforming Gwadar into a regional shipping and logistics hub sound farcical if its people do not have water and power. This is, in fact, reflective of the overall official approach towards Balochistan: tall promises, but little on the ground. It is this neglect that has fuelled resentment in the province. Balochistan’s people need basic facilities and must be partners in their province’s development to ensure national progress. The state cannot afford to neglect Balochistan any longer.\n\nPublished in Dawn, August 15th, 2025",
