Subsequently, one vehicle loaded with coal from Afghanistan entered Pakistan, while another loaded with cement crossed over into Afghanistan.\n\nThe border reopening ceremony was preceded by a Wednesday morning meeting between border security officials at Torkham, during which they agreed to abstain from new constructions till the issue is permanently resolved.\n\nIt was agreed on Wed­nesday morning that initially the border would be reopened for vehicular tra­ffic and most serious pat­i­ents, while regular ped­e­strian movement wou­ld be restored in a couple of days.\n\nIt was also learnt thro­ugh reliable sources that backdoor diplomatic channels between Peshawar and Jalalabad (capital of Nangarhar) were instrumental in the ope­ning of the border, besides two rounds of talks bet­ween the jirga members. The first session was held at Torkham on March 7.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the aut­horities sent instructions to the customs, immigration and National Log­istic Cell officials to operationalise their systems in anticipation of the border reopening.\n\nThe Torkham border cro­s­sing, considered one of the main and busiest trade rou­tes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, was abruptly closed on the night of Feb 20 over differences betw­een the border security for­c­es regarding the construction of a security check post by Afghans near the zero point.\n\nThe tensions boiled over, and both sides engaged in a gun battle for three days, starting March 3. A 57-me­mber jirga was then constituted by Pakistan on March 7 when senior members of the Afghan Chamber of Commerce and Industries expressed their desire to settle the issue through negotiations.\n\nThe number of jirga me­m­­bers was later reduced to 36.\n\nIt was during the second session of the jirga held on March 17 at the Afghan Gumruk (customs offices) that both countries agreed to end their differences with the immediate reopening of the border and resolving the border issue.\n\nLocal traders believed that the border closure dep­r­ived Pakistan of a cumulative profit of $40.5 million in revenue earnings, while another Rs545m was lost daily due to the ban on imports from Afghanistan during the said period.\n\nThey argued that the bila­teral trade volume with Afghanistan via Tork­ham jumped from 350 loa­d­ed export and import vehicles to almost 800 vehicles per day prior to the closure of the border on Feb 21.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2025",
