Now we have been trying to get the support of the political forces which are not part of the parliament. We have also contacted Jamaat-i-Islami leadership and I am quite hopeful that the situation will improve,” he said.\n\nWhile admitting that there are some differences within parties, Mr Akbar said that such small obstacles will not affect the alliance.\n\n“We will march towards Islamabad after Eidul Fitr, but it is also possible that we may hold a protest outside the Adiala jail on three Eidul Fitr days, he said.\n\nThe PTI has been trying hard to get concessions for the founding chairman and it did all possible efforts to get Imran Khan released on payroll to attend a meeting of the Parliamentary Committee on National Security which was briefed by armed forces after the Jaffar Express incident.\n\nAfter failing to get him [Imran Khan] released, the PTI tried to get approval for the party leaders to meet Mr Khan in the jail, but even that request was not allowed by the government due to which the party has now decided to boycott the meeting of the committee. Now the PTI has been aiming to start a massive movement after Eid to put pressure on the government to get some concessions for the incarcerated ex-PM.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 26th, 2025",
