  "content": "A destructive Tim Seifert ensured New Zealand made short work of their 129-run target to win the final Twenty20 against Pakistan by eight wickets on Wednesday and take the series 4-1.\n\nSeifert, who made an unbeaten 97 off 38 deliveries, set the big-hitting tone in Wellington with 18 off the first over by Jahandad Khan after being hit on the body with the first ball.\n\nFellow opener Finn Allen followed with 14 in the second over from Mohammad Ali.\n\nWhen Jahandad returned in the sixth over, Seifert was even more belligerent when he belted 25, including three sixes.\n\n“After I nearly got hit on the head with that first ball I thought there’s only one way to play,” Seifert said.\n\n“A few shots go your way and you’re backing yourself and backing your skills and when you do get a match up you commit 100 per cent and try to take that bowler down.”\n\nHe hit 10 sixes in his innings and wrapped up the match with three back-to-back sixes off the bowling of Shadab Khan.\n\nThe Kiwis lost just two wickets as they chased down the target in 10 overs. Both wickets were taken by left-arm spinner Sufiyan Muqeem, who finished the match with figures of 2-6 off his 2 overs.\n\nAllen compiled a bright 27 from 12 deliveries, including five fours and a six, before he was first to fall in the seventh over when New Zealand had reached 93.\n\nMark Chapman had a short stay and was gone for three before Seifert and Daryl Mitchell (two not out) brought the hosts home as they finished 131-2.\n\nPakistan captain Salman Agha said the one positive for him in a lop-sided series was the experience gained by his young squad.\n\n“Obviously they (New Zealand) were outstanding and you have to credit to them. They just outplayed us in the whole series,” he said.\n\n“But we have a few positives and we’ll take that and move forward. We will back them. They will have more games and they will have experience and they will come good.”\n\nPakistan, batting first, struggled before reaching 128-9 on the back of a mid-order rally by Salman and Shadab.\n\nThe pair came together at 52-5 and put on 54 for the sixth wicket, refusing to be pressured by the New Zealand pace attack which dominated the first half of the innings.\n\nShadab put on 28 off 20 deliveries, including five boundaries, while Salman scored 51 off 39.\n\nBoth fell to Jimmy Neesham, the pick of the New Zealand bowlers with impressive figures of 5-22, his maiden five-wicket bag in T20Is, from his four overs.\n\nJacob Duffy, who took 2-18, started the Pakistan batting rout when he claimed the first wicket in the second over with the removal of Hasan Nawaz for his third duck in the series.\n\nHe added Omair Yousuf in his following over as Pakistan struggled to cope with Duffy’s swing and seam movement, as well as the bounce generated by Will O’Rourke and Ben Sears.\n\nNew Zealand, who won the toss, made one change for the match with Sears coming in for Zak Foulkes.\n\nPakistan made five changes with Omair, Usman Khan, Jahandad, Sufyan Moqim and Mohammad Ali all coming in.\n\nThe teams now move on to a one-day international series starting in Napier on Saturday.",
