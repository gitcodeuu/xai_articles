  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) on Tuesday voiced displeasure over the non-submission of a report on sugar crisis and called the secretaries of industries, commerce and food security ministries for a briefing on it\n\nPAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan reminded officials that a report had been requested but was yet to be presented.\n\nConsequently, the committee summoned the secretaries of three ministries to provide details about sugar prices, imports and exports.\n\nThe committee also scrutinised funds allocated to the ministry of housing and works that lapsed at the end of the fiscal year due to delays in their release. The secretary of housing and works attributed delays to the late release of final grants.\n\nCommittee miffed at irregularities in PWD, delays in release of funds to housing ministry\n\nExpressing frustration over delayed disbursement of funds by the finance ministry, PAC member Naveed Qamar said this was a “mockery” that funds were released on June 26, four days before the end of the fiscal year. The committee questioned finance ministry officials on whether the lapse was anticipated and summoned the secretaries of finance and planning ministries to address procedural flaws.\n\nThe meeting also reviewed audit objections related to the ministry of housing and works. The auditor general’s report highlighted financial mismanagement exceeding Rs33.65 billion in the ministry and its subordinate bodies.\n\nDuring the meeting, the PAC chairman described the Public Works Department (PWD) as “one of the most corrupt institutions” in the country after audit reports indicated widespread irregularities.\n\nOpposition leader Omar Ayub Khan, a PAC member, recommended a performance audit of PWD.\n\nThe auditor general confirmed that while specific projects had been audited, a comprehensive audit of the institution had not yet been conducted.\n\nPWD set to be dissolved\n\nHousing and Works Secretary Shehzad Khan Bangash informed the committee that PWD was set to be dissolved, with its projects transferred to provincial governments, relevant departments, and the Capital Development Authority.\n\nHowever, concerns were raised over cost escalations and project delays due to this transition.\n\nThe committee also reviewed an audit objection regarding contract awards worth over Rs12 billion in violation of regulations by PWD.\n\nThe PAC gave two months to officials to complete all inquiries into alleged financial irregularities at PWD and demanded that all responsible individuals be held accountable.\n\nCommittee members were also alarmed by payment of Rs11bn to contractors without some mandatory reports. The authorities were directed to submit a response within two months and take action against responsible officials.\n\nThe PAC chairman emphasised that all those accountable must be identified within a month.\n\nThe committee also reviewed an audit objection regarding Rs184m spent on luxury maintenance work for two residences.\n\nAsked who resided in these properties, ministry officials failed to provide an answer, prompting a protest by committee member Khawaja Shiraz Mahmood to protest.\n\nWhile expressing concern regarding the affairs of NAB, PAC members sought details of the annual expenditure of NAB and the amount recovered through its investigations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 26th, 2025",
