However, more than 60 cases of street crime were reported to the police.\n\nIn one of the biggest robberies, employees of a private company were robbed of Rs9 million by two motorcycle riders at Rawal Road, while a family was deprived of cash and jewellery worth Rs5 million by burglars who broke into their house in Naseerabad.\n\nAnother family also reported to the police that burglars broke into their house and took away Rs2500,000 and gold jewellery worth Rs1,750,000 in Westridge.\n\nA police spokesman said crime meetings were held at the SDP Civil Lines and SDPO Saddar offices which were chaired by the SSP Investigation and attended by SP Potohar, SP Saddar, SDPOs, SHOs, in-charges of checkpoints and other officials.\n\nThe SSP Investigation reviewed the performance of the officers and issued necessary instructions. The SSP Investigation said that cases under investigation should be sorted out in the light of the facts as soon as possible and those involved in serious crimes should be brought to justice.\n\nHe said that the crackdown against drug dealers should be further accelerated and actions against criminals should be expedited.\n\nThough the SSP Investigation claimed that protection of the lives and property of the public was the top priority of the police, the crime wave continued to shake the nerves of people as more than 60 incidents of street crime were reported to the police on Monday.\n\nAmanullah, a resident of Dhoke Gangal, lodged an FIR with the Sadiqabad police stating that he along with his colleague Mohammad Arslan went to Saddar to withdraw cash from banks. He said after withdrawing Rs9 million and Rs3 million from separate banks, they were returning to their company office in their car when two motorcycle riders intercepted them on Rawal Road.\n\nHe said the robbers held them at gunpoint and snatched the cash and escaped.\n\nAli Ahmad lodged a complaint with the Westridge police saying that he had gone to Swat with his family after locking his house at Range Road. On their return, they found Rs2,50,000 and gold jewellery worth Rs1.7 million stolen.\n\nA similar complaint was registered with the Naseerabad police by Adeel Arshad who lost Rs200,000 and 18 tola gold jewellery as burglars entered his house located in Mumtaz City. The total value of the stolen goods was estimated at Rs5 million.\n\nMeanwhile, a police spokesman said 6718 accused involved in different cases had been arrested along with 220 members of 102 gangs involved in street crime during the year. He said 11 vehicles, 185 motorcycles and valuables including ornaments, had also been recovered.\n\nThe spokesman said that 597 drug peddlers were also arrested and 401kg charas, 4.65kg ice, 5kg heroin and 7082 litres liquor were recovered during the period.\n\nMoreover, 437 people were arrested for keeping illegal weapons while 19 Kalashnikov, 347 pistols, 24 rifles and ammunition were recovered.
