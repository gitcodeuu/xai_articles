While Nizar Ali picked up two wickets.\n\nIn turn, Peshawar raced to 54 runs in 6.3 overs losing Maaz Sad­aqat and Sahibzada Farhan (26 off 13, five fours) and Adil Amin in the process. Israrullah (30 off 27, five fours) and Iftikhar Ahm­ed (20 off 33) stitched a valuable 42-run stand, when Faisala­bad eked out the scalps of Nizar Ali in 15th over and Iftikhar in 18th.\n\nApart from Amir’s brilliance with the bat, Peshawar were also aided by Mohammad Amir Bar­ki’s nine-ball 12 which included one six. The eighth-wicket duo of Amir and Mohammad Zulkifal added unbeaten 20 runs in eight balls to steer Peshawar to victory.\n\nIn the fourth quarter-final, Lahore Blues clinched a semi-final spot with a 33-run win over Sialkot here.\n\nBatting first, Lahore posted 184, powered by Umar Siddiq’s 44-ball 65 and Nisar Ahmad’s quick-fire 21 off seven. Hasan Ali starred for Sialkot, taking 4-42, including three wickets and a run-out in the final four balls of the innings.\n\nIn reply, Sialkot fell short at 151 in 18.5 overs despite Mirza Tahir Baig’s blistering 77 off 47 including five fours and five sixes. Lah­ore Blues, led by Huss­ain Talat and Nisar Ahmad’s two wic­k­ets apiece sealed the win. Moha­m­mad Rizwan and Mohammad Irf­an pic­k­ed up two wickets each.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 26th, 2025",
