The fires are collectively the third largest in South Korea’s history, with acting Interior and Safety Minister Ko Ki-dong saying 14,694 hectares had been affected early Tuesday.\n\n“Strong winds, dry weather, and haze are hampering firefighting efforts,” Ko told a disaster and safety meeting.\n\nThe government has declared a state of emergency in four regions. “The wind was so strong that I couldn’t stand still,” said evacuated Andong resident Kwon So-han. “The fire came from the mountain and fell on my house. Nothing could be done,” the 79-year-old said.\n\nAuthorities in Andong issued an emergency alert late Tuesday to residents of the historic Hahoe Folk Village — a Unesco-listed world heritage site popular with tourists — as the blaze drew closer.\n\n“The Uiseong Angye wildfire is moving in the direction” of that area, the alert said. “Residents are requested to evacuate immediately.” In Uiseong, agency reporters saw the sky full of smoke and haze, with the Korea Forest Service saying that the containment rate for the fire in that area had decreased from 60 to 55 per cent on Tuesday.
