  "content": "LAHORE: Deputy Inspector General (DIG) administration Imran Kishwar resumed his office on Tuesday, some 12 days after his resignation was ‘regretted’ by the inspector general of police.\n\nHe had resigned from the Police Service of Pakistan (PSP) when he was not considered for promotion from BPS-19 to BPS-20 by the Central Selection Board (CSB).\n\nMr Kishwar was also heading the joint investigation team (JIT) investigating the May 9 cases lodged against Imran Khan, his senior party leaders and workers.\n\nSources said he had tendered his resignation following the internal rifts with some senior Punjab police officers and he blamed them for using influence to spoil his promotion case. They said Punjab Police chief Dr Usman Anwar refused to forward his resignation to the establishment division. He had visited the residence of Mr Kishwar along with the Lahore CCPO and assured him of ‘justice’.\n\nThe sources said Imran Kishwar finally resumed his office when the IGP ‘regretted’ his resignation and informed him about it officially on Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 26th, 2025",
