Leader of the Opposition Ali Khurshidi and Sikandar Ali Shoro were also present.\n\nThe house committee, which was formed by the provincial assembly on Jan 13, had assigned investigations into the controversial results to a fact-finding committee, headed by NED University’s Vice Chancellor Dr Sarosh Lodi.\n\nDuring the meeting, Dr Lodi presented the 250-page report that highlighted irregularities and mismanagement in various stages of the examination process, including assessment, record-keeping, and mark sheets.\n\nOn the recommendations of the fact-finding committee, the meeting granted 15 per cent additional marks to students in Physics and Maths each and 20pc additional marks in Chemistry.\n\nBIEK treated students unfairly, says minister\n\nThe education minister said that students were treated unfairly by the board.\n\nHe added that the BIEK had been engaging in malpractice regarding results for the past eight years, which must now be stopped.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the media corner of the Sindh Assembly after the meeting, he said that the fact-finding committee uncovered serious irregularities within the board.\n\n“The inquiry committee has been given the authority to identify those responsible, and we will recommend action against such elements as per the rules,” he said.\n\nHe also stressed the need for reforms in the board system. “We will continue this process. A centralised system is also needed to oversee board operations,” he added.\n\nExpressing concern over the state of affairs, he remarked that the BIEK was “operating like a mafia, manipulating the results of students who had previously scored well in their matriculation exams”.\n\nHe pointed out that BIEK results were “significantly worse compared to other education boards in the province, creating a negative impression”.\n\n“We will present all recommendations from the committee to the Sindh chief minister,” he concluded.\n\nDamning indictment of BIEK\n\nThe report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, has highlighted severe irregularities and discrepancies in the BIEK examination process, its IT infrastructure and data security.\n\nThe committee found that, in many cases, examiners failed to accurately total students’ marks. It also found what it called “un-assessed portions in copies”.\n\nFor the scrutiny cases considered for relief, the report largely blamed “negligence on part of data entry staff for entry of marks”.\n\nThe report stated that there was a high risk to data integrity and security with several gaps in digital maintenance of records.\n\nIt also pointed out the incompetence of the board staff in terms of the management of digital systems and stated that most work was still being done manually, which also led to miscounting and issues in data entry of multiple students’ exams.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 26th, 2025",
