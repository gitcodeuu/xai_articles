They demanded immediate shelving of the plan.\n\nThousands of people from all walks of life took part in widespread rallies held in all major and smaller towns of Sindh, right from Larkana to Thatta.\n\nThey flooded streets of their respective areas, waving banners and raising slogans against the ‘anti-Sindh’ project.\n\nPPP leaders, allies of the federal government, also accused Islamabad of attempting to turn Sindh barren by diverting its water resources to other regions.\n\nDemands immediate shelving of controversial scheme\n\nIn Karachi, a huge rally was organised outside the Karachi Press Club where senior party leaders, including Mian Raza Rabbani, Waqar Mehdi and Sadia Javed, addressed the participants.

When we have the forum of Council of Common Interests (CCI) available to us to decide about provinces objections regarding water distribution, then why the federal government is avoiding convening its meeting?”\n\nIn Larkana, the party’s district body took out a big rally from Zulfikar Bagh to Jinnah Bagh to join the Sindh-wide protest.\n\nMNAs Khursheed Junejo and Nazir Bughio; MPA Jamil Soomro, who is also the political secretary to PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, Larkana Mayor Khair Muhammed Shaikh, Special Assistant to Chief Minister Tariq Anwar Siyal, former MNA Apa Naseeban Channa, Dr Sakina Gaad and others participated in the rally. Carrying banners and placards inscribed with the slogans of ‘No more canals on River Indus’, the protesters marched up to Jinnah Bagh, where the leaders delivered their speeches.\n\nThe participants also included the party’s taluka and town chapters’ office-bearers and members.\n\nMNA Khursheed Junejo, MPA Jamil Soomro district council chairman Aijaz Leghari, in their speeches, rejected the canals project, and said that water issue did not pertain to any political party or nationalist outfit, but it was linked with the entire province.\n\nThey said that the Indus is our jugular vein and every soul residing in Sindh would be affected with the construction of these canals.\n\nThey called for a collectively struggle to address the issue.
