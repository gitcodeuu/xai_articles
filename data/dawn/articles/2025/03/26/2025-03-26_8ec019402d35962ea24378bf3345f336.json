Thus, the IGP recommended detaining the said activists under the MPO-1960 for 30 days, it added.\n\nThe official order further stated: “On the basis of the request and considering the merits of the case, the government of Sindh was satisfied that there was a serious apprehension of public safety and in the interest of the country and public, the presence of above persons, at any public place was likely to pose grave threat to the public safety and can cause breach of peace and tranquility.\n\n“Therefore, under section 3 (i) of the Sindh Maintenance of Public Order Ordinance, 1960, the government of Sindh has sufficient reasons to believe that the said persons be arrested and detained for a period of 30 days from the date of arrest. Their custody shall be placed under the senior superintendent Central Prison Karachi. They shall be at liberty to make representation to the provincial government against this order.”\n\nArrests in Balochistan\n\nMeanwhile, police in Quetta arrested 10 more activists of the BYC and registered three cases against them. These cases were filed on Tuesday after the BYC workers blocked roads at Sona Khan Chowk, Qambrani Road and Western Bypass in Quetta. The cases were registered at the Sariab, New Sariab and Brewery police stations.\n\nIn addition to the arrested activists, BYC leaders, including Sabiha Baloch, Gulzadi Baloch, Shal Ali Baloch, Nosheen Baloch, Sabghatullah Baloch, Gulzar Dost Baloch and Riaz Gishkori, have also been named in the cases.\n\nThe cases, filed on complaints by police officers, include charges of property damage, illegal assembly, sedition, incitement to violence and spreading hatred.\n\nThe Quetta police have so far registered seven cases against more than 500 BYC leaders and activists, including Mahrang Baloch, at four different police stations. The Balochistan High Court on Tuesday admitted for hearing a petition filed against the arrest of BYC chief organiser Mahrang Baloch, and also allowed her to meet her relatives and lawyers in jail.\n\nA BHC division bench, comprising Justice Rozi Khan Bareech and Justice Shoukat Ali Rakhshani, heard the petition filed by Nadia Baloch, the sister of Dr Mahrang.\n\nThe petitioner, through her lawyers Habib Tahir, Imran Baloch, Khalid Kubdani and Mudalfa Achakzai, argued that Mahrang Baloch was arrested under Section 3 of the MPO without any justification, violating Articles 15, 16, and 19 of the Constitution.\n\nAfter hearing arguments from both sides, the bench accepted the petition for a regular hearing and issued notices to the federal interior ministry, the provincial home department and the Balochistan police chief.\n\nThe petitioner further requested the court to grant permission for family members and lawyers to meet Mahrang Baloch in district jail, as jail authorities had previously denied them access when they attempted to visit her.\n\nThe bench granted permission with an observation that every prisoner has the right to meet their lawyers and relatives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 26th, 2025",
