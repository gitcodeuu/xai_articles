  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Musadik Masood Malik on Tuesday commended the Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) for its successful rescue and rehabilitation of a seven-year-old Asian black bear who was subjected to severe cruelty.\n\nThe Ministry of Climate Change said that the tragic ordeal of the bear named Rocky came to light after a viral video exposed his harrowing condition. Forced into 35 brutal dog fights in Sargodha, he was left with a shattered jaw, unable to eat and suffering from severe injuries. The IWMB, in collaboration with Four Paws International, led a swift rescue mission, ensuring Rocky’s safe rehabilitation.\n\nFollowing a request from the Punjab Wildlife Department, IWMB and Four Paws International intervened, sedating and transporting Rocky to the IWMB Rescue and Rehabilitation Centre in Islamabad.\n\nThere, he received urgent medical treatment, including wound stitching, neutering and microchipping for identification. In a significant milestone, Rocky was successfully relocated to a spacious new enclosure on Tuesday.\n\nFederal Minister Musadik Masood Malik, who attended the handover ceremony, praised the IWMB’s efforts and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to wildlife protection.\n\n“Rocky’s rescue highlights our resolve to protect Pakistan’s wildlife,” said Minister Malik adding that, “we commend the relentless work of IWMB and assure the nation that firm steps are being taken to prevent such cruelty, strengthen wildlife laws and safeguard endangered species like the Asian Black Bear.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 26th, 2025",
