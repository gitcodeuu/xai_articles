Later, they opened the road after their representatives held talks with police officials.\n\nThe shopkeepers alleged that the additional AC repeatedly visited their outlets and imposed fines on small vendors.\n\nMeanwhile, Bannu division commissioner Mohammad Ali Shah has also asked the deputy commissioners to ensure availability of sugar, price regulations and cleanliness during the fasting month.\n\n“The administrative prudence and respect of vendors should be the guiding principles during the campaign without any compromise on profiteering and hoarding,” he maintained, making clear that all relevant officers should be on ground without any fail and price monitoring report should be shared on a daily basis.\n\nIn Bajaur, the district administration arrested eight butchers and owners of two confectionery shops for violating the official price list.\n\nThe arrests were made during raids in different bazaars in Khar and Sadiqabad areas, said a statement issued from the deputy commissioner’s office.\n\nIt said the action against the butchers was taken on public complaints.\n\nThe arrested butchers were later sent to the assistant commissioner’s office for further legal action. The statement said the confectionery shops were also sealed.\n\nIn Shangla, the district administration initiated a crackdown on shopkeepers and butchers for fleecing consumers and selling substandard, unhygienic food items.\n\nDeputy commissioner Mohammad Fawad Khan on Monday told Dawn that he had directed all the assistant commissioners to keep the prices of essential items under check.\n\nHe said 18 traders, including butchers, and restaurant managers, were booked and FIRs lodged against them in Alpuri, Bisham, Puran, Chakesar, Martung.\n\nHe said over three dozen shops were sealed.\n\nDC Shangla said complaint desks had been established in major bazaars where people could lodge their complaints against the shopkeepers for hoarding and profiteering.\n\nAlpuri assistant commissioner Mohammad Hamid Saddiqui said price lists were updated daily and provided to the shopkeepers.\n\nIn Abbottabad, the district administration arrested nine butchers for selling meat at high prices.\n\nOn the instructions of deputy commissioner Captain retired Sanaullah Khan, special price control teams have been formed, which are inspecting markets on a daily basis to ensure implementation of price list and take prompt action on public complaints.\n\nLegal action was also taken against several shopkeepers for selling chicken and other essential items at exorbitant prices. Moreover, under supervision of additional assistant commissioner (revenue) Arshad Mahmood, prices of vegetables, fruits and poultry products were fixed in consultation with price control magistrate, union staff, representatives of the food department and business community.\n\nIn Mansehra, the price of locally grown (indigenous) chicken surged to a record high of Rs1,000 per kilogramme on Monday while the rates of fruits and other essential commodities also skyrocketed with the advent of Ramazan.\n\n“Though desi chicken is not commonly consumed here, its price has jumped to Rs1,000 per kg. Poultry products have also experienced a price hike with the beginning of the holy month,” said Mohammad Azam, a chicken seller on Abbottabad Road.\n\nMeanwhile, broiler chicken is being sold at Rs460 per kg, and the Egyptian hen (commonly known as Misri Murghi here) is being sold at Rs800 per kg. The price of eggs has also increased suddenly in local markets.\n\n“Before Ramazan, eggs were sold at Rs220 per dozen, but they are now priced at Rs288 per dozen,” a resident, Sadaqat Ali said.\n\nHe said although the district administration has set different rates for eggs based on weight, traders continued to sell them at uniform prices without considering weight variations.\n\n“The administration has fixed the price of eggs weighing 40 to 50 grams at Rs268 per dozen, but traders are still selling them at higher rates,” he said.\n\nThough the district administration has not fixed the price of garlic in its price list, it is still currently being sold at Rs800 per kg. “While the administration regularly issues price lists for fruits and vegetables shopkeepers and traders continue to overcharge buyers,” Mr Ali added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
