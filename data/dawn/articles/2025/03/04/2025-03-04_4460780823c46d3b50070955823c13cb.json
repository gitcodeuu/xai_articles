Nobody wants peace more than Ukrainians. My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump’s strong leadership to get a peace that lasts,” Zelensky said in a post on X.\n\nHe said Ukraine was ready to agree to a “truce in the sky — ban on missiles, long-ranged drones, bombs on energy and other civilian infrastructure — and truce in the sea immediately, if Russia will do the same”.\n\nZelensky clashed with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance over Washington’s stance on the war in a stunning exchange in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nThe spat capped weeks of escalating tensions between the two leaders, after Trump called his Ukrainian counterpart a “dictator” and Zelensky said the Republican had succumbed to Russian “disinformation”.\n\n“Our meeting in Washington, at the White House on Friday, did not go the way it was supposed to be. It is regrettable that it happened this way. It is time to make things right. We would like future cooperation and communication to be constructive,” Zelensky said in his post on X.\n\nHe also said that Kyiv was ready to sign a deal giving the US preferential access to Ukraine’s natural resources and minerals at “any time and in any convenient format”.\n\nThe deal was supposed to be inked in Washington last week before Zelensky was kicked out of the White House after the public row with Trump.\n\nEarlier today, Trump suspended military aid to Ukraine, a White House official said, sharply escalating pressure on Kyiv to agree to peace negotiations with Russia.\n\nTrump had declined to rule out a pause when quizzed by reporters, but any disruption in the flow of US arms to the frontline would rapidly weaken Ukraine’s chance of beating back the Russian invasion.\n\n“The president has been clear that he is focused on peace. We need our partners to be committed to that goal as well,” a White House official told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\n“We are pausing and reviewing our aid to ensure that it is contributing to a solution,” the official added.\n\nTrump also warned he would “not put up” much longer with Zelensky’s defiant stance, and said the Ukrainian leader should be “more appreciative” of US support.\n\nSpeaking at the White House, Trump said Zelensky “won’t be around very long” without a ceasefire deal with Moscow.\n\nThe pause has gone into effect immediately and affects hundreds of millions of dollars of weaponry in the process of being sent to Ukraine, the New York Times reported.\n\nZelensky, for his part, said today he was seeking for the war to end “as soon as possible”.\n\nThe comment came after the Ukrainian president accused Russia — which invaded Ukraine in 2014 and greatly expanded the conflict in 2022 — of not being serious about peace.\n\nZelensky insisted that tough security guarantees were the only way to end the conflict.\n\nBut Trump’s stance has upended US support for Ukraine, and Washington’s allies more broadly, and stoked concern about the United States pivoting to Russia.\n\nAfter weekend crisis talks in London, Britain and France are investigating how to propose a one-month truce “in the air, at sea and on energy infrastructure” — potentially backstopped by troops on the ground.\n\nZelensky had said discussions were still focusing on the “first steps,” adding: “An agreement on ending the war is very, very far away” — a comment that angered Trump.\n\nZelensky added in a video statement today that “real, honest peace” would only come with security guarantees for Ukraine, which agreed to denuclearise in 1994 only in exchange for protection provided by the United States and Britain.\n\n“It was the lack of security guarantees for Ukraine 11 years ago that allowed Russia to start with the occupation of Crimea and the war in Donbas, then the lack of security guarantees allowed Russia to launch a full-scale invasion,” Zelensky said.\n\nRussia dismissed his comments, accusing him of not wanting peace — echoing US criticisms after he was shouted down in the Oval Office on Friday.\n\nOn the ground, Ukrainian officials reported fatalities from a Russian missile strike on a military training facility, some 130 kilometers from the front line.\n\nA respected military blogger said between 30 and 40 soldiers were killed and 90 more wounded in the attack near Dnipro on Saturday.\n\nTrump has previously called Zelensky, president since 2019, a “dictator” for not holding elections, even though martial law precludes any vote because of the war.\n\nZelensky dismissed calls for him to resign, repeating his pledge to do so only if Ukraine were given Nato membership, which Russia — and now the United States under Trump — opposes.\n\nIn Moscow, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov blamed Zelensky for Friday’s White House blow-up with Trump and Vice President JD Vance, saying he “demonstrated a complete lack of diplomatic abilities”.\n\n“He doesn’t want peace,” Peskov told reporters.\n\nBut Germany’s likely next chancellor, Friedrich Merz, said the astonishing clash was a “deliberate escalation” by Trump.\n\nUS and Russian officials have held talks on ending the war, enraging Ukraine and Europe for being sidelined, and prompting fears in Kyiv and beyond that any deal could threaten the country’s future.\n\nZelensky triggered Trump and Vance’s ire by questioning whether Russia could be trusted to uphold a truce.",
