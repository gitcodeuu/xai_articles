Both the Canadian dollar and Mexican peso fell against the greenback.\n\nTrump has maintained a blistering pace of tariff actions since taking office in January, including fully restored 25pc tariffs on steel and aluminum imports that take effect March 12, rescinding prior exemptions.\n\nTrump’s “America First” agenda, aimed at redrawing trade relationships in favor of the US, is expected to be a centerpiece of his Tuesday night address to a joint session of Congress.\n\nTrump on Saturday opened a national security investigation into imports of lumber and wood products that could result in steep tariffs. Canada, already facing 14.5pc US tariffs on softwood lumber, would be hit particularly hard.\n\nA week earlier, Trump revived a probe into countries that levy digital services taxes, proposed fees of up to $1.5 million on every Chinese-built ship entering a US port and launched a tariff investigation into copper imports.\n\nThese add to his plans for higher “reciprocal tariffs” to match the levies of other countries and offset their other trade barriers, a move that could hit the European Union hard.\n\nChina said it would slap fresh tariffs on a range of agricultural imports from the United States as of next week, in retaliation against a hike in levies by Washington.\n\n“Additional 15pc tariffs will be imposed on chicken, wheat, corn and cotton,” Beijing’s finance ministry said in a statement.\n\nAnd “additional 10pc tariffs will be imposed on sorghum, soybeans, pork, beef, aquatic products, fruits, vegetables and dairy products”, it added.\n\nBeijing in announcing its levies condemned the “unilateral imposition of tariffs by the US”.\n\nThe move “exacerbates the burden on US companies and consumers, and undermines the foundation of economic and trade cooperation between China and the United States”, the finance ministry said.\n\nBeijing’s commerce ministry also said it would file a lawsuit at the World Trade Organisation over the additional 10pc tariffs.\n\nTrump also said he told the leaders of Japan and China they could not continue to reduce the value of their currencies, as doing so would be unfair to the US.\n\nHighlighting the risk that Japan’s export-reliant economy faces from uncertainty over Washington’s currency and tariff policies, the Nikkei benchmark tumbled nearly 2pc on Tuesday as Trump’s comments drove up the yen.\n\nThe yen briefly climbed to 148.60 per dollar on Tuesday, up from around 150 on Monday.\n\n“I’ve called President Xi, I’ve called the leaders of Japan to say you can’t continue to reduce and break down your currency,” Trump said at the White House on Monday.\n\n“You can’t do it because it’s unfair to us. It’s very hard for us to make tractors, Caterpillar here, when Japan, China and other places are killing their currency, meaning driving it down,” he said.\n\nInstead of complaining repeatedly over the phone over such attempts, the United States could make up for the disadvantage its manufacturers suffer by imposing tariffs, Trump added.\n\n“So all of these things add up,” he said. “And the way you solve it very easily is with tariffs.”\n\nTokyo was not adopting policies directly aimed at weakening the yen, Japanese Finance Minister Katsunobu Kato said, when asked about Trump’s comments.\n\n“Japan has confirmed its basic stance on currency policy” with G7 countries and the United States, including at two-way talks with US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Jan 29, Kato told a news conference in Tokyo on Tuesday.\n\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba also told parliament Japan was not pursuing a so-called “currency devaluation policy”, adding that he had no phone calls from Trump on exchange-rate policy.\n\nJapan and China were accused by Trump of intentionally weakening their currencies in his first term as president. A series of tit-for-tat US-China tariff announcements drove the Chinese currency down more than 12pc against the dollar between March 2018 and May 2020.\n\nRecently, China has focused on stabilising its currency’s moves. The yuan, or renminbi, inched higher against the dollar on Tuesday as the central bank continued to guide the currency firmer — a move some analysts saw as aimed at easing friction with Washington.\n\n“China and Japan are not keeping their currencies cheap, and in fact they are doing the opposite,” said Chang Wei Liang, currency and credit strategist at DBS.\n\n“We see China and Japan as being aligned with the US in terms of not wanting to see excessive renminbi and yen weakness.”\n\nJapanese policymakers, for their part, have been sensitive to the risk of Trump making explicit comments about the yen and causing market volatility that could hurt a fragile economic recovery.\n\nWhile a weak yen boosts Japanese exports, Tokyo’s recent forays in the currency market aimed to prevent sharp yen falls that inflate import costs and hurt consumption.\n\nLast week, Japan’s top currency diplomat, Atsushi Mimura, acknowledged the yen’s rebound at the time as reflecting the country’s solid economic fundamentals and prospects of a near-term interest rate hike by the central bank.\n\nJapan has consistently, and successfully, urged G7 and G20 members to reaffirm their pact that excessive volatility in the currency market is undesirable - language Tokyo sees as giving it justification for yen intervention when the currency’s moves are too sharp and driven by speculative trade.\n\nTrump’s criticism of a weak yen and uncertainty on how his tariff threats could affect global growth may complicate the Bank of Japan’s decision on how soon to raise interest rates.\n\nSome analysts expect Trump’s displeasure over a weak yen to work in favour of further interest rate hikes from the Bank of Japan.\n\n“Japan can’t conduct yen-buying, dollar-selling intervention at current yen levels, so the pressure will pile on the BOJ to hike rates,” said Hiroyuki Machida, director of Japan FX and commodities sales at ANZ.\n\n“Trump’s comments give investors reason to buy yen” on bets the BOJ could raise interest rates twice this year, he said.\n\nThe central bank ended a decade-long, massive stimulus last year on the view that Japan was on the cusp of sustainably pulling out of prolonged deflation and economic stagnation.\n\nWith inflation exceeding its target of 2pc for nearly three years, the BOJ is eyeing further interest rate hikes after raising borrowing costs to 0.5pc in January.\n\nA majority of economists polled by Reuters expect the BOJ to hike rates once more this year, most probably during the third quarter, to 0.75pc.",
