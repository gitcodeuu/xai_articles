It said the pope had resumed “non-invasive mechanical ventilation” in the afternoon — the use of an oxygen mask — noting that he was “alert, focused and cooperative.” As it has since the start of the pope’s hospitalisation, the Vatican said Pope Francis’s prognosis remains “reserved,” an indication that doctors cannot predict the likely outcome of his condition.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the Vatican had said the pope’s condition was stable, after he suffered a breathing crisis on Friday. The leader of the world’s almost 1.4 billion Catholics had required the oxygen mask on Friday and Saturday, but not on Sunday, when he participated in mass and spent the rest of the day alternating rest with prayer.\n\nPope Francis had also on Sunday received Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, and Edgar Pena Parra, a Venezuelan archbishop who is also a senior Vatican official. The Jesuit, who has been pope since March 2013, is being treated in a special suite reserved for pontiffs on the 10th floor of the Gemelli.\n\nPope Francis, born Jorge Bergoglio, missed his traditional Angelus prayer for a third straight Sunday and the Vatican issued a written text instead. In it, the pope thanked well-wishers for their prayers, saying: “I feel all your affection and closeness and, at this particular time, I feel as if I am ‘carried’ and supported by all God’s people. Thank you all.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
