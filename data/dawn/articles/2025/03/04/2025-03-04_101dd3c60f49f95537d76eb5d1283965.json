He said there was an urgent need to improve seed quality to ensure self-sufficiency in food production.\n\nWhen the senator raised private sector’s concerns over the establishment of a new authority for the fruit and vegetable industry, the ministry officials replied that the proposed authority would promote the use of digital technology to boost productivity in the agriculture sector.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
