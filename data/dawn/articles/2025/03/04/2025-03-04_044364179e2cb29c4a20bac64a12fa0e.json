  "content": "GILGIT / ISLAMABAD: The World Wildlife Day on March 3 passed without any major event to mark the occasion in Gilgit-Baltistan, a region famed for its picturesque landscapes and biodiversity.\n\nUnlike in the past, no ceremonies or events were organised by the government or non-government organisations in Gilgit-Baltistan this year.\n\nGB is rich in flora and fauna because of its varied climatic conditions and ecosystem.\n\nThe region is home to several rare species, such as marco polo sheep, ibex, markhor, urial, blue sheep, lynx, snow leopard, leopard cat, brown and black bears, wolf, fox, marmot, chakor and ram chakor and golden eagle. Some of these species were on the brink of extinction due to illegal and unchecked hunting, negligence of the wildlife department and climate change-related issues.\n\nAccording to a statement by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), World Wildlife Day served as a reminder of the deep connection between wildlife and people.\n\nEnvironmentalists censure govt, NGOs for not raising awareness; PM stresses importance of biodiversity\n\n“As we face environmental challenges, it’s crucial to remember how our future is intertwined with the health of the planet.”\n\nIn a statement, UNDP Pakistan said that World Wildlife Day was a celebration of “Pakistan’s rich biodiversity,” from snow leopards in the northern mountains to the endangered Indus River dolphins.\n\nEnvironmentalists have criticised the GB government for not commemorating the day.\n\nAbbas Ahmed, an activist, said the GB government and non-government organisations were spending millions of rupees annually on the conservation of wildlife species. “In contrast, no practical measures have been taken to create awareness among locals.”\n\nAnother environmentalist, Ashfaq Ahmed, said illegal poaching of wildlife species was underway across GB. Many snow leopards were killed illegally while the hunting of ibex was also going on.\n\nPM’s message\n\nIn his message on World Wildlife Day, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said Pakistan was investing in a sustainable future.\n\nPM Shehbaz said Pakistan was blessed with immense biodiversity, from snow leopards to blind dolphins.\n\n“These species are not just part of our natural heritage. They play a vital role in maintaining ecological balance and sustaining our environment and economy.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
