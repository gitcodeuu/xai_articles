While the market forces and chain of supply are stated to be the key factors behind the price hike, a weak oversight by the administration —which doesn’t have ample staff to take action against the profiteers across the city — leaves people at the mercy of retailers.\n\nIn 2023, over 100 section officers (SOs) of different provincial departments had been given magisterial powers to take action against profiteering and hoarding during Ramazan in Karachi alone.\n\nPresiding over a high-level meeting on price control, the CM issued strict directives to regulate the prices of essential commodities across the province, emphasising that artificial price hikes and hoarding would not be tolerated.\n\nAccording to a press statement issued from the CM House, the chief minister reminded the officials that the anti-profiteering law empowered the government to seize and auction hoarded goods to prevent market manipulation. He therefore directed the administration to ensure seizure of the hoarded goods and auction them under the law.\n\nThe Karachi commissioner informed the meeting that over 250 “Bachat Bazaars” (discount markets) were operating in the city to provide relief to citizens. The CM stressed that these markets must be well-organised and effectively regulated to ensure smooth operations and prevent traffic congestion.\n\nMr Shah also directed the deputy commissioners, through divisional commissioners, to regularly visit markets to monitor prices and curb unnecessary inflation.\n\nHe ordered that price lists be printed and distributed promptly and instructed officials to monitor price compliance closely throughout Ramazan. Additionally, he emphasised that major retail stores should also be compelled to maintain reasonable prices.\n\nConcern over utilities\n\nExpressing concern over gas shortages, the chief minister demanded its uninterrupted supply during Ramazan.\n\nHe also instructed the mayor to ensure adequate water supply in the city and directed the energy minister to immediately contact power distribution companies to stop electricity outages.\n\nTampered vehicles\n\nDuring another meeting, the chief minister directed Excise Minister Mukesh Chawla to begin impounding non-customs paid (NCP) vehicles and those with tampered chassis numbers that were being operated in the city.\n\nThe excise minister informed the CM that his department had already impounded four vehicles being used by customs officers in the city.\n\nHe said that these vehicles did not have valid number plates, and their chassis numbers had been tampered with.\n\nThe chief minister issued clear directives to both the excise police and the district police to take action against such vehicles, impound them, and report back to him.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Provincial Ministers Sharjeel Memon, Nasir Shah, Zia Lanjar, Special Assistant for the Bureau of Supply & Prices Usman Ghani Hingoro, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah, Principal Secretary Agha Wasif, Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, Sindh police chief Ghulam Nabi Memon, Agriculture Secretary Sohail Qureshi, while the Commissioners of Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Shaheed Benazirabad, Sukkur, and Larkana participated via video link.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
