Holding pictures of the detained scholars, the protesters chanted slogans demanding their release.\n\nOpposition leader, clerics demand their ‘unconditional’ release\n\nThe three scholars were returning from Iran and had entered Pakistan through the Rimdan-Gabd border crossing in Balochistan when they were allegedly detained by police on February 25.\n\nSince then, there has been no contact, raising serious concerns among their families and the community.\n\nOn Sunday, despite rain and snowfall, a large number of local people, including women, staged a sit-in blocking Kargil Road. Similarly, a large gathering of women staged a protest on K2 Road against the detention of the religious scholars. Earlier, a protest demonstration was also held in Gamba, Skardu, demanding the release of the scholars.\n\nThe protesters condemned the arrests, stating that the detention of the three religious scholars was unjustified and without any crime. They urged the government to conduct an immediate investigation and ensure the safe return of the detained scholars.\n\nMr Mesum warned that there would be strong reactions across Baltistan over the arrest and shifting of the scholars to an unknown location. In a statement, he said the federal government would have to face consequences for the ill-treatment of the residents of Gilgit-Baltistan. He demanded the immediate release of the scholars.\n\nMeanwhile, Anjuman-i-Imamia Baltistan has announced that protests will intensify if the detained scholars were not released.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
