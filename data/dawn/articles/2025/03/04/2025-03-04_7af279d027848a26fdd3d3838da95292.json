However, the police, equipped with thermal imaging cameras, identified the attackers and responded with machine guns and mortar fire. The attackers were forced to retreat, and reports suggest they suffered heavy casualties.\n\nInspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar said this was the 18th attack by militants that the Punjab police had foiled.\n\nEarlier this year, on Jan 31, a similar attack on the Jhangi police check post in the vicinity of Wahowa police station was also thwarted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
