  "content": "ISLAMABAD: While an anti-terrorism court approved the post-arrest bail applications of 56 PTI workers in cases related to the Nov 26 protest at D-Chowk, on Monday, a court of judicial magistrate issued arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub and others in a separate case.\n\nATC Judge Abual Hasnat Mohammad Zulqarnain granted the bail after hearing arguments from both sides.\n\nThe cases against the PTI activists had been registered at Tarnol and Kohsar police stations.\n\nArrest warrants issued\n\nA court of judicial magistrate is­­su­­ed arrest warrants for PTI leaders Omar Ayub, Aamir Dogar, and Aamir Mughal over their continuous non-appearance in a case rela­ted to the violation of Section 144.\n\nDuring the hearing, the court accepted the applications for exemption from personal appearance submitted by PTI Chair­man Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Shoaib Shaheen.\n\nBarrister Gohar had formally filed a request for exemption, which the court approved.\n\nHowever, arguments on the acquittal applications of the accused could not be presented, leading the court to adjourn the proceedings until April 23. The case pertains to two FIRs registered against Barrister Gohar and others at the I-9 police station.\n\nIn a related development, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) ordered the removal of the name of Umar Sultan, the former official in charge of security of ex-premier Imran Khan, from the Passport Control List, declaring his inclusion in the travel ban list as “unjustified and illegal”.\n\nJustice Muhammad Asif issued a written order approving Mr Sultan’s petition, stating that there was no record showing his name was placed on the list with the federal government’s approval.\n\nThe court observed the inclusion of his name in the PCL violated his fundamental constitutional rights.\n\nAccording to a report by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), Umar Sultan’s name was active in both the PCL and the Exit Control List. According to the directorate general of immigration and passports, it was based on a recommendation from the Additional Inspector General due to multiple FIRs against him. His name was officially added to the travel ban list on August 24, 2023.\n\nHowever, the court noted that the ATC had already granted Mr Sultan bail on April 18, 2024. Based on these findings, the IHC ruled that his inclusion in the travel ban list was illegal and ordered the authorities to immediately remove his name.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
