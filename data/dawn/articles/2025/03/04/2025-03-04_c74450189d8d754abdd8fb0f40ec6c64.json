The attack was effectively countered by soldiers deployed at the checkpoints, the sources said.\n\nSecurity forces managed to kill 13 terrorists while several others were reportedly injured, the sources said, adding that the remaining terrorists managed to flee under the cover of darkness with the bodies of their fellows.\n\nCoordinated attacks on six checkpoints countered; 13 terrorists killed, sources say\n\nHowever, during the exchange of fire, four security personnel embraced martyrdom, while 13 sustained injuries.\n\nThe martyred and injured security personnel were shifted to Miramshah headquarters hospital, while the ones critically wounded were referred to the Combined Military Hospital in Bannu.\n\nMeanwhile, additional troops arrived in the area and started a search operation to trace the terrorists, the sources said.\n\nThe military’s media wing, Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), has not released any statement on the attack till the filing of this report.\n\nSecurity personnel have repeatedly been attacked by terrorists in North Waziristan, which borders Afghanistan, over the past few months.\n\nOnly last week, two soldiers were martyred when a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden car into their convoy in the Eidak area.\n\nAt least 10 people, inclu­ding two civilians, were injured in the attack, which destroyed the vehicle completely.\n\nEarlier on Feb 24, four security personnel were martyred in an attack on a checkpoint in Spinwam tehsil of North Waziristan.\n\nThe early morning attack was retaliated by security forces, leading to a heavy exchange of fire.\n\nSecurity officials have also claimed foreign interference in these attacks.\n\nLast month, ISPR said that an Afghan national who was involved in terrorism inside Pakistan was killed during an operation in North Waziristan. Security forces have intensified operations against terrorists in the district.\n\nOn Feb 28, ISPR said six terrorists were killed in an intelligence-based operation in the Ghulam Khan Kalay area.\n\nDuring the counter-terrorism operations in February, 156 terrorists were killed and 66 were arrested, the highest since the December 2023 figure of 139.\n\nMost of these arrests, 50, were made from the erstwhile Fata region, while 16 from Punjab.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
