Hamas rejected the idea of any proposal being imposed on Palest­inians by other states.\n\nUnder the Egyptian plan, a Governance Assi­stance Mission would replace the Hamas-run government in Gaza and would be responsible for humanitarian aid and for kick-starting reconstruction. “There will be no major international funding for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Gaza if Hamas remains the dominant and armed political element on the ground controlling local governance,” a preamble outlining the draft said.\n\nEgypt, Jordan and Gulf Arab states have for been scrambling to formulate a diplomatic offe­n­sive to counter Trump’s plan. A number of ideas have been proposed, with Egypt’s considered the frontrunner. The plan does not specify who would run the governance mission. It said it would, “draw on the expertise of Palestinians in Gaza and elsewhere to help Gaza recover as quickly as possible”.\n\nStabilisation force\n\nSenior Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters the group knows of no such proposal by Egypt.\n\n“The day after in Gaza must only be decided by the Palestinians,” he said.\n\n“Hamas rejects any attempt to impose projects or any form of non-Palestinian administration, or the presence of any foreign forces on the land of the Gaza Strip.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
