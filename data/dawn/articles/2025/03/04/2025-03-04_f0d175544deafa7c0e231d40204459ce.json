The condition of one of the injured is stated to be serious.\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi paid homage to the martyr and extended condolences to the bereaved family. CM Bugti said terrorism and cowardly acts could not affect the province’s peace and stability.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, CM Bugti while talking to the media in Quetta expressed alarm over the security situation in Balochistan.\n\nHe said the rise in acts of terrorism is the result of the previous government’s policy of appeasement of militant groups like the banned TTP, noting that several Taliban ‘commanders’ released during Imran Khan’s tenure had re-established their camps.\n\nAdmitting that the security situation in Balochistan is alarming, the chief minister pledged that terrorists will not be allowed to control even an inch of land of the province.\n\nHe said that the influx of weapons from Afghanistan after the US withdrawal had exacerbated the situation in Balochistan, with terrorists now using thermal technology to carry out attacks from up to two kilometres away.\n\nThe CM, however, expressed the confidence that his government would soon bring acts of terrorism under control through smart strategies, emphasising the need for increased federal government’s support to enhance the capacity of law-enforcement agencies.\n\nHe also mentioned plans to upgrade security in “B Areas” to “A Areas” to improve governance and security. He announced that an Apex Committee meeting has been called for Tuesday (today) to formulate a strategy, and underperforming deputy commissioners will be replaced immediately.\n\nMissing persons’ issue\n\nDiscussing the issue of missing persons, Mr Bugti described it as highly complex, suggesting that some groups involved in forcibly blocking roads might be behind disappearances of people to put pressure on the provincial government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
