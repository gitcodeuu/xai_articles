  "content": "LAHORE: Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz on Monday formally launched the free solar panel scheme for those consuming up to 200 units per month by conducting a digital balloting.\n\nThe Punjab chief minister directed the relevant authorities to complete the solar panel installation process as soon as possible. “We want to provide maximum relief to the people from expensive electricity and there should be no delay in this regard. The free solar panel scheme should be completed at the earliest,” she said.\n\nOn this occasion, the chief minister was informed that after physical verification, the installation of solar systems would start across the province by the end of March. The first phase of the free solar panel scheme installation would be completed by the end of July.\n\nCM Maryam was briefed that 94,483 solar panel systems would be installed in the first phase under the ‘CM Punjab Free Solar Panel Scheme’.\n\nOver 94,000 solar panel systems to be installed in the first phase, CM Maryam told\n\n“Solar systems will be installed free of charge for consumers consuming up to 200 units per month in the province. Some 861,000 consumers have applied for obtaining free solar panel scheme.\n\n“The entire process of the free solar panel scheme will be completed through end-to-end digitization. Some 471,82 systems of 0.55 kW and 47,301 systems of 1.1 kW will be installed under the scheme. Consumers consuming 100 units per month and up to 200 units per month will be given free solar systems.\n\n“Verification will be done using the reference number and CNIC number listed on the consumer’s monthly bill. A helpline has also been set up to assist and facilitate the consumers who receive free solar panels,” the chief minister was informed.\n\nThe chief minister was also told that the provision of solar panels and inverters would be linked to the computerised national identity card of consumers to ensure transparent distribution. “Installing 100,000 solar systems in Punjab will reduce carbon emissions by 57,000 tonnes. The free solar panel scheme will also reduce the burden of subsidy on the federal government,” she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 4th, 2025",
