They also advocated for centralised insurance taxation to ensure consistent treatment and eliminate double taxation at the provincial level.\n\nAurangzeb assures CEOs their proposals will be considered\n\nAn official announcement issued after the meeting said the finance minister assured the CEOs that the government would carefully consider their proposals, particularly regarding taxation and policy measures necessary for the future growth of the industry.\n\nMr Aurangzeb highlighted that the consultative process for the upcoming federal budget had been deliberately advanced this year, adding that over 90 per cent of the process had already been completed, with recommendations, proposals and suggestions received from various stakeholders, including the insurance sector.\n\nThe minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting the insurance sector, recognising its potential for significant private sector investment. He noted that the government seeks to diversify beyond the banking sector for lending purposes, urging the insurance industry to step up and meet the growing demand.\n\nThis includes expanding the sector by focusing on innovation, enhancing productivity and driving further growth.\n\nThe minister assured the delegation that the government would continue to work closely with industry leaders and stakeholders to ensure long-term prosperity of the insurance sector, which is a vital component of Pakistan’s economic landscape.\n\nThe discussion focused on the growth of the insurance sector and its contributions to the national economy, with a particular emphasis on its impact on the health system, investments in Pakistan Investment Bonds, capital markets and long-term investment opportunities.\n\nThe delegation’s presentation also highlighted the current statistics of the industry, which boasts assets worth Rs2.900 trillion, alongside 20,000 direct and 234,000 indirect employments. The sector’s contributions were underscored, with Rs613 billion in gross written premiums and Rs373bn in claims paid to date.\n\nThe finance minister emphasised that a team of experts at the Federal Board of Revenue is diligently reviewing each proposal submitted by different sectors, ensuring that the impact on the economy and revenue is thoroughly evaluated. This process aims to develop realistic and actionable policy interventions that will foster the growth of the industry and critical sectors of the economy, added the announcement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 11th, 2025",
