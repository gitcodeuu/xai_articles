  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) on Monday launched Pakistan’s first dematerialised ID card as it commemorated 25 years of excellence in legal identity management and national database integration.\n\nThe national identity document will now be integrated as a feature into the Pak ID mobile application, which means that citizens will no longer need to carry physical ID cards.\n\nMoreover, digital verification systems will soon be implemented to facilitate authentication for various services under the World Bank-funded Digital Economy Enhancement Project (DEEP). A pilot project for this fully digital identity will be launched on August 14, 2025.\n\nA ceremony was held at the Nadra headquarters to mark the silver jubilee of the authority.\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif sent congratulatory messages, appreciating Nadra’s remarkable achievements. A commemorative coin issued by the State Bank of Pakistan and a special postage stamp by Pakistan Post were unveiled to mark the historic milestone.\n\nPresident Zardari lauded the authority’s role in providing a legal and unique identity to citizens, reinforcing the social contract between the state and its people while transforming public service delivery. He urged Nadra to accelerate its efforts to utilise emerging technologies to improve efficiency and uphold the highest standards of integrity, accessibility and citizen satisfaction.\n\nPrime Minister Sharif recognised Nadra’s pivotal role in empowering citizens. He highlighted its global standing in serving the third-largest demographic segment in the world. Acknowledging its achievements in data integration and AI modeling, the prime minister underscored the significance of digital solutions in driving economic growth and promoting inclusivity.\n\nMinister for Interior and Narcotics Control Syed Mohsin Raza Naqvi commended the launch of the dematerialised ID as a step towards digital identity.\n\nIn his message, he highlighted Nadra’s extensive network, ensuring identity services are available even in the remotest areas of Pakistan as well as for overseas Pakistanis. He also acknowledged Nadra’s crucial contributions to governance and law enforcement, reinforcing national security and public administration.\n\nNadra’s founding chairman retired Maj Gen Zahid Ehsan was the chief guest at the silver jubilee ceremony.\n\nIn his address, he shared a brief reflection on the organisation’s early days, highlighting its rapid progress in achieving the vision it was founded upon. He said the institution continues to set new milestones in its development, demonstrating its commitment to innovation and excellence.\n\nPrevious chairmen, board members, special secretary interior, chief statistician (PBS), DG immigration and passport and Nadra officials also attended the ceremony.\n\nThe event also featured the screening of a documentary film and a book launch chronicling Nadra’s 25-year journey.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 11th, 2025",
