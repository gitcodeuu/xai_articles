  "content": "LAHORE: Amid Pakistan cricket’s ongoing decline — evidenced by the national team’s dismal performances in the last three International Cri­cket Council events, including two World Cups and the Champions Trophy — the Pakistan Cricket Board appears reluctant to adopt a fresh approach.\n\nInstead of prioritising young talent in the upcoming National T20 Cup, scheduled to begin this month, the PCB included veteran players Shoaib Malik (43), Wahab Riaz (39), and Sarfaraz Ahmed (37) in the squads for Sialkot, Karachi, and Lahore, respectively despite the trio serving as those sides’ mentors.\n\nThe inclusion of these senior players drew widespread criticism, leading to the withdrawal of Wahab and Sarfraz from their respective teams on Monday. However, Shoaib Malik remains part of the Sialkot squad.\n\nWahab, a former left-arm pacer, has held multiple roles within the PCB since 2023. Currently serving as head of the board’s five-member mentorship panel, he oversees a group featuring Pakistan cricket stalwarts such as Waqar Younis, Misbah-ul-Haq, Saqlain Mushtaq, Sarfraz, and Shoaib. These mentors, each managing one of the “Champions” teams, are reportedly earning substantial monthly salaries.\n\nInitially appointed as chief selector by then-PCB chairman Zaka Ashraf on an ad-hoc basis, Wahab was later retained by current chairman Mohsin Naqvi. He was subsequently appointed as a member of the national selection committee and given the dual role of senior team manager for the 2024 ICC T20 World Cup. Now, as head of the mentorship program, he was initially listed to play in the National T20 Cup before opting out.\n\nThe Lahore Regional Cricket Association has replaced Wahab with Ahmad Bashir, according to an official.\n\nMeanwhile, Sialkot’s head coach Mansoor Amjad confirmed Shoaib’s retention, explaining that the decision aligns with a strategy of “infield mentoring” — a move aimed at helping young players learn from experienced cricketers during matches.\n\n“Shoaib Malik is included in the Sialkot team as part of an infield mentoring strategy, which has never been implemented before. It is expected to benefit young players,” Mansoor said.\n\nA PCB spokesperson defended the selection, stating that under the mentors’ contracts, they are required to serve 224 days annually, with the remaining days available for playing or media engagements. He added that if a regional team chose to include a mentor as a player, the board had no objections.\n\nNotably, several PCB mentors also serve as television analysts, frequently critiquing the national team’s performances. The ethical dilemma of mentors — tasked with developing Pakistan’s cricketing future — simultaneously assessing the same team on TV raises questions about potential conflicts of interest.\n\nMeanwhile, the cash-strapped PCB has drastically reduced match fees for National T20 Cup players, slashing payments from Rs100,000 per match to Rs10,000 for those in the playing XI and Rs5,000 for reserves.\n\nSignificant financial resources have been allocated to stadium renovations, including work at Gaddafi Stadium, National Stadium, Karachi, and the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium.\n\nHowever, outstanding payments from last season remain due to players and umpires. Additionally, the PCB has yet to implement an annual pension increase for former Test cricketers, as mandated by board policy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 11th, 2025",
