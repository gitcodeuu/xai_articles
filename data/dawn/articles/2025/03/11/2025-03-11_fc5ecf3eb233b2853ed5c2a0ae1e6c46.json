  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has once again approached the Lahore High Court seeking permission to hold a public gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan on March 22.\n\nThe petition, filed by PTI-Punjab Vice President Akmal Khan Bari through Advocate Latif Khosa, highlighted that despite the court order, the Punjab home secretary did not decide on the petitioner’s request for the gathering.\n\nIt pointed out that the court had previously directed the petitioner to avail the first remedy by approaching the grievance redress commissioner. It said the petitioner submitted an application to the chief secretary to avail the remedy but the application was decided by the authority.\n\nThe petition stated that no intimation or notice had been received by the petitioner till date from the authority regarding deciding or any hearing of the application.\n\nIt has pleaded that the PTI intends to organise a peaceful rally but the authorities have been delaying the grant of permission.\n\nThe petitioner asked the court to direct the government to allow the gathering at Minar-i-Pakistan on March 22.\n\nJustice Farooq Haider had, on Feb 24, sustained an office’s objection to the PTI’s petition seeking permission for a public gathering with a direction to the petitioner to approach the grievance redress commissioner of the government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 11th, 2025",
