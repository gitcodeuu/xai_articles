Tuesday’s talks between Ukrainian officials and Rubio’s US team will be the first between the two sides since the White House blow-up, when Zelensky left without signing a minerals deal demanded by Trump.\n\nWashington has since suspended military aid to Ukraine as well as intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery. “We do have a proposal for a ceasefire in the sky and ceasefire at sea,” a Ukrainian official said on Monday. “Because these are the ceasefire options that are easy to install and to monitor, and it’s possible to start with them.”\n\nRubio indicated the idea had promise. “I’m not saying that alone is enough, but it’s the kind of concession you would need to see in order to end the conflict,” he told reporters. “You’re not going to get a ceasefire and an end to this war unless both sides make concessions.”\n\nTrump says US has ‘just about’ ended pause on Ukraine intel sharing\n\nRubio added that he hoped to “resolve” the suspension of military aid that is threatening to hamper Ukraine’s campaign. “I think the notion of the pause in aid, broadly, is something I hope we can resolve. Obviously, what happens tomorrow will be key to that,” he said.\n\nZelensky was expected to meet the de facto Saudi ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman later before his officials sit down with the US side on Tuesday.\n\nBritain’s Financial Times newspaper, citing a source briefed on preparations for the talks, said Kyiv’s offer of a partial ceasefire was aimed at convincing Washington to resume military aid and intelligence-sharing. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer told Trump in a call on Monday that he hoped the talks would lead to the US resuming military aid to Ukraine, Downing Street said.\n\nBefore his departure for Jeddah, Zelensky said Ukraine wanted peace, insisting Russia was the sole reason that the war was carrying on. “Ukraine has been seeking peace since the very first second of the war, and we have always said that the only reason that the war is continuing is because of Russia,” he wrote on social media.\n\nUS Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff said Washington wanted to use the talks “to get down a framework for a peace agreement and an initial ceasefire as well”. In Jeddah, several Ukrainian and Saudi flags flew on a main roundabout near the airport and on thoroughfares.\n\nAs well as Rubio, Mike Waltz, Trump’s national security adviser, has also confirmed his participation. Zelensky said his negotiators will include Foreign Minister Andriy Sybiga and Defence Minister Rustem Umerov, his chief of staff Andriy Yermak and Pavlo Palisa, a military commander and Yermak’s deputy.\n\nSuspension of intelligence sharing ban\n\nTrump said on Sunday that the United States had “just about” ended a suspension of intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Asked if he would consider ending the suspension, Trump said, “We just about have. We just about have.”\n\nCIA Director John Ratcliffe said on Wednesday the US had halted intelligence sharing with Ukraine, piling pressure on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy to cooperate with Trump in convening peace talks with Russia. The suspension, which could cost lives by hurting Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russian missile strikes, followed a halt to US military aid to Kyiv.\n\nZelenskiy and Trump had been slated to sign the minerals accord — which would give the US access to certain mineral resources in Ukraine — before Zelenskiy’s White House visit erupted into a clash between the two leaders, after which it was not signed. Trump said the thought Ukraine would sign the minerals agreement, which Ukraine wants to contain a US security guarantee.\n\n“They will sign the minerals deal but I want them to want peace… They haven’t shown it to extent they should,” he said. Trump also said his administration was looking at a variety of things with respect to tariffs on Russia and that administration officials are not concerned about military exercises involving Russia, China and Iran.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 11th, 2025",
