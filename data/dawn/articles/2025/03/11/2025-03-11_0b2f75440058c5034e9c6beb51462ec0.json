Barrister Raja responded that he was ac­­c­u­­sed of being involved in an attack on a police station.\n\nWith a smile on his face, the acting chief justice remarked, “So you sho­­uld not do such a thing. Then, you know, it is said about you that you talk a lot.”\n\nMr Raja expressed surprise over the issuance of arrest warrant for him despite his regular court appearances. He cited SC’s ruling in Sughra Bibi case as a precedent, arguing that issuance of non-bailable arrest warrant was “unwarranted”.\n\nThe court noted the seriousness of the matter and assured that the objection from the registrar’s office would be removed, scheduling the next hearing for Wednesday upon the petitioner’s request.\n\nHighlighting irregularities in the case, Barrister Raja argued that an FIR had been registered against 100 individuals, whose whereabouts remained unknown. Despite this, the authorities were actively investigating and issuing warrants.\n\nFollowing the initial arguments, the court suspended the arrest warrant and issued notices to the relevant parties.\n\nEarlier during the hearing, the court inquired about the deputy attorney general’s presence before the bench. Later, when Assistant Attorney General Usman Ghuman appeared before the bench, Justice Dogar emphasised that the court order must be implemented.\n\nThe hearing was subsequently adjour­ned for two weeks, with directions for all parties to submit their responses within the given time frame.\n\nBail granted\n\nSeparately, the court of judicial magistrate Ahmed Shehzad Gondal granted bail to nine PTI workers, who were arrested in connection with the Nov 26 protest, on a set of bail applications.\n\nAt the hearing, the counsel for the petitioners argued that the high court had already granted bail to other accused individuals in the same case. Citing Arti­cle 201 of the Constitution, he asserted that the court was legally bound to grant bail under similar circumstances.\n\nNone of the accused were arrested at the scene, he claimed, adding that they should be released forthwith as the police no longer required their custody for investigation.\n\nPolice get MPA’s custody\n\nOn the other hand, an ATC extended physical remand of a PTI member of the provincial assembly, elected from Swat, for another day in the Sangjani jalsa case.\n\nMPA Ali Shah was produced before Ju­­dge Abual Hasanat Mohammad Zulqar­n­ain, after the expiry of his two-day physical remand. The judge granted the requ­e­­st of the prosecution that sought an extension in custody for further investigation.\n\nThe Khyber Pakhtunkhwa assembly lawmaker faces terrorism charges in a case registered at the Sangjani police station. The ATC directed the police to produce the MPA on Tuesday. In a separate case, registered at Islamabad’s Kohsar police station, the court granted him bail against a surety bond of Rs5,000 after reviewing arguments from both sides.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 11th, 2025",
