The whole world is watching you in Jeddah today. Good luck!” Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk wrote on X.\n\nUkraine overnight launched its biggest drone attack on Moscow yet, deploying at least 91 drones, killing at least three people, sparking fires, closing airports and forcing dozens of flights to be diverted, Russian officials said.\n\nThe strike — in which 337 drones were downed over Russia, according to Moscow — appeared aimed at showing Kyiv can also land major blows after a steady stream of Russian missile and drone attacks, one of which killed 14 people on Saturday.\n\nIt comes as Zelenskiy has been calling on his European allies to support the air and sea truce idea that he says would be a chance to test Moscow’s willingness to end the war.\n\nAs the diplomacy plays out, Ukraine’s battlefield positions are under heavy pressure, particularly in Russia’s Kursk region where Moscow’s forces have launched a push to flush out Kyiv’s troops, which had been trying to hold a patch of land as a bargaining chip.\n\nZelenskiy’s Oval Office clash with Trump left the signing of a bilateral minerals deal in limbo and Kyiv’s bid to obtain security guarantees from Washington adrift.\n\nTrump has framed the deal, which is set to be discussed on Tuesday, as key to continued US support and compensation for many billions of dollars in US military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded three years ago.\n\nAhead of the talks, Yermak told reporters that security guarantees remained key for Ukraine, but suggested they might only look at that in a preliminary way on Tuesday.\n\n“Most important is how to start this process and we are very open,” he said.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters on Monday en route to Jeddah that the talks with Kyiv would be important to gauge if Ukraine is willing to make concessions to reach peace.\n\n“We have to understand the Ukrainian position and just have a general idea of what concessions they’d be willing to make, because you’re not going to get a ceasefire and an end to this war unless both sides make concessions,” he said.\n\nThe top US diplomat is being joined at the talks by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz. Zelenskiy, who was in Saudi Arabia on Monday to meet with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, is not joining the talks.\n\nTrump’s Special Envoy for the Middle East Steve Witkoff, who has been drafted into Ukraine diplomacy, said he was hopeful the US-Ukraine minerals deal would be signed soon.\n\nWitkoff plans to visit Moscow to meet President Vladimir Putin, a person briefed on the plans said on Monday.\n\nUkraine’s European allies argue that Kyiv can only negotiate a peace deal with Russia from a position of strength and that it should not be rushed to the bargaining table with an aggressor.\n\nZelenskiy has said that Putin does not want peace and warned that Russia could attack other European countries if its invasion of Ukraine does not result in a clear defeat.\n\nRubio declined on Monday to specify concessions each side would have to make but said Kyiv would have difficulty reclaiming all of its lost territory.\n\nRussia holds around a fifth of Ukraine’s territory, including Crimea, which it annexed in 2014, and its troops are pressing on the eastern Donetsk region.\n\nUS and Russian officials met in the Saudi capital in February in a rare encounter between the former Cold War foes. The discussions were focused largely on restoring ties after a near-total freeze on official contact under former US president Joe Biden, Trump’s predecessor.",
