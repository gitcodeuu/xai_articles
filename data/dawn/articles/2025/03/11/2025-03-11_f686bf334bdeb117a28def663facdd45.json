  "content": "LONDON: A lawmaker suspended from Britain’s ruling Labour party for punching a man in the street announced on Monday that he will resign as an MP, paving the way for the first electoral test of Keir Starmer’s premiership.\n\nMike Amesbury, who received a 10-week suspended jail sentence last month after admitting repeatedly punching the man during a late-night altercation in October, told the BBC he will “step aside at the earliest opportunity”.\n\nHis resignation from the northwest English seat of Runcorn and Helsby will trigger the first by-election since Labour swept to power in July last year. The party has since slumped in the polls.\n\nAmesbury has sat as an independent since Labour suspended him after the Mail Online published a video showing the assault on 45-year-old Paul Fellows in the town of Frodsham, southeast of Liverpool, shortly before 3am on October 26.\n\nA court heard Fellows had complained to Amesbury about a bridge closure. The MP apologised to the victim and his family after pleading guilty to assault in January.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 11th, 2025",
