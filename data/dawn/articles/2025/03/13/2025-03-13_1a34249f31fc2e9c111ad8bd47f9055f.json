  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh government has launched the “country’s first-ever” program to support the education of children of convicted prisoners.\n\nThe launch ceremony was held at the Karachi central prison and attended by Education Minister Sardar Ali Shah and Prisons Minister Hasan Ali Zardari.\n\nThis program is a joint initiative of the education and prisons departments and Paigham-e-Pakistan under which children of 4,684 convicted inmates across Sindh will receive educational support from primary to university level.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Minister Sardar Shah emphasised that the state must act like a mother, saying, “We are helping children who have committed no crime. Denying them education would be the greatest injustice because children should not be punished for the actions of their parents.”\n\nMinister Sardar Shah says it is the duty of state to ensure education for children of inmates\n\nHe further stated that just as it is the state’s responsibility to punish criminals, it is also the state’s duty to ensure education for their children. “We are setting a positive precedent,” he added.\n\nHe claimed that Sindh is the first province to take such an initiative, and this is the world’s first model to support inmates’ children from school to higher education.\n\nHe stated that data on prisoners’ children is being collected, and based on their families’ preferences, more than 10,000 children will be helped to enrol in schools and universities.\n\nHe clarified that inmates’ children can choose between government and private educational institutions, and the government will provide full support.\n\nIn the first phase, admission letters have been issued for 100 children, while data for 2,638 children has been collected, and they will soon receive admission letters in consultation with their families.\n\nThe provincial minister stressed the importance of filling schools with students and emptying prisons.\n\n“It is our responsibility to ensure that these children are sent to educational institutions with complete protection.”\n\nPrisons Minister Zardari said that families of inmates often live a life similar to imprisonment due to the absence of a breadwinner. “We must change the perception of prisons in Sindh into reform centres. Helping inmates’ children get education will integrate entire families into the rehabilitation process,” he said.\n\nHe noted that the program will not only support the education of children of male and female inmates but also assist juvenile inmates in gaining education and vocational skills.\n\nCurrently, there are 14 convicted juvenile inmates in Sindh and 56 children living in jail with their mothers, for whom educational initiatives are also underway.\n\nPaigham-e-Pakistan organiser Prof Muhammad Miraj Siddiqui announced that three types of programs have been proposed to support inmates’ children — Education and vocational training from primary school to university, Microfinancing of up to Rs500,000 to help inmates’ children start their own businesses and monthly financial assistance of up to Rs12,000 for families of convicted inmates to prevent criminal elements from exploiting their economic vulnerability.\n\nSindh’s prisons currently house 24,000 inmates, including 4,102 convicted inmates and 582 on death row.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 13th, 2025",
