These differences will not stop us from working for the stability and economic progress of Pakistan,” he said.\n\nThe chief minister said the establishment of law and order was most essential, as it formed the foundation of development.\n\nHe added that Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had significantly contributed to Pakistan’s development and would continue doing so.\n\nMr Gandapur said in the first six months of the current financial year, the province achieved a budget surplus of Rs169 billion and established a debt management fund of Rs70 billion.\n\nHe added that the province had successfully met the IMF target, while investments were witnessed in productive sectors.\n\nThe chief minister said significant progress had already been made, aligned with the Uraan Pakistan programme, and that the province would lead in that effort nationwide as well.\n\nTouching upon major initiatives of the provincial government, he said Rs15 billion of private investment had been secured for industrial zones.\n\nMr Gandapur said under the Insaf Rozgar Scheme, entrepreneurs were provided loans amounting to Rs200 million, which created employment opportunities for more than 137,000 individuals.\n\nHe said for the timely completion of development projects in tribal districts, the remaining funds should be released on an emergency basis.\n\n“Under PSDP, out of Rs36 billion allocated for seven projects in the province, only Rs2.65 billion has been allocated, while only Rs1 billion has been released so far. While new projects have been reflected for other provinces in PSDP, no new projects have been given to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,” he said.\n\nThe chief minister said compared with other provinces, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa received a very small share of PSDP funds compared with Sindh’s Rs49.2 billion, Punjab’s Rs7.1 billion and Balochistan’s Rs23.81 billion.\n\nHe called for an increase in the allocation of PSDP funds for the province and for the timely release of funds for the completion of PSDP projects.\n\nMr Gandapur also said the Chashma Right Bank Canal project, which was crucial for the province’s food security, had neither received appropriate funding nor had the construction of the connecting canals been carried out.\n\nHe said although Rs17.51 billion had been allocated for the project in the current fiscal, no funds had yet been released.\n\n“Our government will contribute Rs60 billion from its own resources for this project, with Rs500 million already released for the required land,” he said.\n\nThe chief minister complained that details of the project’s alignment had not been shared by the centre with the province, and the timelines agreed by Wapda for their activities had not been adhered to.\n\nHe also said the federal government promised to allocate Rs17.5 billion for the project but only Rs2.5 billion had been earmarked in the current PSDP, and even that amount had not been released.\n\nMr Gandapur announced his government’s support for the Uraan Pakistan development agenda while demanding equal investment and funding alongside the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 13th, 2025",
