Just over a hundred were freed in the first phase, and 80 more hostages were shifted to Mach after being rescued in the second phase.\n\nAround a dozen passengers, including two railway policemen, also managed to escape their captors and made it safely back to Quetta.\n\nIn all, 21 passengers lost their lives, while four FC personnel were martyred, the ISPR DG said.\n\nSpeaking to Dunya News, the ISPR chief said that army, air force, Frontier Corps and SSG personnel had taken part in the operation.\n\nHe said the area where the incident took place was quite difficult to access, being located far from road networks and settlements.\n\n“The terrorists used hostages, including women and children, as human shields,” he added.\n\nA group of armed men was patrolling the train and its surrounding areas, keeping an eye on the large numbers of passengers in their custody.\n\nSSG commandos acted carefully to save the lives of hostages, and managed to free around 68 hostages after neutralising the remaining terrorists in a gun battle, a senior security official told Dawn, adding that almost all operations had been completed and forces were now in the clearance phase.\n\n“These terrorists were in contact with their supporters and masterminds in Afghanistan during the operation via satellite phone,” Lt Gen Sharif said.\n\n“This incident changes the rules of the game, because these terrorists have no link to Balochistan or religion,” he said.\n\nDrone footage\n\nLt Gen Sharif said the army, air force, Frontier Corps and SSG personnel had taken part and recovered the hostages.\n\nISPR also released black-and-white drone footage of the location where the train was stranded, showing the area where the operation was conducted.\n\nIn the footage, three separate groups of people can be seen huddled together by the side of the train.\n\nGiving details, the ISPR chief said that the hostages had been off-loaded from the train and were sitting in separate groups — guarded by suicide bombers — making rescue efforts quite tricky.\n\nSnipers took out the bombers, he said, allowing the hostages to escape to safety. He added that none of the hostages were harmed during the operation.\n\nThe passengers who had fled to the surrounding areas during the operation are also being rounded up, he said.\n\nBogie-to-bogie clearance of the train and the surrounding was being carried out by bomb disposal and other personnel, as per standard operating procedures, Lt Gen Sharif said.\n\n‘Misinformation’\n\nCriticising the flow of misinformation online and on social media amid the incident, particularly from India, Lt Gen Sharif said that this openly displayed the “nexus between the terrorists and their masters to the whole world.”\n\n“Interestingly, some specific political elements in Pakistan also partake in such activities enthusiastically and activate their social media [teams], and instead of standing with the state, they can be seen creating baseless justifications and reasons for this horrible terrorist act,” he said.\n\n“Sadly, some elements are sacrificing the national interest due to their lust for political power,” he said.\n\nIn his remarks, Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar also condemned what he termed “propaganda spread by the Indian media”.\n\nHe criticized the Indian media for distorting facts and pushing a pre-planned narrative to mislead the public, and — without naming anyone — lashed out at people exploiting the unfortunate incident for their own agendas instead of prioritising Pakistan’s national interest, an apparent reference to the opposition PTI.\n\nHe said the language of some opposition leaders was the same as that used by the outlawed Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) and Indian media.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 13th, 2025",
