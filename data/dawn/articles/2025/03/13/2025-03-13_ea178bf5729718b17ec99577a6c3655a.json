  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal on Wedn­e­sday announced that polio eradication would be considered as a national res­ponsibility and vowed to take all possible steps during his tenure to make the country free of the virus.\n\nHe expressed these views during a visit to the National Emergency Ope­rations Centre (NEOC) for Polio where he chaired a meeting to review the government efforts for polio eradication.\n\nWhile briefing him on the current status of polio campaign and challenges, officials informed the mi­­n­­ister that a total of 74 po­­lio cases — the highest nu­­mber of cases since 2021 — were reported last year. However, the situation has improved with only six cases being detected from across the country so far this year, the officials said.\n\nIt was highlighted that a comprehensive strategy was devised in collaboration with the provinces to eliminate polio. All necessary measures are being taken to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nCalling for national uni­ty and collective action to ensure the success of this mission, Mr Kamal stated, “Ending polio is our national responsibility, and we will accelerate our efforts to protect children from lifelong disability.”\n\nHe reaffirmed strong commitment to making Pakistan polio-free, decla­ring, “With determination and collaboration, we will overcome this challenge, and I will strive to see Pakistan free from polio during my tenure.”\n\nPolio, a highly infectious viral disease, invades ner­vous system, and can cause paralysis or even death. While there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the mo­­­st effective way to prot­ect children from this crippling disease. Repeated immunisations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio free.\n\nEarlier on his arrival at the emergency centre, the health minister was recei­ved by NEOC leadership. PM’s Focal Pe­­rson for Polio Eradication Ayesha Raza Farooq was also present.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 13th, 2025",
