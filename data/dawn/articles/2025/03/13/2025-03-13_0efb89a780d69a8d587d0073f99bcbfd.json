  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A group of villagers overpowered a policeman, took him as hostage, and tore his uniform after he shot a villager during an argument on Wednesday, police said.\n\nSources told Dawn that a lone police official went to village Athal, located in the jurisdiction of the Phulgran police station, to meet a villager. Later, the policeman and the villager engaged in a harsh argument that turned violent, and the policeman pulled out his weapon and started firing. As a result, the villager sustained a bullet injury and fell to the ground. There was no word about the condition of the injured villager; however, the policeman was rescued after talks.\n\nHearing the gunshot, other villagers rushed to the spot; the policeman attempted to escape from the village. However, the villagers chased and intercepted him. The villagers beat him black and blue, snatched his weapon, and ripped his uniform.\n\nThey also made the video of the policeman, wearing only a vest. After getting the information about the issue, senior police officers along with a well-equipped police contingent, including the Counter-Terrorism Department, reached the village and cordoned it off to rescue the policeman. The villagers resisted the police operation, and both sides resorted to firing. There were reports of a few casualties but this could not be confirmed.\n\nPolice rescue official after negotiations with villagers, move him to hospital\n\nEventually, the police opened negotiations with the villagers, who agreed to release the policeman. The police official was later shifted to a hospital.\n\nA senior police officer told Dawn that the reason behind the presence of the policeman in the village was unknown. Police teams usually raid with full preparation, and a policeman never raids alone, he added.\n\nThe area where the incident took place is notorious for drug trafficking, the officer said, adding that the villager with whom the police officer argued was suspected to be involved in such illegal activities.\n\nDawn approached police officers, including IGP Ali Nasir Rizvi, for comments, but they did not reply. It may be mentioned here that in September 2013, enraged villagers lynched two policemen near Tarnol to avenge the death of a villager.\n\nThe incident took place when the two policemen intercepted a villager and found narcotics on him. On inquiry, he told police that he had purchased the stuff from a drug peddler in Doray village. The policemen headed to the village with an informer.\n\nWhen the policemen reached the village, a brawl between the villagers and policemen ensued in which a villager was killed. The death infuriated the villagers who seized the policemen and took them into a house, where they mercilessly stoned the police officials to death.\n\nThe villagers, however, claimed that four unknown persons intercepted Raja Nadeem to loot him. His resistance provoked them and one of them shot him fatally. The gunshots brought them to the scene, and enraged at seeing Raja Nadeem lying on the ground, the crowd overpowered the armed men. Despite the intervention of the village elders, the relatives and friends of the deceased vented their anger by stoning them, which resulted in the death of two officials.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 13th, 2025",
