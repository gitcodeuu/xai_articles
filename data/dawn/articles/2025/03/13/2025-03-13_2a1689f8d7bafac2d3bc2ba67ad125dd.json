However, the court still sought clarification on the matter of meetings and communication between Mr Khan and his lawyers.\n\nJustice Minhas emphasised the importance of transparency in the process and instructed the jail authorities to ensure compliance with legal provisions regarding prisoners’ rights to legal consultations.\n\nThe case was adjourned until March 28, when the court will review the rep­ort submitted by the jail administration.\n\nMeanwhile, Advocate Niazullah Niazi, spokesperson for Imran Khan, stated that, in addition to restricting meetings with lawyers, jail authorities are also not implementing the manual that allows a 72-hour meeting between spouses every 90 days. He said Mr Khan is being denied permission to speak with his children despite court orders.\n\nInterim bail extended\n\nAn anti-terrorism court (ATC) ext­e­nded the interim bail of Imran Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, in three cases related to the November 26 protests.\n\nBushra Bibi’s counsel informed Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra that she was unable to appear in court due to her detention in the £190 million case. The lawyer requested that investigators be allowed to interrogate her in jail. Gra­nting the request, the court ruled that she should not be arrested in connection with these cases until March 24.\n\nIn another case related to a protest outside the Supreme Court building, ATC Judge Abual Hasnat Mohammad Zulqarnain extended the interim bail of PTI leaders until May 5.\n\nDuring the hearing, the defence la­­wyer informed the court that a req­uest had been made to obtain CCTV footage of the protest, but no progress had been made. He urged the court to issue directives for the release of the footage.\n\nThe lawyer argued that while the ac­­cused were willing to cooperate with the investigation, their statem­e­nts had not yet been recorded. The court ord­ered the police to complete the interrogation process and ensure that the accused’s statements are documented.\n\nThe cases were registered at the Secretariat police station, where PTI leaders and lawyers face allegations related to the protest outside the Supreme Court.\n\nContempt proceedings dismissed\n\nActing Chief Justice of the Islam­abad High Court Sardar Mohammad Sarfaraz Dogar dismissed conte­m­­pt of court proceedings against 36 lawyers invol­ved in the Feb 8, 2021, attack on the Chief Justice Block.\n\nThe contempt proceedings were initiated after lawyers ransacked the chamber of then-chief justice Athar Minallah during a protest against the demolition of their alleged illegal chambers at the Islamabad District Courts.\n\nJustice Dogar scrapped the contempt proceedings after the accused lawyers submitted an unconditional apology in an affidavit.\n\nThe court was informed that the Is­­lamabad Bar Council had already dismissed the case. Advocate Babar Aw­­­an argued that the incident stem­med from a strike but was exaggerated by the police. He urged the court to close the case, as it had been ongoing for over five years.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 13th, 2025",
