However, the house had remained incomplete for over a year due to the non-holding of Senate elections for 11 seats from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n“The house is incomplete, yet key legislative actions, including the election of the Senate chairman and deputy chairman, have been carried out. How can these elections be valid when the house itself is not duly constituted?” he questioned.\n\nReading Article 60, he said that “the term of the office of the chairman or deputy chairman shall be three years from the day on which he enters in his office”. However, both officials took the oath on April 8, 2024, but their tenure would end on March 10, 2027, creating an unexplained 20-day gap in their official term.\n\nCiting Article 218, the opposition leader said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) failed to conduct the Senate election in KP. He said Article 224 stated that the election would be held on a vacant Senate within 30 days, adding that Senator Sania Nishtar’s case was a classic example of the violation of this article as her resignation was accepted after over five months.\n\nHe added that these violations invited the trial of the chief election commissioner and even Senate members under Article 6, which deals with high treason.\n\nHe claimed that the non-representation of senators from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa makes the Senate incomplete, which not only violates the constitutional scheme but also renders elections to the offices of the president and Senate chairman and deputy chairman unconstitutional.\n\nHe said the non-election of KP senators has denied the province its right to field candidates for the office of chairman and deputy chairman. He also wondered how KP senators would be elected for six years under the Constitution if one year had already gone by. Their term will end in five years if elections are held today. This will again create a constitutional dilemma.\n\nLaw minister defends govt’s stance\n\nLaw Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, in his response, said the electoral watchdog had scheduled Senate elections for all four provinces, but the KP Assembly speaker and chief minister belonging to PTI refused to summon the session necessary to administer the oath to members elected on reserved seats.\n\n“Reasons for this were not legal and constitutional but political in nature,” he said, adding that session was not summoned even on the orders of the Peshawar High Court. As a result, the election of the Senate in KP could not be held, he said.\n\nMr Tarar argued that Senate chairman and deputy chairman elections were held with a majority of the total membership, which was sufficient under the Constitution. He dismissed concerns about an incomplete house, stating that constitutional provisions did not require a full-strength Senate for these elections to proceed.\n\nHe insisted that the dissolution of the National Assembly by the PTI-backed President Arif Alvi in April 2022 on the advice of the then prime minister Imran Khan was a fit case of Article 6, but the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government avoided doing this.\n\nHowever, Senator Shibli Faraz rejected the law minister’s justification, insisting that the government’s legal position was flawed.\n\nMeanwhile, Presiding Officer Senator Irfan Siddiqui read out a clarification from the Senate Secretariat regarding Senator Sania Nishtar’s resignation, which had been cited as an example of constitutional violations.\n\nAccording to the clarification, her resignation had been submitted on Oct 28, 2023, but was delayed due to the requirement of physical verification. “No mala fide can be attributed to the constitutional and legal process,” it added.\n\nAnother highlight of the session was PTI Senator Mohsin Aziz’s plea to complete the unfinished agenda before the conclusion of the parliamentary year.\n\nHe sought the declaration of the vote count on the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Amendment Bill, which had been withheld by the deputy chairman.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 12th, 2025",
