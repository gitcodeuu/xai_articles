Luckily, he said he remained unhurt.\n\nThe judge held that the prosecution was able to prove its case against the accused on the basis of strong, convincing, coherent and reliable evidence supported and corroborated by corroborative pieces of evidence.\n\n“Keeping in view the nature and gravity of offence along with the motive, which has not been proved, as a mitigating circumstance, the accused is deemed entitled to leniency in the matter of sentence,” he pronounced.\n\nHe awarded life imprisonment to Fahimul Haq and imposed a fine of R500,000 on him as compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased.\n\nIn case of default, the convict will further undergo six months simple imprisonment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 12th, 2025",
