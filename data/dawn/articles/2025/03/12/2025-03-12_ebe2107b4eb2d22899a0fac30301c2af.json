  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) has said the closure of the Torkham border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan has affected the return and deportation of Afghan nationals.\n\nThe movement of people via the border crossing was abruptly suspended on Feb 21 after Pakistani and Afghan security forces developed differences over construction activities on both sides of the border.\n\nSince then, officials and tribal elders on both sides have been holding talks about reopening the border.\n\nAccording to the IOM data released on Monday, 6,191 Afghans returned to their country of birth through five border crossing points along the border between February 16 and 28.\n\nOf them, 3,040 or 49pc returned via the Torkham border. However, the number of Afghans who returned or were deported through the border fell by 47pc, compared to the first 15 days of February.\n\nPakistan has ordered Afghan nationals residing illegally in the country and those with Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders to leave the country by March 31 as part of its repatriation drive, which started in 2023.\n\nLast month, Dawn reported that the government had devised a plan to move registered Afghan refugees out of Islamabad and Rawal­pindi and gradually repatriate them back to their country.\n\nCumulatively, since Sept 15, 2023, 842,429 persons have returned to Afghanistan. Of them, 36,438 returned since Jan 1.\n\nAccording to the International Organisation for Migration, the fear of arrest was the biggest reason for the return, as 89pc of Afghans said they were going back to avoid legal action. Around 25pc cited the deportation of their family members as the reason.\n\nAround 32pc said they were returning due to economic factors, such as the inability to pay rent, while 26pc said they couldn’t afford utility bills.\n\nThe majority of returnees were between 18 and 59 years of age (44pc), while 31pc were between five and 17 years.\n\nMore men (52pc) than women (48pc) returned between February 16 and 28.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 12th, 2025",
