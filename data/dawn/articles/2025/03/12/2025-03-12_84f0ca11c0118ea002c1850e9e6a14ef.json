  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The father of a youth who died in a hit-and-run accident along with his friend has filed an appeal against the acquittal of the driver, who is daughter of a Supreme Court judge.\n\nShakeel Ahmed and his friend Hasnain were killed in the accident allegedly caused by rash and negligent driving by Shanzey Malik, daughter of Justice Malik Shehzad Ahmed Khan, on June 8, 2022.\n\nRafaqat Ali, the father of Shakeel, filed a petition in Islamabad High Court, pointing out loopholes in the acquittal of Ms Malik.\n\nThe FIR was lodged on June 19, 2022 with Rafaqat Ali explaining the delay due to the immense grief and trauma he faced following the sudden loss of his son. In his appeal, he accused Ms Malik and her family of using their influence to obstruct the investigation and delay the registration of the FIR.\n\nHe claimed that the police initially refused to register the case due to pressure from the Malik family, and it was only after a petition was filed that the FIR was finally registered.\n\nThe police investigation, submitted on September 10, 2024, concluded that Ms Malik was responsible for the accident. However, a judicial magistrate in Islamabad acquitted her on February 25, 2025, stating that there was no probability of conviction.\n\nThe petitioner challenged the decision, arguing that the trial court had ignored substantial evidence, including CCTV footage, eyewitness testimonies and forensic reports which allegedly linked Ms Malik to the crime. He also claimed that the court failed to consider the influence exerted by Ms Malik’s father in the investigation process.\n\nThe appeal cited several grounds for overturning the acquittal, including the court’s alleged disregard for material evidence, misinterpretation of forensic reports and failure to consider the delay in the registration of the FIR as a result of external pressure.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 12th, 2025",
