Later, we will shift the software house business elsewhere”.\n\nOn his father’s advice, the IO said, the suspect along with his accomplice, Shiraz, went into hiding in Lahore, Islamabad and Skardu.\n\nThe IO informed the court that prior to his arrest in the murder case, Armaghan was booked in at least eight other cases. He added that for the cases in which the suspect is an absconder, information has been conveyed to the concerned stations through the police control station.\n\nMeanwhile, defence counsel Abid Zaman argued that since all recoveries have been made and the seized items will be sent for forensic examination, there is no need for his client to remain in physical custody.\n\nHe further submitted that it has been over a month since the FIR was registered, yet the IO has not even submitted an interim charge sheet. The counsel moved an application under Section 173 (i) (b) of the criminal procedure code before the court.\n\nHe pleaded that the suspect should be sent to jail on judicial remand.\n\nSpecial Public Prosecutor Zulfiqar Ali Arain opposed the defence counsel’s request and argued that the prosecution required the suspect’s physical custody to obtain the password to access the recovered cell phones and other devices.\n\nHe stated that other agencies, including the Counter Terrorism Department, were interrogating the suspect in a case related to the possession of illicit weapons, which were recovered after an encounter on Feb 8.\n\nHe added that the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) were also questioning the suspect.\n\nAfter hearing both sides, the court extended the suspect’s physical custody for further seven days.\n\nIt also allowed the suspect’s parents to meet him within the court premises on the defence counsel request.\n\nThe court noted in its order that Armaghan did not reply in the affirmative when asked whether he has been maltreated by police.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 12th, 2025",
