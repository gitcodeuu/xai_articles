From the PPP side, provincial president Muhammad Ali Shah Bacha, provincial general secretary Shuja Khanzada and parliamentary leader Ahmad Karim Kundi took part in the meeting.\n\nThe meeting was convened on the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PPP Chair­man Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari.\n\nLeaders of the two parties exp­r­­­essed deep concern over the det­eriorating security situation in KP, emphasising the urgent need for measures to restore peace and stability.\n\nThe leaders also agreed to engage like-minded political parties in consultations to strengthen collaborative efforts for the province’s progress.\n\nThe meeting underscored the importance of continued dialog­­ue and consultation between the two major political parties to address the province’s issues effectively.\n\nThe leaders paid tribute to law-enforcement agencies for their sacrifices in combating terrorism and maintaining security.\n\nThe meeting criticised the KP government’s lack of response to the escalating security concerns, describing it as a matter of grave concern. The two parties vowed to keep a close watch on the situation and work together for the province’s betterment through collective efforts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 12th, 2025",
