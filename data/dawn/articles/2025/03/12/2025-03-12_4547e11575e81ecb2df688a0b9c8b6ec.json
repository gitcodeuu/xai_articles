According to reports, the attackers martyred a number of security personnel and hijacked the train. They then started checking passengers’ identities and took some of them hostage.\n\nAlthough hampered by the remoteness of the area, security forces said they had launched a massive operation to rescue the hostages. So far, 190 passengers have been rescued, as per the latest update by state-run Radio Pakistan. It added that 30 terrorists had been killed by security forces, while the operation to eliminate the remaining assailants was continuing.\n\nThere was no confirmation of the total number of casualties, but officials said that at least 10 people — including the driver of the locomotive and eight security personnel — had lost their lives as the forces engaged in a gun battle.\n\nThe attack was claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a banned terrorist nationalist outfit whose attacks have grown increasingly brazen in recent years. And while it emerged as a key perpetrator of terror attacks last year, Tuesday’s train hijacking is the first time that a terror group has used this tactic.\n\nOverall, the BLA-orchestrated attacks caused 225 fatalities in 2024, according to the Pakistan Security Report. The report added that attacks by various outlawed Baloch insurgent groups, primarily the BLA and the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF), saw a staggering 119 per cent increase, accounting for 171 incidents in Balochistan.\n\nHere is a timeline of all attacks claimed by the BLA over the last year.\n\nJanuary 30, 2024: The BLA launched three coordinated attacks using rockets and sophisticated weapons in Balochistan’s Mach town, located at a 70km distance from the provincial capital of Quetta.\n\nThe police said at least 15 rockets were fired from the nearby mountains that landed and exploded in different areas of Mach. The terrorists also attacked a security forces camp near the central jail and entered the town’s railway station. In nearby Kolpur areas, a hotel and six shops were targeted and set ablaze.\n\nDuring the ensuing gun battle between security forces and the assailants — which lasted nearly three days — 24 terrorists were killed, the military said. Four law enforcement personnel and two civilians were also martyred in the attack.\n\nMarch 20, 2024: A group of eight terrorists, belonging to the proscribed BLA, attempted to forcibly enter the Gwadar Port Authority Colony and opened fire. Multiple blasts were also reported in the attack.\n\nAccording to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations, all eight terrorists were killed in an exchange of fire with the military while two soldiers embraced martyrdom.\n\nThe colony, where the attack took place, hosts several government and paramilitary offices. The facility is also a centrepiece of the multibillion-dollar China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\n\nMarch 26, 2024: Turbat was shaken by explosions and firing by terrorists, who, according to officials, aimed to attack PNS Siddique — which is among the biggest naval air stations in Pakistan. However, the officials said that the attack was foiled.\n\nThey added that six terrorists were killed outside the Turbat airport boundary in an operation led by a special wing of the FC and the navy’s special services group.\n\nApril 13, 2024: Nine passengers hailing from Punjab were killed near Balochistan’s Noshki when gunmen forced them off a bus. The same attackers also killed two people in another car they forced to stop.\n\nAccording to officials, 10 to 12 armed men had set up a blockade which stopped the Taftan-bound bus. They then went through the passengers’ identity cards, took nine people out — all from eastern Punjab — and fled to the mountains. The victims’ bodies were later found by the police under a bridge about 5km from the Quetta-Taftan Highway N-40.\n\nThe attack was later claimed by the BLA, according to the Associated Press.\n\nMay 10, 2024: Seven labourers hailing from Punjab were murdered in the coastal town of Sarbandan, east of Gwadar, in their sleep. The victims, who worked at local barber shops, were living in a rented residential quarter when unidentified assailants barged into the place and opened fire.\n\nFollowing the killing, the Balochistan government announced the arrest of two suspects, with the Counter Terrorism Department saying both were associated with the BLA.\n\nJune 23, 2024: Armed terrorists affiliated with the BLA kidnapped at least 14 people from a picnic spot in the Zarghoon area of Harnai district. The picnickers were abducted after they were separated from a crowd following an identity check.\n\nAs per Levies Force personnel, the terrorists had taken positions on the nearby hills. They freed four persons in the area and later abandoned their vehicle.\n\nJune 27, 2024: As many as 50 terrorists attacked a Frontier Corps (FC) check post guarding the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) oil and gas exploration site in the Kalat district of Balochistan, killing two security personnel.\n\nOfficials said the gunmen wanted to take all 20 officers deputed at the post hostage but their attempt was foiled as additional troops were quickly dispatched to the site. They added that the terrorists first attacked an FC camp in the Khaliqabad area of Kalat district and fired rockets.\n\nA spokesperson for the BLA claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nAugust 13, 2024: The deputy commissioner of Panjgur was killed in an attack on his vehicle on the Quetta-Karachi National Highway, near Mastung. DC Zakir Hussain Baloch was on his way to Quetta along with the Panjgur Municipal Committee chairman when unknown assailants opened fire.\n\nAccording to security officials, at least 15 armed men had blocked the road and were checking vehicles passing through the area. They tried to stop the deputy commissioner’s vehicle and opened fire when it sped away.\n\nThe Balochistan government said that intelligence information and evidence indicated that the BLA was behind the attack.\n\nAugust 26-27, 2024: Balochistan witnessed one of the most violent days in its turbulent history. At least 50 people, including 14 security men, lost their lives in different parts of the province as dozens of BLA terrorists affiliated went on a rampage; storming police stations, blowing up railway tracks, and setting fire to almost three dozen vehicles.\n\nThe terrorists launched numerous attacks, targeting security personnel as well as civilians, particularly those hailing from Punjab. They attacked police stations, a paramilitary camp in Bela, Levies stations, and blo­cked key roads, including the Coastal Highway. In Musakhail, a district bordering Punjab, the terrorists shot dead 23 people after checking their identity documents.\n\nSeparately, the armed forces’ media wing said 21 terrorists were neutralised by the security forces while 14 soldiers were martyred.\n\nOctober 7, 2024: Two workers from China were killed and eight wounded in a late-night bombing on a Chinese convoy outside the Karachi airport.

They set up checkpoints around the Zehri bazaar and pickets on the mountains to resist any action from security forces. The terrorists stormed the Levies station, took the personnel hostage, ransacked the records, and set the building on fire, damaging part of the structure, furniture and other items.\n\nThe armed men later attacked a private bank branch, took the staff hostage and looted over Rs90 million from the strongroom, according to bank officials.\n\nThe terrorists also attacked the offices of the Zehri municipal committee, ransacked records, and set the building on fire.
