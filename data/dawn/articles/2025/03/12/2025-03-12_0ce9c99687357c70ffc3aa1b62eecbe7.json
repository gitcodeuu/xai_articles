Under his successor, Republican Donald Trump, the EPA has sought to freeze funding related to climate change and environmental justice amid legal challenges.\n\nOver the weekend, the Climate United Fund advocacy group sued the EPA and Citigroup’s Citibank for withholding the funds and breaking what it called a legally binding contractual agreement as an awardee, saying it and seven other recipients have been unable to access the money.\n\nThe US District Court of DC will hold a hearing of this case on Wednesday.\n\nSeparately, the EPA announced in an internal memo on Tuesday that it will shutter the agency’s Office of Environmental Justice and Civil Rights, which focus on minority and low-income communities that have been hard hit by air and water pollution, along with its 10 regional offices, as part of a broader reorganisation of the agency.\n\nThe EPA had put staffers in that office on administrative leave last month.\n\n“It needlessly endangers the health of our children, particularly in areas overburdened by pollution,” said Stephanie Reese, a director at the Mom’s Clean Air Force environmental group, adding that it contradicts the EPA’s mission.",
