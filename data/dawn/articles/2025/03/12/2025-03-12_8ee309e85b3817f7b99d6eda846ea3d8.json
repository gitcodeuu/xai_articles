  "content": "An American dog owner was shot by his pet after it jumped on his bed and set off a loaded gun, police said on Wednesday.\n\nThe man, from Memphis, Tennessee, was asleep beside his female partner when he was shot early on Monday morning, escaping with a graze to his left thigh that was treated in the hospital.\n\nThe dog — a year-old pit bull named Oreo — “got his paw stuck in the trigger guard and ended up hitting the trigger”, a police incident report said. It did not specify the type of weapon fired and recorded the incident as “accidental injury”.\n\nWhile gun violence is prolific in the United States, cases of animals shooting humans are rare.\n\nTwo years ago, a German shepherd shot and killed a 30-year-old man in Kansas after it stepped on a hunting rifle. In 2018, a 51-year-old man from Iowa was shot in the leg by his pit bull-Labrador mix.\n\nLocal news station Fox 13 Memphis cited the Tennessee victim’s girlfriend, who was not named, as saying she was sleeping when the gun went off.\n\n“The dog is a playful dog, and he likes to jump around and stuff like that, and it just went off,” she reportedly said.\n\nHer lesson from the incident: “Keep the safety on or use a trigger lock. “",
