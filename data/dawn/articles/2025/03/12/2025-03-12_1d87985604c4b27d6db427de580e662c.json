He also inquired about the estimated cost of rehabilitation and whether the collected funds were used as intended.\n\nThe judge emphasised that the rehabilitation of affected areas was a local or provincial matter, raising concerns about using national funds without provincial consent. He also questioned whether taxes on services could be implemented through a money bill.\n\nJustice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned the indefinite continuation of the super tax, asking whether a tax, once imposed, could last forever.\n\nThe counsel argued that the recovery and expenditure of the super tax were never mentioned in any speeches by the finance minister and that the government should be asked to disclose how much tax had been collected and spent.\n\nHe contended that the term ‘super tax’ was used to avoid the issue of double taxation, as income tax had already been collected. He emphasised that this was not a super tax but a regular tax imposed for a specific purpose.\n\nSenior advocate Raza Rabbani, representing the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), apprised the bench that the war against terrorism was a continuous process and the rehabilitation of victims remains a critical issue.\n\nJustice Mandokhail noted that terrorism continues to affect the country on a daily basis and the victims of terrorism were displaced as a result of the operation.\n\nMakhdoom Ali questioned whether the terrorism had truly ended by 2020, as the FBR lawyer acknowledged that it remains an ongoing challenge.\n\nJustice Aminuddin Khan objected to using national general funds for provincial rehabilitation projects without provincial consent.\n\nThe counsel argued that the tax was imposed without proper transparency or accountability, and its prolonged enforcement raised questions about its legality.\n\nMilitary trials case\n\nSenior counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, representing the defence ministry, informed a seven-judge Constitutional Bench in a rebuttal that the F.B. Ali case, decided under the 1962 Constitution, had upheld the legality of military trials while also recognising the right to a fair trial within the military justice system.\n\nHe contended that the arguments presented by the opposing counsel, including Salman Akram Raja and Uzair Karamat Bhandari, were based on a misinterpretation of the case.\n\nAt this, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan observed that since the case was decided under the 1962 Constitution, it could not be directly applied to the current legal framework under the 1973 Constitution.\n\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, however, asked that if the F.B. Ali case had established that civilians were entitled to fundamental rights under Section 2(1)(d), how they could still be tried in military courts. He added that this contradiction is central to the case at hand.\n\nJustice Mandokhail, while citing Article 8(3)(a) of the Constitution — which stipulates that fundamental rights do not apply to certain laws, including those governing the armed forces — wondered whether this provision could be extended to civilians, effectively denying them fundamental rights if tried in military courts.\n\nIn response, Khawaja Haris argued that if Article 8(3)(a) were applied to civilians, they would not be entitled to fundamental rights, rendering the petition inadmissible under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.\n\nJustice Mandokhail further questioned the distinction between trials for attacks on parliament, which were tried in anti-terrorism courts, and attacks on military installations, which were tried in military courts. He wondered under what principle this distinction was made and emphasised the importance of parliamentary sovereignty, stating that for the court, the most respected institution is parliament.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 12th, 2025",
