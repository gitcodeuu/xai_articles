Last week’s hijacking of the Jaffar Express further underscored the worsening security situation.\n\nGen Munir underscored the necessity of a holistic co­unterterrorism appr­o­ach beyond military operations. “For sustainable stability, all elements of national power must work in harmony,” he said. “This is a war for our survival and that of our future generations.”\n\nThe army chief stressed that governance failures were hampering Pakis­tan’s ability to effectively counter militancy. “How long will we continue to fill governance gaps with the sacrifices of the Pakis­tan Army and the blood of martyrs?” he questioned.\n\n“We need better governance to make Pakistan a hard state,” he asserted. “How long will we continue to sacrifice countless lives under the model of a soft state?”\n\nPakistan’s counterterrorism policies have evol­ved through structured frameworks, beginning with the National Action Plan (NAP) in 2014 following the Army Public School attack. NAP was designed to combat terrorism through judicial reforms, strengthened law enforcement and measures against terror financing. The plan was revised in 2021 in response to shifting regional security dynamics after the withdrawal of coalition forces from Afghanistan and the return of the Taliban.\n\nBuilding upon NAP, Op­­eration Azm-i-Isteh­kam was launched in June 2024 under Prime Minis­ter Shehbaz Sharif’s adm­inistration amid an aggravating security situation.\n\nThe military has long maintained that while it continues to carry out kinetic operations, the civilian governments were failing in the full implementation of counterterrorism frameworks.\n\nBut neither the PCNS communique nor the army chief, whose comments were shared with the media by ISPR, mentioned the role of Afghan Taliban in sheltering TTP on Afghanistan soil, although much of the recent official narrative on the surge in terrorism has blamed the Taliban for the ongoing violence.\n\nThe PCNS underscored the importance of a unified national approach to combating terrorism. “Stressing the need for strategic and unified political resolve, the committee underscored the importance of a national consensus on counterterrorism efforts to combat this threat with the full strength of the state,” the communique stated.\n\nEchoing this sentiment, Gen Munir emphasised, “To safeguard Pakistan, we must speak with one voice, rising above political and personal interests, and adopt a unified narrative.”\n\nThe meeting was boycotted by the PTI and its allies from the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakis­tan, who were demanded permission to meet jailed founder Imran Khan. But their request was not honoured, leading to the opposition’s absence from the sitting.\n\nGen Munir took a veiled swipe at the opposition’s decision to skip the meeting. “There is no agenda greater than the security of the country — no movement, no individual,” he said. “If this country exists, then we exist. Therefore, nothing is more important to us than th e security of the country.”\n\nDespite the opposition’s boycott, the army reiterated that political forces remained committed to national security. “Those who think they can weaken Pakistan through these terrorists should take today’s message: We stand united and will not only defeat them but also their facilitators,” Gen Munir stated.\n\nThe PCNS echoed this stance, emphasising, “The committee reiterated that no institution, individual, or group colluding with enemy forces would be allowed to harm Pakistan’s peace and stability. Expressing regret over the absence of some opposition members, the committee emphasised that consultations on national security matters would continue.”\n\nThe committee also expressed concern over the growing misuse of social media by terrorist networks for propaganda, recruitment and coordination of attacks. Members called for urgent measures to counter the digital threat and stressed the need for a comprehensive framework to dismantle online terrorist operations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 19th, 2025",
