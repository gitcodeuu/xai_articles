This is a direct blow to the nation, and we will fight,” she vowed.\n\nThere was also anger on the streets.\n\n“We’re living in a dictatorship!” angrily said a shopkeeper in his 40s called Kuzey. “Whenever this guy and his dirty team see someone strong, they panic and do something illegal,” he said, referring to Erdogan and the AKP who have been in power since 2003.\n\n“In the past, it was soldiers who carried out coups. Today it’s the politicians,” sighed 63-year-old Hasan Yildiz.\n\nDespite the protest ban, 300 people rallied outside the police station where the mayor was taken in Fatih district, yelling: “Imamoglu, you are not alone!” and “Government resign!”\n\nNearby, police fired teargas to disperse some 400 students protesting outside Istanbul University over its decision late Tuesday to revoke Imamoglu’s degree, another AFP correspondent said.\n\nThe pre-dawn raid on Imamoglu’s home sparked chaos in the country’s financial markets, with the Turkish lira falling 14.5 per cent against the dollar, and the benchmark BIST 100 shedding 7.02pc.\n\nJustice Minister Yilmaz Tunc said Imamoglu was one of seven people being investigated for the “alleged crime of aiding and abetting a terrorist organisation” — a reference to the banned Kurdish PKK militant group.\n\nA second investigation, in which 100 people were being probed, involved allegations of “bribery, extortion, corruption, aggravated fraud and illegally obtaining personal data for profit as part of a criminal organisation”.\n\nMost of the 106 people cited in the probes belonged to the CHP, with critics saying it was a huge blow to the opposition.\n\n“What happened this morning was nothing short of a coup against the main opposition party, with far-reaching consequences for Turkiye’s political trajectory,” political scientist Berk Esen at Istanbul’s Sabanci University told AFP.\n\nThe move against Imamoglu drew a sharp condemnation from Berlin, with the foreign ministry saying it was a “serious setback for democracy”.\n\nSeveral European mayors signed a statement denouncing his detention, saying it “not only poses a threat to individual rights but also challenges the fabric of democratic governance in the region”.\n\nParis Mayor Anne Hidalgo said she was “shocked” to learn of the raid, saying it was “a new step in the Erdogan regime’s crackdown on opposition mayors” and demanding he be released immediately“.\n\nAthens Mayor Haris Doukas also expressed concern over the move, writing on X: “My friend Ekrem, we are by your side.”\n\nThe raid occurred just hours after Istanbul University revoked Imamoglu’s degree, amid claims it was falsely obtained. In Turkiye, presidential candidates must have a higher education qualification, with Imamoglu vowing late on Tuesday to fight the move through the courts.\n\nHis detention came just days ahead of a key meeting of the CHP party on Sunday at which Imamoglu was to have been formally named its candidate for the 2028 elections.\n\nThe 53-year-old, who was resoundingly re-elected as mayor of Turkiye’s largest city last year, has been named in several legal probes, with three new cases opened this year alone.",
