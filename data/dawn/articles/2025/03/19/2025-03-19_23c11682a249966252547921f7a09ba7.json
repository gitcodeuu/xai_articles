Eid celebrations mark the end of this period of self-restraint.\n\nEarlier this week, Pakistan Railways announced running four special trains to facilitate passengers travelling before and after Eidul Fitr.\n\nThe special train operation includes service from Quetta to Peshawar via Sibbi, Sukkur/Rohri, Khanewal, Lahore and Rawalpindi.\n\nAdditional input from Imtiaz Ali",
