The BBC director general later said that Russian media took over the BBC Arabic radio frequency in Lebanon.\n\nSarah Cook, a researcher who led the 2022 Freedom House report, said it was not as simple as China taking over from VOA, which did not enter into local contracts in the same way as Chinese media.\n\nBut a very different sort of journalism could dominate if China rather than the United States funds reporting in the developing world.\n\n“Even if Chinese state media are doing it, the content is completely different. It’s all pro-government, even pro-local government,” she said.\n\n‘Lie factory’\n\nObservers say the impact could be greatest in countries such as Cambodia and Laos, which lack the sophisticated online censorship of China. Cambodia’s longtime former leader Hun Sen wrote on Facebook to thank Trump “for his courage to lead the world to combat fake news.”\n\nIn China, the Global Times hailed the end of “lie factory” VOA, and Sputnik said VOA and RFE were behind “fakes” about Russia’s alleged massacre of civilians in Kyiv’s Bucha suburb.\n\nKari Lake, a firebrand Trump supporter brought to the US Agency for Global Media, described it as a “giant rot and burden to the American taxpayer” that is not “salvageable.”\n\nTrump often rails against media coverage of him, and his administration has called government-funded media outdated, as private news sources are readily available.\n\nBut US-funded broadcasters ran in dozens of languages and often relied on exiles with unique sourcing in their homelands.\n\nCurtis pointed to a figure that Persian-language Radio Farda reached 10 per cent of Iran’s adult population every week and to original reporting, including a 2016 RFE/RL story on a Chinese military base in Tajikistan.\n\nRadio Free Asia broadcasts in the Tibetan and Uyghur languages, a unique outlet for journalists from the minority groups to operate outside the constraints both of the Chinese government and of commercial pressure.\n\n“They are going to cover the stories that don’t get picked up by other outlets, because big media cover more broadly and don’t necessarily have as many native speakers employed,” said Mareike Ohlberg, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund who has researched Chinese media policies.\n\nOhlberg said China began a global hiring spree in media during the 2008 financial crisis as it saw the struggles of Western commercial outlets, which have long angered Beijing with critical coverage.\n\n“They saw an opportunity — let’s offer our narrative,” she said. “That expansion is going to continue, and it would have regardless of this decision. It just makes it easier for the narrative to take hold as there are now fewer alternatives.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 19th, 2025\n\nHeader image: A view of signage at the Voice of America (VOA) building, a day after more than 1,300 of the employees of the media broadcaster, which operates in almost 50 languages, were placed on leave in Washington, DC, US on March 16, 2025. — Reuters/Annabelle Gordon",
