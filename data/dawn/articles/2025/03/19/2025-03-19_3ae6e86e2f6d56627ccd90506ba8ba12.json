  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan government has decided to take strict action against Levies personnel who fail to resist terrorist attacks on their stations and check posts, showing cowardice, negligence or surrendering their weapons.\n\nThis decision comes in response to incidents in various areas of Balochistan, where Levies officials stationed at Levies stations and check posts handed over their official weapons to militants during attacks.\n\nDirector General of Balochistan Levies Force Abdul Ghaffar Magsi has issued a circular for the personnel, announcing strict action against those who exhibit negligence or cowardice instead of defending themselves during terrorist attacks.\n\nIn the circular, the DG Levies stated that any personnel showing negligence or cowardice during attacks or surrendering weapons to militants will be immediately dismissed from service.\n\nApplications for reemployment from such personnel will not be accepted under any circumstances.\n\nMr Magsi instructed all Levies personnel to respond swiftly and bravely to terrorist attacks, stressing that the force must take all necessary measures against terrorists and perform their duties with integrity and courage to safeguard the public.\n\nHe said the Balochistan Levies Force will fully utilise its capabilities to ensure public safety and intensify actions against terrorists.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 19th, 2025",
