It later became evident these plants were being run on imported oil and coal, making electricity production exorbitantly expensive.\n\nIn a statement, he said billions of dollars were spent, yet when electricity demand decreased, the government paid “capacity charges,” skyrocketing circular debt due to poor planning.\n\nHe said that the government initially promoted solar energy by introducing on-grid systems, encouraging the public to install solar panels with the assurance that the government would purchase surplus electricity.\n\nHowever, this policy was now being altered, and instead of purchasing electricity at Rs27 per\n\nunit, the government plans to reduce the rate to Rs10 per unit.\n\nHe said that this shift was prompting people to move towards off-grid systems, which would further increase capacity charges and inflict more economic damage. He demanded that the government formulate a comprehensive and long-term energy policy to prevent further financial damage caused by frequent policy changes.\n\nHe maintained that the country could no longer afford ill-planned decision-making that brings industries and businesses on the brink of closure.\n\nHe added that there must be an immediate review and annulment of exploitative contracts with IPPs to curb growing circular debt and stabilise electricity prices.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 19th, 2025",
