  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The protest organised by the people affected by the Diamer-Bhasha dam continued on Sunday despite a meeting between a federal committee — formed by the prime minister — and the protesters in Chilas to break the deadlock.\n\nThe 20-day-long protest in Chilas is seeking the implementation of a 31-point charter of demands, which pertain to their rehabilitation, and the allotment of agricultural land, among other things.\n\nIn his meeting with the protesters, Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs Amir Muqam said that the government has included the rehabilitation of the affected people of Bhasha and Dasu dams, and the development of the area in its top priorities. He assured that their demands concerning a financial package for the affected households, a resettlement programme, health, education, and infrastructure would be resolved on a priority basis. He also promised a ‘Danish School’ for the area.\n\nThe minister directed Wapda officials to ensure payment of land compensation along with the construction of 23 schools.\n\nProtesters tell federal committee to implement doable demands at once, seek assurances for the rest\n\nEarlier, the dam-affected people presented their problems to the special committee. The committee issued instructions to the technical committee to prepare recommendations and send them to the federal government.\n\nIn the meeting, Hazratullah, a representative of the protesters, presented their charter of demands and said the protesters were not asking to implement all of their demands at once, but the government could express its seriousness by enforcing basic demands, such as a financial package for the households that had not received any.\n\n“If you are serious about solving the demands, you can solve some demands, for example, the financial package for the missing households, six kanal agricultural land each for the affected people, CBM schemes, including health, education, development, and resettlement of affectees,” he added.\n\nHe suggested that the committee could promptly announce the measures it can in the meeting and for the remainder, it could provide a written assurance that these would be fulfilled as well.\n\n“…[S]o that we can tell people that your demands have been solved and will call off” the sit-in, Hazratullah said, adding that the people who were protesting had “sacrificed everything for the dam” and justice should be ensured. Diamer people are peaceful, but that does not mean everything should be imposed on them, he warned. Sources said after the meeting, the organisers did not decide to call off the protest.\n\nHowever, Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, GB ministers Rehmat Khaliq and Shah Baig continued negotiations with the protesters to convince them to end the protest. However, there was no further word until going to press.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 10th, 2025",
