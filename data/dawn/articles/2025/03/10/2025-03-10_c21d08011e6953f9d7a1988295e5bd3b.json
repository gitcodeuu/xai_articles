  "content": "LAHORE: Newly appointed Federal Minister for Pakistan Railways (PR) Muhammad Hanif Abbasi says he will soon order a prob into the recent auctions of the railway properties in Badami Bagh (Lahore), including “misplacement” of the original auction file, and allegedly making a duplicate file, besides the decision to re-auction the assets.\n\nIn a telephonic conversion with Dawn, he said he wouldn’t tolerate any wrongdoing in the railways, pledging to make the department the best in service delivery and a profit-earning organisation.\n\n“I will reach the PR’s headquarters on Monday (Today) and hold the first meeting with the senior officials in a bid to know about the department’s operations, revenue and other issues,” Mr Abbasi said. “And I will also question the officers about the issues pointed out regarding the recent auctions, the reasons for the decision to hold auctions again. I will definitely take action\n\nif any wrongdoing has been committed in this regard,“ he pledged.\n\nThe new minister intends to hold officials concerned accountable\n\nMr Abbasi thanked the Shehbaz Sharif-led PML-N government for appointing him railways minister and said he would work hard to resolve the issues the department has been facing.\n\nThe PR’s Lahore Division has recently decided to go for re-auctioning its properties in Badami Bagh that triggered a controversy. According to sources, the process is being manipulated to favour certain bidders.\n\nThe properties, mainly warehouses, were auctioned recently, but the process was cancelled after the original auction file mysteriously disappeared. The sources alleged that the cancellation of the auction was aimed at facilitating some bidders who were unable to secure properties in the initial auction.\n\nHowever, PR’s Divisional Superintendent (DS) Hanif Gull dismisses these claims, claiming that the re-auction is intended to ensure fairness and transparency.\n\nNIGHEBAN PACKAGE: Lahore City District Administration on Sunday got arrested five agents for illegally charging amounts from the beneficiaries of the government’s Nigheban Ramzan Package.\n\nTwo agents were apprehended from Ravi Town for charging Rs500 from each beneficiary. Cases were registered against the both suspects.\n\nSimilarly, in Shalimar Town, three Omni dealers were arrested and\n\nFIRs were lodged against them for receiving illegal amounts from the beneficiaries.\n\n“We are committed to ensure that the cheques reach the rightful beneficiaries without any exploitation,” stated DC Syed Musa Raza, emphasising that transparency in the Nigahban Ramzan Programme remains the administration’s top priority as the cheques were being delivered door-to-door throughout Lahore.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 10th, 2025",
