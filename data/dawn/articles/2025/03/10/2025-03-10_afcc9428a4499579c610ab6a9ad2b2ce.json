  "content": "The number of Shisham trees in the Potohar region has witnessed a significant decline due to multiple fungal diseases, such as ‘dieback’ (a fungal disease affecting roots), which are causing the ‘widespread death’ of this species across the region.\n\nIn the 1960s, these trees were planted along the highways and railway tracks across the country and had been providing shade and much-needed fuel. The forest department had taken extraordinary care to safeguard these trees since their wood is highly valuable for furniture and other household items made of wood. However, the plant seems to be dying fast.\n\nJunaid Khan, the district forest officer (DFO) in Rawalpindi, claimed that drought and water scarcity were causing widespread tree ‘die-back’ that has a drastic effect on the composition, function, and other agents of the ecosystem, making forest sustainability a significant concern amid changing climate.\n\nHe said that climate change was resulting in the intensity of climatic anomalies, such as drought and flooding, and tree mortality associated with intense droughts was becoming “more prevalent”.\n\nFungal diseases causing the rout of tree species in region\n\nSyed Iftikhar Bokhari, agriculture director based in Rawalpindi, said dieback can be cured at early stages if the roots of the affected trees are treated with fungicides. He, however, said that the disease was new to the subcontinent as it faced “a similar set of diseases and insects for crops and plants”.\n\nThe chief conservator of forests, who is based in Lahore, agreed that dieback was the major cause of death of this species. The officer also suggested that the fungal attacks on the roots and stems of the trees were also causing the swift death of such trees.\n\nAccording to the expert, the shisham trees offer important raw material for a wide range of wood-based industries. He said this plant is also preferred for heating and cooking due to its high calorific value, but it’s tragic to see this valuable plant ‘drying to death’. He said that curbing climatic change was the focus of the Punjab government, and the forest department was doing its best to promote tree plantation in this regard. The officer suggested that the best way to combat climate change was “to plant more and more plants to transform the environment”.\n\nWhen asked what species of plant can compensate for the losses being caused by dieback and fungal diseases, he said, “Ehreria acuminata was cultivated in the Changa Manga forests.”\n\nAccording to the officer, this variety has good-quality wood, a comparatively fast growth rate, is disease-free, and has a good survival rate in all plain areas. Gmelina arborea (gulcan) is also best in wood quality and survival chances, the officer added. Though there is no data about the trees affected by the disease, a senior officer of the Punjab Forest Dept remarked that it “may be in millions as a young crop of 5-10 years was also found affected”.\n\nOn the other hand, the furniture manufacturers also expressed concerns over the ‘die-back’ impact on Shisham. Muhammad Aftab, a third-generation carpenter based in Gujar Khan, said that the shisham wood was the backbone of the furniture industry. He said that there were several grades of this wood ranging from raw to ripe, adding that the raw wood is white or pale while the ripe wood is of golden hue, while the black wood is the much preferred. He further told that these plants, like pines, are also categorised into male and female sexes, and the latter is the most valued due to its durability and shine.\n\nThe experienced carpenter rued that now the synthetic sheets serve as replicas and replacements with attractive patterns, but these are not as durable as the original dark black wood. He also revealed his business secret that Keekar wood was also being used in place of Shisham.\n\nMuhammad Kamran Malik, another carpenter in Gujar Khan, said that the non-availability of quality wood had pushed prices of furniture too high. The price of a bed and sofas made with pure quality wood ranges from Rs1 lac to Rs3 lac.\n\nSyed Rashid Shah, a retired agriculture official, said that the shisham tree was the most preferred for soil conservation due to its “rapid growth and root netting” in the soil. He said the seeds as well as the roots of this tree grow into new plants around the parent trees, eventually turning into thick groves. However, its shortened life span is unfortunate, and it is affecting the environment as well as the furniture industry, he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 10th, 2025",
