  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain has directed the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation (Passco) to expedite the sale of wheat stocks before the arrival of the new harvest, ensuring market stability and preventing financial losses.\n\nChairing a high-level meeting at Passco headquarters in Lahore on Saturday, the minister stressed the importance of timely wheat disposal to maintain national food security and avoid potential storage-related losses.\n\nThe minister was briefed about the current wheat stock position and was informed that as of March 6, Passco had 2.47 million tonnes of wheat in stock after disposing of 578,934 tonnes from April 1, 2024, to March 6, 2025. Besides, Passco procured 1.79 tonnes during the 2024 wheat crop season.\n\nPassco officials insisted that the organisation is fulfilling its responsibilities of maintaining national food security and stabilising the market. Various measures have been implemented to ensure transparency in the wheat sale process, benefiting both farmers and consumers.\n\nPassco officials briefed the federal minister on various organisational matters and progress related to wheat sales. They informed him that Passco has strengthened coordination with different agencies and provincial authorities to accelerate the sale of wheat. Several key measures are being taken to ensure timely transactions.\n\nMr Tanveer emphasised there would be zero tolerance for any delays in the wheat sale process, as prolonged storage could impact the quality of wheat and lead to financial losses.\n\nHe reaffirmed the government’s commitment to agricultural development, food security and farmer welfare.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 10th, 2025",
