Carney may not have the job for long.\n\nCanada must hold elections by October but could well see a snap poll within weeks. Current polls put the opposition Conservatives as slight favorites.\n\nIn his victory speech to a boisterous crowd of party supporters in Ottawa, Carney warned the US under Trump was seeking to seize control of Canada.\n\n“The Americans want our resources, our water, our land, our country,” he said.\n\n“These are dark days, dark days brought on by a country we can no longer trust.” Carney, who previously led both the Bank of Canada and the Bank of England, soundly defeated his main challenger, Trudeau’s former deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who held several senior cabinet positions in the Liberal government that was first elected in 2015.\n\nCarney won 85.9 per cent of the nearly 152,000 votes cast. Freeland took just eight per cent of the vote.\n\nCarney campaigned on a promise to stand up to Trump.\n\nThe US president has repeatedly spoken about annexing Canada and thrown bilateral trade, the lifeblood of the Canadian economy, into chaos with dizzying tariff actions that have veered in various directions since he took office.\n\nDelivering a farewell address before the results were announced, Trudeau said, “Canadians face from our neighbor, an existential challenge.”\n\nCelebrating the outcome in Ottawa, party loyalist Cory Stevenson said “the Liberal party has the wind in its sails.” “We chose the person who could best face off against (Tory leader) Pierre Poilievre in the next election and deal with Donald Trump,” he told AFP.\n\nCarney has argued that his experience makes him the ideal counter to the US president, portraying himself as a seasoned economic crisis manager who led the Bank of Canada through the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the Bank of England through the turbulence that followed the 2016 Brexit vote.\n\nData released from the Angus Reid polling firm on Wednesday shows Canadians see Carney as the favourite choice to face off against Trump, potentially offering the Liberals a boost over the opposition Conservatives.\n\nForty-three per cent of respondents said they trusted Carney the most to deal with Trump, with 34 per cent backing Poilievre.\n\nBefore Trudeau announced his plans to resign in January, the Liberals were headed for an electoral wipeout, but the leadership change and Trump’s influence have dramatically tightened the race.\n\n“I think we were written off about four months ago, and now we’re right back where we should be,” former MP Frank Baylis, who also ran for the leadership, told AFP in Ottawa.\n\nCarney made a fortune as an investment banker at Goldman Sachs before entering the Canadian civil service.\n\nSince leaving the Bank of England in 2020, he has served as a UN envoy working to get the private sector to invest in climate-friendly technology and has held private sector roles.\n\nHe has never served in parliament nor held an elected public office. Analysts say his untested campaign skills could prove a liability against a Conservative Party already running attack ads accusing Carney of shifting positions and misrepresenting his experience.\n\n“It is absolutely a risk. He is unproven in the crucible of an election,” said Cameron Anderson, a political scientist at Ontario’s Western University.\n\nHe said Carney’s victory speech, and its tough anti-Trump rhetoric, “is what Canadians want to hear from their leaders.” “The average Canadian in the country is viewing these things in an existential way,” Anderson said.",
