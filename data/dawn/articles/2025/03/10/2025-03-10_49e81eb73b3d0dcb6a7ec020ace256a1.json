Reigning T20 world champions India beat New Zealand in Sunday’s final to prove their credentials as a white-ball behemoth.\n\nIndia have lost just one match — the final of the ODI World Cup in 2023 — in their last three ICC events and probably did not require what many called an “unfair advantage” of playing all their matches in Dubai.\n\n“I feel sorry for India’s cricketers,” award-winning cricket writer Nicholas Brookes told Reuters. “They are an outstanding team in my mind, streets ahead of their competition regardless of conditions, and one of the greatest white-ball sides the game has seen.\n\n“This tournament should have been their victory lap, but their brilliance has been somewhat overshadowed by constant questions about unfair advantages.”\n\nAllowing India to play all their matches in Dubai robbed Pakistan of the honour of hosting the final and disrupted the schedule of the knockout matches. South Africa were made to take a farcical 18-hour trip to Dubai in anticipation of a semi-final against India before flying back to Pakistan to face New Zealand.\n\nThe whole affair made the ICC, currently headed by former Board of Control for Cricket in India secretary Jay Shah, look weak in front of the world’s richest cricket board. The scheduling also favoured India, who had a week’s rest between their last two group matches, while Afghanistan played twice in three days.\n\n“That looks like the ICC putting finances ahead of fairness,” said Brookes, whose An Island’s Eleven charts the history of Sri Lankan cricket and won the Wisden Book Of The Year award in 2023. “Some people will naturally think that the governing body is bending over backwards to accommodate India.”\n\nDefending champions Pakistan looked under-prepared for the tournament, both on and off the field. An eleventh-hour facelift to stadiums in Karachi and Lahore, sparse crowds and three washouts dampened the spirit among locals.\n\nAdding to their woes, Mohammed Rizwan and his men finished bottom of Group A after a winless campaign that included a defeat by arch-rivals India.\n\nAn injury-ravaged Australia fielded a second-string pace attack with Steve Smith, who quit ODIs after their semi-final exit, leading them in the absence of regular skipper Pat Cummins.\n\nNew Zealand all-rounder Rachin Ravindra bagged the player-of-the-tournament prize, while fellow Black Cap Glenn Phillips redefined fielding with gravity-defying catches, and India’s Virat Kohli proved he is not a spent force yet, but the cricket was largely mediocre.\n\nAfghanistan could not make the last four but impressed on their Champions Trophy debut while former champions England are searching for a new captain after their winless campaign prompted Jos Buttler to step down.\n\nHeader image: A person rides on a motorbike past a wall with a billboard advertisement ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 tournament, in Karachi on Feb 13. — Reuters",
