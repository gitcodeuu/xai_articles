  "content": "THE reference to “fascist” appears prominently in the Preamble proposed by the Constitution Reform Commission. I shall argue that there are good reasons for avoiding that reference.\n\nThe very first paragraph of the proposed Preamble asserts that “(we have) forged united resistance against autocratic and fascist rule in order to establish democracy.” The second paragraph goes on to proclaim “the ideals of democracy and anti-discrimination that united (us) against fascist rule in 2024.”\n\nIt is obvious that, without naming names, the Preamble is referring to the “July uprising” against Sheikh Hasina’s autocratic regime. The student leaders who valiantly led that mass uprising made frequent use of the words “fascism” and “fascist” while describing the regime they were fighting against, and not surprisingly, these words soon came to permeate the entire popular discourse on the uprising. Evidently, in trying to reflect the spirit of “July uprising,” the proposed Preamble also captured the most ubiquitous vocabulary that came into currency along with that spirit.\n\nIt is nonetheless a mistake for the Preamble to use that vocabulary. Two kinds of error are involved here—one conceptual and the other political. The conceptual error is that, strictly speaking, the term fascism is not a correct description of the oppression meted out by the last regime. And the political error is that by describing Hasina’s regime as fascist, we are unwittingly granting it a somewhat elevated status it does not deserve. The latter error is more important for practical reasons, since, as I am going to argue, it amounts to watering down the ugliness and barbarity of the Hasina regime.\n\nFascist rulers engaged in ‘militarism’ and ‘expansionism’ while the Awami League leader survived through cronyism\n\nBut let me begin with the conceptual error, from which the political error follows as a logical corollary. The root of the problem lies in an inadequate appreciation of what the idea of “fascism” actually stands for. Like most other “isms” such as communism, nationalism, liberalism, conservatism, etc, fascism is essentially a political ideology that has a distinct ideal—a conception about the kind of society worth striving for.\n\nThe core of this ideal is the conviction that the objective of politics (in the broadest sense) should be to serve the interest of the “collective entity” of the state or the nation, as opposed to the interest of the “individual persons” who constitute the state. In other words, it is the “greatness” of the collectivity called state, rather than the “well-being” and “freedom” of individual persons, that is the supreme goal of all activities of a fascist regime.\n\nThis ideology leads inevitably to a number of pernicious consequences that have historically been responsible for giving fascism the bad name it has, rightly, acquired. First, in search of “greatness” of the state, fascist rulers have tended to engage in “militarism” and “expansionism,” leading to disastrous military conflicts in Europe in the 20th century.\n\nSecond, since individual persons are supposed to exist only to serve the interest of the collective called state, fascist rulers have found it fit to ruthlessly suppress all kinds of individual freedoms, such as freedom of speech, freedom to dissent, etc, so as to prevent anything that could be even remotely deemed to be subversive of the state.\n\nThe same ideology also paves the way for rule by a “great” dictator, who is supposed to be a human embodiment of the “collective,” and who usurps the responsibility of pursuing the greatness of the state, at whatever cost of the well-being and freedoms of individuals.\n\nOn the economic front, the faith in the supremacy of the collective tends to create a highly regimented and state-controlled economic system, where private initiatives are viewed with deep suspicion. A fascist regime is thus characterised by the following features: inherently militaristic in its outward orientation, unashamedly authoritarian in its political system, and strictly regimented in its economic institutions.\n\nIt is now easy to see why the term fascism does not correctly describe Sheikh Hasina’s regime. For one thing, her regime was not militaristic in its outward orientation. Secondly, the economic system was far from being state-controlled and inimical to private entrepreneurship. On the contrary, it was an utterly rotten case of crony capitalism in which Hasina’s cronies were given a free hand to loot public resources for private gain. Apparently, then, the only similarity with fascism was the authoritarian political system, but there is a fundamental difference here, which is the main focus of my argument.\n\nAs noted above, the authoritarianism of a fascist regime stems from a political ideology that eulogises the collective over the individual. In contrast, one can argue that Hasina did not have any ideology at all. It was her megalomania and an unquenchable thirst for personal power, rather than the interest of the “collective state,” that motivated her brutality.\n\nThe gist of the matter is that while all fascist regimes are authoritarian, not all authoritarian regimes are fascist. An authoritarian regime can be called fascist only when it is driven by the political ideology of the supremacy of the collective over the individual. Hasina was not driven by any such ideology; hence, it’s a mistake to use the term fascism to describe her regime.\n\nThis story was originally published on Daily Star, an ANN partner of Dawn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 10th, 2025",
