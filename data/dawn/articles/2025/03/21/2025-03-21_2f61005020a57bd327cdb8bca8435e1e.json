The police team was pursuing two notorious drug smugglers — Sharif Khan alias Sharifay and Ahmadzeb — following a tip-off regarding their activities.\n\nMoin Ali, spokesperson for Swat District Police Officer (DPO) Nasir Mehmood, said the police today launched an intelligence-based operation in the mountainous region of Fizagat against a criminal involved in SHO Rahim’s murder.\n\nThe suspects “opened indiscriminate fire, killing Constable Niaz Muhammad as well as injuring Additional Sub-Inspector (ASI) Amjad Iqbal, Constable Muhammad Hussain and Constable Sarfaraz”, Ali added.\n\nHe further confirmed that in the ensuing exchange of fire, wanted drug smuggler Ahmadzeb — a prime suspect in SHO Rahim’s killing — was shot and killed.\n\n“Acting on a tip-off, police reached the suspect’s residence to conduct a search and arrest operation,” the DPO’s spokesperson stated, adding that additional police units were deployed to the scene and immediately surrounded the house.\n\nThe injured officers were swiftly transported to Saidu Sharif Hospital, where doctors confirmed that their condition was stable. A large police contingent secured the area and launched further investigations into the incident, Ali added.\n\nThe police operation continued for four hours, Mingora SHO Mujeeb Alam told Dawn.com.\n\nSHO Alam further said police checked the rooms of the four-storey building and collected evidence.\n\nLast week, a huge quantity of drugs was recovered during a raid on the house of a former policeman in Faisalabad.\n\nEarlier this month, a court in Peshawar convicted two officials of the excise police for smuggling narcotics and sentenced them to life imprisonment with a fine of Rs1 million each.\n\nIn January, the excise, taxation and narcotics control department personnel in KP’s Dera Ismail Khan had seized four kilogrammes of crystal meth (ice) from a car and arrested the suspect.",
