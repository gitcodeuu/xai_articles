  "content": "PESHAWAR: Fraudsters have been found using a forged sponsor letter from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa director general of sports in order to secure New Zealand’s visas for seven people posing as squash players and support staff.\n\nThe issue came to light after the New Zealand consulate general took it up with the Pakistan Squash Federation, which formally reported it to the sports department, according to official sources.\n\nDetails available with Dawn show that on Feb 7, a sponsorship letter on the letterhead of the KP directorate general of sports was sent to the New Zealand consulate general.\n\nThe letter said that five players and two officials were selected to take part in the New Zealand Open Junior Squash Championship, 2025, scheduled to be held on March 7-9 in Christchurch.\n\nOfficial says FIA looking into the matter\n\nIt added that the junior squash team would be led by team coach Kaleemullah and manager Mohammad Bilal.\n\nThe letter said that Bilal had already accompanied squash contingents to the UK, US and many other countries.\n\nIt added that the DG (sports) would be covering all expenses of all the team during the New Zealand visit.\n\nThe letter said that both the manager and coach were permanent employees of the directorate general of sports.\n\nIt added that manager Mohammad Bilal would further travel to Australia for squash events for which he held a valid visa.\n\n“We take all responsibilities of the above-mentioned professionals after the completion of the squash event. They will leave New Zealand and come back to their home country to start preparing for upcoming tournaments in the United States,” it said, seeking a New Zealand visa for them to enable them to participate in the squash tournament.\n\nOn Feb 24, a staff member of the New Zealand consulate general for Pakistan sent an email to the Pakistan Squash Federation for the verification of the credibility of those players and officials.\n\n“Attached is a recommendation letter from the office of the DG (sports) pertaining to a group of squash players and officials who are going to participate in an event in New Zealand and they have applied for the visas of New Zealand and submitted it as a supporting document,” the email read.\n\nThe consulate general asked the federation to verify the details of the events, the credibility of the players and accompanying staff, and the sponsorship of the event by the DG (sports).\n\n“Kindly revert to us as soon as possible because the players and supporting staff are supposed to arrive in New Zealand by March 3,” it said.\n\nA source told Dawn that when the PSF took up the matter with the DG (sports), it turned out that the official whose signature appeared on the sponsorship letter was posted out of his position as the director general in November 2023 and the letter was forged. The fraudsters were later denied visas, according to him.\n\nOn the other hand, former DG (sports) Khalid Mehmood, who is currently serving as the chairman of the Higher Education Regulatory Authority and whose signature was found on the sponsorship letter, formally requested the sports and youth affairs secretary on March 8 to get the matter probed through the Provincial Inspection Team or anti-corruption establishment.\n\nMr Mehmood’s letter, a copy of which is available with Dawn, stated that he received the sponsorship letter along with an email of New Zealand consulate general through the social media, which bore the fake or scanned signature of the undersigned.\n\n“The undersigned was not the director general (sports) after November 2023. Whether the contents of the correspondence in questions are correct or fake or someone has made a joke, in either case, the undersigned has serious concerns with such signature affixed upon the letter and [it] needs to be probed. A process on the letter in question, if any, may be stopped,” the letter said.\n\nA source told Dawn that in the past, people managed to enter the UK, US, England and France through such forged letters.\n\nHe added that after the matter came to light, PSF wrote to all embassies and counterpart squash organisations to verify all such requests.\n\nAnother official said that under the KP Rules of Business, 1985, all correspondence with the Government of a foreign country or a Pakistan’s diplomatic mission abroad or a foreign mission in Pakistan or international organisation, shall normally be conducted through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nIn Dec last year, Squash Australia formally approached the PSF after receiving a letter from a player requesting a letter of invite for the Australian Junior Open in April 11-17, 2024, in individual capacity.\n\n“We normally receive a list of players from your federation to confirm their endorsement, so we were just reaching out to confirm if his coach will be endorsed,” read the Squash Australia’s email.\n\nThe PSF later wrote to the KP Squash Association, saying it has been brought to its notice that squash player Mohammad Fawad Khan from KP forwarded his entry, without PSF endorsement, for participation in Australian Junior Open.\n\n“Moreover the player has also forwarded a fake visa letter for acquiring his Australian visa. KPSA is requested to investigate the case and forward comments/outcome for further disciplinary action by PSF,” the letter read.\n\nWhen contacted, DG (sports) Abdul Nasir said the sponsorship letter was fake and even the email shared on the letter was also fake. He said that the Federal Investigation Agency was probing the matter.\n\nSports and Youth Affairs Secretary Ziaul Haq didn’t respond to this correspondent’s phone calls and text messages.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 21st, 2025",
