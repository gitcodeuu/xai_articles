  "content": "Opener Hasan Nawaz struck a record-breaking maiden century on Friday as Pakistan thrashed New Zealand by nine wickets in the third Twenty20 to keep the series alive.\n\nAfter scoring a duck in each of the two opening games — the first innings’ of his international career — Nawaz rebounded with a stunning 105 not out in Auckland as the tourists raced to 207-1 in just 16 overs in response to New Zealand’s 204.\n\nThe 23-year-old’s ton came off 44 balls, the fastest by any Pakistan player in a T20 international.\n\nIt ensured his team reached the target with four full overs to spare, in a stark reversal of form after heavy losses in Christchurch and Dunedin.\n\nNawaz put his early failures behind him with a sparkling knock featuring shots all around the wicket, including a series of audacious ramp shots.\n\nThe right-hander peppered the short Eden Park boundaries with 10 fours and seven sixes, bringing up victory with successive fours off Kyle Jamieson in the 16th over.\n\nThe first of those shots took Nawaz to 100, five balls faster than the previous Pakistan record-holder — Babar Azam against South Africa in 2021.\n\nFellow opener Mohammad Haris scored 41 off 20 while captain Salman Agha was unbeaten on 51 off 31.\n\nEarlier, New Zealand looked well placed after Mark Chapman hit a rapid 94 before they were dismissed in their final over.\n\nChapman dominated after New Zealand were asked to bat, tallying 11 fours and four sixes from just 44 balls faced.\n\nThe rest of the home side’s batsmen struggled to get going, aside from captain Michael Bracewell’s 31.\n\nExperienced seamer Haris Rauf bowled Bracewell and finished with Pakistan’s best figures of 3-29.\n\nGame four of the five-match series is in Mount Maunganui on Sunday.",
