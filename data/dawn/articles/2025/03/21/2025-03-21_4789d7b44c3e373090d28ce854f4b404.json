  "content": "DOHA: The Taliban on Thursday freed an American citizen detained in Afghanistan for over two years following direct talks between US hostage envoy Adam Boehler and Taliban officials in Kabul, a source briefed on the release said.\n\nGeorge Glezmann, a mechanic for Delta Airlines in Atlanta, was detained in 2022 while visiting Kabul as a tourist, left Afghanistan aboard a Qatari aircraft on Thursday evening bound for Qatar, the source said. Glezmann and Boehler are expected to later travel onward to the United States.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement on Thursday confirming Glezmann’s release. Thursday’s meeting in Kabul marked the highest-level direct talks between the United States and the Taliban since President Donald Trump came to power in January.\n\nBoehler met with the Taliban administration’s foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, according to a statement by the Afghan foreign ministry. “During this meeting, discussions were held on Afghanistan-US bilateral relations, the release of prisoners, and the provision of consular services to Afghans in the United States,” the statement said.\n\nUS envoy Boehler, former special representative to Afghanistan Khalilzad hold talks in Kabul\n\nIt added that the meeting was also attended by former US special representative to Afghanistan Zalmay Khalilzad. Qatar, a Gulf Arab state which represents US diplomatic interests in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan, said in a statement posted on X that it had facilitated Glezmann’s release.\n\nThe source said that Qatar coordinated with Boehler to negotiate with the Taliban authorities. “Following weeks of negotiations, a breakthrough was made by the Qataris during recent meetings with the Taliban,” the source said.\n\nTaliban ‘goodwill gesture’\n\nIn a statement, the Taliban called Glezmann’s release a “goodwill gesture” reflecting its willingness to engage with the United States “on the basis of mutual respect and interests.”\n\nThe source said that the release was not part of a deal to free any Afghan detainees held by the US in exchange. The US in January freed an Afghan convicted by an American court on charges of drug smuggling and terrorism in exchange for two US citizens held in Afghanistan.\n\nQatari officials were also involved in negotiations for that deal, which began during the administration of former US president Joe Biden and led to the release of two Americans, Ryan Corbett and William McKenty. A third American citizen, Mahmood Habibi, is thought to remain in custody in Afghanistan.\n\nBoehler’s high level diplomacy\n\nGlezmann was the second high-profile release of a US citizen held overseas secured amid diplomacy by Boehler. Boehler was involved in efforts that led to the release of American school teacher Marc Fogel from Russia last month.\n\nIn addition, Boehler has held direct talks with Palestinian group Hamas in an effort to secure the release of remaining prisoners held in Gaza. He also travelled to Iraq last month to push for the release of Israeli-Russian researcher Elizabeth Tsurkov, a student at Princeton University.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 21st, 2025",
