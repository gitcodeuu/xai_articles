  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Volleyball Federation will host two international events including an eight-nation Central Asian League and an U-19 series against Russia, besides holding the national championship this year, PVF chairman Chaudhry Mohammad Yaqoob said on Thursday.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Yaqoob said that India was the first country, which had sent the entry for the league, followed by other countries including Iran, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and Sri Lanka.\n\n“We hope that all the countries will visit Pakistan to participate in this tournament, which will also help improve the Asian ranking of these countries,” Yaqoob said.\n\nThe league will be held in Islamabad from May 28 to June 4 while a five-match U-19 series against Russia will also be staged in the capital from June 23 to 30.\n\nThis series is being organised to give maximum preparation opportunity to Pakistan’s junior team, which had qualified for the World Cham­pionship being held in Uzbekistan from July 21 to Aug 3 this year.\n\nEarlier, the 54th National Volleyball Championship will be staged at Wah Cantt from April 4 to 10.\n\nLast year, Yaqoob recalled, the PVF had also organised three international events, including a series against Australia, which Pakistan won 3-0. Moreover, the senior team finished as runners-up in the AVC Challenge Cup held in Bahrain while winning the gold medal in the six-nation Central Asian Volleyball League which was staged in Islamabad.\n\n“We need more support from the government as well as private sponsors to lift the momentum as our players have enough talent, which is reflected through the recent successes [achieved by Pakistan] in international contests,” the PVF chairman said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 21st, 2025",
