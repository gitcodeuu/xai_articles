  "content": "KARACHI: The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) rose $49 million to $11.146bn during the week ended on March 14.\n\nWithout disclosing the source of this inflow, the central bank announced on Thursday that the country’s overall reserves reached $16.015bn, including $4.869bn held by the commercial banks.\n\nThe SBP reserves increased from $9.436bn in August 2024 to $12.037bn in November. However, since then, they have been falling, making it difficult for the SBP to reach the $13bn target set for FY25.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 21st, 2025",
