  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) on Saturday denounced the government’s persistent defiance of the Senate chairman’s production order for incarcerated PTI Senator Ejaz Chaudhry.\n\nPTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram said the “contemptuous behaviour” exhibited by the government towards the production order issued by the Senate chairman for the PTI senator further undermined Pa­­kistan’s parliamentary system but also brought disrepute to the esteemed office of the Senate chairman across the world.\n\nHe expressed satisfaction that detai­ned PTI Senator Aon Abbas Bappi was presented in parliament but criticised the PML-N government for its continued refusal to produce Senator Ejaz Chaud­hry. He said that the continued defiance of legal and parliamentary authority was unacceptable and condemnable.\n\nHe demanded that the Senate chairman issue a strong ruling against this blatant disregard for his clear orders and hold accountable the violators, because it not only undermined parliamentary authority but also an insult to the office of the chairman.\n\nSheikh Waqqas says defiance of Senate chairman’s order undermines parliamentary system\n\nHe warned that such actions would have far-reaching negative consequences on the supremacy of parliament and democratic system, setting a dangerous precedent where executive authorities feel emboldened to disregard legislative rulings at will.\n\nPerpetual use of oppression\n\nRegarding the detention of Senator Bappi from his home, Sheikh Waqqas said the government must realise the gravity of the situation.\n\nHe emphasised that the perpetual use of oppression and suppression would not yield any positive results for the government, rather further undermine the rule of law and exacerbate the real challenges faced by the nation.\n\nHe suggested that the government revisit its approach and refrain from jeopardising the country’s future for the sake of prolonging its rule. He said that expanding the federal cabinet to accommodate turncoats and deserters and squandering public money on self-projections would do nothing to heal the wounds of the nation. Such measures would serve only to deepen the frustration and resentment of the people, who were suffering under the weight of economic crisis, political instability and a deteriorating security situation, he added.\n\nGlobal terrorism index\n\nThe PTI leader expressed grave concern over Pakistan’s alarming decline in the global terrorism index and blasted the rulers for their apathy and indifference to the critical issue.\n\nHe rebuked the statements made by Rana Sanaullah regarding the inclusion of Pervez Khattak in the cabinet.\n\nJust a day ago, Mr Sanaullah had distanced his party from Mr Khattak’s inclusion, yet he stated Mr Khattak could effectively handle the PTI, Sheikh Waqqas regretted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025",
