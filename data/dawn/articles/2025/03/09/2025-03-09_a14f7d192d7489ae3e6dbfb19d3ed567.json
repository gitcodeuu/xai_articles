It (his murder) is the greatest atrocity.”\n\nA separate social media post on Sunday said that funeral prayers had been offered for Shakeel in the same village.\n\nMeanwhile, Swabi District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Azhar told Dawn.com that the incident was “not an act of terrorism” and that two people were killed and one was wounded in the shooting.\n\nAccording to the DPO, the incident began in Shakeel’s neighbour’s house, where his neighbour and his son had a dispute that turned violent. “The suspect allegedly shot his father, upon which Shakeel went outside the house and tried to intervene, but he was also shot”, he told Dawn.com.\n\n“The suspect’s father and Shakeel were killed in the incident, while another person was injured and rushed to Kalu Khan Hospital,” Azhar added.\n\nA first information report was registered with Kalu Khan police station — a copy of which is available with Dawn.com — filed by Riaz Ahmad, another sibling of the former senator’s.\n\nThe FIR was registered under Sections 302 (punishment for murder) and 324 (punishment for attempted murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n\nThe DPO said that police are investigating the incident.",
