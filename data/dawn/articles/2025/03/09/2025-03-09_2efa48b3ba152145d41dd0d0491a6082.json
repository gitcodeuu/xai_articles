  "content": "India mounted a successful chase of a doable 252-run target against New Zealand on Sunday to win the ICC Champions Trophy in Dubai.\n\nSkipper Sharma was the top scorer with 76, while Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul helped take the Indian side over the finish line after losing five wickets. Michael Bracewell was the pick of the Kiwi bowlers, giving 28 runs in his 10 overs with 2 wickets.\n\nPandya dispatched Ravindra for six over the bowler’s head as he came to bowl his last over.\n\nThe Indian batters continued to rotate strike, bringing the required run-rate below six.\n\nPandya then went after O’Rourke in the next over, coming down the crease and powering it over mid-off. However, he was dismissed after misjudging a pull shot straight to Jamieson for a simple caught and bowled.\n\nO’Rourke came to bowl the second last over as veteran Jadeja and Rahul looked to help their side over the line.\n\nJadeja, probably participating in his last ODI match for India, swept O’Rourke on the last ball of the over to win the ICC Champions Trophy.\n\nAxar Patel was the next to depart as Bracewell bagged another wicket in his final over of the innings. A good spell from the spinner ended with 28 runs and two wickets in his 10 overs.\n\nPandya joined Rahil on the crease to stabilise the Indian innings as the batters tried to see through the Kiwi spinners.\n\nRavindra replaced Bracewell and gave away six runs in his ninth over as the batters comfortably rotated strike.\n\nO’Rourke was then elegantly driven to the boundary by Kl Rahul as the Kiwi pacer returned to bowl the death overs. Eight runs came from the pacer’s over to bring the Indian chase to 220 for five after 45 overs.\n\nThe Indian batters started to settle in for the chase as the Kiwis tried to restrict their strike rotation.\n\nO’Rourke was brought back into the attack by Santner as the Kiwis searched for a wicket.\n\nIyer then attacked Phillips as the required run-rate climbed above six, dispatching the Kiwi spinner for a 109m maximum over deep midwicket. And as fortune favours the brave, Iyer was dropped by Jamieson at long-on, who missed a routine catch.\n\nAxar then opened his arms against O’Rourke, who pulled the pacer past mid-on for another boundary.\n\nSantner brought himself into the attack and dismissed settled Iyer before he was dispatched for a six on the last ball of the over.\n\nIndia close the 40th over with the chase at 191 for the loss of four wickets.\n\nRohit continued with the new batter, Iyer, who followed his captain and smashed Santner for a boundary in the 21st over.\n\nThe Kiwi spinners did come back into the game, giving away only nine runs in the next five overs.\n\nThe pressure got to the Indian skipper as he stepped out against Ravindra, only to miss the ball and get stumped.\n\nThe spinners continued to keep it tight as the new pairing on the crease started to rotate strike.\n\nIyer released some pressure after he smashed Bracewell for a six over midwicket. The ball went high into the sky and was caught by Young on the boundary but the Kiwi fielder was touching the rope.\n\nIndian chase reached 136 for the loss of three wickets after 30 overs.\n\nIndian great Rohat Sharma reached his half-century as the second powerplay started, continuing with a risky style of play and smashing boundaries in each over.\n\nThe Kiwis failed to stop the Indian openers as Gill got into act, charging Ravindra over for his first six over long on.\n\nThe Indian batters looked comfortable rotating the strike before Phillips caught Gill on point for a blinder of a catch. One for the highlight reel.\n\nVeteran Virat Kohli was quickly dismissed on the second ball of his innings as he missed a flick on a tossed-up delivery, the ball crashing into his back leg for an LBW.\n\nIndia looked to stabilise their innings as Shreyas Iyer came down to join the skipper.\n\nIndia’s chase stood at 108 for the loss of two wickets after 20 overs.\n\nIndian skipper Rohit started the innings to a flyer as he smashed Jamieson for a six, pulling him on the second ball of the first over.\n\nThe Kiwi bowlers, after going for 22 in the first two overs, came back strongly and conceded only nine in the next three.\n\nSharma charged down the pitch to smash Nathan Smith, replacing Will O’Rourke, over long-on for a six in the sixth over as the Indian skipper freed his arms. Mitchell dropped Gill on mid-wicket; a one-handed dive from the Kiwi batter ends in vain. Sharma continued the onslaught against Smith, scoring 14 from the pacer’s second over.\n\nSantner brought himself into attack as the Kiwis searched for their first wicket, bowling an excellent over and giving away only a single.\n\nRavindra followed his skipper as spin started from both ends, however, the Indian batters happily rotated strike, taking four from it.\n\nThe Indian chase reached 64 for the no loss after the end of the first powerplay.\n\nNew Zealand kept the scoreboard ticking by rotating the strike, maintaining a run rate of around 4.6.\n\nDaryl Mitchell reached his half-century in 91 deliveries—the slowest fifty of his career—but struggled to accelerate before falling to Mohammad Shami, who claimed his first wicket of the innings.\n\nMichael Bracewell played an aggressive cameo, scoring a quickfire 53 off 40 balls, helping the Kiwis post 251 for 7 in 50 overs.\n\nKiwi skipper Santner was run out on the last delivery of the 49th over, trying to sneak in a double on a ball that went straight to Kohli at mid wicket. Excellent effort in the deep by the Indian great.\n\nA below-par total, it seems. The Kiwis will need to bowl with precision if they hope to trouble India’s star-studded batting lineup in the chase.\n\nMitchell and Phillips stabilised the innings; however, the run rate fell for the Black Caps.\n\nSharma continued with spin on both ends as pressure piled up on the Kiwis to up the ante against the Indian attack.\n\nChakravarthy dismissed Phillips in the 37th over after the Kiwi batter failed to read the googly. Phillips went for a cut but ended up missing the ball completely, which ended crashing into his stumps.\n\nBracewell came out to bat for the Kiwis as they searched for stability with the innings moving into the death overs.\n\nThe Kiwi total reached 172 for the loss of five wickets after 40 overs.\n\nRanvindra Jadeja got into the act as he dismissed Tom Latham in his third over, trapping the Kiwi batter in front of the wicket. He went for a sweep and missed it completely as the ball crashed into his pads.\n\nThe off spinner had trapped Latham in the previous over as well’ however, the ball was missing the stumps by a margin.\n\nBoth sides lose a review as we move towards deeper waters.\n\nPhillips joined Mitchell to build on the New Zealand innings as runs became scarce for the Kiwi side. Phillips dispatched Kuldeep for a huge six behind the bowler’s head after 81 balls without a boundary. The score kept ticking for the Kiwis as they reached 135 for the loss of four wickets after 30 overs.\n\nIndia continue to remain on top as four circulating spinners give no space to the Kiwi batters.\n\nKuldeep Yadav dismissed Ravindra on the first ball of his spell in the final, as the left-handed batter got stuck, and the ball crashed into the stumps.\n\nVeteran Kane Williamson came out to bat next but was dismissed by Yadav as he spooned the ball in the air for an easy catch for the leg spinner.\n\nThe Kiwis then tried stabilising the innings with two new batters at the crease, Tom Latham and Daryl Mitchell. Indian skipper Sharma kept spin from both ends to pile pressure onto the Kiwi batter as runs started to dry up for the Black Caps.\n\nIndia playing with four conventional spinners would be useful for the side on the Dubai International Stadium’s spinning pitch.\n\nLatham and Mitchell are on the crease with the Kiwi score at 101 for three after the loss of 3 wickets.\n\nThe Kiwis — after choosing to bat — started the innings with a flier as the openers looked to set a high target for the Indian side.\n\nNew Zealand only lost one wicket in the powerplay after Varun Chakravarthy trapped Will Young in front of the stumps for a leg before wicket, a leg spin that did not spin and went straight on.\n\nRachin Ravindra, on the other end, smashed four fours and a six as he collected 37 runs. New Zealand legend Kane Williamson came out to bat to build on the great start by the Kiwis.\n\nNew Zealand’s score reached 69 for the loss of one wicket after 10 overs.\n\nIndia, who refused to play in host nation Pakistan, have produced clinical performances to win all four of their matches in the United Arab Emirates, including a 44-run group-stage victory over the Black Caps last weekend — although both teams had already reached the semi-finals by then.\n\nIndia are heavy favourites to claim a record third Champions Trophy but Rohit Sharma’s men face a New Zealand side with plenty of firepower in the first major white-ball final between the teams in a quarter of a century.\n\nThe Men in Blue are on the verge of winning back-to-back International Cricket Council (ICC) trophies following last year’s T20 World Cup triumph but they have always found the resilient Kiwis a tall mountain to surmount.\n\nNew Zealand hold a 10-6 lead over their Asian rivals across all the ICC tournaments and if curated further, they have a 3-1 edge over India in the knockout matches.\n\nHowever, the Black Caps’ pace spearhead Matt Henry has been ruled out of the final due to an injury, the ICC said in a statement today.\n\nIndia have played all their matches in Dubai after they refused to tour hosts Pakistan.\n\nThe pitches have been vastly different in the two countries.\n\nPakistan tracks produced big totals, in contrast to the slow and turning decks of the Dubai stadium.\n\n“I think we have to kind of go in with an open mind of how the pitch will play, and then adjust accordingly,” New Zealand skipper Mitchell Santner told reporters yesterday.\n\nDespite their flawless displays in Dubai, India will not take anything for granted against New Zealand, who beat them by four wickets in the final of the 2000 event when it was named the ICC KnockOut Trophy.\n\nVarun Chakravarthy and Kuldeep Yadav, the right-hand and left-hand wrist-spinners, have bamboozled the opponents with Ravindra Jadeja and Axar Patel tying down the batters in a matrix of accuracy and boredom.\n\nNew Zealand’s biggest hopes of countering them will be Kane Williamson and Rachin Ravindra, the most competent batters against slow bowlers in their line-up.\n\nNew Zealand’s capable spin unit comprising captain Mitchell Santner, Michael Bracewell, Glenn Phillips and Ravindra can cause plenty of problems for India, who will aim to move ahead of Australia in the Champions Trophy winners list. Australia won the event in 2006 and 2009.\n\nNew Zealand beat India 3-0 in a Test series in their own backyard, a feat never registered before. India went on to lose in Australia. Both series defeats cost India a spot in the World Test Championship final.\n\nNearly 25 years ago, Chris Cairns’ well-timed century in Nairobi powered New Zealand past India to win the Knock Out Trophy, which remains the only limited-overs ICC trophy in New Zealand’s cabinet.\n\nThe Black Caps did add another in 2021 — beating India in the World Test Championship final at Southampton. In between, India were stopped in their tracks at the semi-final stage of the 2019 Cricket World Cup, losing a two-day rain-affected semifinal to New Zealand at Manchester.\n\nIndia: Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, KL Rahul, Rishabh Pant, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, Washington Sundar, Kuldeep Yadav, Harshit Rana, Mohammad Shami, Arshdeep Singh, Ravindra Jadeja, Varun Chakaravarthy.\n\nNew Zealand: Mitchell Santner (c), Michael Bracewell, Mark Chapman, Devon Conway, Lockie Ferguson, Matt Henry, Tom Latham, Daryl Mitchell, Will O’Rourke, Glenn Phillips, Rachin Ravindra, Nathan Smith, Kane Williamson, Will Young, Jacob Duffy.",
