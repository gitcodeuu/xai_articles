Together with industry leaders like Google, we are building a future where women do not just participate in technology but also lead it,” Ms Khawaja said.\n\nFarhan Qureshi, Google’s Country Director for Pakistan, said the company believed in the power of technology to transform lives and was committed to building a “future forward Pakistan” where everyone can reach their full potential in the digital economy.\n\nPakistan is the third-largest freelance economy in the world and has a rapidly growing digital talent pool.\n\n“We will continue to equip all Pakistanis with skills, opportunities and networks to succeed in a global economy with initiatives like Digital Safar, Google Career Certificates and our Google Developer Groups.\n\n“To drive this digital transformation, Google has launched initiatives focused on elevating Pakistani tech talent and developers with digital and AI skills, and getting the Pakistani workforce ready to seize new opportunities in the digital economy,” Farhan Qureshi said.\n\nGoogle Career Certificates (GCC) offers industry-recognised training in fields like cyber security, digital marketing and data analytics. Since its launch in 2022, over 100,000 scholarships have been awarded — nearly 50 per cent of them going to women.\n\nGoogle introduced an AI Essentials skilling programme last year to make the most out of artificial intelligence within just a few hours. It also launched Career Kamyabi, an initiative to close the employment gap for female GCC graduates.\n\nThai initiative\n\nIn collaboration with the United Nations and Depilex, the Thai embassy in Islamabad launched a scheme on Saturday to equip women in Sialkot with entrepreneurship skills. The initiative to advance women’s entrepreneurship aims to “enhance their skills, create new business opportunities, and promote financial sustainability for women-led enterprises in the region”.\n\nWomen entrepreneurs would be trained by practices prevalent in Thailand’s beauty industry.\n\nSialkot was selected as the pilot location due to the presence and outreach of both UN Women and the Depilex Training Institute, ensuring effective implementation and meaningful impact.\n\nSpeaking about the scheme, Rongvudhi Virabutr, Thailand’s ambassador to Pakistan, said the Thai government believes in women’s rights and recognises that economic empowerment is crucial for promoting gender equality. “By equipping women with professional skills in the beauty sector, we aim to foster their self-confidence and independence through the ability to earn their income,” the Thai envoy added.\n\nHe said this beauty industry initiative perfectly aligns with a commitment to women’s empowerment.\n\nJamshed Kazi, the country representative of UN Women Pakistan, and Masarrat Misbah, the founder of Depilex Clinics & Institute Pakistan, also addressed the event. They praised Depilex for promoting women’s empowerment through skill-building in the cosmetic industry.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025",
