On Sunday, he received Italian Cardinal Pietro Parolin, the Vatican’s secretary of state, and Edgar Pena Parra, a Venezuelan archbishop who is also a senior Vatican official.\n\nHe continued his treatment, doing both his physiotherapy and his breathing exercises, the press office said.\n\nFrancis also followed spiritual exercises being held at the Vatican via video link, though while he could see participants, they could not see the pope, it said.\n\nPeople who gathered in St Peter’s Square on Sunday, where Francis would usually stand at a Vatican window to read the Angelus to crowds below, said his presence was sorely missed.\n\n“He is a wonderful person who has given so much and I hope that he can return as soon as possible,” said Diana Desiderio, who volunteers with the civil protection agency in the Italian city of Pescara.\n\nShe and fellow volunteers are praying that Francis will “return to the window again and bring peace and serenity to everyone, because we need it”, she told AFP.\n\nThe pope ended the Angelus with his traditional call for peace in conflicts, “in particular in tormented Ukraine, Palestine, Israel, Lebanon, Myanmar, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo”.\n\nHe said he had “learnt with concern of the resumption of violence in some areas of Syria: I hope that they cease definitively, with full respect for all ethnic and religious components of society”.\n\nCatholics have also been gathering at the Gemelli hospital to pray for Francis or leave flowers, candles and cards.\n\nGiuseppe Antonio Perazzo, 74, was at the hospital for the second Sunday in a row, dressed smartly in a suit and tie in the hope that the pontiff might appear at the window.\n\nA sign he propped up in sight of the windows of the pope’s rooms urged the Argentine pontiff — a notoriously headstrong patient — to “keep doing what the doctors and nurses tell you to do”.",
