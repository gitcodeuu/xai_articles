  "content": "MONTREAL: Twelve people were injured when masked gunmen indiscriminately opened fire at a pub in Toronto, Canadian police said on Saturday, adding they were looking for three male suspects.\n\nPolice did not provide a motive for the attack, which took place late on Friday in an eastern part of Canada’s largest city. All of the victims were hospitalised but their lives were not in danger.\n\n“Twelve injured, including six with gunshot wounds… Injuries non-life-threatening,” Toronto police said on X.\n\n“Three male shooting suspects… Deploying all available resources to locate and arrest those responsible.” The suspects were armed with an assault rifle and handguns, police told reporters at the scene.\n\n“They walked into the bar. They produced their guns, and they opened fire indiscriminately on the people sitting inside the bar,” police superintendent Paul MacIntyre said.\n\n“The motive for this shooting right now remains unclear. We’re chasing down all leads,” he added. MacIntyre, who is with the organised crime enforcement unit, said some of the victims had been injured by broken glass.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025",
