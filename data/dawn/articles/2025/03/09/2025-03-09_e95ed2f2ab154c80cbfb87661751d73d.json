The first instalment of the loan is currently under review, and if successful, Pakistan will receive an additional $1bn.\n\nSecuring external financing has previously been a key condition for the IMF to approve bail-out deals for Pakistan.\n\nThe country needs to repay over $22bn in external debt in fiscal year 2025, including nearly $13bn in bilateral deposits, according to the credit rating agency Fitch.\n\nWith limited reserves and high external debt repayments, Pakistan has struggled to meet its international financial obligations while also maintaining economic stability.\n\nAccording to the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) latest data, the country’s total foreign exchange reserves as of Feb 28 stood at $15.87bn, of which $11.25bn is held by the central bank and $4.62bn by commercial banks.\n\nAround the same time last year, the country’s total foreign exchange reserves were $13bn, with SBP holdings at $7.9bn — indicating a significant improvement over the past year.\n\nForeign exchange reserves are essential for paying off international debt obligations, supporting the value of the natio­nal currency and ensuring economic stability in times of financial crisis. A decline in reserves can lead to currency depreciation, making imports more expensive and leading to inflation.\n\nPakistan has long struggled with a balance of payments (BoP) crisis — a situation when a country spends more foreign currency than it earns — relying on international loans and support from allies like China, Saudi Arabia and the IMF to prevent an economic collapse.\n\nThrough the China-Pak­istan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) and other inv­es­tment projects, China has been a key economic partner for Pakistan. Beijing has invested billions of dollars in infrastructure, energy and transportation projects, provided financial assistance to help Pakistan manage economic shocks and extended loan repayment deadlines to ensure macroeconomic stability.\n\n‘Strong position’\n\nThe finance ministry official insisted that the latest rollover strengthens Pakistan’s economic position at a time when it is engaged in critical negotiations with the IMF.\n\nPakistan’s $7bn loan programme requires the country to implement economic reforms, maintain fiscal discipline and meet revenue and structural adjustment targets.\n\nThe IMF delegation, led by its senior representatives, is currently in Islamabad, meeting with Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb.\n\nFormal policy-level talks are set to begin on Monday (tomorrow), where an IMF staff mission led by Nathan Porter would review the overall economic situation and Pakistan’s commitments under the loan agreement. In earlier meetings, Pakistan has assured the IMF of its commitment to fiscal discipline and structural reforms, which are essential for securing further loan tranches.\n\nThe IMF delegation has been briefed on the country’s macroeconomic situation, revenue collection and progress on structural reforms. The government says it remains committed to meeting the conditions of its $7bn loan programme.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025",
