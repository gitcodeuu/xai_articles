  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Nat­ional Party (BNP) Chief Sardar Akhtar Jan Mengal said that governments in the past took billions of dollars from the US in the name of jihad in Afghanistan, and now Pakistan was suffering the consequences of those actions.\n\nWhile speaking to the media on Saturday, he said the law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, particularly in Waziristan, was a direct result of past policies.\n\nHe accused the state of using people for its objectives and then abandoning them, leading to a situation where former allies turned foes and fought against Pakistan’s military.\n\nRegarding the situation in Balochistan, the BNP-M leader asserted that the government has intensified actions and in response, militants have escalated their operations in Balochistan.\n\nHe accused “powerful forces” of abducting Baloch youth, while Baloch separatists continued to carry out their attacks.\n\nMr Mengal condemned the alleged enforced disappearances and killings of Baloch youth.\n\nHe expressed confidence in Balochistan’s future, stating that if the youth persist in their struggle, their sacrifices will not be in vain. He stated that his party has always faced oppression, and persecution under the current government won’t deter them.\n\nHe reminded that hundreds of BNP workers have been martyred, and despite numerous FIRs against them, the party has never wavered in its commitment.\n\nHe vowed that BNP members would sacrifice their lives for the prosperity of the Baloch people.\n\nMr Mengal dismissed the current provincial government as a mere puppet, asserting that it offers no benefit to the Baloch people and will only bring more suffering as long as it remains in power.\n\nOther BNP-M leaders, including Mir Shafi Mengal, Ayub Alizai, Saeed Ahmed Musiani, Naseebullah Mengal and Mir Feroz Khan Mengal, were also present on the occasion.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025",
