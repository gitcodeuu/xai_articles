She added that the floods destroyed thousands of acres of crops and livelihoods. She warned that climate change and environmentally destructive projects were worsening women’s economic and social exploitation.\n\nShe also emphasised that the gender-based wage disparity and continuous informalisation of the economy and production had led to widespread lawlessness, which was disproportionately affecting women. The number of women working in informal sectors has risen rapidly, exacerbating their economic vulnerability.\n\nNational Trade Union Federation (NTUF) General Secretary Nasir Mansoor said that the Indus River is a lifeline for Pakistan and in particular Sindh, and it is being blocked under the pretext of water management projects, putting 4.9 million hectares of Sindh’s agricultural land at risk of desertification.\n\nRenowned writer Noorul Huda Shah said that climate change had already made the lives of the poor populace of Sindh miserable and now the federal government’s six-canal project on the Indus River was likely to make it worse. She said that it was a matter of survival of future generations and that the elite seem the least bothered about this because they have the means to move out of the country.\n\nAsad Iqbal Butt of the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan said that Karachi was most vulnerable to the six-canal project as the city was at the tail end of the Indus River. He added that the rulers were lying about the project and hiding the fact that the project was intended to benefit capitalists and only one province.\n\nMahnaz Rahman said that climate change was adversely affecting women and diminishing their economic, social, and legal powers. She said that dependence on fossil fuels was primarily responsible for climate change and the phenomenon was playing havoc with the lives of poor people.\n\nTransgender activist Kami Sid said that the capitalist system has brainwashed people into thinking about themselves only. Kami added that transgender people were also impacted by climate change and their needs should be taken into consideration when formulating policies.\n\nThe rally demanded that the blockade and theft of Indus River water be stopped and the government ensure fair distribution of water under the 1991 Water Accord and abandon environmentally destructive policies.\n\nThe participants also called upon the authorities to guarantee living wages for women workers, eliminate gender-based wage disparities, abolish all discriminatory laws against women and transgender persons, protect women from workplace harassment and enforce the formation of anti-harassment committees in all institutions.\n\nTheir demands include recovery of all missing political and social activists, concrete measures to promote girls’ education and increase the number of girls’ schools, end media restrictions and censorship and stop leasing agricultural land to foreign entities under the guise of cooperative farming.\n\nFisherfolk rally\n\nOn the occasion of Women’s Day, hundreds of fisherfolk women from different parts of Karachi gathered at Ibrahim Hyderi to demand from the government to immediately cancel the six-canal project on the Indus River.\n\nThey chanted slogans such as “No more canals on the Indus River! Let it flow naturally!”\n\nWhile addressing the gathering, Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum chairman Mehran Ali Shah reminded that water was everything for fisher folk. “We cannot survive without water,” he said, while urging the government to release Sindh’s due share of water as per the 1991 Water Accord.\n\nEvent at KPC\n\nWomen’s Day was also commemorated at the Karachi Press Club (KPC) where speakers spoke about the day’s significance in light of raising awareness among women and their capacity building.\n\nThe Director General of the Press Information Department, Irum Tanveer, was of the view that she has noticed men’s attitude towards women and also women’s attitude towards women. “We blame men for many things. But do other women support us?” She asked. “We need to become each other’s strength,” she pointed out.\n\nResident Director of Aurat Foundation Muneezeh Khan and Executive Director of NowCommunities Farhat Perveen also spoke.\n\nPTI’s ‘Black Day’\n\nMeanwhile, almost every political party either organised an event or issue a statement to mark the day.\n\nThe women wing of the opposition Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) marked the day as a ‘Black Day’ in protest against the alleged injustices and oppression faced by women in Pakistan.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, PTI leader Sarina Khan compared the global celebration of women’s rights with the situation in Pakistan, lamenting, “While women worldwide celebrate this day in vibrant attire, women in Pakistan continue to endure oppression. How can we celebrate Women’s Day in such circumstances? We wear black today as a symbol of protest against the injustices faced by women.”\n\nPPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, party’s women wing president Faryal Talpur, MQM-P chairman Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui and many other leaders issued their statements to congratulate the women on International Women’s Day.\n\nIn his statement German Consul General in Karachi Dr Rüdiger Lotz said: “No society which excludes half of its members will ever succeed! Let’s collectively accelerate action for women’s equality.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025",
