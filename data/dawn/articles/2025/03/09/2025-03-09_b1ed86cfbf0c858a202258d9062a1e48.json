It urged “the international community and international and regional funding institutions to swiftly provide the necessary support”.\n\nTrump triggered global outrage when he suggested the US “take over” Gaza and turn it into the “Riviera of the Middle East”, while forcing its Palestinian inhabitants to relocate to Egypt or Jordan.\n\nEthnic cleansing, war crime\n\nPakistan stressed upon the Muslim nations to make it unequivocally clear that any attempt to forcibly relocate the Palestinian people, whether from Gaza or the West Bank, was ethnic cleansing and a war crime under international law.\n\nIn a statement at the Extraordinary Session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers, Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said Islamic bloc must categorically reject any proposal that seeks to eject the Palestinians from their own homeland.\n\nNo external force has the right to dictate their future to the Palestinians. They must determine their own future, through an exercise of self-determination. The OIC must stand united against any sinister agenda aimed at altering the demography of the occupied Palestinian territories, he added.\n\nMr Dar presented Pakistan’s urgent recommendations, including a full and immediate implementation of the three phases of the ceasefire agreement, which included a permanent cessation of hostilities, the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza, unrestricted humanitarian access, and a comprehensive reconstruction plan.\n\nEgyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty welcomed the OIC endorsement and said he now hoped to gain support from the wider international community, including the United States.\n\n“The next step is for the plan to become an international plan through adoption by the European Union and international parties such as Japan, Russia, China and others,” Abdelatty said.\n\n“This is what we will seek and we have contact with all parties, including the American party.”\n\nThe four European governments welcomed the plan’s proposal for Gaza to return to the control of the West Bank-based Palestinian Authority after nearly two decades of Hamas rule. “We are clear that Hamas must neither govern Gaza nor be a threat to Israel anymore,” they said in their statement.\n\n“We commend the serious efforts of all involved stakeholders and appreciate the important signal the Arab states have sent by jointly developing this recovery and reconstruction plan,” they added.\n\nHowever, the Egyptian proposal has already been cold-shouldered by Israel and the United States. It “does not meet the expectations” of Washington, State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters on Thursday.\n\nTrump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff gave a more positive reaction, however, calling the plan a “good-faith first step from the Egyptians”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 9th, 2025",
