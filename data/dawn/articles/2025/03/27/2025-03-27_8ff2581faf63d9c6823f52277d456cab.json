They lead the group on goal difference from Afghanistan, who beat Myanmar 2-1 earlier in the day.\n\nSyria started strongly in the game played in neutral Saudi Arabia, pushing Pakistan back and took the lead in the 23rd minute when Amar Ramadan’s pinpoint corner kick was nodded in by defender Ahmed Faqa.\n\nPakistan tried to get back into the game but failed to create decent chances and Syria got their second in the 56th through Saudi Pro League’s all-time top-scorer Omar Al Somah; the Al-Orobah striker putting the ball into the back of the net after a goalmouth scramble.\n\nConstantine sent on fresh legs to get a foothold back into the game but Syria easily held on. His side will look to bounce back when they meet Myanmar while Syria face Afghanistan, with both matches to be contested on June 10.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
