It can be contacted on 0300-5849255 (secretary), 0334-9086169 (admin officer), 091-9333666, or 091-2590846.\n\nMeanwhile, state broadcaster PTV News provided a weather advisory on X, warning people of “a severe risk of floods and landslides on Torghar, Battagram, Shangla, Lower Kohistan, Tatta Pani, Gilgit, Hunza and Swat roads”, discouraging unnecessary travel in these areas.\n\nAccording to the post, GB’s Somro Bridge, Ghanche, Saltoro Bridge and Baghicha (Skardu) Bridge were severely damaged and citizens were urged to completely avoid travel.\n\nIt added that traffic was suspended on the Jaglot-Skardu road, while routes in Ghizer district, Naltar Road, Babusar Top Road and around Hunza were closed, with tourists discouraged from travelling.\n\nMeanwhile, the provincial management service (PMS) chairman requested in a letter that the KP finance secretary deduct a day’s salary from all PMS officers and redirect the money for relief work, further requesting that the secretary redirect his “whole salary”.\n\nIn a statement on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was “deeply anguished by the devastation caused by cloudbursts and flash floods in KP and northern Pakistan”.\n\nExtending his heartfelt condolences and expressing solidarity, he affirmed: “The government is mobilising all resources for rescue and relief operations.”\n\nThe premier added that he met National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik and directed him to “expedite rescue operations in the nine affected districts of Swat, Buner, Bajaur, Torghar, Mansehra, Shangla, and Battagram, with urgent focus on Bajaur and Battagram”.\n\n“Immediate relief is being provided to stranded residents, medical aid to the injured, and heavy machinery has been deployed to clear roads and restore connectivity,” PM Shehbaz said.\n\nBuner Police’s public relations officer Israr Khan, put the district’s death toll at 207, compared to the 204 stated by the PDMA.\n\nDC Qayum, in a statement, ordered a ban on the entry of private vehicles into Buner, stating that it was hindering rescue and relief work.\n\nPTI’s Barrister Gohar, who is an MNA from Buner, and MPA Riaz Khan visited the flood-hit area of Beshonai and met the bereaved families who lost their loved ones in the floods, the KP government said.\n\nLater, Gohar chaired a meeting at the Buner DC’s office, which was attended by CM Gandapur, the KP chief secretary, provincial ministers and other senior officials.\n\n“Instructions were given to the relevant departments and district administration to expedite the search for missing persons, rehabilitation, and road clearance operations in the affected areas,” a post on Gohar’s X account read.\n\nAs the nation observed a day of mourning for the five crew members who died in a helicopter crash during rescue efforts, the national flag flew at half-mast at Governor House in Peshawar.\n\nCM Gandapur chaired an emergency meeting in Peshawar to review the damage caused by cloudbursts, heavy rains and flash floods across the province, which was attended by the chief secretary, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, senior officials and PDMA representatives, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\nOfficials said rescue operations were largely completed and the focus was now on relief and rehabilitation.\n\nThe meeting’s participants were informed that 309 people were killed and 23 were injured in various rain and flood-related incidents, while 63 houses were partially damaged. Surveys of damage to roads and other infrastructure are still underway.\n\n“Work is being carried out to restore road links to cut-off areas, and medical teams, food, medicines, and essential supplies are being sent to the affected districts,” the report read.\n\nThe meeting was informed that the provincial government has released Rs 1.5 billion to the PDMA for rescue, relief, and compensation, while releasing another Rs 1.5bn to the communication and works department for the repair of roads and infrastructure.\n\nIn addition, Rs500 million was allocated to deputy commissioners to compensate the families of those killed in the flooding.\n\n“The provincial government stands firmly with the people in this difficult time and will use all available resources for their rehabilitation,” the chief minister said at the meeting.\n\nExpressing solidarity with the bereaved families, CM Gandapur praised the provincial and district administrations for their swift response, saying their performance in the crisis had been commendable and urged them to maintain their commitment during the relief and rehabilitation phase.\n\n“Road connectivity must be restored as quickly as possible, with helicopters used to deliver aid to inaccessible areas,” the CM ordered. “Compensation payments must be completed within two days and additional medical staff need to be deployed from neighbouring districts.\n\n“Food supplies must be ensured so that no affected family faces shortages.”\n\nThe chief minister also instructed the chief secretary and the PDMA to strengthen monitoring and coordination between federal and provincial agencies, mobilise heavy machinery for reconstruction and immediately dispatch all available food and non-food items to flood-hit districts.\n\nEarlier, the CM visited Buner to review the damage caused by flooding and ongoing relief operations, according to a post on X by the KP government.\n\n“The divisional and district administration will brief the chief minister on human and financial losses and relief activities,” the government wrote. “The chief minister will also visit the affected areas and meet with the affected families.”\n\nThe post added that members of the provincial cabinet, the chief secretary, and other officials would accompany CM Gandapur.\n\nWhile speaking to reporters in the area, the chief minister said that rescue operations have started and the government is working to clear roads blocked by the flooding.\n\n“Routes in some areas have been restored; however, some have not,” he said. “We have also requested helicopters. Our goal right now is to restore the routes.\n\n“I want to let people know that the provincial government compensate citizens fully for damages to their homes,” the chief minister added. “We are in touch with the NDMA and they will provide us with whatever we need.”\n\nFederal Minister Muqam, visited areas in Buner affected by floods today to assess the damage and meet with victims, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\nThe minister, who is also the president of the PML-N in KP, was accompanied by the Malakand commissioner and other senior officials.\n\nMuqam stated that he was visiting on the instructions of PM Shehbaz, who is personally overseeing the relief operation. “This is not the time for politics; the entire nation stands with victims,” he said.\n\nThe minister added that the prime minister would also be visiting the affected districts soon, but did not say specifically when.\n\nDuring his visit, Muqam directed officials to expedite relief efforts, which are being supported by the local police and district administration. He met with affected families, offering condolences and reviewing ongoing relief activities.\n\nThe minister noted that the local administration, the Pakistan Army, and Frontier Corps were all participating in the rescue operation.\n\n“Many villages have been completely destroyed and prayers are being offered for those still missing,” he said. “Medical camps have been established in affected areas and the federal government will provide all necessary resources.”\n\nAccording to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), 11 people were killed, 25 were injured and four were reported missing during the past 48 hours.\n\nThe authority added that 92 houses were partially damaged, while 99 were fully destroyed, citing initial reports. Detailed assessments were still ongoing\n\nInterior Minister Shams Lone said that the bridge on the Baltistan Highway was swept away in the flood, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit for the second day.\n\nHe said that since July 22, “thirty-five people died, 35 were injured and four are missing in the flood waves. Similarly, 318 houses have been completely demolished and 674 have been partially damaged.”\n\nLone said that the GB government does not have the resources, so the Army has taken steps to help in relief efforts.\n\n“The Pakistan Army played an important role in the rehabilitation after the massive destruction caused by the Babusar flood and provided food and other essential items to the victims of Ghizer today,” he said. “The Army has played an important role and is still at the forefront in this difficult phase.”\n\nLater, Rescue Information Officer Shakriz said in a statement that the body of a person previously reported missing had been recovered, bringing the overall death toll in the region to 36.\n\nMeanwhile, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said a “great number of tourists” were trapped in the Naltar Valley as the land route was disconnected after floodwaters washed away a huge chunk of the Naltar Expressway.\n\nIn his statement, the official said the power supply in the area had been suspended as the three power plants situated there were shut down due to the floods.\n\nAccording to Faraq, river waters from the Jaglot Goro stream entered several houses and restaurants in low-lying areas.\n\nHe added that floods across the province caused severe damage to public property and infrastructure.\n\n“Flooding in four locations in Gilgit district today severely damaged four power plants, a bridge and an expressway, while a large number of buildings were submerged in Jaglot Guru.”\n\nFaraq said that the floods in Naltar Valley damaged three power plants, cutting off power supply to thousands of people.\n\n“A power plant and a bridge were also damaged in Bagrot, cutting off power, while land communication was suspended due to the bridge being washed away,” Faraq said.\n\n“A flood relay containing heavy stones swept away a house within the limits of Allahwali Lake in Astore in the afternoon,” he added. “Local people ran to save their lives.”\n\nThe KP PDMA told AFP that around 2,000 rescue workers were engaged in recovering bodies from the debris and carrying out relief operations in nine affected districts.\n\nRescue 1122 Director General Muhammad Tayyab Abdullah told Dawn.com that an elite rescue squad of 80 individuals has been formed for areas where operations are facing “intense difficulty”.\n\n“In the past 12 hours, 3,542 emergencies have been responded to, while 76 vehicles are taking part in the rescue operations,” he detailed.\n\nDG Abdullah noted that the teams were facing challenges in their activities because of ruined roads, while people were also not able to contact helplines due to damaged mobile towers.\n\nSimilarly, KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told AFP: “Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances.\n\n“Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,” he highlighted.\n\n“They are trying to evacuate survivors, but very few people are relocating due to the deaths of their relatives or loved ones being trapped in the debris.”\n\nMeanwhile, PTV News reported that Pakistan Army personnel have arrived in Buner as part of relief efforts. The broadcaster said in a post on X that special equipment from the Army Corps of Engineers will be used to recover bodies and those injured trapped underneath layers of mud.\n\n“Rations and other supplies are being provided through Pakistan Army helicopters, and people are being evacuated from flood-hit areas to safe locations,” PTV News wrote.\n\nA statement issued by Buner’s Rescue 1122 said DG Abdullah, Buner Operations Director Mir Alam, North Region Operations Director Arshad Iqbal and the district emergency officer were supervising the operation themselves.\n\nThe Rescue DG urged the public not to go near floodwaters, rainwater drains or bridges, and contact the 1122 helpline in the case of an emergency.\n\nIn Battagram, two more bodies were recovered at the Malkal Gali-Neel Band village, which had been impacted by a cloudburst on early Thursday, according to Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Khan.\n\nThe rescue operations had resumed at 6am after being suspended at 7:30pm yesterday due to nightfall and the challenging terrain.\n\nFlash floods also severely impacted the power infrastructure in Swat, as floodwaters entered the 132KV Swat grid station, causing the tripping of 41 feeders and the complete suspension of electric supply across the region.\n\nThe KP PDMA has said rainfall would continue until August 21 in different parts of the province.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteoro­logical Department (PMD) has also warned the Balochistan government to take emergency measures to prepare for a new spell of monsoon rains in the province, which will start from Aug 18 and continue until Aug 22.\n\nBeshonai village in Buner, a settlement of more than 80 households, was left in ruins a day after flash flooding tore through the village centre.\n\nAccording to a Dawn.com correspondent on the ground, a steady stream was calmly running beneath the large stones the flood brought in, and though there are some remaining houses along the bank of the stream, most others were completely washed away, along with their inhabitants.\n\nHakeem Jan, a resident of a nearby village, told Dawn.com that he heard “loud bursts” in the mountains, then “a huge rally of water and big stones colliding and raging downward”.\n\n“Multiple cloudbursts in the upper portion of the Elum valley caught the villagers unguarded, leaving them with no time to escape,” Jan said. “The survivors are the children who were at school away from the village or the ones who are on jobs outside Buner.”\n\nOne survivor, Gul Bacha, told Dawn.com, “Most people working in the relief operations are outsiders and there are no confirmed figures on the death toll here. I was upstream when I saw a big wave of black water coming in the direction of our village.\n\n“I ran like crazy and was screaming to the villagers … some people heard me and ran, but most people downstream were caught unawares.”\n\nJaved Khan, a schoolteacher who lost several relatives, told Dawn.com that while no bodies were recovered in Beshornarry, “seventy corpses were swept away and recovered in Peer Baba and Dagar, later laid to rest by locals”.\n\nPeer Baba Union Council Nazim Abbas Shaheen told Dawn.com that accessibility was a major hurdle. “It is almost impossible to bring heavy machinery into the affected areas,” he said.\n\nIn Qadar Nagar, another valley in the area affected by the floods, a collective funeral for 56 people was offered, where one family lost 40 people. The two survivors among them were a father and his son, who were at Islamabad airport to collect another son who had returned home from abroad.\n\nAfter hitting Beshonai village and Qadar Nagar, the floodwater left behind wrecked houses and destroyed vehicles in its path, affecting major towns and villages. Images taken by a correspondent on the ground showed cars swept away and lodged in buildings, as well as flooded school yards.\n\nAdditional input from Umaid Ali and AFP.",
