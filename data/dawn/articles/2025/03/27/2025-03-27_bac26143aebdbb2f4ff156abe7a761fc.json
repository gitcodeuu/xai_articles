They said an Afghan SIM card was recovered from his possession, which confirmed his connections with the militants from across the border. “A Kalashnikov and two hand grenades were also recovered from his possession.”\n\nThe officials said the TTP commander and his accomplices posed a stiff resistance to the forces during the exchange of fire, which continued for two hours. “His accomplices managed to flee, taking advantage of the darkness in the nearby mountains.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Dera police claimed to have killed a suspected militant in a joint operation with CTD in Ratta Kulachi area in the limits of Shorkot police station.\n\nA police spokesman said the joint operation was carried out following credible reports about the presence of militants in the area. He said acting on a tip-off, the Shorkot police along with a CTD team raided the hideout. “As soon as the law enforcement personnel reached the site, the suspects opened fire upon seeing the police team.”\n\nHe said the police returned the fire, resulting in the death of an alleged attacker. “The security forces cordoned off the area and launched a search operation keeping in view the possibility of the presence of more suspects there.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
