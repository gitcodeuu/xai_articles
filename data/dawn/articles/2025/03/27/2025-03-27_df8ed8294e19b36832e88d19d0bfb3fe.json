  "content": "KARACHI: The first of five special Eid trains announced by the Pakistan Railways to manage extra rush of passengers during the Eid holidays chugged out from Platform No 2 of Cantonment Railway Station on Wednesday.\n\nWith Lahore as its final destination, the first Eid train will also be making stops at Hyderabad, Tando Adam, Nawabshah, Rohri, Rahimyar Khan, Khanpur, Bahawalpur, Lodhran, Multan, Khanewal, Sahiwal, Yousufwala and Kot Lakhpat on its way there.\n\nIt is expected to reach Lahore around 10am on Thursday.\n\nAyesha and her two children, from Lahore originally, were heading back there after spending a good three months in Karachi. “We did all our Eid shopping from Karachi,” said Ayesha. On being asked about her bighearted hosts who hosted her during her extended stay, she said that she stayed with her sister here. “My sister also stayed with me in Lahore before my trip here,” she laughed.\n\nKilling two birds with one stone, many of the passengers were traveling not just to spend Eid with their loved ones, but they were also going to another city to attend personal engagements such as family weddings.\n\nOne family headed to Bahawalpur had lots of suitcases, which prompted asking if ‘travelling light’ was something they didn’t quite believe in. “Besides our Eid clothes, the suitcases also have our wedding shopping for my brother-in-law’s wedding,” explained Ms Nadeem.\n\nA father with two daughters, also heading for Bahawalpur, said that after Eid they were going to attend a wedding, too. “Their mother is already there. She left much earlier as her input was required in the wedding preparations. Only I stayed back because of my job and the children’s school. Now we are all off to join her,” he said happily.\n\nMohammed Ramazan, another passenger also spotted with access baggage, said that he was going to Sukkur to get married there soon after Eid.\n\nMeanwhile, police personnel stayed vigilant on the platforms, checking passengers’ luggage, etc.\n\n“We are glad that the people are also cooperating with us. Their safety is of prime importance to us,” a Railways police officer told Dawn.\n\nThe first special Eid train, with a total capacity of 1,062 passengers, comprises 16 coaches, which include two each Air Conditioned Business Class and AC Standard coaches, 10 Economy Class coaches, one power van and one brake van.\n\nThe fare, according to the distances travelled, started with Rs700 to Rs4,300 for Economy Class, Rs1,100 to Rs7,050 for AC Standard and from Rs1,850 to Rs9,800 for AC Business passengers.\n\nThree of the five special trains have Karachi departures while one is to leave from Lahore and the other from Quetta.\n\nEarlier, the Federal Minister for Railways, Mohammad Hanif Abbasi, visited Quetta Railway Station along with Chairman Railways Syed Mazhar Ali Shah and CEO Railways Aamir Ali Baloch.\n\nHe appreciated the safety measures undertaken at the station along with the swift repair work carried out on the damaged Jaffar Express.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
