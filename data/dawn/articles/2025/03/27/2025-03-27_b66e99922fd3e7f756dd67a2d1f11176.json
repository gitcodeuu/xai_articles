  "content": "QUETTA: Nadia and Iqra Baloch, sisters of BYC Central Organiser Mahrang Baloch, condemned her arrest and alleged she been subjected to mental torture, expressing fear she might be harmed in jail.\n\nSpeaking at a presser along with Advocate Imran Baloch, they said over 100 supporters and workers of BYC were arrested and kept at different police stations and jails.\n\nDespite receiving bail from the courts, they were released and their families were denied the right to meet them. The lawyer said between 115 and 125 individuals were detained at different police stations and jails, though officially the arrest of 48 people, including two women, was confirmed.\n\nThey said that international human rights organisations had highlighted that Dr Mahrang was unlawfully imprisoned with the objective of silencing the voice raised against the violation of basic human rights in Balochistan. “Mahrang is not a criminal; she is a leading human rights advocate,” they said.\n\nNadia Baloch said that despite clear court orders, government officials were refusing to comply and were not allowing family members to meet with their loved ones.\n\n“Jail authorities are not allowing food from home to BYC people,” Mahrang’s sisters and lawyer claimed, requesting rights activists, politicians, and all segments of society to raise their voices against this inhumane treatment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
