  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The National Commission for Minorities Bill 2025 was under active review on Wednesday as the Senate Standing Committee on Human Rights subcommittee deliberated its key provisions.\n\nWith strong backing from government officials and lawmakers, the bill aimed to establish a national body dedicated to protecting and promoting the rights of minority communities in Pakistan.\n\nDuring the meeting, the chairman of the committee, Senator Syed Ali Zafar, stressed the importance of ensuring the bill reflected the diverse needs of minorities while maintaining transparency and fairness.\n\n“A law passed today will shape the future for years to come, so careful deliberation is essential,” he stated.\n\nA statement issued here said that in response to a proposal by Farhatullah Babar, Syed Ali Zafar endorsed a rotational system for the chairperson, ensuring representation from all provinces.\n\n“This will prevent any region from being overlooked in the leadership selection process,” he noted.\n\nMinister of State for Religious Affairs Khealdas Kohistani, strongly advocated for the bill, calling for its expedited passage.\n\n“This legislation is critical for strengthening the protection of minority rights in Pakistan,” he said, underscoring the government’s commitment to equal rights for all citizens.\n\nSenator Poonjo Bheel proposed that the chairperson should have extensive legal expertise, preferably with experience in high court practice.\n\n“A highly qualified chairman with a fixed tenure will bring stability and credibility to the commission,” he emphasised.\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Danesh Kumar suggested setting clear eligibility criteria for commission members, including a minimum age of 30 years and a rotation system for balanced provincial representation.\n\nHis proposal was supported by Senator Gurdeep Singh, who called for the inclusion of all religious minorities, particularly Sikhs, to reflect their historical contributions.\n\nMNA Asfanyar M Bhandara recommended reopening two temples currently under the Capital Development Authority’s (CDA) control as a symbolic gesture of religious freedom.\n\n“This will send a strong message of inclusivity and commitment to minority rights,” he asserted.\n\nFarhatullah Babar voiced concerns about the selection process for the commission’s leadership, arguing that appointments should be made through a consultative process rather than a single authority.\n\n“The commission should function like the National Commission for Human Rights (NCHR), where appointments are made by parliament, ensuring independence and accountability,” he stated.\n\nAdditionally, Farhatfullah Babar warned against administrative delays that could render the commission inactive due to unfilled vacancies.\n\nHe proposed implementing a structured procedure for timely appointments and renewals, along with mandatory biannual reporting to ensure transparency and oversight.\n\nThe committee will continue its discussions in the coming weeks to refine the bill before its presentation to parliament.\n\n“The suggestions made today are crucial to ensuring the commission effectively fulfils its mandate,” Syed Ali Zafar concluded.\n\nMembers observed that with strong support from lawmakers and officials, the National Commission for Minorities Bill 2025 was poised to become a landmark piece of legislation, reinforcing the government’s commitment to justice, equality and human rights for all citizens.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
