Over 50 are based in China, while others are in Taiwan, Iran, Pakistan, South Africa and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe listings are intended to restrict China’s ability to develop high-performance computing capabilities, quantum technologies and advanced AI, and impede China’s development of its hypersonic weapons programme.\n\nChina’s foreign ministry, in response to an enquiry on Wednesday, condemned the US move and said the country will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Washington said it firmly opposed “these acts taken by the US and demand that it immediately stop using military-related issues as pretexts to politicise, instrumentalise and weaponise trade and tech issues.”\n\nUS commerce official Jeffrey Kessler said the administration aims to prevent “US technologies and goods from being misused for high performance computing, hypersonic missiles, military aircraft training, and UAVs (drones) that threaten our national security.”\n\nWhen Inspur Group was placed on the list in 2023, executives from AMD and Nvidia were questioned about their dealings with the company. At the time, chip industry insiders and their advisers said firms were trying to assess whether they had to halt supplying Inspur’s subsidiaries.\n\nReuters could not immediately determine whether the US companies continued to do business with the subsidiaries.\n\nNvidia declined to comment, and AMD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nChinese firms Nettrix Information Industry Co, Suma Technology Co and Suma-USI Electronics are among the other companies added to the list. The US said they were added for helping develop Chinese exa-scale supercomputers, which can process vast amounts of data at very high speeds and conduct large-scale simulations.\n\nThe companies also provided manufacturing capabilities to Sugon, also known as Dawning Information Industry Co, a computer server manufacturer added to the Entity List in 2019 for building supercomputers used by the military, the US said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
