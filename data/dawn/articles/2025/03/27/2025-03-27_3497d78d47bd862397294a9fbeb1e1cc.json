ASD begins at the age of three and lasts throughout a person’s life, although symptoms may improve over time.\n\nStudies have shown that one-third of parents of children with ASD noticed symptoms before their child’s first birthday while others saw noticeable signs around the end of the child’s second year.\n\nSome children with ASD seem to develop normally until around 18 to 24 months of age and then stop gaining new skills, or they lose the skills they once had, experts say.\n\nRenowned actor and social activist Hamza Ali Abbasi, who attended the event, stressed that every person in society should play a role in promoting early intervention for children with autism.\n\nDr Nosheen Kazmi, Consultant Psychiatrist and Lead Autism Services at Shifa Hospital highlighted that while consolidated data on autism in Pakistan was unavailable, there was a noticeable increase in the number of children being diagnosed with the condition.\n\nDr Faiza Badar underscored the crucial role of therapists in improving behaviour, communication and activities of daily living in children with autism.\n\nThe event was attended by teachers working with autistic children, parents of children diagnosed with ASD and healthcare professionals.\n\nThey engaged in discussions on the importance of early diagnosis, intervention and therapy.\n\nAccording to the Autism Society of Pakistan, there is no reliable data to estimate the occurrence of autism in Pakistan, but some estimates put it at around 350,000 incidences.\n\nBut in the USA the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) determined that approximately 1 in 59 children is diagnosed with ASD.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
