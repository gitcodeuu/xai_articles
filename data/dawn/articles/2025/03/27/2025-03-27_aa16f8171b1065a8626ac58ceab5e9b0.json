As a consequence, a meeting of the Advisory Committee of the Indus River System Authority (Irsa) decided on Wednesday to make only “drinking supplies” for one month, April, and then review the situation.\n\nThis is a very rare event that water regulator has started water discharge parameters on a monthly basis, although past precedents are there for water allocations in three parts during a season.\n\nThe meeting noted that because of no storage in any of the three storages, water discharges at rim-stations stood at 51pc shortfall and went beyond 60pc while reaching provincial canal heads.\n\n“The Irsa Advisory Committee (IAC) duly accounting the unclear climatical parameters and keeping in view the summer 2025 weather outlook presented by Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), approved the water availability only for the month of April 25 with 43pc system shortfall,” said an official statement, adding that the water situation would again be reviewed in the first week of May.\n\nThe IAC meeting, which was presided over by Irsa chairman and member from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sahibzada Mohammad Shabbir, was held to approve the Kharif anticipated water availability criteria from April 1 to Sept 30. All Irsa members, chief engineering adviser, provincial irrigation secretaries and senior officials attended the meeting.\n\nThe meeting reviewed the Rabi 2024-25 (Oct-Mar) system operation and showed satisfaction over the overall seasonal close at 18pc shortages till March 20 against the anticipated shortages of 16pc.\n\nThe PMD highlighted that below normal rain and above normal temperatures especially across northern and southern tips of the country were forecasted by local and global climate models for the months of April, May and June, the official statement pointed out, adding that PMD also reported winter snowfall in the catchments of Indus and Jhelum was recorded as 26.8 inches against the normal of 49.7 inches — i.e. 31pc less and inflows into the rim-station rivers would also be less than normal.\n\nBoth Sindh and Punjab agreed to have water allocations only for the month of April to take advantage of its lead demand and then review the situation again. However, Sindh registered its objection to the water distribution under the controversial 3-tier water distribution formula and demanded that water shares should be worked out on para-2 of the Water Accord. In that case, water shortage was estimated to go beyond 55pc for April.\n\nThe Kharif cropping season starts in April and lasts until September. Rice, sugarcane, cotton, maize, and mash are some of the key crops of the season.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 27th, 2025",
