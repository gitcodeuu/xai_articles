  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has said his government was fulfilling its commitment to meet the province’s electricity needs through alternative energy projects.\n\nHe made these remarks while inaugurating home solar systems provided by the Chinese government under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) at a ceremony.\n\nHe noted that these solar systems had been lying in warehouses for months, but the current government ensured their transparent distribution and low-cost installation.\n\nCM Bugti termed it a “significant milestone for the people of Balochistan” as these the systems would help alleviate their hardships.\n\nHe pointed out that Rs350 to 400 million were initially allocated for the project, but due to efficient planning, it was completed at a cost of Rs120-130m, resulting in significant savings.\n\nHighlighting the importance of Gwadar as the “heart of CPEC”, CM Bugti directed the authorities concerned to provide at least 5,000 households in Gwadar with home solar systems.\n\nHe emphasised that the people of Gwadar should directly benefit from CPEC, as their sacrifices played a crucial role in making the project a reality.\n\nHe announced that the Balochistan government was incorporating off-grid power stations into its development budget to ensure electricity supply to areas lacking conventional grid stations.\n\nAs part of this initiative, pilot projects will be launched in Nokundi, Buleda, Sui, Sherani and Mashkel, with plans to expand them to other districts later.\n\nCM Bugti criticised the Quetta Electric Supply Company (Qesco), calling it a “white elephant” due to its poor performance and mismanagement.\n\nHe pointed out that high line losses and rampant corruption within Qesco have exacerbated public grievances.\n\nThe chief minister announced that the Balochistan government, in collaboration with the federal government, has launched a Rs50 billion mega project to shift agricultural tube wells to solar energy.\n\nHowever, he lamented that Qesco’s inefficiency was causing delays in some areas.\n\n“If Qesco does not act swiftly, the provincial government will complete the installation of solar systems for farmers independently,” he said, adding that farmers are eager to switch from Qesco to solar energy.\n\nReiterating his government’s dedication to public welfare projects, CM Bugti assured that more energy initiatives would be introduced for the people of Balochistan.\n\nHe instructed the relevant departments to ensure fair and transparent distribution of solar systems, preventing any interference by ineligible individuals.\n\nThe chief minister appreciated the contributions of Friends of China Forum Chairman Bayazid Khan Kasi for strengthening ties between the Chinese and Balochistan governments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 7th, 2025",
