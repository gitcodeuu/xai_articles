  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A historic World War I memorial in Islamabad is at risk of being demolished to make way for a new housing project.\n\nThe monument, erected by the British Empire after 1914 to honour local soldiers who fought in the Great War, stands on Kuri Road but now faces imminent destruction due to development plans by the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and the Defence Housing Authority (DHA).\n\n“The CDA, in collaboration with DHA, is planning to level a mound in the area as part of a joint project, which threatens the preservation of this historic site,” said an official in the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM).\n\nIslamabad has already witnessed loss of numerous historical and archaeological sites due to rapid urban expansion. Experts from the Department of Archaeology and Museums (DOAM) warn that the continued disregard for cultural heritage in the name of development is erasing significant parts of the city’s history.\n\nIt has been a recurring issue that CDA and other development bodies initiate construction projects without obtaining the necessary No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the Department of Archaeology and Museums. This negligence has led to the destruction of several archaeological sites over the years.\n\nIslamabad is home to ancient artifacts, including two-million-year-old man-made stone tools. A recent survey of the archaeology department identified over 20 archaeological sites within the city, underscoring the need for stronger preservation efforts.\n\nHeritage conservationists and historians are urging authorities to take immediate action to safeguard the World War I memorial and other historically significant landmarks before they are lost to unchecked development.\n\nImages show that land has been levelled all around till the foot of the mound above which the memorial stands. The matter of the immanent destruction of the monument went viral on social media, where concerned citizens have urged people to join protests to stop what they call “unsympathetic” and “insensitive” developers in their tracks.\n\nWhen contacted, the Capital Development Authority spokesman Shahid Kiyani stated that he had no knowledge of the matter.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 7th, 2025",
