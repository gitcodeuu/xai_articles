He will have another ICC trophy soon,” former seam bowler Praveen Kumar told The Times of India.\n\n“I will only say that Virat and Rohit, give us one more ICC trophy before you retire,” he added.\n\nIndia go into the final at Dubai International Cricket Stadium as favourites and with their confidence sky-high.\n\nThey have won all four of their matches at the eight-nation tournament, including beating New Zealand by 44 runs in the group phase, although both teams had already reached the semi-finals by then.\n\nRohit’s side have played all their games in Dubai after refusing to visit Champions Trophy hosts Pakistan because of political tensions.\n\nRohit and Kohli came into the competition under pressure.\n\nMaster batsman Kohli silenced his critics with an unbeaten 100 against arch-rivals Pakistan, then hit a match-winning 84 against world champions Australia in the semi-finals.\n\nRohit’s highest score has been 41 in their opening win over Bangladesh but the opener has been lauded for handing the team quick starts to build totals on at a venue where batting is tough.\n\nIndia, who are looking to win the Champions Trophy for a record third time, also boast a world-class spin attack.\n\nThey unleashed four spinners in beating New Zealand with Varun Chakravarthy returning figures of 5-42 to help bowl out the Black Caps for 205 in their chase of 250.\n\nIndia were unchanged against Australia as the spin-heavy selection came up trumps again, albeit on a Dubai pitch that turned a little less that time around.\n\nIn front of them lies a New Zealand team hoping to win the tournament for the second time, having done so in 2000 in what was the second edition of a competition likened to a mini World Cup.\n\nThe Black Caps powered into the final by beating South Africa by 50 runs in Lahore.\n\nBut the victory came at a price with an injury to pace bowler Matt Henry after he landed on his shoulder awkwardly while taking a catch.\n\nHenry, who took 5-42 against India in the group phase, is in a race to be fit for Sunday.\n\n“Still a little bit unknown at this stage,” head coach Gary Stead said.\n\n“He’s obviously pretty sore just from landing on the point of his shoulder. Hopeful he will be okay.”\n\nBatsman Rachin Ravindra hammered 108 in New Zealand’s Champions Trophy record total of 362 against South Africa at the batting-friendly Gaddafi Stadium.\n\nRavindra put together 164 runs with veteran batsman Kane Williamson, who hit 102.\n\nThe left-handed Ravindra, who also bowls left-arm spin, has amassed 226 from three matches after he returned from a nasty hit to his forehead in a tri-series match in Pakistan.\n\nThe Wellington-born Ravindra is of Indian origin with his parents hailing from Bengaluru.\n\n“We don’t quite know how the Dubai pitch is like,” said Ravindra.\n\n“I think we pride ourselves in adapting and playing the situation in front of us, so will see what happens in the next couple of days and hope it’s a good cricket wicket.”\n\nIndia might be favourites and will have much of the crowd at the 25,000-capacity Dubai stadium roaring them on, but recent history is actually with New Zealand.\n\nThey registered a surprise 3-0 Test whitewash in India in October and November last year.\n\nThe Black Caps also hold a clear advantage over India with nine wins, six losses and one no-result at global white-ball tournaments.",
