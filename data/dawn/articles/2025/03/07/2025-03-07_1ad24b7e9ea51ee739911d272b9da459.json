  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan High Court (BHC) has summoned the attorney general to state the government’s position on a petition challenging recent changes to the cybercrime law.\n\nThe controversial amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) 2016 have resulted in severe criticism by journalists and rights organisations. The law has also been challenged in courts across Pakistan.\n\nThe petition in BHC was filed by the Balochistan Union of Journalists (BUJ), Human Rights Commission and Balochistan Bar Council.\n\nThe BUJ president, Khalil Ahmed and bar council Vice Chairman Rahib Baledi appeared in the court.\n\nA two-judge bench, including Acting Chief Justice Ejaz Ahmed Swati and Justice Amir Rana, held a hearing on Thursday.\n\nThe deputy attorney general requested the court for more time to submit a response.\n\nThe request prompted disapproval from the bench, which ordered the attorney general to appear at the next hearing.\n\nThe hearing was later adjourned for three weeks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 7th, 2025",
