The two had quarrelled in the street in front of neighbours,” he said.\n\nHe said that he had worked with some TV channels in past but now he was occasionally working as a labourer. “Not only this but he had also become an addict of ice,” said the SHO, adding the victim’s family did not allow a post mortem.\n\nAccording to the victim’s friends, Qasim worked with a national-level Urdu Channel six years back and then joined a Sindhi news channel after becoming a victim of downsizing. He quit this job and briefly worked for a social media outlet, which he left after working for about five to six months.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 7th, 2025",
