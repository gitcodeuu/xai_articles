The pack also attacked the livestock of Rehmat Ali in the same area.\n\nThe affected people, along with other residents, decried the administration’s inaction. They said street dogs in Faqirwali and surrounding areas were rising rapidly.\n\nThey said no systematic effort was being made to curb these attacks, leading to an increase in their frequency.\n\nThe victims demanded immediate compensation, either in the form of new livestock or cash equivalent to their losses, to help them sustain their livelihood.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
