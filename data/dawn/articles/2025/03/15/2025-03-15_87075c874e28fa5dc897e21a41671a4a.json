  "content": "BEIJING: China urged an end to “illegal” sanctions against Iran as it hosted Iranian and Russian diplomats on Friday for talks Beijing hopes will restart long-stalled negotiations on Tehran’s nuclear programme.\n\nThe United States withdrew from a landmark 2015 deal, which imposed curbs on Tehran’s nuclear development in return for sanctions relief, during US President Donald Trump’s first term.\n\nThe Republican president has called for a new nuclear deal with Iran since his return to the White House in January, but Tehran says no such agreement is possible so long as punishing sanctions remain in place.\n\nThe effort to secure a pact was given new urgency last month when the UN nuclear watchdog said Iran had significantly increased its stockpile of highly enriched uranium. Beijing hosted Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Kazem Gharibabadi and his Russian counterpart Sergei Ryabkov for talks on Friday, expressing hopes that the initiative would help “resume dialogue and negotiation at an early time”.\n\nChina hosts Iranian and Russian ministers for talks, expressing hopes the move will help resume dialogue on N-plan soon\n\nMeeting the diplomats, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed “the comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear issue is an important achievement achieved through dialogue and negotiation”.\n\n“Now the situation has reached a critical juncture again. We must buy time for peace, resolve disputes through political and diplomatic means, and oppose the use of force and illegal sanctions,” he said.\n\nAnd the US should demonstrate “political sincerity and return to talks at an early date”, said a statement from Beijing’s foreign ministry, which outlined propositions from China on the Iranian nuclear issue.\n\n“All parties should… refrain from actions that might escalate the situation,” the statement added.\n\n‘Peaceful’ nuclear programme Gharibabadi, in turn, hailed the “constructive” talks in Beijing and said Iran’s nuclear programme “is peaceful in nature”.\n\n“Our nuclear programme has never been diverted to non-peaceful purposes,” Gharibabadi said.\n\n“But unfortunately, some countries are trying to create an unnecessary crisis in this regard. “The root cause of the current situation is the unilateral withdrawal of the United States,” Gharibabadi added.\n\nThe Russian and Iranian officials met China’s Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu earlier on Friday and “exchanged views on the Iran nuclear issue and other issues of common concern”, Chinese state media said. Ma reiterated after that meeting China’s support for “political and diplomatic engagement and dialogue based on mutual respect”.\n\n“We emphasised the necessity of ending all illegal, unilateral sanctions,” Ma told reporters. “The relevant parties should work to eliminate the root causes of the current situation and abandon sanctions, pressure, and threats of the use of force.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
