Terming water a very sensitive subject, the incarcerated leader pointed out that it had taken decades to reach consensus over the 1991 Water Accord. He recalled that it was agreed to by all the federating units that water disputes would be resolved at the CCI.\n\nIn open letter from jail, PTI leader assails Bilawal for his ‘confused stance’\n\nAny decision reached without consensus will put strain on the federation, he warned.\n\nMr Qureshi asked how would the deliberations, as proposed by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, take place as the project has already been launched. He wondered whether the federal government would shelve the project till a consensus is reached at the CCI.\n\n“If PM Shehbaz Sharif is not willing to announce that, then how will he satisfy his coalition partner and the people of Sindh, who have raised serious concerns over the canals project,” asked Mr Qureshi.\n\nCalling Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s recent presser at Islamabad confusing, Mr Qureshi said that on the one hand, the PPP chairman had endorsed the Green Pakistan Initiative (GPI), but on the other, he declared opposition to the new canals, which were part of the project.\n\nSimilarly, he said, Mr Bhutto-Zardari had opposed the corporate farming, which according to the GPI would attract investment in the agriculture sector and enable technology transfer for higher productivity.\n\nHe said the PPP leader had floated the idea of collective farming without sharing any details on how it would be implemented on the ground. “This confused and contradictory approach adopted by the coalition partners will not only stall the GPI, but will deepen the controversy further,” he asserted.\n\nUnder the initiative, launched in Punjab’s Cholistan area last month, farmers would be provided with high-quality seeds, fertilisers, modern machinery and scientific support to increase the yield of their crops.\n\nHowever, the project has triggered a controversy with Sindh raising objections to it. The province fears the canals drawing water from Indus will create its shortage for agriculture and human consumption.\n\nNot only the PPP-led provincial government, but almost all sections of society have expressed their opposition to the project.\n\nEver since the project was launched in mid-February, political parties, bar associations, women activists, etc, have held demonstrations against it in various parts of Sindh.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
