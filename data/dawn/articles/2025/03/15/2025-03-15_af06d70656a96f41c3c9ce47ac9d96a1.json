  "content": "KHYBER: A slew of intelligence-based operations and the brutal murder of a leading trader along with his colleague had greatly dampened the resolve of the residents of Tirah valley, particularly traders and transporters, for restoration of lasting peace.\n\nConsidered as an articulate campaigner of peace, Haji Sher Mohammad, president of Tirah traders association, fell victim to his noble desire of eradicating extremism from the valley and restoring peace through development and promotion of trade and tourism.\n\nHe was brutally murdered by the activists of Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) on Feb 4, 2025, after he along with one of his associates, Ibrar Afridi, were abducted by militants on Jan 30 on suspicion of their alleged involvement in the killing of two important TTP commanders during an IBO in Bagh-Maidan area on Jan 25.\n\nResidents in the valley told Dawn on Friday that the three business centres of Lar-Bagh Markaz, Bar-Bagh Markaz and Peer Mela were wearing a deserted look since the brutal murder of Haji Sher Mohammad and Ibrar Afridi.\n\nBusiness centres of Lar-Bagh Markaz, Bar-Bagh Markaz and Peer Mela wear deserted look\n\nThey said that the valley was also in the grip of severe cold due to snowfall on the surrounding mountains and heavy rains since the start of February.\n\nGul Zamin, a valley resident, said that while a majority of the residents were in a state of constant fear due to the presence of armed militants in different parts of the valley, they were also now fed up with the repeated IBO’s as such operations caused inconvenience to them with their mobility restricted.\n\nHe said nights were very frightening as they constantly hear gunshots with drones hovering in the air coupled with sporadic mortar fire.\n\nHe said the flow of visitors, particularly tourists had considerably reduced while the local residents too were avoiding unnecessary travel due to the presence of armed groups and increasing number of security checkposts.\n\nEjaz Afridi, another resident, said that all schools in the valley were still closed while students were also afraid of going to their schools due to insecurity despite the end of their winter holidays on March 1.\n\nHe said that parents too were reluctant to send their children to schools as a number of school children had fallen victim to drone and quadcopter attacks in recent months.\n\nMeanwhile, the Tirah valley residents demanded of the inspector general of police (IGP) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to arrange for one week stay of Khyber DPO in the valley every month as they were finding it difficult to go to Shahkas in Jamrud all the way from Tirah for the redressal of their grievances.\n\nThey said the week-long stay of DPO every monthwould not only ensure an improvement in the law and order situation in the valley but it will also restore confidence of the people of Tirah in Khyber police.\n\nRELEASE DEMANDED: The Fata Loya Jirga (FLJ) on Friday demanded the immediate and unconditional release of Kukikhel elder Malak Naseer Ahmad and rights activists Najeebur Rehman alias Majboor Pashteen.\n\nAddressing a press conference at Bara Press Club, the FLJ chairman said that the two were arrested through a fake FIR on false charges which the authorities were yet to prove as these haD no basis.\n\nHe said their movement for the repeal of the merger of erstwhile Fata with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa could not be subdued with such tactics and they would resist all types of such pressures.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
