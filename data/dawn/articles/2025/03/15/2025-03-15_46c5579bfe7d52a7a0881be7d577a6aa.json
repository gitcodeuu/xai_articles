  "content": "NEW DELHI: England batsman Harry Brook has been banned from the Ind­ian Premier League for two years after he pulled out at the last minute to focus on international cric­ket, local media reported Friday.\n\nThe 26-year-old, considered a frontrunner to repl­ace Jos Buttler as England’s white-ball captain, was signed to Delhi Capitals for the IPL season beginning next week.\n\nBrook also withdrew from his contract with the Delhi side last season after the death of his grandmother.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has been informed about Bro­oks’s ban, an unnamed official from the Board of Control for Cricket in Indian (BCCI) told the Indian Express newspaper.\n\nThe ban was part of a policy “informed to each player before they registered their name for IPL auction last year”, the official said.\n\nThe rules are designed to prevent late pullouts from the league by overseas players. Exceptions can be made, mostly for injuries.\n\nBrook this week apologised on social media “unr­e­s­ervedly to the Delhi Cap­it­als and their supporters” for pulling out of the league “to recharge” and focus on international cricket.\n\nBrook has played one season in the IPL, for Sunr­isers Hyderabad in 2023, when he scored a 55-ball century against Kolkata Knight Riders.\n\nThe IPL begins on March 22 when Kolkata host Royal Challengers Bengaluru at the Eden Gardens.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
