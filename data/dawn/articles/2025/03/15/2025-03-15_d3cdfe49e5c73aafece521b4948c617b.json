  "content": "KARACHI: Lawyers took out a rally on Friday from the Sindh High Court (SHC) to the Karachi Press Club against the construction of six new canals on the Indus River and corporate framing.\n\nMembers of the legal fraternity gathered at the parking lot of the SHC and marched up to the press club. Chanting slogans against what they termed anti-Sindh projects, they were carrying placards and banners inscribed with their demands.\n\nSindh High Court Bar Association President Sarfaraz Ali Metlo, Abdul Wahab Baloch and other senior lawyers also participated in the gathering.\n\nAddressing the participants outside the KPC, they criticised the federal authorities concerned, including the Indus River System Authority (Irsa), for issuing water availability certificate for the controversial canals’ project in Cholistan despite opposition of Sindh.\n\nThey urged the federal government to immediately withdraw those schemes in the interest of the federation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
