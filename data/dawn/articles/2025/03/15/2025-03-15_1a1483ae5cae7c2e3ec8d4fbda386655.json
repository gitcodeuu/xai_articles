But relations later “seemed to go a little bit off the rails”, he said.\n\nIn his X post, Rubio linked to an article from the conservative news outlet Breitbart, which addressed Rasool’s remarks via livestream to a foreign policy seminar on Friday.\n\n“He said that white supremacism was motivating Trump’s ‘disrespect’ for the ‘current hegemonic order’ of the world,” Breitbart reported, adding that Rasool noted that Trump’s ‘Make America Great Again’ movement “was a white supremacist response to growing demographic diversity in the United States”.\n\nRasool, an anti-apartheid campaigner in his youth, has expressed anger toward the Israeli government for its military campaign in Gaza. In February, in an interview with news site Zeteo, he said what South Africans experienced during apartheid rule “is on steroids in Palestine”.",
