So many people sacrificed their lives in vain.”\n\nEx-premier Sheikh Hasina, ousted in last August’s revolution, took a tough stance against religious movements during her 15-year tenure. Her government was blamed for gruesome human rights abuses, and for many, her departure heralded change.\n\nSince her exit, the hardline religiously fuelled activism that Hasina’s government had driven underground has resurfaced. Much of it is directed at Bangladeshi women, accused of failing to act with sufficient modesty.\n\nArnab, who works at the library of the prestigious Dhaka University, was accused of accosting a student on campus, saying that her choice of attire did not sufficiently cover her breasts.\n\nThe student complained, and Arnab was arrested. Supporters of Arnab, who believed he had acted in appropriate deference to his religious convictions, surrounded the police station and demanded his release.\n\nThey yielded when a court quickly bailed Arnab — something the female student attributed to mob pressure.\n\nA spokesperson for Dhaka’s police force, Md Talebur Rahman, told AFP that Arnab was still under investigation and also acknowledged the menacing behaviour his victim had faced.\n\n“She can lodge a complaint against those who have been threatening her,” Rahman added.\n\nIt is far from an isolated incident.\n\nSeveral women’s football matches were cancelled this year after pitch invasions by hardliners angry at women’s participation in sport. Two women were briefly taken into protective custody by police this month after an altercation that began when they were harassed for publicly smoking cigarettes by a crowd of men on their way to pray at a mosque.\n\nHardline groups have also demanded that organisers of religious commemorations and other public events remove women from the line-up.\n\nDhaka University student Jannatul Promi, 23, said that the rising incidences of harassment had left young women feeling unsafe.\n\n“We are going through a crisis,” she said. “The other day, I was waiting for the metro when a man approached me and asked if I should be outside without a veil. As soon as I responded, more people joined him against me.”\n\nFellow student Nishat Tanjim Nera, aged 24, said the authorities had failed in their duty.\n\n“Harassment incidents are happening repeatedly, but there is no redress from the government,” she said.\n\nSeveral recent cases of sexual violence have captured public attention.\n\nAn eight-year-old girl died on Thursday from wounds she sustained during a rape days earlier — a case that prompted days of protests and vigils by women in Dhaka and elsewhere.\n\nSuch is the level of public anger that police have begun transporting rape suspects to court in the middle of the night, out of fear of attacks.\n\nNobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus, who leads the interim government which replaced Hasina, condemned the “horrific acts of violence” against women.\n\n“This is deeply concerning and completely at odds with our dream of building a new Bangladesh,” he said.\n\nYunus’s administration has struggled to restore law and order, with many police officers refusing to return to work and the army brought in to help.\n\nSince last month, it has directed scant police resources to a sweeping crackdown, dubbed Operation Devil Hunt, against gangs allegedly connected to Hasina and working to foment unrest.\n\nMaleka Banu, of the feminist campaign group Bangladesh Mahila Parishad, said those resources would have been better spent on trying to curb sexual violence.\n\n“What good is it for the government to simply express concern? We expected action,” she said.\n\n“After Sheikh Hasina’s fall, a series of violent incidents followed. The government was in complete denial […] Now, they claim the fallen dictator is behind every crime.”",
