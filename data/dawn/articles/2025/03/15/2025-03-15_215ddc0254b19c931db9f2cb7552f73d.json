The Balochistan Lib­e­ration Army claimed that the attack was carried out by its Majeed Brigade,” said the statement, issued by Council President Christina Markus Lassen.\n\nThe members of the Security Council expressed their deepest sympathy and condolences to the families of the victims and to the government and the people of Pakistan, and they wished a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured.\n\n“The members of the Security Council reaffirmed that terrorism in all its forms and manifestations constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security,” it said.\n\nThe members of the Security Council underlined the need to hold perpetrators, organisers, financiers and sponsors of these reprehensible acts of terrorism accountable and bring them to justice.\n\nThey urged all states, in accordance with their obligations under international law and relevant Security Council resolutions, to cooperate actively with the government of Pakistan in this regard.\n\nThe members of the Security Council reiterated that any acts of terrorism are criminal and unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed.\n\nThey reaffirmed the need for all states to combat by all means, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and other obligations under international law, including human rights law, refugee law and humanitarian law, threats to international peace and security caused by terrorist acts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
