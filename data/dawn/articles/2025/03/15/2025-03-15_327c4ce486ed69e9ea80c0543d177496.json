  "content": "ISLAMABAD: TheNetwork for Consumer Protection has strongly criticised the government’s decision to discourage solarisation by reducing the electricity buyback rate by one third to Rs10 per unit and scrapping net billing.\n\nTheNetwork has called the move a bad gift on the eve of World Consumer Rights Day, being observed on Saturday, focusing on the theme of a “Just Transition to Sustainable Lifestyles”.\n\nThe decision, applicable to new net-metering consumers, was taken at a meeting of ECC says that the power companies will purchase surplus solar electricity from consumers at Rs10 per unit during the day, while selling grid electricity at Rs42 per unit (off-peak) and Rs48 per unit (peak) after sunset, excluding taxes and duties.\n\nTheNetwork CEO, Nadeem Iqbal says, “A Just Transition” should not come at the expense of consumers but should empower them with fair pricing, accessible clean energy, and strong regulatory support. As World Consumer Rights Day highlights the importance of sustainable lifestyles, policymakers must ensure that energy policies are align with consumer interests rather than creating barriers to renewable energy adoption.“\n\n“According to the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), by the end of fiscal year 2023-24, Pakistan’s installed electric power generation capacity reached 45,888MW, but the actual annual utilisation was only 33.88 per cent. This means consumers were forced to pay for 66.12 per cent of unutilized capacity, an unjust burden that worsens energy affordability.\n\n“Instead of rewarding inefficiencies, we must prioritise consumer-centric energy policies that ensure affordability, accessibility, and accountability,” Nadeem demands.\n\nTheNetwork is a council member of the Consumer International (CI), an umbrella organisation of over 200 organisations in more than 100 countries.\n\nConsumers’ groups world over call for a just transition to sustainable lifestyles that upholds the legitimate needs of consumers. This includes access to essential needs such as food and energy and the protection of people’s health and safety.\n\nOver 80 per cent of consumers worldwide hold governments, businesses, and international institutions responsible for implementing necessary changes, while 88 per cent believe large corporations should encourage governments to take stronger climate action.\n\nThe impact of the climate crisis is already being felt globally. Pollution causes at least 9 million premature deaths annually. By 2030, climate change is expected to cause an additional 250,000 deaths per year due to undernutrition, malaria, diarrhea, and heat stress.\n\nA three-degree temperature rise could expose 600 million people to flooding. Heat stress is projected to reduce total working hours globally by 2.2 per cent and shrink global GDP by $2.4 trillion in 2030.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
