The initiative aims to connect jobseekers with potential employers, fostering a partnership between the government and the private sector.\n\nHe welcomed the government’s economic measures, stressing that economic stability requires both inflation control and increased production.\n\nHe reiterated PPP’s commitment to providing employment opportunities, particularly through collaboration with the private sector.\n\n“Sindh government is playing its role in job creation, but the private sector must also step forward to benefit from the province’s talent,” he emphasised.\n\nChief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah in his address said the government had provided jobs through four different streams, and this portal wou­ld serve as a bridge between the job seekers and employers.\n\nHe announced that the provincial government would advertise its job openings on the platform, ensuring a fair and merit-based recruitment process.\n\nMr Shah revealed that the Sindh Public Service Com­mission and IBA Sukkur’s job listings would also be integrated into the portal.\n\n“This initiative will bring transparency to the hiring system, making job opportunities more accessible to the youth,” he added.\n\nThe CM also invited private sector companies to utilise the portal for their hiring needs. “Employers from the private sector should list their vacancies here to expand job opportunities,” he urged.\n\nSenior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that 65 per cent of Pakistan’s population consists of youth, which was why the Sindh government had introduced the jobs portal. He said that both educated and skilled individuals through this app would be able to upload their CVs and find jobs matching their abilities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
