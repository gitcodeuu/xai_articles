  "content": "KARACHI: Through a unanimous resolution, the Sindh Assembly on Friday vehemently condemned the terrorists’ attack on a passenger train in Balochistan and paid rich tributes to the armed forces for their swift rescue operation.\n\nLawmakers from both sides of the aisle, except for the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI)-backed Sunni Ittehad Council, spoke on the resolution tabled by Chief Minister (CM) Syed Murad Ali Shah.\n\nThe resolution said: “This House strongly condemns the terrorist attack on the Jaffar Express and recognises the heinous terrorist attack as a grave act of violence that seeks to undermine peace and instill fear among the citizens of Pakistan.”\n\nThe House through the resolution also paid rich tributes to the armed forces and law enforcement agencies for their prompt and effective action responding to the incident, preventing further loss of life and bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n\nThe CM said that a few days ago, terrorists attacked the Jaffar Express in Balochistan. “This cowardly act is highly condemnable. We pay tribute to our brave Pakistan Army, which rescued all the hostages safely from the terrorists,” he added.\n\nMr Shah said the law enforcement agencies carried out the operation very quickly and killed all the terrorists. “We congratulate the Balochistan government and the Pakistan Army on this success,” he added.\n\nFully supporting the resolution, Opposition Leader Ali Khurshidi paid glowing tribute to the Pakistan Army. “I salute the paramilitary forces,” he added.\n\nHe also underlined the need to revisit the National Action Plan. “Be it the Parachinar incident or other such incidents, we need to unite to prevent all of them. However, for some people, their leader comes first, not Pakistan.”\n\nSenior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon stated that incidents like that of Jaffar Express did not occur randomly; it had underlying motives behind them.\n\nHe said the people of Balochistan had a sense of deprivation as injustices had been committed against them in the past.\n\nHe emphasised that the land of Balochistan was rich in natural resources and if peace and stability were restored, it could become a self-sufficient province.\n\nHowever, he said the situation in Balochistan had been deliberately deteriorated, and certain forces did not want the region to progress.\n\nSpeaking about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he stated that its founder was Asif Ali Zardari, who transformed Gwadar into an international port. “However, some forces are fearful of Pakistan’s progress and are exploiting the local people for their vested interests,” he added.\n\nThe senior minister also stated that enemy nations of Pakistan, in collaboration with certain neighboring states, were inciting conflict among people.\n\nHe praised the security forces for their operations against terrorists, saluting the brave personnel who got freed the hostages of the Jaffar Express and eliminated the terrorists.\n\nThe minister urged those who truly support the country to lay down their arms and engage in dialogue. He stressed that everyone must work together to find a solution to that issue as those receiving foreign funding to harm their own country were, in reality, its enemies.\n\nJamaat-i-Islami’s Muhammad Farooq said the patriotic youth in Balochistan had been misled by the enemies of the country.\n\nHe said the militants in the province should not be dealt with iron hand, but should be treated politely. “They should be given their due rights. They should be befriended,” he emphasised.\n\nThe Jamaat MPA stressed the need of meaningful dialogue among all stakeholders to resolve the issue of terrorism in Balochistan.\n\nSupporting the resolution, PPP’ Nadir Magsi said the entire House condemned the terrorism in Balochistan. “The incident of Jaffar Express is regrettable. Our prayers are with the martyred soldiers,” he said, adding that terrorism had taken roots in the country.\n\nMr Magsi said the problem of terrorism would not be solved by the force of gun. “This problem will be solved by talks. Both sides should think about this,” he advised.\n\nLocal Government Minister Saeed Ghani has said that terrorism is the biggest challenge in the country at the moment. “The soldiers and military officers who fight terrorists are the heroes of this entire nation,” he added.\n\nMuttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s Muhammad Mazahir said the Pakistan Army played a great role in that crisis. “Some people criticised the Pakistan Army for political point scoring, which is regrettable,” he said and added: “We are in a peaceful environment because of our security agencies.”\n\nHe said the attackers had given a dangerous message to the law enforcers and people by carrying out a well-planned terrorist activity in Balochistan. “There are 17 tunnels on the rail track from Balochitan to Peshawar and the terrorists chose Tunnel No. 8 situated in a desolate area where there was no mobile network,” he added.\n\nHome Minister Zia Lanjar condemned the terrorist act and said that lies were presented as truth on social media, so much so that even the truth became a shame.\n\nHe said that it was an open secret that the terrorists got support from neighbouring countries.\n\nHe said the train had been attacked as result of a well-planned conspiracy. “However, the law enforcement agencies handled the situation in time,” he added.\n\nPPP’s Sardar Khan Chandio, Imdad Pitafi, Sardar Muhammad Bux, Makhdoom Fakhar Zaman and Taimur Talpur, and MQM-P’s Quratul Ain Khan, Taha ahmed and Wasimuddin also spoke on the occasion.\n\nLater, the House was adjourned to Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
