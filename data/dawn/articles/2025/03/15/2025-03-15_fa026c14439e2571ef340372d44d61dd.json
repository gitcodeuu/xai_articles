  "content": "LAHORE: While awaiting international funding for the ML-1 main line, originally part of CPEC, for nearly a decade, the Minister for Railways has said the government may use own resources for the project in case no one partners with them.\n\n“When we talk about ML-1, our hearts have become numb listening this project again and again. Therefore, the Prime Minister has decided to construct ML-1 project. And if no one partners us for this project, we will make it with our own money,” newly appointed Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi said while talking to the media at Lahore railway station on Friday night.\n\nMr Abbasi’s statement has come at a time when the government in general and the ministry of railways in particular is expecting a long-awaited visit of the high-powered technical team from China by the end of March.\n\nBoth China and Pakistan had renewed commitment in October 2024 to advancing the upgrade of the ML-1 under CPEC, agreeing to prioritise the construction of the Karachi-Hyderabad section as part of phase-1, in line with the phased approach for the project’s implementation.\n\nMinister says repairs of dilapidated tracks will take time\n\nAbout the delay in the project, the federal minister said he would tell the nation through media when this project would be signed.\n\n“I would tell you honestly when this project would be signed. And I would defend whatever I will tell you in this regard,” he added.\n\n“We also plan to outsource some services (including cleanliness) at Lahore Railway Station in a bid to improve our services,” Mr Abbasi said, explaining that he could not get the dilapidated railway track fixed immediately as it would take time.\n\n“But we will not tolerate the issues related to punctuality. Therefore, the respective divisional superintendent would have to reply in case of delay in arrival/departure of any train,” he warned.\n\nHe admitted the fact of theft, smuggling and other sorts of corruption in railways and pledged to plug it by all means.\n\nTrain tragedy\n\nTalking about the Jaffar Express tragedy in Balochistan, Mr Abbasi said some countries, especially India and Afghanistan, wanted to destabilise Pakistan like Syria, Libya and Iraq, but as the nation stands with Pakistan Army, no one can dare to do this.\n\n“We will eliminate our enemies, as we all are standing with our armed forces,” he said.\n\nWhile responding to various questions on the incident, the minister disclosed that a total of 427 passengers were travelling in the train. Among them, there were as many as eight suicide bombers, while 60 terrorists were standing in and outside the train.\n\nThe total number of the martyred is 68 that included 33 terrorists, 52 were injured by the terrorists while the forces safely rescued a total of 327 people.\n\nThough the martyrdom of many people was a great loss, rescuing a huge number of people by killing 33 terrorists amid no blast from suicide bombers is “a tremendous achievement”, he asserted.\n\nAbout the affected track in Balochistan, he said it would be cleared by Saturday night.\n\nThe minister said the government decided to chase the enemies hiding wherever in the world, as both Afghanistan and India were behind the renewed wave of terrorism in Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 15th, 2025",
