  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Tuesday wondered how the founding chairman of PTI takes decisions related to the party’s policy.\n\nQuestions over the party’s internal affairs were raised when a three-member bench of ECP, headed by Sindh Member Nisar Ahmad Durrani, took up for hearing the case related to PTI’s intra-party elections.\n\nPTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, petitioner Akbar S. Babar and others appeared before the bench.\n\nDuring the course of the hearing, the ECP member from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa questioned how the founding chairman often made decisions about the party and announced them through the media.\n\nBarrister Gohar says matters will be streamlined when ECP issues certificate\n\n“Is there any mention of the founding chairman and his role in the party constitution? If not, then how does he make decisions,” he asked.\n\nThe ECP member noted that the name of Salman Akram Raja repeatedly comes up in media and asked what his position was in the party.\n\n“PTI intra-party elections are controversial,” he remarked.\n\nBarrister Gohar said matters were being run by indoor management only, and when the ECP issues the certificate, the matters will be streamlined accordingly.\n\nEarlier, PTI’s founding member and former information secretary Akbar S. Babar pointed out that there exists an organisational structure of the party. How the party funds were being managed was an illegal practice, he claimed.\n\nHe also reminded the bench that the ECP had submitted in writing to the Supreme Court in relation to the petition concerning the reserved seats that the party’s organisational structure was illegal.\n\nAbout Mr Babar’s point of running PTI’s financial matters, the bench noted that the matter would be dealt with at a separate hearing.\n\nMr Babar urged the bench to allow arguments and then reserve verdict in the case.\n\nHowever, the bench emphasised that in the presence of a restraining order from the Lahore High Court, they could not announce a decision but reserve it and hear arguments only.\n\nHe contended that he comes fully prepared to the proceedings to answer questions.\n\nHowever, the bench maintained that they would like to wait a bit more and resume the hearing on April 8.\n\nLater, while talking to reporters, Barrister Gohar regretted that despite holding intra-party elections a year ago, PTI has not been issued a certificate.\n\nHe said the ECP has “failed to fulfil its constitutional responsibility”.\n\nThe commission should issue a notification to them about the intra-party polls.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 5th, 2025",
