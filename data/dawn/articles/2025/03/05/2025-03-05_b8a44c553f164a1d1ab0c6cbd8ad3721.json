  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Governor Jafar Khan Man­­d­­­okhail has anno­u­nced the establishment of a modern IT park in Quetta which would be a “hub for technological innovation and progress”.\n\nHe said the digital revolution has ushered in a new era of rapid transformation, reshaping human behavior and perspectives. However, limited reso­urces and numerous challenges demand a comprehensive strategy to avoid a looming crisis.\n\nSpeaking during a briefing by Raheel Jamil, the CEO of Radis Group, the governor said that timely and strategic planning is essential to securing a stable future.\n\nHe highlighted the province’s progress in higher education, noting that Balochistan’s 11 public sector universities currently host hundreds of international PhD scholars, researchers, and academic experts. Utilising their expertise, he said, can pave the way for a brighter and more secure future.\n\nGovernor Mandokhail further remarked that as the world advances into the age of Artificial Intelligence and robotics, intellectual capability is increasingly surpassing physical strength.\n\nThis rapidly evolving landscape is set to render traditional mindsets and outdated approaches obsolete.\n\nHe pointed out that the nation faces two major chall­e­nges: embracing inno­v­ation and discarding outdated traditions. How­ever, through mutual under­standing, public-friendly policies, and strategic planning, the province can overcome these challenges and ensure progress in the digital age.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 5th, 2025",
