Militants fired RPGs and grenades during the attack; additional troops and SSG commandoes have been rushed to the area,” the statement added.\n\nSources also confirmed the number of deceased and wounded, including 10 security men. The wou­nded were evacuated to the DHQ and KGN hospi­tals in Bannu, while the injured troops were moved to the CMH.\n\nSix militants were killed by security forces on various entry points of the cantonment, sources said, adding that the rest of the attackers had been encircled by the security forces.\n\nAccording to a source, the Jaish-i-Fursan Muha­m­mad, a faction of the outlawed Hafiz Gul Bahadur group, claimed res­ponsibility for the att­ack on social media. How­ever, the claim could not be independently verified.\n\nSeveral houses collapse\n\nDue to the intensity of explosions, the roofs and walls of several houses in the vicinity collapsed, burying over a dozen people under the rubble. A mosque adjacent to the entrance of the cantonment also caved in and several worshippers were reportedly trapped beneath the debris. Rescue efforts were underway to retrieve them from the rubble.\n\nA rescue official said that the medical teams along with ambulances were dispatched to the area to launch a rescue operation. “People are trapped under the debris of the destroyed houses and a mosque and the rescuers are trying to pull them out,” he added.\n\nA district administration official said that the total number of casualties could not be confirmed yet, as nine dead and 22 injured had been reported from hospitals so far. They said that emergency had been declared in all hospitals, and doctors and paramedics had been called out on duty.\n\nThe Pakistan Army’s media wing, the Inter-Services Public Relations, had not issued an official statement by the time this report went to press.\n\nBannu has witnessed several militant attacks over the past several months.\n\nLast year, on October 14, five militants wearing burqas and suicide vests were killed as four police officials embraced martyrdom in an attempt to foil a gun and bomb attack on Iqbal Shaheed Police Lines. On November 20 last year, 12 troops were martyred in a suicide attack on a security check post in the Mali Khel area of the district. On February 8, this year, two policemen were martyred when terrorists attacked a police post in the Fatehkhel area of the district.\n\nPM expresses sorrow\n\nIn a statement, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif paid tribute to security forces and expressed sorrow and grief over the martyrdom of innocent civilians in the incident. He prayed for the highest ranks of the martyrs and patience for their families and the speedy recovery of those injured in the incident.\n\n“Cowardly terrorists who target innocent civilians in the holy month of Ramazan do not deserve any concessions,” the premier said. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan is the enemy of Pakistan and its evil intentions would never be allowed to succeed.\n\nIn a separate statement, KP government spokesperson Barrister Saif said all attackers had been killed by the security forces. “The roof of a nearby mosque collapsed as a result of the explosions, causing the martyrdom of worshippers,” he said, adding that the total number of the slain was being determined.\n\nHe said Khyber Pakh­tun­khwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur had issued instructions for an inquiry into the incident, adding that the provincial government shared the grief of the families and the martyrs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 5th, 2025",
