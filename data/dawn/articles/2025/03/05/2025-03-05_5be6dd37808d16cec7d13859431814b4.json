By defeating Australia in the first semi-final on Tuesday, India did just that.\n\nIndia have played all their games, including the Australia clash, in Dubai after refusing to visit neighbouring Pakistan because of political tensions.\n\nThe final will also be at Dubai International Cricket Stadium.\n\nPakistan only agreed to the so-called hybrid model of hosting on the condition that they will also not send their team to India for upcoming ICC events.\n\nThe arrangement, which saw other teams shuttle in and out of the UAE while India stayed put, underlined India’s outsized influence over cricket.\n\n“We accepted this arrangement, so what is the fuss?” asked Abdul Samad, a cricket fan.\n\n“When you do not have power, you have to bow down and this is the bargain Pakistan had to do.\n\n“No regrets for me. Our team and our cricket is lagging behind so we had to make a compromise.”\n\nOthers in Pakistan are not so pragmatic.\n\n“No final in Pakistan after such a heavy investment on the venues is a blow,” former captain Rashid Latif told AFP.\n\n“Pakistan is at the lowest level in terms of finances and team-wise as well, which is a double loss.”\n\nPakistan reportedly spent the equivalent of $16 million to upgrade the three venues in Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi. The country will reportedly get $6m in hosting fees from the ICC.\n\nBut finances could be hit with the lack of interest in the 50-over tournament after the home team’s early exit.\n\nThree of the matches in Pakistan were hit by bad weather and empty seats at games were noticeable.\n\n“India have improved enormously and that has been evident in this event,” said Latif, reflecting on what has happened on the pitch.\n\n“But I think politics has lowered the cricket a great deal.”\n\nHe added: “I think had they come to Pakistan and lifted the trophy in Lahore it would have been great.”\n\nLatif says the repercussions of the split hosting will last beyond the Champions Trophy.\n\n“This problem of one team not coming to another country and in future Pakistan not going to India will hit world cricket badly,” he said. “It needs to be addressed quickly. “\n\nHeader image: A person rides on a motorbike past a wall with a billboard advertisement ahead of the ICC Champions Trophy 2025 tournament, in Karachi on Feb 13, 2025. — Reuters/Akhtar Soomro/File",
