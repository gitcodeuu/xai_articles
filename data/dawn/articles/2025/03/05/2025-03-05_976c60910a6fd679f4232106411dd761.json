Does Europe have access to the necessary raw materials? What will happen to inflation when such sums are pumped into the economy?” he asked.\n\nThere is also the question of coordination with other EU states and with Brussels, where EU chief Ursula von der Leyen also presented a plan on Tuesday to mobilise some 800bn euros for Europe’s defence and support for Ukraine.\n\n“I do think there’s a potential for conflict, particularly with Paris,” Ross said.\n\nHe recalled the reaction to the 100bn special fund announced by Scholz in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which was quickly used up.\n\n“Back then [French President] Macron was caught unawares and warned that Germany could be ‘isolating’ itself,” Ross said.\n\n“Now we’re talking about more than twice the amount of money and naturally, European partners will ask what this will mean for their own economies, for the Eurozone and for the balance of power in Europe. “",
