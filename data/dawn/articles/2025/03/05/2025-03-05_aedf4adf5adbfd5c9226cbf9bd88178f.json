  "content": "Donald Trump declared “America is back” on Tuesday in his first address to Congress since returning to power, touting his radical policies in the face of raucous Democratic hostility while proclaiming a breakthrough on Ukraine.\n\nIn the longest presidential speech to lawmakers on record, the Republican repeatedly hailed billionaire advisor Elon Musk’s controversial assault on the federal bureaucracy and said his administration was “just getting started”.\n\n“The American Dream is unstoppable,” said Trump in a speech lasting over one hour and 40 minutes, which beat Bill Clinton’s record for his State of the Union speech in 2000.\n\nAlmost every line got loud applause from Republican Party members, including on two occasions when Trump singled out SpaceX and Tesla tycoon Musk, who stood up to salute Congress.\n\nBut protests also began within minutes.\n\nOne Democratic congressman, Al Green, was ejected because he refused to stop heckling Trump over healthcare programmes, and shaking his walking stick at the president.\n\nOther Democrats silently held up placards including “False” and “Musk steals” and “That’s a lie!” And at one moment, numerous Democrats yelled “January 6!” at Trump, referring to his supporters’ violent attack on the Capitol in 2021 after he refused to concede his election loss.\n\nThe 78-year-old president was undeterred, hailing his first six weeks and vowing to press on with his polarising bid to reshape the US government and end the Ukraine war — whatever the cost.\n\nTrump reverted to his tried-and-tested reality TV instincts. At one point he called attention to a boy with brain cancer who — in front of Congress — was handed an official ID by the head of the Secret Service.\n\nBut in what mostly sounded like a campaign speech rather than an address to the nation, Trump made no attempt to reach out to opponents and at times mocked them.\n\nTo cheers of “USA” and “Trump, Trump, Trump”, he proclaimed that his culture war on diversity programmes and transgender rights meant “our country will be woke no longer”.\n\nHe claimed that he was trying to resolve an “economic catastrophe”, despite inheriting the strongest developed economy in the world from his Democratic predecessor Joe Biden.\n\nHe defended his disruptive economic moves — even as the trade war he launched against Canada, China and Mexico is prompting jitters on world markets.\n\n“We have been ripped off for decades by nearly every country on earth,” Trump said.\n\nAfter a torrent of warnings that tariffs will badly hurt US exporters, including politically powerful farmers, he conceded they would bring “a little disturbance”.\n\nAnd after enumerating a series of murders committed by migrants, Trump got big applause when he vowed to “wage war” on Mexican drug cartels.\n\nWell before he had finished, dozens of Democrats had already walked out.\n\nTrump is pushing to extend presidential power to its limits, with the popular vote behind him and a Republican-controlled House and Senate doing his bidding.\n\nAided by Musk, Trump has cracked down on the federal bureaucracy, firing thousands of workers, shuttering entire agencies and decimating foreign aid.\n\n“The days of rule by unelected bureaucrats are over,” Trump said. But there are early signs in the polls that Trump’s sweeping cuts and his failure to tackle inflation are hitting his popularity.\n\nTrump is also upending US foreign policy with his pivot to Moscow over the Ukraine war, which has stunned Kyiv and allies alike.\n\nDays after a televised row in the Oval Office with Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump said Ukraine’s leader had told him he was now ready for talks with Russia and a US minerals deal.\n\n“I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. The letter reads (that) Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer,” Trump said.\n\nTrump also doubled down on his controversial vows on “taking back” the Panama Canal and getting Greenland from Denmark by “one way or another”. Democrats have so far struggled to counter Trump’s flood-the-zone strategy and his hogging of the news cycle with constant press conferences.\n\nOn the Democrats’ rebuttal speech, Senator Elissa Slotkin aimed her sober address at middleclass Americans, calling Trump and Musk “reckless” at home and giving up on “American leadership” abroad.",
