  "content": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: The Wana-Gomal Zam Road, a vital trade route in Lower South Waziristan, has become a major source of distress for travellers, transporters and traders due to its deteriorating condition.\n\nThe road, riddled with deep potholes, thick mud, broken and unpaved patches, has become almost impassable, especially after the recent spell of continuous rainfall. Additionally, landslides triggered by the rain have further disrupted traffic flow, leaving commuters stranded for hours.\n\nFor the past three consecutive days, heavy rainfall has rendered the Wana-Gomal Zam Road completely unusable for vehicles, severely affecting transportation and trade activities.\n\nThe worsening condition of the road has made travel risky, forcing many drivers to abandon their journeys.\n\nSay recent rains made artery ‘impassable’ for vehicles\n\nThis crucial highway connects Wana to Gomal Zam and serves as a primary route for Pak-Afghan trade via the Angoor Adda border. According to reports thousands of small and heavy vehicles, including trucks, use this route daily. However, due to the deplorable state of the road, passengers are forced to endure long delays, while heavy transport vehicles struggle to navigate through debris, potholes, and landslide-affected areas.\n\nLocal Wazir tribal elders on Tuesday said that they had repeatedly lodged complaints with the civil administration and the communication & works department, but no action was taken to rehabilitate the road. The elders expressed frustration with the federal and provincial governments’ inaction, stating that poor policies and negligence had caused daily suffering for thousands of commuters and traders.\n\nAccording to Wazir elders, this road is not only essential for the local population but also plays a critical role in facilitating trade between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n\nThey recalled that the previous Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had approved billions of rupees for the road’s reconstruction, but the current PTI-led provincial administration removed the project from the development programme, halting any progress on its repair.\n\nAshfaq Wazir, provincial leader of Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party, has made an urgent appeal to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the army chief to intervene and ensure the immediate reconstruction of the Wana-Gomal Zam Road.\n\nHe emphasised that restoring this critical highway was vital for resuming trade activities and alleviating the suffering of daily commuters.\n\nHe further urged the federal government to approve funds for the road’s rehabilitation, stating that immediate action was necessary to resolve the transportation crisis affecting South Waziristan.\n\nThe Wazir tribal elders and political leaders called upon the federal and provincial governments to treat this matter as a top priority and ensure the timely restoration of the road to facilitate trade and transportation in the area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 5th, 2025",
