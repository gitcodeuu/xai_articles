  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Judicial Magistrate Shahzad Gon­dal’s court has rejected the post-arrest bail applicati­o­­ns of 22 PTI workers detai­ned in connection with the protest held on Nov 26.\n\nThe court announced the verdict on Tuesday after it had been reserved a day earlier following the completion of arguments from both sides. The arrested PTI workers remain in jail on judicial remand.\n\nA case was registered against the party workers with the Ramna Police Station for their alleged involvement in the protest.\n\nMeanwhile, the Isla­m­abad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday disposed of a pe­­tition seeking contempt of court proceedings against the superintendent of Adiala Jail for not complying with the orders for arranging meetings of former prime minister Imran Khan with his wife.\n\nAd­­vocate Faisal Chaudhry re­­­presented Mr Khan, while Adiala Jail Super­in­ten­d­ent Abdul Ghafoor An­­­jum appeared before the court.\n\nThe court asked him whether its ord­ers regarding the meetings were being implemented. He assured the court that the directives were being fully followed.\n\nHe said that although the jail rules do not explicitly mention such meetings, the PTI leader and Bushra Bibi have been meeting every Tuesday.\n\nActing IHC Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar assured Mr Chaudhry that the court was overseeing the matter and, after confirming compliance with the court orders, disposed of the petition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 5th, 2025",
