  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government has proposed to the Tajikistan government a virtual meeting of the Pakistan-Tajikistan Joint Working Group on Agriculture next month to explore collaboration between the two countries in the food and agriculture sectors.\n\nThe Ministry of National Food Security and Research has forwarded the proposal to hold the meeting virtually to the Tajikistan government through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nTajikistan has expressed interest in importing sugar and other agricultural products from Pakistan, and these issues will be discussed during the proposed joint working group’s meeting to enhance trade between the two countries.\n\nDuring the sixth session of the Pak-Tajik Joint Ministerial Commission held in July 2019, the two countries agreed to form a joint working group on agriculture. Pakistan proposed a meeting of the JWG to be held in September 2024, but no response was received from the Tajik side. The food ministry has again proposed dates for April this year.\n\nAmbassador of Tajikistan to Pakistan Yusuf Sharifzoda met with Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain in Islamabad on Tuesday to discuss bilateral trade relations between the two countries.\n\nDuring the meeting, Mr Hussain emphasised the need to strengthen trade relations between the two countries.\n\nAmb Sharifzoda expressed his country’s interest in utilising services at Gwadar and Karachi ports for exports and requested the resolution of logistical challenges. Mr Hussain, in response, assured the Tajikistan government of full cooperation in addressing the issues faced by the country.\n\nDuring the state visit of Tajik President Emomali to Pakistan in July last year, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif informed the Tajik president about the operationalisation of Gwadar seaport and offered Tajikistan the opportunity to avail the facilities of Pakistani seaports.\n\nThe meeting also covered Tajikistan’s keen interest in importing various Pakis­tani products. The Tajik side suggested organising a trade exhibition to explore new business opportunities. Additionally, Mr Hussain discussed the Free Trade Agreement and sugar exports to Tajikis­tan. The two countries signed the agreement on transit trade in December 2022.\n\nThere is significant potential for collaboration between Pakistan and Tajikistan in trade, energy, infrastructure and agriculture, though bilateral trade remained modest at $23.46 million in 2022-2023.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 5th, 2025",
