The fire continued to burn into the night and was still not extinguished by 9:50pm on Saturday.\n\nKarachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab said there was no loss of life or infrastructure.\n\n“Since the last 20 hours, we have managed to contain the fire in the 100-metre radius,” he said, adding that the gas source was being ascertained.\n\nThe mayor said petroleum exploration experts had advised that the fire should be contained instead of extinguishing it. “No need to panic,” he added.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by a spokesperson for the Korangi police, the fire broke out while drilling for groundwater in Korangi Creek.\n\nSenior Superintendent of Police Korangi Tariq Nawaz along with Superintendent of Police Landhi and Zaman Town Station House Officer (SHO) Ghulam Nabi Afridi are present at scene.\n\nThe statement added that the intensity of the fire is gradually increasing, due to which the SHOs of all nearby police stations in Korangi district have been called to the scene along with additional personnel.\n\nThe cause of the fire is being investigated. The teams of the Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC) are also present there.\n\nThe SSP Korangi is personally supervising the fire extinguishing process, the statement added.\n\nSo far, the fire was restricted in area of around 300 to 400 square yards and not spreading. As there are no human settlements there, no injuries to any person have been reported so far.\n\nRescue 1122 DG Shaikh told Dawn.com that KMC’s fire Brigade and oil refinery used massive quantities of water and foam but the fire could not be doused.\n\nHe added that the experts of the SSGC and the Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL) had conducted soil testing of the area and taken away samples — the results of which were expected within five to six hours to determine what was actually triggering the fire.\n\nShaikh also hinted at the possibility of “some pockets” of underground oil or gas that had emerged during the digging work in the coastal area for a housing scheme.\n\nZaman Town SHO told Dawn.com that the both the Oil and Gas Development Company Limited and PPL had said that they had no line belonging to them in the vicinity.\n\nHowever, he added that there was an oil refinery line there — indicating the possibility of an underground reservoir of crude oil, which caught fire.\n\nFire incidents are common in the metropolis due to the absence of adequate fire safety measures in buildings.\n\nEarlier this month, a fire broke out at Kawish Plaza on Sharea Faisal Road prompting an operation to rescue people inside the building.\n\nSeparately, a fire broke out in a gas pipeline near Al-Hamid School in North Karachi, according to a Rescue 1122 spokesperson.\n\n“As soon as the Central Command and Control Rescue 1122 received the information, the fire and rescue team, along with one ambulance and one fire brigade truck reached the scene,” the spokesperson said.\n\nThey added that Rescue 1122 is in the process of controlling the fire.\n\nThe Edhi Foundation also confirmed that its ambulances and volunteers are engaged in relief activities at the scene of the fire.",
