  "content": "KARACHI: Leader of the Opposition in the City Council Advocate Saifuddin of the Jamaat-i-Islami has sent a letter to the Sindh Building Control Authority’s director general, demanding him to act decisively against massive illegal construction in the metropolis.\n\nAdvocate Saifuddin expressed ‘concerns’ regarding widespread illegal construction taking place across Karachi and said the mushroom growth of unauthorised buildings reflected rampant corruption within the SBCA.\n\n“This unchecked development is causing significant hardships for the general public, including shortages of essential services such as electricity, gas and water. The situation is worsening by severe sewerage and parking issues,” he stated.\n\nHe called ‘alarming’ that officials within the SBCA appeared to be colluding with the ‘builder mafia’ responsible for those illegal constructions and that alleged collaboration was going on with the help of ‘black money’.\n\nOpposition leader in City Council urges authority to collaborate with UC representatives\n\n“This not only undermines the authority’s mandate, but also allows these activities to thrive, with billions of rupees in black money circulating through unrecorded cash transactions related to the sale and purchase of these unlawfully constructed properties. Neither are these transactions documented, nor is the money involved in the construction taxed,” added Advocate Saifuddin.\n\nThe opposition leader demanded the SBCA chief an immediate action to address the ‘crisis’, seeking his role to halt illegal construction presently in progress.\n\nHe also asked him for action against the authority’s officials responsible for such illegal activities.\n\n“Additionally, we suggest that the SBCA should collaborate with union committees (UCs) as they are the only grassroots-level forums operating under the leadership of the elected public representatives. The UCs should be informed of any submitted building plans and the status of upcoming construction projects in their respective areas,” he added.\n\nThe opposition leader also proposed a mechanism for action against the illegal construction and taking the representatives of the local government system onboard that could help devise effective system against the unauthorised business.\n\n“We also recommend that prompt action be taken on complaints regarding illegal constructions. If any unlawful activity is reported in an area, the town-level SBCA staff responsible should be held accountable. Criminal cases should be registered against both the builders and the SBCA officials found complicit in these activities,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 29th, 2025",
