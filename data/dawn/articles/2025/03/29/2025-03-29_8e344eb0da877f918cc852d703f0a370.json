  "content": "Mark Chapman struck a sublime century and Nathan Smith claimed four wickets Saturday as New Zealand eased to a 73-run win over Pakistan in the first one-day international in Napier.\n\nChapman’s career-best 132 formed the foundation of an imposing 344-9 at McLean Park before Pakistan’s promising chase capitulated to be all out for 271 in the 45th over.\n\nThe tourists looked on track at 249-3, at that point needing 96 runs to win, with more than 11 overs remaining.\n\nHowever, seamer Smith (4-60) helped to spark a late collapse, with the last seven wickets falling for 22 runs.\n\nEarlier, the recalled Babar Azam top-scored for Pakistan with 78 off 83 balls, but it was his dismissal that started the rot.\n\nSalman Agha struck a defiant 58 off 48, but he was let down by a series of loose shots from lower order teammates as New Zealand moved one-up in the three-match series.\n\nChapman’s 111-ball innings featured 13 fours and four sixes, lifting New Zealand out of early trouble after they were asked to bat and stuttered to 50-3.\n\nThe left-hander put on 199 for the fourth wicket with Daryl Mitchell (76 off 84) before the home side’s innings was finished off in record-breaking fashion by debut all-rounder Muhammad Abbas.\n\nPakistan-born Abbas struck 52, setting a world record for the fastest half-century on debut when he reached 50 off the 24th ball he faced. Pakistan’s seam-heavy attack capitalised on lively bounce, but they were punished later.\n\nLeft-arm quick Akif Javed claimed 2-55 on his international debut, but the best figures were recorded by part-time seamer Irfan Khan, who took 3-51 off five expensive overs at the death.\n\nBoth teams feature numerous changes to those who played out a five-match T20 series, won 4-1 by New Zealand.\n\nThe second match of the series is in Hamilton on Wednesday.",
