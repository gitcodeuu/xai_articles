  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The president of National Party Punjab chapter, Ayub Malik, has condemned the issuance of notice by the Federal Investigation Agency to prominent left-wing intellectual Dr Taimur Rahman, demanding of the government to immediately withdraw it.\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, Mr Malik said the action of the FIA amounted to stifling critical and dissenting voices.\n\n“It is also an attack on freedom of expression which should not be allowed in a democratic society and a country where freedom of expression has been guaranteed by the articles enshrined in the constitution,” Mr Malik said, adding that his party stands in solidarity with Dr Taimur Rehman and believes such tactics of the FIA cannot deter him from exercising his democratic right to express his views openly.\n\nAyub Malik demanded of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, chief minister Punjab Maryam Nawaz and Pakistan People’s Party chairman Bilawal Bhutto to take notice of this FIA action and play their role in getting the FIA notice withdrawn.\n\nHe also appealed to all progressive forces to show solidarity with Dr Rahman and extend him full support.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 29th, 2025",
