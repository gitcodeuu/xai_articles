  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakis­tan Volleyball Federation (PVF) on Friday annou­nced its ambition to break into the world’s top 30 rankings by 2026 to compete in the qualifying rounds for the 2028 Oly­mpic Games, urging the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) and private sector to bolster support for the mission.\n\nPVF Chairman Chau­dhry Mohammad Yaqoob outlined the roadmap during a press conference detailing the 54th National Senior Volleyball Cham­pionship, scheduled from April 4-10 in Wah Cantt.\n\nHe emphasised that achieving the ranking target would require “maximum financial and logistic support” from stakeholders.\n\n“Though it seems a hard target, the current potential of our players and their impressive performances make it possible,” Yaqoob said, highlighting recent strides in the sport.\n\nPakistan junior team won the U-18 CAVA Championship and bronze medal in the Asian U-18 Volleyball Championship in 2024.\n\nYaqoob noted that 10 Pakistani players are currently competing in international leagues, earning between $4,000 to $8,000, underscoring the country’s talent pool.\n\nTo strengthen preparations, the PVF has hired an Iranian head coach, two assistant coaches and a dedicated coach for the women’s team.\n\nYaqoob also revealed plans to host Russia’s junior team for a five-match series ahead of the Junior World Championship in Uzbekistan this July.\n\nIn a regional diplomatic nod, he added that India’s volleyball team was the first to confirm participation in the Asian Central Volleyball Championship, which Pakistan will host in May- June.\n\nThe upcoming National Senior Volleyball Cham­pionship will feature 14 teams, including Wapda, Army, PAF, provincial squads, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir.\n\nMatches will be split into four groups, with the top two from each advancing to the league-stage round. Coaches will scout the event to finalise squads for international competitions.\n\nYaqoob, however, flagged infrastructure gaps, stressing the need for “quality air-conditioned volleyball halls” to meet global standards.\n\nThe PVF’s push comes amid a resurgence in Pakistani volleyball, with the senior team recently climbing to 46th in global rankings and the junior side securing a World Championship berth.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 29th, 2025",
