  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan would continue to support the people of Palestine and Jammu and Kashmir in achieving their freedom from occupying forces.\n\nHe was addressing the ceremony of “Rab-i-Zuljalal ka Ehsaan — Pakistan” and National Youth and Ulema Convention organised by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting here on Friday. Federal ministers, parliamentarians, ambassadors from Islamic countries, religious scholars and youth participated in the convention.\n\nHe expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and Kashmir who were being oppressed by the occupying forces. He said that Israel killed over 50,000 Palestinians and had violated the ceasefire, and again began to kill people in Palestine.\n\nSays economic, social and security challenges can be dealt through joint efforts\n\nAs the event was organised in connection with Jummatul Wida, especially the 27th night of Ramazan, PM Shehbaz said he was speaking on a sacred day and in a month in which Allah Almighty revealed the Holy Quran through His Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). This month, Allah Almighty gave the blessing of Pakistan, which became independent due to the great sacrifices of old and young who crossed the river of blood to migrate to their new homeland, he remarked.\n\nReferring to the challenges confronting Pakistan at the economic, social and security fronts, the PM said they could be overcome through unity and joint efforts, and called upon the people from all walks of life to come forward with a spirit of patriotism.\n\nHe urged upon the ulema to take responsibility to promote unity and brotherhood in society, adding that everyone should rise above sectarian differences and give preference to national issues over their personal wishes for the stability and betterment of Pakistan.\n\nHe appealed to ulema to promote positive thinking and the habit of research so that the spread of fake news and malicious propaganda could be stopped. He said it was the demand of the time that people should show unity and harmony to resolve issues faced by Pakistan.\n\nPM Sharif said the security forces gave immense sacrifices in the war against terrorism to secure the country’s future.\n\nHowever, he added, the coming generations would not forgive if unity was not displayed to overcome the threat of terrorism and ulema would have to play an important role in this regard.\n\nHe said the world powers were against the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but despite all odds, in 1998 Pakistan became a nuclear power and due to the nuclear capability and the brave armed forces, no enemy could cast an evil eye towards the country.\n\nThe PM said Allah endowed Pakistan with numerous blessings and intelligent people in every field. “Pakistan is also blessed with trillions of dollars worth of natural resources. The foreign elements who are giving financial support to terrorists also do not want Pakistan to gain benefit from its mineral resources,” he added.\n\nPakistan could pay off its debts by exploiting its mineral resources to secure its lost status in the world, he said, adding that the father of the nation wanted a Pakistan where Muslims and minorities enjoyed religious freedom and minorities were protected.\n\nThe PM said, “If we follow the teachings of Quran and the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and our great leaders, we can achieve our due status in the world.”\n\nHe was of the opinion that without economic progress, political independence could not be achieved. He said it was responsibility of the state to enable the citizens to live their lives according to Islam, and added that no law could be made contrary to the teachings of Islam.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 29th, 2025",
