  "content": "QUETTA: Amid tight security, the Jaffar Express with over 400 passengers on board, restarted its journey and departed for Peshawar from Quetta railway station on Friday after remaining suspended for 17 days.\n\nMinister for Railways Hanif Abbasi had announced the government plan to resume Jaffar Express and Bolan Mail ope­­rations during his recent visit to Quetta.\n\nPakistan Railways had suspended its entire operations from Punjab and Sindh to Balochistan and vice versa, following the horrific attack on the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express claimed by Balochistan Liberation Army terrorists, killing many and taking passengers hostages in the Mashkaf area of Kachhi district on March 11. Consequently, the security forces conducted a successful operation that lasted two days.\n\nTalking to Dawn, a senior official of Pakistan Railways said Jaffar Express, which had started its journey from Pesh­awar, reached Quetta on Friday night.\n\nHe added that an Eid special train would also leave from Quetta on Saturday.\n\nMember of the National Assembly Jamal Shah Kakar saw off the hundreds of passengers and expressed his gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi for the immediate measures taken for the restoration of the rail link.\n\nMr Kakar said the resumption of Jaffar Express service would provide convenience to passengers. He said the revival of railways was a positive development for the people of Balochistan.\n\nDue to the suspension of rail services, airlines were charging exorbitant fares.\n\nIn addition to Jaffar Express, eight new trains would be operating from Balochistan.\n\nMr Kakar mentioned that he had raised his voice in the NA Standing Committee for the restoration of railways and the addition of more trains, which led to the announcement by the government to run eight more trains from Balochistan, in addition to the Jaffar Express.\n\nMeanwhile, the divisional superintendent of railways confirmed to Dawn that security had been improved.\n\nHe said Jaffar Express, which had departed from Peshawar, reached Quetta at 8pm on Friday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 29th, 2025",
