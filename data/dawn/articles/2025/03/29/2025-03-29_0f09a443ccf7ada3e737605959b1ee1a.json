On the other hand, the outflow movements decreased by 13pc.\n\nIOM data shows over 100pc increase in returns between second and third week of March, attributes it to ‘voluntary returns’\n\nThe Torkham border crossing between Pakistan and Afghanistan in the latter’s Nangarhar province had been closed due to security concerns since Feb 21. However, it resumed cross-border movements on March 22.\n\nUnder a Pakistani government notification, all Afghan nationals are required to leave Islamabad and Rawalpindi by March 31 — some due to be relocated to other cities within Pakistan and others to be deported back to Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the first two weeks of March, outflow movements at the Islam Qala border crossing in Afghanistan showed a modest decline as compared to February’s figures.
