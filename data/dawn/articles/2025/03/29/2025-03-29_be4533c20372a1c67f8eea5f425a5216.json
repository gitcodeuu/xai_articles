Having previously served as a player (2016-2019), captain (2016), batting coach (2023) and assistant coach (2024), Bopara’s deep understanding of the team’s dynamics and his extensive experience in T20 cricket make him an ideal choice to lead the side in PSL 10.\n\nMeanwhile, Masroor, who has had a long-standing association with Karachi Kings as fielding coach and assistant coach, has been entrusted with the additional responsibility of high-performance coach. His expertise in player development and strategic planning will play a key role in elevating the team’s performance standards.\n\nThe franchise also extended its gratitude to outgoing head coach Phil Simmons for his exceptional contributions during PSL 9, where he played a pivotal role in reshaping the Kings’ approach and laying the foundation for a competitive squad.\n\nThe management wished him the very best for his new role as the head coach of the Bangladesh national team.\n\nCommenting on the appointments, Kings’ Owner Salman Iqbal said, “We are delighted to welcome Ravi Bopara as our head coach for PSL 10. His journey with Karachi Kings from player and then as part of our coaching staff reflects his deep commitment to the franchise. We are confident that his leadership will bring a fresh energy to the squad.\n\n“Additionally, Masroor’s promotion as high-performance coach is a testament to his hard work and dedication over the years. Together, they form a strong coaching unit that will drive Karachi Kings towards success.”\n\nThe 10th edition of PSL is set to begin on April 11, with Karachi Kings playing their first match on April 12, at their home ground, the National Bank Stadium, where they will clash with Multan Sultans.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 29th, 2025",
