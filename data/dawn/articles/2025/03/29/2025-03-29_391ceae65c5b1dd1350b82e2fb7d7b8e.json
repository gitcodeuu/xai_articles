Thank you.”\n\nHe urged massive relief efforts in the wake of the disaster and said he had “opened all ways for foreign aid”.\n\nMass casualty area\n\nFour years of civil war sparked by the military seizing power have ravaged Myanmar’s infrastructure and healthcare system, leaving it ill-equipped to respond to such a disaster.\n\nMyanmar declared a state of emerge­ncy across the six worst-affected regi­o­­ns after the quake, which the World Health Organisation described as a “very, very big threat to life and health”.\n\nHundreds of casualties arrived at a major hospital in Naypyidaw where the emergency department entrance had collapsed on a car.\n\nA hospital official described it as a “mass casualty area” with medics treating the wounded outside. “I haven’t seen (something) like this before. We are trying to handle the situation. I’m so exhausted now,” a doctor told AFP.\n\nAs night fell, journalists saw rescuers trying to extract a mother and son from the ruins of a collapsed building in Naypyidaw. Both were seriously injured but rescuers were unable to reach them, a Red Cross worker said.\n\nSkyscraper collapses\n\nAcross the border in Thailand, a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed to a tangled heap of rubble and dust in a matter of seconds.\n\nOfficials have said three workers are confirmed dead with dozens more still unaccounted for, many believed trapped in the rubble.\n\n“I heard people calling for help, saying ‘help me’,” Worapat Sukthai, deputy police chief of Bang Sue district, said.\n\n“We estimate that hundreds of people are injured,” he said.\n\nAs night fell, around 100 rescue workers assembled at the scene to search for survivors, illuminated by specially erected floodlights.\n\nVisiting the site, Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said “every building” in Bangkok would need to be inspected for safety, though it was not immediately clear how that would be carried out.\n\nAn emergency zone was declared in Bangkok, where some metro and light rail services were suspended.\n\nThe streets were full of commuters attempting to walk home, or simply taking refuge in the entra­nces of malls and office buildings.\n\nCity authorities said parks would stay open overnight for those unable to sleep at home.\n\nStrong quakes are extremely rare in Thailand, and across Bangkok and the northern tourist destination of Chiang Mai, where the power briefly went out, stunned residents hurried outside, unsure of how to respond.\n\nSai, 76, rushed out of a minimart in Chiang Mai when the shop started to shake.\n\n“This is the strongest tremor I’ve experienced in my life.” The quake was felt across the region, with China, Cambodia, Bangladesh and India all reporting tremors.\n\nIndia, France and the European Union all offered to provide assistance, while the WHO said it was mobilising its logistics hub in Dubai to prepare trauma injury supplies.\n\nPope Francis said he was “deeply saddened by the loss of life and widespread devastation” in a telegram published by the Vatican.\n\nEarthquakes are relatively common in Myanmar, where six strong quakes of 7.0-magnitude or more struck between 1930 and 1956 near the Sagaing Fault, which runs north to south through the centre of the country, according to the United States Geological Survey.\n\nA powerful 6.8-magnitude earthquake in the ancient capital Bagan in central Myanmar killed three people in 2016, also toppling spires and crumbling temple walls at the tourist destination.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 29th, 2025",
