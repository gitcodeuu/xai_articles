Everyday, children in the West Bank run the gauntlet of Israeli roadblocks, checkpoints and settler attacks on their way to school.\n\nThousands of troops are sweeping through refugee camps and cities and demolishing houses and infrastructure, including roads children use to get to school.\n\nThe impact on children’s education is reminiscent of the havoc caused in the Gaza Strip during the war.\n\n“The ability for Palestinian children to access quality education in the West Bank or in Gaza has never been under more stress,” said Alexandra Saieh, global head of humanitarian policy and advocacy at Save the Children.\n\nTo make matters worse, the UN Palestinian relief agency UNRWA, which runs 96 schools in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, could be forced to stop its work following an Israeli ban on its operations on Israeli territory.\n\nAnd funding cuts from major donors, including the United States where President Donald Trump has terminated thousands of foreign aid projects, could further cripple services.\n\nIn December, Sweden also cut its support, a decision the agency said came at the worst time for Palestinian refugees.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 25th, 2025",
