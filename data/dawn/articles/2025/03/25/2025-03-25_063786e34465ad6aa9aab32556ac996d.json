  "content": "QUETTA: Former chief minister, president of the Balochistan National Party, Sardar Akhtar Mengal, has accused the president and prime minister of being “complicit” in the arrest of women leaders of the Baloch Yakjehti Committee.\n\nIn a post on social media platform X, Mr Mengal said he stood by President Asif Zardari and PM Shehbaz Sharif when their sister and niece, respectively, were “humiliated”.\n\nHe was referring to the arrests of Faryal Talpur, sister of Mr Zardari and Maryam Nawaz Sharif, the niece of Mr Sharif, during the PTI government of PM Imran Khan.\n\n“We stood by you because, for us, respect comes first. Attacking women is where we draw the line. We have always placed the dignity of women above politics,” he wrote.\n\n“Today, my daughters are being dragged through the streets without their headscarves”. Not only are you remaining silent, but you are equally complicit in this injustice. I will never forget this — this is a promise from a Baloch,“ he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 25th, 2025",
