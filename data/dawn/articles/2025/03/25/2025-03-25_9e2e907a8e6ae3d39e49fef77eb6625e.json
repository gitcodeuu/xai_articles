  "content": "SAN FRANCISCO: Pioneering US genetic testing company 23and Me has filed for bankruptcy and is looking for a buyer two years after hackers gained access to millions of profiles.\n\n23andMe, which sells a mail-back saliva test to determine ancestry or certain health-related genetic traits for less than $200, said late Sunday that it had “filed a voluntary petition for reorganisation” with a state bankruptcy court in Missouri.\n\nThe announcement prompted warnings for 23andMe customers to ask the company to delete their data amid privacy fears. At its height a few years ago, the DNA testing craze saw millions of consumers rushing to discover their ancestry and health information with tests from 23andMe becoming popular holiday gifts.\n\nThe Silicon Valley-based company, which went public in 2021, claims 15 million customers and has seen its sales decline in recent months as the testing craze faded and the company suffered a data breach. 23andMe said that it rejected a takeover offer from its co-founder and CEO Anne Wojcicki, who has resigned from her position but will remain on the company’s board of directors, according to the statement.\n\nOn X, Wojcicki posted that “While I am disappointed that we have come to this conclusion and my bid was rejected, I am supportive of the company and I intend to be a bidder.”\n\nShe explained that her resignation as CEO was strategic so as to “be in the best position to pursue the company as an independent bidder.” Wojcicki, who co-founded 23andMe 19 years ago, acknowledged the company’s challenges but emphasised her “unwavering” belief in its future. Faced with the difficulties, 23andMe announced the dismissal of 40 per cent of its staff in November, about 200 people.\n\nIt also suspended its research programmes.\n\nIn a regulatory filing, 23andMe also said that it has agreed to pay approximately $37.5 million to settle claims related to the 2023 data breach.\n\nThe 2023 hacking incident saw 6.9 million accounts affected, of which 5.5 million contained information on genetic matches.\n\nUsing customers’ old passwords, the hackers compromised data that included names, sex, birth year, location, photos, health information, and genetic ancestry results.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 25th, 2025",
