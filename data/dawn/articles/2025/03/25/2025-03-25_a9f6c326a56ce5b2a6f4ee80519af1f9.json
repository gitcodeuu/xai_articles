However, attendees are prohibited from making any media statements outside the jail premises.\n\nThe court emphasised that only persons approved by Mr Khan’s coordinator, Salman Akram Raja, will be permitted to meet him in jail. Furthermore, the PTI founder has been advised to apply to the trial court to seek permission for telephonic contact with his children.\n\nDuring the hearing, PTI lawyers, including Salman Akram Raja and Chaudhry Zaheer Abbas, appeared in court to contest the limitations imposed on meetings.\n\nThe additional superintendent of Adiala Jail submitted a detailed response regarding the matter. PTI’s legal team argued that their meetings were not being conducted as per established standard operating procedures (SOPs), with lawyer Zaheer Abbas stating that even on March 20, a scheduled meeting did not take place.\n\nThe court deliberated on the security concerns raised by the jail authorities. Jail Superi­ntendent’s lawyer Naveed Malik informed the bench that prior to December, the PTI founder was allowed biweekly meetings. However, after his conviction in January, security concerns led to a modification of the schedule, reducing the meetings to one day with two sessions. “According to the jail rules, the superintendent of Adiala Jail has the authority [to schedule the meetings accordingly],” he added.\n\nHe further argued that these meetings were being misused for political purposes, with statements being made to the media after each session.\n\nActing Chief Justice Sarfaraz Dogar questioned the necessity of media briefings following these meetings. He remarked that the court was willing to reinstate the two-day meetings provided there were assurances against political statements.\n\nAdvocate Naveed Malik expressed concerns that previous commitments were not honoured, citing the disposal of 98 applications on the issue.\n\n“If you had implemented it, 98 applications would not have been filed,” Justice Arbab Muhammad Tahir retorted.\n\nTo address these concerns, the high court ruled that an undertaking be provided, ensuring that no media interactions take place after meetings.\n\nThe IHC administration had constituted a three-member larger bench — headed by newly appointed Acting Chief Justice Sardar Sarfraz Dogar — to hear all 26 petitions related to visitation rights and jail conditions.\n\nPTI ‘split’ over decision\n\nThe PTI, however, appeared split on the court decision. PTI spokesperson Sheikh Waqas Akram, while talking to Dawn, said that as per his understanding, the court has only stopped visitors from holding media talks outside Adiala Jail.\n\n“The decision has been given due to security reasons. However, those who will meet Imran Khan will be able to hold press conferences at the press club or the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa House or will give comments on talk shows or they will post the details on social media,” he said.\n\n“We take it as our victory because party leaders were not being allowed to meet the founding chairman for the last six months. Because of the decision, now we will be able to meet him without any hurdle. We are satisfied with the decision and we accept it,” Mr Akram said.\n\nPTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said the decision was against the spirit of the Constitution. “It is our constitutional right to meet Imran Khan and share the details of meetings with the masses,” he told Dawn.\n\nHe also mentioned that it was his “personal opinion”.\n\n“We will discuss it within the party and input will be taken from the lawyers if we should challenge the decision or cope with it,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 25th, 2025",
