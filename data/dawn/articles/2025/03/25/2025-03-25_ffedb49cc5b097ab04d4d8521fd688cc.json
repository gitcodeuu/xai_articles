Pakistan has made terrorism its central concern in ties with Kabul, citing a sharp increase in attacks by the banned TTP and other militant groups operating from the Afghan territory. The closure of the Torkham border, which lasted nearly a month, further underscored the significance of border disputes in the overall relationship. The border was reopened under a temporary arrangement that will remain in place until April 15. During visit, Mr Sadiq and Mr Muttaqi agreed to continue discussions on border management and security cooperation.\n\nThe Afghan leadership, while acknowledging Pakistan’s concerns, highlighted the importance of trade and transit for Afghanistan, which is a landlocked country dependent on regional connectivity.\n\nMr Muttaqi urged Pakistan not to link trade and transit with other disputes, a stance that Afghanistan has consistently maintained.\n\nEconomic cooperation emerged as a key topic during Mr Sadiq’s engagements in Kabul. Speaking at a ceremony at the Pakistan Embassy before concluding his trip, Mr Sadiq reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to fostering economic collaboration, stating that Pakistan and Afgha­nistan’s economic interests are intrinsically interlinked and that peace and progress in Afghanistan are essential for regional stability.\n\nMr Sadiq on that occasion stressed that both countries must work together to enhance bilateral trade and promote regional connectivity, reiterating Pakistan’s commitment to a strong and mutually beneficial relationship with Afghanistan.\n\nAs a result of Mr Sadiq’s visit, both sides agreed to convene a Joint Coordination Committee meeting potentially before April 15 to focus on strengthening trade and economic ties.\n\nTrade ministers of Pakistan and Afghanistan will hold consultations before Eidul Fitr, and Afghanistan’s commerce minister is expected to visit Pakistan after Eid. The plan for Ishaq Dar’s visit to Kabul, which had previously been on hold, was also revived and discussed during the meetings.\n\nThe importance of trade was further emphasised during Mr Sadiq’s discussions with Afghan Trade Minister Azizi, where they addressed trade and transit challenges, the need to prevent political tensions from disrupting economic ties, and the resolution of key economic issues.\n\nBoth sides, during Mr Sadiq’s meeting with Mr Azizi, agreed to hold frequent bilateral meetings, normalise trade relations, finalise the Preferential Trade Agreement, and address outstanding matters under the Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit and Trade Agreement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 25th, 2025",
