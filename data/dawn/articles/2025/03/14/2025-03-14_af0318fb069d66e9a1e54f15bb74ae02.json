  "content": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened to impose 200 per cent tariffs on wine, champagne and other alcoholic beverages from European Union countries, in retaliation against the bloc’s planned levies on US-produced whiskey.\n\nTrump has launched trade wars against competitors and partners alike since taking office, wielding tariffs as a tool to pressure countries on commerce and other policy issues.\n\nHis latest salvo was a response to the European Union’s unveiling of tariffs on $28 billion in US goods, starting in stages from April.\n\nThe EU measures — including a sharp tariff hike on American whiskey — were in turn retaliation against Trump’s levies on steel and aluminum imports that took effect Wednesday.\n\n“If this Tariff is not removed immediately, the US will shortly place a 200% Tariff on all WINES, CHAMPAGNES, & ALCOHOLIC PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF FRANCE AND OTHER E.U. REPRESENTED COUNTRIES,” Trump posted on his Truth Social platform.\n\nTrump also renewed his harsh criticism of the bloc, singling out its 50pc levy on US whiskey as “nasty.” He termed the EU “one of the most hostile and abusive taxing and tariffing authorities in the World” and said the union — which for decades has been at the heart of a US-led Western alliance — was formed to take advantage of the United States.\n\nTrump later told reporters he would not bend on tariffs, be they on aluminum or steel or cars, even as European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said the bloc is ready to negotiate over the escalating duties.\n\nFrance pledged to fight back against any tariffs on wine and other alcoholic beverages.\n\n“We will not give in to threats,” Foreign Trade Minister Laurent Saint-Martin said Thursday on X. He added France was “determined to retaliate.” US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Bloomberg Television Thursday that he had plans to speak with his European counterparts, without providing details.\n\nAn EU spokesperson told AFP its trade chief has reached out to Washington.\n\nThe EU earlier said it deeply regrets the US introduction of steel and aluminum tariffs, with spokesman Olof Gill adding that it would feel the same about any future measures while urging Wash­in­gton to revoke the duties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
