  "content": "Russia on Friday said President Vladimir Putin had sent “additional” signals to United States counterpart Donald Trump about a Washington-proposed ceasefire in Ukraine, adding it was “cautiously optimistic” about the prospect of a deal.\n\nUS envoy Steve Witkoff met Putin late on Thursday to lay out the details of the joint US-Ukrainian plan, which envisages a 30-day pause in hostilities between Moscow and Kyiv after three years of fighting.\n\nThe Kremlin said Putin conveyed “additional” signals to Trump via Witkoff and that the two leaders could speak once Trump had been briefed on these messages.\n\n“When Mr Witkoff brings all the information to President Trump, we will determine the timing of a conversation,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\n“There is an understanding on all sides that such a conversation is needed.”\n\nUS National Security Adviser Mike Waltz said in a Fox News interview that the US had “some cautious optimism” after Witkoff’s visit.\n\nCommenting on Waltz’s remarks, Peskov said today: “There are reasons to be cautiously optimistic.\n\n“There is still much to be done, but the president has nevertheless identified with President Trump’s position.”\n\nPutin said on Thursday that he backed the idea of a truce with Ukraine, but said he had “serious questions” about how it would be implemented that he wanted to discuss with Trump.\n\nThe Russian leader said he wanted any settlement to secure “long-term peace”, alluding to Moscow’s demand that Ukraine be barred from Nato.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Thursday condemned Putin’s ambivalent response to the proposal as “very manipulative”, while Germany called it a “delaying tactic”.\n\nTrump pleaded with his Russian counterpart to spare the lives of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers on the frontline, as he expressed hope for an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine.\n\n“I have strongly requested to President Putin that their lives be spared,” Trump wrote today on his Truth Social platform following what he described as a “very good and productive discussions” with Putin.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, told the Russian president that the kingdom supports “all initiatives” to end the Ukraine war, a statement said today.\n\nThe crown prince reaffirmed Saudi Arabia’s “commitment to facilitating dialogue and supporting all initiatives aimed at achieving a political resolution” in a phone call with Putin, a foreign ministry statement said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Group of Seven foreign ministers published a unified statement backing US-led calls for a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia, host Canada said today, despite friction with Trump.\n\n“Through our long conversations, we were able to find strong G7 unity on a variety of issues that were discussed and one that I would like to highlight in particular is the one linked to Ukraine,” Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly told reporters on the last day of the talks in Quebec.\n\n“All G7 foreign ministers agree with the US proposal of a ceasefire that is supported by Ukrainians and we are now studying and looking at the Russian reaction,” she said. “So, ultimately, the ball is now in Russia’s court when it comes to Ukraine.”\n\nThe club of wealthy democracies — Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US — has been rattled by Trump’s outreach to Russia since returning to office and his heavy pressure on Ukraine, which Moscow invaded in 2022.\n\nBut diplomacy dramatically shifted on Tuesday when Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was taking part in the Quebec talks, met Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia, with Kyiv backing a proposal for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire.",
