We will continue our politics, but on the crucial issue of saving the country from terrorism, we must stand as one,” he said. The premier said he would call a meeting for consultations to decide the next course of action.\n\nSpeaking about the Bolan attack, the prime minister said that while they had managed to save the lives of citizens in the recent incident, the nation could ill-afford a similar event again.\n\n“For that, we must all play our role,” he said, referring to federal and provincial authorities. The prime minister asserted that the entire country could not prosper and develop if Balochistan’s pace of development did not catch up with other provinces.\n\n“Peace can’t be established in Pakistan until terrorism is completely eliminated in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan.”\n\nThe prime minister questioned why terrorism had raised its head again in the subsequent years, and said the release of thousands of Taliban fighters from jails had caused the surge.\n\nThe prime minister said the army personnel were sacrificing their lives in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan to save the people of Pakistan from this scourge, and regretted the language used by some elements within the country against the armed forces and Pakistan.\n\nPoisoned propaganda against the armed forces was not acceptable and tolerable, he warned.\n\nPM Shehbaz also underlined the need to raise a new force equipped with modern weapons and equipment in Balochistan and said he was ready to provide all necessary resources to counter the menace of terrorism.\n\n“Let there be no doubt that any attempt to destabilise our homeland through such treachery will be met with the full and unyielding might of our state. It is not merely a battle against [one] militant outfit but a war against an ideology of lawlessness and despair.”\n\nLater, the PM and army chief Gen Asim Munir visited the Combined Military Hospital (CMH) Quetta, where they met the injured victims and affected families.\n\nShehbaz-Bugti meeting\n\nIn a meeting with the prime minister, Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti said that attacks on unarmed travellers, women, children, and labourers was unacceptable as per Balochistan’s traditions.\n\nHe said that the path terrorists were taking in this conflict was strongly condemned by the Baloch political leadership and the nation.\n\nHe also stressed that associating such acts of terrorism with the Baloch identity is wrong.\n\nThe CM stated that terrorists aimed to disrupt peace and order in Balochistan, but they cannot hold even an inch of land for more than three to four hours anywhere in the province.\n\nHe added that terrorists attempt to create fear and panic by recording videos within a short period to spread terror. However, the government and security agencies are taking effective measures to counter this temporary impression, he added.\n\nWith input from APP / Saleem Shahid in Quetta\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
