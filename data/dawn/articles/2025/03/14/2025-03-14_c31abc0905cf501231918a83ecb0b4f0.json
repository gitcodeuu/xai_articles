  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Germany’s junior hockey team capped off their tour of Pakistan in a spectacular fashion, securing a superb 4-1 victory over their Pakistan counterparts here at the Naseer Bunda Hockey Stadium on Thursday.\n\nThe win steered world champions Germany to a 4-0 clean sweep of the four-match series.\n\nEarlier, the touring side won the first three matches, staged in Lahore, 2-1, 2-1 and 4-3.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, the young Germans demonstrated an impressive level of precision and teamwork that the Pakistan side struggled to counter. Despite moments of resilience and spirited play from the Pakistan juniors, the consistency and efficiency of the tourists proved too much for the host team to handle.\n\nThe series was designed to provide the Pakistan juniors with crucial international exposure as they gear up for this year’s Junior World Cup taking place in India.\n\nThe matches were held in Lahore and Islamabad, marking a significant step in Pakistan’s efforts to revive international hockey in the country.\n\nThough the results were disappointing for the home fans, the series represented a crucial opportunity for the Pakistan juniors to gain invaluable experience against world-class opponents.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
