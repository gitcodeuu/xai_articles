  "content": "KARACHI: Amid allegations and counter-allegations between the members from both sides of the aisle, the Sindh Assembly on Thursday unanimously passed a resolution against the construction of six new canals on the Indus River.\n\nThe resolution, tabled by Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, also demanded an immediate halt to any plans, activities or work related to the controversial project until an agreement with all provincial governments, particularly Sindh, was reached to ensure that the rights of the province was fully protected and respected.\n\nThe speakers from the two sides condemned the federal government’s decision to construct new canals and many of them even termed it a threat to the harmony among provinces.\n\nWhile the chief minister, his cabinet members and treasury lawmakers said that Sindh had consistently maintained its stance on water distribution, the opposition members questioned the role of Pakistan Peoples Party, which supported the federal coalition government.\n\nSupporting the resolution but with reservations, the opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan, Jamaat-i-Islam and Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf lawmakers alleged that the provincial government had tabled the resolution with political designs and for face-saving as the people in parts of the province had already been lodging protest on the issue for the last one month.\n\nSpeaking on the resolution, the chief minister warned against any attempt to divert water from the Indus without consent of the province.\n\nHe questioned the rationale behind diverting water from Punjab’s fertile lands to Cholistan, arguing that such actions would have devastating consequences for both provinces.\n\nMr Shah recalled Sindh’s previous objections to various canal projects, leading to agreements such as the Sindh-Punjab Water Accord of 1945.\n\n“We are being told that water will be taken from Punjab’s most fertile lands and diverted to Cholistan and that we should not object,” he said and asked if Punjab would allow its most productive regions, like Chaj Doab and Rachna Doab, to dry up just to irrigate a desert.\n\nHe reminded the assembly that past objections from Sindh led to the formation of multiple commissions and, ultimately, to the Sindh-Punjab Agreement, which set clear guidelines for water allocation.\n\nThe CM urged all stakeholders to adhere to the historic agreements and ensure a fair distribution of water, keeping in mind the rights of Sindh’s people.\n\nHe said that the matter of new canal’s construction was lying with CCI for approval. “If CCI also approves this project, we will go to the joint parliament,” he added.\n\nSupporting the resolution, Opposition Leader Ali Khurshi said that the MQM-P had also stood with Sindh against Kalabagh Dam and Thal Canal.\n\n“If Asif Ali Zardari has cleared it at a big forum, why was there a need for a resolution in the provincial assembly?” he asked.\n\nHe said the house should be told as to how many times the Sindh government had talked to the federation about the problems of the people of Sindh. “The issue of gas was discussed, what was its follow-up in the assembly?” asked the government.\n\nHe said that the assembly sitting appeared to be a meeting of testimony and explanation and added that it was not a proper forum for opposing the project.\n\nHe said that Asif Zardari should call a meeting and oppose the canals.\n\nSenior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said that the entire province was united in raising its voice on real issues.\n\nHe said that before any major project was undertaken anywhere in the world, a feasibility report was prepared, and the benefit of one specific area could not be prioritised over the collective benefit of all.\n\nHe said that even during difficult times, President Asif Ali Zardari raised the slogan of “Pakistan Khappay” (We need Pakistan), and the PPP has always given top priority to Pakistan’s integrity.\n\nProvincial Ministers Syed Sardar Shah, Zia Lanjar, Muhammad Bux Mehar, Dr Azra Fazal Pechuho, Muhammad Ali Malkani and Jam Khan Shoro, PPP’s Jameel Soomro, Nadir Magsi, Fayyaz Butt, Imdad Pitafi, Nawab Sardar Khan Chandio, Karim Soomro, Dr Sikandar Shoro, MQM-P’s Sabir Qaimkhani, Fouzia Hameed, Iftikhar Ahmed, Muhammad Usman, Kiran Masood, PTI’s Shabbir Qureshi, Rehan Bandukda, Bilal Khan Jadoon and Sajjad Soomro, and JI’s Muhammad Farooq also spoke on the resolution.\n\nLater, Speaker Syed Awais Shah adjourned the house to Friday at 2:30pm.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
