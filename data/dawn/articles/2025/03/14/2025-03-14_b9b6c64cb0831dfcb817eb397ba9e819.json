  "content": "LAHORE: As a major operation to rescue passengers and crew of the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express has been accomplished by the security forces, Pakistan Railways (PR) on Thursday launched a relief operation to lift the derailed coaches of the train and clear the track after necessary repair and maintenance.\n\nOn the other hand, the PR has confirmed martyrdom of its two officials by the terrorists, stating that the families of the deceased staffers and the passengers would be compensated under the insurance cover and the prime minister’s package, according to PR’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Amir Ali Baloch.\n\n“The PR’s field formations concerned (Quetta and Sibbi railway stations) have arranged two relief trains having heavy cranes and other equipment. Both trains are currently at the incident site and busy in the relief operation to lift the coaches derailed due to blast by the terrorists on the track. The engineering officials reached at the site through the relief trains have also started repair of the track,” Mr Baloch said while talking to Dawn.\n\n“Our divisional superintendent (Quetta) is supervising the relief operation at the site,” the PR CEO said, adding that around 100 labourers have been engaged for the restoration works.\n\nPR confirms two employees martyred in attack\n\nTo a question, he confirmed martyrdom of two employees - one is from railway police and the second one from the engineering side designated as fitter. The heirs of both would be compensated under the State Life insurance cover and the PM’s package for those who lost their lives in terrorism-related incidents.\n\nSimilarly, the financial assistance would also be given to the heirs of the passengers martyred by the terrorists under the PM’s package to be delivered by the respective district administrations.\n\nTo a question, CEO Mr Baloch said he couldn’t tell the exact number of the killed and injured passengers.\n\n“The operation was carried out by security forces and I would side with the ISPR statement,” he said.\n\nTo another question, he said he didn’t receive any official statement related to the incident from the driver, assistant driver and other crew members.\n\n“Thanks God, the driver and others remained safe. But I have not yet received any statement from them,” he added.\n\nMeanwhile, PR Board Chairman and Railway Police Inspector General Syed Mazhar Ali Shah and Tahir Rai reached Quetta on Thursday and attended the funeral prayers of the martyred PR police constable Muhammad Mumtaz. They also met with the family of the deceased constable and offered fateha for the departed soul. A special ceremony was also held here in Lahore’s railway police Walton school to offer prayers for all martyred passengers of Jaffar express. The PR police have also tightened security at all major railway stations and rail installations and formations across the country.\n\nOn the other hand, the PR offices concerned in Peshawar, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Quetta and others have cancelled ticket reservation of Jaffar express, requesting the passengers to get refund.\n\n“We will resume the ticket/seat reservation for Jaffar express till resumption of its operation subject to clearance from the quarters concerned,” said an official in Lahore.\n\nHe said the departures of two major trains — Business express and Shah Hussain express were also cancelled by the Lahore railway station authorities due to very less number of passengers caused by the ongoing holy month of Ramazan.\n\n“Those having confirmed seat reservations for these trains were accommodated in Karachi-bound trains,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
