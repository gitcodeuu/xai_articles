He insisted that there was no rule of law in the country, with the government looking to be helpless.\n\nMr Abbasi said the situation in the country has deteriorated as the rulers considered the Constitution just a piece of paper.\n\nHe said there was the law of the jungle in the country, with people struggling to get justice.\n\nThe former PM called for serious efforts to eliminate the scourge of drugs.\n\nHe said the government should ensure the early arrest of the killers of Mushtaq Ahmad’s brother for punishment.\n\nAlso in the day, PTI Senator Liaqat Khan Tarakai visited the residence of Mushtaq Ahmad and offered condolences for the lawmaker’s brother.\n\nDIALOGUE PROPOSED: PTI leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiseron Thursday condemned the deadly train hijack in Balochistan and called for a wide-ranging dialogue for the eradication of terrorism from the country.\n\nIn a video statement, Mr Qaiser said representatives of all provinces and groups should sit down to discuss ways to protect public life and property amid growing incidents of terrorism.\n\nHe said the National Assembly should hold a detailed discussion on the current law and order situation in the country for a week, allowing its members to float proposals for strengthening the security mechanism and forging national unity.\n\n“If we fail today, we cannot succeed tomorrow,” he said\n\nMr Qaiser said all sections of the society and political and religious leadership should be on one page for the sake of national interest.\n\nHe said Pakistan’s borders with Iran and Afghanistan were fast becoming vulnerable, commercial activities were badly affected, the government had lost writ in the country, and people lacked confidence in politicians.\n\nThe PTI leader said that the economy had weakened to the core to the misery of people.\n\n“Strengthening the economy should be the top priority of the government. Without a strong economy, our survival will remain at stake,” he said.\n\nMr Qaiser said the federal government’s policies had failed to deliver the goods, so they should be reviewed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
