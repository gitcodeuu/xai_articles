France, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium and the United Kingdom have all announced recent aid cuts as economic and security priorities shift and budget pressures take hold.\n\nThe EU “needs to find a new way to prioritise its limited resources, for very legitimate reasons”, said Li Shuo, a climate analyst at the Asia Society Policy Institute. “This will make the climate finance discussion very difficult.”\n\n‘Worrying trends’\n\nAzerbaijan, which hosted the COP29 summit where the $300-billion deal was brokered, is seeking reassurances at a two-day meeting of climate negotiators in Tokyo that starts on Thursday.\n\nYalchin Rafiyev, the country’s top climate diplomat, said he would be asking developed nations if the cuts impacted money “they were thinking or planning to allocate for climate or not”.\n\n“We are not sure yet. There was not any concrete kind of climate fund cuts that we have heard from any of the parties. There were only some worrying trends,” he told AFP. He added: “We are opposed to any kind of action that can reduce the funding for climate action.”\n\nBrazil, which is hosting this year’s COP30 summit, said it was exploring ways to raise the enormous sums needed for developing countries to wean off fossil fuels and adapt to global warming.\n\nAccording to independent experts, these countries — excluding China — will require $1.3 trillion a year in outside assistance by 2035 to meet their climate needs.\n\nUnder the Paris Agreement, developed countries — those most responsible for global warming to date — are obligated to pay climate finance, but other countries do make their own voluntary contributions.\n\n“Climate finance for developing countries was already insufficient, but the recent cuts to foreign aid budgets represent a renewed challenge,” the COP30 presidency said in a written statement to AFP.\n\n‘Not looking good’\n\nDonors have struggled to meet their climate finance pledges at the best of times, even for commitments well below the $300bn pledged last year.\n\nDeveloped nations provided about $116bn in 2022, the latest year for which official OECD climate finance figures are available.\n\nThe US provided about 10 percent of that money. Trump’s spending freeze means other contributors will have to make up the difference.\n\nOther ways to possibly plug the shortfall — such as greater lending from multilateral development banks like the World Bank — are also in doubt.\n\n“You’re going to hear more and more that there simply isn’t money out there to fill up such a big pot… it’s not looking good,” Avantika Goswami, climate change lead at the Centre for Science and Environment in India, said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
