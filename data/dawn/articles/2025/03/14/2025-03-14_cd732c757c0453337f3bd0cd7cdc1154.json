  "content": "RAWALPINDI: On the occasion of World Kidney Day, the Pakistan National Heart Association (Panah) has raised the alarm over the devastating health crisis fueled by excessive consumption of sugary drinks in Pakistan.\n\nThe increasing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney disorders has reached an alarming level in Pakistan. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), NCDs account for 60pc of all deaths in Pakistan, with diabetes alone affecting over 33 million Pakistanis. Research indicates that excessive sugar intake, primarily from sugary drinks, is a leading cause of chronic kidney diseases.\n\nAccording to reports, the prevalence of chronic kidney diseases in Pakistan ranged from 12.5pc to 29.9pc. According to the WHO data published in 2020, kidney diseases deaths in Pakistan reached 56,796. At a press conference, Panah urged the government to take decisive action by imposing higher taxes on sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) to safeguard public health.\n\nSquadron Leader Ghulam Abbas, a representative of Pakistan Kidney Welfare Association, said kidney diseases were on the rise in Pakistan with thousands of patients requiring dialysis annually. The excessive consumption of sugary drinks significantly increases the risk of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, and hypertension. According to Kidney International, 12.86 million Pakistanis above 30 years of age were having some degree of renal impairment.\n\nPanah General Secretary Sanaullah Ghumman said that according to the WHO, NCDs accounted for 60pc of all deaths in Pakistan. Major cause of kidney diseases and NCDs was consumption of sugary drinks. The health burden of NCDs is not only costing lives but also draining Pakistan’s economy.\n\nAccording to the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE), Pakistan spends more than 2.6 billion dollars annually on healthcare expenditures related to diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and kidney and other NCDs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
