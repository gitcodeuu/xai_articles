He reiterated that the army act was meant only to maintain discipline within the ranks of the army.\n\nDefence Ministry counsel Khawaja Haris Ahmed, however, contended that the jurisdiction to determine where the PAA’s provisions would be applied rests only with parliament and was not the job of the judiciary. He said that judiciary should look at the constitution as a whole in its overall perspective, instead of considering certain clauses of the law.\n\nWhen Justice Mandokhail wondered if parliament could add more clauses to the PAA to bring civilians in the ambit of the law, the counsel replied this question was not before the court.\n\nJustice Mandokhail observed that Article 8(3)A of the constitution had exempted the enforcement of fundamental rights, but the question remains whether this exemption was only meant for the armed forces or could also be extended to civilians.\n\nThe counsel stated that Article 8(3)A was only meant for the armed forces, but civilians could be brought into it under certain circumstances.\n\nJustice Musarrat Hilali regretted that she was not getting the answer to her question despite the fact that the case was going on for the last one year. The judge asked: do military courts fall under the ambit of Article 175(3), which asks for the separation of executive from judiciary, and whether the military court is akin to the ordinary civilian court.\n\nThe counsel said he will answer it after satisfying the questions asked by other judges.\n\nThe CB then postponed further proceedings to April 7.\n\nSuper tax\n\nMeanwhile, senior counsel Makhdoom Ali Khan told a five-judge CB, hearing the imposition of the super tax, that the Supreme Court had earlier held that when a levy was not imposed as a common burden or implemented for a specific purpose then it cannot be called a tax.\n\nHeaded by Justice Aminuddin Khan, the CB had taken up a number of challenges by different taxpayers assailing the constitutional vires of the amended Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, which had been implemented for the tax year 2023.\n\nMr Makhdoom, who represents various companies, cited the latest judgement in the Income Support Levy case. This verdict, he stated, is not a standalone judgement since there were several other cases in which the apex court had expressed the same view.\n\nIn order to qualify for a tax on income under Entry 47 of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution, it must be for a general purpose and imposed as a common burden. The super tax was introduced by the PML-N government in 2015 which was applied to wealthy individuals, associations of persons, and companies earning above Rs500 million.\n\nThe government levied a tax rate of 4 per cent on the income of banking companies and 3pc on other sectors, which is still intact.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
