No prior consultation was done with the relevant stakeholders, including the power regulator Nepra, the Federal Board of Revenue and the Ministry of Finance.\n\nThe division claimed the summary had been circulated to Nepra, the Ministry of Industries and the National Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (Neeca). However, their views and comments could not be secured due to the urgency of the matter.\n\nThe ECC allowed the Power Division to issue policy guidelines to Nerpa for “revision of buyback rate from national average power purchase price to Rs10 per unit” for now and from time to time in future.\n\nThe settlement mechanism shall be made “in such a way that imported and exported units would be treated separately for billing. The units exported shall be bought at the approved buyback rate (Rs10), and the imported units would be billed at the applicable peak/off-peak rates”.\n\nIn addition, in case the total amount of bills against the units exported by the net metering consumers exceeds the total amount of bills against the units imported, the net amount shall be credited to the consumers in the subsequent billing cycle without any provision for consumers to encash those credited units.\n\nRegulatory adjustments\n\nNepra will be required to set a cap on the hosting capacity of each distribution transformer and feeder. It would also be required to set standards for inverters that facilitate real-time grid interaction, including voltage and frequency regulation and support communication interfaced with Discos with Wi-Fi, GSM, etc.\n\nThe Power Division highlighted the pressing need for regulatory adjustments, citing a record decline in solar panel prices that has led to a sharp increase in the number of solar net-metering consumers.\n\nAs of December 2024, solar net-metering consumers had transferred a burden of Rs159bn to grid consumers, a figure expected to rise to Rs4.24 trillion by 2034 without timely amendments.\n\nThe ECC was informed that the number of solar net-metering consumers surged significantly, reaching 283,000 by December 2024, up from 226,440 in October 2024.\n\nThe ECC also approved a summary of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs regarding the export of potassium sulphate fertiliser from Gwadar Port and allowed an exemption for Agven Private Ltd, operating in the Gwadar North Free Zone, to export up to 10,000 tonnes annually or 50pc of actual production, whichever is lower, until Dec 31, 2025.\n\nThe decision meant supporting the development of the Gwadar Free Zone while ensuring regulatory oversight through biannual shipment limits and data monitoring mechanisms.\n\nThe ECC approved about Rs1.2bn worth of five supplementary grants, including Rs250 million to the Ministry of Federal Education, Rs220m to the Ministry of Industries for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), Rs36.1m to the Ministry of Interior for helicopter maintenance for Sindh Rangers, Rs15m for helicopter maintenance for Frontier Corps Balochistan, and Rs670m for Sustainable Development Goals spending in Islamabad.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
