  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has withdrawn its decision to slash match fees for players participating in the National T20 Cup, which begins on Friday at the Iqbal Stadium, Faisalabad.\n\nThe PCB had recently reduced match fees from Rs 40,000 to Rs 10,000 without any official announcement, drawing discontent from domestic cricketers. However, on Thursday, PCB chairman Mohsin Naqvi intervened, rejecting the decision and directing the board’s domestic cricket department to reassess the matter.\n\nWhile the PCB has yet to officially disclose the revised amount, sources indicate it has been set at Rs 30,000 per match — Rs 10,000 less than last year.\n\nMeanwhile, defending champions Karachi Region Whites will take on Islamabad Region in the opening fixture, followed by Bahawalpur Region’s clash against Dera Murad Jamali Region at the same venue.\n\nA total of 18 teams, representing 16 regions, will compete in the tournament, which will be staged across Faisalabad, Lahore, and Multan. Lahore will host matches at the Gaddafi Stadium and the LCCA Ground, while Multan Cricket Stadium will also be a venue for the event.\n\nThe tournament’s group stage will see teams divided into four groups, with the top two sides from each progressing to the quarter-finals, scheduled for March 23 and 24 in Faisalabad.\n\nThe semi-finals will be played at the same venue on March 26, followed by the final on March 27, where the champions will pocket Rs five million, while the runners-up will receive Rs 2.5 million.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
