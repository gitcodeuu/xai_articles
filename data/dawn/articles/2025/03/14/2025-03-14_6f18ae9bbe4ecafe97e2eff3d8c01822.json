Describing the terrorist acts as part of a larger conspiracy against the nation, he said that all the institutions and forces were working together to confront that challenge.\n\nThere was no room for terrorism anywhere in the country, he said and urged all political parties to unite on a common platform to tackle that issue.\n\nHe announced that the MQM-P would soon convene an APC and also raise questions with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to address the issue of terrorism on the national level.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
