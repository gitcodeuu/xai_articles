More than 50 families gathered at Krishna Temple in Saddar and Priest Jai Ram led the religious rituals of the day.\n\nYoung and old alike came out and splashed colours on each other. The function started with prayers (Pooja) of Krishna, Ram, Durga and Hanuman. The celebrations were followed by distribution of sweets and fruits.\n\nBefore the function, the Hindu community prayed for the prosperity of the country and countrymen. They prayed that the festival of colours may bring peace, prosperity and brotherhood.\n\n“Though breaking of an earthen pot full of milk and cream is associated with the birthday of Lord Krishna, this time we hanged the earthen pot full of colours as Lord Krishna also celebrated the Holi this way,” said Sardar Heera, chairman of Pakistan Hindu-Sikh Social Welfare Council, while talking to Dawn.\n\nHe said the Hindu community living in the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad arrived at Krishna Mandir to celebrate Holi. Throwing colours on each other was to celebrate the spring season and end differences within the community.\n\nPriest Jai Ram explained that Hindus celebrated Holi, which is one of the biggest festivals in the Hindu calendar. He said Holi symbolised the victory of good over evil, and colours were thrown at each other as a sign of celebration and victory of God.\n\nHe said there was a Raja namely Hiranyakashipu in Multan who presented himself as god before the people. However, his son Prahad refused to admit him as a god. He said Prahad was a staunch devotee of Vishnu. The Raja asked his sister Holika, who was believed to have been gifted with the power that she would not burn when she wore her clock, to carry Prahad into the great fire lit for the purpose. However, Holika was burnt and Prahad escaped due to the blessings of Hindu god Vishnu.\n\nDue to this great escape, the Hindus throughout the world celebrate Holi. Jai Ram said the tradition of playing with colours on Holi draws its roots from a legend of Radha and the Hindu god Krishna as both also celebrated this festival.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2025",
