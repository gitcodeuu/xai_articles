The Houthis “targeted Ben Gurion airport... with a ballistic missile... and a military target” south of Tel Aviv, their military spokes­man Yahya Saree said.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, the Israeli military said it intercepted two missiles launched from Yemen “prior to crossing into Israeli territory” after it activated air raid sirens across multiple areas, including Jerusalem. Saree said the rebels also “targeted hostile warships in the Red Sea, including the American aircraft carrier (USS Harry S) Truman,” which he said was “in retaliation to the ongoing US aggression.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2025",
