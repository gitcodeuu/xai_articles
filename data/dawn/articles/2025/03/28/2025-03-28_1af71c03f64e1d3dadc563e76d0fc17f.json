  "content": "NAPIER: After a gap of more than seven years, Pakistan play a One-day International in New Zealand when both the teams clash in the first game of a five-match ODI series in Napier on Saturday.\n\nThe Mohammad Rizwan-captained tourists will look to turn the tables after the country’s T20 side suffered a 4-1 loss in the preceding series.\n\nThe Green shirts last played an ODI in New Zealand in 2018 at Wellington. This game was part of a five-match series in which the Sarfraz Ahmed-led tourists were whitewashed.\n\nLooking at the head-to-head ODI record during the past two years, both the teams have won six matches each. Interestingly, eleven of these games were held in Pakistan, while one was staged in India during the 2023 World Cup.\n\nNew Zealand of late have dominated Pakistan in ODIs, winning three matc­hes — all of which were held in Pakistan — in the tri-nation series and the ICC Champions Trophy held last month.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) added fast bowler Haris Rauf and wicket-keeper/batter Usman Khan to the ODI squad.\n\nRight-armer Haris remained the pick of the bowlers for Pakistan throughout the T20 in New Zealand picking eight wickets at an impressive average of 12.25.\n\nRight-handed batter Usman has been added to the touring squad as a reserve wicket-keeper. Usman was part of the T20 squad, he could not get a single game in the series.\n\nEight players from Pakistan’s T20 squad joined the ODI squad in Napier.\n\nThe players who have joined the touring party included Salman Ali Agha, Haris, Khushdil Shah, Irfan Khan Niazi, Abrar Ahmed, Sufiyan Muqeem, Mohammad Ali and Usman.\n\nLATHAM RULED OUT OF SERIES\n\nNew Zealand stumper-batsman Tom Latham was ruled out of the ODI series against Pakistan with a hand injury on Thursday leaving Michael Bracewell to continue as the side’s captain.\n\nWith regular white-ball captain Mitchell Santner busy in the Indian Premier League, Bracewell led New Zealand to a 4-1 victory in a T20 series against Salman Ali Agha-led Pakistan.\n\nLatham was due to lead New Zealand in the ODI series, but he fractured his hand while batting in the nets and will require at least four weeks to recover, the New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said in a statement.\n\nOpener Will Young, meanwhile, will miss the last two ODIs to be with his wife as they await the birth of their first child. He will be replaced by 23-year-old Canterbury batter Rhys Mariu, who has been called into the international set-up for the first time.\n\n“It’s obviously disappointing to lose Tom as captain on the eve of the series and we wish him a speedy recovery,” New Zealand head coach Gary Stead said. “The side is in safe hands with Michael, who’s done a great job through the T20I series.”\n\nStead added, “Finally, we wish Will and his wife Elise all the best next week as they await their first child, which is such a special and important time for them.”\n\nHenry Nicholls will return from a calf strain to replace Latham, while Mitch Hay will keep wickets. Canterbury batsman Rhys Mariu earned his maiden call-up as a batting cover.\n\n“We’ve had to be flexible this tour with numerous players unavailable for different reasons,” Stead said.\n\n“What it does do is offer opportunities to others players and it’s nice to introduce Rhys into the environment for the first time, as well as welcome back Henry.”\n\nDespite returning to the international stage for the just-ended five-match T20 series against Pakistan, Finn Allen, Tim Seifert and Jimmy Neesham have not been selected for the ODI rubber.\n\nNZC has confirmed that with more than two years until the next 50-over World Cup, selection criteria will be given to those on national and domestic central contracts.“With a group of regular ODI players unavailable, we have a selected group of high-potential players who are now ready for opportunities at international level,” chief selector Sam Wells said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2025",
