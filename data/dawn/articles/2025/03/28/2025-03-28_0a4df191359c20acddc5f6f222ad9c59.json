It declared that the clarification and the letter were ultra vires, issued without lawful authority and incompatible with constitutional guarantees.\n\nThe department was ordered to restore the petitioner’s appointment with all back benefits.\n\nConcerned at language\n\nThe SC expressed concern over the language used in the impugned judgement, particularly the phrase “a married daughter becomes a liability of her husband”.\n\nSuch language is not only factually and legally erroneous but also deeply patriarchal, reinforcing outdated stereotypes that are fundamentally incompatible with constitutional values.\n\nIt assumes that a woman’s identity, legal capacity, personhood, and entitlement to support are subsumed into that of her husband upon marriage, treating her as a dependent rather than an autonomous, rights-bearing individual, the SC judgement said.\n\nThe use of gender-biased language by judicial or administrative bodies does not merely reflect prevailing social prejudices, it also legitimises structural discrimination and risks encoding bias into the law itself.\n\nGlobally, it has been recognised that the language of judicial reasoning plays a critical role in shaping, affirming, or undermining substantive equality, the judgement said, adding that as constitutional subjects, women were entitled to equality not only in result but also in the form, tone, and respect with which the law addresses them.\n\nIn this context, the Feminist Judgments Project undertaken in several jurisdictions, including Pakistan, has demonstrated how judicial reasoning can be reframed through a feminist lens, applying existing legal principles while eschewing gendered assumptions and incorporating inclusive, equality-affirming language, Justice Shah observed.\n\nInternship programme\n\nMeanwhile, the SC has announced that it “does not sponsor any seasonable internship for students of any institution, including Harvard Law School”.\n\nThe announcement said this is to caution the students to remain careful and report to the Registrar office if anyone comes across such malicious programme, also clarifying that the SC runs a yearly internship programme which was conducted through a proper process and handled by a Committee of senior Supreme Court judges.\n\nOther than this, the SC does not sponsor nor own any internship programme, it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2025",
