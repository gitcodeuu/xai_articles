  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Committee on Medical Education Reforms, constituted by the prime minister and headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, on Thursday decided to impose a cap on the annual tuition fee for private medical and dental colleges at Rs1.8 million for MBBS and BDS programmes.\n\nAt present, medical colleges have been receiving fees of up to Rs 2.7m. The Pakistan Association of Private Medical and Dental Institutions (PAMI) has rejected similar fee capping proposals in the past, claiming it was not viable for them to continue medical education in colleges under such proposals.\n\nThe key participants of the meeting were Dr Tariq Bajwa (co-chair), Mustafa Kamal, Dr Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, Nadeem Mahbub, Prof Dr Rizwan Taj, Prof Dr Masud Gondal, Prof Dr Muhammad Iqbal, Prof Dr Mahmud Aurangzeb, Dr Riaz Shabaz Junjua, Dr Ghazanfar Ali and Dr Adil H. Haider.\n\nThe issue of rising tuition fees in private medical colleges has been a subject of ongoing concern for the public, students, and parents alike.\n\nIncreasing tuition fees raise alarm among students and parents\n\nThe PMDC Council previously addressed these concerns in its meetings on June 4, 2022, Dec 10, 2023, and Feb 23, 2024. A sub-committee, led by Prof Dr Masood Gondal, was also formed in response to the council’s decision on Feb 27, 2025, to resolve the issue of excessive fee increase.\n\nThe sub-committee, after conducting the thorough analysis over three meetings, consulted stakeholders, including representatives from private institutions and PAMI for comprehensive feedback on the matter.\n\nAfter evaluating the financial data and justifications provided by the institutions and based on the recommendations of the sub-committee, the Committee on Medical Education Reforms determined that the annual tuition fee for private medical and dental colleges should be capped at Rs1.8 million, with annual increase only based on the CPI inflation rate, applicable for five years for MBBS programme and four years for BDS programme. This fee structure will be publicly declared and enforced, ensuring transparency in the tuition fee determination process.\n\nHowever, institutions that believe their financial needs require a higher fee of up to a maximum of Rs2.5m will be allowed to submit a detailed financial justification to the PMDC in this regard.\n\nThe justification must include a breakdown of the costs driving the need for higher fee, evidence of additional educational services or facilities offered to students and a comparison with other institutions adhering to the standard fee structure.\n\nThe committee emphasised that only justified increases will be entertained to maintain fairness and to ensure that medical education remains affordable for the people.\n\nThe committee acknowledged the need for private institutions to maintain financial sustainability while ensuring the delivery of best quality education.\n\nAn official of the health ministry, wishing not to be named, said that the implementation will remain a challenge for the ministry and the PMDC.\n\nPrivate colleges are already charging up to Rs3 million from a first year MBBS student.\n\nFederal Health Minister Mustafa Kamal on Thursday directed the PMDC to conduct an independent third-party audit to ensure impartiality. Furthermore, he said the selection of auditors must be carried out through an open and competitive process by giving advertisements in newspapers.\n\nHe was visiting the PMDC where he got a briefing from the Council’s President, Dr Rizwan Taj.\n\nThe minister emphasised the importance of transparency and accountability in PMDC’s administrative and financial matters. He said the PMDC is a key institution and its decisions and actions have a direct impact on human lives.\n\n“We must always remain mindful of our accountability before God and consider public service as an act of devotion,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2025",
