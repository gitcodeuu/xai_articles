  "content": "LAHORE: Former hockey Olympians Manzoor-ul-Hasan Senior and Tauqir Dar have called on the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) to take immediate steps to secure the national team’s participation in the upcoming Azlan Shah Cup, set to begin in Ipoh, Malaysia on November 22.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Manzoor-ul-Hasan expres­sed uncertainty about whether the Malaysian Hockey Federation (MHF) failed to extend an invitation or if the PHF chose not to accept it.\n\nHowever, he emphasised that the tournament presented a unique opportunity for the PHF to field a team, particularly by incorporating young players to gain valuable practice ahead of the World Junior Cup in India later this year.\n\nTauqir lamented Paki­stan’s absence, calling it detrimental both to the country’s hockey prospects and the tournament itself.\n\n“Pakistan has traditionally been a regular participant in the Azlan Shah Cup, finishing as runners-up last year after a final loss to Japan,” he noted. “With India participating, the Pakistan-India match would attract immense global interest. It could significantly benefit the sport.”\n\nOther top-ranked teams in the tournament include Belgium, Germany, Ireland, and Malaysia, with Canada, ranked 21st in the world, rounding out the line-up.\n\nTauqir pointed out the potential advantages for Pakistan’s team, stressing the importance of competing against high-ranking teams.\n\n“This would provide a fantastic learning opportunity for our players. Personally, I would love to see a Pakistan-India clash at the Azlan Shah Cup. I am surprised that the Malaysian Hockey Feder­ation did not invite Pakistan, given the strong relationship between the two countries’ hockey federations,” he said.\n\nThere were unconfirmed reports suggesting Malaysia withheld the invitation due to unpaid past dues by the PHF, but the PHF secretary general rejected these claims in a press conference on Wednesday.\n\nBoth Manzoor and Tauqir urged the PHF to approach the International Hockey Federation (FIH) and the Asian Hockey Federation to resolve the issue and ensure Pakistan’s participation.\n\n“We missed the opportunity to compete in the FIH Pro League, which would have given us a chance to play against top-ranked teams. The Azlan Shah Cup is another valuable opportunity that must not be overlooked,” Tauqir remarked.\n\nManzoor added that the tournament would be an excellent platform to evaluate both senior and junior players as they prepare for upcoming events like the World Senior Qualifiers, Junior Cup, and the Asia Cup.\n\n“The PHF should explore all avenues to secure the entry, especially given the friendly relations between Pakistan and Malaysia in hockey,” he concluded.\n\nThe PHF secretary general, in his press conference, had also mentioned that he had been in touch with FIH President Tayyab Ikram, who is also Pakistani, to assist in securing an invitation for Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2025",
