Earlier the ministry said an “Israeli enemy strike on a car in Yohmor al-Shaqeef led to the death of three people,” in a statement reported by the National News Agency.\n\nThe news agency said a drone targeted a vehicle near the town, in a strike that came at the same time as artillery shelling.\n\nThe Israeli military said in a statement that “several Hezbollah terrorists were identified transferring weapons in the area of Yohmor in southern Lebanon”, adding that the army “struck the terrorists”.\n\nNNA also reported that “one person was killed and another wounded in the Israeli drone targeting… of a car in the (southern) town Maaroub”. The Israeli military said that overnight, the air force “struck and eliminated… a battalion commander” in Hezbollah’s elite Radwan Force in the Derdghaiya area, near Maaroub.\n\nIt accused him of having “advanced and directed numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians” and troops during the war, and of also directing “terror attacks against Israel’s Home Front” in recent months.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2025",
