The system could be improved with 100 per cent digitalisation, third-party validation and continuous monitoring, he added.\n\nThe premier emphasised that full action should be initiated against those officers and personnel who were involved in any kind of misappropriation.\n\nEncouragement of those who performed well should be ensured, he continued.\n\nThe prime minister was also briefed on tax cases pending decisions in courts as well as the steps taken for the recovery of money through these cases.\n\nThe FBR chairman informed the meeting about the reforms of bureau’s directorate of law, a digital algorithm for tax assessment, performance of tax officers and FBR’s overall reforms.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 23rd, 2025",
