  "content": "LAHORE: Lahore-bound Mianwali Express escaped a major accident late on Friday night after buffer of one of the passenger coaches broke on the way, leaving the railway officials with no option but to stop the train to fix the issue.\n\nAccording to sources, the train was on its way to Lahore smoothly with a number of passengers. But when it reached near Kundian station, its one of the economy class coaches bearing No. 12353 faced breaking of the buffer — a vital part that connects the coach with next and following coaches.\n\nThe train at Kundian station was inspected thoroughly and finally, this coach was detached from other coaches. The passengers travelling in this coach were accommodated in other coaches.\n\nThe sources said breaking of buffer during journey is not a minor thing; had it not been noticed and checked, the train would have parted in two portions during journey. And it might have led to a major accident on the way to Lahore, they said.\n\nCOMPLETED: The Lahore Development Authority claimed on Saturday to have completed sifting of the files of as many as 90,000 properties/plots situated in its various housing schemes, including Johar town, according to a spokesman.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 23rd, 2025",
