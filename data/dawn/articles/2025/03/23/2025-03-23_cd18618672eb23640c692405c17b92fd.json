  "content": "RAWALPINDI: A top office-bearer of the Rawalpindi Chamber of Commerce and Industry (RCCI) has expressed serious concerns over the abrupt changes in the net metering policy, terming them a major obstacle to the promotion of the renewable energy sector.\n\nRCCI Acting President Khalid Farooq Qazi in a statement called on the government to immediately withdraw these measures which he described as unfair and detrimental to both consumers and the country’s energy future.\n\n“It is completely incomprehensible to force solar energy consumers to purchase electricity at over 550 per cent higher rates from the national grid. This move is not only unjust but also unacceptable,” declared Mr Qazi.\n\nHe further criticised the decision to impose an additional charge of 90 paisa per unit on non-solar consumers under the guise of policy adjustments, calling it “highly deplorable.”\n\nThe RCCI acting president urged the government to review its decision and prioritise long-term, sustainable energy solutions that serve the interests of all categories of consumers, rather than benefiting only a select few.\n\n“The development of the renewable energy sector is crucial for Pakistan’s energy security, economic growth, and environmental stability,” he added.\n\nThe business community has also called on the government to engage with relevant stakeholders, including traders and industry representatives, to devise a balanced and comprehensive energy policy. Such a policy, they emphasised, should encourage the growth of renewable energy while safeguarding the interests of all power consumers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 23rd, 2025",
