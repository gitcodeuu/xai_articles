Activities have already begun at the district and provincial levels and hopefully, the number of dengue cases will be fewer this year than last year’s,” he said.\n\nDr Manzoor said that a provincial advisory group for DAP’s implementation had been notified but strengthening collaboration with MTIs was required as most patients were recorded there.\n\nHe said that dengue prevention was possible through public awareness, so the health department had been working to scale up people’s knowledge of the causes of the disease and ways to prevent it.\n\nThe official said that measures had been taken to implement NIH’s guidelines for effective preventive measures against dengue, early surveillance and prioritisation of rapid response protocols along with adherence to standard operating procedures for mosquito larval elimination, public awareness campaigns, and prompt case reporting to reduce outbreak risks.\n\nHe said the NIH advisory outlined comprehensive guidelines for proactive mobilisation of teams, rigorous monitoring of high-risk zones and timely case reporting to provincial directorate to facilitate timely detection of potential outbreaks.\n\n“We have shared the advisory with all district health officers, hospital medical superintendents and MTI directors for immediate dissemination across healthcare facilities,” he said.\n\nThe first dengue outbreak in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was reported in 2015 when 1,397 residents were infected with the vector-borne disease, according to official figures.\n\nThe next year, the number of infections dropped to 998 but in 2017, the province witnessed the worst outbreak, which killed 69 people and affected 26,343 people, mostly in Peshawar.\n\nDengue continued to hit the province afterwards as 1,022 cases were detected in 2018, 7,082 in 2019 and 60 in 2020. However, it killed 10 people and affected 10,615 people in 2021. Deaths totalled 18 the next year with the tally of cases surging to22,960.\n\nHowever, the number of cases dropped to 747in 2023with no death recorded. In 2024, only 117 dengue cases and zero mortality were reported.\n\nOfficials of the health department attribute that “success” against dengue to proper coordination among all relevant departments, which, they said, led to reduction of production of mosquito, the carrier and transmitter of the virus.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 23rd, 2025",
