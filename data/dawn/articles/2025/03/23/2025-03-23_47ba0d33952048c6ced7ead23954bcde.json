I have ordered the military to respond accordingly,” Katz said.\n\nNNA said Israeli air strikes and shelling had targeted several areas of the south.\n\nOne strike killed two people including a girl in Touline, it reported after earlier saying Israeli strikes wounded two people several kilometres further east in the border village of Kfar Kila.\n\nUN ‘alarmed’\n\nThe United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon said it was “alarmed by the possible escalation of violence”. “We strongly urge all parties to avoid jeopardising the progress made, especially when civilian lives and the fragile stability observed in recent months are at risk,” it said.\n\nHezbollah has long had strongholds in south and east Lebanon, as well as south Beirut, but the war with Israel dealt the group devastating blows, including the killing of longtime chief Hassan Nasrallah.\n\nUnder the ceasefire, Hezbollah is supposed to pull its forces back north of the Litani River, about 30km from the Israeli border, and dismantle any remaining military infrastructure in the south.\n\nIsrael is supposed to withdraw its forces across the UN-demarcated Blue Line, the de facto border, but has missed two deadlines to do so and continues to hold five positions it deems “strategic”.\n\nIsrael has carried out repeated air strikes during the ceasefire, targeting what it said were Hezbollah military sites that violated the agreement.\n\nThe Lebanese army said it had dismantled three makeshift rocket batteries in an area north of the Litani on Saturday.\n\nThe mayor of the Israeli border town Metula, across from Kfar Kila, urged the authorities to “act offensively and make it so that not one bullet is fired ever again at northern communities”. Metula was targeted by the rockets.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 23rd, 2025",
