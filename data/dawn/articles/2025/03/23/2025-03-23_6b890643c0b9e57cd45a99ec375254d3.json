  "content": "PESHAWAR: The additional advocate general, Noroz Khan, has drawn ire of provincial government for ‘not properly’ opposing a petition of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf central leader Mohammad Atif Khan in Peshawar High Court recently.\n\nOfficial sources said that Mr Noroz was asked to resign from his office.\n\nIn this connection, an audio message purportedly of provincial chief of Insaf lawyers Forum, the lawyers’ wing of PTI, Qazi Mohammad Anwar, is also making rounds on social media wherein he is informing Mr Noroz about the displeasure of Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur over the hearing in the said case which took place on March 12.\n\nMr Anwar could be heard asking Mr Noroz to resign from his office as the chief minister had asked him (Mr Anwar) that he should be sacked. He was telling him that for his face saving it would be better for him to resign.\n\nIssue highlights differences in ruling party\n\nInterestingly, another audio message, purportedly of Mr Noroz, also surfaced in which he was addressing Mr Atif that he had now been asked by Mr Anwar and the advocate general to resign. In the message, he is requesting Mr Atif that as he has been punished because of him, therefore, he may make a call to Mr Anwar and the AG and ask them as to why he (Noroz) has been targeted.\n\nSources in the party confirmed the authenticity of both the audio messages. The infighting within PTI, specially the rift between Mr Gandapur and Mr Atif, has no longer been a secret.\n\nLast year, KP anti-corruption establishment issued call-up notice to Mr Atif asking him to appear in an inquiry regarding alleged irregularities in Malam Jabba land lease and a Mardan private housing society.\n\nThe said notice was challenged by Mr Atif in Peshawar High Court, which granted him interim relief on Dec 10, 2024, and suspended the said call-up notice.\n\nThe present issue surfaced on March 12, when a bench consisting of Justice Mohammad Naeem Anwar and Justice Farah Jamshed, adjourned hearing of the petition.\n\nThe bench stated in its order, “learned counsel for the petitioner as well as learned AAG (additional advocate general) seek time as there is prospect of compromise between the parties.” The bench had also extended the stay order earlier issued in favour of the petitioner (Mr Atif).\n\nSources said that soon after the order was conveyed to the chief minister, he expressed annoyance over it following which the advocate general, Shah Faisal Uthmankhel, sought explanation from Mr Noroz.\n\nMr Noroz, in his reply, stated that the word ‘compromise’ was used by the petitioner’s side and not by him in the proceedings. He said that he was fully prepared for arguments in the instant petition but the petitioner’s counsel requested for adjournment on the basis of a prospect of compromise, which was accepted by the court.\n\nFurthermore, he said that he had never given any statement in favour of the petitioner inside or outside the court. “The undersigned is fully aware of his constitutional role being additional advocate general,” he added.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that Mr Atif in his petition has requested the high court to quash the notice and declare illegal to his extent all actions taken in consequence to the said notice including any inquiry or investigation.\n\nHe stated that as elected public representative, he had consistently been speaking against corruption and misconduct irrespective of political affiliation and openly criticised government actions whether from the opposition or from his own party.\n\nHe said the same reasons led to targeted actions against him even in his own province, where his political party held power. He added that in a blatant attempt to stifle his voice, the impugned notice was issued to him by ACE regarding the Malam Jabba land lease.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 23rd, 2025",
