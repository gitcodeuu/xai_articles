  "content": "US and Ukrainian officials were due to meet in Saudi Arabia on Sunday for talks on how to halt the Russian invasion, a member of the Ukrainian delegation told AFP, while the Kremlin warned of “difficult negotiations” and a long journey to peace.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is pushing for a rapid end to the three-year war and his envoy said on Sunday he expected “real progress” from the talks in Riyadh, which will see US officials hold separate discussions with delegations from Ukraine and Russia.\n\nDespite both sides proposing different plans for temporary ceasefires, attacks have continued unabated. A Russian strike on the Ukrainian capital killed three civilians overnight.\n\nOriginally scheduled to take place simultaneously in Saudi Arabia on Monday, the talks on a partial truce now look set to take place one after the other.\n\n“The meeting with the Americans is planned to take place tonight” in Riyadh, a Ukrainian source told reporters, including AFP.\n\nRussia’s negotiators said previously they would hold talks with the US side on Monday.\n\nTrump envoy Steve Witkoff voiced optimism that any agreement struck would pave the way to a “full-on” ceasefire.\n\n“I think you’re going to see in Saudi Arabia on Monday some real progress, particularly as it affects a Black Sea ceasefire on ships between both countries. And from that you’ll naturally gravitate to a full-on shooting ceasefire,” he told Fox News.\n\nBut the Kremlin on Sunday downplayed expectations of a rapid resolution, saying talks were just beginning.\n\n“We are only at the beginning of this path,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state TV. He said there were many outstanding “questions” and “nuances” over how a potential ceasefire might be implemented.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has rejected a joint US-Ukrainian call for a full and immediate 30-day pause, proposing instead a halt in attacks only on energy facilities.\n\n“There are difficult negotiations ahead,” Peskov said in the interview, published on social media.\n\nPeskov said Russia’s “main” focus in its talks with the United States would be a possible resumption of a 2022 Black Sea grain deal that ensured safe navigation for Ukrainian farm exports via the Black Sea.\n\n“On Monday, we mainly intend to discuss President Putin’s agreement to resume the so-called Black Sea initiative, and our negotiators will be ready to discuss the nuances around this problem,” Peskov said.\n\nMoscow pulled out of the deal — brokered by Turkey and the United Nations — in 2023, accusing the West of failing to uphold its commitments to ease sanctions on Russia’s own exports of farm produce and fertilisers.\n\nA senior Ukrainian official previously told AFP that Kyiv would propose a broader ceasefire, covering attacks on energy facilities, infrastructure and naval strikes.\n\nBoth sides launched fresh drone attacks on the eve of the negotiations. Ukrainian officials said a Russian drone attack killed three civilians in the capital Kyiv, including a five-year-old girl and her father.\n\nAFP reporters in the capital saw emergency workers treating the wounded in the early hours of Sunday in front of damaged residential buildings, hit in the strike. Deadly strikes on the well-protected capital are rarer than elsewhere in the country.\n\nUkraine’s air force said Russia launched 147 drones at the country in the latest barrage.\n\nZelensky urged his country’s allies to put fresh pressure on Russia. “New decisions and new pressure on Moscow are needed to bring an end to these strikes and this war,” he posted on social media on Sunday.\n\nRussia said it had repelled nearly 60 Ukrainian drones overnight. Officials said one man was killed in the southern Rostov region of Russia when his car was set alight by falling drone debris and a woman was killed in the Belgorod border region, also by a drone attack.\n\nUkraine’s army said it had captured a small village in the eastern Lugansk region, a rare battlefield success for Kyiv’s struggling army.\n\nMoscow heads into the Saudi talks amid a rapprochement with Washington under Trump that has boosted confidence in the Kremlin.\n\nPeskov said on Sunday that the “potential for mutually beneficial cooperation in a wide variety of spheres between our countries cannot be overstated”.\n\n“We may disagree on some things but that does not mean we should deprive ourselves of mutual benefit,” he added.",
