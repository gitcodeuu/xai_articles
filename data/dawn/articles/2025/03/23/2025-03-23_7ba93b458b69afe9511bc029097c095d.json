  "content": "WASHINGTON: The United States said it was terminating the legal status of hundreds of thousands of immigrants, giving them weeks to leave the country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has pledged to carry out the largest deportation campaign in US history and curb immigration, mainly from Latin American nations.\n\nThe order affects around 532,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans who came to the United States under a scheme launched in October 2022 by Trump’s predecessor Joe Biden and expanded in January the following year.\n\nThey will lose their legal protection 30 days after the Department of Homeland Security’s order is published in the Federal Register, which is scheduled Tuesday.\n\nThat means immigrants sponsored by the programme “must depart the United States” by April 24 unless they have secured another immigration status allowing them to remain in the country, the order says.\n\nWelcome.US, which supports people seeking refuge in the United States, urged those affected by the move to “immediately” seek advice from an immigration lawyer.\n\nThe Processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans (CHNV) programme, announced in January 2023, allowed entry to the United States for two years for up to 30,000 migrants per month from the four countries, which have grim human rights records.\n\nBiden touted the plan as a “safe and humane” way to ease pressure on the crowded US-Mexico border.\n\nBut the Department of Homeland Security stressed on Friday that the scheme was “temporary”. “Parole is inherently temporary, and parole alone is not an underlying basis for obtaining any immigration status, nor does it constitute an admission to the United States,” it said in the order.\n\nTrump last weekend invoked rare wartime legislation to fly more than 200 alleged members of a Venezuelan gang to El Salvador, which has offered to imprison migrants and even US citizens at a discount.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 23rd, 2025",
