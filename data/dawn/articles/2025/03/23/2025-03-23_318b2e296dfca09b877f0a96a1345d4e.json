He termed the youth an “asset of the nation” and urged the need to equip them with research-based education and the latest technological training.\n\nThe president said that Pakistan’s foreign policy was based upon ensuring stability and peace, adding that the country wanted strong ties with its neighbours and the international community based upon mutual respect and shared goals of prosperity.\n\nHe reiterated Pakistan’s solidarity with “Kashmiri brethren and sisters who had been bracing Indian atrocities” and reaffirmed that Pakistan would continue raising its voice at all global fora for the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination.\n\nHe also urged all provincial governments to focus on social welfare initiatives.\n\nThe military parade was attended by President Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, three services chiefs, top military brass, federal ministers, parliamentarians and members of the diplomatic corps.\n\nThe ceremony in Islamabad formally began with the national anthem. Fighter jets of the Pakistan Air Force presented a fly-past at the ceremony\n\nIn his earlier message to the nation, President Zardari had urged every Pakistani to rise above differences, reject division and negativity, and work together to build a prosperous, inclusive and just Pakistan, according to state-run Radio Pakistan.\n\nHe congratulated the entire nation and said that the same spirit that led to the creation of Pakistan can propel us toward a brighter tomorrow.\n\nThe president said the road ahead is challenging, but not impossible. He added that the true strength of Pakistan lies in its people, their resilience, hard work and patriotism that have carried this nation through the toughest of times.\n\nPresident Zardari emphasised that in today’s world, Pakistan must navigate complex realities, tackle economic pressures, and pursue sustainable development.\n\nPresident Zardari today is set to present national awards, which were announced for 104 Pakistanis and foreigners on Pakistan’s 78th Independence Day last year in recognition of their services, excellence, and sacrifices in their respective fields.\n\nMeanwhile, PM Shehbaz said that with the right policies, dedicated efforts, and national unity, Pakistan can achieve economic prosperity, uphold social justice, and secure its rightful place among the nations of the world.\n\nHe said this day stands as a defining moment in the history of South Asia’s Muslims.\n\nHe said that guided by the inspiring leadership of Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, they envisioned a state where Muslims could live with dignity, freedom, and self-respect — a land shaped by their aspirations and values.\n\nHe said this year Pakistan Day falls in Ramazan, which is a month of deep spiritual reflection, self-discipline, and renewed commitment to faith.\n\nThe premier said it is a time that reinforces our collective will and serves as a powerful reminder of the values of sacrifice and perseverance — principles embedded in our nation’s very foundation.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar said: “We pay tribute to and honour the unwavering and courageous efforts, vision, and determination of our ancestors that resulted in the establishment of an independent Pakistan.”\n\n“Pakistan is the identity we have forged through tremendous sacrifices. United as one nation, we vow to defend and safeguard it. I call upon my fellow Pakistanis to excel wherever you may be, your achievements represent Pakistan’s achievements,” he was quoted as saying in a statement posted on X by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nHe said: “Let us also honour the struggle and exceptional sacrifices of our Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their quest for the inalienable right to self-determination.”\n\nThe foreign minister also extended his greetings to Pakistanis living abroad and commended their patriotism.\n\nMeanwhile, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (CJCSC) General Sahir Shamshad Mirza and the services chiefs termed March 23, 1940 a “defining moment” in Pakistan’s history.\n\nIn a message issued by the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), they noted: “By the grace of Almighty Allah, our nation continues to progress under the banner of democracy, upholding the eternal principles of Islam.”\n\nExtending heartfelt congratulations to the nation on the 85th anniversary of Pakistan Day, the armed forces said the day “crystallised our collective vision and set the course for the creation of an independent homeland”.\n\n“With steadfast determination and divine guidance, Pakistan remains resolute in fortifying its democratic institutions and safeguarding the well-being of its citizens,” the statement asserted.\n\n“Rooted in faith, guided by hope, and strengthened by resilience, this occasion epitomises the unwavering resolve of the Pakistani people,” it highlighted.\n\nThe armed forces reaffirmed their “unwavering commitment to protecting our sacred frontiers and upholding the sovereignty of our beloved motherland”.\n\nThey noted that Pakistan stood as a responsible and resolute member of the global community — advocating peace, stability, and cooperation.\n\n“We shall continue to uphold and defend the peace that defines our national character, ensuring that Pakistan remains a beacon of harmony in the world. Pakistan is synonymous with peace, and we shall preserve and protect it — at all costs, Insha’Allah.”\n\nThe message concluded with “Pakistan Armed Forces Zindabad” and “Pakistan Paindabad”.",
