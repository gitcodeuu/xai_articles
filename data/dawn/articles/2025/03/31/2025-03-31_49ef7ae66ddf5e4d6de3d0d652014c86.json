  "content": "Muslims in several countries celebrated Eidul Fitr with prayers and gatherings, marking the end of Ramazan on Sunday.\n\nLike Ramazan and other Muslim observances, the timing of Muslim months and holidays generally depends on the lunar cycle, specifically the sighting of the Moon’s crescent following the new Moon.\n\nIn many parts of the world, dedicated teams of moon-sighters scanned the sky with telescopes and binoculars, hoping to catch a glimpse of the elusive crescent moon.\n\nAs every year, Eid was greeted with joy and excitement as Muslims marked with congregational prayers and festivities that typically include family visits, gatherings and new clothes. In Jerusalem, thousands of Palestinians gathered on Sunday at the Al Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City for prayers.\n\nIn Serbia, the Islamic community held its central Eid ceremony in the Arab mosque in Novi Pazar, also marking the occasion with communal prayers.\n\nIn the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, Muslims gathered in outdoor prayer spaces. Families donned new clothes and visited loved ones, blending tradition with modern festivities.\n\nIn Islam’s holiest city of Makkah, millions of pilgrims and locals joined in mass prayers at the Grand Mosque, underscoring the spiritual heart of the celebration.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
