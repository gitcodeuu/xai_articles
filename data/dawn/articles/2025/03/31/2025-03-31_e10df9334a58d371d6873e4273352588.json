The hospitals are overwhelmed, and it is very difficult for rescue teams to reach there.”\n\nMyanmar has been embroiled in a civil war since 2021 after the military staged a coup, and this is likely to complicate rescue operations. It has since put out a rare call for aid from any country.\n\nThough all her kin are unharmed, Ms Aung, 29, said she was worried and sad for her compatriots. She plans to donate money for aid.\n\nThe disaster on March 28 killed more than 1,600 people, injured over 3,400, and downed critical infrastructure in Myanmar. The figures are expected to jump, with the US Geological Survey estimating that the death toll could exceed 10,000, apart from severe economic losses.\n\nTremors were felt in Vietnam and China, while a state of emergency was declared in Thai capital Bangkok, where at least nine people died.\n\nMandalay, Myanmar’s second-largest city, lies close to the epicentre and was the worst hit. Ms Wilt Yee, who works as a cleaner in Singapore, has been posting near-constant updates on the precarious situation on Facebook for her friends and family in Mandalay.\n\nThe 39-year-old said she plans to give $1,000 to monasteries to help with relief work. Her friends here, including a Singaporean, have already passed her $300.\n\nMeanwhile, a caregiver based in Singapore said her father had dashed home from his workplace in Mandalay to look for her mother, who has walking difficulties. The woman, who declined to give her name and age, said her parents now have to cope with limited water and electricity supplies.\n\n“I wish I was back in Myanmar with my family. But I can only get updates through them,” she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
