  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Minister for Maritime Affairs Mohammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry on Sunday reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to climate-resilient initiatives aimed at protecting the nation’s coastal ecosystems.\n\nHe said key measures included mangrove conservation, marine pollution reduction, and sustainable port operations to align with global environmental goals.\n\nIn a statement on International Day of Zero Waste, the minister underscored the maritime sector’s pivotal role in environmental conservation. He highlighted the need for collaborative efforts to protect coastal regions while ensuring national policies align with international climate objectives.\n\nObserved annually on March 30, the day promotes sustainable consumption and production, advocating for waste reduction strategies. This year’s theme, “Towards Zero Waste in Fashion and Textiles”, highlighted the industry’s substantial environmental footprint with an estimated 92 million tonnes of textile waste produced globally each year.\n\nMinister stresses collaborative efforts to protect coastal regions\n\nAddressing the global waste crisis, the minister noted that approximately 2.1 to 2.3 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste were generated annually with projections reaching 3.8 billion tonnes by 2050 without intervention. Given that 95pc of Pakistan’s trade was conducted via maritime routes, the sector faces unique waste management challenges.\n\nThe minister outlined several steps taken by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs to curb environmental degradation. These include compliance with International Maritime Organisation (IMO)’s regulations on oil and garbage record-keeping, modernisation of port operations to reduce emissions and a gradual shift from heavy fuel oil to cleaner alternatives.\n\nMangrove conservation and plastic waste reduction in coastal regions remain a top priority, he said.\n\n“Over five million mangrove saplings have been planted in Sindh and Balochistan to combat coastal erosion and support biodiversity,” the minister stated.\n\nHe also emphasised the need for inter-ministerial coordination to align Pakistan’s maritime policies with international climate commitments. “Recent discussions between the ministry and the Climate Change Division had focused on integrating clean energy solutions into the maritime sector. Talks with Prime Minister’s Climate Change Coordinator Romina Khurshid Alam explored collaborative efforts in marine biodiversity conservation and climate adaptation strategies for fisheries and port infrastructure.”\n\nHe said as part of its sustainability agenda, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs was prioritising infrastructure upgrades, including elevated expressways to streamline port connectivity, modernised cargo handling systems and a long-term policy framework to attract investment in eco-friendly maritime technologies. Digital ship registration and automated port operations were also being explored to enhance efficiency and reduce environmental impact.\n\nThe minister called on stakeholders to adopt circular economy principles, stressing that sustainable maritime practices were crucial for economic growth and environmental security.\n\n“As we observe Zero Waste World Day, we reaffirm our commitment to transforming Pakistan’s maritime sector into a global model of sustainability. Together, we can protect our oceans, safeguard coastal livelihoods, and ensure a resilient future for generations to come,” the minister said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
