  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (Drap) has intensified its efforts to combat the illegal sale, manufacturing and distribution of spurious and falsified therapeutic goods.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the health ministry, Drap and provincial health authorities executed enforcement actions resulting in substantial seizures, sealing of premises, and legal proceedings, over the past two weeks.\n\nIn Lahore, it claimed to have apprehended individuals illegally selling ‘Urografin 76pc Injection’, leading to confiscations and charges for violations, including unlicensed sales and overpricing, with ongoing investigations. It is worth mentioning that Urografin is an injectable contrast medium which contains iodine. It is used to clearly show on X-rays the area of the human body.\n\nA Drap-led team in Lahore intercepted a dealer selling unregistered ‘Lipiodol Ultra Liquid’ [used in women undergoing infertility] near the Hameed Latif Hospital. It subsequently raided M/s Al-Waali Distributors, recovering illicit articles, sealing the premises, and initiating a formal investigation.\n\nLegal proceedings initiated against multiple individuals\n\n“Drap has also taken decisive action against the illegal manufacturing of unregistered medical devices in Islamabad. Authority conducted a surprise inspection at a facility in the Industrial Triangle, Kahuta Road, (which) revealed the unlawful production and storage of plastic urine collection containers without the mandatory Establishment License, a clear violation of the Medical Devices Rules 2017, and the DRAP Act 2012. The illegally manufactured devices were seized, and the facility was sealed,” the statement revealed.\n\n“Similarly, an operation at a former pharmaceutical facility, M/s Ambro Pharmaceuticals, in the same area, uncovered the illegal manufacturing and storage of medical devices despite the prior cancellation of its Drug Manufacturing License. The premises were sealed, and the owner has been referred for stringent legal action,” the ministry claimed.\n\nIn a move to protect the pharmaceutical industry and the public, Drap has issued an urgent alert regarding the presence of falsified Propylene Glycol (PG) in the market. A test by the Drug Testing Laboratory (DTL), Lahore, confirmed a dangerously high level of toxic Ethylene Glycol (EG) in the batch number YF01210911.\n\n“Drap remains resolutely committed to eradicating spurious and falsified therapeutic goods through rigorous surveillance, intelligence-led enforcement, and stringent regulations. Public vigilance is vital; citizens are strongly urged to report any suspicious activity related to potentially counterfeit or substandard medicines and medical devices via Drap’s official channels. This collaborative approach is crucial for ensuring access to safe, effective, and quality therapeutic goods for all citizens,” it stated.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
