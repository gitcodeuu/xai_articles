Heroines namely Bisma Chohan, Jiya Butt, Reena Multani and Naleem Gul are also displaying their talent in the Eid flicks.\n\nThe trio of Eid releases are characterised by powerful music tracks and entrainment as the promos of the Pashto movies released online prior to Eid received huge response from audience. Filmmakers and directors said that movies failed to get success at box office. They added that Eid was the only occasion where cine goers got attention of the big screen and turn up in a large number.\n\nSocial media onslaught has affected the industry\n\nInvestors make tall claims of earning more business owing to quality production in line with modern digital demands of cinematography, storyline and music quality. Pashto cinema, also known as Pollywood, has a rich cultural heritage that reflects the traditions, values and history of Pashtuns.\n\nWith a history spanning over six decades, Pashto cinema has evolved into a unique and vibrant industry that showcases the beauty and diversity of Pashtun culture. The first Pashto film “Laila Majnu” was released in 1941. However, it was not until the 1950s and 1960s that Pashto cinema began to flourish. During this period, films like “Aalam Tangan” and “Zama Jora” became huge hits, establishing Pashto cinema as a major player in Pakistani film industry.\n\nThe 1970s and 1980s are considered the golden era of Pashto cinema. This period saw the rise of legendary actors like Badar Munir, Asif Khan and Yasmin Khan. Films like “Orbal” and “Gul Bakawli” became classics and the industry experienced a surge in popularity.\n\nIn recent years, Pashto cinema has undergone a significant transformation. The industry has seen the emergence of new talent and films like “Zakhmoona” and “Bazigar” have achieved critical and commercial success. The use of modern technology and innovative storytelling has helped Pashto cinema to stay relevant and fresh.\n\nPashto cinema plays a vital role in promoting Pashtun culture and values. The industry provides a platform for artists to express themselves and showcase their talent. Pashto films often focus on themes like love, honour and traditions.\n\nDespite its rich cultural heritage, Pashto cinema faces several challenges. The industry has struggled with funding and lack of infrastructure has hindered its growth. Additionally, the rise of social media onslaught and Western cinema has posed a significant threat to the industry.\n\nDespite facing several challenges, the industry remains a source of pride for Pashtuns and its legacy continues to inspire new generations of artists and filmmakers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
