  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan Railways (PR) Lahore headquarters recently witnessed an ugly incident when, after exchange of harsh words and abusive language, an officer entered the office of his senior following a meeting, where they scuffled with each other.\n\nThe PR’s senior engineers have condemned the incident, demanding the top officials to take action against Mr Tariq Latif, a BS-19 officer after a probe. They claimed that Latif attacked a senior officer, Additional General Manager-Mechanical Rahat Mirza (BS-20).\n\nAccording to some officers privy to the incident, the quarrel first occurred during a meeting in the office of the PR’s chief executive officer (CEO), discussing various operational issues.\n\n“The meeting was underway smoothly on Saturday (March 29), with a discussion on the resumption of the operation of Bolan Mail and Khushhal Khan Khattak Express trains. Mr Mirza was giving various options to the CEO regarding resumption of the trains’ operation,” says an official privy to the meeting, wishing anonymity, on Sunday.\n\n“Suddenly, Mr Latif, who was sitting there to discuss his repatriation to his parent department (railways) from the National Highway Authority (NHA) with the CEO, started questioning Mr Mirza, using inappropriate language. Mr Mirza and other officers tried to stop him, but he continued to misbehave and started using abusive language,” the officer explained.\n\nAccording to another officer, who was also present in the meeting, Mr Mirza later went to his office and telephoned Mr Latif to make him realise that his conduct was inappropriate. He said that hardly after 10 minutes or so, Mr Latif entered the office of Mr Mirza and again used abusive language, besides hurling threats of dire consequences at his senior.\n\n“It finally led to a scuffle, started by Mr Latif, who tore down Mr Mirza’s clothes, besides thrashing him, using kicks and fists. Mr Mirza also retaliated in his defence,” he said, adding that Mr Latif later left the office hurling threats.\n\nWhen contacted, Mr Tariq Latif, who also served as the PR’s Sukkhar division’s superintendent few years ago, dispelled the impression, alleging that Mr Mirza started the quarrel. “A discussion was underway in the meeting wherein he (Mr Mirza) started taunting me, saying that finally NHA kicked you out and sent back to the PR. I objected to it, requesting him to stop using such language,” Mr Latif claimed.\n\nAccording to him, finally the CEO intervened and the meeting went smooth afterwards. He said that after the meeting concluded, Mr Mirza went back to his office from where he telephoned me, using abusive language. “I wondered and stopped him from doing so, but he didn’t. Finally, I went to his office to ask why he misbehaved with me. At this, he (Mirza) flared up and tore my clothes. In my defence, I used my leg to push him away as he was holding me by collar,” he explained.\n\nTo a question, he said some officers don’t want him in railways as he always raised his voice against “wrongdoings” in the department. “I would prove him (Mirza) guilty in the inquiry if ordered by the CEO,” he added.\n\nWhile responding to Mr Latif’s accusations, Mr Mirza said everyone knows about a series of incidents wherein Mr Latif misbehaved and physically attacked officers, unnecessarily.\n\n“He suddenly intervened in the discussion and started using inappropriate language. All the officers including CEO stopped him, but he didn’t. Later, I went to my office and called him on phone. I asked him why he did this and requested him not to repeat such conduct in future. At this, he flared up, entered my office and attacked me physically. This is a shameful act and a criminal offence under the law. To a question, he said many officers witnessed the episode and they know well who is at fault. He added that he would soon submit a written complaint against Latif to the CEO.\n\nThe PR CEO confirmed the incident, stating that he would take action soon. “I will order an inquiry as soon as I receive a written complaint in this regard,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the PR engineers have expressed grave concerns over the incident, also criticising the railway administration for not taking any action despite passing of two days.\n\n“We urge the railways minister Mr Hanif Abbasi to order registration of a case against Mr Latif,” demands a press release issued by the engineers jointly. “We neither want to work with or under him (Latif), nor see him in railways,” it sought.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
