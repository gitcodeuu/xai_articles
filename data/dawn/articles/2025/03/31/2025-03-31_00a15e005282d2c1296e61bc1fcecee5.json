Three young girls killed in an air raid on al-Mawasi are seen in a verified footage bloodied and apparently wearing new clothes on the occasion of Eidul Fitr, the report added.\n\nHow much longer?\n\nEzzedine Mousa, a resident of Gaza City, described an overwhelming sense of fear gripping the region.\n\n“People are afraid to visit one another because a rocket could strike at any moment, claiming their lives,” he said.\n\n“Our children’s eyes reflect their fear, but we do our best to keep them happy with whatever little we have.”\n\nIsrael resumed its military campaign across Gaza on March 18, rattling a fragile weeks-long truce.\n\nSince then, more than 900 people have been killed across Gaza, according to the health ministry of the Hamas-run territory. Since October 2023, Israel in a blistering military campaign in Gaza killed at least 50,277 people, the majority of them women and children.\n\nRed Crescent members killed\n\nThe Palestine Red Crescent Society on Sunday confirmed 11 more bodies have been found in Gaza’s Rafah city, including six identified as its members and four as civil defence agency personnel, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nThe ambulance service said three of its medics and one civil defence responder ‘remain missing’.\n\nMedics and witnesses reported that Israeli air strikes continued in Khan Yunis and some other parts of Gaza throughout the day.\n\nAn air strike in Rafah wounded two children, according to medics.\n\n“The world rejoices in Eid while our sons and daughters lie in morgues. How much longer will this tragedy continue?” said Mohamed al-Qadi, who lost his sister and nephew in Sunday’s pre-dawn Israeli strike on Khan Yunis.\n\nEid of sadness\n\n“It’s the Eid of sadness,” said Adel al-Shaer in the central town of Deir el-Balah in Gaza, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nAl-Shaer said he lost 20 members of his extended family in Israeli strikes since the offensive on Gaza began, including four young nephews just a few days ago.\n\n“We lost our loved ones, our children, our lives, and our futures. We lost our students, our schools, and our institutions. We lost everything,” he added, breaking into tears.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 31st, 2025",
