  "content": "Niger’s government announced on Friday three days of mourning after 44 civilians were killed in the country’s southwest by “terrorists” belonging to the militant Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) group, AFP reports.\n\nThe victims were killed in a “savage” attack on a mosque in the Fambita quarter of the rural town of Kokorou, the interior ministry said in a statement broadcast on state television.\n\nIt said another 13 people were wounded.\n\nThe attack occurred early in the afternoon as people were attending a prayer service at the mosque, the ministry statement said.\n\n“The heavily armed terrorists surrounded the mosque to carry out their massacre with unusual cruelty,” it said, adding that the attackers also set fire to a local market and homes.\n\nThe ministry vowed to hunt down the perpetrators and put them on trial. The attack occurred in an area close to the borders with Burkina Faso and Mali — a region in which terrorists affiliated with the militant Islamic State group (IS) and Al-Qaeda have been active for years.\n\nThe military of Niger’s junta-run government frequently fights terrorists in the region, and civilians are often victims of the violence.\n\nSince July 2023, at least 2,400 people have been killed in Niger, according to the database of the Acled, a non-governmental organisation that gives armed conflict location and event data.",
