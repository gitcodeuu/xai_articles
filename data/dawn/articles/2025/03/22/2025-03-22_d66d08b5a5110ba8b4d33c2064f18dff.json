Both cases were admitted to the dermatology OPD at Khyber Teaching Hospital after doctors suspected them of having mpox symptoms, officials told Dawn.com.\n\nAdditionally, authorities stepped up screening and surveillance after detecting mpox in a woman in Bara tehsil of Khyber district last month. “It is the first case to be detected from the community,” officials told Dawn.com.\n\nMeeran Yousuf, the media coordinator for the Sindh health ministry, said in a statement today that the case was confirmed in a 29-year-old resident of Malir with no recent travel history.\n\n“His first symptom onset was on March 15, 2025,” she said. “The patient is currently in isolation at a public hospital and contact tracing is currently being conducted by the health department.”\n\nYousuf told Dawn.com that the Provincial Public Health Lab at Dow University’s Ojha campus confirmed the case. She added that the patient was undergoing treatment at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.\n\nMpox is a significant health problem that is killing some of the most vulnerable people in the world, including children, and a form of it is possibly spreading in new ways and new parts of Africa.\n\nThe World Health Organisation declared mpox, previously known as monkeypox, an emergency of international concern on August 14, 2024.",
