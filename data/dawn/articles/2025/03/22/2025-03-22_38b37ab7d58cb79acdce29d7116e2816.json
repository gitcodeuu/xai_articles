Three police cars gave chase.\n\nProsecutors said the driver had run a red light. “Three police vehicles then set off in pursuit of the vehicle for several kilometres,” the public prosecutor’s office said.\n\nProsecutors said they suspected the driver of being intoxicated at the time of the chase. The driver lost control of his vehicle and crashed into a traffic light, prosecutors said.\n\n“The three pursuing police vehicles then crashed into his vehicle,” added the Paris prosecutor’s office.\n\nAs a result of the accident in the 15th district, also in the south of the French capital, ten police officers received light injuries and were hospitalised, the prefecture said in a statement.\n\n“The driver and two passengers were arrested and taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries,” the statement said.\n\nThe UNSA-Police union posted a picture of the aftermath of the accident, with one police vehicle sitting on top of a badly damaged black car.\n\n“A chilling image that testifies to the violence of the accident that occurred in Paris,” the union said on X.\n\nParis police chief Laurent Nunez paid tribute to “all the police officers mobilised during this intervention”.",
