Due to a quick response by the police, the Fitna Al Khawarij escaped into the darkness.”\n\nFitna Al Khawarij is a term the state uses to refer to the banned TTP.\n\nThe attack occurred at 12:45am where the police “retaliated with courage and bravery”, the statement added.\n\nThe statement continued, “An exchange of fire took place … The police personnel were on high alert. Due to their timely action, the Fitna Al Khawarij were forced to flee, without causing any harm.”\n\nLakki Marwat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Jawad Ishaq appreciated the police personnel for thwarting the attack and “their excellent response”.\n\nThe incident follows a spate of attacks in the Peshawar, Karak, Bannu, Dera Ismail Khan, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur districts of KP this month.\n\nOn Monday, authorities said that cops managed to repel terrorist attacks on police stations and checkposts in Lakki Marwat and Peshawar districts.\n\nIn the early hours of March 17, Gambila police station in Lakki Marwat was targeted, but the Quick Response Force (QRF) opened fire in retaliation, causing the Fitna Al Khawarij to flee in the dark.\n\nIn another incident, unknown men had hurled a grenade at a checkpost in Peshawar’s Malazai area on Sunday night. However, no damage had occurred, according to Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Operations Masood Bangash.",
