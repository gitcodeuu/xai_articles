  "content": "KHYBER: Pedestrian movement between Pakistan and Afghanistan via the Torkham border remained suspended on Friday as authorities struggled to restore the immigration system, which was damaged during cross-border gunfire between security forces two weeks ago.\n\nOfficials confirmed that repairs to the immigration booths and offices were still incomplete and they would try to start operations on Saturday (today).\n\n“Our internet system and the waiting lounge for departing Afghans were both damaged in the crossfire. We are working to restore both facilities by late Friday evening to facilitate pedestrian movement,” a Federal Investigation Agency official said on condition of anonymity.\n\nA large number of Afghan nationals, including men and women, had gathered at Torkham and Landi Kotal since Thursday evening, waiting impatiently for the immigration booths to reopen.\n\nThe Torkham border was reopened on Tuesday after a 27-day closure due to a dispute between Pakistan and Afghanistan over the construction of a check post on the Afghan side.\n\nUnder an agreement between both sides, freight vehicles and critically ill Afghan patients were initially allo­wed to cross, with pedestrian movement to resume once Pakistan completed repairs on its immigration facilities.\n\nMeanwhile, Afghan transporters who were either stranded in Pakistan or had crossed into the country after the border reopening alleged that they were facing harassment from Khyber police on the main road leading to Torkham.\n\nThey claimed that police at multiple checkpoints from Peshawar to Torkham were demanding bribes, adding to their financial losses incurred during the nearly month-long closure of the border.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
