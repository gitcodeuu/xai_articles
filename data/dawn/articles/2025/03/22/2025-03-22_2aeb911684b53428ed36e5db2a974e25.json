  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges, chaired by Senator Taj Haider, issued a stern warning on Friday over the failure to implement the production order of detained PTI leader Senator Ejaz Chaudhry, emphasising potential consequences for non-compliance.\n\nThe committee in its meeting highlighted the urgent need to honour the sanctity of the house and its authority and uphold the rule of law.\n\nSenate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani did not preside over the recent Senate session to record his protest against non-imp­lementation of his orders regarding Sena­tor Chaudhry’s production in parliament.\n\nWhile taking up the matter of privile­ge motion referred to it by the house against Punjab’s Inspector General of Police (IGP) and Inspector General of Prisons for not implementing production orders issued by Senate chairman on Jan 13 and March 7, the committee decided to take an immediate action on the suspension of the superintendent jail and other relevant officers for violation of Rule 78 of Rules of Procedure and Privileges.\n\nHome secretary says medical clearance must for PTI senator’s production\n\nThe committee directed the Punjab authorities to immediately present Mr Chaudhry before Senate’s privileges committee if medical clearance by doctors and family consent to his participation were granted.\n\nSenator Chaudhry, who has been under medical care for a heart condition, was reportedly admitted to the Punjab Institute of Cardiology (PIC) after suffering heart pain on Feb 20.\n\nSenator Taj Haider stressed, “Not im­­p­­lementing the order of the Senate chairman is a serious privilege breach. The committee has the authority to take strict action against those who violate the due process. And this cannot be ignored.”\n\nWhile Punjab home department said there were no security concerns regarding Senator Chaudhry’s transportation, the IG prisons and IG police insisted they would not move Senator Chaudhry without medical clearance.\n\nThey assured the committee they would not create any hi­ndrance rather provide complete support if his medical requirement is cleared.\n\nOn the other hand, the Punjab authorities insisted that Senator Chaudhry remained admitted to the PIC and could not be moved.\n\nThe committee, however, questioned the validity of the claims, pointing out there was a lack of written confirmation from doctors about his inability to move.\n\nPunjab Home Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal said, “We respect the Senate or­­d­­­ers, but medical concerns are paramount. If Senator Chaudhry’s doctors clear him for movement, we will produce him.”\n\nApparently irked by the reply, Senator Raja Nasir Abbas said, “This is not just about health — it’s about respecting the rule of law. If people can travel for medical treatment, so can Senator Chaudhry.”\n\nSenator Sadia Abbasi emphasised that the Senate chairman’s authority had been undermined by non-compliance, stating, “The chairman had directed that Senator Ejaz Chaudhry should be presented. No one informed the chairman that it wasn’t possible to move him, which is a clear violation of privileges.”\n\nSenator Attaur Rehman questioned the political motives behind Senator Chaudhry’s extended hospitalisation. “We demand to know whether Ejaz Chaudhry is being deliberately kept away from the Senate proceedings for reasons unrelated to his health,” he said.\n\nThe committee chairman said, “We are prepared to take legal action under Rule 78 if the violation continues.”\n\nIn response to a query, the IG prisons confirmed to the committee that they facilitated Senator Chaudhry’s hospital visits, but stressed, “If Ejaz Chaudhry’s doctors approve his transfer, we will follow through immediately.”\n\nThe committee decided to formally write to Senator Chaudhry to confirm whether he was willing to attend the session, provided his health permits.\n\nThe committee made it clear that the failure to comply with Senate’s orders would not be tolerated. “The authorities must ensure that Senator Chaudhry is either presented as per the production order or be held accountable for their lack of action,” it said.\n\nThe Punjab authorities were directed to work closely with the medical team and Senate leadership to ensure that Senate’s dignity was upheld.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
