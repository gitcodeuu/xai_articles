  "content": "KARACHI: Proces­sions, rallies, conferences and seminars were held on Friday to express solidarity with the people of Palestine and condemn Israeli brutalities in Gaza.\n\nThe people who participated in the events condemned the ‘Zionist state’ for violating set rules of ceasefire and targeting unarmed innocent civilians.\n\nThe Jamaat-i-Islami took out a rally from Boat Basin to the US Consulate against Israeli atrocities and genocide in Palestine amid tight security and the closure of roads. Carrying banners and placards, a large number of protesters chanted slogans against Israel and the US. However, police stopped the rally from reaching the US Consulate after crossing M.T. Khan Road.\n\nHowever, some leaders of the protesters were allowed to proceed. DIG-South Asad Raza told Dawn that they submitted a “memorandum” to the consulate officials and dispersed peacefully.\n\nBoth tracks of Mai Kolachi and M.T. Khan Road were closed, said the DIG.\n\nA traffic police spokesperson in a statement said that because of the closure of Mai Kolachi and M.T. Khan Roads, the traffic was diverted to Dr. Ziauddin Ahmed Road and Club Road.\n\nA large number of road users faced hardship due to traffic jams on Dr. Ziauddin Ahmed Road and Club Road.\n\nIn his address, JI Karachi chief Monem Zafar lambasted Israel over the genocide in Gaza and also held the United States responsible for Israeli crimes.\n\nHe shed light on the history of the US regarding dropping atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\nThe JI leader also condemned the ruling elite in Pakistan for their “submission” to the US.\n\nMWM holds demos across city\n\nThe Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen observed Youm-i-Yakjehti Palestine and Yemen: Palestine and Yemen Solidarity Day.\n\nThe party organised protest demonstrations and rallies outside various mosques all over Sindh after Friday prayers.\n\nA large number of people participated in the rallies and raised their voice against brutalities in Palestine and Yemen.\n\nThe demonstrations were addressed by Allama Baqir Abbas Zaidi, Allama Sadiq Jafari, Mukhtar Imami, Allama Mubashir Hassan, and others.\n\nSpeaking at the main protest in Khawaja Mosque, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Sindh president Allama Baqir Abbas Zaidi said “Israel is a global terrorist and an occupying state”.\n\n“Despite the Palestinian-Israeli ceasefire agreement, Israel continues to target innocent civilians,” he said.\n\n“In recent Zionist attacks, hundreds of innocent people have been martyred. US bombings in Yemen have resulted in loss of dozens of civilian lives, most of whom were innocent children. Israel is committing war crimes, which is not a new phenomenon. After Hamas’ retaliatory attacks, a failing Israel is massacring innocent women, children, and civilians.”\n\nTLP rally\n\nThe Tehreek Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) staged a rally outside the Karachi Press Club.\n\nIn his addressing, TLP Karachi division chief Mufti Qasim Fakhri said that the catastrophe faced by the people of Gaza in Ramazan was a result of criminal silence of Muslim rulers.\n\nHe asked the government to take practical steps to support the people of Palestine.\n\n“Violation of ceasefire and genocidal bombing of Gaza is a war crime and Zionist terrorism,” he said.\n\n“Why is there no practical response by the Muslim world to stop bloodshed in Gaza? Why there is no solid strategy for liberation of the first Qibla? The rulers of the Islamic world should respect the sentiments of the Muslims across the world. It’s time for a unified response against the Israeli brutality.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
