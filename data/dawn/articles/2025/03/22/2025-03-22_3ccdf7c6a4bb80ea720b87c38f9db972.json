The day usually falls on March 21.\n\nUnesco inscribed Jashn-i-Nauroz in 2009 on its representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity, acknowledging its strength of unity.\n\nDG Khana-i-Farhang says ancient Iranian festival symbolises unity and peace\n\nAbout 3,000 years old festival, the ancient ritual has evolved over centuries into a fascinating event embraced by numerous ethno-linguistic and cultural communities around the world.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Dr Hossien Choqomi, director general Khana-i-Farhang, said Nauroz was an ancient Iranian festival symbolising unity, rebirth and peace. “The day is celebrated in over a dozen countries, including Iran, Afghanistan Turkiye, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Pakistan, and several central Asian countries in different ways.”\n\n“The event conveys a message of brotherhood and spirit of unity,” he said.\n\n“The best part of the festival is that people lay a tablecloth with Haft Mewa (seven fruits) to strengthen diversity among human communities for peace, justice and mutual respect. It’s a festival of sharing and caring besides a spiritual experience,” Dr Choqomi added.\n\nMeanwhile, an Afghan local residency called Darul Afghana located in Sardar Ahmad Jan Colony also observed Jashn-i-Nauroz, where family members and guests gathered and laid out a tablecloth having seven fruits and shared their thoughts.\n\nAbid Ghazi, a young poet, told Dawn that Afghan families had added to the diversity of the provincial capital through the celebration of this ancient event, drawing inspiration from their ancestors down the ages.\n\n“Most Persian and Pashto poets have mentioned Jashn-i-Nauroz in their verses, especially classical Pashto poet Khushal Khan Khattak, wrote poems on the annual event coinciding with advent of spring season. It is a shared legacy of human civilisation drenched in ancient cultural roots,” he said, and urged people to get together for peace, love and mutual harmony.\n\nIn Chitral, the Nauroz festival or locally called ‘pathakdik’ was celebrated with great pomp and show in the valleys of Garam Chashma, Arkari and Karimbabad in Lower Chitral and Yarkhun and Laspur in Upper Chitral.\n\nThe festival of Iranian origin, is celebrated as an event to herald the advent of spring season as the residents virtually confined themselves within their houses due to snow during the three months of winter season.\n\nThe houses are renovated and decorated on this occasion, while the people pass the time in merry-making and visit each other and exchange gifts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
