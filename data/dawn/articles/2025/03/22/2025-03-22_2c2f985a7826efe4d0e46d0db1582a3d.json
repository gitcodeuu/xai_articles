Sharoon Siraj, Arafat Minhas and Ali Majid picked up two wickets each.\n\nEarlier, Multan opener Zain Abbas struck a half-century (51 off 41) to help his team post a decent total. Valuable contributions from player-of-the-match Arafat Minhas (37 off 18), Mohammad Shahzad (23 off 18) and Waseem Akram Jr (12-ball 18 not out) took them to 167-7 in 20 overs.\n\nMeanwhile, Sialkot easily chased Azad Jammu and Kashmir’s 138-run target in 14.3 overs while losing only two wickets courtesy opener Mirza Tahir Baig’s blazing half-century.\n\nTahir’s 44-ball 76 not out laced with seven fours and four sixes helped AJK reach the target in style.\n\nEarlier, player-of-the-match Usama Mir and Hasan Ali’s three blows each kept AJK’s batting progress in check after a 65-run opening stand between Hasnain Nadeem (43) and Hasan Raza (39). AJK were eventually steered to 137-6 by Aqib Liaquat (nine-ball 24).\n\nIn a Group ‘A’ match, Peshawar routed Larkana by seven wickets at the Multan Cricket Stadium. Chasing 132, Peshawar openers Sahibzada Farhan (39-ball 76) and Waqar Ahmed (32-ball 40) laid the foundations of a huge victory with a 124-run stand.\n\nEarlier, Peshawar’s pacers Mohammad Amir Khan (3-23), Niaz Khan (3-30) and Ihsanullah (1-36) restricted Larkana to 131-9 after they elected to bat first. Sahibzada was named player of the match.\n\nIn a Group ‘A’ fixture, Lahore Whites outclassed Quetta by 10 wickets at the Multan Cricket Stadium.\n\nAfter electing to bat first, Quetta could only post 86-8.
