  "content": "NEW YORK: White House-led talks on the future of TikTok are coalescing around a plan for the biggest non-Chinese investors in parent company ByteDance to up their stakes and acquire the short video app’s US operations, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.\n\nThe plan entails spinning off a US entity for TikTok and diluting Chinese ownership in the new business to below the 20 per cent threshold required by US law, rescuing the app from a looming ban, said the sources.\n\nJeff Yass’s Susquehanna International Group and Bill Ford’s General Atlantic, both of which are represented on ByteDance’s board, are leading discussions with the White House on the plan, the sources said.\n\nPrivate equity firm KKR is also participating, one of the sources said.\n\nThe fate of the short video app used by nearly half of all Americans has been up in the air since a law took effect on Jan 19 requiring ByteDance to either sell it or face a ban on national security grounds.\n\nThe law, passed last year with broad bipartisan support, reflects concern in Washington that TikTok’s ownership makes it beholden to the Chinese government and that Beijing could use the app to conduct influence operations against the United States. Free speech advocates have argued that the ban unlawfully threatens to restrict Americans from accessing foreign media in violation of the First Amendment of the constitution.\n\nThe company has said US officials have misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the US.\n\nUnder the plan proposed by existing investors, software giant Oracle would continue to house US user data and provide assurances that the data is not accessible from China, this source added.\n\nThe Financial Times reported on Friday that US ByteDance investors were seeking to buy out Chinese investors in a proposed deal for a spun-off TikTok US business, naming investment firm Coatue as another existing investor involved in the talks.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order postponing enforcement of the law to April 5 shortly after taking office.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
