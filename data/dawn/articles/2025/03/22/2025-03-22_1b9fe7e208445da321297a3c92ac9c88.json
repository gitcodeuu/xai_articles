  "content": "KHYBER: Proscribed militant organisation Lashkar-i-Islam (LI) has imposed a ‘ban’ on shaving beards along with refraining the barbers from ‘stylish’ beard cuts in some parts of Tirah valley.\n\nSources in the region told Dawn that a pamphlet issued by commander Chamthu Afridi of LI was distributed and pasted in different parts and marketplaces, particularly in Bar Bagh Markaz, which warned the local barbers and residents not to shave their beard.\n\nIt was also made clear in the ‘important instructions’ by the said commander that action would also be taken against shopkeepers for inflated prices and hoarding during the month of fasting, while local youth were also warned against the use of ice and useless roaming around on their motorcycles.\n\nThe pamphlet further advised the mobile dealers and computer users to desist from downloading any objectionable material on both their mobiles and computers while also refraining from copying any such material in the memory cards of teenagers or boys.\n\nIt called upon the elders to keep an eye on the activities of their youth while asking local residents not to indulge in any verbal or physical clashes and quarrels during Ramazan with a warning of punishment for those who were found guilty of violating the edicts.\n\nThe pamphlets also made it clear to the local residents to immediately report the matter to them if any armed men demanded money from them in the name of their organisation.\n\nLocal residents confirmed that armed activists of LI distributed these pamphlets among them and the shopkeepers while also pasting these at prominent locations in order to inform the maximum number of people.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
