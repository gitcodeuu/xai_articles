Justice Khan was elevated to the Islamabad High Court by the Judicial Commission of Pakistan earlier this year.\n\nIn addition, the judges also set aside the appointments of Judge Arjumand, D&SJ Wajid Ali, D&SJ Humayun Dilawar, AD&SJ Qudratullah; and SCJs Abbas Shah, Ihtasham Allam Khan and Inamullah.\n\n“Neither the letter nor the spirit of Islamabad High Court Act, 2010, allows filling permanent posts in the subordinate judiciary established for Islamabad Capital Territory on deputation basis, by borrowing judges from Provincial High Courts,” the order said.\n\nIt called on the IHC registrar to “make arrangements to return all members presently serving in the subordinate judiciary for Islamabad Capital Territory on deputation within six months from the date of this order”.\n\nIt stated that members of the tribunal had taken a decision on the appeal on Mar 13, but were later informed of a Mar 17 verbal directive, instructing them not to announce judgements as steps were being taken to dissolve the tribunal.\n\nSubsequently, the March 18 notification purportedly reconstituted the tribunal on the advice of the acting chief justice.\n\nHowever, the three judges held that this notification was unlawful, asserting that once the tribunal had been constituted in accordance with the Islamabad Subordinate Judiciary Service Tribunal Act, 2016, it could not be dissolved or reconstituted without legal justification.\n\n“As the high court is a collegium, the administrative authority vested in the office of the chief justice must be exercised in a consensual manner… any decision by the chief justice or a committee appointed by the chief justice, that is not in accordance with the requirements of the law is not sustainable in the eyes of law, including decisions with regard to an appointment on deputations, induction, or promotion, and is liable to be set aside by this tribunal,” the order said.\n\nThe three judges also made several critical observations. They ruled that the appointment of judges on deputation to the Islamabad judiciary was unconstitutional and ordered the repatriation of all judges currently serving on deputation within six months.\n\nThe three judges declared the appointment of Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro, Justice Mohammad Azam Khan and Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas as members of the IHC Tribunal ‘unconstitutional’.\n\nThe judges also held that the acting chief justice had no administrative authority to interfere with the tribunal’s functions, stating that such actions were outside the scope of the Constitution and law.\n\nRecognising the impact of their decision, the judges ordered the suspension of the enforcement of their order for 30 days, to allow the affected parties to appeal before the Supreme Court.\n\nNotably, these three judges are among those who have challenged the recent transfer of acting IHC Chief Justice Sarfraz Dogar, Justice Soomro and Justice Mohammad Asif to the IHC.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
