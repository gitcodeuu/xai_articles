The new bond aims to attract both local and international financing to support green projects.\n\nSpeaking at a signing ceremony, Mr Aurangzeb stressed the need to translate climate awareness into actionable solutions.\n\nHe also recalled recent discussions with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the Climate Resiliency Fund, describing them as promising steps toward securing vital funding.\n\nMr Aurangzeb acknowledged the need for structural enablers such as a well-defined bond yield curve, secondary market liquidity, and a robust green taxonomy framework.\n\nHe welcomed the State Bank of Pakistan’s initiative to introduce such a Green Taxonomy framework, which will standardise project assessments, monitoring, and reporting at an international level.\n\nEarth Hour message\n\nMeanwhile, in his message on Earth Hour day, which will be observed in Pakistan at 8:30pm today (Saturday), the prime minister said the government was actively pursuing policies that integrate climate action across all sectors, with initiatives designed to build resilience and sustainability.\n\n“Programmes like Recharge Pakistan are restoring ecosystems, while policies such as the National Adaptation Plan (2023) and National Clean Air Policy (2023) provide a strategic roadmap for a cleaner, more sustainable future.”\n\n“Despite contributing less than 1pc to global greenhouse gas emissions, Pakistan is among the most climate-vulnerable countries. We have witnessed devastating floods, scorching heatwaves, and prolonged droughts — events that threaten millions of lives, food security, water resources, and urban infrastructure,” he noted.\n\nIn his message, the prime minister said: “Our commitment to renewable energy expansion, plastic waste reduction, and green job creation is laying the foundation for long-term environmental stewardship. However, policies alone are not enough — true change begins at home. Every action, no matter how small, strengthens the collective momentum toward a sustainable tomorrow.”\n\nWith input from APP\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2025",
