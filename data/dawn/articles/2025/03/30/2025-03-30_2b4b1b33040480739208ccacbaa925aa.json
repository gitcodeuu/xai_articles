  "content": "MIAMI GARDENS: Novak Djokovic is one victory away from a 100th career singles title after breezing past Grigor Dimitrov 6-2, 6-3 on Friday to reach the Miami Open final, where he will face unseeded Czech teenager Jakub Mensik.\n\nAfter being broken to start the match, Djokovic quickly settled in, breaking back in the next game and again for a 4-2 advantage on a mis-hit forehand by 14th seed Dimitrov.\n\nThe Serbian pocketed the first set when the Bulgarian’s volley sailed long, and he maintained the momentum in the second to race to a 3-0 lead.\n\nDjokovic pounded an unreturnable serve on his second match point to improve to a 13-1 career record against Dimitrov.\n\nThe fourth seed’s serving masterclass in South Florida showed no sign of letting up in the semi-final. He missed just six first serves while pounding five aces to one double fault.\n\n“It was very windy today, very difficult to control the ball, changing direction all the time but I had good serves and held my nerves,” Djokovic said. “The serve was again the highlight of the match for me. I think it was 84 per cent last game and I thought that would be difficult to beat that but today it was 87pc so I don’t know what to say? Hopefully, I can continue in the same fashion because that definitely make my life easier.”\n\nDjokovic has played 307 ATP Tour-level tournaments in his storied career and triumphed in 99 of them. Of the 76 Grand Slams he has entered, the Serbian has won a men’s record 24.\n\nAmerican Jimmy Connors won 109 singles titles during the Open Era while Swiss great Roger Federer captured 103.\n\nAfter a slow start to the season, Djokovic has his swagger back and his eye on his 100th win.\n\n“After the Olympics, which was the 99th title, every tournament I play in has been going for 100 and I haven’t be able to achieve that. Hopefully Sunday, I am going to go all in,” he said.\n\nDimitrov has now lost 10 straight matches against the Serb and was philosophical in defeat. “He’s just doing the basics extremely well, better than anyone. You just cannot let yourself take a step down or make an easy error,” he said.\n\nLionel Messi was in the stands to watch the game after training nearby with Inter Miami and Djokovic was delighted to see him.\n\n“Amazing to have him, a great honor,” he said of Messi. “I admire him as most of the world for most of his career so it’s amazing that he keeps going. We’re the same age, born in ‘87, so it’s quite nice to have him around.”\n\nMENSIK STUNS FRITZ\n\nDjokovic will take on Mensik for the title after the 19-year-old outlasted American third seed Taylor Fritz 7-6 (7/4), 4-6, 7-6 (7/4) under the lights.\n\nMensik pounded 25 aces and despite never breaking Fritz’s powerful serve, prevailed in both of the match’s two taut tiebreaks, leaping onto the court and screaming after sealing the win.\n\nDjokovic beat Mensik in a tight three-setter in their only previous meeting in Shanghai last year but Mensik is brimming with confidence coming into his first Masters 1000 final.\n\n“For me it was a dream to play against [Djokovic],” he said. “But now it’s a bit different. I am a better player now. I’m going to enjoy it, it’s going to be really exciting. Let’s see what’s going to happen on Sunday.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 30th, 2025",
