Additionally, textile and fashion waste in cities often ends up in landfills, where it takes decades to decompose and releases harmful greenhouse gases.\n\n92m tonnes of waste being produced evey year globally\n\nIn Pakistan, according to a study’s findings, about 270,125.34 tonnes of textile waste is generated annually, including about 19,304.58 tonnes from Karachi.\n\nThe study published by the Pakistan Journal of Scientific and Industrial Research, shows that among Pakistan’s economic classes, the highest amount textiles are discarded by the lower income class (class C); class A Plus tends to trash about 195kg of clothing annually, whereas Class A and B demonstrate an annual discard of 150kg and 105kg textile waste respectively.\n\nThe major challenge to sustainable management of textile waste in Pakistan is inadequate technical and financial resources and a lack of awareness.\n\nThe study finds that there is a significant lack of awareness among the educated people in Pakistan about textile waste management and recycling. This knowledge gap is mainly because of the limited awareness campaigns and the absence of environmental concerns and textile waste recycling topics in higher education curricula.\n\nTextile industries in Pakistan are also inadequately familiar with the textile waste recycling and its economic, environmental and social implications. Currently, textile industries in the country are lacking a consolidated approach to sustainable management of textile wastes resulting to lose the economic benefits such as revenue generation through inland selling and export of recycled textiles besides the environmental benefits of waste recycling and reuse.\n\n“Unsustainable fashion is aggravating the triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature, land and biodiversity loss, and pollution and waste,” said Inger Andersen, Executive Director of UNEP.\n\n“We need to focus on a circular economy approach that values sustainable production, reuse and repair. By working together, consumers, industry and governments can support genuinely durable fashion and help reduce our fashion footprint.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 30th, 2025",
