  "content": "Muslims in several countries are celebrating Eidul Fitr — one of Islam’s most significant holidays, which marks the end of the fasting month of Ramazan and is typically celebrated by feasting and gift-giving — on Sunday.\n\nAmong other notable personalities, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres extended Eidul Fitr greetings with “a heavy heart,” noting that millions of Muslims would mark the occasion under war and displacement rather than traditional family gatherings, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\n“I want to express my best wishes for Eidul Fitr to all Muslims around the world,” the UN chief said in a video statement he shared on X.\n\n“But I do so with a heavy heart, thinking about the many Muslims who won’t be able to celebrate Eid with their families due to war, conflict or displacement,” he added.\n\nHis message came as Palestinians in Gaza, Kashmiris under Indian occupation, Rohingya refugees, people in Sudan, and other conflict-affected Muslim populations face particularly somber celebrations amid ongoing violence and humanitarian crises.\n\nHeader image: A child holds a balloon as Muslims gather in front of the Dome of the Rock shrine in Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa Mosque compound to celebrate the Eidul Fitr, which marks the end of the holy fasting month of Ramazan, on March 30. — AFP",
