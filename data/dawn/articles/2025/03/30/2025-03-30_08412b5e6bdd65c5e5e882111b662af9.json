The only way automakers can eke out profits on economy cars, analysts say, is to build them in nations with lower manufacturing costs.\n\nA Reuters review of data from two auto research firms found just 16 models with an average sticker price of less than $30,000 and only one, Toyota’s 7203.T Corolla, that is assembled in the United States. All others are made in Mexico, South Korea, or Japan.\n\nSlapping a 25pc tariff on these low-end cars may force price increases that make them unaffordable to their target market or cause some automakers to abandon them entirely, industry analysts said.\n\n“New vehicles across the board are going to be more expensive,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president of research firm AutoForecast Solutions. “That’s going to push more buyers into the used market, which will also raise the price of used vehicles.”\n\nBurnis Carrington, of Monroe, Louisiana, is shopping for a used car instead of a new one, as he worries about tariff-driven price increases.\n\n“Most families in need of a family car are paying prices that approach nearly half of what their home may be worth,” he said. “The underlying problem is still that nothing is being done to make the vehicles made domestically more affordable.”\n\nTrump’s political base of rural supporters could be among those bearing the brunt of the import taxes. About half of voters reporting household incomes of less than $50,000 annually backed Trump’s 2024 election, along with 56pc of voters without college degrees, according to an Edison Research exit poll.\n\nTrump told NBC News on Saturday that he “couldn’t care less” if automakers hike prices, “because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they’re going to buy American cars”.\n\nMany of those foreign cars are made by American automakers, including three under-$30,000 vehicles from GM: The Buick Envista and Chevrolet Trax and Trailblazer. All three are made in South Korea. GM also makes hundreds of thousands of its hot-selling full-sized trucks in Mexico.\n\nTrump argues tariffs will spark a boom in the US auto industry. Some experts contend that high import taxes will have the opposite effect.\n\n“As vehicle affordability decreases due to higher prices, households may begin prioritizing other areas of their budget, cutting back on discretionary spending or delaying large purchases,” conservative supply-side economist Arthur Laffer wrote in a March report.\n\nDetroit automakers General Motors, Ford and Stellantis, the maker of Jeeps and Ram trucks, have discontinued most entry-level models in recent years to focus on highly profitable trucks and SUVs. That has left the economy-vehicle market almost entirely to Asian automakers.\n\n“I just don’t see them ever really going back there,” said Karl Brauer, executive analyst at iSeeCars.com.\n\nFord makes its least expensive vehicles, the compact Maverick truck and mid-sized Bronco Sport, in Mexico. They both sell for more than $30,000 on average, according to data from Cox Automotive, based on average sticker prices of models sold in January and February.\n\nThe same is true for Jeep’s most affordable model, the Compass, which it builds in Mexico.\n\nThe under-$30,000 models built by Nissan, Mazda, Hyundai, Kia, Toyota, Subaru and Volkswagen are almost all built in Mexico or South Korea, according to AutoForecast Solutions.\n\nHonda makes its top-selling Civic in Canada and the United States. Its compact HR-V crossover is made in Mexico. The average sticker prices for both models were slightly above $30,000, according to Cox Automotive.\n\nThe margins on these vehicles are low, and their buyers are price-sensitive. That means high tariffs might make them impossible to sell at all, Brauer said. A 25pc tariff, he said, will “completely blow apart the business case” for entry-level vehicles.\n\nCox Automotive estimates that 25pc tariffs will add $3,000 to the cost of a US-made vehicle and $6,000 to vehicles made in Canada or Mexico.\n\nFord said it is still evaluating the potential impact of tariffs on lower-cost vehicle prices. The other automakers cited in this story did not comment.\n\nSome industry experts compared the potential impact of high tariffs to the supply-chain shortages that drove up new and used vehicle prices during the pandemic.\n\nUsed car prices have eased since then. The average used-vehicle listing price was $25,006, down 1pc from a year ago.\n\nBut the supply of more affordable used cars remains relatively tight, according to Cox. Dealers have about a 30-day supply of used cars below $15,000, or about 12 days less than the overall used-car supply.\n\n“Used vehicles in the $15,000 to $25,000 range will be the most in-demand,” because automakers will abandon that production, Fiorani said.\n\nPhoenix resident Eric Fenstermacher, 44, started car shopping more urgently as Trump started threatening tariffs. The IT worker bought a 2022 Honda Accord in mid-March after struggling to find a new vehicle he liked for less than $30,000.\n\n“I feel extremely relieved,” Fenstermacher said. “I’m glad I got this done when I did. Otherwise, this price would have gone up.”",
