In a later hearing, the bench discharged the warrants and contempt notices after the alleged contemnors assured the judges that the subject residential property will not be used for any illegal/unsanctioned purpose.\n\nSources said that the SBCA authorities informed the provincial government of the problems they were facing in implementing court directives as majority of commercial entities operating on residential plots belonged to influential persons.\n\nThe easy way, according to the sources, was to change the building regulations, as unlike the Sindh Building Control Authority Act, the KBTPR can be amended with just the director general/authority’s signature.\n\nThe SBCA sent the draft of amendments to the law department for vetting, and afterwards the SBCA Director General Ishaque Khuhro issued a notification dated March 13 and amended the KBTPR 2002.\n\nThrough the fresh amendments, the SBCA not only modified the definition of ‘amenity plot’ but also inserted a new land use term, ‘Commercial/Residential-cum Commercial Use,’ effectively providing a legal cover for thousands of commercial establishments operating on residential plots.\n\nAccording to the KBTPR 2002, an “Amenity Plot” means a plot allocated exclusively for the purpose of government, health and welfare, education, assembly, religious, parks and playgrounds, burial grounds, transportation right-of-way, parking and recreational uses as defined under Chapter 19 of the building regulations.\n\nThe health and welfare category includes “land used for health and social welfare services such as health centre, medical & dental clinics, hospitals, maternity homes, medical research institutions, nurseries, mother and child care centres, homes or other institutions for physically disabled persons, mental institutions, homes for the elderly, and veterinary clinics/hospitals including green areas and open spaces essential for the proper functioning of such institutions”.\n\nThe education use category includes “all land used for nursery schools, kindergartens, primary schools, secondary schools, high schools, colleges, special colleges. technical colleges, universities, research institutes, madressah, all such institutions related with education purposes (other than medical), and fine arts institutes, including green and open spaces essential for the proper functioning of such institutions.\n\nChapter 19 of the KBPTR 2002 categorically stated that the sites reserved for education use cannot be converted into any other use.\n\nHowever, in the KBPTR (Amendment) 2025, the SBCA removed “health and welfare and education” category from the “amenity plot” definition.\n\nThe category of “commercial use” has been replaced with “commercial / residential cum commercial use”.\n\nIn Chapter 19, the SBCA director general amended the “residential use” category and declared that the residential premises can be used for dwelling facilities as well as educational, health and recreational facilities.\n\nThrough a newly inserted clause, the “recreation use” is defined in the amended regulations as activities, facilities and spaces that facilitate leisure, social interaction and community well-being. It said this encompasses dining and social establishments, such as cafes, food courts, and similar venues, provided they contribute to the recreational and communal experience of the neighbourhood.\n\nAnother amendment was carried out in Chapter 18 titled ‘Sub-division and Amalgamation of Land and Change of Land Use’ of the KBPTR 2002 to allow use of a minimum 400 square yards residential plot located on a minimum 60-foot-wide road for “education, health or recreation purposes”.\n\n“Everyone knows there are thousands of office, schools, tea shops and restaurants, clinics and hospitals operating on residential plots. Previously, owners were required to vacate the premises since using residential land for commercial purposes was prohibited,” a senior SBCA officer told Dawn on the condition of anonymity.\n\n“In a city like Karachi, where thousands of such cases exist, displacement was not a feasible solution. To address this issue, amendments have been made with the sole intention of facilitating citizens, without any ulterior motives,” he explained.\n\nHowever, he stressed the need of checks and balances as he suspected the “builder mafia” would misuse the amendments in their favour.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 30th, 2025",
