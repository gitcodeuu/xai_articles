Our tents were destroyed… And we saw that a man and his wife were martyred.”\n\nBardawil, 65, is the third member of the political bureau to be killed since Israel resumed air strikes on Tuesday, after Yasser Harb and Essam al-Dalis, the head of the Hamas government in the Gaza Strip.\n\nBardawil, born in the Khan Yunis refugee camp, joined Hamas when it was founded in 1987, serving as a spokesman before rising through the ranks and being elected to the political bureau in 2021.\n\nHe spoke against security cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and Israel, and supported armed struggle against Israel.\n\nIn the flare-up since last week, Hamas has also announced the deaths of interior ministry head Mahmud Abu Watfa, and Bahjat Abu Sultan, the director general of the Internal Security Services.\n\nHamas sources said on Sunday that Mohammed Hassan al-Amur, the bodyguard of slain leader Yahya Sinwar, was killed in an overnight strike on his home in Khan Yunis.\n\nThe head of Hamas’s political wing, Ismail Haniyeh, was killed in Tehran on July 31, 2024, in an explosion claimed by Israel. His successor Sinwar died on Oct 16 in Gaza.\n\nPope seeks end to Israeli strikes\n\nPope Francis called on Sunday for an immediate end to the Israeli strikes and for the resumption of dialogue for the release of prisoners and secure a “definitive ceasefire”.\n\nAccording to the Gaza health ministry, at least 637 Palestinians have been killed in the renewed Israeli assault since Tuesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 24th, 2025",
