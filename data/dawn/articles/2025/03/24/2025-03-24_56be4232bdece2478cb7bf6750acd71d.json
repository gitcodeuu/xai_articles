If there’s any legal issues regarding this matter, they will be resolved promptly,” he replied.\n\nHe said that under the Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) led Sindh government, development projects worth over Rs8 billion were underway in all towns of Karachi under the CLICK scheme, and additional projects worth Rs10 billion will begin next month.\n\nNewly renovated Baradari Park in North Nazimabad inaugurated\n\n“The PPP and the Sindh government have dispelled the perception that they only focus on areas of their voters. Significant projects have been initiated in areas like District Central and District Korangi where the PPP is not in power of local administration,” he added.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the commercial use of public spaces is a violation of several judgements of the Supreme Court that has disallowed such activities in public parks, on drains and footpaths.\n\nIn North Nazimabad alone, some 14 parks have been rented out to private contractors for commercial use over the years.\n\nThe private contractors are accused of doing businesses on public spaces against a very nominal charges being paid to town administrations.\n\nDuring the ceremony adviser to the chief minister Syed Najmi Alam, special assistant to the chief minister Raza Haroon, Senator Masroor Ahsan, president of PPP District Central Sardar Khan, Shehzad Majid, Niaz Ahmed Khan, Dil Muhammad and North Nazimabad Town Chairman Atif Khan were also present.\n\nMr Ghani called the park a “great addition” to the recreation activities for people of North Nazimabad.\n\n“Similar schemes are being implemented in towns across Karachi with the cooperation of local bodies. Some 19 schemes worth Rs1.8 billion are currently under execution in District Central under CLICK, and a total of 99 projects worth over Rs8.2 billion are being run throughout the city, all of which are expected to be completed by December this year. An additional Rs9.9 billion will be allocated for 75 new projects set to commence in April 2025,” he added.\n\nResponding to a question, Mr Ghani stressed the importance of public participation in maintaining such projects.\n\nHe mentioned that it is the responsibility of the local residents, alongside town administration, to ensure the upkeep of such parks and other facilities.\n\nRegarding the progress of ongoing projects, the minister acknowledged delays but stated that they were caused by underlying issues, which would be addressed.\n\nThe minister said that major parks with high public footfall would be given priority for renovation, and that town administrations would be tasked with their maintenance.\n\nIf towns face any difficulties due to limited resources, the Sindh government would help them in addressing these challenges, he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 24th, 2025",
