The decision is effective immediately and cannot be appealed.\n\nHan, who immediately resumed the acting presidency Monday, thanked the Constitutional Court for its “wise decision”.\n\n“I believe that all citizens are clearly speaking out against the highly polarised political sphere. I think there is no place for division now. Our country’s priority is to move forward,” he added.\n\nThe court’s decision was closely watched as it comes ahead of a highly anticipated ruling on suspended President Yoon’s impeachment, the date of which has not yet been announced.\n\nDespite experts predicting a verdict on that case by mid-March, the Constitutional Court has yet to rule, making Yoon’s case the longest deliberation in its history.\n\nThe leader of the opposition, Lee Jae-myung, said the verdict on Han should not be “disrespected” but urged the Constitutional Court to move more swiftly on Yoon’s case.\n\n“The entire nation is losing sleep over Yoon Suk Yeol’s illegal military coup,” he said, adding it was “hard to fathom why the Constitutional Court continues to postpone the ruling date.”\n\n“Every day, every hour, every minute, every second, the international trust in the Republic of Korea is being broken, the economic damage is mounting,” he added.\n\nIf Yoon’s impeachment is upheld, South Korea must hold fresh elections within 60 days of the verdict.\n\nMonday’s ruling “does not have a direct legal correlation with the pending decision on Yoon’s impeachment,” Yoo Jung-hoon, attorney and political commentator, told AFP.\n\n“The judges did not deliberate on the legality of martial law but rather on Han’s involvement in the case,” he said.\n\nYoon was suspended by parliament in December. He was arrested in January in a dawn raid in connection to a separate criminal investigation on insurrection charges — which are not covered by presidential immunity.\n\nYoon is the first sitting South Korean president to stand trial in a criminal case. He was released from detention in early March on procedural grounds — a move that has appeared to invigorate his supporters.\n\nHundreds of thousands of South Koreans took to the streets over the weekend, as rallies for and against Yoon intensified ahead of the court verdict.\n\nLawmaker Kweon Seong-dong from Yoon’s ruling People Power Party told reporters at the National Assembly that Han’s reinstatement was welcome.\n\nThe opposition who impeached him should “apologise to the people for paralysing state affairs for 87 days with a hasty impeachment bid,” which was done for political purposes, Kweon added.",
