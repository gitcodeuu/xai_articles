The FIR states that the accused also intercepted a private ambulance at Hockey Chowk, assaulted the driver and loaded the bodies into the vehicle.\n\nAdditionally, at Brewery Police Station, an FIR has been registered against BYC leaders Gulzadi Baloch, Ali Jan, Shoaib, Syed Noor Shah, Waheed, Jahanzeb, Zohaib Baloch and over 100 others for blocking the Western Bypass Road in Quetta on Saturday, chanting anti-state slogans and inciting public unrest.\n\nAccording to police officials, Dr Mahrang Baloch’s arrest has not been officially disclosed. She is not in the custody of Civil Lines Police and remains in Quetta District Jail under MPO provisions.\n\nProtests, blockades\n\nAfter the crackdown, shutter-down strikes were observed for the second consecutive day in several cities of Balochistan, including Turbat, Mastung, Kalat, Kharan, Chaghi, Dalbandin, Dhadar and Panjgur.\n\nIn Turbat, protesters blocked the Turbat-Karachi highway, disrupting traffic, while in Hub, demonstrators blocked the Quetta-Karachi highway at Bhawani to protest Dr Mahrang Baloch’s arrest.\n\nHowever, police dispersed the protesters with tear gas and baton charges on Sunday morning. According to the police, the highway has been reopened for traffic.\n\nInternet shutdown\n\nMeanwhile, internet services in Quetta and surrounding areas remained suspended for the fourth consecutive day on Sunday.\n\nAlthough PTCL officials claimed late on Sunday evening that services had been restored, users continued facing disruptions. The shutdown, imposed without prior announcement on Wednesday afternoon, severed communication between Quetta and other parts of the country.\n\nThe suspension also affected mobile data and WhatsApp services, causing significant inconvenience to residents. When contacted, authorities failed to provide a clear reason for the prolonged blackout.\n\nEarlier, Quetta also faced a similar internet shutdown for four days following the train hijacking incident.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 24th, 2025",
