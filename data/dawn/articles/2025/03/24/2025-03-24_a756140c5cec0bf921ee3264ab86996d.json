Those with Afghan Citizen Cards have been asked to leave by March 31 whereas those who have Proof of Registration from UNHCR can stay in Pakistan till June 30.\n\nThe letter also asked for streamlining the exit permit process to ensure that Afghans with immigration pathways to third countries and who were ready to depart could leave without “roadblocks”.\n\nIn an open letter, premier asked to exempt Afghans awaiting resettlement to US from refoulement\n\nAccording to the letter, the recent decision to deport Afghans will “affect Special Immigration Visa (SIV) applicants, those with referrals to the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP), and Humanitarian Parole applicants, all of whom have a pending or approved pathway to legal US immigration”.\n\nIt said many Afghans residing in Pakistan are in the “late stages of exhaustive vetting processes and are awaiting US visa or refugee status approval” and sending them back to Afghanistan “runs counter to humanitarian principles and international accords to which Pakistan is a signatory”.\n\n“At a minimum, we hope to see an exemption from detention or deportation for Afghans who have pending or approved immigration applications to the United States,” the letter added.\n\nIt also pointed out complications in the visa extension process. “Afghan nationals in Pakistan are facing challenges with visa extensions, including exorbitant costs and potential delays, with some reporting a shift from longer to shorter extensions. Previously, visa extensions were available for longer periods (three or six months), but now they are often limited to one month at a cost of $100 or Rs20,000,” it said, urging Pakistan to treat Afghan refugees “appropriately according to international law”.\n\n“Visa extension procedures can be slow and uncertain, leading to further complications for those relying on them. There are overstay charges, with no condonation, and no surcharge for children under 12, but a 50pc surcharge for those under 18,” it added.\n\nThe letter urged the prime minister to consider that the deportation of the vulnerable individuals contravenes international obligations surrounding the humane treatment of refugees and asylees, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. “Time is of the essence; lives are at stake, and the international community is watching.\n\nWe strongly urge you to act promptly and compassionately. Afghan refugees would welcome the opportunity to discuss these matters with officials of your government to strengthen our cooperation,“ it concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 24th, 2025",
