This is why the state has been violent with us and has taken Sammi Baloch and others.”\n\nSouth Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com that the Karachi commissioner had issued a notification regarding a ban on any public assemblies or protests, however, various groups, including the BYC, had planned protests in the Red Zone.\n\n“Police scuttled the gathering and around six protestors, including Sammi Deen Baloch, have been arrested on violation of Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code and locked up in Women Police Station,” he said.\n\nHe said 14 detained protesters, including females, were released by late in the evening, however, the six detained individuals, including Sammi, were formally booked over violation of Section 144.\n\nA large number of civil society activists were seen standing outside the police station at Artillery Maidan where the protesters were detained. DIG Raza said the police had decided to lodge a case against them under Section 188 (disobedience to an order lawfully promulgated by a public servant) of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n\nLater, the Artillery Maidan Police registered a first information report (FIR) against Sammi and five others under Section 188 (disobedience to an order duly promulgated by a public servant) for violating Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code imposed by the Karachi commissioner to ban all rallies in the Red Zone.\n\nAccording to the contents of the FIR, Assistant Sub-Inspector Mubarak Masih said that he along with other policemen and lady police were performing their duty when around 35-40 men and women arrived at Fawara Chowk and attempted to enter the Red Zone.\n\nThe complainant said he and other policemen tried to prevent them but they “forcibly” entered the Red Zone. He added that the police took action and detained Sammi, Abdul Wahab and four others while others fled taking advantage of the rush.\n\nHuman Rights Commission of Pakistan’s senior official Qazi Khizar, one of the participants of the protest, told Dawn.com that the BYC and civil society organisations had given a call for a “peaceful” protest against the detention of Dr Mahrang and others, and the crackdown on activists in Balochistan.\n\nHe said the civil society organisations, certain political figures and a large number of young people, particularly women, arrived near the KPC but it was blocked from three routes. Thus, they were compelled to gather at Fawara Chowk near Zainab Market. Khizar said when they attempted to move further, contingents of the police led by senior officers prevented them by contending that Section 144 had been imposed.\n\nThe HRCP activist said the protesters had “agreed” to disperse when the police suddenly began allegedly manhandling the activists. “The police adopted a brutal way to deal with the protesters,” the HRCP leader alleged, adding that 13 women were taken away but the number of men was not known.\n\nHe said it was a “strange” thing to note that in contrast to their “peaceful” protest, there were several people who claimed to represent the Pakistan Ulema Council and other groups were seen chanting slogans and demonstrating against the Baloch activists under “police protection”. They carried banners, inscribing slogans against the BYC but the police were not preventing them from violating Section 144, he said.\n\nThe HRCP leader said Mahrang and Sammi were “representative women leaders” of Balochistan who talked about constitutional rights and they needed to be engaged in dialogue to address the volatile situation in the province.\n\nFront Line Defenders, an Irish organisation advocating and working for the protection of human rights, condemned Sammi’s arrest and said it was deeply concerned about the development. “We call for her immediate release and an end to reprisals against Baloch human rights defenders,” it said in a post on X.\n\nIn a statement earlier today, the Karachi Traffic Police said: “Both roads from Din Muhammad Wafai Road to MR Kiani Chowrangi towards Fawara Chowk have been closed for traffic.\n\n“Local police have closed the road due to security,” the statement added.\n\nIt continued that alternative traffic routes had been devised from MR Kiani Chowrangi towards Court Road, Thana Gali towards Sarwar Shaheed Road and Fawara Chowk towards Zainab Market.\n\nThe public was requested to call Traffic Helpline 1915 for alternative routes to avoid any inconvenience.\n\nAccording to a post on X, the BYC protest in Karachi was scheduled for 4pm and was organised in collaboration with civil society members, while a protest in Quetta was scheduled for noon.\n\nOn the other hand, two separate counter-protests were held in the nearby area, where participants held placards and chanted slogans against the BYC as well as the banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA).\n\nHowever, it was unclear under what arrangements the counter-protests were organised despite the imposition of Section 144.\n\nOne such protest was being held outside the KPC, with participants holding placards reading “a link to RAW: BLA and BYC”, referring to India’s intelligence agency Research and Analysis Wing.\n\nMore people gathered at a petrol station near the Zainab Market, with one of the placards reading “two sides of the same coin — BLA and BYC”.\n\nSome banners carried by protesters at the Fawara Chowk mentioned the Pakistan Ulema Council as the organiser.\n\nAnother demonstration was also held to show solidarity with the armed forces near Zainab Market. Videos of the protest showed protesters chanting slogans against the BYC leadership as well as BLA.\n\nDeputy Inspector General (DIG) South Syed Asad Raza told Dawn.com, “Some people were organising a counter-protest at Fawara Chowk; they were dispersed. Nobody is being allowed to organise public protests or assemblies in the light of notification by Commissioner Karachi.”\n\nThe Karachi commissioner imposed Section 144 across the city “in view of the prevailing law and order situation” today, according to a notification.\n\nThe notification came in response to a recommendation made by Karachi South Zone Deputy Inspector General of Police (DIG) Syed Asad Raza to the commissioner on Sunday.\n\nToday’s notification by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi read that under Section 144, he had imposed a “complete ban on any types of protests, demonstrations, sit-ins, rallies and assembly of more than five persons within the Karachi division with immediate effect for March 24, 2025.”\n\nIn his recommendation on Sunday, DIG Raza had said that “in the context of [the] present law and order situation in the city, it is required that [the] ban may be imposed in South Zone on protests, demonstrations, sit-ins and rallies” being held on major roads, which would result in traffic jams and posed “grave security threats”.\n\nIt had further said that in view of the prevailing law and order situation, “it is essential that necessary measures be taken to protect the participants, the public and the integrity of the event”.\n\n“It is therefore requested that [a] ban on any type of protest, demonstrations, sit-in rallies and assembly of more than five persons may kindly be imposed within the limits of South Zone under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code from March 24 to 31, 2025.”\n\nMeanwhile, the closure of major roads to scuttle the protest triggered a massive traffic jam in the city centre in the evening, according to Traffic DIG Pir Mohammed Shah.\n\nHe said a traffic situation began at 3:45pm when three roads, namely Aiwan Sadar Road, MD Wafai Road and Sarwar Shaheed Road, were closed for traffic because of some protests at the KPC.\n\nThe traffic police chief said they were peak hours and it was the first day of the week, which adversely affected the flow of traffic on II Chundrigar Road and other adjoining areas. He said though the roads were opened at 6:15pm, the situation returned to normalcy at 7pm.\n\nThe DIG said he and all senior traffic police personnel had also broken their fast on the streets as they were also stuck up in traffic jams while attempting to clear the roads.\n\nApart from the protest, DIG Raza cited another reason behind the traffic situation. He said the Sindh governor had arranged children’s entertainment outside the Governor’s House without informing the district police and traffic police. He added that when traffic was choked on Aiwan Sadar Road, it affected the flow of traffic on other roads.",
