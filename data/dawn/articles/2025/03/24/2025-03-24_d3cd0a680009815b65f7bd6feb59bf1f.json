  "content": "LAHORE: The police want amendments to existing rules and laws to increase fines for traffic violations by up to ten times compared to the standard fines depending on the type of vehicle while proposing a 100pc hike in annual tax on personal vehicles.\n\nInspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar has moved a summary to the provincial government for amendments to the rules to introduce, for the first time, the Scaling Traffic Fines System (STFS) and Traffic Violation Point System (TVPS) with the objective of ‘punishing hard’ the repeat violators using luxury vehicles in the province.\n\nIt has proposed that if an individual accumulates more than 29 demerit points for traffic violations within one year, the licensing authority shall issue an order, disqualifying them from holding or obtaining a driving license for one year.\n\nThe summary was drafted and sent by Lahore Chief Traffic Officer DIG Athar Waheed to the Punjab police chief for approval from the provincial assembly through amendments to the existing laws.\n\nNew system proposes up to 10 times increase in traffic violation fines; 100pc raise in annual tax on personal vehicles; punishments include suspension of license\n\nThe initial approval of the summary was granted in a recent meeting attended by the chief secretary, the provincial police chief and other senior officers concerned when the CTO presented the proposed draft. Later, the IGP moved the same to the Punjab government for final consideration.\n\nAfter the final approval of the summary, the fine for each repeat traffic violation shall be increased by five percent of the previous penalty. The proposed amendment may be structured in accordance with the mutatis mutandis analogy of Section 86 and the 11th Schedule of the National Highways Safety Ordinance 2000.\n\nMoreover, to ensure fair enforcement of traffic laws while considering individuals’ economic circumstances, the Lahore CTO proposed that traffic fines will be scaled based on the following criteria:\n\n• Level 1: Luxury Vehicles – Ten times the standard fine.\n\n• Level 2: Public Transport – Five times the standard fine.\n\n• Level 3: General Citizens (Middle Class) – Two times the standard fine.\n\nThe above-mentioned adjustments will be implemented after making the Digital Challaning System legally compliant with an effective database by amending Section 116-A and the Twelfth Schedule of the Ordinance, in accordance with the enclosed framework. In addition to the above, it was proposed that the annual tax on personal vehicles be increased by 100 percent.\n\n“It is requested that the provincial cabinet of Punjab approve an amendment to Section 3 and the corresponding Schedule of the Motor Vehicle Taxation Act, 1958, to implement this increase,” reads the summary.\n\nThe CTO Lahore added that the higher taxes on personal vehicles may encourage individuals to use public transit, leading to fewer vehicles on the road. This could reduce traffic congestion and air pollution caused by vehicular emissions\n\nThe summary has given a reference of the global practice for improving the road safety and discipline which help the police authorities to regulate the traffic laws effectively, ensuring safety of the lives of the citizens, pressing hard to adopt the same in the largest province of the country.\n\nGiving a background perspective to the proposed amendments, the IGP said scaling traffic fines and introducing a traffic violation point system were globally recognised strategies for improving road safety and discipline. He added that the countries that enforced strict fine structures and well-regulated point systems generally experienced lower accident rates and enhanced compliance with traffic laws.\n\n“Implementing such measures in Lahore could lead to long-term improvements in driving behaviour and is necessary to enhance compliance, ensure fairness and improve road safety,” reads the summary.\n\nThis approach could also help reduce traffic accidents and fatalities by enforcing stricter adherence to traffic laws.\n\nAccording to the summary, the flat-rate fines disproportionately burden low-income individuals while having little impact on the wealthy.\n\n“Scaling fines based on income or vehicle type ensures penalties are equally effective, preventing affluent individuals from repeatedly paying small fines without changing their behaviour”, reads the summary.\n\nAdditionally, adjusting the traffic fines to match the economic conditions ensures that they remain meaningful. A fairer, income-based system can enhance public confidence in traffic enforcement, reducing the perception that fines serve primarily as a revenue-generating tool.\n\nFurthermore, according to the document, the traffic violation point system assigns specific point values to different offenses, with accumulated points resulting in penalties such as fines, mandatory driving courses or license suspension. This system encourages safer driving by deterring repeat violations, the summary says, adding that implementing such a system alongside existing measures could further enhance road safety and improve compliance with traffic regulations in Punjab.\n\n“In view of the above, it is requested that the provincial cabinet of Punjab approve an amendment to Section 116-A and the Twelfth Schedule of the Punjab Provincial Motor Vehicle Ordinance, 1965 (the Ordinance) to implement a Traffic Violation Point System,” reads the summary.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that the Lahore High Court, Lahore had increased the fine to Rs2,000 for the certain violations, including driving against one way, riding motorcycle without helmet, driving without license, vehicles emitting excessive smog, wrong parking etc.\n\n“The summary may please be placed before the Punjab chief minister for consideration and approval”, concludes the summary.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 24th, 2025",
