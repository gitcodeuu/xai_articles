We are no one’s slaves; here there are neither masters nor servants,’’ he said.\n\nMr Achakzai added the first right over resources belongs to provinces and their local populations, and their share must be clearly defined.\n\nHe said finding those responsible for the attack was the duty of the state since intelligence agencies claim to be the best in the world. “If they fail to find the culprits, then the state and its institutions will be held accountable for our killings. This is our will to our people,” he declared.\n\nAnnouncing the protest for September 8, Mr Achakzai said: “If we had wished to exploit public emotions that night, our workers could have set fire to all police stations and government offices in the province. Instead, we chose a peaceful, serious, and effective political response. On September 8, trains, airports, wheels, and shutters will all come to a standstill.”\n\nThe PkMAP chairman invited all political parties, including PPP and PML-N, to join the struggle and “speak with the generals” by demanding that the country be run according to the Constitution, law, and democratic principles. He said only in such a system could Pakistan become an Asian Tiger within 10 years.\n\nSardar Akhtar Mengal said that had the perpetrators of the March 29 incident been brought to justice, the blood of innocents would not have been spilt on September 2.\n\nHe accused the state of employing every tactic against political workers while failing to trace terrorists. He alleged that elements both within and outside official institutions may be contributing to terrorism, adding that the rulers had learned nothing from the killing of Nawab Bugti and were now targeting them as well.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 5th, 2025",
