We continue to monitor the situation very closely.”\n\nRescuers searched for any people trapped under debris after the rain triggered a landslide at the Ratle hydroelectric power project on the Chenab river in Drabshalla, officials said.\n\nIndian weather officials have forecast showers to ease off on Thursday, with moderate rain expected in held Kashmir and the state of Uttarkhand.\n\nIn Delhi, the capital, the Yamuna river passed the danger mark on Tuesday, in a flow the Central Water Commission described as a ‘severe’ situation.\n\nOn Thursday, muddy water poured into many homes in low-lying areas, from which thousands had already been evacuated to safer places as a precaution.\n\nAuthorities shut the historic Loha Pul, or Iron Bridge, spanning the Yamuna in the older part of the city.\n\nPeople waded through floodwaters in areas surrounding the historic Red Fort, many carrying an idol of Lord Ganesha, the Hindu god who vanquishes obstacles, for immersion in the river waters in an annual ritual.\n\nCrops across tens of thousands of hectares have been destroyed by the rains in the breadbasket state of Punjab where 37 have died since August began.\n\nThe deluge spurred authorities to release water pent up in dams, further flooding areas in both India and Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 5th, 2025",
