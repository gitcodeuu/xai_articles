Many tourists were on the funicular that derailed and smashed into a building.\n\nThe yellow Gloria funicular, a beloved symbol of the Portuguese capital, veered off a steep stretch of tracks on Wednesday evening in one of Lisbon’s most popular tourist spots, crashing into a building.\n\nA woman interviewed by television channel SIC said the train, which can hold about 40 people, struck the building “with brutal force and collapsed like a cardboard box”.\n\nImages after the accident showed another funi­cular stopped on the tracks a few metres away on the tracks as tourists and onlookers watched, stunned.\n\nThe dead included two South Koreans and a Swiss national; 11 foreigners were among the injured\n\nLisbon Mayor Carlos Moedas called the incident a tragedy the likes of which “our city has never seen” before.\n\nFifteen people — eight men and seven women — were killed instantly and one person died later in hospital, emergency services said.\n\nOfficials had said that 17 people had been killed, but they later corrected the toll and clarified that one person had died in hospital after previously reporting two.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 5th, 2025",
