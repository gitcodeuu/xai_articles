  "content": "Security forces have killed 19 terrorists in three separate operations across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the military’s media wing said on Thursday.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), “On 9-10 September, nineteen Khwarij belonging to the Indian proxy, Fitna al Khwarij were sent to hell in three separate engagements in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.”\n\nThe state uses the term Fitna al Khwarij to refer to terrorists belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). It later designated Balochistan-based groups as Fitna-al-Hindustan to highlight India’s alleged role in terrorism and destabilisation across Pakistan.\n\nThe ISPR said that an intelligence-based operation was conducted in KP’s Mohmand district upon the reported presence of terrorists there.\n\n“During the conduct of [the] operation, own troops effectively engaged the khwarij’s* location, and after an intense fire exchange, fourteen Indian-sponsored khwarij were sent to hell.”\n\nIt added that another intelligence-based operation was conducted in the general Datta Khel area of the North Waziristan district, where, during the ensuing fire exchange, four more terrorists were neutralised by the security forces.\n\nIn another encounter that took place in Bannu district, one more terrorist was killed, the statement added.\n\n“Weapons and ammunition were also recovered from Indian-sponsored killed Khwarij, who remained actively involved in numerous terrorist activities in these areas,” the statement said.\n\n“Sanitisation operations are being conducted to eliminate any other kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country.”\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif commended the successful counter-terrorism operations.\n\nAccording to Radio Pakistan, President Zardari, in a statement, said the courage and professionalism of Pakistan’s brave soldiers continued to protect the nation from the scourge of terrorism.\n\n“He emphasised that such operations demonstrate Pakistan’s unshakeable resolve to confront and defeat Indian-sponsored terrorism,” the report said.\n\nPer the report, PM Shehbaz said, “The war against terrorism will continue until this scourge is completely eradicated from the country.”\n\n“Officers and personnel of the Pakistan Army are tirelessly engaged day and night to foil the nefarious designs of the Khawarij and the Fitna of Hindustan,” he was quoted as saying.\n\nPakistan has lately been witnessing an uptick in terrorist activities, mainly in KP and Balochistan. In November 2022, the TTP, after breaking a ceasefire deal with the government, had vowed to escalate attacks against the security forces, the police, and other law enforcement agencies’ personnel.\n\nLast week, six soldiers were martyred, while five terrorists were killed as security forces thwarted an attack on the Federal Constabulary (FC) Headquarters in the Bannu district.\n\nIn August, security forces neutralised 50 terrorists during a four-day operation in Balochistan.",
