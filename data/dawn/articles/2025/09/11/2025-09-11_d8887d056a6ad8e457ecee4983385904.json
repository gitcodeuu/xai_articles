The meeting is now set for Thursday.\n\nForeign Minister Ishaq Dar said Pakistan had formally requested an urgent UN Security Council session to take up Israel’s “aggression against Qatar as a grave threat to international peace and security”.\n\nHe also called on the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, on behalf of the Org­anisation of Islamic Coo­peration (OIC) and in coordination with Gulf states, to hold a debate on the strikes.\n\nThe upcoming UNSC meeting is expected to address the serious implications of the Israeli escalation and discuss appropriate international resp­onses.\n\nSaudi Crown Prince Moha­mmed Bin Salman also came out in support of Doha, saying that Riyadh rejected and condemned Israel’s “assaults” in the region.\n\n“The brutal aggression against the sisterly state of Qatar requires Arab, Islamic and international action,” he said in a televised address, calling on the international community to confront Israeli aggression.\n\nMeanwhile, the attack generated a flurry of diplomacy between Arab states. United Arab Emirates President She­ikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan led a delegation of some of his most senior ministers to Qatar on Wednesday, where he met with Qatari emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani and his cabinet.\n\nJordan’s Crown Prince Huss­ein is also expected to visit Qatar, while the Saudi crown prince is expected to arrive today Thursday, an official with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nThe visits, which were not previously scheduled, were a show of regional solidarity with Qatar following the Israeli strikes, the official said.\n\nCanada also said it was evaluating its relationship with Israel after the attack on Qatar, saying it considered the action unacceptable, especially given Qatari attempts to facilitate peace in the Middle East.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 11th, 2025",
