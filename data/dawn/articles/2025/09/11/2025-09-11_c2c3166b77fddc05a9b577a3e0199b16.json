  "content": "Hamas accused the United States on Thursday of complicity in Israel’s deadly attack on its negotiators in Qatar, lambasting Israel for seeking to kill off Gaza truce talks as Doha buried the dead.\n\nTuesday’s unprecedented Israeli strikes on a Gulf state sent shockwaves through a region long shielded from conflicts and halted already floundering Gaza talks.\n\n“This crime was … an assassination of the entire negotiation process and a deliberate targeting of the role of our mediating brothers in Qatar and Egypt,” Hamas official Fawzi Barhoum said in a televised statement.\n\nIn Doha, tight security surrounded the mosque where prayers were held as the Gulf state’s ruler joined mourners.\n\nOne coffin bearing a Qatari flag and five others bearing Palestinian flags were brought into the mosque, live footage from Qatar television showed.\n\nFacing the coffins, Qatar’s emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, prayed alongside dozens of mourners, some wearing traditional white robes, others wearing military uniforms.\n\nThe interior ministry said the dead would be buried in the Mesaimeer Cemetery after the funeral at Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdul Wahhab Mosque.\n\nAuthorities beefed up security, with checkpoints on access roads to the mosque.\n\nBarhoum accused Washington of being “a full accomplice” in the Israeli attack.\n\nThe White House said Trump did not agree with Israel’s decision to take military action.\n\nHe said he was not notified in advance and when he heard, he asked his envoy Steve Witkoff to warn Qatar immediately — but the attack had already started.\n\nIsrael said it targeted Hamas leaders, but the group said its top officials survived.\n\nHamas said five of its members were killed — top negotiator Khalil al-Hayya’s son Hamam, his office director Jihad Labad and bodyguards Ahmad Mamlouk, Abdallah Abdelwahd and Mumen Hassoun.\n\nQatari Lance Corporal Badr Saad Mohammed al-Humaidi al-Dosari was also killed.\n\nBarhoum said Hayya’s wife, his slain son’s wife and his grandchildren were wounded in the attack on the compound where he lived.\n\nIn an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said he could not confirm Hayya’s fate.\n\nThe Hamas chief negotiator was not seen at the funeral in the footage viewed by AFP.\n\nPictures shared on Hamas’s Telegram channel showed Osama Hamdan — a senior figure in the movement — attending the burial of the movement’s dead, along with political bureau member Izzat al-Rishq.\n\nA post by the group said several Hamas members were present at the funeral.\n\nSheikh Mohammed said the Israeli attack had killed any hope for Israeli hostages in Gaza, adding that Qatar was reevaluating “everything” surrounding its role as mediator in ceasefire talks.\n\nDoha has been a venue for several rounds of indirect negotiations between Hamas and Israel.\n\nThe emirate allowed Hamas to set up a political office in Doha in 2012 with the blessing of the US, which has sought to maintain a communication channel with the group.\n\nSheikh Mohammed said he hoped for a collective regional response to the attack and that an Arab-Islamic summit would be held in Doha to decide on a course of action.\n\nThe attack has drawn sharp condemnation and a show of solidarity from Gulf neighbours.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates said, “Any aggression against a Gulf Cooperation Council member state constitutes an attack on the collective Gulf security framework.”\n\nThe United Nations Security Council condemned the strikes but did not mention Israel in the statement that was agreed by all 15 members, including Israel’s ally, the US.\n\n“Council members underscored the importance of de-escalation and expressed their solidarity with Qatar. They underlined their support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Qatar,” read the statement, drafted by Britain and France.\n\n“Council members underscored that releasing the hostages, including those killed by Hamas, and ending the war and suffering in Gaza must remain our top priority,” it said.\n\nFormer Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was buried in Qatar after his assassination in Iran in July 2024 in an attack attributed to Israel.",
