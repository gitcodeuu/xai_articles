The D-8’s strategic goal is to boost intra-trade to $500bn by 2030 under its Decennial Roadmap and the D-8 Preferential Trade Agreement (PTA).\n\nMr Imam also noted that the Centre for SMEs, set up in Nigeria, is being developed into a hub of excellence focused on advancing innovation, financing, and digital integration. He described the D-8 SME Cooperation Framework as evolving into a key economic engine for sustainable development, job creation, and enhanced competitiveness.\n\nThe SMEDA chief executive highlighted that SMEs are projected to generate more than 70pc of new jobs by 2030. He expressed confidence that the D-8 SME Cooperation Framework would strengthen the internationalisation of SMEs, facilitate global value chain integration, and foster international market development. “Together, the D-8 countries, representing a market of over 1.3 billion people, have the potential to raise collective trade volume to $2 trillion,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 11th, 2025",
