  "content": "GWADAR: Balochistan High Court (BHC) Chief Justice Rozi Khan Bareach has urged the lawyers’ community to unite and work jointly to restore public trust, stressing that eliminating black sheep from both the judiciary and legal profession was the need of the hour.\n\n“Lawyers should remain within their jurisdiction and judges within theirs, because the real stakeholders are the people. Both lawyers and judges are servants of the people, and the greatest nationalism is to be honest and truthful with one’s own people,” he said while addressing a joint dinner hosted by Turbat, Gwadar and Panjgur bar associations on Wednesday.\n\nThe BHC chief justice said that most litigants approaching courts belong to poor segments of society and arrive with hopes of justice, yet they often face difficulties. To reduce these hardships, he announced the establishment of public convenience centres, including daycare facilities, shelter homes for women and waiting rooms.\n\nHe added that litigants would be treated with dignity and respect in courts, warning that strict action would be taken against any officer who ignored public dignity.\n\nJustice Bareach said the judiciary was introducing a self-accountability system for lawyers to expose mafias and black sheep in the profession. He noted that some mafias had even inducted their children into the legal field only to protect their black businesses, but such elements must now be removed from the system.\n\nHe cautioned the bar councils against corrupt practices to secure votes, saying vandalism, forgery and treason would not be tolerated. It was the duty of bar councils, he stressed, to weed out wrong elements and uphold the dignity of the profession.\n\nThe BHC chief justice also announced that, following the establishment of a copy branch, statements and paper boxes would be provided free of cost to poor litigants to remove barriers in accessing justice.\n\n“The honour of the ‘black coat’ lies in honesty and integrity. On the basis of this honour, the public entrusts lawyers with properties worth billions and with serious cases like murder. Damaging this trust amounts to damaging the entire system,” he observed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 11th, 2025",
