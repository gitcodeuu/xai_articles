Two of them were [found] dead,” he said, adding that four others were injured in the incident, including three children and a driver.\n\nHe also said that the dead bodies and the injured were taken to the Shenkiari Rural Health Centre, while two of the injured were later taken to the King Abdullah Teaching Hospital for further treatment.\n\nFatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.\n\nEarlier this month, two people were killed and 24 others sustained critical injuries when a wagon carrying participants of a wedding procession skidded off the road and plunged into a deep ravine in Balakot.\n\nAt least two local tourists were killed in an accident after their car plunged into a ravine in the Kaghan area in June.\n\nIn April, five people were killed and eight others were injured when a passenger jeep plunged into a ravine in Mansehra’s Jabori area of Siren Valley.",
