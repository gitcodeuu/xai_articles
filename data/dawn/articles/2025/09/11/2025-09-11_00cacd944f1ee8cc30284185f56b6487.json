Sharma Oli to resign.\n\nThe upheaval in the poor Himalayan nation was unleashed by a social media ban that was announced last week but was rolled back after 19 people were killed on Monday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to control crowds.\n\nThe death toll from the protests had risen to 25 by Wednesday, Nepal’s health ministry said, while 633 were injured.\n\nNepal’s army said that relevant parties were coordinating to tackle the situation after the protests and resolve the issue. Media also said preparations were being made for authorities and protesters to hold talks, without giving details.\n\nMost of the protesters were young people voicing frustration at the government’s perceived failure to fight corruption and boost economic opportunities, leading to the demonstrations being dubbed the “Gen Z protests”.\n\nThe young agitators want former chief justice Karki as the interim prime minister, said Raman Kumar Karna, the secretary of the Supreme Court Bar Associ­a­tion, who was consulted by the protesters.\n\n“When they requested me, I accepted,” Karki told Indian news channel CNN-News18.\n\n“Gen Z” representatives told reporters that they met army officials later and proposed Karki as their choice to head an interim government.\n\nMinisters’ homes set ablaze\n\nBurnt-out vehicles and twisted metal littered the area around parliament, where army firefighters battled to douse a blaze in the main hall, while the building’s exterior was charred after protesters set it ablaze on Tuesday.\n\nTV footage showed youths cleaning up some damaged buildings and clearing debris from roads and the areas near parliament.\n\nSeveral other government buildings, from the supreme court to ministers’ homes, including Oli’s private residence, were also set ablaze in the protests, with the unrest subsiding only after the resignation.\n\nArmoured vehicles kept vigil in streets that were largely deserted, with shops and markets shut. Firefighters were engaged at different locations, while the process of clearing roads was also under way, army spokesman Raja Ram Basnet said.\n\n“We are trying to normalise the situation first. We are committed to protect the life and property of people,” Basnet said, adding that prisoners had set Kathmandu’s Dilli Bazar Jail on fire before the army controlled the situation.\n\nNepali police said on Wednesday that more than 13,500 prisoners broke out of jails across the country during anti-government protests this week.\n\nThe main airport in Kathmandu also reopened on Wednesday, an airport spokesperson said, more than 24 hours after flights had been suspended.\n\nArmy warns of ‘strict action’ In a post on X, the army said prohibitory orders imposing a curfew would remain in force until Thursday morning.\n\n“Any demonstrations, vandalism, looting, arson, and attacks on individuals and property in the name of protest will be considered punishable crimes and strict action will be taken by security personnel,” the post said.\n\nFor years a lack of jobs has driven millions to seek work in countries such as Malaysia, the Middle East and South Korea, mainly on construction sites, so as to send money home.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 11th, 2025",
