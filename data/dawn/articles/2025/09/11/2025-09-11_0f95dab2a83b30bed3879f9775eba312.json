  "content": "United States investigators said on Thursday they had found the bolt-action rifle they believed was used to kill influential conservative activist Charlie Kirk as he gave a talk at a university in Utah, but were still searching for the shooter.\n\nKirk, an influential ally of President Donald Trump, was fatally shot on Wednesday while speaking at Utah University, sparking a manhunt for a lone sniper who the governor said had carried out a political assassination.\n\nAuthorities said they still had no suspect in custody as of Wednesday night, some eight hours after the midday shooting at Utah Valley University campus in Orem, Utah, during an event attended by 3,000 people.\n\nCellphone video clips of the killing posted online showed Kirk addressing a large outdoor crowd on the campus, about 64 kilometres south of Salt Lake City, around 12:20pm MT (18:20 GMT or 23:20 PKT), when a gunshot rang out.\n\nKirk, a staunch defender of gun rights, was answering an audience question about mass shootings when the bullet struck his neck; screaming audience members fled in panic.\n\nThe lone perpetrator suspected of firing the single gunshot that killed Kirk, 31, apparently from a distant rooftop sniper’s nest on campus, remained “at large”, said Beau Mason, commissioner of the Utah Department of Public Safety, at a news conference four hours later.\n\nMeanwhile, Robert Bohls, the FBI special agent in charge, told reporters: “The shooter jumped off the roof and fled into an adjoining neighbourhood.”\n\nInvestigators found a “high-powered, bolt-action” rifle in a nearby wooded area and were examining that along with palm prints and footprints for clues.\n\nThe shooter appears to be of college age and “blended in well” on the campus, Mason added. The shooter has not been publicly identified, and while investigators said they had “good video footage”, they would not make that public for now.\n\nState police issued a statement on Wednesday night saying that two men had been detained and one was interrogated by law enforcement, but both were subsequently released.\n\n“There are no current ties to the shooting with either of these individuals,” the statement said. “There is an ongoing investigation and manhunt for the shooter.”\n\nTrump said today he would award Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honour, making the remarks during a ceremony at The Pentagon commemorating the 9/11 attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, Vice President JD Vance cancelled his trip to New York to commemorate the attacks by Al Qaeda on September 11, 2001, and instead will travel to Utah to visit Kirk’s family, a person familiar with the situation said.\n\n“So much of the success we’ve had in this administration traces directly to Charlie’s ability to organise and convene,” Vance wrote in a lengthy tribute posted on social media. “He didn’t just help us win in 2024, he helped us staff the entire government.”\n\nIn a video message taped in the Oval Office and posted to Trump’s Truth Social online platform, the president vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.\n\n“My administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it,” Trump said.\n\nJeff Long, chief of the university police department, said he had six officers working the event and coordinated with the head of Kirk’s private security team, which was also on site. Trump ordered US flags flown at half-staff until Sunday in Kirk’s honour.\n\nThe killing was the latest in a series of attacks on US political figures, including two assassination attempts on Trump last year, that have underscored a sharp rise in political violence.\n\n“This is a dark day for our state, it’s a tragic day for our nation,” Utah’s Republican Governor Spencer Cox said at the press conference. “I want to be very clear that this is a political assassination.”\n\nWith the suspect still at large, there was no clear evidence of a motive for the act of violence.\n\nTrump, who routinely describes political rivals, judges and others who stand in his way as “radical left lunatics” and warns that they pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric.\n\n“For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the world’s worst mass murderers and criminals,” Trump said in the video. “This kind of rhetoric is directly responsible for the terrorism that we’re seeing in our country today, and it must stop right now.”\n\nOn Capitol Hill in Washington, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the US House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing.\n\nKirk’s appearance on Wednesday was the first in a planned 15-event “American Comeback Tour” at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported today that investigators found ammunition engraved with expressions of transgender and antifascist ideology inside the rifle that authorities believe was used to shoot Kirk, according to an internal law-enforcement bulletin and a person familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe older-model .30 calibre hunting rifle was discovered in the woods near the scene of the shooting, wrapped in a towel with a spent cartridge still in the chamber, the sources said. There were also three unspent rounds in the magazine, all with wording on them.\n\nSeconds before he was shot, the married father of two young children was being questioned by an audience member about gun violence, according to multiple videos of the event posted online.\n\n“Do you know how many mass shooters there have been in America in the last 10 years?” Kirk was asked.\n\nHe responded, “Counting or not counting gang violence?” He was shot moments later.\n\nKirk and the group he co-founded, Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.\n\nAfter winning his second presidential term, Trump credited Kirk for mobilising younger voters and voters of colour in support of his campaign.\n\n“You had Turning Point’s grassroots armies,” Trump said at a rally in Phoenix in December. “It’s not my victory, it’s your victory.”\n\nKirk had 5.3 million followers on X and hosted a popular podcast and radio programme, ‘The Charlie Kirk Show’. He had also recently appeared as a guest co-host on Fox News’ ‘Fox & Friends’. He was part of an ecosystem of pro-Trump conservative influencers, including Jack Posobiec, Laura Loomer, Candace Owens and others, who helped to amplify the president’s agenda.\n\nKirk frequently attacked mainstream media and engaged in culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.\n\nAt the White House, staff members, many of them young and admirers of Kirk, were ashen-faced as news of the shooting spread.\n\nRepublican and Democratic politicians alike expressed dismay over the shooting.\n\nDemocratic House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement, “Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values. We pray for his family during this tragedy.”\n\nThe US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s. Reuters has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nIn July 2024, Trump was grazed by a gunman’s bullet during a campaign event in Butler, Pennsylvania. A second assassination attempt two months later was foiled by federal agents, with opening arguments in that suspect’s trial set to begin on Thursday.\n\nIn April, an arsonist broke into Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence and set it on fire while the family was inside.\n\nEarlier this year, a gunman posing as a police officer in Minnesota murdered Democratic state lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband and shot Democratic Senator John Hoffman and his wife. And in Boulder, Colorado, a man used a makeshift flamethrower and Molotov cocktails to attack a solidarity event for Israeli hostages, killing one woman and injuring at least six more.\n\nIn 2022, a man broke into Democratic then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s home and bludgeoned her husband with a hammer, leaving him with skull fractures and other injuries.\n\nIn 2020, a group of right-wing militia members plotted unsuccessfully to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat.",
