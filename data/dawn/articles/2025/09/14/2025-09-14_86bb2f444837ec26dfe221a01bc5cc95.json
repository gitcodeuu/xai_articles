  "content": "The third and final Twenty20 International between England and South Africa was abandoned without a ball being bowled at Trent Bridge on Sunday as rain had the final say in the series that finishes 1-1.\n\nSouth Africa claimed a rain-reduced five-over contest by 14 runs in the opening game in Cardiff on Wednesday, before England registered a record 146-run win in the second fixture in Manchester on Friday as Phil Salt scored an unbeaten 141.\n\nThat result set up a grand finale on Sunday, but persistent rain in Nottingham delayed the toss and ultimately meant no play was possible.\n\nSouth Africa won the One Day International series between the sides 2-1.\n\nEngland now move on to a three-match T20 series against Ireland that starts in Dublin on Wednesday.",
