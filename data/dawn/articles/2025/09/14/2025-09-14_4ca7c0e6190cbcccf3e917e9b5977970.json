However, he stressed that digital or virtual currencies, by design, are difficult to regulate.\n\n“Cryptocurrencies flourish because they leave no trail. A currency born unregulated cannot be regulated,” he argued. While the US market has seen widespread adoption, he noted, the difference lies in the freer foreign exchange regime. In Pakistan, commercial banks cannot buy and sell dollars without the State Bank’s permission.\n\nSays Pakistan cannot regulate virtual currencies under current system; nearly 9m Pakistanis hold digital assets\n\nTrust and acceptance\n\nMr Zaidi estimated that around nine million Pakistanis hold or trade virtual currencies, primarily Bitcoin, a decentralised digital asset where transactions are recorded on a blockchain and issuance is independent of any central bank.\n\nHe added that digital currencies are already being used to settle transactions, including under-invoicing in trade with China, in ways similar to the hawala system. “This is not about being too fast or too slow in adoption. The reality is that our system cannot regulate it,” he said.\n\nHe emphasised that all currencies are built on trust, pointing to the US dollar today and the British pound in the past. Similarly, a trusted digital currency could emerge as a medium of payment worldwide.\n\nHe suggested that asset-backed cryptocurrencies could, in theory, be issued, but demand would remain weak since unregulated digital assets allow holders to convert black money into white.\n\nCiting examples abroad, he noted that India had formally rejected cryptocurrencies, while in the US, they continue to grow in popularity.\n\nHe also linked cryptocurrencies to political debates in the US, claiming that former president Donald Trump’s administration supported them after facing resistance from the Federal Reserve. Mr Zaidi quoted a banker as saying the Trump family earned $2.4bn through virtual currencies during their time in office.\n\nDigitisation versus crypto\n\nWhile acknowledging Pakistan’s progress in digitising its financial system, Mr Zaidi underlined that crypto belongs to a different domain.\n\n“Digitisation is about documentation and traceability. Crypto thrives on the opposite — anonymity and lack of control,” he said.\n\nExperts at the session noted that the use of virtual currencies in Pakistan is likely to continue growing, particularly as tight foreign exchange controls limit other avenues for cross-border payments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 14th, 2025",
