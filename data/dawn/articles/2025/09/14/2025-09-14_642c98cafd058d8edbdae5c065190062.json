ZERO sympathy,” she said on Facebook after the killing, which happened Wednesday in front of a large crowd at a university in Utah.\n\nRepublican US Senator Marsha Blackburn quickly called out the comment — and Sosh-Lightsy.\n\n“This person should be ashamed of her post. She should be removed from her position,” the Tennessee lawmaker said.\n\nMiddle Tennessee State University’s president announced that same night an employee’s firing for a “callous” comment about Kirk.\n\nKirk, who rallied his millions of followers to help President Donald Trump win a second White House term, was both revered and reviled for his pro-gun, anti-abortion and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\n\nShooting suspect Tyler Robinson, who was arrested Thursday, is said to have engraved anti-fascist messages on his bullet casings. This has led to a large part of the American right labelling him a “far-left” killer.\n\nSome Kirk supporters have turned into online sleuths, searching out accounts that praised or celebrated Kirk’s murder.\n\n“If they have their picture on their profile, even without a name, download the picture and reverse image search it,” conservative influencer Joey Mannarino said.\n\n“Cross-reference it with their LinkedIn profile and find their place of employment. Call the place of employment, leave Google reviews.”\n\nThese efforts have targeted teachers, firefighters and even military personnel, some of whom have lost their jobs.\n\nKirk’s murder has been condemned by both sides of the political aisle. But Trump quickly blamed the country’s “radical left,” even as authorities were only just launching a manhunt for the killer.\n\nOnline trackers have targeted an Oklahoma teacher, who posted on social media: “Charlie Kirk died the same way he lived: bringing out the worst in people.”\n\nThat teacher has since been investigated by the state’s Department of Education, which described his comments as “abhorrent.”\n\nTrump, who praised Kirk as a “giant of his generation,” has led the US government in memorialising the activist, with high-ranking US officials working to weed out critics of Kirk and his legacy.\n\nTrump ordered flags lowered to half-staff in honour of his ally, and Kirk’s body was flown from Utah to his home in Phoenix, Arizona, aboard Air Force Two, escorted by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nMeanwhile, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered members of the military to identify colleagues who mocked or celebrated Kirk’s death.\n\nUS Under Secretary of State Christopher Landau declared that “foreigners who glorify violence and hatred are not welcome visitors to our country.”\n\n“I have been disgusted to see some on social media praising, rationalising, or making light of the event, and have directed our consular officials to undertake appropriate action,” he said in a post on X.\n\n“Please feel free to bring such comments by foreigners to my attention so the @statedept can protect the American people.”\n\nLaura Loomer, a far-right conspiracy theorist who has Trump’s ear, has been one of the most high-profile attackers of Kirk’s critics.\n\nShe denounced an employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), who had expressed disgust on Instagram that flags would be lowered for “the literal racist homophobe misogynist.”\n\nLoomer shared the staffer’s LinkedIn profile and said: “These people hate us. They don’t belong near the levers of our National Power.”\n\nFollowing Loomer’s post, FEMA said the employee was placed on leave for making “revolting and unconscionable” comments.\n\nOn Saturday, Kirk’s organisation, Turning Point USA, announced that a memorial service for its founder will be held on September 21 in a suburb of Phoenix.\n\nThe chosen venue hints at the expected turnout: a stadium normally home to a professional football team, with a seating capacity of more than 63,000.",
