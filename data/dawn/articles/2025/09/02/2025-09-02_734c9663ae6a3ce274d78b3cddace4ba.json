The CPO also directed them to submit a daily report to the Ministry of Interior, the inspector general of police (IGP) and the regional police officer.\n\nFollowing the government’s directive, police teams have been formed to launch searches for illegal foreigners in the district.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 2nd, 2025",
