We have encroached riverbeds,” he said, adding that this was the third or fourth such disaster in last 12 to 14 years.\n\nWithout naming anyone, he said when someone would be obliged to build a housing society on a riverbed, nature would react.\n\n“In KP also, the people had encroached natural flow of rivers. What steps we have taken to remove encroachments on waterways after the country faced similar floods some three years back. He said they would face such tragedies again and again if they did not change their way.\n\nHighlighting damages caused by floods in his home constituency, Mr Asif alleged a “contracting company” had destroyed his city of Sialkot.\n\n“They are influential people and sitting in the Senate,” he said, pointing the finger at Zahir Khan and Bros (ZKB).\n\nIt was unfortunate that all big dams had been built by military dictators, while politicians had built hotels on riverbeds, he regretted.\n\nHe suggested building hundreds of small dams and reservoirs, instead of waiting for decades to build mega projects, warning that water would become an extremely scarce commodity in the future.\n\nHe was of the opinion that they needed to build small dams, which could be completed within a year or two.\n\n“Do not do politics on it. We have political differences, but climate is a national, rather international issue, and it needs a national response,” he said.\n\nLG system\n\n“A comprehensive and robust local government system is needed to serve the masses in the cities, villages and tehsils,” said the minister amid desk-thumping by the members, regretting that presently there were no local body institutions in Punjab and other parts of the country.\n\nThe local bodies were essential for disaster management, he said, adding that power must be dispersed to towns, villages, tehsils and districts.\n\nEarlier, Ali Muhammad Khan of the PTI said the federal government should come forward to help KP people. He called for a detailed parliamentary discussion on water issues and the need for building new dams.\n\n“The whole house should think over it as to how we can build dams and reservoirs. There should be no politics on the issue of dams,” the PTI leader said.\n\nHe asked the federal government to complete work on Mohmand Dam project that had been started by the PTI’s government.\n\nHe said political parties had failed to build even a single big water reservoir.\n\nPTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan drew the attention of the house towards the flood devastations in his Buner constituency, stating that 240 people had died and another 120 were still missing.\n\nHe said the party had suspended its political activities in Punjab due to flood situation.\n\nHe praised the KP government and the armed forces for their role in the rescue efforts in the province.\n\nHe, however, termed the assistance so far provided by the federal government “insufficient”.\n\nPPP’s Naveed Qamar urged collective national action against climate change and environmental mismanagement.\n\nThe PPP leader warned that floods could be 22pc more destructive next year, while in the long term, melting glaciers might dry up the Indus and other rivers, turning fertile lands into deserts and threatening centuries-old ecosystems.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 2nd, 2025",
