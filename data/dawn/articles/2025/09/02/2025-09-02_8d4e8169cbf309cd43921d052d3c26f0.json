The change boosted Indian clusters, while those in the European Union — where the venture capital markets are sometimes less vigorous than in the United States — have tended to see a decline.\n\nMost innovation clusters\n\nThe top 100 innovation clusters are spread across 33 economies, uniting “top universities, researchers, inventors, venture capitalists and research and development firms in driving forward breakthrough ideas”, WIPO said.\n\nBy country, China for the third consecutive year led the ranking with the most clusters in the top 100, at 24, followed by the United States with 22 clusters.\n\nWIPO said the clusters with the most innovation-intensive activity in proportion to population size were San Jose-San Francisco in the United States, followed by Britain’s Cambridge.\n\nTop 15\n\nThe top 15 innovation clusters in 2025: 1: Shenzhen-Hong Kong-Guangzhou (China) 2: Tokyo-Yokohama (Japan) 3: San Jose-San Francisco (United States) 4: Beijing (China) 5: Seoul (South Korea) 6: Shanghai-Suzhou (China) 7: New York City (United States) 8: London (Britain) 9: Boston-Cambridge (United States) 10: Los Angeles (United States) 11: Osaka-Kobe-Kyoto (Japan) 12: Paris (France) 13: Hangzhou (China) 14: San Diego (United States) 15: Nanjing (China).\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 2nd, 2025",
