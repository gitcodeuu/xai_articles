Sources at the hospital said the injured officer was in critical condition.\n\nFollowing the attack, a large number of security forces and police cordoned off the area and launched an operation to trace facilitators, according to official sources.\n\nWitnesses said the exch­ange of fire caused panic in the area, leading to the closure of shops and hou­ses. However, they later pra­ised the police for their response.\n\n“The personnel risked their lives and sav­ed the entire area from a major disaster,” they said.\n\nThe funeral prayers for the martyred police official, Nizamullah, was later offered at Governor Cottage in Miramshah.\n\nIt was attended by senior government and military officials, as well as a large number of local residents.\n\nHe was presented a gua­rd of honour by a police contingent and laid to rest with official honours.\n\n“Our son sacrificed his life for the sake of the country and we are proud of his martyrdom, but the government should also pay attention to problems of the martyrs’ families,” family members told the media.\n\nLocal tribal elders also demanded that the government ensure the upbringing of the constable’s children and provide immediate financial assistance to the family.\n\nPolice officials said an investigation is underway.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 2nd, 2025",
