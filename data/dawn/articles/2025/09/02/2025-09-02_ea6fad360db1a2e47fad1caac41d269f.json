Two months later, an ODI debut followed.\n\n“To my family and friends, who stood with me in moments of joy and in ther deepest of trials, including the loss of my beloved daughter during the World Cup, your strength carried me forward,” he said.\n\nHe added: “I retire with immense gratitude, and InshaAllah will continue to share my passion for the game by playing domestic and league cricket worldwide.”\n\nPrimarily utilised as a finisher and power hitter, Asif Ali carved out a niche in Pakistan’s middle order, boasting strike rates of 133.87 in T20Is and 121.65 in ODIs, the International Cricket Council (ICC) said.\n\nHis standout moment came at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2021 against Afghanistan, where he produced a breathtaking cameo that remains etched in memory.\n\nWith Pakistan needing 24 off 12 balls, Ali hammered four sixes in the penultimate over off Karim Janat, racing to 25 from just 7 deliveries and sealing the chase with an over to spare, a knock that proved pivotal in Pakistan’s march to the semi-finals.\n\nAsif was fined by the ICC for a fiery on-field spat with Fareed Ahmad of Afghanistan in their thrilling Asia Cup match in Sharjah.\n\nThe Pakistan Cricket Board thanked Asif for his services to Pakistan cricket in a post on X.\n\nTeammate and all-rounder Shadab Khan extended best wishes to Asif for the next chapter in his career.\n\n“Happy retirement to one of the best teammates and a brother. Best wishes for the next chapter in your career, Asif bhai!” he said in a post on X.",
