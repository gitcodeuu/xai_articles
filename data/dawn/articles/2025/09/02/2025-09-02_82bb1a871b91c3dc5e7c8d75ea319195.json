Such relatively shallow quakes can cause more damage, especially since the majority of Afghans live in low-rise, mud-brick homes vulnerable to collapse.\n\nSome of the most severely impacted villages in remote Kunar provinces “remain inaccessible due to road blockages”, the UN migration agency warned.\n\nNangarhar and Kunar provinces, which border Pakistan, were also hit by flooding in recent days, authorities said.\n\nRescuers were battling to reach remote mountainous areas cut off from mobile networks along the border, where mudbrick homes dotting the slopes collapsed in the quake.\n\n“The area of the earthquake was affected by heavy rain in the last 24-48 hours as well, so the risk of landslides and rock slides is also quite significant — that is why many of the roads are impassable,” Kate Carey, an officer at the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), told Reuters.\n\nRescue teams and authorities are trying to dispose of animal carcasses quickly so as to minimise the risk of contamination to water resources, Carey said.\n\nCasualties could rise as rescue teams access more isolated locations, authorities said.\n\nTaliban’s defence ministry said at least 40 flight sorties had been carried out on Monday.\n\nA member of the agricultural department in Nurgal said people had rushed to clear blocked roads in the hours after the earthquake, but that badly affected areas were remote and had limited telecoms networks.\n\n“There is a lot of fear and tension… Children and women were screaming. We had never experienced anything like this in our lives,” Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad said.\n\nHe said that many living in quake-hit villages were among the more than four million Afghan refugees who have returned to the country from Pakistan and Iran after decades. “They wanted to build their homes here.”\n\nCondolences pour in\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed deep condolences, on behalf of the people of Pakistan, to the families who lost their loved ones in the earthquake. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government decided to immediately dispatch a consignment of essential medicines to earthquake-stricken reg­ions of Afghanistan, with Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announcing that the provincial government was fully prepared to also deploy medical staff.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 2nd, 2025",
