AFP pictures showed people blocking roads by placing stones, which they were also pelting, and burning objects.\n\nAt 12pm, the National Highways and Motorways Police said the N-25 highway near Baleli Custom in Quetta was closed due to a “public protest”.\n\nParts of the N-25 highway, which extends from Karachi to Quetta, were also blocked near Hub and Mastung’s Sona Khan area, the motorway police said in the morning.\n\nThe Tehreek-i-Tahafuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan (TTAP) alliance — which the PTI, PkMAP and BNP-M are a part of — shared purported pictures on its X account of closed shops in Awaran.\n\nIn another post, it claimed that the Western Bypass in Quetta was “completely shut”. “Violence and shelling by the police on PTI workers. The workers are continuing to resist the police shelling,” it added.\n\nThe opposition parties had declared that highways, intercity roads and routes leading to Quetta airport and railway station would be blocked during the strike. Other airports in the province would also be shut, they added, urging the business community and transporters to support the strike.\n\nThe Quetta Chamber of Commerce and Industry, along with other business associations, had announced the closure of businesses across the province in solidarity with the victims of the suicide bombing. The Private Schools Association also declared that all private schools, colleges, and universities would remain closed.\n\nLast night, the Balochistan government warned protesters of “strict and immediate action” if they tried to disrupt law and order, or block roads and highways.\n\nFifteen people lost their lives, while 38 were injured in the blast that targeted a rally held at Quetta’s Shahwani Stadium to mark the fourth death anniversary of former Balochistan chief minister Sardar Attaullah Mengal, a veteran nationalist leader and BNP founder.\n\nSubsequently, Pashtunkhwa Milli Awami Par­ty (PkMAP) Chairman Mah­mood Khan Achakzai, BNP-M Chief Sar­dar Akhtar Mengal, along with lea­ders of the PTI, Awami National Party (ANP), National Party (NP) and Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM), had announced the strike at a joint press conference.\n\nMengal, calling the stadium bombing a “painful and tragic act”, had criticised the state for not fulfilling its “duty” to protect the gathering. Mengal, Achakzai, former NP senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai had remained unhurt in the suicide attack as they had left the venue just a few minutes before the blast.",
