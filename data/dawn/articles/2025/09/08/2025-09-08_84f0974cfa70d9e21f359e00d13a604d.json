A trailing truck was unable to stop and slammed into the car, smashing the smaller vehicle.\n\nThe family members, who belonged to the Janwri community in the Luqman area of Khairpur, died at the scene. The accident took place within the jurisdiction of the Sadhuja police station in the Naushahro Feroze district.\n\nTwo of the victims were identified as Ghulam Mohammed and Ali Ahmed. It may be noted that one track of the national highway was severely damaged and under repair, forcing traffic from both directions to use a single lane.\n\nRescue teams arrived at the scene, and efforts were underway to recover the bodies.­\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 8th, 2025",
