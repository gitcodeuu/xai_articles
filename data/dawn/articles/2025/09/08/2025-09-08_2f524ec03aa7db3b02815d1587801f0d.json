Those heading to North Nazimabad Blocks N, H, I can take routes through Imtiaz Store, Mujahid Colony, and Peoples Chowrangi.\n\n“On Sharea Faisal and in District East, areas such as Nursery, Baloch Colony, Karsaz, and Drigh Road Underpass are expected to be heavily affected,” the advisory read.\n\nTravellers going to and from Jinnah International Airport were asked to use alternative routes via Tariq Road, Stadium Road, Johar Chowrangi, and Shahrah-e-Bhutto.\n\nLast month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.\n\nMost of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.",
