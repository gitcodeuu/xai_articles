A copy is available with Dawn.com.\n\nThe complainant, who was at the scene, alleged in the FIR that the suspects approached his sons’ fruit carts on Sunday evening to buy some fruit. The vendors refused to sell, claiming that the suspects would not pay for the items. This dispute escalated, with the suspects allegedly abusing the fruit vendors.\n\n“The suspects drew their weapons and shot one of my sons in the hand and the left side of his chest,” the complainant alleged. “His brother was shot twice in the chest, while my third son was shot once in the arm and three times in the stomach.”\n\nAccording to the FIR, the complainant and other people tried to transport the victims to THQ Hospital in Sangla Hill, but one of the deceased succumbed to his wounds on the way, while the other was pronounced dead upon arrival. The third victim was in critical condition, so he was referred to Allied Hospital in Faisalabad for treatment.\n\nMore to follow.",
