Two people were also injured when a five-storey building in Jakarta partially collapsed two years earlier.\n\nTeenagers rehearsing for a musical show were among seven people killed in Cirebon, east of Jakarta, in 2018 when the building they were in collapsed.\n\nAt least 75 people were also injured the same year when a mezzanine floor at Indonesia’s stock exchange building in Jakarta collapsed into the lobby.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 8th, 2025",
