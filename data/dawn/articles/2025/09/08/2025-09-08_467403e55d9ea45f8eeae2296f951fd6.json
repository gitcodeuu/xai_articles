The added discharges pushed Punjab’s water levels even higher.\n\nFor the first time in the country’s 78-year history, three eastern rivers — the Sutlej, Jhelum and Chenab — are simultaneously at “exceptionally” high flood levels, according to local authorities.\n\nIn Gilgit-Baltistan, sudden glacial lake outburst floods added another layer of devastation, tearing through remote valleys and destroying homes, water systems and power lines. These floods occur when rains or rising temperatures cause mountain lakes to burst, releasing torrents of water and debris with little warning.\n\nThe UN says climate change is accelerating glacial melt across the Himalaya and Hindu Kush ranges, creating more unstable lakes and heightening the risk of such disasters.\n\n“Unpredictable and intense weather patterns, shrinking agriculture, sea erosion, unemployment, and lingering dry spells have caused widespread migration within Pakistan in the past decade,” Hafiz Wasi Mohammad Khan, a member of the Punjab Agriculture Research Board, told Anadolu.\n\n“We fear that this process would be further accelerated by the latest floods.”\n\nHe estimated that although temporary migration will be higher, around 25 per cent of the displaced people may never be able to return to their homes.\n\nEarlier this year, the Climate Risk Index ranked Pakistan as the country most affected by climate change in 2022.\n\nExperts also point to human-driven vulnerabilities such as unchecked land grabs and illegal constructions along natural drainage paths, which the government has vowed to address.\n\n“Pakistan stands where it was in 2010 in terms of handling floods,” Khan said. “I suspect we will be discussing the same situation next year.”\n\nIn 2010, more than 2m people were displaced by floods that inundated one-fifth of the country. Of those, 70pc permanently settled in big cities because of the destruction of their homes and farmlands, according to the climate change ministry.\n\nKhan warned that another wave of mass migration to already-overcrowded cities would not only add to their strained infrastructure but also fuel crime and deepen poverty.\n\n“An enormous challenge is ahead in terms of rehabilitation and food security. The affected families have lost everything — their homes, lands, livestock and piled up stocks,” he said, adding that farmers urgently need cash inputs to procure seeds and other agricultural supplies.\n\nHe noted that many communities, especially downstream, have learned from recurring floods over the past two decades. In some cases, they even view them as opportunities, as floods can regenerate land and replenish underground water levels.\n\nChadhar called for the establishment of a “special agriculture fund” to help farmers, in addition to writing off their loans and utility bills, saying the government cannot handle the challenge of rehabilitation alone.\n\nMeanwhile, Farid Abdulkadir Aiywar, IFRC head of delegation for Pakistan, urged the international community not to overlook the unfolding tragedy that is “quietly but relentlessly” devastating communities across the country.\n\n“The crisis is far from over,” he told reporters on Friday. “Entire communities remain underwater, families have lost everything, and access to safe water and health care is becoming more urgent by the day.”\n\nPunjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority Director General Irfan Ali Kathia, however, downplayed the chances of a large migration toward urban centres.\n\n“This time, there will be no mass migration by [flood-affected people] as the government is set to announce a massive rehabilitation package for them, which will cover everything — from their crops and land losses to home destruction,” Kathia told Anadolu.",
