However, apart from SCBA, the committee has not received any other suggestions.\n\nThe committee had formulated the draft with an aim to enhance transparency, efficiency and overall effectiveness in judicial proceedings. It had invited proposals from judges, office of the Supreme Court, bar councils and associations, keeping in view modern legal requirements and the need for streamlined procedures.\n\nOnce the new rules were uploaded on the Supreme Court’s website, various stakeholders, including bar councils and associations raised concerns. Some senior judges were also of the opinion that instead of circulating the draft, the proposals should be discussed in a session of the full court.\n\nThe full court, comprising all Supreme Court judges, will meet on Sept 8 (today) at the start of the new judicial year. The meeting will be held on the administrative side in the committee room, not in Courtroom No. 1. Deliberations are expected to begin at 1:00 pm, with the CJP presiding, and will focus solely on written suggestions submitted by SCBA and earlier statements issued by the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC).\n\nIt is also expected that a newly-built facility centre in the Supreme Court building will be inaugurated on the occasion of the new judicial year.\n\nOn Sept 3, SCBA proposed open inquiries by the Supreme Judicial Council (SJC) into complaints against superior court judges, arguing that open hearings would not only ensure accountability but also uphold the constitutional guarantees of equality before law under Article 25 and the right to fair trial under Article 10A.\n\nAccording to SCBA, once a complaint is admitted, the SJC should hold open proceedings subject to safeguards of dignity and decorum and decide references within a fixed time frame, preferably six months.\n\nThe key reform proposals include rationalisation of court fees demanding withdrawal of the recent increase to ensure inexpensive justice, as seen in Norway and Germany, where only nominal fees are charged.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 8th, 2025",
