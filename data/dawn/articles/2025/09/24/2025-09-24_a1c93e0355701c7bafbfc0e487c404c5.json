My nephew also called the branch manager and told him to stay away from her.\n\n“When my daughter went to work on September 23 (Tuesday), the manager called my nephew and said, ‘You didn’t come to me, do whatever you want’,” the complainant added. “My sister, nephews and I went to the office at 9pm, but the doors were locked. They were keeping my daughter hostage.”\n\nThe complainant alleged that the branch manager hurled abuse while another person drew a gun on them and fired shots when he and his nephews broke down the door and entered the premises.\n\n“My nephew returned fire, while the office guard also drew his weapon and began firing,” the complainant said.\n\nAccording to the FIR, someone reported the gunshots on the police helpline and personnel soon arrived at the scene, arresting five people for the firing, while three others were detained for causing the incident.\n\nIt added that the police also seized weapons and ammunition from the suspects.\n\nIn February, a young man was arrested in Karachi’s DHA after shooting and wounding two policemen while resisting arrest in connection with a kidnapping for ransom case. The shooter was later sent on remand by an anti-terrorism court for the incident and has a litany of charges against him, including cybercrime and the attempted murder of a journalist.",
