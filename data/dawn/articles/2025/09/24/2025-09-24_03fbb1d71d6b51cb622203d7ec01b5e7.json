The project is expected to start by the end of 2025 after completion of necessary formalities. He announ­ced that permanent repair work on the existing storage infrastructure would be carried out and comp­leted within the next four to five months to ens­ure smooth export operations.\n\nIn another development, the Port Qasim Authority will collaborate with the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association on possible use of the currently underutilised Sahiwal berth for clinker exports.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",
