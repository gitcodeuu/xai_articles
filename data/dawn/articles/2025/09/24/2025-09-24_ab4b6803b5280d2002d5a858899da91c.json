India are the current holders and beat Pakistan in both previous matches, but Shaheen was in a bullish mood after taking 3-28 against Sri Lanka.\n\nWhen asked about Pakistan and India not facing off in any of the finals of the previous editions and the possibility of both rivals meeting in the final, Shaheen said, “They have still not reached the final. When they do, we will see accordingly.\n\n“We are here to win the cup; whichever team comes in the final, we are ready to beat them.”\n\nAsked about criticism regarding the players showing aggression on the field, the left-arm pacer said, “Honestly, our job is to play cricket and win tournaments … everyone is respectable and people think according to their own mindset.\n\n“We came here to win the tri-series and won that. Now we are trying our best to win the tournament (Asia Cup) and make the nation happy.”\n\nIf both teams reach the final, India will once again start as favourites, having won 12 of 15 T20Is between the two countries. India has also won the last seven internationals against Pakistan since September 2022, four T20Is and three one-day internationals.\n\nPakistan still has a lead in the overall record against India across all three formats, with 88 wins against India’s 79 victories.\n\nIndia skipper Suryakumar Yadav had claimed that India-Pakistan “is not a rivalry anymore”.\n\nIn both wins for India in the UAE, there were no handshakes, adding another layer to an already intense rivalry.\n\n“It is his opinion that, let him say that,” said Shaheen of Suryakumar’s comments.\n\n“When they reach the final, then [they] will see. Our job is to win the Asia Cup, and we will make a complete effort to do that.“",
