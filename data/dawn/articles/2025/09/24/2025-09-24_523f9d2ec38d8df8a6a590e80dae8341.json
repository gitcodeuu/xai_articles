They found that a teacher, Ahmed Bashir, had allegedly tortured a 10-year-old orphan boy, Shahzad.\n\nThe police arrested Bashir, who confessed to be a caretaker at the foundation.\n\nA First Information Report (FIR) was filed under section 323-A of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC). The police say that most of the children in the orphanage were being subjected to physical abuse on a daily basis.\n\nMeanwhile, CPB District Officer Muhammad Adnan, who came to know about the issue through social media, directed the bureau’s Legal Officer Ali Akbar to approach the court for a search order.\n\nAccordingly, Mr Akbar approached Additional Sessions Judge Muhammad Farrukh Hameed, seeking a search order for the foundation.\n\nAfter getting the search order from the court, a CPB team raided the foundation’s premises and rescued 18 children detained there, all under the age of 10.\n\nCPB officials say that 17 of the recovered children are from different districts of Balochistan, and one from Chichawatni.\n\nThe CPB investigations revealed that the foundation is not a registered body and its owners are from Islamabad.\n\nPolice say that the foundation owners, caretakers and management fled the premises before the raid.\n\nDPO Tahir stated that police are investigating the matter.\n\nMr Adnan told Dawn that the recovered children have been lodged in the CPB’s district office, where they are being provided food and clothes, adding that all of them would be presented in the court on Wednesday (today).\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",
