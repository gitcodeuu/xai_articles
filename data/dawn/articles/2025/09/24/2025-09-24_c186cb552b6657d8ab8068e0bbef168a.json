The cause of death was determined to be massive head trauma inflicted by a hard and blunt object.\n\nArea SHO Rizwan Patel said that the boy went missing from the Landhi area. His father, Mohammed Salman, had lodged an FIR on Sept 18 under Section 364-A of the Pakistan Penal Code and Section 3(i) of the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act, 2018.\n\nThe police had launched a search by utilising intelligence sources in different areas and on Monday, at around 9:15pm, the body, stuffed in a gunny bag, was recovered from an empty plot in the 4-B area of Landhi.\n\nThe officer said that the police conducted an action and arrested two suspects from the same area, who were allegedly involved in the rape-cum-murder.\n\nThe SHO said both the suspects were “familiar” with the victim.\n\nMeanwhile, the Saudabad police on Tuesday registered a case against a man and his two sons for their alleged involvement in an armed attack on journalist and anchorperson Imtiaz Ali Meer over what they called a land dispute.\n\nMr Meer and his brother Mohammed Salih were shot at and wounded when armed men resorted to indiscriminate firing on their car on main National Highway near Kala Board.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",
