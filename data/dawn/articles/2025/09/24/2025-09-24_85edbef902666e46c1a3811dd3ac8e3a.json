  "content": "BRUSSELS: Nato warned Russia on Tuesday that it would use “all necessary military and non-military tools” to defend itself as it condemned Moscow for violating Estonian airspace in “a pattern of increasingly irresponsible behaviour”.\n\nThe warning came days after Estonia said three Russian MiG-31 jets violated its airspace for 12 minutes before Nato Italian fighter jets escorted them out.\n\nOn Tuesday, US President Donald Trump called for Nato countries to shoot down any Russian jets that violate their airspace.\n\nOn his Truth Social network, Trump also said Ukraine with the EU’s support could win back all of its territory from Russia — and even go further — in a major pivot after meeting President Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nThe Nato warning followed a meeting of the North Atlantic Cou­ncil, made up of ambassadors from the alliance’s 32 member countries, which was called after Estonia invoked Article 4 of Nato’s founding treaty.\n\nTrump urges Nato to shoot down Russian jets for airspace violation\n\n“Russia bears full responsibility for these actions, which are escalatory, risk miscalculation and endanger lives. They must stop,” the council said in a statement.\n\n“Russia should be in no doubt: Nato and Allies will employ, in accordance with international law, all necessary military and non-military tools to defend ourselves and deter all threats from all directions,” the statement said.\n\n“We will continue to respond in the manner, timing, and domain of our choosing.” The recent incidents have prompted calls from some European politicians and analysts for Nato to shoot down manned Russian fighters that intrude on the alliance’s airspace. But German Defence Minister Boris Pistorius warned against such talk.\n\n“Reckless demands to shoot something out of the sky or to send a specific message of strength do not help in this situation. We need to be calm, clear and prudent — and act appropriately,” he told reporters in Berlin after a meeting with his Swedish counterpart.\n\nAt alliance headquarters in Brussels, Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte said the Russian jets over Estonia had not been shot down as they had tbeen assessed not to pose an immediate threat. But he said Nato commanders had the authority to “take the ultimate decision” if they assessed that intruding aircraft did pose such a threat.\n\n‘Not naive alliance’\n\nNato’s Article 4 states that allies will “consult together whenever, in the opinion of any of them, the territorial integrity, political independence or security” of a member is threatened. It is only the ninth time in Nato’s 76-year history that the article has been invoked — and two of those occasions have come this month in response to the incidents over Poland and Estonia. “We are a defensive alliance, yes, but we are not naive. So we see what is happening,” Rutte said.\n\n“If it is not intentional, then it is blatantly incompetent. And of course, even if it is incompetence, we still have to defend ourselves.” Russia said on Monday that Estonia’s assertion that Russian jets violated Estonian airspace was unfounded and accused Tallinn of seeking to ratchet up East-West tensions.\n\nNato also said its members would not be deterred from continuing to support Ukraine “in the exercise of its inherent right to self-defence against Russias brutal and unprovoked war of aggression”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",
