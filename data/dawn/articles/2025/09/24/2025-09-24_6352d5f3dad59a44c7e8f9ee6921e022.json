This is a core part of our commitment to fuel Pakistan’s digital transformation, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to enhance their productivity, creativity, and learning with AI,” Qureshi was quoted as saying.\n\nThe plan includes the following features:\n\nMoreover, the statement added: “Users can share all of these benefits — from Gemini in Workspace to the 200 GB of storage — with up to five other family members.”\n\nThis, as per Google, is “an easy way for everyone to enjoy an upgraded Google experience with a single plan”.\n\n“Google AI Plus is available in Pakistan starting today for Rs1,400 per month,” said the statement. “For a limited time, first-time subscribers will get 50 per cent off for the first six months.”\n\nIn July, Information Technology Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja met with Google’s Regional AI Developer Ecosystem and Communities team to explore strategic collaboration in advancing Pakistan’s AI landscape.\n\nShe had stressed the government’s focus on AI training in education and the workforce",
