The crossing was closed following the shooting.\n\nA spokesperson for the Israeli authority overseeing the Allenby crossing said it would be closed from Wednesday morning “at the direction of the political leadership”.\n\nRally in occupied West Bank\n\nCrowds of people rallied in the occupied West Bank on Tuesday, waving flags and holding posters of President Mahmud Abbas to celebrate the wave of recognition by Western powers of a Palestinian state.\n\nNationalist slogans blared from loudspeakers across the central square in Ramallah, where a crowd of more than 100 clutched Palestinian and European flags alongside signs reading “stop the genocide”.\n\nHigh-ranking officials from Abbas’s political movement, Fatah, and the Palestinian Authority — which exerts limited control in the occupied territory — shook hands and smiled.\n\n“This recognition is a first step in a process that we hope will continue,” Jibril Rajoub, secretary general of Fatah’s central committee, said.\n\n“It is the result of more than a century of resistance and determination by our people.”\n\nRajoub said he had felt moved listening to the speeches made at the UN General Assembly in New York the night before.\n\n“We must learn from the past and unite the people,” he said.\n\nMaysoon Mahmud, 39, who is also a Fatah member, said: “We came here today to thank the countries that have recognised Palestine, but also to ask them to continue to support us in stopping the war.\n\n“It is time for the world to take responsibility.”\n\nFurther north in Tulkarem, dozens more gathered, holding the flags of countries that now recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nBut many Palestinians expressed ambivalence at the move due to the bitter reality on the ground.\n\nRoula Ghaneb, an academic from Tulkarem, stood impassively in the middle of the Ramallah rally, holding a photo of her 20-year-old son, Yazan.\n\n“He was arrested at our home eight months ago,” she said, adding that he was being held in poor conditions.\n\nGhaneb said she wanted an end to all violence, insisting: “We don’t want words, we want action.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 24th, 2025",
