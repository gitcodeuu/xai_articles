It was a spontaneous thought to celebrate that way — I don’t care for what people are making of it.”\n\nHe added that Fakhar’s role from the other end gave him confidence to play his shots.\n\nIn Pakistan’s last match against India, the bitterness between the two sides — which started with India’s refusal of customary handshakes in the first encounter — had continued as Abhishek Sharma at the post-match ceremony said: “Today (Sunday) it was very simple, the way they (Pakistan) were coming (at) us for no reason, I didn’t like it at all, and this is the only way I could give [an answer] with my bat.”\n\nPakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking after the match, had said, “We are yet to play the perfect game. We batted really well — but I think when it came to the bowling, they took the game away in the powerplay.”\n\nEarlier, Bangladesh beat Sri Lanka by four wickets in their match in Dubai on Saturday.\n\nThe top two teams from Super Four will play the Asia Cup final in Dubai on September 28.",
