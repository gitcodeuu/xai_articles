It is up to it to quickly take the concrete steps in the coming days to avert snapback. If not, then sanctions will be reimposed,” said one of the diplomats.\n\nIf Tehran and the E3 fail to reach a deal on an extension by the end of September 27, then all UN sanctions will be reimposed on Iran, where the economy already struggles with crippling sanctions reimposed since 2018 after President Donald Trump ditched the pact during his first term.\n\nIranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said on Saturday that Iran would overcome any reimposition of UN sanctions, but one insider said mounting discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy was rattling the Islamic Republic, with little sign that its leaders have the answers.\n\nSoon after the US and Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear sites in June, Iran’s parliament passed a law suspending cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and stipulating that any inspections must be approved by Iran’s Supreme National Security Council.\n\nOn September 9, the IAEA and Tehran reached a deal to resume inspections at nuclear sites.\n\n“I am in New York to use these remaining days for diplomatic consultations that might lead to a solution … if it is not found, we will continue our path,” Araqchi said.\n\nMeanwhile, Grossi told AFP that diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute over Iran’s nuclear programme were at a “difficult juncture” but dialogue would continue.\n\nThe UN Security Council voted on Friday to reimpose UN sanctions that had been frozen, after three European governments activated the “snapback” mechanism in a decade-old nuclear agreement, accusing Iran of non-compliance.\n\n“It’s obviously quite a difficult juncture. It’s a very difficult situation we are facing right now,” the IAEA chief said, adding that talks between the involved parties were planned in New York for today.\n\n“What’s important is the communications are continuing. We are planning to see each other if possible today, Monday, here in New York, and perhaps more meetings during the week.”\n\nFriday’s vote means that the sanctions, which were suspended in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear activities set out in the 2015 deal, will take effect again on September 28 unless Iran can persuade the council to relent in the next week.\n\nTehran said the action by the European powers — Britain, France and Germany — undermined months of engagement with the IAEA aimed at resuming monitoring and ensuring compliance with international rules.\n\nGrossi praised the active diplomacy of French President Emmanuel Macron to salvage a deal, and said that there were still lines of communication between Tehran and Washington.\n\n“Emmanuel Macron is very present, has been historically, and I respect him enormously,” Grossi said.\n\n“I think the special envoy, Ambassador [Steve] Witkoff, has also been involved and actively exploring different channels and presenting a number of ideas,” Grossi said.\n\nGrossi said his dialogue with Witkoff had enabled him to understand Washington’s position and red lines.\n\n“And the IAEA is not a party to the agreement — but it’s indispensable in every scenario. So we continue the work with Ambassador Witkoff,” Grossi said.\n\nWestern governments have long accused Iran of seeking a nuclear weapons capability, an ambition Tehran denies.\n\nTehran has also criticised the IAEA for failing to condemn the Israeli and US strikes.\n\nParis, London, and Berlin have stressed their demands that the Islamic Republic grant IAEA inspectors full access to nuclear sites, including those damaged by Israeli and American attacks last June.\n\nThey also call for a resumption of negotiations, particularly with the US side.\n\nTehran says it is resisting political pressure and accuses the Europeans of not taking up a “balanced” proposal, the details of which have not been disclosed.\n\n“We are not at a point where people are not talking to each other, and you have to convince them to come together,” Grossi said.\n\n“So does that mean that I am optimistic? Well, neither optimistic nor pessimistic,” he said, adding that he remained hopeful that “we can still have an agreement”.\n\n“If we don’t have it, I think we have to try to (right) the boat as soon as possible to avoid prolonged confrontation and perhaps more attacks.” Grossi also said he would seek to succeed Antonio Guterres as secretary general of the UN when his term ends in December 2026.",
