While Islamabad asserts it had interrupted polio transmission from 2021 to 2023, the IMB said this was likely an inadvertent result of Covid restrictions, that were “hostile to poliovirus spread”, rather than an outcome of programmatic improvements.\n\nThe operating environment for polio is constantly shifting. After the IMB meeting and as the report was being finalised, there were: two serious monsoon-related floods in different parts of Pakistan, an earthquake in Afghanistan, a child malnutrition crisis in Borno and a potential peace settlement in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.\n\nA Pakistani polio expert, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, agreed with the IMB’s assessment, highlighting an absence of accountability, innovation, and integration.\n\n“Interestingly, as usual, government’s ownership despite PM’s intense engagement has been questioned,” the expert said. “This IMB report questions the money and time spent against the targets and in midst of virus circulation and resurfacing has questions the viability of the program.”\n\nAs a solution, the expert suggested “shifting the management and ownership in real sense to the government, restructuring the program, integrating with EPI and holding the chronic poor performers to account at the high level can address the issues”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 22nd, 2025",
