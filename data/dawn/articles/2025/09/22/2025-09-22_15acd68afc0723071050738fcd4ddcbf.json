She was taken out of the ground on a stretcher, but returned later in the innings.\n\nSouth Africa began briskly, reaching 38 without loss in 6.3 overs through skipper Wolvaardt’s 28 off 23 balls, which comprised of six fours.\n\nSouth Africa’s promising start was disrupted when Laura hit one straight to Muneeba off Diana Baig.\n\nNashra then ran through the South African batting line-up to take 5-8 in her next six overs as South Africa slumped from 61-3 to 94-8.\n\nAll-rounder Syeda Aroob Shah — returning after two years — picked up the last two wickets to wrap up South Africa’s innings as they registered their second-lowest ODI score in the last five years.\n\nSidra Amin top-scored for the Women in Green again with an unbeaten 50 that anchored the innings after some early jitters — ending her series with two centuries and a 50.\n\nIn the second ODI on Friday, the Women in Green were all set to chase South Africa’s daunting 313-run total, but fell 25 runs short.\n\nA spectacular knock by Sidra Amin, who became the first Pakistani batter to score consecutive centuries, brought them close, but in the end, the Duckworth-Lewis method adjusted the 313-run target was a step too far.\n\nSetting a mammoth score to chase after the Proteas batters ruled the roost in the first innings, Sidra stepped up again under the Gaddafi Stadium lights to score a sublime hundred — but failed to close the chase.\n\nThe Proteas had sailed to an easy victory over Pakistan after chasing down a target of 256 to win by eight wickets in the first ODI of their series in Lahore on Tuesday.\n\nThe ODIs were all staged at the Gaddafi Stadium, with the first ball of all matches bowled at 3:30pm.\n\nPakistan’s 15-member squad was captained by Fatima, while Laura Wolvaardt lead the visiting side. In the build-up to the series, Pakistan held a two-week pre-series camp in Lahore, which included practice sessions and scenario-based matches.\n\nThe squad featured one uncapped player, Eyman Fatima, who recently made her T20I debut against Ireland in Dublin in August.\n\nThe series provides both sides with an opportunity to finalise preparations for the eight-team World Cup, set to take place from September 30 to November 2 in India and Sri Lanka. Pakistan will play all their matches in Sri Lanka.\n\nHead-to-head, in 28 ODI matches, South Africa had an upper hand against Pakistan, but the last time both sides met, Pakistan defeated South Africa by eight wickets in the ICC Women’s Championship 2022-25 series fixture at the National Stadium in Karachi on Sept 14, 2023.\n\nNashra Sandhu bowls in Pakistan’s final one-day international (ODI) against South Africa in Lahore on September 22. — X/PCB",
