  "content": "China’s top internet regulator announced on Monday a sweeping two-month crackdown on social media, vowing to combat content containing “malicious incitement of conflict” and “negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.\n\nBeijing requires social media companies to moderate content on their platforms, with posts strictly controlled to avoid anything deemed to be too subversive, vulgar, pornographic or generally harmful.\n\nThe notice from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) follows announcements of penalties this month against three popular digital platforms, which it said had neglected content management duties.\n\nOn Saturday, the CAC said it would carry out “disciplinary and punitive measures” against micro-blogging platform Weibo and short video platform Kuaishou, accusing them of highlighting celebrity news and “undesirable” content.\n\nThe announcement followed similar action taken by the CAC on September 11 against the Instagram-like Xiaohongshu, known as Rednote in English.\n\nAuthorities have not specified what punitive actions are being taken against the three platforms.\n\nThe two-month campaign — whose start date was not specified in Monday’s statement — aims “to regulate the malicious incitement of conflict and the promotion of violence and vicious currents”, the CAC said.\n\nThe statement then listed specific online issues authorities hope to tackle in the crackdown.\n\nThey include “exploiting social hot spots to forcibly associate identity, region or gender with other information, stigmatising and hyping them”.\n\nIn practice, this could mean a clampdown on posts about discrimination. In July, local officials in eastern Zhejiang province warned comedians against stirring up gender discord through stand-up routines that joked about the battle of the sexes.\n\nOther problems targeted by the campaign include disseminating “rumours” about the economy, finance, social welfare and public policy.\n\nWeibo has previously warned against posting “pessimistic” views about the economy, social media users told AFP in late 2023.\n\nMonday’s notice also mentioned “maliciously interpreting social phenomena, unilaterally exaggerating negative individual cases and exploiting them to promote negative outlooks on life such as world-weariness”.\n\nThat could be seen as a reference to “lying flat” or “letting it rot” culture widespread phrases used by young Chinese to describe lifestyles that snub gruelling work culture in favour of taking it easy.\n\nThe crackdown aims to “foster a more civilised and rational online environment”, the statement said.",
