The PTI leadership also expressed deep sympathy with them for the loss of their livestock, houses and crops.\n\nIt said that full assistance will be provided to flood victims in KP and for this purpose data is being compiled.\n\n“It is the responsibility of the federal and provincial governments to declare a flood emergency in the country and immediately compensate for the losses suffered by the people,” the spokesperson said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 22nd, 2025",
