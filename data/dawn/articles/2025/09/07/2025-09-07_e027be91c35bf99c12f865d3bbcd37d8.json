I was making videos and uploading to my TikTok account. I will not make such videos in the future.”\n\nSHO Amin said that the content creator had been presented in a local court and “would face the law of the land”.\n\nDSP Abazai said that it was very sad that he was making videos in Swabi’s traditional chail, a chador proudly worn by women in the district. Aziz Manerwal, a renowned writer, told Dawn.com about the significance of the chail.\n\n“No one can deny the importance of the Swabi chail. It has cultural and traditional significance,” he said.\n\n“The women here wear it with great pride. It is said that a battle took place here in history, and when women placed their white shawls on the dead bodies of their husbands, they would create red dots, and since then, women here have been wearing white shawls with red dots.”",
