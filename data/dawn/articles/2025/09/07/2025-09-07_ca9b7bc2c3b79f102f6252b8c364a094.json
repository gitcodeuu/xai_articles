  "content": "Russia fired its biggest-ever aerial barrage at Ukraine early on Sunday, killing four people and setting government offices in Kyiv ablaze, an attack Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned would prolong the war.\n\nFlames could be seen rising from the roof of the sprawling government complex that houses Ukraine’s cabinet of ministers in the heart of the city — the first time it has been hit during the three-and-a-half-year conflict.\n\nDrone strikes also damaged several high-rise buildings in the Ukrainian capital, according to emergency services.\n\nRussia has shown no sign of halting its onslaught despite efforts by the United States to broker a peace deal, and Kyiv residents have become hardened to the daily rhythm of strikes and alerts.\n\n“This is already routine for us, unfortunately,” Olga, a 30-year-old resident of a damaged building, told AFP after the latest strikes. An AFP reporter saw helicopters dropping buckets of water over the government building’s roof, as emergency services rushed to the scene.\n\nRussia denies targeting civilians in Ukraine.\n\nIt said it struck a plant and a logistics hub in Kyiv, with the Russian defence ministry saying “no strikes were carried out on other targets within the boundaries of Kyiv”.\n\nUkrainian Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko posted a video showing a damaged floor in the government building.\n\n“We will restore the buildings,” she said. “But we cannot bring back lost lives. The enemy terrorises and kills our people every day throughout the country.”\n\nRussia fired at least 810 drones and 13 missiles at Ukraine between late Saturday and early Sunday in a new record, according to the Ukrainian air force.\n\n“Such killings now, when real diplomacy could have already begun long ago, are a deliberate crime and a prolongation of the war,” Zelensky said.\n\nHe discussed the attack in a call with French President Emmanuel Macron and said France would help Ukraine strengthen its defence.\n\nMacron was among European leaders condemning the attack, posting on X that Russia was “locking itself ever deeper into the logic of war and terror”.\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the attacks “cowardly” while EU chief Ursula von der Leyen accused the Kremlin of “mocking diplomacy”.\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said Washington was prepared to increase pressure on Russia by slapping tariffs on countries that buy Russian oil.\n\n“The Russian economy will be in full collapse. And that will bring President (Vladimir) Putin to the table,” Bessent told NBC Television.\n\nAt least two people were killed in a strike west of Kyiv, prosecutors said. More than two dozen were wounded in Kyiv, according to the emergency services.\n\nAmong them was a 24-year-old pregnant woman who delivered a premature baby shortly after the attack, with doctors fighting to save her life and that of her baby, state TV Suspilne reported.\n\nTwo more died and dozens were wounded in overnight strikes across the east and southeast, authorities said. Ukraine’s foreign ministry highlighted that seven horses had also been killed at an equestrian club.\n\n“The world cannot stand aside while a terrorist state takes lives — human or animal — every single day,” it posted on X.\n\nThe barrage came after more than two dozen European countries pledged to oversee any agreement to end the war, some of whom said they were willing to deploy troops on the ground.\n\nUkraine has insisted on Western-backed security guarantees to prevent future Russian attacks, but Putin has warned that any Western troops in Ukraine would be unacceptable and legitimate targets.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has tried to find a way to end the war in recent weeks but has little to show for his efforts.\n\nOn Sunday, Trump said he was prepared to move forward on new sanctions on Moscow, hours after Russia’s aerial barrage.\n\nSpeaking outside the White House, he replied “yeah, I am” when asked if he was ready to impose more sanctions against Russia, without giving further details.\n\nRussia has continued to claim territory in costly grinding battles and now occupies around 20 per cent of Ukraine. Tens of thousands have been killed and millions forced from their homes in Europe’s bloodiest conflict since World War II.",
