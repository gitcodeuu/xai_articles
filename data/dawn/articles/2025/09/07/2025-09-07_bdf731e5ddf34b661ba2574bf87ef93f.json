  "content": "Parts of Karachi received rain on Sunday evening as the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) forecast that the fresh rain spell in the city would continue till September 11 (Thursday).\n\nIt would witness “rain-wind/thundershowers with a few moderate to isolated heavy falls/ very heavy falls”, the forecast said.\n\nAccording to DawnNewsTV, Bahria Town, Liaquatabad, FB Area and North Karachi began receiving rain today evening. Rainfall was also reported in North Nazimabad, Scheme-33, Gulshan-i-Hadeed and the M-9 motorway.\n\nAccording to the forecast by the Met Office, this spell of rain will possibly continue till Thursday “with occasional gaps” and may cause urban flooding and waterlogging in low-lying areas.\n\nAt 5pm, the Met Office issued a weather warning, directing all concerned authorities to remain on high alert for the duration of the rain spell.\n\nEarlier, the Met Office also predicted “widespread rain wind/thundershower with scattered heavy to very heavy falls” in Sindh’s Tharparkar, Umerkot, Mirpurkhas, Sanghar, Khairpur, Shaheed Benazirabad, Dadu, Mitiari, Tando Muhammad Khan, Tando Allahyar, Hyderabad, Thatta, Badin, Sujawal and Jamshoro till Thursday with occasional gaps.\n\nIt has also forecast “widespread rain wind/ thundershower with scattered moderate to isolated heavy falls” in Larkana, Shikarpur, Kashmore, Sukkur, Jacobabad and Ghotki districts of Sindh till Thursday with occasional gaps.\n\nMeanwhile, DawnNewsTV reported that a fresh spell of rains had also begun in Umerkot, Tharparkar and Tando Muhammad Khan.\n\nIn the wake of the ongoing rains in Karachi, Mayor Murtaza Wahab said that all teams are on alert.\n\n“Municipal services staff are present at selected locations with machinery,” Wahab was quoted as having said in a press statement.\n\nRapid response teams have also been deployed to deal with any emergency situation, he added.\n\n“Along with this, city wardens and anti-encroachment staff will also be present on the roads for the relief of citizens,” the Karachi mayor said.\n\nThe staff should be in constant contact with the officers; strict action will be taken in case of negligence, according to Wahab.\n\n“A rain emergency centre will be established in case of further or heavy rain,” he continued.\n\nHowever, the rainfall in Karachi turned the weather pleasant, as its citizens welcomed the decline in mercury.\n\nLast month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.\n\nMost of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.",
