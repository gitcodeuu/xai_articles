The ministry said that Brazilian democracy would not be intimidated by the US.\n\nPresident Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also said he does not fear new sanctions from the US in an interview to local TV channel Band, hours before Bolsonaro’s conviction was confirmed.\n\nThe verdict was not unanimous, with Justice Luiz Fux on Wednesday breaking with his peers by acquitting the former president of all charges and questioning the court’s jurisdiction.\n\nThat single vote could open a path to challenges to the ruling, which could push the trial’s conclusion closer to the October 2026 presidential election. Bolsonaro has repeatedly said he will be a candidate in that election despite being barred from running for office.\n\nBolsonaro’s lawyers said in a statement that the sentencing was absurdly excessive and that they would file the appropriate appeals.\n\nThe conviction of Bolsonaro marks the nadir in his trajectory from the back benches of Congress to his forging of a powerful conservative coalition that tested the limits of the country’s young democratic institutions.\n\nHis political journey began in the 1980s on the Rio de Janeiro city council after a brief career as an army paratrooper. He went on to serve nearly three decades as a congressman in Brasilia, where he quickly became known for his defence of authoritarian-era policies.\n\nIn one interview, he argued that Brazil would only change “on the day that we break out in civil war here and do the job that the military regime didn’t do: killing 30,000”.\n\nLong dismissed as a fringe player, he later refined his message to play up anti-corruption and pro-family values themes.\n\nHe found fertile ground as mass protests erupted across Brazil in 2014 and 2015 amid the sprawling “Car Wash” graft scandal that implicated hundreds of politicians, including President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, whose own conviction was later annulled.\n\nAnti-establishment anger opened the path for his successful 2018 presidential run, with dozens of far-right and conservative lawmakers elected on his coattails. They have reshaped Congress into an enduring obstacle to Lula’s progressive agenda.\n\nBolsonaro’s presidency was marked by intense scepticism of vaccines during the pandemic and an embrace of illegal mining and cattle ranching in the Amazon rainforest, where deforestation climbed.\n\nAs he faced a tough reelection campaign against Lula in 2022 — which Lula went on to win — Bolsonaro’s comments took on an increasingly messianic quality, raising concerns about his willingness to accept the results.\n\n“I have three alternatives for my future: being arrested, killed or victory,” he said, in remarks to a meeting of evangelical leaders in 2021. “No man on Earth will threaten me.”\n\nIn 2023, Brazil’s electoral court barred him from public office until 2030 for venting unfounded claims about Brazil’s electronic voting system.\n\nLula’s Institutional Relations Minister Gleisi Hoffmann said that Bolsonaro’s conviction “ensures that no one dares again to attack the rule of law or the will of the people as expressed at the ballot box”.\n\nBolsonaro’s conviction and its durability will be a powerful test for the strategy that Brazil’s highest-ranking judges have adopted to protect the country’s democracy against what they describe as dangerous attacks by the far-right.\n\nTheir targets have included social media platforms they accused of spreading disinformation about the electoral system, as well as politicians and activists who have attacked the court. Sending the former president and his allies to jail for planning a coup reflects a culmination of that polarising strategy.\n\nThe cases have largely been led by the commanding figure of Justice Alexandre de Moraes, appointed to the court by a conservative president in 2017, whose hardball approach to Bolsonaro and his allies has been celebrated by the left and denounced by the right as political persecution.\n\n“They want to get me out of the political game next year,” Bolsonaro told Reuters in a recent interview, referring to the 2026 election in which Lula is likely to seek a fourth term. “Without me in the race, Lula could beat anyone.”\n\nThe historic significance of the case goes beyond the former president and his movement, said Carlos Fico, a historian who studies Brazil’s military at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nThe supreme court also ruled to convict seven of Bolsonaro’s allies, including five military officers.\n\nThe verdict marks the first time since Brazil became a republic almost 140 years ago that military officials have been punished for attempting to overthrow democracy.\n\n“The trial is a wake-up call for the armed forces,” Fico said. “They must be realising that something has changed, given that there was never any punishment before, and now there is.”",
