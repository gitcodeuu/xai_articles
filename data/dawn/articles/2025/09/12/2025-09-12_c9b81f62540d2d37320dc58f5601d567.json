The association “notes with dismay that it has been a full year since it submitted its second petition to the Israeli Supreme Court for free and independent access to Gaza”, the statement said.\n\n“Despite the urgency, the court has repeatedly agreed to the government’s request for delays and postponed one hearing after another.”\n\nThe association also slammed Israel for targeting Palestinian journalists operating inside Gaza. “Palestinian journalists have been directly targeted. Places where they habitually gathered have been bombed,” it said, adding that at least 200 of them have been killed by Israeli fire.\n\n“Despite all of these dangers, they continue to inform the world while facing not only violence, but also hunger and repeated displacement.”\n\nLast month, Israeli strikes on a hospital in Gaza killed more than 20 people, including five journalists, according to local authorities.\n\nThe FPA also criticised Israeli leaders and the military for going to “extreme lengths to discredit the work of our Palestinian colleagues, and to a great extent, the work of the foreign press as a whole”.\n\nNew dilemma for Palestinians\n\nPalestinians in the relatively unscathed Al-Naser area of Gaza City were having to decide whether to stay or go on Thursday after the Israeli military dropped leaflets warning that troops would take control of the western neighbourhood.\n\nIsrael has ordered the hundreds of thousands of people living in Gaza City to leave as it intensifies its all-out war on the Palestinian group Hamas, but with little safety, space and food in the rest of Gaza, people face dire choices.\n\n“It has been almost two years, with no rest, no settling down, not even sleep,” said Ahmed Al-Dayeh, a father, as he and his family prepared to flee the city in a truck pulled by a motorcycle, laden with some of their belongings.\n\n“Our life revolves around war,” he said. “We have to go from this area to that area. We can’t take it anymore, we are tired.”\n\nIsraeli strikes killed 34 people across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, according to medics and local health authorities, including 22 in Gaza City and 12 in the central and southern parts of the territory.\n\nSeven of those killed were searching for food when they were hit, the Palestinian officials said.\n\nIsraeli ground troops had operated in parts of Al-Naser at the start of the war in October 2023, and the leaflets dropped late on Wednesday left residents fearful that tanks would soon advance to occupy the entire neighbourhood. On Wedn­esday, the Israeli military said it struck 360 targets in Gaza.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 12th, 2025",
