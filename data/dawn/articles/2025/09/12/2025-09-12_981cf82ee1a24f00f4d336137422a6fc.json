The homecoming process got under way on Thursday.\n\nReturn allowed after removal of terrorists\n\nThey, however, told Dawn that scores of families of those areas had safely returned to their homes after remaining displaced for over a month in line with the district administration’s orders issued for their safety during the anti-terrorist operation.\n\nResidents said both Lowi Mamund and War Mamund tehsils had recorded the safe return of people in large numbers along with their belongings on Thursday around a month after their evacuation.\n\nThey told Dawn that most residents, who were extremely excited to return, expressed immense gratitude on entering their homes. Some, mostly the elderly, even offered prayers of thanksgiving on seeing their homes safe after a month.\n\nA number of displaced people who returned to their houses in those areas told Dawn on Thursday evening that they were overjoyed to be back to their houses after spending over a month in relief camps and relatives’ homes outside their native localities.\n\n“We are deeply grateful to the Almighty Allah for allowing us to return to our homes after spending over a month in relief camps and relatives’ homes outside our areas, which had been our most challenging time since the last operation was carried out against terrorists in the region in 2008,” a returnee said.\n\nHe and other residents praised authorities for clearing their areas of terrorists and enabling them to return home at the earliest, saying they hadn’t expected to be able to go back home so soon.\n\nThey said all people from the areas recently declared free of terrorists were eager to return, and for it, authorities had to arrange transportation to ensure their safe and early arrival.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 12th, 2025",
