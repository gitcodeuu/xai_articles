  "content": "KARACHI: The foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) increased by $34 million during the week ending Sept 5.\n\nAccording to the central bank, total reserves rose to $14.336 billion. However, the SBP did not disclose the source of the latest increase.\n\nIt is customary for the SBP to purchase US dollars from the interbank market, and these purchases have been rising. During FY25, the central bank bought $7.8bn from the banking market.\n\nDespite continued dollar buying, the SBP has not yet recovered to the reserve level recorded at the close of FY25, which stood above $14.5bn.\n\nThe country’s total foreign exchange reserves stand at $19.68bn, including $5.344bn held by commercial banks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 12th, 2025",
