They added that effective surveillance of the border would also help in declining new recruits from Afghanistan.\n\nThese officials believe that with the new operational strategy, LEAs would be in a better position to conduct intelligence-based operations with minimum chances of collateral damage and less opposition from locals, who had been opposing large scale military operations and their forced displacement.\n\nThey said that in order to effectively tackle and inflict losses on terrorists groups, LEAs were working on a strategy to provide an escape route to those militants, who had either taken refuge in populated areas or taken locals as hostages.\n\n“At present they are restricted in a bowl where they would either put up resistance or would make locals hostages to use them as a human shield or they would remain dormant,” said officials. They added that once terrorists tried to leave their temporary abodes, they would be effectively eliminated with remote chances of any collateral damage.\n\n“This is a new approach within the domain of operational readiness or framework while this strategy varies from area to area with no specific focus on any one particular region or locality,” they said.\n\nAuthorities in May had conveyed to the elders of Tirah and Bara an official message about the launch of a full scale military operation in parts of Tirah where TTP, Lashkar-i-Islam and Hafiz Gul Bahadar group had established their bases and also started receiving Islamic tax (Ushr) on the profit that locals had earned from sale of poppy and other contraband.\n\nThose groups had also established parallel courts where locals were compelled to bring their disputes for adjudication in light of the teachings of Sharia, said sources.\n\nThe message about full scale military operation, conveyed through commissioner of Peshawar during at least three official meetings till mid June, was rejected by the elders of both Tirah and Bara.\n\nLocals also opposed their forced displacement prior to the start of any military offensive against outlawed groups in Tirah.\n\nProvincial Disaster Management Authority has also established a registration centre for the families to be evicted from Tirah in Paindi Cheena locality but not a single family has so far registered itself at the centre despite a lapse of four months.\n\nOfficials, however, refuted the impression that change in border security strategy was introduced owing to resistance by locals of military operations and their refusal to vacate their houses under pressure from security forces.\n\nThey said that security forces would conduct military operations with slight modifications when the situation in any particular area became unavoidable and locals would be shifted to a comparatively safe place for a short duration of time.\n\nMeanwhile, information gathered from different parts of Tirah speak of a calm but uncertain situation as according to locals, militant groups continue to patrol the areas under their influence while the movement of security forces is restricted to their fortified bases.\n\nSecurity officials in Bagh Maidan Markaz of Tirah had recently conveyed to local elders that no forced displacement would be conducted in Tirah nor would local tribes be compelled to form tribal Lashkars to fight against outlawed militant groups.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 15th, 2025",
