A subsequent proposal to increase the rate to Rs550 was deferred in 2025, and no new resolution has been passed since then, read the notice.\n\n“The KE, which only acts as a collection agent on behalf of the KMC, has no legal authority to alter or enhance MUCT rates,” said Mr Saifuddin.\n\nHe said the arbitrary hike not only burdened citizens of Karachi, but also undermined the authority of the elected City Council and insulted the public mandate.\n\nCity Mayor Murtaza Wahab, however, expressed his “wonders” over “unawareness” of the opposition and its leaders about the “facts and procedures”.\n\n“This increase has in fact been approved by the City Council in the budget session,” he told Dawn.“So this argument doesn’t stand that it’s a violation of the rules.”\n\nHe continued: “Secondly we only increased slab for the industrial and commercial users. The reason is this segment of the city is more prone to fire and other incidents where the municipal resources and utilities are spent more. We should not mislead people only for political point scoring.”\n\n‘No new charges’\n\nKMC officials claimed that no new charges were being imposed under the MUCT head.\n\n“Historically, industrial and commercial consumers were charged up to Rs5,000 under the same category,” said an official.\n\nThe slab for industrial and commercial consumers had initially been reduced to Rs400 by the mayor, but it was being revised upward in the latest budget, he added.\n\n“The funds collected through this municipal tax will be utilised for essential services, including the fire brigade and road maintenance,” added the official.\n\nThe KMC in August 2024 formally notified the collection of MUCT through K-Electric.\n\nThe KMC and the KE had signed an agreement in June 2022 which finally became effective from July 2024 after the City Council approved the levy.\n\nThe consumers are charged as per category, which is notified by the KMC from time to time.\n\nReferring to different slabs of the MUCT, an official said that the KE consumers receiving bills of up to 100 units remain exempted from the taxes and those consuming units between 101 and 200 pay Rs20 every month.\n\nThose consuming units between 201 and 300 pay Rs40 and those consuming between 301 and 400 units pay Rs100 through their KE bills.\n\nThe KE consumers consuming 401-500 units pay Rs125, the consumers of units between 501 and 600 pay Rs150, the consumers of 601 and 700 units pay Rs175 and those consuming more than 700 units pay Rs300 in their monthly bills.\n\nAll categories of commercial and industrial consumers pay Rs400 each with their electricity bills.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 15th, 2025",
