People say that Israel has repeatedly hit so-called humanitarian zones.\n\nIn a post on X, UNRWA says Israel’s bombardment of Gaza City has been “constant” on Sunday, adding that there is “no safe place” in the besieged enclave.\n\nMany Palestinians say they cannot afford to leave while others have pinned hopes on the Doha summit to pressure Israel to scrap its planned offensive.\n\n14,000 buildings, shelters destroyed in a month\n\nHamas said that Israeli forces have destroyed at least 1,600 residential buildings and 13,000 tents since August 11.\n\nIn one of the latest strikes, Israeli forces stormed al-Khader Girls Elementary School in Jerusalem’s Old City and assaulted the mayor, Ahmad Salah, the head of the Parents Council, and a municipality member, Issam Naim, the Wafa news agency reports.\n\nMahmoud Abdullah, head of the Parents Council at al-Khader Unified Schools, said Israeli forces stormed the elementary school as students were leaving.\n\nAbdullah added that soldiers beat him, Salah and Naim with rifle butts and their hands, causing bruises. He added that the troops threatened to “close all seven schools”.\n\nThe school complex has been repeatedly attacked by Israeli forces who target both female and male students.\n\nAt least 64,871 people have been killed and 164,610 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza while millions have been displaced since October 2023.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 15th, 2025",
