By declaring such a nominal purchase amount, the importer appears to have circumvented financial scrutiny, potentially paying the true cost through unofficial or illicit channels as declared value of vehicle had to be paid through remittances originating from foreign countries.”\n\nIn case of failure to substantiate that the actual value of the vehicle was paid through foreign country sources, it can raise concerns with regard to funds transferred through illicit channels involving hawala/hundi — a common hallmark of TBML schemes.\n\nDiscrepancies\n\nThe discrepancies included misclassification of HS Code, misdeclaration of value/non-application of valuation rulings (VRs), violations of SROs involving inadmissible concessions/exemptions, short payment of sales tax on retail price etc.\n\nDuring the post-clearance audit of cancelled GDs, a fiscal fraud phenomenon was detected where assessed/finalised GDs were cancelled and refiled to evade duty/taxes. The modus operandi were such that GDs were filed by misdeclaring descriptions, HS codes, values, etc.\n\nDuring examination/assessment when adverse findings were reported involving evasion of duty/taxes, instead of making payments, the importers requested the cancellation of GDs which was allowed. After a gap of a few days/weeks, the same importer again filed GD with same misdeclarations, but this time GDs were assessed at lower duty/taxes in favour of the importers. In this manner, the importers managed to evade duty/taxes while also avoiding fines.\n\nThe audit also found glaring examples of using vague descriptions, which eve­n­t­ually culminated in lower value asse­ssments. In such cases, at post-clearance stages, it becomes very difficult to detect misdeclaration beca­use primary lapse lies with the dep­artment/assessing officer who asse­ssed goods at a lower value, thus shi­fting the burden of proof to the department to prove any misdeclaration.\n\nIt said 54 solar panel containers belonging to five bogus importers were manifested in the year 2023, but fraudulently cleared through 28 GDs between Dec 2024 and Feb 2025, under different/unauthorised NTNs and Customs User IDs, reflecting exploitation of the FBR’s Registration Module and Customs Computerised System.\n\nEven worse, some of these importers were previously arrested in similar cases and reported themselves as petty employees drawing Rs30,000 in salary. “This forms part of the broader solar panel money laundering scam—already a high-profile case—reflecting a serious systemic lapse”.\n\nThe audit highlighted that the increasing quantum of green channel clearances—now covering nearly 60pc of imports and 85pc of exports—is gradually shrinking the scope of pre-clearance controls.\n\nAdditionally, limiting visibility of GD particulars under the FCA undermined pre-clearance assessment quality. The audit observed that modern customs administrations operated on the principle of “front-end facilitation with back-end control”, maintaining an optimal balance between the two is critical.\n\n“In Pakistan Customs’ case, front-end facilitation without proportionate back-end oversight has created a structural lag in the taxation framework, escalating both revenue and compliance risks,” the audit said, adding that the green channel had itself turned into a risk area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 15th, 2025",
