Haider Ali and Muhammad Jawadullah took two wickets each.\n\nThe batters had set up victory.  Waseem and Sharafu started cautiously but soon took the attack to the opposition with a flurry of boundaries.\n\nSharafu fell for his 51, but Waseem kept up the charge and reached fifty with a six. The captain was run out in the final over.\n\nUAE play Pakistan, who went down to tournament favourites India in a key match, next on Wednesday, with the winner likely to move into the Super Four stage of the eight-nation event.\n\nOman were never in the chase and lost five wickets for 50 runs with captain and opener Jatinder Singh scoring 20 as they slumped to a second straight defeat.\n\nDefending champions India, who won the previous edition played in a 50-overs format, lead the table in Group A with two wins in two matches are nearly through to the next stage.\n\nAlong with regional bragging rights, the competition will serve as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.",
