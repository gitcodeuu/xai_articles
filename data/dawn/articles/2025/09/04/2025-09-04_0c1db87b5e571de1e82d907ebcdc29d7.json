It marked the first time the trio have appeared together in public. At a lavish reception after the parade at the Great Hall of the People, Xi told his guests that humanity must not return to the “law of the jungle”.\n\nEarlier, when Russian President Vladimir Putin walked shoulder to shoulder with Chinese President Xi Jinping, a hot mic caught them discussing organ transplants and the possibility that humans could live to 150 years old.\n\nThe moment was carried on the livestream provided by state broadcaster CCTV.\n\nAs Putin and Xi walked toward the Tiananmen rostrum where they viewed the parade with Kim, Putin’s translator could be heard saying in Chinese: “Biotechnology is continuously developing.”\n\nThe translator added, after an inaudible passage: “Human organs can be continuously transplanted. The longer you live, the younger you become, and (you can) even achieve immortality.”\n\nIn response, Xi, who was off camera, can be heard responding in Chinese: “Some predict that in this century humans may live to 150 years old.”\n\nKim was smiling and looking in the direction of Putin and Xi, but it was not clear if the conversation was being translated for him.\n\nPM Shehbaz’s schedule\n\nOn Wednesday, PM Shehbaz visited Beijing’s Anzhen Hospital, and directed Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to establish simple, robust and sustainable infrastructure at Islamabad’s under-construction hospitals, including Jinnah Medical Complex, to deliver high-quality medical facilities, modelled on Chinese standards.\n\nHe also held a series of high-level meetings with senior executives of China’s leading enterprises in Beijing to boost business-to-business (B2B) investment cooperation between the two countries.\n\nThe prime minister emphasized that industrial cooperation remains the cornerstone of Pakistan-China economic cooperation and a defining pillar of the high-quality development of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as it enters into its second phase.\n\nHe invited Chinese companies to consider Pakistan as their preferred investment destination, particularly for relocating industries into Special Economic Zones.\n\nSyed Irfan Raza in Islamabad also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 4th, 2025",
