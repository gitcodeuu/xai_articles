An inquiry conducted by the public works department earlier pointed out several defects in the elevators.\n\nThe inquiry report noted that the elevators lacked certain features promised in the prototype and the specifications, but it failed to identify those responsible for the fau­lty installation and maintenance.\n\nApart from the elevators, the IHC building continues to suffer from multiple problems, including an ineffective cooling system and inadequate parking facilities for litigants and lawyers.\n\nThe judges observed that instead of referring the matter directly to the National Accountability Bureau or the Federal Investigation Agency, the federal government should be asked to carry out a comprehensive probe and take corrective measures.\n\nCJ’s powers\n\nUnlike these two agenda items, the proposed IHC Rules, 2025 triggered a sharp division among the judges. While the chief justice strongly supported them, senior judges, including Justice Kayani, Justice Jahangiri, Justice Sattar, Justice Sardar Ejaz, and Justice Imtiaz, opposed their adoption and urged amendments.\n\nA day before the meeting, Justice Sattar and Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan had written letters to their colleagues, voicing serious concerns that administrative powers were being misused to sideline dissenting judges.\n\nBoth judges strongly objected to a new circular requiring judges to obtain a No-Objection Cert­ificate (NOC) from the chief justice for foreign travel.\n\nThey alleged that case assignments were being manipulated to benefit judges transferred to the IHC alongside the chief justice, while permanent judges who had opposed his transfer were being sidelined.\n\nThe letters also challenged the chief justice’s use of the “master of the roster” power to transfer part-heard cases.\n\nJustice Khan also took exception to the new Practice and Procedure Rules (PPR), reminding his colleagues that PPR had already been gazetted without approval or even proper discussion by the full bench.\n\nHe noted the voluminous document, spanning more than 600 pages, had been provided only a day and a half before the meeting, reducing consultation to a mere formality and making meaningful input impossible.\n\nJustice Khan dem­anded that five additional agenda items, including these objections, be formally taken up for “proper deliberations” in the full court meeting, signalling his refusal to let the controversy be ignored.\n\nVoting and objections\n\nAccording to sources, Chief Justice Dogar rejected any alteration in the agenda and proceeded to call a vote.\n\nSix judges, including the chief justice, approved the rules, while five opposed them and resolved to record their objections in writing.\n\nDuring the proceedings, the dissenting judges questioned whether those voting in favour had even read the new rules. The response, sources claimed, was negative.\n\nSome judges, noting the massive length of the document, requested the chief justice to postpone the meeting, but their plea was turned down. Ultimately, the High Court Establishment (Appointment and Con­ditions of Service) Rules, 2025 were adopted by a razor-thin majority, leaving the full court deeply divided.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 4th, 2025",
