  "content": "HARARE: Pathum Nissanka top-scored with a swift 55 as Sri Lanka beat Zimbabwe by four wickets in Harare in the first of three Twenty20 Internationals on Wednesday.\n\nZimbabwe posted 175-7 in 20 overs, thanks mainly to 81 runs from opener Brian Bennett, and Sri Lanka reached 177-6 with five balls to spare. The teams meet again on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nAfter 27-year-old right-hand bat Nissanka played a pivotal role with a half century and a century in a 2-0 One-day International series victory, he proved equally successful in the shorter format.\n\nHis 15th T20 half-century came off 32 balls and included four fours and two sixes before a top edge off the bowling of Tinotenda Maposa was caught by wicket-keeper Tadiwanashe Marumani. His exit triggered a mini-collapse as four Sri Lankan wickets fell in 19 balls with the tourists adding just 10 runs to reach 106-4.\n\nBut an unbeaten 41 from Kamindu Mendis off 16 balls, including four sixes, steadied the tourists’ innings. His main support came from Dushan Hemantha (14 not out).\n\nQuick Richard Ngarava, with 2-19 in four overs, was the pick of the Zimbabwe bowlers at Harare Sports Club.\n\nBennett fell 10 runs short of his best T20 score as he notched a fifth T20 half century.\n\nAttempting a scoop shot, Bennett was the victim of a yorker from quick Dushmantha Chameera (3-30) that uprooted the middle stump.\n\nThe only other Zimbabwe batter to pass the 20-run mark was captain Sikandar Raza, who made 28 before being caught by Nissanka at deep midwicket off the bowling of Hemantha.\n\nScoreboard\n\nZIMBABWE:\n\nB.
