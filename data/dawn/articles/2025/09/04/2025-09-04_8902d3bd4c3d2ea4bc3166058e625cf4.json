Also, the LG teams will assess damages and calculate rehabilitation independently as a third party verification.\n\nThe damage assessment reports submitted by the relevant departments were scrutinised thrice between August 19 and 25.\n\nThe assessment carried by the line departments put the cost of rehabilitation of 538 damaged development schemes at over Rs12.2 billion with the communication and works department claiming the major chunk of losses worth over Rs7 billion. The irrigation department came up with the figure of Rs4.7 billion and the public health engineering department with Rs442 million.\n\nThe documents noted that LG department through its field formations “re-verified” the estimated costs of rehabilitation.\n\nThey showed that teams were constituted comprising the secretary of the village and neighborhood council, sub-engineer, patwari halqa, assistant engineer, assistant director and senior official of district administration. Also, elected representatives and secretaries of every village and neighbourhood council also independently reported whether or not their area was affected.\n\nThe documents revealed that the teams later visited every affected project site and took feedback from the community as well, while the damage was assessed on a predefined proforma.Teams of the director general (monitoring and evaluation) at the planning and development department were asked to help “cross-verify” LG teams’ working.\n\nThe documents said that the re-verification showed that the schemes damaged before Aug 15 were also included for rehabilitation. In addition, on several occasions, geo-tags were found missing and the schemes slated as damaged were duplicated.\n\nThe LG department’s exercise showed that out of 1,053 village and neighbourhood councils in eight districts of Malakand division, just 273 were affected by the Aug 15 rains and floods.\n\nThe final damage assessment report revealed that a total of 923 development schemes were damaged in 273 village and neighbourhood councils of the Malakand Division, including 238 roads, 109 bridges, 87 drinking water supply schemes, 91 irrigation channels, 212 retaining walls, 154 sanitation schemes and 32 public buildings. The exercise put the cost of the rehabilitation of the damaged facilities at Rs5.7 billion compared instead of the initial Rs12.2 billion, according to documents.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 4th, 2025",
