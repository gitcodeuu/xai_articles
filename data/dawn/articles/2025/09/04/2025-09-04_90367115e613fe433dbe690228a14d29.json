The CJCSC was presented with a guard of honour at the Qatar Armed Forces Headquarters ahead of the meeting.\n\nAs per ISPR, CJCSC “highlighted historic brotherly ties between both nations”, discussing the “future dimensions of cooperation in defence and security domains between the two countries within the ambit of the Higher Military Cooperation Committee.”\n\nThe Qatari military leadership lauded the sacrifices the Pakistan armed forces have made in the country’s fight against terrorism, ISPR said.\n\nPakistan and Qatar share strong bilateral ties across multiple sectors. In 2024, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the Gulf country, where both nations agreed to deepen cooperation and explore new horizons to strengthen bilateral ties. In October last year, Qatar pledged to invest $3 billion in multiple sectors in Pakistan.\n\nIn October 2023, the then Chief of Staff of Qatar’s armed forces, Lieutenant General Salem Hamad Eqail Al-Nabet, had called on Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal General Asim Munir, and appreciated Pakistan Army’s continuous efforts for peace and stability in the region.",
