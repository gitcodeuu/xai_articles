The highest bids for both the blue sheep and Himalayan ibex permits were won by M Ali Nagri of Markhor Safaris.\n\nFor the upcoming season, the department raised the base price for an Astore markhor permit to $200,000, up from $150,000 last year.\n\nThe base prices for blue sheep and Himalayan ibex were set at $30,000 and $10,000, up from $9,000 and $5,500, respectively. In the 2024-25 season, the highest bid for a markhor was $161,000.\n\nHowever, some local outfitters and tour operators argued the sharp fee hikes are discouraging international clients and could harm their businesses.\n\n“If the true spirit of conservation is replaced with short-term financial gains for local communities, the model will lose its foundation and is likely to collapse within a few years, leaving both wildlife and communities at a greater loss,” said Ikram Baig, president of the GB Association of Tour Operators.\n\nThe trophy hunting programme in Gilgit-Baltistan was launched in 1990 and is credited with helping protect endangered species.\n\nUnder the programme, local communities receive about 80 percent of the revenue from hunting permits to be used for conservation and development projects. Stakeholders now fear the latest price hikes could jeopardise its sustainability.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 4th, 2025",
