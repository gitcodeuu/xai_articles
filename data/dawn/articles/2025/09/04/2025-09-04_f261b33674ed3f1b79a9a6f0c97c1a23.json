Smotrich has also called for annexing the West Bank.\n\n“From the very beginning, we viewed the Accords as a way to enable our continued support for the Palestinian people and their legitimate aspiration for an independent state,” United Arab Emira­tes’s Assistant Minister for Political Affairs and Envoy of the Minister of Foreign Affairs Lana Nusseibeh told Reuters. “We call on the Israeli government to suspend these [settlement] plans.”\n\nMs Nusseibeh added that annexation “would constitute a red line for the United Arab Emirates,” as it would undermine the “vision and spirit” of the accords and end the pursuit of regional integration.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. However, on Wednesday, Smotrich said maps were being drawn up for annexing territory, though it was unclear if he had Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s support.\n\nGaza offensive\n\nThe diplomatic friction comes as the Israeli military pushed deeper into Gaza City, with soldiers and tanks entering Sheikh Radwan, one of the urban center’s most crowded neighbourhoods.\n\nResidents said the military destroyed homes and tent encampments that housed Palestinians displaced by the war.\n\nAccording to local health officials, at least 24 Palestinians, including children, were killed across Gaza, most of them in Gaza City, on Wednesday.\n\n“Sheikh Radwan is being burnt upside-down.\n\nThe occupation destroyed houses, burnt tents, and drones played audio messages ordering people to leave the area,” said Zakeya Sami, 60.\n\n“If the takeover of Gaza City isn’t stopped, we might die, and we are not going to forgive anyone who stands and watches,” she told Reuters.\n\nWitnesses said the military also dropped grenades on three schools in the Sheikh Radwan area sheltering displaced families and bombed a medical clinic, destroying two ambulances.\n\nNetanyahu has ordered the military to take the city, which he describes as the last stronghold of Hamas.\n\nIn Israel, public sentiment has increasingly favoured ending the war in a deal to release the remaining prisoners.\n\nIn Jerusalem on Wednesday, protesters climbed the roof of Israel’s national library, displaying a banner that read, “You have abandoned and also killed.”\n\nChildren disabled\n\nThe war’s devastating toll on civilians was highlighted in a United Nations report Wednesday, which found that at least 21,000 children in Gaza have been disabled since the conflict began.\n\nThe UN Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities said that of the 40,500 children who have suffered new war-related injuries, more than half have been left disabled.\n\nThe committee reported that Israeli evacuation orders were “often inaccessible” to people with hearing or visual impairments. Committee member Muhannad Al-Azzeh cited the example of a deaf mother in Rafah killed with her children, unaware of evacuation instructions.\n\nRestrictions on humanitarian aid have disproportionately affected people with disabilities, who face severe disruptions to assistance, leaving many without food, water, or sanitation.\n\nThe committee noted that 83 per cent of disabled people have lost assistive devices like wheelchairs and walkers, which Israeli authorities often consider “dual-use items” and exclude from aid shipments.\n\n“We can’t expect children with disabilities… to be able to run and go to the (aid) points,” Mr Azzeh said. “This is why one of our main recommendations is that children with disabilities must be reached out to.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 4th, 2025",
