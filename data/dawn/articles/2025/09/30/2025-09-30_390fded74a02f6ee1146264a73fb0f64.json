He expressed satisfaction with all those steps,” he said.\n\nMr Saif said the PTI founder called the chief minister’s adviser on finance, Muzammil Aslam, for a detailed briefing on economic matters and the next budget, and issued instructions to approach the court against the denial of a meeting with him.\n\nHe said that the two leaders also discussed the performance of provincial ministers and various departments.\n\n“Mr Imran gave full authority to the chief minister for necessary measures,” he said.\n\nMr Saif said that the PTI founder issued directions to the chief minister to take necessary measures for accelerating the ongoing movement for the supremacy of the law and real freedom in the country.\n\nHe added that Mr Imran and Mr Gandapur discussed differences in the party, with the former ordering strict action against “those creating issues within the party”.\n\n“Mr Imran Khan made it clear that there is no place in the party for those creating differences, so he issued directions to stop party members from issuing negative statements, which harmed unity in the party,” he said.\n\nThe chief minister’s adviser said that Mr Gandapur would approach the apex court against the “ban” on meetings with the PTI founder in jail.\n\nHe said that voters in KP gave the PTI the mandate to rule them, so it was extremely important to regularly hold consultative meetings with Mr Imran on governance.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
