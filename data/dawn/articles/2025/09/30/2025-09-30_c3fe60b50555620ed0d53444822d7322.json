As he put up resistance, the robber opened fire on him and rode away with his accomplice without snatching the cell phone.\n\nShaukat sustained critical bullet wounds and was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival.\n\nThe CCTV footage, which also went viral on social media, showed that the deceased was carrying his infant son while another son was standing near him when the incident occurred.\n\nWest Zone DIG Irfan Ali Baloch ordered the suspension of the SHO concerned for failing to curb incidents of street crime in his jurisdiction.\n\nMeanwhile, a 45-year-old man was shot dead on Sharea Faisal near Nursery on Monday, police said.\n\nTipu Sultan SHO Yasin Gujjar said Mohammed Zada was a labourer and the murder appeared to be an outcome of some personal enmity.\n\nHe said that the victim had left his native town in Dir, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a year ago due to enmity and had been living in Karachi since then.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
