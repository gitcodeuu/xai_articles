He said the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team would oversee prompt execution and quality assurance of all development projects.\n\n“Reducing difficulties of the common man in Balochistan is the government’s top priority,” Mr Bugti said.\n\n“All departments must adopt public service as their mission and play an active and responsible role,” the chief minister said. He said new buses for the Green Bus scheme had already been procured and these were expected to arrive at the Karachi Port in the second week of October.\n\nHe said the Green Bus fleet would be expanded to improve urban mobility, while the Pink Bus Service would be launched to provide safe and dedicated transport for women.\n\nThe chief minister also announced a plan to provide electric bikes to working women on easy instalments.\n\nHe instructed that all proposed schemes for the upcoming fiscal year must secure technical approval by May to ensure timely inclusion in the budget.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
