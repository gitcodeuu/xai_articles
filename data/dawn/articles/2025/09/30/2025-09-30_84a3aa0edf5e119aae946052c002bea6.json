“farce”.\n\nWashington’s European allies urged Hamas to accept the plan, which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he supported as he warned the Palestinian armed group of more devastation if it did not comply.\n\nEight Arab or Muslim-majority nations said in a joint statement that they “welcome the role of the American president and his sincere efforts aimed at ending the war in Gaza”.\n\nThey said they “affirm their readiness to engage positively and constructively with the US and the parties toward finalising the agreement and ensuring its implementation”.\n\nThe countries include Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, which all recognise Israel, although some have turbulent relationships.\n\nAlso signing the statement were Qatar, which has played a key mediatory role, and Saudi Arabia, whose future normalisation with Israel is a key goal for Trump and Netanyahu.\n\nIndonesia and Pakistan, the world’s two most populous Muslim-majority countries, also joined the statement.\n\nIndonesia has offered troops as part of a future Gaza force, while Pakistan has been eager to woo Trump and improve its relationship with Washington.\n\nTrump hailed a statement by Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, posted on X even before the White House announcement, in which he voiced his “firm belief that President Trump is fully prepared to assist in whatever way necessary” to secure an end to the conflict.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority, which Netanyahu has sought to sideline, was also quick to offer support, welcoming Trump’s “sincere and determined efforts”.\n\nHamas has yet to comment in depth, saying the group had yet to receive the plan.\n\nBut Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian armed group fighting alongside Hamas in Gaza, called the plan “a recipe for continued aggression against the Palestinian people”.\n\n“Through this, Israel is attempting, via the United States, to impose what it could not achieve through war,” it said.\n\nResidents of Gaza expressed scepticism over the plan, dismissing it as a trick to release hostages that would not end the war.\n\n“We as a people will not accept this farce,” said Abu Mazen Nassar, 52.\n\nFrance\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron met last week with Trump and said the United States was adopting elements of a French plan, despite disagreement over France’s recognition of a Palestinian state.\n\nMacron hailed Trump’s “commitment to ending the war in Gaza”.\n\n“Hamas has no choice but to immediately free all hostages and follow this plan,” Macron wrote on X.\n\nHe also called on Israel to commit “resolutely” to it.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s office said the UK “strongly” supported Trump’s “efforts to end the fighting, release the hostages and ensure the provision of urgent humanitarian assistance for the people of Gaza”.\n\nThe plan includes a call for a transitional body in Gaza led by Trump and involving former British prime minister Tony Blair.\n\n“President Trump has put down a bold and intelligent plan which, if agreed, can end the war, bring immediate relief to Gaza, the chance of a brighter and better future for its people, whilst ensuring Israel’s absolute and enduring security and the release of all hostages,” Blair said in a statement.\n\nEuropean Union\n\nEuropean Union chief Antonio Costa urged all parties to “seize this moment to give peace a genuine chance”, adding that the “situation in Gaza is intolerable”.\n\nItaly\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s right-wing government, which has faced growing pressure over its cautious stance, also hailed Trump’s diplomacy.\n\nIn a statement, it called on “all sides to seize this opportunity and accept the plan”.\n\nGermany\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul said the Trump plan “offers a unique opportunity to end the terrible conflict in Gaza.\n\n“Finally, there is hope for Israelis and Palestinians that this war could soon be over.”\n\nSpain\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez, who has accused Israel of committing “genocide” in Gaza, said Madrid “welcomes the peace proposal”.\n\n“We have to put an end to so much suffering,” he said, adding that a two-state solution was “the only one possible”.\n\nIndia\n\nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also welcomed Trump’s “announcement of a comprehensive plan to end the Gaza conflict”.\n\n“It provides a viable pathway to long term and sustainable peace, security and development for the Palestinian and Israeli people, as also for the larger West Asian region,” PM Modi posted on X.\n\n“We hope that all concerned will come together behind President Trump’s initiative and support this effort to end conflict and secure peace,” he said.\n\nAustralia\n\nAustralian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has said the country welcomes Trump’s plan “to bring peace to Gaza after almost two years of conflict and a devastating loss of civilian life”.\n\n“Australia has consistently been part of international calls for a ceasefire, return of the hostages, and a flow of aid to Gaza,” PM Albanese said.\n\n“Australia affirms the plan’s commitment to denying Hamas any role in the future governance of Gaza, and calls on Hamas to agree to the plan, lay down its arms and release all remaining hostages,” he said.\n\nRussia The Kremlin has also said it supports US President Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the conflict in Gaza.\n\n“Russia always supports and welcomes any efforts by President Trump aimed at ending this ongoing tragedy,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters, including AFP, on a daily briefing call.\n\n“Of course, we want this plan to be implemented and for it to help bring events in the Middle East to a peaceful conclusion,” he added.\n\nHeader Image: US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu shake hands at the conclusion of a joint press conference in the State
