Rising demand and prices may push farmers to sell seed as grain, cutting availability across provinces.\n\nThe report said flooding cut fodder supplies, raising costs and limiting access in remote areas.\n\nMany livestock owners are resorting to distress sales, and only 45 per cent of fodder seed is available in the formal market, heightening risks for livestock nutrition. Overcro­wded shelters and stagnant water are heightening stress and disease risks for livestock.\n\nThe FAO warned that conditions are favourable for outbreaks of lumpy skin disease (LSD), foot-and-mouth disease, peste des petits ruminants (PPR) and other zoonotic infections. LSD outbreaks have already been reported in southern Punjab bordering Sindh and Balochistan and are spreading northwards, with new cases in Pakp­attan, Lodhran and Khanewal.\n\nQuantifying crop-wise damage in Punjab, the FAO report said: Rice: 188,837 hectares damaged (7.3pc of total rice area), mainly in the northeast. The worst-hit districts were Sialkot (37,944 ha, 24.67pc), Naro­wal (20,008 ha, 15.88pc), Gujranwala (10,765 ha, 4.72pc), Bahawalnagar (9,594 ha, 8.60pc) and She­ikh­upura (9,364 ha, 4.25pc).\n\nCotton: 84,182 hectares damaged (5.1pc of total cotton area). The worst-hit districts were Bahawalpur (19,503 ha, 6.10pc), Raja­npur (8,688 ha, 6.75pc), Khanewal (7,724 ha, 8.21pc), Multan (6,917 ha, 7.57pc) and Muzaffargarh (6,477 ha, 7.03pc).\n\nSugarcane: 23,413 hectares damaged (2.8pc of total sugarcane area). The most affected districts were Faisalabad (2,466 ha, 4.01pc), Jhang (2,254 ha, 4.05pc), Bhakkar (2,201 ha, 6.28pc), Rajanpur (1,512 ha, 2.87pc) and Layyah (1,504 ha, 5.45pc).\n\nIn KP, 62,080 hectares of land were flooded, including 50,821 hectares of cropland (2.7pc of total cropland). In Sindh, 74,542 hectares of land were flooded (0.5pc of total land), including 43,140 hectares of cropland (0.8pc of total cropland).\n\n‘Focus on complaints’\n\nIn the meantime, the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority has ordered survey teams to focus on addressing public complaints while conducting assessment of flood-damaged areas across the province.\n\nIn Jalalpur Pirwala, displaced people were asked to vacate schools being used as relief camps so classes could resume.\n\nPDMA issued water-level data for all rivers in Punjab, showing normal flows and a significant decl­ine in flood-affected areas.\n\nSeparately, the PMD has predicted rain, wind, and thundershowers in south-eastern Sindh till October 2, with occasional gaps.\n\nAamir Yasin in Rawalpindi also contributed to this report.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
