The association declined to give details.\n\nFAM secretary general Noor Azman Rahman said in the statement the FAM “takes the matter very seriously”.\n\n“The FAM, however, would like to emphasise that the heritage players involved are legitimate Malaysian citizens,” he said.\n\nIn a ruling that sparked anger in Malaysia, FIFA also hit the FAM with a fine of 350,000 Swiss francs ($440,000).\n\n“FAM has followed the proper process and cooperated with FIFA and the Malaysian government,” said Tunku Ismail Sultan Ibrahim, owner of the powerful Johor Darul Ta’zim Football Club (JDT).\n\n“FIFA has approved this, so why has the decision changed now? What happened that suddenly led to such a decision?” he told local media on Sunday.\n\nMalaysia’s Communications Minister Fahmi Fadzil said on Monday “as far as the government is concerned, the documents are in order and there is no issue”.\n\nThe controversy broke out after Malaysia’s 4-0 victory over Viet­nam in June in an Asian Cup qualifier.\n\nMalaysia currently top their 2027 Asian Cup qualifying group with six points from two matches, pending any further FIFA sanctions. The FAM “is awaiting the full judgement from FIFA before filing an appeal in accordance with the existing legal process”, it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
