However, the American paraglider was forced to make a crash-landing. She sustained injuries to her leg, though her condition was initially stated to be stable.\n\nSources said she had also suffered broken ribs and an ankle injury and was found unconscious. Using a satellite phone, her fellow paraglider informed a friend about the situation, who then sought urgent rescue assistance from local people. Volunteers from Hop­er Valley reached the incident site on Sunday and managed to rescue the injured paraglider, taking her to some distance.\n\nThe volunteers stayed overnight in camp, providing food and first aid. On Monday morning, a Pakistan Army Aviation helicopter airlifted the injured American paraglider to Gilgit and later to Skardu. From there, she was shifted to Islamabad on a chartered flight the same day.\n\nRush Lake is among the world’s highest alpine lakes, located about 15 km north of Miar Peak and Spantik. Tourists usually trek from Hoper Valley, crossing Hoper Glacier and Miar Glacier, to reach the site.\n\nRakaposhi expedition\n\nMeanwhile, two Ameri­can climbers — Dane Christensen and Craig Orion Lutwyler — have begun an expedition to summit the 7788m Rakaposhi.\n\nAccording to GB tourism department, both climbers have been issued permits. From Rakaposhi base camp, they started their climbing on Monday. They are being assisted by two local high-altitude porters. The American climbers plan to complete the mission in a month.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 30th, 2025",
