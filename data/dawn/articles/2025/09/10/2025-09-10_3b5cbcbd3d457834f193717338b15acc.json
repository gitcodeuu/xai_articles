However, former MNA Rubina Jamil, Afshan Tariq and Rubina Khan were acquitted due to a lack of evidence.\n\nOf the 51 accused, the court acquitted 21, convicted 18 and declared 12 others, including PTI activist Sanam Javed, absconders for failing to appear before the court.\n\nAmong those sentenced to 10 years each were Junaid Ali, Salamat Khan, Najam Shahid, Saud Javed, Muhammad Faisal, Haroon Khan, Ahmed Mursalin, Elahi Bakhsh, Rana Talal Khurshid, Rana Tanvir, Hamza Sohail, Usman Aslam and Farhan Aziz.\n\nThose acquitted inc­l­uded Umair Nazir, Far­man Ali, Umar Bilal, Saa­d­ullah, Muhammad Qas­im, Kashif Ahmad, Hafiz Ihsan, Amber Gul, Kha­l­ilur Rehman, Amir Yasin, Ali Hassan, Muhammad Qasim, Tayyab Ali, Mian Haroon, Bilal Zulfiqar, Yar Khan and Naeem Akhtar.\n\nThe Sarwar Road police had registered the case (FIR No. 109/2023) against PTI leaders and workers for attacking and torching a judge’s squad vehicle near Jinnah House and Rahat Bakery in Lahore Cant­onment. The May 9 riots erupted after the arrest of PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan by the National Accou­n­t­ability Bureau from the Islamabad High Court premises. PTI leaders and workers subsequently att­acked military facilities and public property across the country.\n\nThis is the fourth case in Lahore in which Shah Mahmood Qureshi has been acquitted, while Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omer Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry and Mehmoodur Rashid have been convicted.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 10th, 2025",
