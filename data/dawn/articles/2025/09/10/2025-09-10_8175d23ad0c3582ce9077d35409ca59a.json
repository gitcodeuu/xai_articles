The FIR also stated that some audience members were also making videos and sharing them on social media.\n\nSHO Amin said that personnel from the Zaida and Tehsil Topi police stations, along with other police posts, were called and a raid was conducted.\n\nSenior police officials had said on Sunday that Swabi police arrested a TikToker who was allegedly making videos while dressing as a girl and uploading them to his account to “mislead people, especially the youth“.\n\nLast month, a Lahore magistrate dismissed a case against transgender persons for allegedly organising an “objectionable” private party after police had arrested them earlier.",
