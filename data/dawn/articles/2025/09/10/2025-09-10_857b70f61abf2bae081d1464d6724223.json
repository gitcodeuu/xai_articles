  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and Türkiye have stressed the need to expedite the expansion and implementation of the “Pakistan-Türkiye Trade in Goods Agreement,” aiming to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion.\n\nThe agreement was discussed at the 16th Session of the Pakistan-Türkiye Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC) held in Islamabad on Sept 8-9. The JMC, an institutional mechanism for economic cooperation established in 1975, was co-chaired by Pakistan’s Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan and Türkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yaar Güler.\n\nThe two sides committed to enhancing market access for both countries, with a particular focus on 24 key sectors, including Trade, Investment, Energy, ICT, Banking, Education, Health, and Climate Change. A notable outcome was the agreement to initiate the first round of in-person negotiations for the Trade in Goods Agreement in October 2025.\n\nBoth nations agreed to strengthen business-to-business linkages, facilitate digital trade, and streamline customs cooperation. Regional connectivity was also a key focus, with an accelerated effort to operationalise the Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul (ITI) Railway Corridor and progress on the TURPAK Transport Corridor.\n\nIn the energy sector, both countries agreed to establish Sub-Working Grou­­ps to explore collaboration in renewables, LNG, electric vehicle infrastructure, and hydropower.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 10th, 2025",
