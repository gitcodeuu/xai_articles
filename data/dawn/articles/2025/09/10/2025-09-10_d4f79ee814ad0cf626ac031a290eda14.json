While suggesting expediting the process of registering new drugs, Mr Chishti said Health Minister Mustafa Kamal had told that the decision over withdrawal of price deregulation would be taken after a survey.\n\nIt is worth mentioning here that the caretaker government, just a day before expiry of its tenure, decided to deregulate prices of drugs due to which pharmaceutical companies were able to increase prices on their own. The minister gave the same statement during the previous meeting of the committee held last month.\n\nSenator Dr Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur also highlighted that medicine prices were continuously rising, making them unaffordable for the common people, particularly in the aftermath of the devastating floods.\n\nSuggests rescheduling of MDCAT in wake of floods\n\nShe emphasised the urgent need for measures to ensure access to affordable medicines.\n\nThe ministry officials informed the committee that certain medicines were imported, which contributed to their high cost. The committee was further apprised of the alarming prevalence of counterfeit medicines being sold in the market at high prices.\n\nSenator Amir Waliuddin Chishti directed the ministry to submit a detailed report on medicine pricing in the next meeting.\n\nMustafa Kamal informed the committee members that an online portal had been launched to streamline regulatory procedures regarding import of medical devices. He stated that following its launch, applicants no longer needed to visit Drap office, and 180 cases had already been processed through the portal.\n\nSenator Danesh Kumar raised concerns that nowadays every pregnancy was going through C-section which was not fair with women, adding that doctors were prescribing lots of medicines to patients to get commission and foreign trips.\n\nSenator Irfanul Haque Siddiqui appreciated Senator Danesh Kumar, saying he had raised a very serious issue.\n\nHe suggested that details be sought from each doctor as to how many C-section they had done in their services.\n\nThe committee chairman recommended submitting data of the federal and provincial hospitals regarding the number of C-sections carried out.\n\nOn the request of senators, the committee chairman committee, Senator Amir Waliuddin Chishti, approved setting up of a subcommittee to further probe into the matter.\n\nSenator Fawzia Arshad expressed concern over the rising number of dengue cases in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) and stressed the need for immediate preventive measures, including carrying out fumigation to control the spread of the disease.\n\nSuggestion to delay MDCAT\n\nThe committee considered the concern raised by Senator Mirza Mohammad Afridi regarding MDCAT examination scheduled for October 6.\n\nSenator Afridi emphasised that due to the devastating floods in several parts of the country, it would be extremely difficult for students from affected and underprivileged areas to appear in the test.\n\nHe urged that the examination be delayed till November to provide equal opportunity for all candidates, particularly those belonging to poor and flood-hit families.\n\nThe PMDC president informed the committee that a meeting with the test-conducting body was scheduled for today (Wednesday) to review the matter.\n\nHe said 138,000 candidates had registered themselves for MDCAT, adding that all aspects would be taken into account and the committee would be apprised of the final decision accordingly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 10th, 2025",
