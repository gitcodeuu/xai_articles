As a goodwill gesture, the government delegation annou­nced the release of all political activists and the withdrawal of cases registered in various districts of Balochistan, on the directives of Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti.\n\nIt was agreed that opposition parties would coordinate with district administrations to organise rallies and public gatherings in line with standard operating procedures (SOPs).\n\nOpposition leaders assu­red that all demonstrations would remain peaceful, laws would be fully respected and public property protected. They further pled­g­­ed that no violent incidents or destructive actions would take place during protests.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 10th, 2025",
