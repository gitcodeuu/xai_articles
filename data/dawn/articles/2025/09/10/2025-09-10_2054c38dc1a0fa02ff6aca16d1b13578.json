Officials said a large number of Chinese nationals protested and exchanged hot words with officials.\n\nThe GB people and traders have been staging a protest sit-in and blocking the Karakoram Highway for the last 51 days against collection of Sales Tax, Income Tax and Excise Tax by the federal government from the GB people. They say that collection of any tax from the GB people by the federal government is illegal as they have no representation in Pakistan’s parliament and they are not part of Pakistan according to Constitution of Pakistan.\n\nProtesters block KKH at Sost till acceptance of their demands, suspending travel between Pakistan and China through Khunjerab Pass\n\nGB Assembly member from treasury bench advocate Amjad Hussain, who is also PPP president of GB chapter, told GB Assembly that talks with the federal government are under way to settle the issue.\n\nAdvocate Amjad Hussain is also the member of a committee formed by the GB chief minister to hold talks with the federal government committee to resolve the issue.\n\nIn first meeting between representatives of the GB committee and the federal government committee, the federal government had admitted that collection of Sales Tax, Income Tax and Excise Tax from GB people and traders is illegal.\n\nAdvocate Amjad Hussain told the GB Assembly the issue will be resolved soon.\n\nOpposition members of GB Assembly Javed Ali Manwa, Raja Zakaria and Syed Sohail Abbas criticised the GB government and federal government for prolonging the issue and not resolving it immediately.\n\nProtesters at the sit-in said that instead of solving the genuine issues, the GB government is planning to start a crackdown against them and warned the government to be ready for dire consequences if it tried to crack down against the protesters.\n\nThe protest sit-in on the KKH is being staged on the call of all traders’ bodies of Gilgit-Baltistan. Gulsher Khan, one of the protest sit-in organisers, said the federal and GB governments are not serious in resolving the issue.\n\nHe said protesters have been demanding their rights under the Constitution of Pakistan and laws. He said Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) could not collect federal taxes from GB people and its traders as the people of the region have no representation in Pakistan’s parliament and therefore the federal government could not collect taxes from the people of the region.\n\nHe said over 200 consignments imported from China have been stuck up at the Sost Dry Port for the last 10 months and because of this, traders of GB have been facing losses of billions of rupees.\n\nAnother organiser of the protest, Ebad Nagari, said that policies of FBR have made thousands of GB people jobless.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 10th, 2025",
