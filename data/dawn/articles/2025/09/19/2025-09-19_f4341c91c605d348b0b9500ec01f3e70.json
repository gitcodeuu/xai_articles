The wounded later succumbed to their injuries, raising the death toll to six.\n\n“The explosion took place near makeshift shops,” Assistant Commissioner Chaman Imtiaz Baloch told Dawn. Police and Levies forces rushed to the scene and shifted the dead and injured to the district hospital.\n\n“The blast left bodies mangled and body parts scattered,” eyewitness Asghar Achakzai, a local reporter, told Dawn by phone.\n\nPolice said initial investigations suggested explosives had been planted outside the shops at the taxi stand.\n\nThe Balochistan Home Depart­ment confirmed the casualties and ordered an inquiry into the incident.\n\nIt asked citizens to cooperate with investigation officials, stressing that the culprits would be brought to justice.\n\nKech suicide attack\n\nMeanwhile, a convoy travelling from Gwadar to Turbat came under attack in the Dasht-i-Kuddan area of Kech district, around 60 kilometres from Turbat.\n\nOfficials said gunmen opened fire on the convoy before a suicide bomber rammed an explosive-laden pickup into one of the buses.\n\nThere was no official word from the local administration or Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) about the incident. It was not immediately clear whether anyone had been killed or injured.\n\nThe banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nKhuzdar operation\n\nSeparately, the military’s media wing said on Thursday that security forces killed four militants linked to the “Indian proxy” group Fitna al-Hindustan during an intelligence-based operation in Khuzdar.\n\n“During the conduct of operation, own forces effectively engaged the terrorists’ location, and after an intense fire exchange, five Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell,” the ISPR said in a statement. Weapons, ammunition and explosives were recovered from the site, it added.\n\n“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and reaffirm the nation’s unwavering resolve to bring the perpetrators of terrorism to justice,” the ISPR said.\n\nThursday’s attacks come amid a surge in militant activity across Balochistan.\n\nEarlier this week, five militants were killed in Khuzdar. Last week, four militants were also killed during an IBO in Mastung, according to ISPR.\n\nA day earlier, two police stations and a Levies post were targeted in Sherani district, leaving one poli­ce­­man martyred and two Levies personnel injured.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 19th, 2025",
