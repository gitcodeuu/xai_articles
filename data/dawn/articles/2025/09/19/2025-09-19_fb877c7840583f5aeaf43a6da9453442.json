The left-arm pacer was adjudicated POTM for his heroics with the bat and his contribution with the ball in what became a comprehensive victory for the Green Shirts.\n\nMatch analysis by Abyan Amir:\n\nShaheen reminded us of his father-in-law yet again with another terrific Afridi cameo that helped salvage the dithering Pakistani batting innings to reach 146-8 — and that was too much for the UAE batters from the get-go.\n\nAfter all the drama in the lead-up to the match, Pakistan ended with a comprehensive victory in a match they were expected to win with ease and will now face India again with a chance at redemption in the aftermath of the controversy over the Men in Blue’s “disappointing” conduct in last Sunday’s encounter.\n\nFakhar Zaman reached his 50 off just 35 deliveries and got out trying to up the rate. The Mardan-born player was the Green Shirts’ sole batter who was dominating the UAE bowlers till Shaheen showed up.\n\nThe Pakistani batters made for another sorry showing as the home bowlers kept them in check throughout — barring Fakhar and Shaheen.\n\nLeft-arm spinner Simranjeet Singh was the pick of the bowlers for the UAE as he ended with figures of 3-26 and kept the home team in the match going into the second innings.\n\nAnd that’s all for today, folks — after all the drama in the lead-up to the match, Pakistan ended with a comprehensive victory in a match they were expected to win with ease.\n\nThe Green Shirts made short work of the UAE lower order after controlling the the last 6 overs of the match with ease.\n\nDawn’s Umaid Wasim says Pakistan are now in a strong position to win, and the newsroom agrees completely with him.\n\nAbrar and Salman struck consecutively to completely take the wind out of the home team’s sails.\n\nUAE have stretched this match into the very final quarter of the match, and kudos to them for pushing Pakistan this far.\n\nUAE rebuild after Pakistan pegged them back at the end of the powerplay, the Green Shirts need to make a breakthrough soon to keep the home batters from getting into a strong position to win!\n\nPakistan have struck after the UAE got a decent start in the first two overs!\n\n2.3: Off stump goes for a walk! Shaheen made a mockery of Alishan Sharafu’s stumps with a jaffa to send the UAE batter packing.\n\nPakistan are in a dominant position now after getting the home side three down in the powerplay.\n\nMid-Match summary by Abyan Amir:\n\nShaheen Afridi reminds us of his father-in-law again! Another terrific Afridi cameo to end the innings as he helped salvage the dithering innings to reach 146-8 at the end of 20 overs thanks to his big hitting towards the end.\n\nFakhar Zaman reached his 50 off just 35 deliveries and got out trying to up the rate. The man was the Green Shirts’ sole batter who was dominating the UAE bowlers till Shaheen showed up.\n\nThe Pakistani batters made for another sorry showing as the home bowlers kept them in check throughout — barring Fakhar and Shaheen.\n\nSimranjeet Singh was the pick of the bowlers for the UAE as he ended with figures of 3-26 and kept the home team in the match going into the second innings.\n\nKhushdil departs after a nothing shot — tries to go for an aerial shot but barely manages to reach the fielder in the deep – on the side with the longer boundary!\n\nCheers of joy go around the newsroom as Pakistan cross the 127 mark! The Green Shirts have crossed their total from the India match.\n\n19.1: Shaheen launches Rohid for a huge straight six down the ground!\n\n19.2: back to back sixes! Shaheen helicopter’s that ball over the square leg boundary for an 80m six!\n\nRohid’s had a terrible day with the ball.\n\nShaheen was reminding us of his father-in-law again! Another terrific Afridi cameo to end the innings as Pakistan salvages the dithering innings to reach 146-9 at the end of 20 overs thanks to Shaheen’s late fireworks.\n\n12.3: Fakhar smacks Parashar for a huge six straight down the ground — the Man from Mardan is on a mission!\n\nFakhar reached his 50 off just 35 deliveries and got out trying to up the rate. The man was the Green Shirts’ sole batter who was dominating the UAE bowlers.\n\nKhushdil Shah is the next batter in for Pakistan. The left-handed batter is known for his big hitting down the order.\n\nSimranjeet Singh gets Hasan Nawaz next as the Green Team sinks further.\n\nFakhar has now taken charge after the Green Shirts lost early wickets.\n\nPakistan start their innings with openers Saim Ayub and Sahibzada Farhan out in the middle.\n\nThe Green Shirts have lost their first wicket in the very first over as Saim continues to have a poor tournament.\n\nSahibazada is the next to fall as Pakistan’s woes with their opening batting continue.\n\nThe Pakistan and UAE Anthems are played as this much-delayed and pivotal encounter finally gets underway.\n\nPakistan will be through to the super-4s and will face India on Sunday if they win today, which is an expected result.\n\nPakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking at the toss, said: “For us, we want to play a proper game today, we didn’t play well in the middle overs in the last game — It’s a great day to play a perfect game.”\n\nPakistan had two changes in their team, Haris Rauf and Khushdil Shah were in for Faheem Ashraf and Sufyan Muqeem.\n\nTeams:\n\nPakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Mohammad Haris (wicket-keeper), Fakhar Zaman, Salman Agha (captain), Khushdil Shah, Hasan Nawaz, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Abrar Ahmed.\n\nUAE: Alishan Sharafu, Muhammad Waseem (capt), Asif Khan, Muhammad Zohaib, Harshit Kaushik, Rahul Chopra (wk), Dhruv Parashar, Haider Ali, Muhammad Rohid Khan, Simranjeet Singh, and Junaid Siddique.",
