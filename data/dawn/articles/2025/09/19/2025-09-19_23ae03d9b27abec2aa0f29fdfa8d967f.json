  "content": "US President Donald Trump and China’s leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone Friday with expectations that they were set to finalise the fate of the hugely popular and influential video app TikTok, as well as discussing trade.\n\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV and the Xinhua news agency said the call had started.\n\nTrump previewed his talks on Thursday, telling Fox News that they would be discussing “TikTok and also trade”.\n\n“And we’re very close to deals on all of it. And my relationship with China is very good,” he said.\n\nThe call was their second since Trump began his second term in January.\n\nOn June 5, the US president said Xi had invited him to visit China, and he issued a similar invitation for the Chinese leader to come to the United States.\n\nSo far, no travel plans have been made, but several analysts expected Xi to repeat his offer Friday, playing on Trump’s enthusiasm for lavish receptions in foreign capitals.\n\n“Each leader will aim to signal that he has outmaneuvered the other” in trade talks focused on tariffs, Ali Wyne, an expert on US-China relations at the International Crisis Group, predicted in a note.\n\nThe pair could settle the TikTok drama, after Trump repeatedly put off a ban under a US law designed to force Chinese parent company ByteDance to sell its US operations for national security reasons.\n\nTrump told reporters on Thursday that he hoped to “finalise something on TikTok”.\n\nUnder the deal, TikTok’s US business would be “owned by all American investors, and very rich people and companies,” Trump said.\n\nHe said he believes TikTok had boosted his appeal to younger voters and helped him win the 2024 election.\n\nThe president on Tuesday again pushed back applying a ban on the app, which had been decided under his predecessor president Joe Biden.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal raised the possibility of a consortium to control TikTok that would include tech giant Oracle and two California investment funds — Silver Lake and Andreessen Horowitz.\n\nThe telephone talks come as the world’s two biggest economies seek to find a compromise on tariffs.\n\nBoth sides dramatically hiked tariffs against each other during a months-long dispute earlier this year, disrupting global supply chains.\n\nWashington and Beijing then reached a deal to reduce levies, which expires in November, with the United States imposing 30 percent duties on imports of Chinese goods and China hitting US products with a 10 percent tariff.\n\nThe phone meeting also comes after Xi organised a major summit this month with the leaders of Russia and India — and invited North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to observe a major military parade in Beijing.\n\n“Please give my warmest regards to (Russian President) Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong Un as you conspire against the United States of America,” Trump wrote to Xi on his Truth Social platform.\n\nThe US leader slammed India with punitive tariffs for its oil purchases from Moscow, and has called on European countries to sanction China for buying Russian oil, though Washington has not itself sanctioned Beijing.\n\n“If they did that on China, I think the war (in Ukraine) would maybe end,” Trump told Fox News.",
