The case against Rana is based upon a complaint of an FBR official, who alleged that the journalist’s report was defamatory and scandalous.\n\nHowever, the meeting reviewed the report and noted that not only was the information available in the official record, the report had proven to be true based on factual evidence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 13th, 2025",
