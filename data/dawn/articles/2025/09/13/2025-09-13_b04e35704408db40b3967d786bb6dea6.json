However, the shop owner detected the presence of explicit content on the drive and informed area residents, who apprehended the suspect and beat him up before handing him over to the police.\n\nOn Friday, the investigating officer of the case produced the suspect before a judicial magistrate (South) and sought his physical custody for further interrogation.\n\nSuspect initially booked in four FIRs for sexual assault on five children\n\nHe stated that the suspect was initially booked in four FIRs regarding rape of four girls and one boy. He added that Section 22 of the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, pertaining to child pornography, had been added to the case after police seized his mobile phone and a USB containing over a hundred explicit videos.\n\nThe IO requested the court to grant police custody of the suspect for further interrogation and for conducting the medical examination of both the suspect and the survivors.\n\nAfter hearing the IO and examining the remand paper, the court remanded the suspect in police custody for five days and directed the IO to submit a progress report at the next hearing.\n\nAccording to the prosecution, the suspect told investigators that he had moved from Abbottabad to Karachi in 2011. In 2016, he shifted to the Qayyumabad area, and started luring and trapping children around 2019.
