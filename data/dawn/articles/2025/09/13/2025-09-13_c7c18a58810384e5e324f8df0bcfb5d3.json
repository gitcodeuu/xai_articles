He says that the increasing frequency of flood disasters has significantly impacted community health and wellbeing in Punjab.\n\n“Its consequences can be felt immediately, in the form of fatalities caused by injuries, or later, due to the localised spread of infectious diseases.”\n\nMr Sheikh says that the flood followed by massive monsoon spells has started taking heavy toll on Punjab.\n\nThough, the health authorities were finding it too hard to collect true impact of diseases due to the prevailing challenging situations, the number of the affected people may reach beyond the expectations, he warns.\n\nHe expresses fears that Punjab may witness the rapid spread of the other diseases, including polio, measles, leishmaniasis, HIV, and Covid-19, which are easily preventable by vaccination.\n\n“These figures will undoubtedly rise further due to the disruption in vaccination campaigns,” Mr Sheikh says, adding that the epidemics and outbreaks are most common affecting a larger population.\n\nPeople may face various problems amidst floods like infectious diseases, reproductive health, and even mental health issues.\n\nDr Masood Sheikh says that a large number of flood victims are currently afflicted with skin and waterborne infections, including but not limited to diarrhea, a typical outbreak in floods.“The reasons for these common skin infections in such areas are the humidity and prolonged contact with contaminated water.”\n\nHe explains that the flooded areas act as the major source of mosquito breeding, as well as the lack of protection against mosquitoes and other insects leads to mosquito-related illness.\n\n“As per the reports emerging from various parts of Punjab, there is an alarming rise of gastroenteritis cases in addition to cholera in certain flood affected areas. The battle against other illnesses such as dengue fever, polio and Covid-19 is also getting worse, especially in camps and places where there is a lack of clean water supply and sanitation while infrastructure is destroyed.”\n\nHe adds that following the flooding, there is a significant increase in the number of trauma cases in most parts of Punjab.\n\nAccording to Dr Sheikh, women and children may be the most vulnerable victims of the floods while the pregnant women flood victims are significantly under threat of hepatitis (A and E) and nutritional deficiencies.Menstruating and pregnant women are in a dire situation since they have no access to menstruation supplies or a hygienic washroom.\n\n“The pregnant women in flood-affected areas are likely to give birth within the next month need maternal health services.In addition to those giving birth to babies, the Punjab health authorities are struggling hard to ensure the access of such women to clinics and hospitals due to the massive damage done to the roadways and communication systems.”\n\nDr Masood Sheikh says that mitigating the spread of diarrheal diseases after floods requires a multi-pronged approach, including promoting hand hygiene by providing access to soap and water or hand-sanitizer, can make it easier for people to practise good hand-hygiene.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 13th, 2025",
