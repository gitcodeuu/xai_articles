A decision was taken to shift police stations from green belts, rented buildings, out-of-jurisdiction areas, and shared facilities.\n\nIslamabad police seek more land for another five police stations\n\nIn response, the CDA sought time from the interior ministry after being directed to allocate suitable plots for police stations within days.\n\nThe police requested that the land be allotted within their respective jurisdictions, in easily accessible locations along main roads. They emphasised that police movement and the mobility of police vehicles should be unhindered.\n\nSeparate police teams were formed to survey the city and identify suitable land for police stations. On the recommendations of these teams, sites were proposed to the CDA for allocation.\n\nAccording to police sources, the buildings of Koral, Kirpa, Khanna, Humak and Banigala police stations are located on green belts. Shamas Colony police station operates from a rented building, while Phulgran police station functions from within the Barakahu police station.\n\nNilore and Lohibher police stations are housed in old choki buildings, while Sangjani station is operating under makeshift arrangements along the N-5.\n\nSo far, the CDA has allotted land for Phulgran, Sangjani, Banigala, Shams Colony and Nilore police stations. Land for Phulgran has been allocated at Green Enclave-I, Sangjani at N-5, Banigala at Margalla Enclave, Shams Colony at I-12 Markaz, and Nilore at Lethrar Road.\n\nPolice teams also surveyed sites for Khanna, Kirpa, Koral, Humak and Lohibher police stations, later proposing land to the CDA. They requested land for Khanna at Rehman Enclave, Kirpa at Gulberg Residencies, Koral at Gulberg Green and Lohibher at Capital Enclave.\n\nThe CDA will construct the new police stations for the capital police.\n\nThe authority has also invited electronic bids for the construction of Humak, Lohibher, Kirpa, Nilore, Koral, Shams Colony, Sangjani and Phulgran police stations. A sum of Rs95.196 million has been reserved for the construction of each station.\n\nMeanwhile, construction of the Golra and Women’s police stations is already underway. The Golra station is being built within the premises of the existing facility, while the Women police station is being constructed in G-7 Markaz, near the old building.\n\nRenovation work has also begun at Aabpara, Margalla, Tarnol, Shalimar, Sumbal, Kohsar, Karachi Company, Ramna, Secretariat, Noon, Sabzi Mandi, Sihala, Barakahu and Shahzad Town police stations.\n\nAIG Logistics, SSP Law and Order, SSP Operations, SP City, SP Dolphin and Patrolling, SP Saddar, SP Security and Discipline, SP I Area, SP Soan and SP Rural have been appointed to monitor the quality and progress of both the renovation and construction work.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 20th, 2025",
