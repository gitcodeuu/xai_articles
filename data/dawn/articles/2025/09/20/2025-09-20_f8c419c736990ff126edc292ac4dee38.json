He added that untimely responses from PTCL management partly caused delays.\n\nCommittee Chairperson Senator Palwasha Khan raised concerns about appointments to the boards of PTCL and its subsidiary Ufone, noting that while PTCL board details were available online, Ufone’s board composition was missing from its website. She said the names had also not been shared in previous meetings.\n\nSenator Kamran Murtaza questioned the perks and privileges enjoyed by board members, including reports of $5,000 allowances and foreign trips. “This is public information and should be disclosed,” Senator Khan remarked.\n\nStolen data\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Afnan Ullah revealed that stolen data worth over Rs65bn is being sold on the dark web, including the personal information of nearly 300,000 Haj applicants.\n\nHe warned of external pressure on Pakistan not to legislate data protection laws and urged urgent action to avoid serious consequences.\n\nPakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Chairman confirmed that SIM data, including his own, had been circulating on the dark web since 2022. He also acknowledged poor telecom service in Balochistan and widespread call drop issues.\n\nSenators criticised IT Minister Shaza Fatima for her repeated absence from committee proceedings, questioning the ministry’s commitment to addressing sectoral issues.\n\nCommittee flags delays, lapses in telecom sector oversight\n\nSenator Nadeem Bhutto highlighted the lack of mobile signals in several areas, including the Karachi–Sukkur Motorway.The PTA informed the committee that it was prepared to proceed with a 5G auction in December, with consultant reports completed. However, pending court cases could delay the process.
