The panel also sought a subsidy package, including a $50 reduction in costs, on the pattern of Haj facilities.\n\nOn air travel, the committee recommended consultations with Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other authorities to initiate direct flights from Karachi to Najaf.\n\nIt further proposed the establishment of permanent facilitation desks at major airports and the restoration of Pakistan Houses in Makkah and Madinah to ensure dignified accommodation for pilgrims.\n\nThe committee stressed that contracts for pilgrim services should be awarded to multiple reputed companies through a transparent process to improve competition and efficiency.\n\nMembers also expressed dissatisfaction with the arrangements for the annual official delegation to Roza-i-Rasool (PBUH), urging that the delegation be treated as state guests and the standard operating procedures (SOPs) be reviewed.\n\nA subcommittee headed by Ms Jumani was formed to draft recommendations.\n\nThe panel also took up the National Commission for Minorities Rights Bill, 2025, moved by Naveed Amir Jeeva.\n\nWhile deliberating on the arrangements for the annual visit of the official high-level delegation to pay homage at Roza-i-Rasool (PBUH), the committee again expressed dissatisfaction with the current arrangements. Members emphasised the importance of ensuring the delegation’s timely departure and presence at Roza-i-Rasool on 12th Rabiul-Awwal every year, in view of the sanctity and significance of the occasion.\n\nThe committee further recommended that the delegation be accorded the status of state guests to uphold the dignity and honour of Pakistan during the sacred visit. In this regard, the committee urged the ministry to hold consultations with its counterpart authorities in the Saudi Arabia (KSA) and to pursue the matter of extending an official invitation from the Saudi government.\n\nTo strengthen the institutional framework and eliminate loopholes in the system, the committee recommended a comprehensive review of the existing SOPs related to the annual delegation visit.\n\nFor this purpose, the committee constituted a subcommittee tasked with revisiting the SOPs and submitting detailed recommendations for further consideration and appropriate action by the standing committee. The sub-committee will comprise Shagufta Jumani, Asiya Naz Tanoli, Samina Khalid Ghurki, and Syed Sami Ullah.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Pir Syed Fazal Ali Shah Jilani, Seema Mohiuddin Jameeli, Asiya Naz Tanoli, Dr. Nelson Azeem, Samina Khalid Ghurki, Ahmed Saleem Siddiqui, Mussarat Rafique Mah­esar, Muneeba Iqbal, Neelam. It was also attended by Minister of State Kesoo Mal Khael Das, as well as the secretary and senior officers from the Ministry of Reli­gious Affairs and Inter-Faith Harmony.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 20th, 2025",
