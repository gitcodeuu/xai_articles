Qatar said it had received no prior warning before the explosions erupted in its capital and Hamas said its senior leadership survived the attack\n\nDuring the meeting, the council denounced Israeli strikes as a “dangerous and unacceptable” provocation.\n\nDelegates in Doha included senior defence officials from all six Gulf states, with the Mohammed Al Mazrouei, the UAE’s Minister of State for Defence Affairs; Bahrain’s Minister of Defence Affairs, Lt Gen Abdullah Al Nuaimi; Saudi Arabia’s Deputy Minister of Defence, Prince Abdulrahman bin Mohammed; Secretary General of the Oman’s Ministry of Defence, Mohammed Al Zaabi; Kuwait’s Minister of Defence Sheikh Abdullah Ali Al Abdullah Al Sabah; and Jasem Al Budaiwi.\n\nThe presence of all ministers underscored, officials said, the urgency of forging a common regional shield.\n\nWhile the GCC has long spoken of greater military integration, efforts have often faltered amid political rivalries and divergent threat perceptions.\n\nThursday’s agreement, amid the gravity of Israel’s unprecedented strike inside Qatar, was presented as a turning point.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 20th, 2025",
