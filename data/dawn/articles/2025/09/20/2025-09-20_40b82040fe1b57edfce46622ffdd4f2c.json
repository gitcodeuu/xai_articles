He said that they took him to an unknown location, which seemed to be an outhouse.\n\nThe complainant said that the kidnappers initially demanded Rs100 million for his safe release and asked him to arrange the ransom amount. However, after negotiations, they agreed upon Rs50m.\n\nHe said that he called his friend Ali Raza, requesting him to arrange the amount, who said that he had only Rs2.5m. The kidnappers turned angry, but later settled for the amount.\n\nThe police say that the kidnappers told Nadeem and his friend Raza that they belonged to a dangerous criminal gang and would kill the former if ransom was not paid.\n\nHe said that his friend Raza paid Rs2.5m to the kidnappers, who also took away Rs1.5m he was carrying, and a two-tola gold chain he was wearing.\n\nNadeem said the kidnappers dropped him near Ring Road and drove away. Thevictim demanded the early arrest of the kidnappers.\n\nA police official said that the investigation police are trying to trace the kidnappers with the help of the Punjab Safe Cities Authority cameras.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 20th, 2025",
