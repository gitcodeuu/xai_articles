He is the thirteenth Doctors Without Borders medic to be killed since the war in Gaza began.\n\n“We are outraged that military violence continues to kill our Palestinian colleagues,” the organisation said in a statement.\n\nAt least 540 aid workers have been killed in Israel’s bombardment of Gaza since Oct 2023.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",
