Eight of the 10 ATCs in Karachi converted into CNS courts had long remained vacant.\n\nInitially, three ATCs were set up in Karachi after the enactment of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997, and two more ATCs were later established in the provincial metropolis. Subsequently, ATC-IV and V were shifted to Larkana and Badin.\n\nIn 2014, seven new ATCs were set up in the city, and 10 more were established during the Karachi operation in 2016.\n\nSHC moved for recovery of two ‘missing’ MQM-L leaders\n\nThe Sindh High Court was moved on Wednesday for recovery of two Muttahida Qaumi Movement-London leaders, including a former lawmaker, who have reportedly gone missing.\n\nCiting the ministry of interior, director general of Rangers Sindh, provincial police chief and others as respondents, petitioner Hassan Nisar contended that his father Nisar Panhwar along with his friend Anwar Tareen had been picked up on Sept 16 by the law enforcement agencies and since then their whereabouts were unknown.\n\nHe asserted that his father had been a victim of enforced disappearances on multiple occasions by law enforcement agencies and it was the fourth such incident highlighting a pattern of illegal abductions targeting political dissidents.\n\nThe petitioner further maintained that Mr Panhwar had served as a Member of the National Assembly from 2003 to 2007 and Provincial Assembly of Sindh from 2008 to 2013.\n\nHe argued that his father was an elderly individual and was known to be suffering from diabetes, which required consistent and specialised care while the petitioner had approached the police to locate the whereabouts of his father, but to no avail.\n\nHe asked the SHC to direct the respondents to make sincere efforts in order to trace the whereabouts of both missing persons.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 18th, 2025",
