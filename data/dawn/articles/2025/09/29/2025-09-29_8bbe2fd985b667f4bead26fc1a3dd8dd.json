The exemptions will be capped at Rs4 billion annually and reviewed every two years. The agreement stated that any attempt to smuggle exempted goods outside GB will lead to partial or complete withdrawal of the concession.\n\nIt was also agreed to expedite tribunal orders regarding pending consignments at Sost Dry Port. The terminal operator will consider waivers on demurrage and port charges. In the agreement, it was agreed that the federal government will issue an SRO on tax exemptions, and a mechanism will be devised. Traders had agreed to immediately wind up their protest. Customs will continue to enforce compliance at Sost as it does at other ports.\n\nThe federal and GB governments also agreed to work on developing border areas, particularly in Gojal, and to consider measures to boost GB’s exports to China.\n\nGB traders’ representatives on Saturday announced calling off the over two-month-long protest sit-in. Addressing traders, GB Supreme Council members announced that Gilgit-Baltistan had been declared a non-tariff area. Ashfaq Ahmed, GB Supreme Council Chairman, who is also the President of the Gilgit Chamber of Commerce, termed it a success. He said the achievement was made possible by unity among GB’s political, social, and business leadership.\n\nKausar Hussain, a GB Supreme Council member, said that taxes imposed in GB following the extension of the Customs Act to GB had finally been rolled back. Kamran Ghazi, another member of the negotiating team, outlined the four-point agenda pursued in Islamabad: tax exemptions, amnesty for stuck consignments, establishment of export facilities, and allocation of funds for border area development. He said the federal government had agreed to allocate a portion of collections for Gojal through the federal finance division, to be reflected in the GB budget.\n\nGB traders’ representatives demanded implementation of the agreement and called off the protest. Pakistan Customs officials said that after the protest was called off, trade operations started between Pakistan and China through the Khunjerab Pass.\n\nAn official said trade activities at Sost Dry Port resumed, transportation between Pakistan and China started, facilitating travel of a large number of stranded passengers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 29th, 2025",
