Instead of ensuring transparency across Sindh’s municipal institutions, the Sindh government is selectively targeting Karachi’s urban workforce. This is clear discrimination,” the statement said.\n\nThe MQM-P leaders argued that if the Sindh government truly wanted fair accountability, it should launch similar inquiries across all municipal corporations and development authorities in the province, rather than singling out the KDA.\n\nThe party said the inquiry appeared designed to delegitimise the outcome of the union elections and suppress the political voice of Karachi’s urban populace.\n\n“This is nothing but political victimisation and an attempt to steal the mandate given by KDA workers to MQM-P. Karachi’s institutions are being weakened and its workforce demoralised under the guise of accountability,” the statement added.\n\nThe MQM-P also warned of a strong public and political response, declaring it would not accept any “anti-labour” decisions or actions that threaten the autonomy and functioning of Karachi’s key development bodies.\n\nMeanwhile, government officials maintain that the inquiry is part of a broader accountability process following the PAC’s earlier findings, which had declared several appointments in the KDA illegal.\n\nThey insist the probe is not politically motivated and is aimed purely at identifying procedural violations and restoring transparency.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 29th, 2025",
