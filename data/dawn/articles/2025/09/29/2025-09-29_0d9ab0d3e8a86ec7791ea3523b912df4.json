Stakeholders, including the Cotton Ginners Forum, identify the failure to enforce crop zoning laws as the primary cause of the persistent decline.\n\nForum Chairman Ihsanul Haq stresses that cotton production and quality cannot improve unless there is a complete ban on sugarcane cultivation in designated cotton zones. Sugarcane cultivation in these areas is known to be detrimental to cotton crops.\n\nHe highlighted the superior quality of cotton grown in less-cultivated areas like Balochistan and Cholistan. Despite minimal use of fertilisers and micronutrients, the cotton produced there yields fiber with greater length and strength than conventional varieties.\n\nThis premium quality earns prices at least Rs500 per 40kg higher for raw cotton (phutti), while the cottonseed (banola) sells for at least Rs1,200 per 40kg more due to its higher oil content.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 29th, 2025",
