Police were investigating the collision’s circumstances.\n\nThe Balochistan government had previously imposed a ban on Iranian smuggled petrol and diesel, which impacted local residents economically, as many families in border areas rely on this trade for their livelihood.\n\nDespite the ban, the Makran administration recently permitted the limited import of petrol and diesel from Iran. Consequently, Iranian petrol has surfaced in the provincial capital of Quetta and other regions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 16th, 2025",
