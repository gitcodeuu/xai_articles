  "content": "An Afghan man was sentenced to life in prison by a German court on Tuesday for a knife attack that killed a police officer and injured five others at an anti-Islam rally last year.\n\nThe verdict comes at a time of heated debate about immigration and security in Germany, and a strong surge in support for the country’s far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\n\nThe defendant, named only as Sulaiman A to protect his privacy, was found guilty of using a large hunting knife to attack people during a demonstration in the western city of Mannheim that was organised by the anti-Islam group Pax Europa in late May 2024.\n\nSulaiman A attacked a speaker and several demonstrators at the event before stabbing a police officer who rushed in to help. The officer later succumbed to his injuries.\n\nThe attacker was taken into pre-trial custody in June 2024 after leaving intensive care for injuries he sustained during his arrest.\n\nThough prosecutors say he sympathised with the Islamic State group, he was not tried as a terrorist. He faced one count of murder and five counts of attempted murder.",
