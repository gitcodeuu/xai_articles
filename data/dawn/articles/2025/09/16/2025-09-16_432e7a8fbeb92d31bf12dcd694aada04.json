There was no mention of the aerial strikes in the official statement.\n\nFive security officials, including army captain, martyred in Kech blast\n\nThe ISPR said that the operations were conducted by the security forces on the reported presence of Khawarij in the area.\n\nThe term ‘Fitna al Khawarij’ is used by the state to refer to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakis­tan (TTP). It said that during the operation in Lakki Marwat, security forces effectively engaged the terrorist location and, after an intense exchange of fire, 14 Indian-sponsored Khawarij were eliminated.\n\n“Another intelligence-based operation was conducted in Bannu, and in the ensuing exchange of fire, 17 more Khawarij were neutralised by the security forces”, the statement added.\n\nThe ISPR said that sanitisation operation was underway to eliminate any remaining Indian-sponsored Khawarij, reaffirming that security forces were determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country.\n\nAn official source said that law enforcement agencies had received credible reports about the movement of terrorists, who were planning subversive and terrorist activities, in the region.\n\nHe said that the presence of khawarij in the Shaikh Badin mountain range in Lakki Marwat district had also been reported, prompting security personnel to be placed on high alert and launch operations.\n\nAccording to the source, the successful operation by security forces would help halt the terrorists’ movements and disrupt their plans.\n\nFive security men martyred\n\nOn the other hand, in Balochistan’s Kech district, five security personnel, including an officer, were martyred in an explosion on Monday.\n\nOfficial sources, while confirming the attack, said that militants planted an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Mand area, near Pak-Iran border. The device was detonated by a remote control to target the vehicle moving between tehsil Dashat and Mand.\n\n“The vehicle was blown up and all five security personnel were martyred,” a senior official told Dawn, identifying the martyred officer as Captain Waqir Kakar.\n\nOther martyred personnel were identified as Naik Junaid, Naik Asmat, Lance Naik Khan Muhammad and Sepoy Zahoor Ahmed.\n\nAfter receiving information about the incident, security forces rushed to the site and shifted the bodies to nearby health facilities.\n\nLater, the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) claimed responsibility for the IED attack.\n\nBalochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti paid tribute in a statement on X, saying: “Another brave son of Balochistan, Captain Waqir Kakar, embraced martyrdom while defending the people and his beloved Pakistan. His sacrifice will forever remain a shining chapter of courage and honour. Balochistan and Pakistan will never forget you.”\n\nSaleem Shahid in Quetta also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 16th, 2025",
