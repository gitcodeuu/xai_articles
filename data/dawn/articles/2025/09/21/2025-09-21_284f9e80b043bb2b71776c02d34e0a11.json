I learned, won, lost, and grew through it all,” Boateng said in a clip uploaded to Instagram which included highlights from his career.\n\n“Football has given me a lot, now it’s time to move on. Not because I have to, but because I’m ready.\n\n“I’m grateful to the teams, the fans, the people who supported me. And above all, my family, my children. They’ve always been there for me.”\n\nThe defender played 76 times for Germany, scoring once.\n\nBoateng won two Champions League titles with Bayern Munich, in 2013 and 2020, as well as nine Bundesliga crowns.\n\nBorn in Berlin, Boateng came through the Hertha Berlin academy alongside his half brother Kevin-Prince, who is one year his senior.\n\nAfter brief spells at Hamburg and Manchester City, Jerome Boateng moved to Bayern.\n\nSince leaving Bayern in 2021, Boateng bounced around clubs in several countries, playing for Olympique Lyonnais in France, Salernitana in Italy and LASK in Austria.\n\nHe terminated his contract with LASK in mid-August.\n\nLate in his career, Boateng was dogged by a trial relating to domestic violence allegations alleged by his ex-wife. After a review process, he received a warning and a suspended fine.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 21st, 2025",
