Whether defective investigation, inadequate prosecutorial oversight, and delays or improper application of law and procedure by criminal courts are contributing factors to the low conviction rate in the country, particularly in the province of KP?\n\nWhether the investigation branch of police is fully independent of the operational branch so as to effectively and independently perform its statutory duties? Whether the existing substantive and procedural criminal laws in force in KP are sufficient to meet the needs of modern times, particularly with reference to strengthening of CJS or whether they stand in need of revision?\n\nWhether there exists any proper and effective oversight mechanism to hold various stakeholders of CJS, such as judiciary, police, prosecution, investigating officers, medico-legal officers, and jail authorities, accountable for non-compliance with their statutory duties and other mandatory provisions?\n\nWhether independent forensic laboratory exists in KP, and if not, whether any measures have been taken to establish the same or otherwise? Whether prosecution is fulfilling its statutory duties as envisaged under KP Prosecution Service (Constitution, Functions and Powers) Act, 2005, including but not limited to the duty of prosecutorial supervision?\n\nWhether the failure of prosecution to submit Challans within the statutory period of 14 days, as mandated under Section 173 CrPC, amounts to a violation of fundamental rights of under-trial prisoners guaranteed under articles 4, 9, and 10-A of the Constitution, and whether such failure entails penal or compensatory consequences? Whether criminal trials are being concluded within the statutory period or not; and whether the law provides any remedial measures in cases where trials are not concluded within the specified period?\n\nThe bench also directed the DG prosecution to submit details about current pendency of cases before the prosecution department; number of district public prosecutors (DPPs) against whom departmental action was taken for poor oversight and low conviction rate; the number of cases in which DPPs had recommended action against investigating officers to relevant district police officers and their outcome; etc.\n\nSimilarly, the bench also put multiple questions to KP Forensic Science Agency, provincial health secretary and DIG investigation, directing them to submit their respective reports in the light of the said questions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 21st, 2025",
