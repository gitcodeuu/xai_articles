Some who had already boarded planes disembarked for fear they might not be allowed to re-enter.\n\nData released by the US Department of Homeland Security showed there were 422,335 Indian students in the United States in 2024, an increase of 11.8 per cent on the year before.\n\nIndia’s IT industry association Nasscom said soon after Friday’s initial announcement that it was concerned by the new visa measures.\n\nIt said “business continuity” at technology companies would be disrupted, and was quick to point out how Indian IT firms contributed to the US economy and were “by no means” a security threat.\n\nShashwath VS, a 20-year-old chemical engineering student in Bengaluru, said the new fee was too high for companies to think about sponsoring a foreign candidate.\n\n“I will now explore other countries… going to the US was a priority for me, but not anymore,” Shashwath said.\n\nHe said many like him might try to find places elsewhere, such as Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\n\nIndians, he said, “contribute significantly to the American economy — be it students who go there or people who work there”.\n\n“So they (the US) will also be hit, in one way or the other.”\n\nTrump has had the H-1B programme in his sights since his first term in office, and the current visa iteration has become the latest move in a major immigration crackdown in his second term.\n\nSilicon Valley companies rely on Indian workers who either relocate to the United States or come and go between the two countries.\n\nIndia’s own vast outsourcing industry has also depended on the work permits for decades, even though that has softened in recent years.\n\nIndustry leader Tata Consultancy Services alone received approval for more than 5,000 H-1B visas in the first half of the 2025 fiscal year.\n\nSahil, a 37-year-old senior manager at an India-based consultancy firm, returned from the United States last year after living there on an H-1B visa for almost seven years.\n\n“I can tell every second or third person in the IT sector dreams of settling in the US or visiting to work,” he said.\n\n“We will see fewer Indians migrating to the US in the future. That possibly means those people will now start looking at other countries.“",
