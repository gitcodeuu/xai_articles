  "content": "India romped home in style with a six-wicket win, chasing down the 172-run target with ease in their second high-intensity encounter against Pakistan in the men’s Asia Cup in Dubai on Sunday.\n\nAbhishek Sharma was adjudicated player-of-the-match — scoring 74 runs of 39 balls as he led the Indian effort from the front after getting a reprieve in Shaheen’s second over.\n\nThe bitterness between the players, which started with India’s refusal of customary handshakes in the first encounter, continued as Sharma at the post-match ceremony said: “Today it was very simple, the way they were coming (at) us for no reason, I didn’t like it at all, and this is the only way I could give [an answer] with my bat.”\n\nPakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha, speaking after the match, said, “We are yet to play the perfect game. We batted really well — but I think when it came to the bowling, they took the game away in the powerplay.”\n\nHe said they could have got 15 more runs after being 91 in the first 10 overs, but added that 171 was still a good total.\n\nThe Indian skipper Suryakumar Yadav appreciated the character shown by his team after being behind in the game after the first innings.\n\nThe Indian opening batters, after early reprieves, made a mockery of a decent score by the Pakistani batters as the Men in Blue chased down their highest score against the Green Shirts in men’s T20Is.\n\nIn the first innings, the Indian bowlers — barring Shivam Dube — had no answers to the Pakistani onslaught with the bat. The Men in Blue’s fielding was nervy and even worse than their bowling effort, with multiple dropped chances.\n\nPakistan’s batters smashed both the Indian pacers and the spinners on a dry pitch that got better as the match continued — with India making full use of the easier conditions.\n\nDube was the only redeeming aspect of the Indian bowling effort, as he got crucial wickets in the middle overs and dried up scoring — Pakistan going 39 balls without boundaries after being in a commanding position of 91-1 after 10 overs.\n\nNearly all the Pakistani batters had a commendable day with the bat as India were under pressure from ball one with the start Fakhar got. They ultimately got to their highest score batting first against India in men’s T20Is — on the back of Sahibzada’s 50 and some late-order hitting by Faheem and skipper Salman.\n\nFakhar’s controversial dismissal was a major talking point, after the southpaw opener was given out by the third umpire caught by the keeper, though visuals showed that there was definitely room for doubt whether the ball carried — which usually goes in the batter’s favour.\n\nBut the Green Shirts had continued with their tradition of facing opponents with one hand tied behind their backs. They had picked Hussain Talat in a bid to strengthen their batting — but at the expense of leaving out their big hitters like Hassan Nawaz and Khushdil Shah.\n\nTwo out of three Pakistani pacers continued the tradition of Pakistani fastmen troubling Indian batters — with Haris Rauf in particular giving the Men in Blue a run for their money on a placid pitch.\n\nHe made a mess of Sanju Samson’s middle-stump and got the Indian skipper out for a duck with his express pace as well — giving away just 26 runs in his four overs.\n\nPakistan still have one more potential chance of redemption against the Men in Blue — if they build on the positives in this game and play well across both departments to reach the Asia Cup final next Sunday.\n\n18.1: Shaheen starts with an absolute beast of a yorker, but Pandya manages to keep it out.\n\n18.2: Pandya swings and misses.\n\nThat’s a 92m six for Verma, and he follows it up with a flick to the fine-leg boundary.\n\nThat’s all for today, folks, as India make easy work of this tricky chase.\n\nFaheem comes in to bowl.\n\nSeems a matter of time for India now. Pakistan needed a tight over but Faheem was wayward and was duly dispatched for six on the second ball. 10 runs come off it and India are now nine away from victory.\n\n16.4: Haris strikes with a jaffa! He delivers an absolute peach of a delivery thats makes a mess of Samson’s stumps!\n\n16.5: Hardik Pandya gets off the mark with a four through midwicket. Haris is not impressed.\n\nPakistan needed a breakthrough, and Haris struck. Samson tried to play across but missed the ball completely and saw his stumps shattered on the fourth ball of the over.\n\nAny hopes of a shift in momentum, however, were quickly snuffed out by Hardik Pandya’s nonchalant flick for four on the first ball he faced. Haris has bowled his quota of four; India need 19 off the last three overs.\n\nAbrar continues and nearly gets another Indian wicket!\n\nLuck goes India’s way as a miscued shot from Samson lands perfectly between three fielders. Pakistan could’ve done with a wicket there but that’s how the game’s been for them. India need 27 runs from the last four overs to win. Is there a miracle in store for Pakistan?\n\nSalman turns to Shaheen to be the provider for his side, but Tilak Verma gets his first boundary.\n\nIndia get eight runs off the over, now 32 runs away from winning — again.\n\nFaheem continues but another wicket proves elusive for Pakistan as the incoming Sanju Samson plays a delightful cover drive for four. India closing in on target with six runs coming off the over.\n\nThey need 40 runs off the last six overs. Pakistan need a wicket or two and needed it yesterday!\n\nAbrar strikes and gets rid of Abhishek! The Indian batter does not bother to look up as he walks off.\n\nAbhishek seemed primed to finish the game single-handedly, but after welcoming Abrar with a six, he went for another and was caught by Haris. India is still on top, but Pakistan have more than a sniff.\n\nSanju Samson is the next man in for India.\n\nFaheem comes back in the attack and is immediately lifted down the ground for four by Abhishek. The India opener shows cuts away Faheem for another boundary three balls later. India get 11 off the over and Pakistan need to regain some inspiration.\n\nIndian skipper Suryakumar is at the crease. He looks tense.\n\nHaris strikes as the Indian captain departs! Suryakumar top-edged that pacey Haris delivery down to third-man, where Abrar held his nerve.\n\nThe big-hitting Tilak Verma is the next man in for the Men in Blue.\n\nThings get better for Pakistan. A fired-up Haris sends back Suryakumar. The right-armer’s pace proves to be the undoing for the India skipper, who gets a leading edge and is caught by Abrar on the boundary. Haris gives away just one run in the over. Pakistan getting back in the contest.\n\nThere is a stoppage in play as Shubman was limping while running.\n\nFaheem wrecks Shubman stumps! Pakistan draw first blood!\n\nOverheard in the newsroom: Is this the start of the Indian collapse?!\n\nFaheem was brought into the attack as Pakistan desperately sought a breakthrough and the right-armer found the perfect line with an inswinger to knock Gill’s off-stump. Suryakumar swings and misses first ball. The question is can Pakistan claw they way back?\n\nA tidy over by Haris — just five off it — but India are cruising to the target.\n\nSaim continues and Gill excels with a reverse hit for four before Abhishek brings up his half-century with a four. Pakistan look bereft of ideas. 11 runs off the over and India closing in on 100 runs.\n\nSahibzada returns the favour from the first innings by palming Abhishek over the boundary for six, what could have been a dismissal is another six!\n\nChange of ends for Abrar, but it doesn’t work for Pakistan as Abhishek launches him into the stands on the second ball of the over. Luck also not going Pakistan’s way as Sahibzada helps another big hit from Abhishek over the fence. Runs keep coming for India — and fast. 16 off the over. India firmly in the driving seat.\n\nThe power play has been completely dominated by the Indian batters after an early reprieve.\n\nSaim is brought back into the attack but to no avail as Abhishek hits him down the ground for four and Gill cuts him away for another boundary two deliveries later and finishes it off with another. 14 runs off the over. India firmly on top and Pakistan seem to have no answer.\n\nThe express pace of Haris is something that Indian batters seem to struggle against — let’s see if he can get the breakthrough for Pakistan.\n\nHaris Rauf replaces Shaheen from the other end for the fifth over. Abhishek’s edge on the second ball flies away for four on the second ball and he has an exchange of words with Haris. It’s heated in the middle with both sets of players under pressure to deliver. India seem to be dealing with it better and Gill swats away Haris to finish the over. 12 off the over again.\n\nMystery spinner Abrar into the attack.\n\nPakistan continue with spin from the other end as Abrar Ahmed replaces Saim. Abrar kept it tight on the first three balls but Abhishek then cut loose; pulling him for a four and a six. Another 12 runs come off the over. India are off to a fast start and Pakistan need to respond.\n\n2.3: Shaheen nearly had his man! Abhishek is dropped by Nawaz running back. It was a tough chance.\n\nThere were some words exchanged after Gill hit the boundary on the final ball of Shaheen’s over.\n\nCould that Abhishek drop be a ‘what if’ moment for Pakistan? Gill powered him down the ground for four off the next ball and then finished the over with a slap for another boundary on the off-side. India get 12 off the over; a breakthrough becomes crucial for Pakistan.\n\nSaim — Pakistan’s highest wicket-taker in the tournament — made a tidy start but was then swept for four by Shubman Gill on the fourth ball, before being cut away for another on the next ball. India get 10 from the over. Pakistan need to make inroads.\n\nShaheen bowls to Abhishek Sharma. This is the redemption arc we have been waiting for!\n\n0.1: Shaheen bounces Sharma first ball, but he is up to the task and hits it for six off the very first ball.\n\nShaheen — the player of the match in Pakistan’s last outing, tightened things up with just three more runs coming in the over.\n\nMid-match analysis by Abyan Amir: The Indian bowlers had no answers to the Pakistani onslaught with the bat. The Men in Blue’s fielding was nervy and even worse with multiple dropped chances!\n\nPakistan made a mockery of both the Indian pacers and the spinners on a dry pitch that will get better as the match continues — India will be pinning their hopes on dew coming to rescue later in the innings after they had an ordinary day in the field.\n\nNearly all the Pakistani batters had a terrific day with the bat as India were under pressure from ball one with the start, Fakhar got — getting to their highest score batting first against India in men’s T20Is.\n\nFakhar’s controversial dismissal was a major talking point after the southpaw opener was given out by the third umpire, and visuals showed that there was definitely room for doubt — which usually goes in the batter’s favour.\n\nThis is shaping up to be the redemption bid for the Green Shirts that they needed — and deserved!\n\n19.2: Edged for four as India continue to have a bad day with the ball.\n\nPandya smashes the ball in the ground in frustation as Pakistan continue to pile up the runs!\n\nThe last ball of the innings is smacked by Faheem over cover for a tremendous six!\n\nPakistan needed to finish with a flourish, and Faheem’s top edge flew for four on the second ball off the last over by Pandya. The Indian all-rounder then gave away just three runs off the next three balls — one of them a wide — before Faheem ended it with a slash for six. Pakistan will feel they have a defendable total on the board.\n\nBumrah is back into the attack after being smacked to all corners of the ground in his first spell!\n\nBowls a great yorker after starting the over with a wide.\n\nBrain-fade moment for Nawaz as he gets run out in cavalier fashion.\n\nFaheem treats Bumrah with scant regard as he launches that full toss for six over fine leg!\n\nThe day continues to get worse for India’s ace pacer.\n\nBumrah was taken apart by Pakistan in his first three overs but found his nagging line in the fourth.\n\nTwo searing yorkers were blocked by Nawaz at the start of the penultimate over. Nawaz then gets sloppy with his running to be dismissed. Good thing for Pakistan, though, is that the incoming Faheem wasted no time in getting off the mark and did that with a six off the first ball before being dropped by Gill in the deep.\n\n11 runs off the over as India’s woes with the ball continue to get worse!\n\nGo Nawaz Go!\n\n17.1: Nawaz launches Dube for six over wide long-on!\n\n17 of that over!\n\nPakistan finally get a move on with Nawaz, at long last, nailing a big hit. The left-hander started the 18th over by Dube with a six and got two off the next ball. A slash off the third flew for four, and 17 runs came off the over.\n\nSkipper Salman launches Kuldeep straight down the ground for six over long-off!\n\nThe Men in Blue are clutching at straws right now\n\n16.3: That ball clearly pitched outside leg —but the Indian skipper went up for a review, hoping against hope for some luck!\n\nThe boundary drought — lasting 39 — finally ended with Salman smashing Kuldeep for six down the ground. The spinner burned a review two balls later, trying to get the Pakistan skipper lbw. Salman tried for more big hits, but only succeeded in getting two more runs in the over.\n\nIndia keeping things tight. Nawaz fails to get Chakravarthy away, plays four dot balls. Just two runs coming off the over.\n\nSahibzada departs after a valiant effort with the bat!\n\nHis dismissal shows that the ball is gripping in the wicket and cutters will be a useful ploy in the second innings.\n\nIndia’s pressure pays off with Dube accounting for Sahibzada, who was looking to end the boundary drought and only managed to find to India skipper Suryakumar Yadav at mid-off after losing his bat.\n\nPakistan captain Salman Ali Agha strides in and needs to give his side a move on. India seems happy giving away the singles as far as there are no boundaries — it’s now 33 balls since the last one.\n\nKuldeep finally has a wicket as Hussain Talat departs for a scratchy 10 of 11 balls.\n\nThe in-form Mohammad Nawaz is the next man in.\n\nHussain made 10 off 10 before departing when he tried to reverse sweep Yadav. Indian fielders have blown hot and cold during the match. After a lapse allowed Sahibzada to complete two runs, Shubman Gill denied Pakistan a chance to end their boundary drought when he prevented a pull from the incoming Mohammad Nawaz from reaching the fence. Five runs off the over.\n\nDube returns, can he rescue this Indian bowling effort from sinking even further?\n\nIndia keep Dube on and Pakistan keep the scoreboard ticking with seven runs coming off the over. However, they have not managed a boundary since 21 deliveries now. Both Sahibzada and Hussain will be looking to get a move on now.\n\nPakistan look a side changed from the previous clash between the two sides. Good running between the wickets, taking three runs after Hussain’s cheeky shot off his legs to bring up their 100. The boundaries might have dried, but Pakistan take seven runs off Chakravarthy’s over\n\nIndia finally holds onto one as Saim gets dismissed by Dube.\n\nIndia brought on Shivam Dube into the attack to quell Pakistan’s onslaught and reaped reward when Saim top-edged to Abhishek, who clung on this time running in from the deep backward square leg. Hussain Talat, making his first appearance in the tournament, got off the mark first ball but then played three dots and didn’t make much of a free hit.\n\nIndia have a tidy over at last, just five off it.\n\nMid-innings analysis by Abyan Amir: The Indian bowlers have no answers to this Pakistani onslaught. The Men in Blue’s fielding has been even worse with multiple dropped chances!\n\nPakistan have made a mockery of both the Indian pacers and the spinners on a dry pitch that will only get better as the match continues.\n\nFakhar’s controversial dismissal continues to be a talking point, after the southpaw opener was given out by the third umpire and visuals showed that there was definitely room for doubt.\n\nSahibzada hits Axar Patel for a huge six!\n\nPakistan are on the ascendancy and showing it. Sahibzada brought up his 50 with a stunning pull off Axar Patel for six. After the first half of their innings, they’re well and truly on top.\n\nSahibzada brings up his 50 in style with a gun salute!\n\nSaim finally showing a glimpse of his old self and that should make Pakistan happy. He went down the track against Yadav and smashed him over his head for six. Sahibzada did the same and his shot flew over the long -on fence. Pakistan are taking on the Indian bowlers, dispatching the balls on merit, and reaping the rewards. Thirteen runs off the over.\n\n8.1: Saim welcomes Kuldeep with a huge six down the ground!\n\nThe Indian bowlers have no response to this Pakistani onslaught!\n\n8.3: The absolute domination by the Pakistani batters of the Indian attack continues as Sahibzada launches that ball into the second tier!\n\n7.3: FLAT SIX FOR SAHIBZADA! Tipped over the long-on boundary by Abhishek, who, along with the rest of the Indian team, is having an atrocious day in the field.\n\nSahibzada went after Varun and hit the first six of the innings — albeit helped by the long-on fielder. Pakistan continue with their momentum, 10 runs coming off the over.\n\nKuldeep Yadav has for long been Pakistan’s tormentor and so Saim and Sahibzada are naturally wary against playing any loose shots. Five runs of his first over as Pakistan continue their solid start, thankfully.\n\n5.2: Sahibzada smacks that short of a length ball by Bumrah with utter disdain for four!\n\nPakistan are making a statement with this dominating start.\n\nFakhar’s controversial dismissal continues to be a talking point.\n\n5.5: 50 up for Pakistan as yet another full toss from Bumrah. Driven past him, mid-off runs back and the batters hare back for three. Fifty up for Pakistan!\n\nBumrah hasn’t had the desired impact for India in his first two overs and has changed ends. It didn’t change anything for him as Sahibzada smashed him to the mid-on boundary for four and then smashed him to the mid-off fence off the last ball. Pakistan are off to a flyer in the powerplay. Thirteen runs off the over and — by the looks of it — headed to a big score.\n\nIndia bring in spin to stem Pakistan’s run flow, Varun Chakravarthy is into the attack in just the 5th over of the innings.\n\n4.3: The Men in Blue are having a terrible day in the field as Kuldeep drops a sitter and gives Saim another life!\n\nCelebrations in the newsroom as Saim gets an undeserved reprieve. That’s a relief!\n\nIndia turned to spin after Pakistan made hay against the pacers. Varun Chakravarthy gave just one run off the first three balls he bowled and Saim took him on, an attempted sweep getting a top edge which was spilled by Yadav at fine leg. Pakistan rode their luck and another edge, this time off Saibzada’s bat, flew to the third man fence.\n\nBumrah returns after being hit for 11 by Fakhar in the first over.\n\n3.1: Sahibzada gets his first boundary, pulling Bumrah away with utter disdain.\n\nTV replays show Fakhar seemingly upset about the TV umpire’s call. To be fair, it wasn’t clear where the ball bounced, but the TV umpire seemed to believe it bounced on the glove.\n\n3.4: Bumrah gets smashed for four by Sahibzada, pressure on the Indian pacer as it’s a no-ball above waist height.\n\nSahibzada gets on the act, pulling Bumrah away for four to start the over and then slapped a full toss — adjudged to be above waist height— to the mid-wicket fence. Current run rate is a neat 9.00. Pakistan have a start and now needs to capitalise on it.\n\n2.2: Fakhar hits Pandya for four now!\n\n2.3: Fakhar is out after nicking off Pandya, but that seemed like it bounced in front of the keeper’s gloves, a controversial call by the umpire. India draw first blood.\n\n2.5: Saim finally ends his own personal boycott of the Asia Cup with a sublime boundary off Pandya.\n\nFakhar started the over by slashing Pandya to the point boundary, but India were soon up in celebration as the left-hander was caught on the next ball. The ball seemed to have died on its way to Samson’s gloves but the TV umpire — controversially — adjudged that it bounced off the keeper’s glove and into his hand. Saim Ayub belatedly got his first runs of the tournament, pulling Pandya away on the second ball he faced.\n\n1.1: Fakhar dances down the wicket to greet Bumrah and got two.\n\n1.3: Fakhar flicks Bumrah for four, who’s under pressure from the get-go! First boundary for Pakistan.\n\n1.4: Fakhar smashes Bumrah down the ground after dancing down the wicket. Fakhar is off to a flyer!\n\nFakhar shows his intentions from the start. A slow outfield prevented him from starting off with a four, but he found a boundary with a flick on the legside on the third ball and then danced down the track and dispatched Jasprit Bumrah to the long-off fence on the next ball. Solid start from Pakistan\n\nPakistan shuffle batting order, with Fakhar Zaman opening instead of Saim Ayub.\n\nThe newsroom wanted Shaheen Afridi to open, so they are a bit disappointed.\n\n0.3: The Men in Blue have given Pakistan their first chance as Abhishek Sharma drops Sahibzada at deep third-man.\n\n0.4: Shouts of shot as Sahibzada launches Pandya down the ground, but it doesn’t go far! 2 runs taken.\n\nPakistan 6/0 Sahibzada gets lucky as he’s dropped by Abhishek Sharma on the third ball of the match. The Pakistan opener looked to go after Hardik Pandya, hitting him down the ground the next ball. Pakistan will be relieved they’ve ended the first over with no losses and six runs on the board.\n\nThe Pakistani anthem is played first as the anthems are played without any incident, unlike last Sunday’s encounter.\n\nThe Green Shirts had two changes, bringing in Hussain Talat for Hassan Nawaz and Faheem Ashraf for Khushdil Shah.\n\nThe Men in Blue brought in Jasprit Bumrah and Varun Chakravarthy.\n\nTeams:\n\nPakistan: Saim Ayub, Sahibzada Farhan, Fakhar Zaman, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Mohammad Haris, Hussain Talat, Faheem Ashraf, Mohammad Nawaz, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Abrar Ahmed.\n\nIndia: Abhishek Sharma, Shubman Gill, Suryakumar Yadav, Tilak Verma, Sanju Samson, Hardik Pandya, Shivam Dube, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and Jasprit Bumrah.\n\nThe Green Shirts have a chance at redemption as they face India again today in Dubai for the Super Four stage of the Men’s Asia Cup after their last game was marred by a controversy spiralling from the neighbouring team’s refusal to shake hands with their opponents.\n\nThe Group A clash between the fierce rivals last Sunday — their first meeting since the four-day military conflict between them in May — ended on a bitter note when the Men in Blue refused to shake hands with the Green Shirts after winning the game. There were no handshakes between the captains at the toss either.\n\nAccording to Reuters, Indian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for today’s clash, which is scheduled for 7:30pm PKT at the Dubai International Stadium.\n\nMatch referee Andy Pycroft, whose removal was sought by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) over the controversy but was denied by the International Cricket Council (ICC), is still scheduled to officiate today.\n\nAsked about the handshake issue and Pycroft’s presence yesterday, Indian captain Suryakumar Yadav changed the subject, saying, “It will be a good contest between the ball and the bat”.\n\nHe added: “Close your room, switch off your phone and sleep. I think that’s the best thing to shut the noise. It’s easy to say, but sometimes it is difficult.”\n\nIndia won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.\n\nSuryakumar, who had seemingly politicised last Sunday’s victory by bringing up the Pahalgam terrorist attack in India-occupied Kashmir, said: “I have been very clear with all the boys. I think it’s very important if you want to do well in this tournament and going forward.\n\n“We will have to shut a lot of noise from outside and take what is good for you.”\n\nDespite India’s triumph in their previous encounter, Suryakumar insisted past results would count for nothing when the rivals meet again in today’s Super Four match.\n\n“I feel our preparation has been really good leading into the tournament. We have also had three good games, so we are actually focusing on what we can do best,” he added.\n\n“We want to follow all the good habits that we have been doing from the last two or three games. We take it one game at a time. It doesn’t give us an edge that we have played them once, and we had a good game. We have to start from scratch.”\n\nPakistan had cancelled their pre-match press conference yesterday, making it the second consecutive time that they did so following the handshake incident.\n\nLast night, PCB Chairman Mohsin Naqvi met with the Green Shirts in Dubai as they participated in warm-up exercises for today’s match.\n\nEarlier this week, the situation escalated to the point that the PCB was even mulling its participation in the Asia Cup after the ICC rejected its complaint seeking the removal of Pycroft, who PCB said told captain Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with his Indian counterpart before the match.\n\nHowever, the situation was finally settled when, just before Pakistan’s match against the United Arab Emirates on Wednesday, the PCB said Pycroft “apologised” to the Green Shirts’ manager and captain over the ruckus resulting from “miscommunication”.\n\nNevertheless, the tournament still had lingering disputes; the ICC reportedly took exception to the PCB recording Pycroft’s “apology” meeting with Pakistan team officials. The event had been marred by controversy before it even began, with calls for a boycott of the game from across the border.",
