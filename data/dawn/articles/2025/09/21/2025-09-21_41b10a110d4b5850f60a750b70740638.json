  "content": "BEIRUT: Lebanon said an Israeli strike killed one person in the south on Sat­urday, the latest deadly attack despite a months-old ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nA correspondent saw first responders attending the scene in the Mar­jayoun area, where the partially burnt-out wreckage of a white vehicle sat beside the road.\n\n“The Israeli enemy strike on a vehicle on the Al-Khardali road killed one person,” the health ministry said in a statement.\n\nIsrael has continued to carry out attacks on Leb­a­non despite the November truce that sought to end more than a year of hostilities with the group. It has also maintained troops in five areas of the south it deems strategic. The Isra­eli military has said previous strikes targeted suspe­cted Hezbo­l­lah fighters or facilities. On Friday, Israeli strikes kil­led two people in the south the military said were Hezbollah operatives.\n\nA day earlier, the Israeli military said it struck Hez­bollah weapons storage fac­ilities in several areas after urging civilians to flee.\n\nIn the face of heavy US pressure and fears of expa­nded Israeli strikes, the Lebanese government is seeking to disarm Hezbo­l­lah. Foreign Minister You­ssef Raggi has said the army will complete the disarmament of its militants in the border area within three months.\n\nThe army said Thur­sday’s strikes took Israeli violations of the ceasefire to 4,500 and warned they risked slowing down Hezbollah’s disarmament.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 21st, 2025",
