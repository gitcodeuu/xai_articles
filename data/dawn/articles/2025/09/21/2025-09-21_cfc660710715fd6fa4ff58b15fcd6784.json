A poll released by YouGov on Friday showed two-thirds of young Britons aged 18-25 supported Palestinian statehood.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister David Lammy acknowledged at the UN in July that “Britain bears a special burden of responsibility to support the two-state solution”.\n\nOver a century ago, the UK was pivotal in laying the groundwork for the creation of the state of Israel through the 1917 Balfour Declaration.\n\nThree-quarters of UN members already recognise Palestinian statehood, with over 140 of the 193 having taken the step.\n\nStarmer said in July that his Labour government intended to recognise a Palestinian State unless Israel took “substantive” steps, including reaching a ceasefire in Gaza, getting more aid into the territory and confirming it would not annex the West Bank.\n\nStarmer has also repeatedly called on Hamas to release the remaining hostages they captured in the 2023 attack, and is expected to set out new sanctions on the Palestinian group.\n\nLammy told the BBC on Sunday that the Palestinian Authority — the civilian body that governs in areas of the West Bank — had been calling for the move for some time, “and I think a lot of that is wrapped up in hope”.\n\n“Will this feed children? No, it won’t, that’s down to humanitarian aid. Will this free hostages? That must be down to a ceasefire.” But he said it was an attempt to “hold out for” a two-state solution.\n\nPalestinian foreign minister Varsen Aghabekian Shahin told AFP last week: “Recognition is not symbolic. It sends a very clear message to the Israelis on their illusions on continuing their occupation forever,” she said.\n\nHamas’s 2023 attack on southern Israel resulted in the deaths of 1,219 people, most of them civilians, according to an AFP tally of official figures. Israel’s retaliatory campaign has killed at least 65,208 people, also mostly civilians, according to figures from the Gaza health ministry that the United Nations considers reliable.\n\nPortugal said that it would also formally declare its recognition in New York on Sunday.\n\n“By acting now, as the Portuguese government has decided, we’re keeping alive the possibility of having two states,” Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa said.",
