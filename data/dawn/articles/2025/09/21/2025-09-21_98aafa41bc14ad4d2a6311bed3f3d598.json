Despite the recent floods, Kartarpur and other gurdwaras were reopened for pilgrims within 24 hours, which demonstrates Pakistan’s seriousness and commitment, he added.\n\nAdditional Secretary Shrines Nasser Mushtaq stated that PSGPC and ETPB were continuously working to enhance facilities for Sikh pilgrims and ensure complete religious freedom for those visiting Pakistan.\n\nHe said Pakistan was fully prepared to host Sikh pilgrims from India and across the world. “This is why pilgrims, upon returning home, chant ‘Pakistan Zindabad’ and carry messages of love and peace.”\n\nThe meeting also called upon the international community and the United Nations to take effective measures to stop India from violating religious freedom.\n\nThose present at the meeting included PSGPC General Secretary Satwant Kaur, Vice President Sardar Mahesh Singh, Dr. Sardar Mimpal Singh, Sardar Tara Singh, Sardar Gyan Singh, Sardar Satwant Singh, Sardar Hameet Singh, Sardar Sahib Singh, and Sardar Bhagat Singh.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 21st, 2025",
