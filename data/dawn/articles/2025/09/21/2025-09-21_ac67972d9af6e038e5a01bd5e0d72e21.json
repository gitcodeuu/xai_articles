The board alleged that Pycroft told Pakistan skipper Salman Ali Agha not to shake hands with Indian counterpart Yadav before the match.\n\nPakistan’s last group game — which they won easily against the United Arab Emirates — was delayed for an hour due to the stand-off before the matter was resolved with Pycroft’s apology.\n\nIndian media have reported that the team plans to stick to its no-handshake policy for Sunday’s clash.\n\nIndia won all three of their group games, narrowly edging out a brave Oman by 21 runs in Abu Dhabi on Friday, as well as beating Pakistan by seven and the UAE by nine wickets respectively.\n\nFormer PCB chairperson Ramiz Raja said Pakistan “need to reset their strategy as it’s not working out.”\n\nSpeaking on Geo News programme Naya Pakistan, “This strategy, which is akin to a sparkler that fizzles out quickly, is not working out at all,” the former Pakistan men’s captain said.\n\nThe team needs to get to a 150+ score first, Ramiz said, adding that the over-reliance on all-rounders was not the way to go.\n\n“If Saim Ayub or Hassan Nawaz are critical players and if they fire tomorrow, then I see Pakistan competing with India,” Ramiz said.\n\nHe also said that the dot-ball percentage needed to go down for the Green Shirts.\n\nSpeaking on the Indian team’s refusal to shake hands, he said, “Who resorts to things like this in this day and age?”\n\nPCB chairperson Mohsin Naqvi also met the team ahead of the Pakistan-India clash in Dubai.\n\nLast Sunday’s match had been coloured from the start by calls from across the border to boycott the fixture. It seems the pressure got to the players as well, with the Indian team refusing to shake hands, as is customary, at the toss and after the match.\n\nA potential third India-Pakistan showdown looms if both sides qualify for the final on September 28 in Dubai.\n\nIndia lifted the Asia Cup in its last, 50-over edition and were the favourites to retain the crown.\n\nPakistan and India advanced to the next stage from Group ‘A’, while Sri Lanka and Bangladesh qualified from Group ‘B’.\n\nAlong with regional bragging rights, the Asia Cup serves as a build-up towards the T20 World Cup in February-March in India and Sri Lanka.",
