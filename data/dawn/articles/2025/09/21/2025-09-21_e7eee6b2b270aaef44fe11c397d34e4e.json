He said that unannounced loadshedding, low voltage and frequent transformer breakdowns were creating serious difficulties for residents.\n\nBoth sides underlined the urgent need to upgrade the electricity system and replace outdated lines and transformers to ensure uninterrupted supply to Gwadar city and surrounding areas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 19th, 2025",
