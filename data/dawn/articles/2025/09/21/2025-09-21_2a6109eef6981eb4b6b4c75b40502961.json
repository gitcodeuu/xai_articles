  "content": "The bodies of three transgender individuals were recovered from Karachi’s Memon Goth on Sunday, police and rescue officials said.\n\nThe bodies were found with bullet holes, a statement from the Edhi Information Centre said, adding that ambulances were present at the scene.\n\nThe Karachi Police Media Cell (KPMC) reported that a crime scene unit had been called, saying that further investigation into the incident was underway.\n\nSindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has issued orders to the inspector-general of police for the immediate arrest of the killers, according to a notice issued by the CM House today.\n\n“The murderers of transgender persons should be arrested at all costs, and a report should be submitted to me,” the chief minister instructed.\n\n“Transgender persons belong to the oppressed section of society that we all have to respect and honour. The state will not tolerate the killing of any oppressed and innocent citizen,” he added.\n\nA spokesperson added that the chief minister had sought details of the incident.\n\nA research report jointly compiled this year by Blue Veins and the National Commission on Human Rights found that many transgender individuals in Pakistan experience social exclusion, including rejection by families, employment discrimination and violence, pushing them further into vulnerability.\n\nIn July, armed motorcyclists killed a transgender person in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Malakand division. The same month, another transgender person was shot dead by unidentified persons in the Tehkal area of Peshawar.\n\nLast year, two transgender persons were stabbed to death in Mardan by assailants, who fled the scene after committing the crime, according to the police.",
