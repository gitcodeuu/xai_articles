  "content": "TOKYO: Emmanuel Wanyonyi and Beatrice Chebet made it a memorable night for Kenya at the world championships on Saturday as they produced outstanding performances to win the men’s 800 metres and women’s 5,000m, respectively.\n\nJust over a year ago the duo left Paris as Olympic champions, while Chebet won both the 5,000 and 10,000m golds.\n\nWanyonyi timed a championship record of 1min 41.86sec for gold in Tokyo, just four hundredths of a second ahead of Algeria’s fast-finishing Djamel Sedjati.\n\nDefending champion Marco Arop of Canada had to settle for bronze in 1:41.95 in a reshuffle of the podium places with Sedjati from last year’s Paris Olympics.\n\nOn Saturday, in front of over 58,000 spectators at Japan’s National Stadium, she achieved the same feat, beating her idol Faith Kipyegon to become only the third woman to do the distance double at a world championships.\n\nWanyonyi’s blisteringly fast race was watched by retired Kenyan 800m legend David Rudisha, who sat beside another man who knows a thing or two about the two-lap race, two-time Olympic silver medallist and World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe.\n\nRudisha produced one of the all-time great Olympic performances when he broke the world record to win gold at the 2012 London Games.\n\nThere was never any question of that happening in Saturday’s final, Wanyonyi winning in a championship record time of 1min 41.86sec.\n\nHowever, Rudisha has all but anointed the 21-year-old former cattle herder as the man most likely to set a new record.\n\n“Maybe I will start to think about the world record,” Wonyonyi said.\n\n“I also want to win gold in Los Angeles in 2028. That’s the biggest goal.\n\n“I met David Rudisha yesterday. He told me just to take a rest and focus, and everything is possible.”\n\nChebet enjoys a close friendship with Kipyegon, who is six years her senior, but on the track she is not over-awed by one of the legends of athletics.\n\nIndeed Chebet has every chance of being accorded similar status, given her increasingly impressive gold medals tally.\n\nKipyegon, despite her disappointment at failing to repeat her world 1,500m/5000m double from the 2023 Budapest championships, embraced Chebet warmly at the finish.\n\n“Going home with two gold medals makes me really happy,” said Chebet.\n\n“Me and Faith have been friends for a long time. We motivate each other and I am really pleased with our performances.”\n\nKipyegon, who retained the 1,500m title earlier in the week, said Chebet “is the best”.\n\n“I’m now going to have some sleep and go back home and enjoy some time with my daughter,” she added.\n\nBATON FUMBLED\n\nThe USA men’s 4x100m relay teams have gained a reputation down the years for fouling up baton exchanges — the latest example came at the Olympics last year.\n\nThis time though it was not them but their great rivals Jamaica who came up short as Ryiem Forde’s handover to 100m silver medallist Kishane Thompson on the anchor leg went awry.\n\nThe two did not exchange a word as they walked the 90 metres or so to the line in a heat won by Olympic champions Canada.\n\nThe fumble also deprived world 100 metres gold medallist Oblique Seville of a tilt at a golden double.\n\nMeanwhile, Anna Hall exchanged world silver for gold in the heptathlon, but it was Kate O’Connor’s performance that caught the eye as the 24-year-old took silver, a first ever in the event for Ireland.\n\nIn fact, it was just Ireland’s seventh medal in championships history and their first since 2013.\n\n“I knew that I was always going to be in with a shot of a medal,” said the Northern Ireland-born O’Connor. “But it’s the one thing being in with a shot and another actually going out and doing it.”\n\nCaio Bonfim will be bringing a gold medal home to Brazil, winning the men’s 20km walk after finishing second in the 35km walk last Saturday.\n\nHowever, the 34-year-old will be returning home without one item he left Brazil with.\n\n“I lost my wedding ring in the third kilometre. I believe my wife will be OK because I won today,” he said.\n\nIn the women’s javelin event, Ecuador’s Juleisy Angulo surprised even herself by launching the javelin 65.12 metres with the second of her six attempts to clinch the gold.\n\nAngulo was ranked 31st in the world coming into the final and her winning throw beat her previous personal best by 1.87 metres.\n\n“My goal here was to reach the final so I am very emotional, in shock. I still can’t believe it,” the 24-year-old said.\n\n“I have dreamed of a world medal since I started athletics. I have faced some adversities, such as two surgeries in my left knee, but I persevered. I never gave up.”\n\nAngulo’s medal was a first at the world championships for Ecuador away from race-walking since Alex Quinonez won a bronze in the 200 metres six years ago in Doha.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 21st, 2025",
