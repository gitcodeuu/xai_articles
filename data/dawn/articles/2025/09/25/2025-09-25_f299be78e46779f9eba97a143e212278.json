Mustafizur has no idea where that pacy delivery went!\n\nCoach Hesson watches on intently.\n\n19.4: Rishad smacks Haris for six! Are we in for a surprise?!\n\nWasim bhai with a well done bhai in the commentary box\n\nPakistan are through to the final!\n\nHaris smacked a four and six in the final over, but that wasn’t enough for Bangladesh as Pakistan book their final date with archrivals India for the first time in the 17 editions of the Asia Cup.\n\nFaheem to bowl the penultimate over.\n\nA dejected Litton Das looks on at proceedings in despair.\n\n18.5: That would have been it for the Tigers, but Nawaz drops a dolly at long-on!\n\nTwo boundaries and a dropped catch, Faheem bowls a nervy over for Pakistan at a time when they are steps away from the finish line.\n\nHaris is down after a good start.\n\nLooks like he’s continuing his over after a stop in play. This would be a big blow if there were an injury to the express pacer.\n\n17.2: Haris strikes on his first ball back as he cleans up Tanzim!\n\n17.3: Taskin has no idea where that slower one by Haris ended up and somehow the ball goes past the boundary!\n\n17.4: Haris makes a mess of Taskin’s stumps!\n\nThe longest over of the match — thanks to Haris’ injury concern — sees Bangladesh ripped apart by the right-armer’s express pace.\n\nShaheen returns as Pakistan coach, Mike Hesson is out on the steps of the dressing room in anticipation.\n\nAnd the left-arm pacer does not disappoint him as he gets rid of Shamim.\n\nTanzim cracks Shaheen through the covers for four, but Shaheen responds with dangerman Shamim’s wicket as Pakistan inch closer to a famous win.\n\nOverheard in the newsroom: Remember the name; Shaheen Shah Afridi!\n\nFive off that Saim over.\n\nSaim completes his spell, conceding 16 across four overs as Shamim and Tanzim settle for five runs in the over.\n\nAbrar returns.\n\nA big over for Bangladesh against the run of play, and Shamim quietly prepares himself to go for the last-ditch attempt to save his team.\n\n13.5: Saim strikes by bowling wide, and the Bangladeshi skipper is gone!\n\nThe Tigers are in all sorts of trouble as Pakistan are in a strong position.\n\nNawaz continues to impress, conceding only four as the required run-rate exceeds nine per over.\n\nThe man with the golden arm strikes again!\n\nSaim returns to take another for Pakistan as Nasum departs to put Bangladesh under big pressure.\n\n10.2: Shamim is saved by a whisker as the review shows that the ball was hitting but impact was umpire’s call.\n\nNawaz keeps the Bangladesh batters guessing with the ball doing the talking on a tricky surface.\n\nMid-innings analysis: Pakistan’s bowlers have delivered so far, and they’re in a position they would’ve happily accepted after posting a low target. From Shaheen to Haris to Nawaz, they have been spot on. The required rate is rising for Bangladesh and Pakistan have a semblance of a grip on the match that they shouldn’t relinquish.\n\n9.4: Shamim sweeps Abrar for a six over square-leg!\n\nShamim Hossain counterattacks with a sweep for six off Abrar as Bangladesh look to push Pakistan off their backs.\n\nSaim bowls to Nurul.\n\nSaim comes into bowl as Pakistan look to make full use of the conditions at play and concedes only five in his first over.\n\nMohammad Nawaz into the attack!\n\n7.6: Nawaz strikes! Bangladesh are four down as Mahedi tries to find out if the cover fielder can catch or not?!\n\nNawaz shifts the match further into Pakistan’s favour as the ball is spinning miles!\n\n6.2: Abrar into the attack, and Nurul had no idea which way that one was turning!\n\nAbrar comes into the attack and delivers a decent over as the wicket shows encouraging signs for the spinners.\n\nHaris strikes to remove the dangerous-looking Saif!\n\nThe crowd is tilted in Bangladesh’s favour, and despite that, the noise in the ground goes through the roof!\n\nHaris gets the big one in Saif as Pakistan make huge inroads in a match which Bangladesh were expected to take away with ease. An edge flies off for six, but a confidence-boosting over for Salman and co.\n\n4.1: All sorts of drama to start the over! Pakistan and Bangladesh having a competition of who can miss the most chances in the field!\n\nSaim with a great diving stop, and Saif was gone for all money, had he hit!\n\nShaheen strikes again!\n\nHaris Rauf’s over has been expensive so far!\n\n3.6: Haris finally beats Saif, and Pakistan have taken a review.\n\nSaif milks Haris’s pace in the powerplay with a couple of solid shots for a six and four before Pakistan lose a review hoping the opener nicked one to the wicket-keeper.\n\nShaheen delivers another superb over as Bangladesh show restraint against Pakistan’s man in form.\n\nFaheem starts off with an expensive over.\n\nSaif Hasan reminds Pakistan that they have a giant to deal with if they are to create any chances for themselves in this match. The right-hander creams Faheem for Bangladesh’s first six in Faheem’s over.\n\nShaheen strikes!\n\n0.5: Yet another first over wicket for Shaheen as Parvez Hossain Emon departs while trying to hit one over deep-backwards square leg.\n\nWhat a start for Pakistan! Shaheen gets a wicket in the first over as Nawaz takes a good catch to send Parvez back to the pavilion.\n\nMid-innings analysis: Pakistan have a sub-par total on the board, and it makes you wonder why Salman was happy at losing the toss. Did the error occur in reading the pitch, or did the batters not apply themselves enough? To stay in the tournament, the onus is on the bowlers to find some inspiration.\n\nCan the Rana get Pakistan to any semblance of a good total?\n\n19.2: He starts off with a boundary to third-man!\n\nFaheem refuses a single as Haris looks on from the other end.\n\n18.1: Nawaz deposits Taskin into the stands!\n\n18.2: A slower one dismisses Nawaz as Bangladesh finally hang on to one!\n\nThe big-hitting Haris Rauf makes his way to the crease. Can he help the Green Shirts with a few lusty blows?\n\nNawaz also departs, trying to go for two sixes in a row off Taskin, but falling to a brilliant catch by Parvaiz Hussain Emon in the deep on the second attempt as 150 becomes almost impossible for Pakistan.\n\n17.1: Mahedi is smashed over the sight screen by Nawaz for a huge straight six!\n\nThe left-hander finished Pakistan’s previous match against Sri Lanka with 3 sixes and is continuing from where he left off!\n\n17.3: Haris departs as Mahedi takes one of his own bowling!\n\nFaheem is the next man in.\n\n16.2: Tanzim returns, and Haris tries to sweep the pacer for six! Moin Khan-esque!\n\n16.5: 100 up for Pakistan as Bangladesh continue to have a terrible day in the field!\n\nPakistan finally cross that mammoth 100-run mark as Haris survives a clear run-out chance thanks to poor decision making by Bangladesh in the field.\n\nMuztafizur returns.\n\n15.6: Haris laps Muztafizur for six! and Pakistan are nearly at six an over as the 16th over ends.\n\nThe Peshawar-born batter is fighting a lone battle here.\n\nHaris spoils Mustafizur’s over with a cheeky lap shot for six but there’s still a long way to go for Pakistan to post a target good enough for the bowlers to play with.\n\nHaris smacks Rishad for four!\n\nHaris welcomes Rishad back with a boundary, but Pakistan add only three runs other than that in the 15th, with the run-rate languishing below seven.\n\n13.1: A slower one by Taskin is smashed by Shaheen into the mid-wicket stands!\n\n13.3: Shaheen hit a full-toss straight-up, and the Bangladeshi skipper takes the catch himself.\n\n13.6: Yet another dropped catch by Bangladesh! Wonder what the situation would be if they actually held their catches?!\n\nNawaz gets off the mark with a boundary thanks to that horrendous fielding effort!\n\nAfter being gifted two lives, Shaheen goes for another big one, but this time Bangladesh captain Jaker Ali takes the catch as Pakistan go deeper in trouble.\n\n12.1: Haris faces Tanzim. Drives him for a single through the covers.\n\n12.3: Shaheen finally connects and the ball soars into the second tier!\n\nThat’s a 95m hit as calls of shooottt! go around in the newsroom!\n\n10 off the over as Shaheen makes it worth the price of admission.\n\nShaheen delivers the first six of Pakistan’s innings before flashing blindly against Tanzim and scampering through for a single.\n\n11.1: Rishad bowls to Shaheen, and the pinch-hitter gets dropped!\n\n11.2: Shaheen survives a lbw scare as the review shows the ball was hitting the stumps, but the umpire’s call saves him.\n\n11.3: Yet another chance as Shaheen is dropped at long-on, the left-arm pacer is in a hurry to head back to the dressing room!\n\nShaheen gifted with a couple of reprieves as Rishad returns. Pakistan would need a couple more, probably if they are to pose some sort of a challenge to Bangladesh.\n\nThe Fizz is back into the attack!\n\nAnd he strikes as the Pakistani skipper nicked one that came in by a whisker after pitching. Salman is gone after a successful Bangladesh review!\n\nShaheen is into the attack! But here he is with the bat at six down!\n\nMid-innings analysis by Umaid Wasim: Pakistan need to play out of their skins in the last 10 overs. The batters have succumbed to pressure, none of them able to apply themselves and play accordingly. Need Salman and Haris to stick together and take the team to a competitive total.\n\nMahedi returns.\n\n9.3: Welcome boundary for Pakistan! Haris tickles the loose delivery down the leg for a boundary!\n\nA paltry score at the halfway stage on a wicket that tends to cause problems to batters who go after it, Pakistan are only chasing the game from this point.\n\n8.1: Hussain departs as Rashid gets another wicket!\n\nRishad keeps Pakistan guessing with his deceptive bowling, send back Hussain Talat, thanks to another casual stroke and concedes only four runs.\n\nThe slingy Tanzim bowls to Pakistan’s player of the match from the Sri Lanka encounter, Hussain Talat.\n\nTanzim comes back and keeps Salman and Hussain quiet as the duo manage only four runs together.\n\nOverheard in the newsroom: Ye Tigers kon hai?\n\n6.3: Fakhar is gone! picked the long-off fielder to perfection!\n\nPakistan in absolute shambles by the end of the seventh after Fakhar falls to Rishad’s leg-spin, picking the fielder at long-off perfectly.\n\nMuztafizur Rahman is into the attack, the left-arm slingy pacer can trouble Pakistan further as they look to rebuild.\n\n5.5: The skipper gives the charge and hits it beautifully over the cover fielder for four!\n\nThe man under fire, Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha finally finds the rare boundary for Pakistan to cap an otherwise horrific powerplay.\n\nTanzim Hasan Saqib is into the attack for the Tigers.\n\nSix off the over after Fakhar got yet another boundary down to fine leg\n\nTanzim Hasan Sakib comes into the attack and carries on the momentum for Bangladesh as Pakistan try to find a way out from a poor start.\n\nMahedi returns after a successful first over.\n\n3.6: The skipper Salman Ali Agha ends the over with a statement of intent! The ball goes over the mid-off fielder for four.\n\nMahedi bowled another tidy over only for Salman to break the shackles on the last ball, lifting him for a welcome boundary on the last ball.\n\nTaskin returns as the decibels in the stadium go up.\n\n2.5: Fakhar gives Taskin the charge and gets a lucky boundary off an edge!\n\nTaskin showing Bangladesh what they were missing last night. A superb first over backed up by another good one. He was unlucky when Fakhar’s bottom edge raced to the fence The pressure is on Pakistan.\n\nMahedi Hasan is into the attack.\n\n1.4: Saim hits the ball straight to mid on, and he has gotten his fourth duck in this Asia Cup.\n\nBangladesh set the trap, and Saim happily falls into it. Mahedi and co are on top in Dubai, and Pakistan are reeling.\n\nPakistan openers Fakhar Zaman and Sahibzada Farhan out in the middle; Taskin Ahmed, who sat out Wednesday’s game against India to open the bowling\n\n0.3: Sahibzada smacks that off the back foot for the first boundary of the innings!\n\n0.4: And the right-handed opener is gone!\n\nAn in-form Sahibzada becomes the prey of his own confidence. Going after a full one but hitting it too casually to elude the fielder at point. Not a good start for Pakistan.\n\nThe Bangladeshi anthem is being played first.\n\nThe Pakistani anthem follows.\n\nThe fans are showing up for the all-important encounter of the men’s Asia Cup.\n\nPakistan: Sahibzada Farhan, Fakhar Zaman, Saim Ayub, Salman Ali Agha (captain), Hussain Talat, Mohammad Haris, Mohammad Nawaz, Faheem Ashraf, Shaheen Shah Afridi, Haris Rauf, and Abrar Ahmed.\n\nBangladesh: Parvez Hossain Emon, Saif Hassan, Towhid Hridoy, Shamim Hossain, Jaker Ali (captain), Rishad Hossain, Nurul Hasan, Mahedi Hasan, Tanzim Hasan Saqib, Taskin Ahmed, and Muztafizur Rahman.",
