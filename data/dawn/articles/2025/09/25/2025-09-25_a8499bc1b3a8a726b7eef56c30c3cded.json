No report was submitted on behalf of the Additional Advocate General.\n\nThe court noted that Qesco officials were disconnecting household connections attached to tube wells without notice, causing severe hardship for farmers. It observed that widespread power loadshedding was disrupting education, office and business activities.\n\nDetailed report sought\n\nSubsequently, the court directed the three officials to appear in person at the next hearing on Oct 7 and submit detailed replies.\n\nAdditionally, the bench expressed strong displeasure over traffic disruptions at Lakpass Tunnel and sought a detailed report from relevant authorities.\n\nThe court declared a report from the Deputy Commissioner of Mastung “unsatisfactory” and ordered him to appear at the next hearing with a comprehensive plan to improve traffic flow.\n\nThe bench remarked that criminal activities and public problems around the tunnel have been rising for the past year.\n\nDespite repeated calls, the petitioner’s lawyer did not appear, however, according to the petition, Levies, Customs, and FC North posts at the tunnel, which connects Quetta with several districts, often cause vehicles to be “stuck for hours”.\n\nThe court directed the Deputy Attorney General and FC North’s counsel to explain at the next hearing why the check points had not been shifted to a more suitable location.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 25th, 2025",
