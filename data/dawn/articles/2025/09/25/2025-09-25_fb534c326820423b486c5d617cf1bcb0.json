He stated they were not closing waterways but were reinforcing points where the speed of the water could cause damage.\n\nMr Nawaz said he did not have equipment to measure if water levels were rising and that controlling the inflow was the irrigation department’s responsibility.\n\nFlooding in Jamshoro\n\nAccording to authorities in Sindh, a medium-level flood that is moving through the Indus, has submerged vast tracts of agricultural land and dozens of villages. The flow at Kotri Barrage is around 400,000 cusecs, leaving most low-lying areas between Sehwan, Jamshoro and Kotri inundated.\n\nThe towns of Kotri, Khanpur, and Karoon Khu remain safe for now. However, in Petaro, UCs Manzoorabad and Moro Jabal are submerged. In the Manjhand area, villages including Aliabad, Khanot, Indpur, and Budhapur are affected. Over 20 rural settlements in the floodplain are now underwater, forcing residents to evacuate to safer locations on their own.\n\nFlooding has cut off land routes to many villages from Sehwan and Bhan Saeedabad.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 25th, 2025",
