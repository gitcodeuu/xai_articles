We don’t stay inside the house and we sleep in the garden, constantly thinking there will be another quake,” she said.\n\nSimilar scenes are playing out across the affected region, some in the isolated areas of hard-hit Kunar province that are still cut off from aid by landslides caused by the quake and aftershocks.\n\nBut in fleeing their homes — often built on high ground — and taking refuge in low-lying fields, riverbeds or by roadsides, survivors risk being hit by rockfall if aftershocks strike, warned Ijaz Ulhaq Yaad, a senior official in Kunar’s Nurgal district.\n\n“The area is very dangerous, you cannot stay there long or even walk through it,” Yaad said.\n\nThe United Nations said it has 14,000 tents ready for distribution.\n\nThe International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) told AFP it has at least 700 tents available, but cannot deliver them to survivors because of difficult access to the villages.\n\n“Help us, give us shelter, help my children, we have nothing left,” pleaded Sorat, a housewife injured in the quake along with her husband and children.\n\nAfter being pulled from the ruins of her house by rescuers, she was treated in a regional hospital, then sent back to her village, where nothing awaits her, she told AFP.\n\nWhile waiting for aid, “we are staying in the valley”, she said, sitting in her blue all-enveloping burqa on a traditional, simple woven bed surrounded by her three small children.\n\nThis earthquake, one of the deadliest in Afghanistan in decades, is “the last thing families with young children need in a country where many don’t have enough food, and a large portion of the children are already malnourished”, the World Food Programme said, adding the situation “is brutal”.\n\nAfghanistan, still fragile after decades of war and a prolonged humanitarian crisis, has been rocked by other severe, deadly quakes in recent years —one in 2023 in western Herat, on the other side of the country near Iran.\n\nThat first 6.3-magnitude tremor was followed by at least eight powerful aftershocks and destroyed entire villages.\n\nHeader Image: Afghan boys sit on the rubble of a house following a deadly magnitude-6 earthquake that struck Afghanistan on Sunday in Nurgal district, Kunar province of the country, on September 3. — Reuters",
