While many countries have bolstered their mental health policies and programmes, greater investment and action are needed globally to expand services to prote­­ct and promote people’s mental well-being.\n\nMental health conditions such as anxiety and depression are highly prevalent in all countries and communities, affecting people of every age and income level. They are the second leading cause of long-term disability, contributing significantly to the loss of healthy life. They drive up healthcare costs for affected people and families, while inflicting substantial economic losses on a global scale.\n\nMeanwhile, the new findings published in two reports — World Mental Health Today and Mental Health Atlas 2024 — highlight some areas of progress while exposing significant gaps in addressing mental health conditions worldwide.\n\nThese reports serve as critical tools to inform national strategies and shape global dialogue ahead of the 2025 United Nations High-Level Meeting on noncommunicable diseases and the promotion of mental health and well-being, scheduled for September 25 in New York.\n\n“Transforming mental health services is one of the most pressing public health challenges,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebre­yesus, WHO Director-General. “Investing in mental health means investing in people, communities, and economies — an investment no country can afford to neglect.\n\nEvery government and every leader has a responsibility to act with urgency and to ensure that mental healthcare is treated not as a privilege, but as a basic right for all.”\n\nKey data\n\nThe reports show that while prevalence of mental health disorders can vary by sex, women are disproportionately impacted overall. Anxiety and depression are the most common types of mental health disorders among both men and women.\n\nSuicide remains a devastating outcome, claiming an estimated 727,000 lives in 2021 alone. It is a leading cause of death among young people in all countries and across socioeconomic groups.\n\nDespite global efforts, progress in reducing suicide mortality is too low to achieve the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target of a one-third reduction in suicide rates by 2030. On the current trajectory, only a 12 per cent reduction will be achieved by that deadline.\n\nThe economic impact of mental health disorders is staggering. While healthcare costs are high, the indirect costs — particularly from lost productivity — are even greater. Depression and anxiety alone cost the global economy an estimated $1 trillion each year.\n\nThe reports reveal a concerning stagnation in mental health investment. Median government spending on mental health remains at just 2pc of total health budgets — unchanged since 2017. Disparities between countries are stark; while high-income countries spend up to $65 per person on mental health, low-income countries spend as little as $0.04. The global median number of mental health workers is only 13 per 100, 000 people, with extreme shortages in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nReform and development of mental health services are progressing slowly. Fewer than 10pc of countries have fully transitioned to community-based care models, with most still in the early stages of transition.\n\nEncouragingly, most countries report having functional mental health promotion initiatives such as early childhood development, school-based mental health programmes and suicide prevention strategies.\n\nOver 80pc of countries now offer mental health and psychosocial support as part of emergency responses.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 3rd, 2025",
