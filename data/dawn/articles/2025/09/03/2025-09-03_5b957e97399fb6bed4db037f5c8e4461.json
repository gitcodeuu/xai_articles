Kidnappings for ransom, extortion rackets, brutal killings and robberies on major highways occur on a daily basis.\n\nIn a post on X, the Punjab Police said that “an operation against dacoit hideouts was carried out in Rahim Yar Khan’s Kacha Ronti, using drones”.\n\n“The operation left multiple dacoits injured,” the statement added.\n\nPunjab Inspector General of Police Dr Usman Anwar commended the efforts of the police and was quoted as saying, “Punjab Police is fully utilising drone technology not only to assist flood-affected people but also to eliminate criminal elements.”\n\nOn August 1, five cops were martyred after bandits of the Katcha area attacked a police checkpoint in Rahim Yar Khan.\n\nIn March, three people were allegedly shot dead by dacoits in the Jamaldin Wali area of tehsil Sadiqabad near the Indus River, to avenge the murder of a YouTuber.",
