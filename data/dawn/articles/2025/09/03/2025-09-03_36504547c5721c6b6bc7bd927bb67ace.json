The departure ceremony of the supplies was held at the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) warehouse in Islamabad, PTV News reported.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Minister of State for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Kheal Das Kohistani, along with officials from the NDMA and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\n\nThis was the third major earthquake since the Taliban took power in 2021, but there are even fewer resources for the cash-strapped government’s response after the United States slashed assistance to the country when President Donald Trump took office in January.\n\nEven before the earthquake, the United Nations estimated it had obtained less than a third of the funding required for operations countrywide.\n\nRescue teams struggled to reach survivors as night approached days after the powerful earthquake in eastern Afghanistan, as access to remote areas remained obstructed.\n\nFearful of the near-constant aftershocks rattling the area, people huddled in the open air while others struggled to unearth those trapped under the heaps of flattened buildings.\n\nAccess remained difficult, as aftershocks caused rockfall, stymying access to already isolated villages and keeping families huddled outdoors for fear of the remains of damaged homes collapsing on them.\n\n“Everyone is afraid and there are many aftershocks,” Awrangzeeb Noori, 35, told AFP from the village of Dara-i-Nur in Nangarhar province. “We spend all day and night in the field without shelter.”\n\nThe non-governmental group Save the Children said one of its aid teams “had to walk for 20 kilometres to reach villages cut off by rock falls, carrying medical equipment on their backs with the help of community members”.\n\nThe World Food Programme (WFP) shared images of teams hiking up slopes carrying boxes of food aid on their shoulders.\n\nThe Taliban government deputy spokesperson, Hamdullah Fitrat, told AFP that areas that had taken days to reach had been finally accessed.\n\n“We cannot determine the date for finishing the operation in all areas as the area is very mountainous and it is very difficult to reach every area.”\n\nMore than 12,000 people have been directly affected by the earthquake, according to ActionAid, noting women and girls were particularly vulnerable in emergencies as they face steep restrictions under the Taliban authorities.\n\nResidents of Jalalabad, the nearest city to the quake epicentre, donated money and goods such as blankets to be delivered to those impacted by the quake.\n\n“I am a simple labourer and I came here to help the earthquake victims because I felt very sad for them,” said resident Mohammad Rahman.\n\n“If I could do more, I would help even more, but I helped with what I had.”\n\nAfghanistan also airdropped commandos to pull survivors from the rubble in areas ravaged by earthquakes, as a UN agency warned that food aid for victims would run out soon without urgent funding.\n\nDozens of commando forces were being airdropped at sites where helicopters cannot land, to help carry the injured to safer ground, in what aid groups said was a race against time to rescue those still stuck under rubble.\n\nTime was also running out for those who survived the two devastating quakes in the remote eastern region of the impoverished country, the WFP warned today.\n\nJohn Aylieff, the head of WFP in Afghanistan, told Reuters that the agency only has enough funding and stocks for the next four weeks.\n\n“Four weeks is just not enough even to meet the basic, essential needs of the population struck by the earthquake, let alone put the victims on a path back to rebuilding their lives,” Aylieff said.\n\nWFP funding for Afghanistan this year is just under $300 million, according to UN financial data, down from $1.7 billion in 2022, the first full year the country was ruled by the Taliban.\n\nResources for rescue and relief work are tight in the nation of 42 million people hit by war, poverty and shrinking aid. It has received limited global help after the disaster.",
