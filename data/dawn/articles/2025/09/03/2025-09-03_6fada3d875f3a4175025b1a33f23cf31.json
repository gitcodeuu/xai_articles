  "content": "LAHORE: An anti-terrorism court (ATC) on Tuesday again granted the prosecution time to produce the case record in the Jinnah House attack in connection with post-arrest bail petition of Shershah Khan, a nephew of incarcerated PTI founding chairman Imran Khan.\n\nATC-I Judge Manzer Ali Gill resumed the hearing of the bail matter, however, once again the record of the case was not presented by the prosecution.\n\nA prosecutor stated that the record had been submitted to the Lahore High Court, therefore, more time was required to produce it. Shershah’s counsel opposed the prosecution’s request, saying the non-production of the record was a delaying tactic.\n\nIn response to the court’s query, the prosecutor said two to three days were required to present the record.\n\nThe judge allowed time for the record to be produced and adjourned further proceedings till Sept 4.\n\nDuring the hearing, Shershah’s father Amir Sohail Khan was also present.\n\nIn his bail plea, Shershah contended that he had been implicated in the case on political grounds.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 3rd, 2025",
