  "content": "SHARJAH: Afghanistan put on a commanding all-round display to seal an 18-run victory over Pakistan in their tri-nation series Twenty20 International on Tuesday, notching their second victory in two days.\n\nAfter posting a competitive 169-5, Afghanistan — who beat the United Arab Emirates on Monday — restricted Pakistan to 151-9 with disciplined bowling and sharp fielding.\n\nPakistan had beaten Afghanistan in the tri-series opener on Friday but were second best this time.\n\nThey faltered at regular intervals in their chase with early strikes from Fazalhaq Farooqi (2-21) removing openers Sahibzada Farhan (18) and Saim Ayub, before Fakhar Zaman’s 25 kept the innings afloat.\n\nBut the middle order failed to capitalise with Salman Agha (20), Hasan Nawaz (nine), and Mohammad Nawaz (12) all going cheaply.\n\nRashid Khan (2-30) and Noor Ahmad (2-20) tightened the screws in middle overs, while experienced Mohammad Nabi (2-20) dismissed key batters.\n\nPakistan slumped to 111-9 in the 17th over, before Haris Rauf’s blistering 34 not out off 16 balls offered late fireworks.\n\nEarlier, Afghanistan’s top order flourished through a superb partnership between Sediqullah Atal (64 off 45) and Ibrahim Zadran (65 off 45) despite the early loss of opener Rahmanullah Gurbaz.\n\nThe duo stitched together 113 runs for the second wicket, setting a strong foundation. Despite a late wobble caused by Faheem Ashraf (4-27), Afghanistan eventually had enough on the board and joined Pakistan with two wins from three matches.\n\n“I think 170 was gettable,” rued Pakistan skipper Salman. “I thought the bowlers did a good job. We lost too many wickets in the middle overs. After eight overs, we were going well but we lost many wickets.\n\n“When you lose that many wickets, it becomes very difficult. The Afgha­nistan spinners are quality spinners. If you give any sniff to them, they are good enough to grab it. If we did not lose that many wickets in the middle overs, it could have been a different story.”\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nAFGHANISTAN:\n\nRahmanullah Gurbaz c Hasan b Saim 8\n\nSediqullah Atal c Hasan b Faheem 64\n\nIbrahim Zadran c Nawaz b Faheem 65\n\nAzmatullah Omarzai c&b Faheem 4\n\nKarim Janat not out 8\n\nMohammad Nabi c Fakhar b Faheem 6\n\nRashid Khan not out 8\n\nEXTRAS (LB-2, W-4) 6\n\nTOTAL (for five wickets, 20 overs) 169\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-10 (Gurbaz), 2-123 (Atal), 3-145 (Omarzai), 4-146 (Zadran), 5-161 (Nabi)\n\nDID NOT BAT: Darwish Rasooli, Allah Mohammad Ghazanfar, Noor Ahmed, Fazalhaq Farooqi\n\nBOWLING: Shaheen 4-0-27-0 (2w), Saim 4-0-18-1, Haris Rauf 3-0-38-0 (2w), Nawaz 2-0-24-0, Sufiyan 3-0-33-0, Faheem 4-0-27-4\n\nPAKISTAN:\n\nSahibzada Farhan b Farooqi 18\n\nSaim Ayub c Gurbaz b Farooqi 0\n\nFakhar Zaman c Farooqi b Nabi 25\n\nSalman Ali Agha run out 20\n\nHasan Nawaz c Janat b Noor 9\n\nMohammad Nawaz c Sediqullah b Rashid 12\n\nMohammad Haris c Rasooli b Nabi 1\n\nFaheem Ashraf b Noor 14\n\nShaheen Shah Afridi b Rashid 0\n\nHaris Rauf not out 34\n\nSufiyan Muqeem not out 7\n\nEXTRAS (B-4, LB-2, W-5) 11\n\nTOTAL (for nine wickets, 20 overs) 151\n\nFALL OF WICKETS: 1-8 (Saim), 2-29 (Sahibzada), 3-62 (Fakhar), 4-67 (Salman), 5-75 (Hasan), 6-82 (Mohammad Haris), 7-103 (Nawaz), 8-103 (Shaheen), 9-111 (Faheem)\n\nBOWLING: Ghazanfar 3-0-24-0, Farooqi 3-0-21-2 (1w), Omarzai 2-0-30-0, Rashid 4-0-30-2, Nabi 4-0-20-2 (1w), Noor 4-0-20-2 (2w)\n\nRESULT: Afghanistan won by 18 runs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 3rd, 2025",
