However, they said that in order to resolve the water issue and improving cleanliness, joint efforts were needed as without public support, issues could not be resolved. They said the public awareness was very important and the masses must understand their responsibilities.\n\nThey said the government is committed to improving cleanliness and providing people with all facilities in the provincial capital through public-private partnerships and adopting modern technology. In this regard, they said an app is being developed to enhance public service delivery.\n\nThe President of Quetta Press Club, Irfan Saeed, and other journalists pointed out issues being faced by the people of the provincial capital.\n\nThe Quetta division commissioner said the people must realise their responsibility to safeguard public institutions and support positive initiatives of the government. He said a waste treatment plant has been made functional and efforts are being made to ensure transparency through digitalisation.\n\nMr Kakar said that measures are being taken to address city’s issues of cleanliness, parking, road expansion, drinking water issue, plantation and traffic management. He said that drug addicts are being provided treatment and rehabilitation to reintegrate them as productive members of society. He said that no-parking issue has been resolved and a comprehensive strategy is in place to tackle urban challenges.\n\n“No one will be allowed to violate the law. Anyone attempting to flout or manipulate the law will face legal action,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 26th, 2025",
