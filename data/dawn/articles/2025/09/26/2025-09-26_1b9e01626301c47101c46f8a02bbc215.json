Trump has 15 million followers on his personal TikTok account. The White House also launched an official TikTok account last month.\n\n“This is going to be American-operated all the way,” Trump said. He said that Michael Dell, the founder, chairman and CEO of Dell Technologies; Rupert Murdoch, the chairman emeritus of Fox News owner Fox Corp and newspaper publisher News Corp, and “probably four or five absolutely world-class investors” would be part of the deal.\n\nThe White House did not discuss how it came up with the $14 billion valuation.\n\nTikTok’s Chinese parent, ByteDance, currently values itself at more than $330 billion, according to its new employee share buyback plan. TikTok contributes a small percentage of the company’s total revenue.\n\nAccording to Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, TikTok was estimated to be worth $30 billion to $40bn without the algorithm as of April 2025.\n\nAlan Rozenshtein, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said the executive order left unanswered questions, including whether ByteDance would still control the algorithm.\n\n“The problem is that the president has certified the deal, but he has not provided a lot of information on the algorithm,” he said.\n\nChinese media on Friday also painted a different picture of the TikTok agreement, suggesting ByteDance would continue to play a major or operational role.\n\nByteDance will set up a new US company as part of the restructuring of TikTok’s US operations, Chinese media outlet LatePost reported, citing sources.\n\nThe new company to be set up by ByteDance will be responsible for e-commerce, branding operations and interconnection with international operations, the report said.\n\nThe report also said the joint venture, as described by the White House and valued at $14 billion, would be responsible for US digital security, safeguarding content and software as well as related local businesses.\n\nAnother Chinese financial magazine, Caixin, also reported, citing people close to the deal, that ByteDance planned to set up a TikTok US entity that will receive some revenue from the new TikTok joint venture.\n\nBoth reports were taken down from their respective websites later on Friday. The White House and ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nA group of three investors, including Oracle and private-equity firm Silver Lake, will take a roughly 50 per cent stake in TikTok US, two sources familiar with the deal said on Thursday.\n\nA group of existing shareholders in ByteDance will hold a roughly 30pc stake, one of the sources said. Among ByteDance’s current investors are Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic and KKR.\n\nGiven intense investor interest in TikTok, the 50pc stake may still shift, the source noted.\n\nOracle and Silver Lake did not immediately respond to requests for comment. CNBC reported earlier, citing sources, that Abu Dhabi-based MGX, Oracle and Silver Lake are poised to be the main investors in TikTok US with a combined 45pc ownership.\n\nMGX did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on the CNBC report.\n\nRepublican House of Representatives lawmakers said they wanted to see more details of the deal to ensure it represented a clean break with China.\n\n“As the details are finalised, we must ensure this deal protects American users from the influence and surveillance of CCP-aligned groups,” said US Representatives Brett Guthrie, Gus Bilirakis and Richard Hudson.\n\nThe agreement on TikTok’s US operations includes the appointment by ByteDance of one of seven board members for the new entity, with Americans holding the other six seats, a senior White House official said on Saturday.\n\nByteDance would hold less than 20pc in TikTok US to comply with requirements set out in the 2024 law that ordered it shut down by January 2025 if ByteDance did not sell its US assets.",
