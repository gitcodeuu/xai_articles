After Shaheen dismantled Bangladesh’s powerplay, Haris arrived later on to finish the job, and made impact with the wicket of Saif Hassan, Bangladesh’s most dangerous batter in the tournament.\n\nThere was calculated aggression on display from the duo, who mixed up hitting hard lengths with searing yorkers and deceptive slower ones to shine in the wickets columns and given their form, Shaheen and Haris could show up as box office items in the final.\n\nAlthough Pakistan were clinical with the ball, they struggled big time with the bat, regardless that it was a tricky surface to play on. It was expected from Pakistan’s top-three to build onto their decent shows against India the last time the side played in Dubai, but both failed miserably against Bangladesh.\n\nSahibzada Farhan seemed in touch when he cracked a backfoot cover drive early on but how he casually drove the next ball into the fielder’s hands was poor decision-making from the right-hander.\n\nFakhar Zaman, meanwhile, looked clueless against the Bangladesh spin attack before departing cheaply. And Saim Ayub added a ninth duck to his T20 career stats trying to pick the wrong delivery up over the infield. Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha’s poor run in the Asia Cup continued as his credentials as a T20 batter were questioned once again, while Hussain Talat was also dismissed on a loose delivery.\n\nHad it not been a lower-order flourish, ignited by Shaheen’s 13 off 19 — which included two massive sixes — and marshalled by Mohammad Haris, who stuck around to add a 23-ball 31 before Mohammad Nawaz smashed 25 off 15 (a four and two sixes), Pakistan wouldn’t have been able to cross even the 100-mark.\n\nThe effort deep into the innings, infact, saw Pakistan add 80 off the last eight over after having reeling at 49-5 by the end of the 11th over. Despite the top-ordee failure, the lower-order’s utility came in handy for Pakistan, which is a huge confidence-boostimg point ahead of a clash which would require heaps of it.\n\nBangladesh, for their part, were ordinary. Chasing 136, they never found rhythm. Regular wickets crippled their response, with Shamim Hossain’s 30 the only notable resistance. Saif Hassan briefly threatened before Haris accounted for him, and the rest folded without offering a fight.\n\nCrucially, Bangladesh also let Pakistan off the hook in the field, spilling chances that could have swung momentum. In a game decided by slim margins, such sloppiness proved costly.\n\nPakistan’s spinners also deserve credit for applying the brakes. Saim Ayub’s tidy spell of 2-16 kept Bangladesh on the leash, while Nawaz bowled with control to choke the middle overs. It was the kind of collective effort that ensured the pace bowlers’ early breakthroughs did not go to waste.\n\nFor Bangladesh, the failure to chase down a modest target underlines a gulf in execution. For Pakistan, the win reinforces the formula that has carried them so far: pace potency, lower-order grit and just enough from the rest. But against India in a final, where mistakes are punished ruthlessly, more will be needed.\n\nHeader Image: Haris Rauf celebrates after dismissing Bangladesh’s Tanzim Hasan Sakib during the Asia Cup 2025 Super Four Twenty20 international cricket match at the Dubai International Stadium in Dubai on September 25.",
