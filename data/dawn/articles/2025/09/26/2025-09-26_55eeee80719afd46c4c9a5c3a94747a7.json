I think there will be a lot of questions raised,” he said.\n\nAndy Herries, an archeologist at La Trobe University, said he was not convinced by the conclusions and that genetic analysis had shown fossil morphology, or shape, was “not always a perfect indicator for human evolution”.\n\n“They’ve got this interpretation that I just don’t really think is taking into account the genetic histories of these things that we do know,” he told AFP.\n\nThe findings are only the latest in a string of recent research that has complicated what we thought we knew about our origins.\n\nHomo longi, also known as “Dragon Man”, was itself only named as a new species and close human relative in 2021, by a team that included Stringer.\n\nThe authors said their work illustrates the complexity of our shared history.\n\n“Fossils like Yunxian 2 show just how much we still have to learn about our origins,” said Stringer.",
