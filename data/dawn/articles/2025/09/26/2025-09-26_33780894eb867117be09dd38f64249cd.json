He also said that police stations where no blind murder case was reported should submit a clearance certificate.\n\nEarlier, the Punjab Police Monitoring Cell had sought a complete record of all cases of blind murders of women, unidentified women’s bodies discovered in canals or elsewhere, attempted suicides or suicides of women, and cases investigated under Section 174 CrPC that occurred across Punjab between 2019 and September 2025.\n\nAccording to sources, the in-charge investigators of all Punjab police, including Rawalpindi, have been asked to appear before the Additional Inspector General Monitoring Punjab with the records of all registered cases.\n\nThe Additional IG Monitoring Punjab also issued a letter titled, “Appearance of In-charge Investigation” to the district police officers of all Punjab, including Lahore and Rawalpindi.\n\nThe letter said the competent authority had ordered all in-charge investigators to appear with complete records and details of blind murder cases of women or murders where the deceased women were unidentified, including incidents where women’s bodies were found in canals or other places.\n\nDetails were also sought about unidentified women’s bodies and cases involving attempted or committed suicides of women, or cases registered under Section 174 CrPC that remained under investigation.\n\nIn addition, all FIRs and related reports, along with the complete district records, were to be presented at the office of the Additional IG Monitoring Punjab in Lahore.\n\nPolice sources said the purpose of summoning the records and investigators was to review progress in such cases involving women and to formulate a strategy for investigating these untraced cases, including improving the overall investigation system.\n\nAccording to law experts, Section 174 CrPC mandates police inquiries into unnatural deaths such as suicides or accidental deaths, to investigate and report the apparent cause of death.\n\nThe inquiry covers suicides, deaths by animals or machinery, accidental deaths, or deaths under circumstances that raise suspicion of an offence.\n\nThe Rawalpindi police have already submitted details of blind murder cases of women registered between 2019 and September 15, 2025.\n\nFour such cases, registered with Saddar Beroni, Rawat and Jatli police stations, remain untraced.\n\nSimilarly, two cases of unidentified women’s bodies recovered from canals or other places were reported at Rawat Police Station, Rawalpindi, during this period. These cases also remain untraced.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 26th, 2025",
