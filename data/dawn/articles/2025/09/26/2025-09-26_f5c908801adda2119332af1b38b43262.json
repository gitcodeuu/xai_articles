  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is exploring plans to establish a 57-80 horsepower Belarus tractor assembly line to support the country’s agricultural sector, officials said on Thursday.\n\nSpecial Assistant to the Prime Minister on Industries and Production Haroon Akhtar Khan chaired a high-level meeting with private tractor investors, Margalla Heavy Industries Ltd, Heavy Industries Taxila, and Green Corporate Initiatives to discuss the initiative.\n\nAn agreement with Belarus, Mr Khan said, would boost agriculture and increase productivity by enabling local assembly of high-horsepower tractors through a completely knocked down (CKD) plant.\n\nSources estimate a market potential of 2,800 tractor units over the next five years. Some investors have already shown interest in the Belarus tractors, and the minister encouraged more private-sector participation.\n\nHe added that strengthening business-to-business ties between Pakistan and Belarus in tractor assembly could have a transformative impact on the sector.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 26th, 2025",
