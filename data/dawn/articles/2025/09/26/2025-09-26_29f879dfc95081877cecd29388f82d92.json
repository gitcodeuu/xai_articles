Barrister Salman Safdar contended that the court had been approached on multiple occasi­ons without any disruption.\n\nResponding to the grievances, CJ Dogar apologised to the defence counsel and assured them that the court would not allow such obstacles in the fut­ure. “This is your court, come whenever you want,” he remarked, instructing the auth­orities to ensure smooth access for legal representatives and litigants.\n\nNAB prosecutor Rafay Maqsood then infor­med the bench that the special prosecutor in the case was seriously ill and unable to appear. This led Barrister Safdar to accuse NAB of deliberately employing delaying tactics.\n\nMedia talk\n\nSpeaking to the media after the hearing, PTI founder Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan said the Toshakhana-2 case was being heard in Adi­a­­la Jail and, according to lawyer Salman Saf­d­­ar, the matter would be decided in two or three hearings and Imran Khan would be punished.\n\n“On the other hand, for the last 10 months we have been trying to get a hearing date from the Islamabad High Court. After sitting for hours in Justice Dogar’s secretary’s room, we obtained a date of Sept 25 and now the next date has been fixed for Oct 16. While the cipher case was being heard by the IHC, it was listed daily. Now why are such long intervals being given? Is the case being delayed so that the Toshakhana-2 case can be decided?” she asked.\n\nShe claimed it was obvious the judge was deliberately delaying the matter, since a date in first week of October could have been given.\n\n“Imran also said that Gen Asim Munir cannot stop him from posting on social media. He said the account belongs to him and he will not be dictated to by Asim Munir,” Ms Khan said.\n\nOn the occasion, KP CM Gandapur alleged that the actions in Imran Khan’s case were pre-planned.\n\nIkram Junaidi also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 26th, 2025",
