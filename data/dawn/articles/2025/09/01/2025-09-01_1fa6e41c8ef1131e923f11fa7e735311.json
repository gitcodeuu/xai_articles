It accused Ducky Bhai of promoting different gambling and betting applications, including 1xBet, Bet 365, B9 Game and Binomo — for which he is charged with acting as country manager — through his YouTube channel.\n\nMonday’s hearing in the court of Magistrate Muhammad Naeem Wattoo came after the completion of the YouTuber’s four-day remand, which had been granted on August 28. The investigating officer requested an extension, citing a forensic analysis report of the electronic devices seized from Ducky Bhai’s possession. The officer said there were several chats on the suspect’s device relating to the promotion of gambling apps, alongside evidence of foreign transactions.\n\nDucky Bhai’s lawyer, Advocate Chaudhry Usman Ali, asked the court not to grant an extension in his client’s remand, saying the details of banking transactions can be obtained without keeping the accused in custody. He also argued that the NCCIA had yet to present any evidence proving that the YouTuber was the country manager for Binomo or that the companies he promoted caused financial losses to their users.\n\nDirecting the agency to conclude the investigation, the court granted the agency a two-day extension in Rehman’s remand and asked the NCCIA to present the accused in court on September 3.",
