He said the evacuation had been going on for the last one month. He added that only male members of families were now staying there.\n\nHe stated that around 29,000 livestock, i.e. 99pc of the total, had also been shifted to safe places during this period. This riverine belt runs along Sadhiyon-Matiari bund in the 49-mile-long river bank between Saeedabad and Matiari.\n\nStrengthening of weak dykes almost complete, say officials\n\nLarkana Deputy Commissioner Sharjeel Noor Channa along with Sindh Rangers’ Wing Commander Ziaur Rehman visited the Moria Loop Bund on Sunday to assess its strength.

He assured the rescue teams that Rangers would provide necessary security to them in the riverine (katcha) areas.\n\nAt the points of direct river strike at Moria Loop Bund, a special protective (hockey shaped) spur was being constructed which will be completed within a day or two, while stone pitching to strengthening the embankment was also under way, said the DC.\n\n“The first priority of the Sindh government is to ensure protection of people’s life and property,” he said.\n\nAs per the chief minister’s directives, work for the taluka-wise relocation of villagers in the riverine belt was being carried out, he said, adding that health camps for people and their livestock had been set up which were now functional.
