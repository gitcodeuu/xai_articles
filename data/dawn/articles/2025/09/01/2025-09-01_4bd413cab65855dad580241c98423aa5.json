This system, combined with a westerly wave, is expected to persist until Monday.\n\nWind and thunderstorms are expected in Kashmir, GB, KP and upper and southern Punjab, as well as Islamabad. Meanwhile, isolated heavy rainfall is anticipated in Kashmir, upper KP, and northeastern and southern Punjab.\n\nOther regions of the country are likely to experience hot and dry conditions.\n\nThe department warned that on Sept 1, heavy rainfall may generate flash floods in the local streams of Dir, Swat, Shangla, Buner, Kohistan, Manshera, Abbottabad, Nowshera and Swabi.\n\nThe risk also extends to Murree, Galliyat, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, northeast Punjab and the hill torrents of Dera Ghazi Khan.\n\nHeavy downpours could also cause urban flooding in low-lying areas of Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Lahore, Sialkot, Narowal, Peshawar, Nowshera and Mardan.\n\nOfficials warned that landslides and mudslides may lead to road closures in vulnerable hilly areas of KP, Murree, Galliyat and Kashmir during the forecast period.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 1st, 2025",
