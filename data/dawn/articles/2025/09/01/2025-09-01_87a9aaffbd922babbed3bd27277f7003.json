  "content": "HARARE: A Pathum Nissanka century set up Sri Lanka for a five-wicket One-day International win over Zimbabwe in Harare on Sunday with three balls to spare, and a 2-0 series victory.\n\nThe 27-year-old right-hand opener claimed his seventh ODI ton by making 122 off 136 balls. His knock including 16 fours.\n\nHe put on 90 runs for the fourth wicket with captain Charith Asalanka (71), taking the tourists to 236-4 with 33 balls remaining.\n\nReplying to a Zimbabwe total of 277-7 off 50 overs, Sri Lanka reached 278-5 to seal a second straight ODI series victory after a 2-1 win over Bangladesh.\n\nThe Nissanka ton, coupled with his 76 runs in a thrilling seven-run first ODI win on Friday, earned him the player-of-the-series award.\n\n“It has been a little while since I have been among the runs in One-day Internationals, so I am glad I was able to score some here,” said Nissanka.\n\n“I wanted to do well for the team and I trusted myself. It was tougher to bat during the powerplay and the Zimbabwe bowlers performed well.”\n\nZimbabwe captain Sean Williams (20) had regrets: “The series could have gone differently. It could have been 1-1.\n\nNissanka, who fully exploited some poor Zimbabwe field placings, departed when his pull shot past deep mid-wicket was caught by substitute Wessly Madhevere.\n\nAsalanka carried on until the fifth ball of the penultimate over when he skied a delivery and Brian Bennett raced from the ropes to make the catch.\n\nQuick Richard Ngarava (2-53) and seamer Brad Evans (2-54) did best among the Zimbabwe bowlers.\n\nEarlier, Ben Curran (79) and Sikandar Raza (59 not out) played pivotal roles in the Zimbabwe innings after they were put in to bat.\n\nSri Lanka quick Dushmantha Chameera (3-52) was the pick of the visiting bowlers, capturing the wickets of Bennett (21), Tony Munyonga (10) and Evans (eight).\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nZIMBABWE:\n\nB.
