The KP government does not support operation or displacement.”\n\nGandapur called on the “federal institutions” to talk to Afghanistan and resolve the issue of terrorism in the country.\n\n“We don’t want war and we will raise our voice against it,” he added.\n\nGandapur has been shifting positions on the matter.\n\nIn July, he said in a heavily-edited video message that the armed for­ces were in the province at the request of the KP government and should be treated as “guests” and with respect.\n\nThis came in complete contrast to another video statement issued by him following a PTI parliamentary meeting a day ago, in which he said that innocent civilians were martyred in a military offensive launched against militants in Bajaur district. He added that such operations had a negative impact and eroded trust between people and the forces.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTI remained opposed to military action.\n\nMore recently on Tuesday, he said that mortar shelling, drone strikes and using fighter jets against terrorists was the constitutional right of the military and that the provincial government could not stop it.\n\nAt the rally today, the KP CM also urged the judiciary to serve justice in line with the Constitution. “Deliver justice to Imran Khan, his wife and the people,” Gandapur said.\n\nThe CM further stated that PTI’s struggle for ‘Haqeeqi Azadi’ would continue until it achieved success.\n\nAddressing army chief Field Marshal Asim Munir, he said, “It is obligatory on you to play your role and sort out Imran’s issue” just as the PTI founder had played his role during the May conflict with India asked the people to stand with the armed forces.\n\nEarlier the rally, PTI leader Faisal Javed announced that “video messages” from Imran would be played at the rally.\n\n“In a while, Imran Khan will speak to you on this screen, Peshawar,” he said.\n\nLater, a video of an address by Imran was played, but it seemed to be from a previous public gathering.\n\nParty leader Azam Swati also addressed the gathering and vowed to stand tall and “continue to bear cruelty and barbarity” until Imran’s release from jail. He expressed the hope that Imran would soon come out of jail and lead the country towards development, prosperity and peace.\n\nPTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan lauded the party’s followers for standing together during the brief war with India in May.\n\n“This is the eighth rally since the elections and Pakistan has changed greatly since February 8,” he said. “In May, despite (Imran) Khan sahib being wrongfully imprisoned and not allowed to see his family, you stood with the rest of Pakistan and defeated our thuggish enemies.”\n\nGohar added that the PTI lost its mandate in these elections, but said that Imran was confident the courts would restore it. However, he continued that “the 26th Constitutional Amendment killed that hope”.\n\n“Our rally is not a power show. The world is saying that 90 per cent of people are in favour of Khan sahib — 200 million people rise at his call,” the PTI chairman said. “They want to demand one thing: this rally is for us to raise our voices and show our concerns. Injustice in one place means injustice will be everywhere.”\n\nQuoting Imran, Gohar demanded free courts, a strong parliament and democracy. “It is your duty to hear our voice,” he emphasised, addressing the government. “Do not silence the voice of 90pc of our people; end injustice, end military operations; end these wrongful convictions. We want justice. We have approached the courts for it and will continue to fight for it.”\n\nHe closed out his speech with a message from the PTI founder: “I will not compromise or make deals, I will not bend and I will remain in this country. But as long as I am here, I will stand up and live my life and will not let my country bend the knee.”\n\nPTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram delivered a fiery speech branding the federal government “thieves and killers” and slamming the Punjab government’s flood relief efforts.\n\n“Today, [Imran] Khan has called you all here … it is his rally. This is a rally for a man who has been stripped of his rights and locked in prison for standing for the right thing and sacrificing for future generations,” Akram said, addressing the crowd.\n\n“He endures every problem, mistreatment and 22-hour isolation, but remains standing in the face of it all.”\n\nThe party spokesperson said that if there were true freedom, PTI figures including Shibli Faraz, Omar Ayub, Ahmed Bachar, Aliya Hamza, Ayesha Bhutta, Khadija Shah, Zartaj Gul, Dr Yasmin Rashid and Sanam Javed would not have been “jailed for 10 years”.\n\n“Why did this happen? Because there is no true freedom. This is a government of slaves, thieves and mandate stealers,” Akram declared. “If there were true freedom, what happened to the flood victims at the hands of this shameless government would not have happened.\n\n“Look at what the KP government — Imran Khan’s government — has done: we disbursed billions to flood victims and rehabilitation has started. In Punjab, [Punjab Chief Minister] Maryam Nawaz has not even completed the initial survey. She is a liar, chasing photo-ops.”\n\nAkram impressed on the crowd that “these people are not your leaders”.\n\n“They are thieves and killers; they murdered your vote. Will you endorse these murderers? Will you condemn them?”\n\nPTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja took to the stage, emphasising that his party will not end its struggle until the “system of oppression” is brought down.\n\n“I was sitting with Imran Khan in Adiala Jail. I asked him what message he has for you all. He said: ‘Tell my nation that I will never bend before hardship. I am in jail because I value every drop of blood my nation sheds’,” Raja said.\n\n“Today, KP is drenched in blood: ours, the innocents and that of our martyrs. Balochistan, Punjab, Sindh, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are all drenched in blood. Oppression is everywhere.”\n\nRaja paid tribute to martyrs, stating that “their mothers’ tears are our tears”.\n\n“The martyrs of Tirah ask when this system of oppression will end,” he declared, referring to those affected by a recent airstrike in KP’s Tirah area. “I bring a message from Imran Khan: our struggle, our movement, will only end when the oppression does.”\n\nRaja then demanded the release of the PTI founder, as well as other party leaders and activists, who he said were “imprisoned without rights” and given “false punishments by military tribunals”.\n\nPTI stalwart Asad Qaiser said that the people of KP demand only one thing and that is peace.\n\n“We will not allow military operations in our province under any circumstances,” he emphasised. “We are tired of wars; we will not be a part of one.”\n\nQaiser also demanded that the federal government settle matters with Afghanistan through diplomatic channels and jirgas.\n\n“We in KP and Afghanistan share deep relations, so we want trade and relations so that there is peace and jobs in our province,” he stated. “I am hopeful that Ali Amin Gandapur will convince this ‘Form 47’ federal government to do so.”\n\nThe PTI leader and ex-national assembly speaker noted that there needs to be peace in this region.\n\n“We appreciate the Saudi pact, but if this country is going to progress, then it needs to establish trade relations with regional nations.”\n\nAccording to information shared by the PTI on social media, party workers and supporters have reached Peshawar from across the country to participate in the rally.\n\nWhile television channels did not air it, the PTI employed social media to broadcast the event online.\n\nEarlier, a statement issued by the office Peshawar Chief Capital Police Officer Mian Saeed Ahmed detailed the security and traffic plan ahead of the rally.\n\nThe statement read that 1,451 police personnel would be deployed as part of security arrangements and sniper shooters would be stationed on the roofs of the buildings round the rally’s venue.\n\nMeanwhile, 508 traffic personnel would be deployed at different spots under the traffic plan, the statement said.\n\nSeveral PTI leaders visited the rally’s venue and examined arrangements before the event. They included Imran Khan’s sister Aleema Khan and PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar.\n\nAhead of the gathering, PTI General Secretary Salman Akram Raja said on Friday that the party’s rally in Peshawar would raise a strong voice across the country against lawlessness, constitutional violations and restrictions on freedom of speech.\n\nAdditional input from Zahid Imdad",
