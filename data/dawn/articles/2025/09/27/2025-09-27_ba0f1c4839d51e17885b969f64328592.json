It’s quite literally who can handle the pressure for the longest that’s going to get the job done.” Australia have won 13 ICC trophies — the most in women’s cricket.\n\n“I don’t think it’s quite in the Australian culture to get too complacent about things at any point in time,” Healy said.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan captain Fatima Sana said they would aim to take advantage of the familiarity of the conditions in Colombo.\n\n“We have a significant advantage playing here [in Colombo] and executing our skills because we know we will be playing all our matches at the same venue and under the same conditions, the Pakistani skipper said at the Captains’ Day event in the Sri Lankan capital.\n\nShe added that familiarity would work in favour of the Women in Green.\n\n“Yes, definitely, our main goal is to finish in the top four. I believe the conditions in Sri Lanka are similar to those in Pakistan, so we are familiar with the exact conditions,” she continued.\n\nPakistan — under an International Cricket Council (ICC) hybrid model decided by the ICC due to political strains between New Delhi and Islamabad — will play all their matches of the event in Colombo.\n\nThe Green Shirts had qualified for the World Cup on the back of an unbeaten run in the ICC Women’s World Cup Qualifiers held in Lahore in April of this year.\n\nIndia, co-hosting their first World Cup in 12 years, carry the hopes of a cricket-mad nation as Harmanpreet Kaur prepares for her fifth World Cup and first as captain.\n\nThe twice runners-up (2005 and 2017) have a habit of stumbling at crucial moments, but Harmanpreet is determined to change the script.\n\n“Leading my country in the ODI World Cup is very special, it’s happening after 12 years (at home). It’s all about enjoying this moment,” Harmanpreet said.\n\nSophie Devine aims to close out her career with New Zealand’s second World Cup win, banking on her team’s combination of “young and vintage” players. “Suzie (Bates) and I have got a long history together, having played nearly 20 years in international cricket… ,” Devine said.\n\n“I don’t think either of us will be around much longer, so certainly we’ve come into this World Cup knowing that it’s probably going to be our last one, so we just want to enjoy it.” England will be led by Nat Sciver-Brunt, who took over as captain from Heather Knight in April.\n\nThe month-long tournament starts with India facing co-hosts Sri Lanka in Guwahati.",
