  "content": "Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has termed his recent meeting with US President Donald Trump as “very encouraging”.\n\nHis came after the two leaders had their first formal bilateral interaction at the Oval Office in Washington on Thursday. During the meeting, they discussed regional security and cooperation along the lines of counter-terrorism, among other matters.\n\nThe premier was accompanied by the Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir, while the US President was joined by US Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe meeting itself was closed to the press — a break from President Trump’s usual modus operandi — as he is quite fond of Oval Office photo-ops and there was no press conference either; just a statement issued from Pakistan where the US president was described as a “man of peace” and stressing the need to enhance cooperation in security and intelligence.\n\nDuring an interaction with the media in New Jersey, which was aired on Geo News on Saturday morning, the premier said the US was ready to share “techniques” with Pakistan in the areas of artificial intelligence, information technology and agriculture. The PM added that the US was also open to investment opportunities in the country.\n\n“We have signed an MoU (memorandum of understanding) with one of their delegations,” he said, without sharing any further details.\n\nPM Shehbaz said Pakistan’s economy has “stabilised at the macro level” and also credited overseas Pakistanis for their contributions and efforts. “No amount of gratitude is enough,” he said.\n\nThe premier also hailed Field Marshal Asim Munir for leading the nation “from the front” during a four-day military encounter between Pakistan in India in May.\n\n“He led Pakistan with courage, boldness, and intelligence,” the PM said.\n\nSoon after the escalation, Pakistan had said it had downed six Indian jets. However, the PM said on Friday that the number of downed Indian jets was seven.",
