That should shake off any complacency that might have crept into their campaign.\n\n“(I got) what I wanted from the boys — just to try and execute their plans, be clear and not to fear,” Suryakumar said of their flawless campaign heading into the final.\n\n“That was really important, and I am sure everyone got what they wanted. Happy to be in the final.”\n\nPakistan will naturally be motivated to avoid a third defeat to the arch-rivals in a single tournament and will take heart from their thrilling victory in Thursday’s virtual semi-final against Bangladesh.\n\n“Very excited,” Pakistan captain Salman Agha said of the final against India. “We know what we need to do, and we are a good enough team to beat anyone, and we will come on Sunday and try to beat them.”\n\nAhead of the high-profile clash, Pakistan Cricket Board chief and Asian Cricket Council chairman Mohsin Naqvi has stirred up a stirred up a hornet’s nest with an ambiguous post on X about a “balancing act”.\n\n“How much time do you need to explain the reasons behind the balancing act?,” he wrote on X, leaving fans pondering if it was intended for the Indian team given its timing.",
