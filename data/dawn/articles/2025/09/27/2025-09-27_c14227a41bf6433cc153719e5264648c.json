Atletico rose provisionally to fourth.\n\n“There are no excuses, we’re hurting, it’s a derby and a deserved defeat,” said Alonso, after his side conceded five against their rivals for the first time since 1950.\n\nAtletico’s joy was evident, with Simeone visibly emotional on the sideline as his team racked up the scoreline.\n\n“There’s a lot of emotions… we’ve had a troubled start to the season,” said Simeone.\n\n“From the start of the game, we knew where we could hurt them… today was a very, very good (performance).” Led by a flying Mbappe, Real came into Alonso’s first derby at the helm as the only side in the league with a 100 percent record.\n\nAlthough the French superstar scored again to reach eight league goals for the season, Atletico attacked relentlessly and deserved their victory.\n\nReal Madrid started Jude Bellingham for the first time since his shoulder surgery in the summer, but the England international struggled to make an impact.\n\nGiuliano Simeone, coach Diego Simeone’s son, took advantage of slack Madrid defending to whip in a cross which Le Normand headed home after 14 minutes to open the scoring.\n\nThe visitors reacted well.\n\nMbappe levelled with a crisp finish after breaking in down the right. Atletico were taking the game to Real Madrid, with Alonso’s side content to spring forward on the counter, trying to use the pace of Vinicius Junior and Mbappe.\n\nThe Brazilian winger created Madrid’s second goal, turning brilliantly in the box to break away from Marcos Llorente and Le Normand, before crossing for Guler to strike.\n\nAlvarez, who netted a hat-trick against Rayo Vallecano in midweek, curled a shot around Thibaut Courtois but against the post as Atletico continued pushing.\n\nAtletico defender Clement Lenglet put the ball in the net but the Frenchman used his forearm to deflect it home.\n\nIn first-half stoppage time, Atletico pulled level. Sorloth, lurking behind Dean Huijsen, planted a header beyond Courtois.\n\nThe Norwegian striker celebrated with Atletico fans, who embraced him — a risky move when already on a yellow card, but he was not dismissed.\n\nAtletico moved in front for the second time when Guler gave away a penalty for a high boot, catching Nico Gonzalez’s head.\n\nAlvarez, who had a penalty controversially disallowed in a Champions League shoot-out the last time the sides met, beat Courtois from the spot, even though the Belgian went the right way.\n\n“Each penalty is a new penalty, a new game, a new chance,” said Alvarez. Courtois saved from Sorloth, but despite getting a hand to Alvarez’s free-kick, he could not keep it out as Atletico pushed two goals clear.\n\nOn as a substitute, Atletico talisman Griezmann wrapped up a superb victory, rolling the ball past Courtois as the home fans rocked in delight.\n\nThe players did a lap of honour, after only their third league win of the season, but it was a vital one.\n\n“It’s a very special day, we knew how important this game was, being a derby of course but also because we needed the three points,” Alvarez told DAZN.\n\nReal Madrid’s defeat means champions Barcelona have the chance to move top, if they beat Real Sociedad on Sunday.\n\n“Few words can console us, but tomorrow the sun will come out and we will work harder than ever,” pledged Real Madrid defender Dani Carvajal.",
