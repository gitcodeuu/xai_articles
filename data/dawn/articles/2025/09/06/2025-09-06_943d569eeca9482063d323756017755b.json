  "content": "MONTEVIDEO: Lionel Messi made sure he had good memories of playing a home World Cup qualifier with Argentina’s national team for the last time in his illustrious career on Thursday, while Paraguay and Colombia secured berths at the 2026 tournament in North America.\n\nEight-time Ballon d’Or winner Messi scored twice Thursday in Argentina’s 3-0 victory over Venezuela in front of a raucous sellout crowd that had gathered at Estadio Monumental in Buenos Aires to bid him farewell.\n\n“Being able to finish this way here is what I’ve always dreamed of,” an emotional Messi said. “For many years I had the affection of Barcelona fans and my dream was to have it here in my country too. I’ve experienced a lot of things on this pitch, both good and not so good, but it’s always a joy to play in Argentina, in front of our fans.”\n\nMessi is yet to give any clues about when he will retire from the top level of the sport. But the qualifiers for the 2030 World Cup will begin in 2027, when he’s 40.\n\nThe reigning World Cup champions, who have already qualified for the tournament in Canada, Mexico and the US, controlled proceedings from the opening whistle, creating chances through Nicolas Tagliafico and Franco Mastantuono only to be thwarted by Venezuela goalkeeper Rafael Romo.\n\nMessi broke the deadlock in the 39th minute, the Argentine captain underlining his enduring quality in front of an adoring crowd of 80,000 by latching onto a pass from Julian Alvarez on a swift counter-attack and firing home into the top-right corner of Romo’s net.\n\nArgentina maintained their relentless pressure in the second half, with Messi remaining the focal point of their attack, but the hosts had to wait until the 76th minute for a second goal, Nico Gonzalez delivering from the left for Lautaro Martinez to score with a diving header.\n\nFour minutes later, Messi capped off another excellent performance with a third goal, assisted by Thiago Almada.\n\nMessi now has 36 goals in South American World Cup qualifiers and remains as the all-time scoring leader. His Inter Miami team-mate Luis Suarez has 29 goals in continental qualifying, but he has retired from Uruguay’s national team. Bolivia’s Marcelo Moreno Martins is third with 22.\n\nLooking ahead, Messi clarified that he will only compete in next year’s World Cup if he feels physically fit,\n\n“I’m excited, eager. It’s day by day, feeling the sensations. If I feel good, I enjoy it; if not, I’d rather not be there,” he said, adding that the nine months until the tournament kicks off “is a long time.”\n\nAsked about his possible retirement, Messi who has scored a record 36 goals in South American qualifying, said: “It’s not something I like, want or expect. But time is passing, and it’s been many years.”\n\nAlready qualified, Lionel Scaloni’s side extended their tally to 38 points and will remain atop the South American qualifying standings regardless of what happens in the last round next Tuesday. Scaloni will rest his skipper for the dead-rubber at Ecuador.\n\n“He made an enormous effort and deserves a rest and to be with his family,” said the coach. “He ended up very tired and physically exhausted. He should have come off, but he didn’t because of the emotional nature of the match.”\n\nMessi had his three sons with him before kickoff and his father, Jorge, was also in attendance to mark the occasion.\n\nVenezuela, trying to qualify for their first World Cup, remain on 18 points and in seventh place. They will host Colombia aiming to stay in the intercontinental playoff spot, with Bolivia just a point behind.\n\nIn other matches on Thursday, Brazil moved up to second place with 28 points after a 3-0 win over Chile at the Maracana stadium in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nChelsea teenager Estevao opened the scoring with an overhead kick from close range, before a probing run and cross from Luiz Henrique set up Lucas Paqueta to head in from point-blank range.\n\nBruno Guimaraes sealed the result with a simple tap-in after Henrique’s shot rebounded off the underside of the crossbar.\n\n“We played intense football, with good rhythm, a solid defense and a lot of pressure,” Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti said. “I think that, like us, the fans are very happy with the team’s performance.”\n\nBIELSA DOES IT AGAIN\n\nUruguay sealed their berth in the United States, Canada and Mexico by beating Peru 3-0 at home and moving to third on 27 points.\n\nIn front of 60,000 at a packed-out Estadio Centenario in Montevideo, Rodrigo Aguirre put Marcelo Bielsa’s Uruguay on their way on 14 minutes.\n\nThe Club America forward leapt highest to place a thumping header into the top corner past Peru goalkeeper Pedro Gallese.\n\nThe Uruguayans, winners of the World Cup in 1930 and 1950, had needed just a point to qualify and send their charismatic veteran coach Bielsa to the tournament once again. The 70-year-old has now taken a third team to World Cup qualification.\n\nBielsa’s appointment as Uruguay coach in 2023 was greeted with excitement, even euphoria, but an underwhelming qualification campaign has dampened that enthusiasm.\n\nQualification was always likely in a system that sees six of the 10 CONMEBOL sides qualify automatically for 2026, with one more heading into an inter-continental play-off.\n\nGiorgian de Arrascaeta doubled Uruguay’s lead just before the hour, lashing home from close range to ensure a party atmosphere in the Uruguayan capital. Federico Vinas scored a third 10 minutes from time.\n\n“We have players who are gradually improving ... and who were able to live up to the demands of a match we needed to win,” Bielsa said, declining to predict whether his team could win football’s ultimate prize. “Hope is not the same as predictions. Hope is what drives us. Predictions in football are very difficult to make.”\n\nEcuador dropped to fourth on 26 points after a goalless draw against Paraguay, who secured their first World Cup appearance in 16 years.\n\nLike Uruguay, Paraguay needed only a draw to qualify when they hosted Ecuador. They got the job done and will be at their ninth World Cup — but first since 2010.\n\n“The key was to win the players’ support, trying to agree not just on an idea, but on the way we wanted people to see us,” Paraguay manager Gustavo Alfaro told reporters. “I never realised what was going to come next and I never realized the passion this country could show for something as beautiful as football.”\n\nColombia also sealed their place in next summer’s extravaganza thanks to a comfortable 3-0 victory over Bolivia.\n\nThe 34-year-old former Real Madrid and Bayern Munich attacker James Rodriguez, the breakout star of the 2014 World Cup, pounced just after the half-hour mark.\n\nJhon Cordoba made sure there were no late scares with his goal in the 74th minute, before Juan Fernando Quintero made it three for “Los Cafeteros”, who sit fifth in the standings with 25 points.\n\n“We would like to have done it sooner, but we’re very happy to be going to the World Cup,” Colombia manager Nestor Lorenzo said. “Those waits are long and hard because they fill you with anxiety. We just wanted to give something back to the fans for the support they have shown us.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 6th, 2025",
