Law enforcement also identified 12 points along the procession route for participants, with all main roads closed to general traffic during the procession.\n\nThe district administration imposed a ban on the use of rickshaws and motorcycles along the procession route and instructed committees not to use loudspeakers in mosques or homes, while musical instruments would be prohibited in the procession.\n\nThey also asked Milad committees to submit a list of the vehicles to be used in the main procession so that security measures could be adopted and vehicles checked thoroughly before entering the procession.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner, Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema, stated that religious scholars from different schools of thought had been included in the planning, and the district’s Peace Committee would take part in the procession.\n\nHe added that security measures would be taken in the city, primarily on the route of the procession, as the administration had adopted in Muharram.\n\n“All roads and streets will be closed a day earlier on Wednesday, and containers will be placed around Raja Bazaar to prevent acts of terrorism,” he said.\n\nHe further mentioned that the Rawalpindi waste management company had been asked to make all the arrangements to keep the city clean.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 6th, 2025",
