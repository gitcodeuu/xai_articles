She has also served as a deputy governor at the Bank of England.\n\nRayner’s troubles\n\nRayner’s resignation followed her self-referral to the independent adviser on ministerial standards.\n\nShe disclosed on Wednesday that she had underpaid stamp duty — a property tax — on an apartment following days of reports suggesting that she had saved thousands of pounds by removing her name from the deeds of another property.\n\nAfter reviewing her case, Laurie Magnus wrote to the PM, saying that in his opinion, she had breached the ministerial code.\n\nHe pointed out that while the tax rules Rayner was dealing with are “complex”, the fact that she didn’t seek expert advice means that she did not meet the “highest possible standards of proper conduct”, as required by the Ministerial Code.\n\nIn her resignation, Rayner took full responsibility for the error. In response, Starmer said she had done the right thing.\n\nRayner had been tipped as a potential future Labour leader and has been a top target for political attacks by the opposition Conservatives and right-wing media.\n\nDespite the circumstances of her exit, Starmer told her: “You will remain a major figure in our party”.\n\nShabana’s rise\n\nShabana Mahmood, the 44-year-old Labour MP for Birmingham Ladywood, has had a rapid rise. She becomes the second Home Secretary of Pakistani-origin, with Tory minister Sajid Javid being the first in 2018.\n\nBorn in Birmingham to parents with roots in Mirpur in Azad Kashmir, Mahmood often links her political outlook to her family’s migration story and the values she absorbed growing up around a corner shop in inner-city Birmingham.\n\nIn a New Statesman interview, she linked her parents’ politics to the party “that made them feel they had a stake in British society“, adding that her family “found opportunities in this country that would not have been available to us in the village that we hail from in Kashmir and then Pakistan.”\n\nDuring her childhood she also lived for a period with her family in Taif, Saudi Arabia. She went on to study at the University of Oxford and graduated with a BA in Law, later working as a barrister.\n\nMahmood also became one of the UK’s first Muslim parliamentarians when she was elected in 2010 alongside other MPs.\n\nShe has spoken directly about representing Britain’s Pakistani communities.\n\n“I…take pride in representing one of the biggest ethnic minority groups in the UK,” she told the British Pakistan Foundation in an interview, arguing that the government should work at the community levels.\n\nShe also rejected claims that Pakistanis do not hold British values, saying: “They respect the rule of law, they want to live in a democracy.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 6th, 2025",
