Second seed Alcaraz said he would try not to think about Trump in the crowd as he bids for his sixth Grand Slam title.\n\n“I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it,” the Spaniard told reporters on Friday after defeating 24-time major winner Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals.\n\n“But I think, you know, attending the tennis match, it’s great for tennis to have the president at the final.”\n\nTrump is far from the first US president to step into the megawatt spotlight of professional sports.\n\nBarack appeared on ESPN to fill out his “March Madness” bracket while in office and George W Bush famously threw out the first pitch at Shea Stadium in 2001, when the Mets took on the Atlanta Braves for the city’s first major sporting event after the September 11 attacks.\n\nBut few have embraced sports’ biggest events with the same gusto as Trump, particularly in his second term.\n\nTrump grabbed headlines when he became the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl in February, stepping into the media glare of America’s most-watched annual event.\n\nThe fans at New Orleans’ Superdome greeted him with a mix of cheers and boos, and he met briefly in the stadium with families of the victims of the New Year’s Day attack on Bourbon Street as well as police officers and emergency workers.\n\nMonths later, Trump announced from the White House that Washington, DC, would host the 2027 NFL Draft, an annual mega-event that regularly attracts hundreds of thousands of fans.\n\nHe attended FIFA’s Club World Cup final in July, where he sat in box seats at MetLife Stadium with FIFA boss Gianni Infantino and remained on the stage during the trophy lift with winners Chelsea, to the confusion of some of the players.\n\nDays after Alcaraz and top seed Sinner play, Trump is expected to attend the New York Yankees game against the Detroit Tigers on the 24th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.\n\nLater this month, he is expected to attend the Ryder Cup, the biennial international golf competition, on Long Island.\n\nAt the US Open, Trump will attend as a “client guest”, organisers said, and will watch from that guest’s respective suite at the famed Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n“It is a privilege for the tournaments having the president from every country just to support the tournament, to support tennis and to support the match,” Alcaraz said.",
