Alibaba.com, a leading global B2B e-commerce platform, has signed the MoU with Ignite — Nat­ional Technology Fund, which operates under the IT ministry.\n\nThe collaboration aims to strengthen Pakistan’s digital economy and expand global opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and startups.\n\nUnder the agreement, Alibaba.com will organise and facilitate online and offline promotional activities, such as Pakistan trade shows and an online national pavilion. It will also deliver targeted B2B e-commerce training and provide AI-powered tools to selected SMEs and startups.\n\nIgnite will assist in implementation by identifying potential exporters, coordinating seminars in major cities, and promoting Alibaba-led initiatives across the country.\n\nShaza Fatima said Pakistan stood at the cusp of global e-commerce opportunities, where the passion and entrepreneurial skills of its youth could enable them to showcase their products and abilities at the international level. She described the partnership with Alibaba.com as an important step for Pakistan’s digital economy.\n\n“By equipping our SMEs and startups with advanced e-commerce tools and access to global markets, and by aligning our institutions with international best practices, we aim to foster innovation, support export growth, and strengthen Pakistan’s participation in global digital trade,” she added.\n\nAlibaba.com has already played an active role in Pakistan, rolling out its Trade Assurance service with an 85 per cent activation rate within months of its launch. It has also helped sellers adopt its AI-powered Smart Assistant, which is now used by 80pc of Pakistani sellers, enhancing trust and operational efficiency.\n\nIn the second quarter of 2025, Pakistan recorded a 60pc year-on-year increase in new suppliers on Alibaba.com, led by the apparel, sports and entertainment, and surgical instruments sectors.\n\nFollowing the signing of MoU, the Pakistani delegation visited Alibaba’s campus in Beijing and discussed ways to expand Pakistan’s role in global supply chains, improve e-commerce training for SMEs, and explore further cooperation in AI and digital trade facilitation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 6th, 2025",
