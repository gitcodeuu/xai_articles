Iqbal Stadium holds a proud place in our cricketing history and we are excited to bring international cricket back to this part of the country.”\n\nPakistan is currently participating in a tri-series tournament with Afghanistan and hosts the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where they reached the finals by defeating the hosts by 31 runs.\n\nThe tournament precedes the Asia Cup 2025 — also held in the UAE from September 9 to 28 — where the Green Shirts are expected to clash with arch-rivals India.",
