But I don’t feel like I’ve won anything more than a Grand Slam semi-final,” Alcaraz said after downing the 38-year-old Djokovic.\n\n“It was an important match, but it was just a ticket to the final.”\n\nDjokovic said he plans to chase more Grand Slams next year, but admitted he was no longer physically capable of matching Alcaraz and Sinner.\n\n“I’m happy with my level of tennis, but you know, it’s just the physicality of it,” Djokovic said after his exit. “That’s something I, unfortunately at this point in time in my career, can’t control.”\n\nSinner meanwhile appeared to be readying another quickfire win as he sprinted through the opening set of his clash with the rangy Auger-Aliassime.\n\nBut the Canadian leveled by taking the second set only for Sinner to respond to claim the next two and a return to the final.\n\nSinner, who also won the Australian Open in January, is now only the fourth man in history to reach the finals of all four Grand Slams in a single season, joining an exclusive club whose other members are Rod Laver, Roger Federer and Djokovic.\n\n“It’s been an amazing season. The Grand Slams are the most important tournaments we have throughout the year,” Sinner said.\n\nThe Italian’s date with Alcaraz is also a rematch of their famous 2022 US Open quarter-final five-setter, which finished at around 2:50am and remains the latest finish in tournament history.\n\n“Sunday is a very special day and an amazing final again. I feel like our rivalry started here playing an amazing match,” Sinner said in a nod to their 2022 classic.\n\n“We are two different players now, with different confidence too. Let’s see what’s coming. We’ve played each other a lot, we know each other very well.”\n\nSunday’s final meanwhile will have a rare visit from a sitting US President after confirmation earlier on Friday that Trump plans to attend the tennis showpiece.\n\nTrump’s visit, confirmed to AFP by a White House official, is the latest appearance by the US leader at a major sporting event following trips to the Super Bowl in February and the FIFA Club World Cup final in July.\n\n“For me, playing in front of him… I will try not to think about it,” Alcaraz said of Trump’s presence. “I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it, but I think, attending the tennis match, it’s great for tennis to have the president (at) the final.”\n\nToday, the women’s singles final will be decided when defending champion and world number Aryna Sabalenka faces American eighth seed Amanda Anisimova.\n\nIn the women’s doubles final on Friday, Gabriela Dabrowski and Erin Routliffe won their second US Open women’s doubles title in three years after beating Taylor Townsend and Katerina Siniakova 6-4, 6-4.",
