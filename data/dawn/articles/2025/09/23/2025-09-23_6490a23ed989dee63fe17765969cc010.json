The tracks at Laki Shah Sadar and Amri were also inundated.\n\nA privately raised dyke near Manzoorabad eroded due to immense pressure of floodwater. Gushing deluge was moving towards the populated areas with full force.\n\nThe road leading to Budhapur had come under deep water severely affecting movement of local residents.\n\nIn Sehwan taluka, five more villages — Long Khan, Sadiq Sahto, Amin Shahani, Lal Bakhsh Laghari, and Kacha Radhan — were hit by floodwater bringing the number of affected villages to over 20.\n\nFour other villages in the Petaro area were also hit by flowing discharges restricting local residents to their homes.\n\nIn both Sehwan and Manhand talukas, about 15 government schools and eight health facilities were hit by severe flooding making them to stop functioning.\n\nThe Larkana-Sehwan Bund is said to be under immense pressure floodwater. Deluges have also hit the Sehwan-Hyder­abad section of the Indus Highway at Bhagotoro.\n\nFormer MNA Sardar Sikandar Ali Rahopoto visited the Chhachhar Loop Bund near Amri on Monday to assess the situation.\n\nHe reviewed the strengthening work and received a briefed from the officials concerned at the site.\n\n“A new dyke is being constructed ahead of the Laki Shah Sadar to supplement the Amri Loop Bund strength,” he said.\n\nThe Sindh government was taking all possible measures to ensure public safety and control the floodwater, he added.\n\nIrrigation officials were also present during the former MNA’s visit.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025",
