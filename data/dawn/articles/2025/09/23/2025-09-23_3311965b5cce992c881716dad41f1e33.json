Britain, France and Germany have offered to delay reinstating sanctions for up to six months if Iran restores access for UN nuclear inspectors, addresses concerns about its stock of enriched uranium, and engages in talks with the US.\n\nThe council also voted to reimpose UN sanctions that had been frozen, after three European governments activated the “snapback” mechanism in a decade-old nuclear agreement accusing Iran of non-compliance.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025",
