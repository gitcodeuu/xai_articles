In 2014, he was named president of The Yorkshire County Cricket Club, a role he held with pride and distinction.”\n\nBird played for English counties Yorkshire and Leicestershire but made his name as an international umpire.\n\n“Over a distinguished career, he officiated in 66 Test matches and 69 one-day internationals, including three World Cup finals — earning the admiration of players and fans alike for his integrity, humour, and unmistakable style,” Yorkshire’s statement said.\n\nHe was given a guard of honour at Lord’s by England and India players before his final Test.\n\nGeoffrey Boycott, the Yorkshire and England batting great, had an enduring friendship with Bird from their days playing for Barnsley Cricket Club in the 1950s.\n\nThe 84-year-old summed up Bird’s quirky nature when he recalled how his friend used to insist on calling him Gerald, despite his protestations.\n\n“I would say, ‘My name’s not Gerald, it’s Geoffrey’,” Boycott wrote in the Telegraph. “It made no difference telling him because he would then say, ‘OK, put the gloves on for me Gerald’.\n\n“Dickie was a character and he was always fun. He was respected, admired and loved. He will be given a fond farewell.”\n\nFormer England captain David Gower hailed Bird as “one of the best umpires ever to take the field”.\n\n“He certainly set himself high standards as an umpire, but that smile on his face at all times, whether he’s giving you out or not out, whatever he was doing out in the middle, you just knew that Dickie was in the place that he loved best,” Gower told the BBC.\n\n“He was just a very, very good umpire. He had a sense of humour. He had the ability in his own very quirky and slightly barmy way of being able to get on with everyone.”\n\nGraham Gooch, another former England captain, fondly recalled Bird’s habit of becoming embroiled in unusual incidents during matches.\n\n“At Headingley once they had a leaking pipe, right where Dickie was standing,” said Gooch. “Coming up like a sprinkler. It could only happen to him.”\n\nColin Graves, chairman of Yorkshire, told TalkSport: “It’s a sad day.\n\n“He was a brilliant guy who loved being part of the Yorkshire set-up and everything we do here. He will be sadly missed at Headingley.”\n\nESPNcricinfo also posted about Bird on X.\n\n“[Marylebone Cricket Club] is deeply saddened to hear of the death of Harold “Dickie” Bird,” Lord’s Cricket Ground posted on X.\n\n“An Honorary Life Member of the Club, Dickie enjoyed an illustrious career as an umpire and was one of the most popular officials in the history of the game.”",
