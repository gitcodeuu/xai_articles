  "content": "SHANGLA: Residents of Puran tehsil have demanded of the government to rehabilitate the flood-hit government high school in Drad Bar area.\n\nMore than a month after the flash floods wreaked havoc in Shangla, the school remains in a state of ruin, with half of the building, including the science classroom, still filled with debris.\n\nThe lack of rehabilitation has forced students to continue their studies in unsafe conditions.\n\nAccording to head teacher Subhanullah, 240 students are currently enrolled. He said major cracks had developed in the building, threatening the lives of students.\n\nSubhanullah said the school’s science room was filled with debris, while the other classrooms were temporarily restored by teachers and students collectively.\n\nDayan Ghaffar, a local resident, told Dawn that the situation reflected sheer negligence on part of the education department. “The entire science room and adjoining classrooms are unusable. Debris and mud are still lying inside, but no official has bothered to clear it,” said Mr Ghaffar.\n\nHe added that students had been left with no option but to sit in cramped spaces or in the open.\n\nMohammad Saeed, a student, said despite repeated appeals to the authorities, no progress had been made in restoring the school. “This negligence is not only damaging their education but also affecting their morale,” he remarked.\n\nHe noted that the delay in rehabilitation was causing psychological strain on the students. “They see their school in ruins every day and wonder why nobody cares. The authorities must take immediate action before it leads to more dropouts,” he warned.\n\nThe flash floods killed 36 people in the district, while search operations for five missing bodies are still under way.\n\nDozens of schools, health facilities and houses were either damaged or destroyed.\n\nEducation activists have also criticised the government for its negligence.\n\nThey said restoring schools should have been among the top priorities, especially in rural districts where children already face significant barriers to education.\n\nAttempts were made by Dawn to contact the district education officer to obtain the official version, but he did not answer phone calls.\n\nMeanwhile, parents and local elders have appealed to the provincial government to immediately rehabilitate the school.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025",
