  "content": "COLOMBO: Pakistan twice came from behind in an enthralling SAFF Under-17 Championship clash against India, only for their arch-rivals to go ahead for a third time and eventually clinch a 3-2 victory at the Colombo Racecourse Stadium on Monday that secured top spot in the group.\n\nGoals in each half by Pakistan’s Mohammad Abdullah, from the penalty spot, and Hamza Yasir had levelled the Group ‘B’ clash at 2-2 by the 70th minute but India’s substitute Rahan Ahmed found the winner in the 73rd to take his side through to a semi-final against Group ‘A’ runners-up Nepal.\n\nPakistan, meanwhile, take on Group ‘A’ winners Bangladesh with both last-four clashes to be held on Thursday.\n\nBoth teams had already secured semi-final berths and heading into the final group game, Pakistan held the advantage by the barest of margins — on goals scored — and a draw would’ve sufficed for Nasir Ismail’s side to avoid Bangladesh, who have ousted them in the semis stage of each of the last two editions.\n\nBangladesh also beat Pakistan in the final of the 2018 edition but the current crop would be confident of their chances, especially after a valiant display against four-time defending champions India.\n\nAfter even exchanges in the opening half hour, India took the lead in the 31st minute when Danny Singh Wangkhem’s cutback was hammered in by Dallalmoun Gangte.\n\nPakistan immediately sought an equaliser and it arrived two minutes before half-time when Hamza’s darting run drew a foul in the box and Abdullah sent Indian custodian Manashjyoti Baruah the wrong way from the resulting spot-kick.\n\nAn end-to-end game then swung into India’s favour in the 63rd when Gunleiba Wangkheirakpam ran onto a throughball and slotted it past the advancing Saamar Razzak.\n\nHamza ensured parity seven minutes later when he turned in a rebound after Baruah spilled a long-range effort from Mohammad Awais.\n\nIt didn’t last long though as Rahan reacted first to a save by Razzak and netted the winner.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025",
