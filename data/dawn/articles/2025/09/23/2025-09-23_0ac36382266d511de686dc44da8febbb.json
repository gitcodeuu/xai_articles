No one was hurt in the incident.\n\nIn April, the 3UP train heading from Karachi to Quetta was stopped at Jacobabad railway station due to security reasons.\n\nTrain services betw­een Quetta and the rest of the country were restored on March 27, after they were suspended due to the unprecedented hijacking of the Pesha­war-bound Jaffar Express earlier that month.\n\nThe train, travelling from Quetta to Peshawar and carrying 440 passengers, was hijacked near Balochistan’s Sibi area on March 11, resulting in the deaths of 21 passengers and four security personnel. “All 33 terrorists” were neutralised during the two-day clearance operation, the military said.",
