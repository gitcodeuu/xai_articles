However, the local councils are not reporting the use of the funds to anyone. The local councils will have to be accountable,” he snapped.\n\nThe PAC ordered the regional directors of the LG department to inspect the local councils of their respective divisions.\n\nIt also directed the LG department to computerise the records of employees of all local councils across Sindh and to conduct biometrics of employees.\n\nThe PAC further ordered the suspension of the chief municipal officer of the Gambat Municipal Committee for not depositing Rs7m in sales tax into the government treasury.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025",
