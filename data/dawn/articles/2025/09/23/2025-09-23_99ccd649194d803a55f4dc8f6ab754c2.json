He said that China’s assistance, from humanitarian relief to medical supplies, symbolised the depth of brotherhood.\n\nOn economic cooperation, he hailed the China-Pakistan Economic Corri­dor (CPEC) as a flagship initiative and a proud cha­pter in the partnership.\n\nHe described Gwadar Port as a gateway of trade and prosperity, reiterating that CPEC is not just about infrastructure but also about shared dreams and prosperity for the people of both nations.\n\nPaying rich tribute to the founding architects of Pak-China relations, inc­luding Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Premier Zhou Enlai, the Senate chairm­­an underscored their visi­o­­nary leadership.\n\nHe stated that Pakistan attaches immense value to its relations with China, describing the anniversary as a moment to celebrate China’s extraordinary achievements.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 23rd, 2025",
