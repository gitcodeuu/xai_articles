Protecting the lives and property of the public is our top priority, and such cowardly acts only strengthen the morale of our force,” he said.\n\nRecently, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of terrorist attacks, particularly targeting police personnel.\n\nLast month, police carried out a search and targeted operation alongside security forces in Bannu, arresting “14 terrorist facilitators“ and destroying “three hideouts”.\n\nIn July, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred when terrorists attacked him in Bannu.",
