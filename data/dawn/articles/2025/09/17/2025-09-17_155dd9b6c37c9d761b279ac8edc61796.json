One proposal given by the PCB is to have Richie Richardson stand in its match against the UAE but whether that would happen or not is the big question.\n\nIf Pakistan beat the home side in Dubai they will face neighbours India again on Sunday in the next round.\n\nLast Sunday’s seven-wicket defeat to India was the first time the rivals had faced off in cricket since the countries fought a brief but deadly border conflict in May.\n\nAccording to PTI, the situation arose due to PCB’s international cricket director Usman Wahla, who didn’t apprise Salman about the rules and regulations that are to be followed during the tournament.\n\nIt is learnt that an irate PCB chief Mohsin, who is also the current chairman of the ACC, ordered the sacking of Walha on Monday “for the embarrassment caused to the national cricket team and its captain”, PTI said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 17th, 2025",
