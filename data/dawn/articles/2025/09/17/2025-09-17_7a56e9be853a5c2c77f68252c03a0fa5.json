Talks may touch on remaining levies on steel, whisky and salmon.\n\n“They want to see if they can refine the trade deal a little bit,” Trump said when he left the White House for Britain on Tuesday.\n\nBut while Starmer is banking on the unrivalled royal allure helping cajole the Anglophile president, many pitfalls for Britain’s prime minister remain.\n\nPolls show Trump is widely unpopular in Britain and Starmer, faced with plummeting poll ratings of his own and economic woes, will need to show that his royal trump card can reap benefits.\n\nStarmer faces political troubles at home after sacking his UK ambassador to Washington, Peter Mandelson, over his links to the late Epstein.\n\nAwkward questions about Epstein could also come to the fore.\n\nCommuters in the capital had mixed views about the visit, with some angry about the invitation and others saying it was smart politics and a good use of Britain’s soft power.\n\n“We’re looking to sort of make the best of a bad situation,” said lawyer Kirstie Robertshaw, 54.\n\nFor Charles himself, the visit might provoke mixed emotions. He has little in common with Trump, from his 50 years championing environmental causes to his efforts to bring harmony between religions and his recent steadfast support for Canada, where he is head of state.\n\nBut the occasion will also afford him the greatest global attention since his coronation.\n\n“If it goes well … I think this will go down as the most consequential event in his reign,” said historian Anthony Seldon.",
