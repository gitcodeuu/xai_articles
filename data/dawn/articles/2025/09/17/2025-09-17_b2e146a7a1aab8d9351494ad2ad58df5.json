The report came as Israel on Tuesday launched a ground assault on Gaza City, where the UN has declared a full-blown famine.\n\nThe COI concluded that Israeli authorities and forces had since October 2023 committed “four of the five genocidal acts” listed in the 1948 Genocide Convention.\n\nThese are “killing members of the group, causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group, deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part, and imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group”.\n\nThe investigators said explicit statements by Israeli civilian and military authorities and their patterns of military action “indicated that the genocidal acts were committed with intent to destroy… Palestinians in the Gaza Strip as a group”.\n\nThey concluded that Israeli Presi­dent Isaac Herzog, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defence minister Yoav Gallant have “incited the commission of genocide and that Israeli authorities have failed to take action against them to punish this incitement”.\n\n“The responsibility for these atrocity crimes lies with Israeli authorities at the highest echelons,” stated Pillay, 83, a South African former judge who once headed the international tribunal for Rwanda and also served as UN human rights chief.\n\nCommissioner Chris Sidoti, meanwhile, stressed that the people of Israel too “have been betrayed by their government”, whose “genocidal war… has made (their) peace and security… almost impossible for the foreseeable future”.\n\n“Their trauma and their suffering has been ruthlessly manipulated by Netanyahu and his cronies,” he told journalists.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 17th, 2025",
