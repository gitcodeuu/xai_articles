Women wept over the dead, while men stood in prayer beside the bodies.\n\nPiles of concrete blocks and gaping holes marked the site of the strike that hit a building in the camp.\n\nGroups of men and children picked through the debris, salvaging what they could of their belongings.\n\nIyad Shokr, who survived the strike on Nuseirat, said the attack came just before dawn. “The debris collapsed on our floor. By the will of God some survived while others were martyred,” he said.\n\nSeven members of the Bakr family were killed overnight in the strike on Al-Shati refugee camp in Gaza City, where Israeli forces have stepped up a ground and air assault.\n\nThe dead included children and women, according to the Gaza civil defence agency, a rescue force operating under Hamas authority, which said several others were also wounded in the Israeli strike.\n\n“What is happening are massacres, massacres that are condemned internationally,” said Umm Khaleel, who survived when the family home was hit.\n\nGaza’s main Al-Shifa hospital confirmed receiving six bodies of victims killed in the strike.\n\n“We cannot sleep because of the bombing and shelling on Al-Shati… the children were sleeping when suddenly a missile landed on us,” said Salwa Subhi Bakr.\n\n“What does the world want from us?”.\n\nBakr, displaced by the nearly two-year-long war, said families had nowhere safe to flee. “They tell us go there, then come back here. Where do we get the money for trucks?” she said. “People are in the streets, in the south scattered everywhere. Where should we go? Find us a solution.”\n\nWhile Trump is due to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu after on Sept 29 after telling reporters on Friday it “looks like we have a deal on Gaza”, a Hamas official said on Saturday the Palestinian group had not received Trump’s Gaza ceasefire plan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 28th, 2025",
