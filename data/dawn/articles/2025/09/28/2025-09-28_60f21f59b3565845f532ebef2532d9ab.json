The meeting was also briefed on the monitoring systems of the Auqaf, Trust, and Cooperative departments.\n\nIt was told that the Punjab Cabinet had recently approved the Auqaf, Trusts and Cooperative Societies Management Act 2025, which would serve as a model for other provinces.\n\nThe meeting commended the performance of the labour department, police, social welfare department, and Child Protection and Welfare Bureau for their contribution to combating human trafficking.\n\nAs the performance of the Punjab Charities Commission came under review, commission’s chief executive officer retired Col Shehzad Amir said that more than 8,000 NGOs had been registered so far across the province while monitoring, digitisation, and outreach systems had been significantly strengthened. The Punjab Charities Commission was recognised as the most effective among all provincial commissions.\n\nMr Sukhera and DG Ehsan Sadiq also held a meeting with home secretary Dr Ahmad Javed Qazi.\n\nMr Sukhera assured the issues related to taxation and bank accounts of NGOs would be resolved.
