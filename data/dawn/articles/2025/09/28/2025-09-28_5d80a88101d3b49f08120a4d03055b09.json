Either grant the rights or face the wrath of the people.”\n\nHe said the lockdown was plan A, while the alliance had also prepared plans B and C. “And plan D,” he warned, “is the harshest.”\n\nWhile the government has not publicly outlined its strategy for the Sept 29 event, officials said strict security measures have been established.\n\nOn Saturday, large convoys of vehicles carrying armed police and paramilitary personnel conducted flag marches in almost all district headquarters. Heavy contingents were also deployed at city entry and exit points, with strict surveillance at sensitive sites.\n\nSeparately, traders’ associations announced they would forgo their weekly holiday and keep shops open on Sunday to allow citizens to purchase essential food and household items ahead of the planned lockdown.\n\nAt the Muzaffarabad meeting, Divisional Commissioner Chaudhry Guftar Hussain noted that federal and AJK ministers had already held “open-hearted” dialogue with the JKJAAC but stressed that peace must be ensured collectively. “Disorder and lawlessness benefit no one,” he remarked.\n\nDistrict Magistrate Mudasser Farooq, speaking at the same meeting, warned that no one would be allowed to disrupt public life or free movement.\n\n“Maintaining peace is a shared responsibility of the administration, police, and citizens,” he said. “We have no quarrel with anyone, but our mission of public service will continue at all costs.” He added that safeguarding state property, including vehicles and machinery, was the “foremost duty of all employees.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 28th, 2025",
