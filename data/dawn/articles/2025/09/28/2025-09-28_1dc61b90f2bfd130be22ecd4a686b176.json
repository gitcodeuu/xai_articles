  "content": "Liverpool’s perfect Premier League start came undone in a 2-1 defeat at Crystal Palace on Saturday as Manchester United suffered another setback in losing 3-1 at Brentford.\n\nPalace are now the only undefeated team in the Premier League after extending their club record run to 18 games in all competitions without losing, including three games against Liverpool.\n\n“These are the moments why we love football. The fans will have a great Saturday evening now,” said Palace boss Oliver Glasner.\n\n“We deserved it. Great performance, great game, great win.” The English champions were finally made to pay for another disjointed performance after being bailed out by a series of late goals in winning their opening five league games.\n\nIsmaila Sarr fired the FA Cup winners into an early lead after Liverpool failed to deal with a corner.\n\nLiverpool looked set to be rescued by another late goal when Federico Chiesa swept home a loose ball in the box to equalise on 87 minutes.\n\nThis time, the Reds were on the other end of a late winner.\n\nNketiah produced a composed finish in a packed penalty area with almost the last kick of the game.\n\nVictory takes Palace up to second and within three points of Liverpool at the top of the table.\n\nArsenal can move back into second and cut the gap on their title rivals to two points when they travel to Newcastle on Sunday.\n\nUnited boss Ruben Amorim’s wait for back-to-back Premier League wins goes on, nearly a year into his reign, after a disastrous defensive display at Brentford.\n\nThe Bees had previously won just once since Keith Andrews replaced Tottenham boss Thomas Frank, but the visitors were unable to deal with Brentford’s physical approach.\n\nHarry Maguire’s attempt to play offside cost United the opening goal as Igor Thiago ran clear to smash home.\n\nThiago was the beneficiary of another United error on 20 minutes when he powered into an empty net from goalkeeper Altay Bayindir’s punch back into the danger area.\n\nBenjamin Sesko’s first United goal was the only positive note for Amorim’s men as the Slovenian fired in at the third attempt before half-time. The course of the game could have been very different had Bruno Fernandes not failed to score from the penalty spot for the second time already this season. Fernandes’ spot-kick was saved by Caoimhin Kelleher after Nathan Collins was lucky to avoid a red card for pulling down Bryan Mbeumo. Instead it was Brentford who sealed victory in stoppage time through Mathias Jensen. The Dane’s effort was powerfully hit, but again Bayindir was found wanting to raise further scrutiny on Amorim’s decision to back the Turkish international over new signing Senne Lammens. “We didn’t control the game. We played the game of Brentford,” Amorim said. “All the crucial moments were against us. We need to do better.” Manchester City needed some help from Burnley defender Maxime Esteve, who scored two own goals, in a 5-1 win for Pep Guardiola’s men. Esteve turned into his own net under pressure from Phil Foden after Jeremy Doku’s effort was saved. Against the run of play, Burnley hit back through Jadon Anthony to level before half-time. City were growing frustrated until Matheus Nunes blasted in from Erling Haaland’s knockdown. The unfortunate Esteve turned in Nunes’ cross to make it 3-1. Haaland then struck twice in added time to take his tally for the season to 15 goals in nine games for club and country.\n\nChelsea beaten by Brighton - For the second consecutive weekend, Chelsea were undone by a red card in a 3-1 defeat to Brighton. The Blues deservedly led at half-time through Enzo Fernandez’s header. However, the game changed when Trevoh Chalobah was sent-off on 53 minutes after a VAR review for chopping down Diego Gomez who was racing clear on goal. Brighton made the man advantage count as Danny Welbeck headed in to level before Maxim De Cuyper and Welbeck secured victory in stoppage time. There was also late drama at Elland Road where Bournemouth snatched a point against Leeds thanks to Eli Kroupi’s strike in a 2-2 draw.",
