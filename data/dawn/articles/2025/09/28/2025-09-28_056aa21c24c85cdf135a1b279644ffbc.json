  "content": "ISLAMABAD: World Tourism Day was obse­r­ved on Saturday with a focus on tourism’s potential as an agent of positive change, as UN Tourism (formerly UNWTO) repo­rted strong visitor numbers across Asia-Pacific destinations.\n\nThe theme for this year — “Tourism and Sus­tainable Transformation” — underscored that lasting change must begin with effective governance and people-centred planning.\n\nThe UN body warned that despite tourism’s potential, nearly half of young people in emerging destinations lack the training to participate effectively, and urged governments to prioritise accessible, high-quality education and vocational programmes.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in his message, said tourism is not only an industry for Pakistan, but an expression of its national identity and pride. He called for tourism to be developed as an engine of growth to create jobs for young people.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in his message that tourism strengthens bonds between people and places. “It builds bridges across cultures, preserves traditions and restores cultural heritage. It reminds us of our shared humanity — and the richness of diversity,” he said.\n\nSet to launch Tourism Law Observatory in Middle East\n\n“Yet tourism can also damage the very places and communities it celebrates. As the world faces climate breakdown and rising inequalities, we need bold, urgent, and sustainable action that puts people and planet first,” he said.\n\nUN Tourism said that following a period of rapid growth, Asia and the Pacific suffered the deepest impact on its tourism industry due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, in 2025, the region’s recovery for international tourism arrivals is catching up with the rest of the world due to relaxed visa policies and improved air connectivity.\n\nPakistan has already introduced a substantial change to its visa regime, and tourists from 126 countries can now obtain a visa prior to arrival, valid for 90 days, with no cost. This visa reform aims to promote foreign tourism and increase accessibility to the scenic beauty of Pakistan.\n\nAccording to the ‘World Tourism Barometer’, Asia and the Pacific exceeded the world average in the first half of 2025, with an 11 per cent increase in international tourist arrivals over the same period in 2024, though still 8pc below 2019 levels.\n\nNorth-East Asia led the recovery in the region with 20pc tourism growth in January-June 2025 (compared with 2024), hinting at the important influence of China as the world’s largest tourism source market.\n\nIn the meantime, UN Tourism is set to establish a Tourism Law Observatory for the Middle East. This pioneering initiative will support the development and harmonisation of legal and regulatory frameworks for tourism across the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 28th, 2025",
