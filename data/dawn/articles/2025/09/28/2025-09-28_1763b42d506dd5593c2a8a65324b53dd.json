He said that the victims were identified as Sajad Khan, 18; Nawshad Khan, 13; Faw­ad Khan, 18; and Jawad Khan, 15.\n\nThe official mentioned that 17-year-old Waqas Khan and 15-year-old Attaullah were among the wounded. They were initially taken to the district headquarters hospital in Khar but were later airlifted to a hospital in Peshawar via a specially arranged Frontier Corps North helicopter for adv­anced medical treatment.\n\nLocal political leaders from the ANP, JI, and PTI visited Khar Hospital to donate blood and express solidarity with the families.\n\nPTI MPA Dr Hamidur Rehman said he would press authorities for the early return of displaced residents to their homes.\n\nTalal Chaudhry\n\nMeanwhile, Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry said on Saturday that Pakistan’s response to militancy would be firm, suggesting those “who understand the language of bullets will be explained with bullets” if negotiations with Afghanistan fail to stop cross-border attacks.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference, he described Pakistan’s diplomacy as at a 75-year high and defended ongoing security operations.\n\nMr Chaudhry said terrorism remained the cou­ntry’s biggest challenge and insisted the government was committed to making Pakistan safe for investment.\n\n“Today red carpets are being laid for the prime minister abroad,” he said, contrasting current diplomatic outreach with past isolation. He added that federal and provincial governments must cooperate closely on security.\n\nThe minister accused militants of entering Pakistan from across the border and charged that “80 per cent of terrorist attackers are Afghans”.\n\nMr Chaudhry said the government would streng­then measures to prevent cross-border infiltration, curb sectarian violence and stabilise restive areas.\n\nHe called on all political parties to unite for nat­io­nal development and noted that foreign observers acknow­ledged impro­vements in Pakistan’s security situation.\n\nOn media conduct, he warned journalists again­­st supporting “those who hide behind the guise of journalists” and critici­s­­ed what he described as “false vloggers” who, he said, traded national security for money. He said the government was taking action against such individuals and hinted that laws could be further toughened.\n\nTariq Saeed in Toba Tek Singh also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 28th, 2025",
