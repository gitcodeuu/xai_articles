Stalin told reporters on Sunday that 39 people had died, raising an earlier toll of 36.\n\nNine children were among the dead, he added, announcing a judicial enquiry into the disaster.\n\nState police chief G. Venkataraman said crowds had been waiting for hours under the hot sun without sufficient food and water after the public was informed that Vijay would arrive at the venue by noon.\n\n“The crowds started coming in from 11am. He came at 7:40pm. The people lacked sufficient food and water under the hot sun,” he told reporters.\n\nHe added that 10,000 people were expected, but some 27,000 turned up.\n\nVijay launched his own party in 2024 and has drawn huge crowds at campaign events ahead of state elections due next year.\n\n“I was pushed down by the crowd all of a sudden. There was absolutely no space to move,” B. Kanishka, a survivor, told the Hindu newspaper. “I subsequently fainted.”\n\nOthers said poor organisation and an hour-long wait left people restless before the situation spiralled dangerously out of control.\n\nKarthick, a survivor, told the publication that the situation could have been prevented “if people were not forced to wait for hours together”.\n\n“Poor planning and execution of the programme and lack of police personnel at the spot were also the reasons,” he said.\n\nThe Indian Express newspaper said panic spread after supporters who had climbed onto a tree branch fell onto the crowd below.\n\nIn January, 30 people were killed in a crush at a major religious fair, and last year 121 died during a Hindu prayer meeting in Uttar Pradesh.\n\nIn July last year, 121 people were killed in northern Uttar Pradesh state during a Hindu religious gathering.\n\nAdditional input from Reuters",
