  "content": "WASHINGTON: A lewd note allegedly from Donald Trump wishing late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein happy birthday in 2003 — and alluding to their “wonderful secret” — was released on Monday by Democratic lawmakers, after the US president denied it existed.\n\nDemocrats on the US House Oversight Committee, which is probing the handling of a criminal investigation into the disgraced financier, published the letter on social media after it was delivered by Epstein’s estate.\n\nThe note is situated on the sketched outline of a nude woman, and was allegedly part of a book compiled of letters from Epstein’s friends by his associate Ghislaine Maxwell, for the financier’s fiftieth birthday.­\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 9th, 2025",
