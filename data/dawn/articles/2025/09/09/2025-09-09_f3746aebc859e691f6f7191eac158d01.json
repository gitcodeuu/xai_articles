however, according to Amnesty’s investigation, the previous WMS was replaced by a more advanced system produced by a Chinese company, Geedge Networks.\n\nAmnesty went on to say that the new technology was a commercialised version of China’s “Great Firewall”, which is a censorship tool used by the Chinese government.\n\nThe installation of the system was ensured with the help of various foreign companies, including US-based Niagara Networks, French company Thales, and Chinese company New H3C Technologies, it said.\n\nFurthermore, the report mentioned that the PTA had “blocked more than 1.4 million URLs since the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) was passed in 2016”.\n\nThe rights watchdog noted that the process of blocking and removing content has always been “marked by opacity and arbitrariness”.\n\nIt said that the users were “rarely provided any notice by the PTA” before the blocking of content, and became aware of it only when they were unable to access the said content.\n\nRegarding internet shutdowns, Amnesty noted that “the pattern of shutting down mobile and internet services in the name of maintaining law and order has become a regular occurrence”.\n\nCiting a report by the ‘Keep it On’ coalition, Amnesty said that between 2016 and 2024, Pakistan experienced at least 77 internet shutdown incidents, with 24 of these in 2024 alone.\n\nThese included selective blocking of specific sites or content, and “bandwidth throttling” especially in the time leading up to the 2024 general elections, as well as during virtual rallies held by the PTI.\n\nCiting data from the Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI), Amnesty showcased that “just before the general election on 8 February 2024, OONI measurements confirm that several websites were blocked, including the opposition PTI party website and the PTI candidates’ website, as well as Fact Focus, an investigative news outlet”.\n\nAmnesty said that “this shows that the new firewall is being used effectively by Pakistani telecommunications providers to actively block crucial communication channels.”\n\nRecalling the recent internet shutdown in Balochistan and similar incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Amnesty highlighted that “these shutdowns are often used to disrupt protests and political rallies”.\n\nAs per Amnesty’s assessment, the four companies named in the report — Geedge Networks, Utimaco, Datafusion and Niagara Networks — allegedly “contributed to human rights abuse in Pakistan by facilitating mass surveillance”.\n\n“Mass surveillance and unlawful censorship by the Pakistani authorities represent systemic abuses of fundamental human rights,” the rights body said.\n\nAmnesty called for “urgent action” to prevent any further harm, stressing that the “unchecked digital repression” will limit space for democracy.\n\nWith additional input from Reuters.",
