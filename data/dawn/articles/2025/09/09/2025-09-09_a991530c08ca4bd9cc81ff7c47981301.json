Two of his cabinet colleagues had resigned on “moral grounds” late on Monday.\n\nEarly in the day, Oli had called a meeting of all parties, saying violence was not in the interest of the nation and “we have to resort to peaceful dialogue to find solutions to any problem”. He did not respond directly to the protesters’ complaints about corruption.\n\nBut protesters continued gathering in front of parliament and elsewhere in the capital, Kathmandu, defying an indefinite curfew.\n\nThey set fire to tyres on some roads, threw stones at police in riot gear and chased them through narrow streets.\n\nWitnesses also said protesters were setting fire to the homes of some politicians in Kathmandu, and local media reported that some ministers had been plucked to safety by military helicopters.\n\nThe Singha Durbar area, which houses the Prime Minister’s Office and other ministries as well as Parliament House, and Oli’s private residence, was also set on fire, they said.\n\nFootage circulating on social media showed former prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his wife Arzu Rana, foreign minister under Oli, and Finance Minister Bishnu Paudel being attacked by protesters.\n\nReuters could not immediately verify the information.\n\nKathmandu airport, Nepal’s main international gateway, was closed because of smoke from fires set by protesters, the Civil Aviation Authority said.\n\nOrganisers of the protests, which spread to other cities, have called them “demonstrations by Gen Z”, driven by young people’s widespread frustration with a perceived lack of action to tackle corruption and boost economic opportunities.\n\n“The protest was intended, first and foremost, against the rampant corruption in government,” a protester said in an email to Reuters, signing off as ‘A concerned Nepali citizen’.\n\nYoung Nepalis had been posting on social media about the “luxurious lives of the families and children of corrupt politicians and civil servants” until the government clamped down on the platforms, the email said.\n\nLast week, Oli’s government blocked access to several online platforms for allegedly failing to register with the government, saying social media were being used to spread disinformation and commit fraud.\n\nThe UN rights chief voiced alarm at the escalating violence.\n\nUN High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Turk is “appalled by the escalating violence in Nepal”, his office said in a statement.\n\n“I plead with security forces to exercise utmost restraint, and avoid further such bloodshed and harm,” Turk said. “Violence is not the answer.”\n\nTurk stressed that “dialogue is the best and only way to address the concerns of the Nepalese people”, adding that “it is important that the voices of young people are heard”.\n\nHe said they had the right to peacefully express their frustrations, adding there were “concerning reports of unnecessary and disproportionate use of force by the security forces”.\n\n“I call for urgent, thorough, transparent and impartial investigation into such acts.”\n\nTurk stressed that protesters, too, must refrain from violence.\n\n“I am disturbed by reports of public buildings, businesses and private residences being attacked and, in some instances, set ablaze,” he said.\n\n“Equally, I am concerned by reports of physical attacks on senior government officials,” he added.\n\nTurk said his office stood “ready to support dialogue and trust-building measures that can help de-escalate tensions and restore confidence”.",
