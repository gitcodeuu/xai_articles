However, the provincial government was reportedly hesitant to extend leniency to hardened criminals involved in serious crimes like multiple murders and kidnapping for ransom.\n\nPolice seek equipment, weapons to combat bandits\n\nDuring the KAMC meeting, Additional Inspector General of Police Zubair Nazir Sheikh provided a briefing on the law and order situation and ongoing operations in the Katcha areas. He emphasised the urgent requirement for modern equipment, advanced weapons, and secure vehicles to effectively combat the bandits.\n\nAdditionally, he highlighted the need to enhance facilities at existing checkpoints in the riverine areas and outlined plans to equip police with cutting-edge technology and professional training to boost their capabilities.\n\nThe home minister directed that detailed and practical recommendations for providing necessary resources to the police be submitted promptly.\n\nHe stated that after the construction of bridges at Dadu, Moro, Larkana and Khairpur, crimes had decreased, but it is vital to accelerate work on the Ghotki and Kashmore bridge projects so they are completed at the earliest. The construction of these bridges on this route will also significantly reduce crime.\n\nMr Lanjar also asked the schools & education and health departments about the number of schools, educational institutions, hospitals, and dispensaries in the Katcha areas.\n\nHe said the purpose of this inquiry was to establish temporary campuses during operations to ensure that the provision of education and health facilities does not get interrupted.\n\nHe acknowledged that delays in the past had prevented the operation from being completed but emphasised that the anti-bandit operation must be brought to a successful conclusion under all circumstances.\n\nHe appealed to all stakeholders to demonstrate collective determination and stand as strong partners.\n\nThe meeting was attended, among others, by the IGP Sindh, senior members Board of Revenue, education and law secretaries, representatives of the health and forest departments, Additional IG of CTD and Special Branch, and representatives of Sindh Rangers and other security agencies.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 9th, 2025",
