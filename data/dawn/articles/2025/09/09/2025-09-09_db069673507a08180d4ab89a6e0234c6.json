Bears, almost never.”\n\nYet one key similarity rem­ains — unpredictability.\n\n“You never really know what might happen, or what could trigger ‘wild’ behaviour. We simply don’t know them well enough to anticipate it,” he said.\n\nHuman encroachment\n\nThe Deosai Plains, spanning about 3,600 sq km between Skardu and Astore in the Karakoram range, were declared a national park by the government in 1993. It is home to brown bears, marmots (squirrels), foxes, wolves, over two dozen species of birds and a vibrant variety of alpine flowers.\n\n“If you cast a line in the streams, you will catch a fish within five minutes, and the water is clean enough for drinking,” Zakaria says.\n\nTo manage this unique ecosystem, the Islamabad-based Hi­­malayan Wildlife Founda­ti­­on (IWF) was asked to develop a management plan by the Gil­git-Baltistan Wildlife Depart­ment, marking core zones, grazing areas, camping sites and more.\n\nAs its co-founder, Zakaria has spent over three decades studying brown bears, tracking their movements, population, diet and behaviour — not just in Deosai but around the world — and continues to collaborate with international bear experts.\n\n“In 1993, around 20 jeeps would visit the park every day in summers,” he recalled. By the year 2000, traffic had picked up. Today, up to 500 vehicles enter the park daily during peak season, he added.\n\n“We need to accept that humans are occupying their territory, not the other way around,” he said.\n\nHe also blames people, tourists and locals alike, for altering and even degrading habitats — cutting forests, increasing livestock and then leaving them unattended in open grazing areas, providing easy prey for hungry wild predators.\n\nEmphasising the dangers of habituation, Zakaria said Deosai marmots were routinely being fed by visitors. “You never, never, feed wild animals; that’s the cardinal rule!”\n\nThe HWF had originally advised that no permanent roads or permanent structures be built inside the park, to avoid the kind of irreversible environmental damage seen in Naran, Kaghan and more recently in Nathia Gali.\n\n“But now with traffic hundred times higher, we may need hard top roads to reduce dust, noise and vehicles getting stuck in snow and for them not to go astray and remain in the designated area.\n\nHe also stressed the need for better campsite management, garbage disposal and upgraded restaurants, adding that education will have a key role to play in any betterment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 9th, 2025",
