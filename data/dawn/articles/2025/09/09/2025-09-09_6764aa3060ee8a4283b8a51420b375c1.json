Throwing pigs’ heads at worshippers or physically assaulting them?”\n\nOutside one of the affected mosques, a 40-year-old former association director, who spoke on condition of anonymity, laid flowers to show “solidarity and support”.\n\n“People shouldn’t have to hide their faith,” she said.\n\nSimilar incidents have targeted mosques and Muslim associations elsewhere in France in recent years, including a pig’s head left outside a Muslim association in the northern Pas-de-Calais region in 2024.",
