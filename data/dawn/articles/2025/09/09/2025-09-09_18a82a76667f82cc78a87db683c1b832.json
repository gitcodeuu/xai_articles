A police official said that police and counter-terrorism units encountered terrorists near the Mangala forest during a search and strike operation.\n\n“When the law enforcers reached near the forest, they saw eight to ten terrorists armed with advanced weapons,” he said.\n\nThe militants fired at police, triggering a half-hour gunfight. Afterward, two terrorists were found dead, while others fled into the dark forest.\n\nThe law enforcers seized arms and ammunition and shifted the bodies to the THQ Hospital in Serai Naurang town.\n\nAlso in Lakki Marwat, two relatives of a police official were wounded when terrorists attacked his home in the Mir Qalam Pull area.\n\nHead constable Sanaullah said in a preliminary report that his family awoke to dogs barking at midnight. When his brother, Rafaqatullah, 22, and wife, Rehana Bibi, 40, went outside their rooms, gunfire erupted.\n\n“In the meanwhile, an intense firing started and he immediately took position in the rooftop watchtower,” Sanaullah said.\n\nHe saw armed men firing, injuring his brother and wife. He returned fire for twenty minutes, causing the attackers to flee. The injured were taken to a Bannu hospital, and search for the assailants was underway.\n\nMeanwhile, six suspected bandits injured three motorcyclists near Pasani under Serai Gambila police jurisdiction on Sunday night. Victims were riding a motorcycle when the bandits signalled them to stop with a torch. Upon not stopping, the bandits opened fire.\n\nThe injured were taken to THQ Hospital in Serai Naurang, and a case was filed against the unidentified attackers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 9th, 2025",
