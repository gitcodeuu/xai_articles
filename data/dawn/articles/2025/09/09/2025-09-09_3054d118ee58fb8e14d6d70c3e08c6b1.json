A senior police official was also taken to hospital with bullet injuries, officials said.\n\nWorkers and supporters of the Tehreek-i-Tahaffuz-i-Ayeen-i-Pakistan alliance blocked all national highways at different entry points, putting up barricades and big boulders in the morning to block all types of traffic. Transporters’ associations had already announced support for their protest.\n\nLikewise, trade activities between Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran were suspended due to the strike. Not a single truck or other vehicle crossed into the border towns of Chaman and Taftan due to the blockade on highways linking Balochistan with Afghanistan and Iran.\n\nThe airport and rail services, however, remained operational under the watchful eye of security personnel.\n\nBesides roads and trade, businesses also remained shut and the supporters of the opposition parties patrolled the business hubs of the provincial capital, seemingly to enforce the strike.\n\nClashes erupted in the areas of Sariab, Airport Road, Pashtunabad, Nawa Killi, and Jinnah Road when police attempted to remove blockades from main roads.\n\nPolice removed the hurdles and did not allow the alliance workers to block intra-city roads.\n\nThe protesters, however, managed to block the Western and Eastern bypasses for a brief period, but police dispersed them by firing tear gas.\n\nOn Airport Road too, police fired in the air to disperse protesters who were blocking the road, while clashes were also reported from Sariab Road.\n\nSSP Mohammad Baloch told Dawn that those detained had been sent to the district jail.\n\nPkMAP Secretary General Abdul Rahim Ziaratwal, ex-MNA Abdul Qahar Wadan, BNP-Mengal leader Mir Naseer Ahmed Shahwani and others were also arrested by the police.\n\nPrivate educational institutions, including schools and colleges, remained closed due to the protest.\n\nHowever, government-run educational institutions and offices remained open, but very few employees could reach the secretariat and other offices due to low traffic.\n\n60 arrested across province\n\nIn other parts of the province, over 60 people were arrested for violating Section 144, blocking the highways, and clashing with the security forces. The wheel-jam and shutter-down strike was also observed in Loralai, Zhob, Sibi. Nasirabad, Khuzdar, Kalat, Harnai, Mastung, Hub Bela, Kharan, Noshki, Qila Saifullah, Turbat, Panjgur, Gwadar, Dera Murad Jamali and other towns and cities. “Around 60 people were arrested in these towns,” said officials.\n\nIn KP, the opposition parties, as well as the ruling PTI, also organised demonstrations across the province.\n\nThe strike call was given by PkMAP, BNP, the PTI, the ANP, the National Party, and the MWM at a joint presser last week to protest the Sept 2 suicide bombing.\n\nSardar Akhtar Mengal, Mehmood Khan Achakzai, former senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi, and ANP leader Asghar Achakzai remained unhurt in the attack as they had left just a few minutes before.\n\nPress conference\n\nAddressing the media at the Quetta Press Club on Monday evening, PkMAP’s Lala Abdul Rauf, BNP’s Sajid Tareen Advocate, ANP’s Asghar Achakzai, National Party’s Aslam Baloch, Jamaat-e-Islami’s Zahid Akhtar, and PTI’s Dawood Shah Achakzai condemned what they called the government’s attempts to sabotage their strike. They decried baton charge, tear gas shelling, and mass arrests of peaceful protesters and announced a plan to hold more protest rallies.\n\nThe leaders announced that protests will be held on Sept 11 in front of press clubs across Balochistan, while a meeting of senior leaders has been scheduled for Sept 13 to finalise the alliance’s future course of action. They warned that if political workers and leaders detained across the province were not released, a tougher line of action would be announced at the Sept 13 meeting.\n\nFormer governor Malik Abdul Wali Kakar, Akhtar Hussain Langove, Shafqaat Langove, Jameel Mashwani, Abdul Hameed Mansoori, Mir Ghulam Nabi Marri, Kabir Afghan, and Ismatullah were also present at the press conference.\n\nBehram Baloch, Ali Jan Mangi, and Abdul Wahid Shahwani also contributed\n\nPublished in Dawn, September 9th, 2025",
