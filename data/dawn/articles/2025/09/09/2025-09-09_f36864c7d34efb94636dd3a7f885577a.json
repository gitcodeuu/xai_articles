It would continue to move nearly west/ southwest-ward and gradually further weaken into a well-marked low pressure area during next 12 hours, the PMD added.\n\n“Due to this system strong monsoon currents are continually penetrating in the province. Under its influence, widespread rain-wind/ thundershower with strong gusty winds along with scattered heavy to very heavy/ isolated exceptional heavy falls are expected in … Karachi division till tomorrow with occasional gaps.”\n\nThe Met Office warned that “torrential rains” could cause urban flooding and water logging in low-lying areas of Karachi.\n\nA day earlier, Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) focal person Anjum Nazeer Zaigham said that “heavy to very heavy” rain was expected in the city today in four to six spells from the morning till night.\n\nThree people lost their lives in rain-related incidents, which included 2 teenagers who lost their lives due to electrocution during the downpour.\n\nPolice surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed told Dawn.com that two teenagers whose cause of death was electrocution were brought from Sohrab Goth and Khawaja Ajmer Nagri, respectively, at Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for legal formalities.\n\nSohrab Goth police SHO Mumtaz Marwat told Dawn.com that Waseem Noor, 17, died when he suffered an electric shock at a water filter plant in Ayub Goth.\n\nKhawaja Ajmer Nagri police station SHO Sarfraz Commando told Dawn.com that 18-year-old Mustaqeem Saeed died of an electric shock inside a home in Rasheedabad.\n\nA young man drowned in rain-filled Malir Nadi (river) while another was rescued on Tuesday evening, according to officials.\n\nRescue-1122 spokesperson Hassaan Ul Haseeb Khan said that two men were trying to cross the Malir Nadi at Yar Mohammed Goth.\n\nThere was a heavy flow of water because of the accumulation of rainwater apart from quicksand. They were stuck up in it.\n\nThe feet of one of the victims, identified as Ali Gul Mithani was stuck in quicksand who controlled himself with the help of something and was rescued, while a heavy flow of water took away another man, namely Irfan Ahmed Tarin, 27.\n\nThe rescue team continued the operation till late evening but could not find him.\n\nMeanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah directed Malir deputy commissioner for personal supervision of the operation. He directed the DC to inform residents in adjoining areas of Malir river for situations developing there due to rain and ensure the protection of life and property.\n\nLater, K-Electric issued a statement maintaining that preliminary investigations showed its “infrastructure was not involved” in either of the incidents.\n\nOn the directives of the Sindh CM, rescue teams were dispatched to Khameso Jokhio Goth in Malir after rain and overflowing water from the Malir River entered residential areas.\n\nActing on the chief minister’s instructions, Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah directed the commissioner to mobilise Rescue 1122, according to the CM’s spokesperson.\n\nThe Malir DC also proceeded to the affected site.\n\nThe CM instructed officials to ensure full assistance for the residents and ordered that all villagers be shifted to safe locations.\n\nEarlier, the city’s traffic police took the pre-emptive measure of declaring both sides of Tariq Road “no-parking zone”.\n\nThe traffic police posted on X that the Met Office had predicted heavy rain and urban flooding for September 9 (today), in view of which “citizens, as well as all market associations, their members, and administrations are informed that both sides of Tariq Road have been declared no-parking zone”.\n\nThe police said the step was taken so that Tariq Road could be used as an alternative route in case Sharea Faisal, one of the city’s main arteries, “is affected”.\n\n“Citizens, especially market associations and members, are requested to avoid parking on both sides of Tariq Road so that traffic flow is not hampered.”\n\nEarlier in the morning, the traffic police reported drizzle in parts of the city. It advised commuters to exercise caution and warned them of slippery roads.\n\nThe traffic police also advised people against travelling to low-lying areas.\n\nMeanwhile, Karachi Additional Inspector General of Police Javed Alam Odho instructed zonal deputy inspector generals and district senior superintendent of police to brief their subordinates and relevant officials about assistance that was to provide in case of rain. He also directed them to coordinate with all relevant departments.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the police, he further asked them to inform the residents of low-lying areas, especially those living alongside rivers and nullahs, about the weather situation so that precautionary measures could be taken.\n\n“All possible cooperation with the traffic police should be ensured,” he said, adding that alternative routes to the ones affected by rain should be checked.\n\nMeanwhile, a statement issued by the Chief Minister’s (CM) House said the city administration was put on alert on the directives of CM Murad Ali Shah.\n\nIt quoted Sindh Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah as saying that district administrations and local body departments should “go out in the field” to assist citizens and stay prepared for the rain spell.\n\nHe directed assistant commissioners and municipal commissioners to check the drainage of nullahs, adding that arrangements should be made for having equipment required for rainwater drainage.\n\n“Machines provided by the PDMA (provincial disaster management authority) should be ready for drainage.”\n\nOn Monday, Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab addressed a press conference, where he detailed precautionary measures taken in view of the rain forecast.\n\nHe said that despite precautionary measures, it was inevitable the city would take “a few hours” to recover after each downpour .\n\nOutlining the city’s preparedness, limitations and political landscape amid the ongoing monsoon spell predicted to continue through Sept 8-10.\n\n“The sea level is high — it might not take the water,” he explained, adding that this natural phenomenon was among the city’s biggest challenges during heavy rainfall.\n\nHighlighting the city’s preparedness, the mayor claimed that all 46 major drains (nullahs) under Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) leading to the sea had been “cleaned”, including the Gujjar, Orangi and Mehmoodabad nullahs.\n\n“Additional pumps have been installed, machinery deployed, and 120 water and sewerage vehicles are active across the city,” he said.\n\nRelief camps have been set up at key choke points to provide stranded citizens with water and biscuits, and municipal staff leave has been cancelled to ensure 24/7 field presence.\n\nThe mayor urged residents to remain calm and patient, advising them not to rush out during the rain.\n\nLast month, 15 people were killed as rains had severely strained Karachi’s fragile infrastructure, causing stormwater drains and sewers to burst, and also disrupting industrial operations across the economic hub. Several areas experienced extended power and internet service outages, which continued late into the day, disrupting everyday life and adding to citizens’ misery.\n\nMost of the deaths occurred due to collapsing structures, drowning and electrocution during the three days of rain, according to hospital officials.",
