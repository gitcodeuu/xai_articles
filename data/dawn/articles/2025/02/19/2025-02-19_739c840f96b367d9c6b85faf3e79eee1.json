In two separate incidents in April 2024, nine people were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while two labourers from Punjab were shot in Kech.\n\nIn May last year, seven barbers from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw 23 travellers offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.\n\nNo group has claimed responsibility for the attack so far.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2025",
