Using footage from CCTV, along with human intelligence and other technical methods, the suspects were traced and apprehended during the raid.\n\n“The suspects will be charged with solid evidence and given exemplary punishment,” CPO Hamdan was quoted as saying.\n\nIn April last year, a staffer from the Swiss embassy and five other people were robbed and held hostage in Islamabad for six hours, being forced to bring more money from an automated teller machine.\n\nAccording to police, a foreign woman and five Pakistani associates had parked vehicles near Shah Allah Ditta, within the limits of Golra police station, and started biking towards a stupa located in the limits of Taxila.\n\nIn February 2021, Racecourse Police in Lahore booked two suspects for allegedly kidnapping two foreigners for ransom of Rs300 million.\n\nThe suspects nominated in the first information report (FIR) obtained Rs10.4m from Stephen Ehrhardt, a Swiss citizen and Magerwin Maria Spari of Germany, releasing them on the condition that they would manage the remaining amount.",
