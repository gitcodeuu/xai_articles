Kabul denies the allegations.\n\nA UN report on Saturday revealed that the Afghan Taliban’s continued support for the banned TTP, despite Islamabad’s increasing pressure to cease backing the outfit, was fuelling the group’s escalating attacks in Pakistan.\n\nEarlier, Dar underscored that terrorism remained a significant impediment to strengthening ties with Afghanistan, stating, “Terror­ism is a major irritant in our relationship [with Kabul]”.\n\nGuterres appreciated Pakistan’s role towards the maintenance of international peace and security in the form of its UN Peacekeeping contributions, state media Radio Pakistan reported.\n\nDar reaffirmed strong support for the UN’s role in addressing global challenges, including peace and security, development and climate change. He also underscored Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to promoting international peace, and security as a non-permanent member of the UNSC.\n\nThe minister welcomed the UN Secretary General’s initiative to organise the Summit of the Future, expressing the hope that the Pact for the Future will be fully implemented, fulfilling the financing needs of the developing countries to implement the SDGs and climate goals.\n\nDar also called for a resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute under Security Council resolutions.\n\nWhile condemning Israel’s assault against the Palestinians, he reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering support for a two-state solution.",
