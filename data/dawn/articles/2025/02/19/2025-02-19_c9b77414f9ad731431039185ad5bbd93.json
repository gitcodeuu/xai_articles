He called on international sta­­keholders to invest in Gwadar’s lo­­gistics, energy, and industrial sectors. “CPEC is not just an economic corridor; it is a lifeline for Balochistan,” he said.\n\nSays Gwadar now transformed into regional trade hub\n\nSenator Mushahid Hus­sain Sayed, chairman of the Pakistan-China Insti­tute, highlighted Pak­is­t­an’s role as a connectivity hub linking South Asia, China, Central Asia, and the Gulf. He cited CPEC’s success, which has attra­cted $26 billion in investments, as a driving force behind Pakistan’s economic transformation.\n\nHe also pointed to Quaid-i-Azam’s vision of Pakistan as the pivot of the world while acknowledging challenges such as the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and projected population growth, which could reach 350 million by 2050.\n\nHe identified three emerging realities influencing Pakistan’s reg­i­onal connectivity: emergence of Gwadar as a regional hub, shifts in Sou­­th Asia, and evolving global dy­­n­amics following new US administration under President Donald Trump taking office in Washington DC.\n\nMinister of State for Finance Ali Pervez Malik emphasised the need for deeper economic integration and highlighted Pakistan’s role as a trade and investment bridge between East and West.\n\nFormer US Assistant Secretary of State Robin Raphel underscored Pakistan’s strategic location as crucial for securing supply chains across Asia and Europe.\n\nThe conference also marked the launch of the book Karot Hydropower Project Insights & Success, documenting Pakistan’s first large-scale CPEC hydropower project. The Pakistan-China Institute unveiled two reports: ‘CPEC: Fact vs Fiction’ and ‘The Religious Tourism Supply Chain Along the Sukkur-Multan Motorway in Pakistan: A Case Study’.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2025",
