In the operation, three attackers were killed by the police while the search for the remainder was still underway at the time of going to press.\n\nThe terrorists left behind three hand grenades, seven Kalashn­ikovs, and hundreds of cartridges.\n\nAbdul Sami Paracha in Kohat also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2025",
