The group has since grown to also include South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nTrump has repeatedly warned the Brics not to challenge the dominance of “the mighty US dollar”, and threatened members with a 100 per cent tariff “if they want to play games with the dollar”.\n\nBut Brazil last week joined the ranks of Latin American states to back down to one of Trump’s demands — nixing plans to advance a common currency while it holds the Brics presidency, lest it triggers a backlash from Trump.\n\nChina, Brazil’s largest export market, buys almost $70bn more from Latin America’s biggest economy than the US does, according to UN Comtrade data, but still does not want to put the $37bn worth of goods it does sell to the American market on the line.\n\nTrump has not held back on threatening to up-end trade ties with the region while China looks to cultivate deeper strategic partnerships with individual Latin American nations, offering the region an alternative pole of economic support.\n\nHe has also threatened Mexico and Colombia with punitive trade remedies if they did not take stronger action to curb illegal immigration into the US.\n\nMexico agreed to reinforce its northern border with 10,000 National Guard members to stem the flow of illegal migrants and drugs.\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro backed down from a decision to turn away US military planes carrying deported migrants, pulling it back from the brink of a trade war with its biggest export market.",
