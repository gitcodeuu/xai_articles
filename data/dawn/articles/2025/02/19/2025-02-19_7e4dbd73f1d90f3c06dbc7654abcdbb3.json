However, the time period was reduced to 120 days and then to 100 days but it was completed in just 84 days, he added.\n\nMr Naqvi said that this project was much needed as people had been facing traffic congestion at this junction.\n\nHe said the CDA was also going to start massive tree plantation campaign in Islamabad to make the city greener. He said that Islamabad is also facing low level smog issue and with tree plantation, this issue would be addressed.\n\nMeanwhile, massive traffic congestion was witnessed at Jinnah Avenue and its flyover portion putting hundreds of motorists in trouble after a large number of motorists moved towards the interchange after coming to know that the project had been inaugurated and opened to traffic.\n\nLater the CDA removed the marquee, which had been set up for the opening ceremony and boulders in the area and entire project was opened for traffic.\n\n“The road has been opened to all types of traffic and there is no traffic congestion. There was a traffic mess in the evening, but all hurdles have been removed, and the traffic congestion issue at this junction has been resolved for good,” the CDA spokesperson, Shahid Kiani, said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2025",
