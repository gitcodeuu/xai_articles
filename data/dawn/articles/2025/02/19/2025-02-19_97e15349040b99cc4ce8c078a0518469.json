Over the years, the two countries’ militaries have maintained robust cooperation, particularly in the domains of counterterrorism and professional training, the statement noted.\n\nGen Munir will also visit prominent units of the British Army, including the Land Warfare Centre and the 1st Strike Brigade, where he will receive briefings on the UK Army’s modernisation initiatives and operational strategies.\n\nThe visit underscores the enduring partnership between Pakistan and the United Kingdom, reaffirming their shared commitment to regional stability and global peace.\n\nThe army chief met his British counterpart General Sir Patrick Sanders in May last year where both sides discussed measures to further elevate bilateral defence relations.\n\nEarlier, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb expressed the desire to work for more robust relations with the UK during a meeting with British Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for Middle East, Pakistan and Afghanistan Hamish Falconer in Portugal.",
