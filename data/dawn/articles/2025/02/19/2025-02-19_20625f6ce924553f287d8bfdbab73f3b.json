Of the children under 10 who crossed the border, 502 had received polio vaccination.\n\nThe biweekly report said that 10pc of the returnee households were women-headed households, adding that no child-headed households were recorded during the said period. More men (52 per cent) than women (48 per cent) returned during the reporting period.\n\nAgency says over 18,000 Afghans repatriated last month, majority between 18 and 59 years of age\n\nAccording to the report, fear of arrest (78 per cent) and inability to pay house rent (34 per cent) are the most common reasons for the return cited among the heads of households returning to Afghanistan.\n\nThe inability to pay household utilities (30 per cent), no employment (26 per cent), and communal pressure to return (9 per cent) were also cited among reasons. It noted that the fear of arrest and communal pressure to return have both increased in the past two weeks.\n\nFinal destination\n\nOn the other hand, 89 per cent of Afghans have reported family reunions as the reason for choosing their final destination and 67 per cent noted the availability of assistance in Afghanistan as another reason. At least 17pc of returnees also indicated that they wanted to obtain nationality in Afghanistan.\n\nDuring the interviews, a large majority of respondents reported finding income opportunities (98 per cent), arranging for livelihoods (89 per cent), resettlement in a new city (87 per cent), and shelter (71 per cent) as the most important challenges they foresee upon return in Afghanistan.\n\nA relatively lower percentage of respondents identified the availability of medicine and health facilities (36 per cent), access to education (35 per cent), and availability of clean drinking water (32 per cent) as their primary challenges. Only a small number of respondents identified security (8 per cent) as a challenge.\n\nOn average, returnees pay $153 from their place of origin in Pakistan to their final destination in Afghanistan. The cost from the border to their final destination in Afghanistan ($86) is higher than the cost from their place of origin in Pakistan to the border ($67), said the report, adding that the majority used pick-ups (67 per cent) and trucks (18 per cent) to travel to their final destination.\n\nAll Afghan returnees reported moving with personal belongings. “Ninety-seven per cent reported carrying cash, followed by household items (95 per cent) and productive assets (53 per cent),” the report said.\n\nThe IOM said that the majority of returnees came from Balochistan (43 per cent), followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (28 per cent) and Sindh (20 per cent). A small share also came from Punjab (7 per cent) and ICT (2 per cent). The districts of origin in Pakistan are usually located close to the border, such as Quetta (24 per cent) and Killa Abdullah (10 per cent).\n\nA substantial share of returnees also come from Karachi (20 per cent) and Peshawar (19 per cent), which are located far away from the border in Sindh and KP, respectively. In Afghanistan, most returnees also go to provinces that are located closer to the border, including Kandahar (32 per cent), Nangarhar (23 per cent) and Kabul (13 per cent).\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2025",
