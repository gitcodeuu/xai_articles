  "content": "CAIRO: Egypt’s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi is expected to travel to Riyadh on Thursday, two Egyptian security sources said, where he is due to discuss an Arab plan for Gaza that may include up to $20 billion from the region for reconstruction.\n\nArab states are expected to discuss a post-war plan for Gaza to counter US President Donald Trump’s proposal to redevelop the strip under US control and displace Palestinians, a prospect that has angered regional leaders.\n\nSaudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar are set to review and discuss the Arab plan in Riyadh before it is presented at a scheduled Arab summit which takes place in Cairo on March 4, four sources with knowledge of the matter said.\n\nHowever, according to an assessment released by the United Nations, the European Union and the World Bank on Tuesday, more than $50 billion will be required to rebuild Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe Interim Rapid Damage and Needs Assessment said that $53.2 billion is needed for recovery and reconstruction over the next ten years, with $20 billion needed in the first three.\n\nWB joint assessment says over $50bn needed to rebuild the devastated territory\n\nOn Friday, a gathering of Arab state leaders, including Jordan, Egypt, the UAE and Qatar, was expected in Saudi Arabia, which is spearheading Arab efforts on Trump’s plan, although some sources said the date had not been confirmed yet.\n\nArab states were dismayed by Trump’s plan to “clean out” Palestinians from Gaza and resettle most of them in Jordan and Egypt, to create a Middle East Riviera. The idea was immediately rejected by Cairo and Amman and seen in most of the region as deeply destabilising.\n\nThe Arab proposal, mostly based on an Egyptian plan, involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas involvement and international participation in reconstruction without displacing Palestinians abroad.\n\nA $20 billion contribution from Arab and Gulf states towards the fund, cited by two sources as being a likely figure, may be a good incentive for Trump to accept the plan, Emirati academic Abdul­khaleq Abdullah said. “Trump is transactional so $20 billion would resonate well with him,” Abdullah said. “This would benefit a lot of US and Israeli companies,” he added.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority’s cabinet said in a statement on Tuesday that the first phase of the plan under discussion would cost approximately $20 billion over three years. Egyptian sources said discussions are still under way as to the size of the financial contribution by the region. The plan sees reconstruction taking place over a three-year timeframe, sources said.\n\n“My conversations with Arab leaders, most recently King Abdullah, have convinced me they have a really realistic appraisal of what their role should be,” Senator Richard Blumenthal told reporters in Tel Aviv during a visit to Israel on Monday.\n\nIsraeli foreign minister Gideon Saar said Israel was waiting to evaluate the plan as it comes together but warned that any plan in which Hamas continued to have presence in Gaza was not acceptable. “When we hear it we will know how to address it,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 19th, 2025",
