The visit of Crown Prince Sheikh Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan demonstrates [the] commitment of two countries to elevate the mutual cooperation, reflective of growing partnership and robust people-to-people linkages,” the statement concluded.\n\nOn February 11, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met with UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan at Qasr Al Shati in Abu Dhabi, the FO had said in a statement, adding that both leaders stressed the need for further strengthening the brotherly ties between the two countries.\n\n“The talks emphasised cooperation in economic, trade, and development fields, alongside other areas that align with both nations’ visions for sustainable economic growth and prosperity,” it said, agreeing to make 2025 “a year of action”.",
