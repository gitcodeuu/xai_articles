  "content": "QUETTA / DERA MURAD JAMALI: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has criticised PTI leader Omar Ayub Khan for his “irresponsible and non-serious” statement on law and order in the province.\n\nWhile talking to reporters during his visit to Jaffarabad on Tuesday, the CM refuted Mr Ayub’s claim about “separatist movements in six districts of Balochistan”.\n\n“There is no truth [in these remarks], and all statements are false, baseless and propaganda, CM Bugti said and invited Mr Ayub to visit any districts in the province. “I am ready to take him to every district of Balochistan.”\n\nHe said Mr Ayub’s remarks were “rhetoric” that only “adds fuel to the fire at a time when the province was already facing multiple challenges”.\n\nCM Bugti rebuffs PTI leader’s statement as rhetoric\n\nThe CM said talks about separatist movements were “mere lies” and “have no connection to reality”.\n\nDuring his visit, CM Bugti met with tribal elders and local leaders who played a key role in resolving a long-standing tribal dispute among Bugti clans.\n\nThe two-decade-old conflict was settled through mutual understanding, the CM added.\n\n“Balochistan is a province that values its traditions,” the CM said, stressing that all tribal conflicts should be resolved through consensus, as peace and stability are prerequisites for development.\n\nHe noted that similar tribal disputes had recently been resolved in Sui and other areas, with local leaders playing an active role in ensuring harmony.\n\n‘Inflammatory statement’\n\nMeanwhile, Shahid Rind, the Balochistan government spokesperson, has called Mr Ayub’s remarks “misleading and inflammatory”.\n\nMr Rind said the PTI leader’s comments were “factually incorrect and aimed at misleading the public”.\n\n“The narrative of separatism is nothing but baseless propaganda. Balochistan is and will remain an integral part of Pakistan.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
