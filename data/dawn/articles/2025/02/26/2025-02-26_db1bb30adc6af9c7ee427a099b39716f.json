  "content": "SAHIWAL: Police booked 11 persons, including the bridegroom and two women of his family, late on Monday night following a fight at a walima function leaving three men injured, as the bride’s widow mother could not give a car in the dowry.\n\nAccording to police sources, a valima function was going on in a private marriage hall located in Shadab Town in the city, when the groom, Arsalan, and his family started taunting the bride Sana’s mother, Riffat Parveen, for not giving a car in the dowry.\n\nThe sources say that the husband of Riffat, a resident of 90/9-L village, Muhammad Younis, was a police employee, who was martyred in a bomb blast many years ago. However, the widow somehow arranged a dowry worth Rs2 million for her daughter, including furniture, mobile phones and costly wristwatches for the bridegroom and his family members.\n\nOn being taunted by the groom, Riffat explained that as her husband had died it was not possible for her to give a car in the dowry. This enraged Arslan, who threatened to divorce Sana over the issue.\n\nThis also infuriated the bride’s family, leading to an exchange of hot words and a scuffle between men and women from both sides.\n\nAs per eyewitnesses, Arsalan, along with his brothers Shahzad and Shahid, and sisters Shazai and Guriya, grabbed his mother-in-law by her hair and dragged her through the marriage hall and tore her clothes.\n\nReacting to torture, Riffat’s nephews and other relatives started throwing plates and spoons at the rival party.\n\nThe situation escalated further when Arsalan allegedly fled with Rs300,000 cash, two mobile phones, and two costly wristwatches.\n\nDuring the altercation, three men — Shahid, Sabtain, and Ramzan — were seriously injured and were shifted to the Sahiwal Teaching Hospital.\n\nWhen Ghala Mandi police were called to the scene, the bridegroom’s family and relatives had already fled.\n\nThe police registered a case against 11 individuals, including the bridegroom, two women, and six unknown persons under sections 149, 148, 354, and 382 of the PPC on the complaint of Riffat Parveen and started investigation, without any arrest so far.\n\nARRESTED: Harappa police arrested 19 individuals, while 22 others escaped the scene during a dogfight gambling event between two groups in the village of Murad Kay Katiya, located on the left bank of the River Ravi, on Tuesday.\n\nPolice booked 40 individuals under sections 5 and 7 of The Punjab Prevention of Gambling Ordinance 1978, based on the complaint filed by Sub Inspector Muhammad Nawaz of Harappa Police Station.\n\nReports indicate that the police received a tip-off about a large-scale dog fighting event being held between two groups led by Allah Dita and Fakhar Zaman Mohal.\n\nMore than 150 spectators, along with three dozen dogs and their owners, were involved in the gambling activities. During the police raid, all participants attempted to flee in different directions. However, the police managed to apprehend 19 individuals and booked 22 unidentified persons.\n\nAdditionally, the police recovered cash and seized seven vehicles, including cars and dallas, from the scene.\n\nAmong those arrested are Nouman, Ashfaq, Mukhtiar, Munir, Muhammad Waseem, Luqman, Shahzad, Imtiaz, and others. It is reported that the gamblers hailed from Okara, Pakpattan, Bahawalnagar, and Sahiwal.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
