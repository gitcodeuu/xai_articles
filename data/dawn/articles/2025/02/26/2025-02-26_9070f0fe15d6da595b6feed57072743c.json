He also did not provide details about when exactly the British firm restarted its hunt.\n\nThe Malaysian government said in December it had agreed to launch a new search for MH370.\n\nThe Boeing 777 carrying 239 people disappeared from radar screens on March 8, 2014, while en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.\n\nTwo-thirds of the passengers were Chinese, while the others included Malaysians, Indonesians and Australians, as well as Indian, American, Dutch and French nationals.\n\nThe plane has never been found despite the largest search in aviation history.\n\n“We’re very relieved and pleased that the search is resuming once again after such a long hiatus,” Malaysian Grace Nathan, 36, who lost her mother on the doomed jet, said.\n\nJaquita Gonzales, 62, wife of MH370 flight supervisor Patrick Gomes, said she hoped the resumption of the search would bring her family much-needed closure.\n\n“We just want to know where it is and what happened,” she said. “Memories come back like yesterday, it’s fresh in our heads.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
