It should be noted that the delegation’s visit was not announced by the US Embassy, which usually issues readouts for meetings organised between US and Pakistani officials.\n\nCrypto council\n\nThe government said it will consider establishing a crypto council, which will serve as a dedicated advisory body comprising key government representatives, regulatory authorities, and industry experts.\n\nThis crypto council will oversee policy development, address regulatory challenges, and ensure that Pakistan’s digital asset ecosystem evolves in a secure, compliant, and sustainable manner. The council will also collaborate with friendly countries to develop standardised frameworks for international digital economic engagement, the statement said.\n\nUntil last year, the government and the central bank had been opposed to the idea, with one previous finance minister declaring that cryptocurrencies would never be legalised in the country, while the SBP had warned the public against such transactions.\n\nHowever, Finance Minister Aurangzeb took a fresh stance on Monday when for the first time he publicly called for looking at the option with an ‘open mind’ as a precursor to the formal discussions on the subject with the foreign delegation.\n\nAn official statement said the participants discussed the global evolution of cryptocurrency, its increasing adoption, and the regulatory frameworks being implemented internationally, in line with the US government policies. The deliberations focused on financial security, risk mitigation, and the potential impact of digital assets on Pakistan’s economy, the statement said.\n\nMr Aurangzeb stressed the importance of a well-regulated digital asset framework, aligning Pakistan with international best practices and complying with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) guidelines. He highlighted the government’s commitment to exploring digital assets and integrating blockchain technology as part of its broader strategy to modernise the financial sector.\n\nDiscussions also included “the tokenisation of key infrastructure and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) assets, allowing for increased liquidity, broader investor participation, and greater efficiency in capital markets”.\n\nIt was noted that various stakeholders, including foreign and domestic investors, have already developed product-ready digital asset solutions that could be explored within a regulatory sandbox.\n\nThe government confirmed Pakistan currently has over 20 million active users in the digital asset market who face significant challenges, including high transaction fees. The minister reaffirmed his commitment to regulating and encouraging this industry by adopting appropriate frameworks, laws, and incentives to ensure transparency and facilitate digital business growth.\n\nHe directed relevant stakeholders to formulate a comprehensive framework that ensures security, transparency, regulatory compliance, and economic viability while safeguarding against financial crimes and illicit activities. He also stressed the need for a balanced approach — one that encourages innovation and investment in digital assets while maintaining strict regulatory oversight in line with international standards.\n\nThe meeting concluded with a consensus on adopting a cautious yet forward-looking approach, ensuring that future developments in the digital asset space align with national interests, FATF guidelines, and global financial standards.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
