This is going to take time.”\n\nThe deal, which included the release of 33 Israeli prisoners in return for some 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from some of their positions in Gaza, has survived numerous hiccups. So far, 29 Israeli prisoners, plus five Thais, have been released in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian detainees.\n\nThere is now a standoff over the release of more than 600 Palestinians, which Israel has delayed.\n\nJenin refugee camp\n\nOn the other hand, Israeli bulldozers have demolished large areas of the now virtually empty Jenin refugee camp and appear to be carving wide roadways through its once-crowded warren of alleyways, echoing tactics already employed in Gaza as troops prepare for a long-term stay.\n\nAt least 40,000 Palestinians have left their homes in Jenin and the nearby city of Tulkarm in the northern West Bank since Israel began its operation just a day after reaching a ceasefire agreement in Gaza after 15 months of war.\n\n“Jenin is a repeat of what happened in Jabalia,” said Basheer Matahen, spokesperson for the Jenin municipality, referring to the refugee camp in northern Gaza that was cleared out by the Israeli army after weeks of bitter fighting. “The camp has become uninhabitable.”\n\nHe said at least 12 bulldozers were at work demolishing houses and infrastructure in the camp, once a crowded township that housed descendants of Palestinians who fled their homes or were driven out in the 1948 war in what Palestinians call the ‘Nakba’ or catastrophe at the start of the state of Israel.\n\nHe said army engineering teams could be seen making preparations for a long-term stay, bringing water tanks and generators to a special area of almost one acre in size.\n\nNo comment was immediately available from the Israeli military but on Sunday, Defence Minister Israel Katz ordered troops to prepare for “a prolonged stay”, saying the camps had been cleared “for the coming year” and residents would not be allowed to return.\n\nThe month-long operation in the northern West Bank has been one of the biggest seen since the Second Intifada or uprising by Palestinians more than 20 years ago, involving several brigades of Israeli troops backed by drones, helicopters, and, for the first time in decades, heavy battle tanks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
