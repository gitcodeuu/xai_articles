  "content": "LAHORE: England captain Jos Butt­ler on Tuesday said the “plight of women” in Afghanistan is “saddening”, on the eve of England’s Champions Trophy match against Afghanistan.\n\nAhead of the contest, more than 160 British politicians have called for England to boycott the game in protest against the Taliban government’s restrictions on women’s rights in Afghanistan.\n\n“It’s very saddening the plight of women and girls in Afgha­nistan at the moment and the struggles that they’re facing,” the English skipper said during his press conference in Lahore.\n\n“But we hope that the game tomorrow can be a source of hope and enjoyment.\n\n“It’s obviously a tough time at the moment, so I think we’re really excited about the match,” added the 34-year-old.\n\nFemale participation in sport has effectively been outlawed since the Taliban returned to power in 2021.\n\nThat puts the Afghanistan cricket board at odds with International Cricket Council (ICC) rules, though the men’s team are still allowed to compete.\n\nThe England and Wales Cricket Board resisted the demand to boycott their Champions Trophy group game but said they would not schedule a bilateral series against Afghanistan.\n\n“Sport has a great power to unite people and give hope and that’s what we hope this game will do,” Buttler added.\n\nEarlier, Afghanistan’s English coach told the media that Afghan players are facing a “tricky situation” and know there are “things that are not correct” in their country.\n\n“They know the difference between right and wrong. It is a real tricky situation for them,” head coach and former England batsman Jonathan Trott told the BBC from Lahore.\n\n“They know who they are playing for and representing.\n\n“We work hard to bring joy to the country and the guys are passionate, brave and proud of being able to do that, but knowing full well that there are things that are not correct.”\n\nAfghanistan skipper Hashmatullah Shahidi sidestepped direct questions on Tuesday, during his separate media talk in Lahore, regarding the boycott calls against his team.\n\n“We are cricket players, we are sportsmen,” said Shahidi. “What we control is what we do on the ground, we don’t worry about what is happening off the ground. So our confidence is good.”\n\nLast month South Africa Sports Minister Gayton McKenzie backed demands from British politicians for a playing boycott of Afghanistan.\n\nAustralia which is set to face Afghanistan on Friday have cancelled a T20 International series and a Test against Afghanistan in the last two years, but also plans to play their Champions Trophy game.\n\n“Everyone likes to see everyone play… we are only cricket players we can control things in the ground and we are always trying to give our best when we play,” Shahidi said when asked about support for female cricket.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
