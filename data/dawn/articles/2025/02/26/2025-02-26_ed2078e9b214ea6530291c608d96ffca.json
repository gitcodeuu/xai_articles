Soon after receiving the information, Levies and larger numbers of tribesmen rushed to the site and attempted to chase the kidnappers.\n\nSources said a heavy exchange of fire also took place between the kidnappers and the tribesmen. When the guns fell silent, the car of Hafiz Allahdad and two motorcycles were found in the Jhalar area, which were later impounded, but the kidnappers managed to take away the municipal committee member with them.\n\nSecurity forces along with tribesmen cordoned off the area and intensified efforts for safe recovery of the tribal elder.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
