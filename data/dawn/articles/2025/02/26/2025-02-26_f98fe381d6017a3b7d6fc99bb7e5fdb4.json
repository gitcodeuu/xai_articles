These include:\n\nSwimming (men and women), archery (men and women), athletics (men and women), badminton (men and women), billiards and snooker (Men), boxing (men and women), fencing (men and women), golf (men and women), judo (men and women), karate (men and women), shooting (men and women), squash (men and women), table tennis (men and women), taekwondo (men and women), tennis (men and women), triathlon (men and women), weightlifting (men and women), wrestling (men and women), wushu (men and women), basketball 3x3 and 5x5 (men and women), cricket (men and women), football (men and women), handball (men and women) and beach handball (Men), hockey (Men), mat kabaddi (men and women), rugby (Men), volleyball (men and women) and beach volleyball (Men) and Rowing.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 26th, 2025",
