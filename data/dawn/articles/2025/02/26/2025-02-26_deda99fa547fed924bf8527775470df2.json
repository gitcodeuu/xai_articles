The way to handle pressure in a run-chase,” Buttler said.\n\n“He needed one of the other top six batters to stay in with him and take the game deeper.”\n\nThe pendulum kept swinging as Omarzai dismissed Overton but despite Jofra Archer’s late push England went down as the third team to be eliminated in the eight-nation tournament after hosts Pakistan and Bangladesh.",
