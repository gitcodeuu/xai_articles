Various parts of Swat, Dir Upper, Chitral, Shangla, Mansehra, Battagram, Kohistan, Abbottabad received heavy snowfall while Hunza, Skardu, Ghizar, Diamer and almost all GB districts were covered with a snow blanket as it continued to fall for the third consecutive day which also dropped mercury in the region.\n\nRaja Ashfaq Tahir, spokesperson to Diamer police, told Dawn.com that the KKH was blocked at two different points between Dasu and Diamer with passengers stranded on both sides as work to reopen the road continued.\n\n“Bhasha to Raikot section has been opened which was also blocked last night due to landsliding as rain continues in the area.
