The Met Office recorded 25mm rain at Chaklala and Shamsabad in Rawalpindi; 20mm at Zero Point, 26mm at Saidpur, 8mm at Bokra, 3mm at Islamabad Airport and 27mm at Golra in Islamabad.\n\nAn official at the Met Office said more rains were expected in next 24 hours. A strong westerly wave was affecting most upper parts of the country and may persist till Friday night.\n\nHe said hailstorm was reported in Murree and snowfall in Galliyat. He said that the weather was likely to be clear in most parts of the twin cities on Saturday.\n\nOn the other hand, a school bus and other vehicles remained stuck in traffic due to bad weather in Koza Gali along Barrian Bazaar to Ayubia, Abbottabad Road.\n\nWhen contacted, Murree Deputy Commissioner Agha Zaheer Shirazi said that there was no traffic blockage in Murree district. However, he said traffic stuck in Koza Gali and “we moved traffic police and snow removing vehicles for the help of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.”\n\nHe said that traffic in Murree hill station was normal. However, the administration had directed officials concerned to help the KP administration and “we are in contact with them.”\n\nMeanwhile, District Emergency Officer Mohammad Kamran said Rescue 1122 moved ambulances and other vehicles to the site to restore traffic and provide first aid in case of any need.\n\nOn the other hand, Wasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf said the water level in Leh Nullah was normal but there were reports of water accumulation in some parts of the garrison city.\n\nHe said staff and water sucker machines were stationed at Committee Chowk underpass and other low-lying areas to drain out rainwater. He said there was two spells of rain in the city, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon.\n\nRain comes as a blessing for allergy patients, especially those suffering from flu. With the start of the spring season, the number of pollen allergy patients increases in Rawalpindi and Islamabad.\n\n“During rain, allergy cases usually decrease because rain settled down the dust and clean the atmosphere,” said Dr Azeem Ahmed at Benazir Bhutto Hospital.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
