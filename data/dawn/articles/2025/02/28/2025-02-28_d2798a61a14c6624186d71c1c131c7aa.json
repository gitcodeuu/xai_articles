  "content": "BELGRADE: In a city famed for graffiti and murals, rival exhibitions in Belgrade showcasing the impact of British street artist Banksy have led to a colourful debate over the commercialisation of street art.\n\nBanksy — whose identity is publicly unknown and the subject of feverish speculation — has crossed the globe for decades painting clandestine murals in public spaces, including in the occupied West Bank, London and Los Angeles.\n\nThe artist almost never provides official endorsement for exhibits showcasing his works. But in Belgrade there are two galleries showcasing his work. At one show — simply entitled “Banksy” — the collection mainly features prints and posters, including album covers for various musicians, collaborations with Greenpeace, and an alternative opening sequence for the popular series “The Simpsons”, which the artist adapted.\n\nThere, visitors have flooded social media with pictures taken next to the model of a bomb made famous in several Banksy murals. The show, with entrance tickets costing up to 1,300 dinars ($11.6) has been organised by Slovenia’s Deva Puri Gallery. Curator David Rjazancev, who spent a decade working on the project, which provides visitors with a multimedia tour focusing on Banky’s works.\n\nRjazancev said the exhibition has relied on borrowed artworks from galleries, museums, and private collections after verifying their authenticity. The show has faced some criticism and led to the creation of a rival free exhibition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
