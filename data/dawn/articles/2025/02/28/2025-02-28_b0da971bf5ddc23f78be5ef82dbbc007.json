However, the visibility of the crescent depends on key factors such as the moon’s age, its angular separation from the sun, altitude at sunset, and atmospheric conditions,” Suparco said in a press release.\n\nIt added that the probability of the moon’s visibility on Feb 28 was “not visible even with optical aid”, and thus the likelihood of a moon sighting on the date in Pakistan is “extremely low”.\n\n“Consequently, Sha’aban is expected to complete 30 days, and the first day of fasting will likely be observed on March 2.\n\nHowever, the Pakistan Meteorological Department said on February 7 that the moon would not be sighted on February 28.\n\n“According to astronomical parameters, there is no chance of sighting the new moon of Ramazan … on the evening of 28-02-2025,” the department said in a statement.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the new moon is also expected to be born on Feb 28. However, due to the moon’s position relative to the horizon and atmospheric clarity, the crescent is expected to be visible, leading to the commencement of Ramzan on March 1. In Pakistan, however, it will begin a day later.\n\n“According to astronomical models, the Shawwal moon will be visible on March 30, indicating that Eidul Fitr will likely be observed on March 31 in Pakistan,” the press release said.\n\nSaudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbours announced on Friday that Ramazan would begin on Saturday.\n\nThe kingdom, home to Islam’s two holiest sites, was joined by the United Arab Emirates and Qatar in declaring the sighting of the Ramazan moon.\n\n“The Supreme Court has decided that tomorrow, Saturday, is the first day of the month of [Ramazan],” the official Saudi Press Agency posted on X.\n\nIraq’s top Shia cleric, Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, meanwhile, announced that the holy month would begin on Sunday.\n\nAdditional reporting by Nadir Guramani",
