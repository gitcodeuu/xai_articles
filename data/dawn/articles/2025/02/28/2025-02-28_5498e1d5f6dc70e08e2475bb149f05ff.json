KP recorded the highest number of terrorist incidents in the country in 2024, with 295 attacks.\n\nMeanwhile, attacks by various outlawed Baloch insurgent groups, primarily the Balochistan Liberation Army and the Balochistan Liberation Front, saw a staggering 119pc increase, accounting for 171 incidents in Balochistan, it said.",
