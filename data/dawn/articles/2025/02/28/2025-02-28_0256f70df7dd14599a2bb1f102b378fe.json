  "content": "QUETTA: Former chief minister Dr Abdul Malik Baloch informed the Balochistan Asse­mbly on Thursday that a large number of candidates, who had been shortlisted for vacant posts in the education department, were protesting outside the assembly building due to the non-receipt of appointment letters.\n\nHe urged Speaker Abdul Khaliq Achakzai to form a house committee to hold negotiations with the protesting candidates.\n\nThe candidates, who had been shortlisted after appearing in the test, staged a sit-in outside the Balochistan Assembly, holding placards and banners with their demands. They chanted slogans against the government for failing to release the appointment letters.\n\nThe protesters regretted that despite orders from the apex court in favour of the shortlisted candidates, there was no justification for the delay in issuing the letters. They called for the education department to immediately release the appointment letters.\n\nTribute paid to ex-lawmakers\n\nMeanwhile, the Balochistan Assembly paid a rich tribute to former lawmakers Tahir Mehm­ood Khan and Noor Muhammad Sarraf for their performance and services as ministers and members of the assembly.\n\nTahir Khan, who passed away last week, had served as the minister for education, while Noor Sarraf, who died on January 15, had been the minister for the QDA. Both were members of PPP.\n\nShahida Rauf of JUI-F tabled a joint resolution on behalf of other movers, expressing deep grief and sorrow over the passing of the former members of the Balochistan Assembly.\n\nThe resolution was adopted unanimously by the assembly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
