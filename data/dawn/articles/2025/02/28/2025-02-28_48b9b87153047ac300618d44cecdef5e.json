The LHC, however, had ruled that Faraz was not subject to the PAA and ordered his release forthwith.\n\n“Which poem landed Ahmad Faraz in jail, since all his poems have been learnt by heart,” wondered Justice Musarrat Hilali, recalling how she used to make a lot of fuss as a lawyer in the Bar whenever she lost a case.\n\n“I used to say that judges are like truck drivers, they signal to one direction but turn the opposite way,” Justice Hilali observed, suggesting the counsel pick up what she was saying.\n\nWhen Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi wondered, in jest, whether Justice Hilali also drove a truck, she replied in the affirmative, adding that her father was a freedom fighter who had spent a major chunk of his life in prison.\n\nThe poetry her father used to write was read by someone at a Pashtun jirga after his death and the one who recited the poem was arrested.\n\nThe counsel then cited the application of commanding officers seeking transfer of the custody of the accused. The applications began with words that initial investigation constitutes an offence under the Official Secrets Act, 1923.\n\nThese words are an admission that the investigation had not yet been completed, the counsel contended, adding that the reasons given by the anti-terrorism court (ATC) for the transfer of the accused were ridiculous.\n\nHe emphasised that by ordering the transfer the ATC’s administrative judge had declared the accused guilty, adding that when the investigation had not yet been completed the administrative judge had no such authority.\n\nUnder Section 59(1) of PAA, the custody of only military officers can be sought from the civil court if they were involved in murder and any other crimes, contended Mr Siddiqi.\n\nHe said the detention of the accused was possible only when he becomes subject to PAA. Thus, he added, unless formal charges were framed the accused cannot be court-martialled.\n\nThe CB will now resume hearing the case on Monday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
