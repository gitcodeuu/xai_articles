He stressed the need for equipping the youth with modern skills alongside traditional education to meet contemporary demands.\n\n“In line with modern requirements, we are prioritising the activation of technical and vocational institutions across the province and introducing IT courses in 11 public sector universities of the province,” he said.\n\nThe governor also highlighted the agricultural potential of Balochistan, noting that a significant portion of the population is engaged in farming. He suggested that investing in solar energy could help address the energy deficit in the province, thereby boosting agricultural productivity and economic growth.\n\nHe expressed gratitude for the support and guidance of developed nations and international organisations in advancing top quality education and skill development in Balochistan. He reiterated the province’s commitment to fostering partnerships that would benefit its people and contribute to regional stability.\n\nThe meeting concluded with an exchange of commemorative shields between Governor Mandokhail and Ambassador de Vries, symbolising the strengthening of relations between Pakistan and the Netherlands.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
