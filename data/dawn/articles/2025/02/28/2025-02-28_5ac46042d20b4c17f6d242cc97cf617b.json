  "content": "KARACHI: Trading on the Pakistan Stock Exch­ange (PSX) remained sluggish on Thursday, with share prices moving sideways. Low trading volumes and a lack of positive triggers contributed to the benchmark index’s continued losses.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the market closed lower as investors eye corporate and provincial tax reforms ahead of IMF approvals for the budgetary proposals for 2025-26.\n\n“Uncertainty regarding IPP deals and the outcome of tax reforms under the first review of the $7bn Extended Fund Facility next week contributed to a bearish market close,” he added.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the local bourse experienced a range-bound session as investor sentiment remained mixed due to a lack of market-moving triggers. The benchmark index fluctuated between an intraday high of 595 points and a low of 133 points. It eventually closed at 113,784 points, reflecting a modest decline of 78 points or 0.07 per cent day-on-day.\n\nThe positive contribution was primarily driven by the Oil and Gas Dev­e­lopment Company, Pakis­tan Petroleum, Sui Nor­thern Gas Pipeline, Pa­­ckages Ltd, and Meezan Bank, which added 231 points to the index. Con­versely, Lucky Cement, Habib Bank, and PSO wiped out 132 points.\n\nThe market participation was low as the trading volume plunged by 37.92pc to 397.39 million shares while the traded value decreased 15pc to Rs19.32bn day-on-day.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Cnergy­ico PK (71.83m shares), World­Call Telecom (20.25m shares), At-Tahur Ltd (17.62m shares), Sui Nort­hern Gas (15.82m sha­res) and Sui Southern Gas Pipeline (14.52m shares).\n\nThe shares registering the most significant incre­ases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Foods (Rs75.02), PIA Holding Company [B] (Rs30.75), Nestle Pakistan (Rs28.37), Ghandhara Industries (Rs24.10) and Indus Motor (Rs20.61).\n\nThe companies registering significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hoe­chst Pakistan (Rs184.68), Ismail Industries (Rs44.52), Mehmood Tex­tile (Rs42.18), Lucky Cem­ent (Rs23.00) and Sapph­ire Fibres (Rs22.77).\n\nForeign investors were net sellers as they offloa­ded shares worth $1.33m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
