The Greek coastguard denied these claims, saying it didn’t try to rescue the boat as those onboard wanted to reach Italy, not Greece.\n\nThe claims of the botched rescue attempt were confirmed by 30-year-old Usman Siddique, who was one of the 12 Pakistani survivors of that wreck.\n\nMr Siddique was a policeman in Guj­rat, who took a year’s leave to make the jo­­urney towards Europe. He rejoined duty after returning home on July 7, 2023. He told Dawn that around 12 hours before it sank, a helicopter took pictures of the boat and flew away.\n\nA cargo ship stopped near the boat on the same day for more than an hour, as the crew gave the migrants water bottles and bread, he added.\n\nHowever, late in the evening, Mr Sid­dique said, a big ship with Greek coast guards onboard arrived and remained at the scene for at least an hour.\n\nDespite being requested by the immigrants, particularly women and children for help, Mr Siddque said, the vessel left the scene.\n\nAnother ship then arrived at around 10 or 11pm and “towed our boat with a rope”. As soon as the ship pulled the boat, it started breaking up after tilting left and right.\n\n“There was a hue and cry as people were drowning. Some held on to the rope, which kept them alive,” Mr Siddique told Dawn. While most of the migrants perished, around 100 were rescued by another ship that arrived later.\n\nMr Siddique survived because he had learnt how to swim during his police training.\n\nThe cop, belonging to Kaleki village on the outskirts of Gujrat, had decided to go to Italy along with his four friends and left for Libya in May 2023. He said most of those who died in the accident were Pa­­kistanis hailing from Gujrat, Gujra­nwala, Mandi Bahauddin and Azad Kashmir.\n\nWaseem Ashraf Butt in Gujrat also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
