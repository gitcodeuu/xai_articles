Egy­pt’s state-linked Al-Qahera News said 97, marked for deportation by Israel, had arrived at Gaza’s Rafah crossing.\n\nThe prisoners freed on Thursday were meant to be released last weekend but Israel delayed the process after Hamas staged elaborate handover ceremonies.\n\nHamas said Thursday’s handover would take place in private “to prevent the occupation from finding any pretext for delay”.\n\nIn Ramallah, several freed Palestinians were lifted onto shoulders. A group of women wept around one released prisoner, and a child held aloft flashed victory signs with both hands.\n\n“We were in hell and we came out of hell. Today is my real day of birth,” said one prisoner, Yahya Shraideh.\n\nHours after the handover, an Israeli campaign group confirmed “with profound sorrow” the ide­ntities of the four bodies Hamas returned on Thu­rsday.\n\nOhad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan, Itzik Elgarat and Shlomo Mansour “have been laid to eternal rest in Israel”, said the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.\n\nNetanyahu pledged on Thursday to work “relentlessly” to bring back all the prisoners.\n\nPresident Isaac Herzog said on Thursday that Israel had a “moral obligation” to sec­ure the prisoners’ return.\n\nNegotiations\n\nAfter the swap, Hamas called on Israel to return to delayed talks on a second phase of the deal, intended to lead to a permanent end to the war. “We have cut off the path before the enemy’s false justifications, and it has no choice but to start negotiations for the second phase,” Hamas said.\n\nLater on Thursday, Netanyahu’s office said he instructed Israeli negotiators to head to Cairo for the Gaza talks.\n\nIsrael Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters in Jerusalem the delegation would travel to Egypt to see whether there was common ground to negotiate an extension to the truce.\n\n“We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more prisoners. If it is possible, we’ll do that.”\n\nTwo government offici­als told Reuters that Israel was seeking to extend the initial phase, with Hamas freeing three prisoners each week in exchange for Palestinians held by Israel.\n\nIn Washington, US President Donald Trump’s Middle East envoy said Israeli representatives were en route to talks on the next phase of the ceasefire.\n\n“We’re making a lot of progress. Israel is sending a team right now as we speak,” Steve Witkoff said.\n\nThe prospects for the second phase are far from certain, however.\n\nThe current truce agre­ement was only arrived at after months of gruelling negotiations, and some me­­mbers of Netanyahu’s coalition are eager to res­ume the war and destroy Hamas once and for all.\n\nThe October 7 attack resulted in the deaths of 1,218 people in Israel, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures.\n\nIsrael’s retaliation in Gaza has killed at least 48,365 people, according to the health ministry in the territory, figures that the United Nations considers credible.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
