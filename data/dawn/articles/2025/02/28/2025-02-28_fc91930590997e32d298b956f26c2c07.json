  "content": "LAHORE: The Water and Power Development Authority (Wapda) on Thursday organised a day-long conference on application of artificial intelligence (AI) for water resources planning and management with a view to fostering innovation by exploring the potential of AI in improving water resources sector.\n\nThe conference was held on Thursday at Wapda House, Lahore, where Wapda member (water) Jawaid Akhtar Latif was the chief guest.\n\nIt was attended by eminent scholars, researchers and students belonging to various universities across the country including NUST, GIKI, FAST, UET Lahore, LUMS, COMSATS, UET Taxila, Lahore College for Women University, Punjab University and QUEST, Nawabshah, and Mehran University, Jamshoro.\n\nThe participants engaged in vibrant discussions on how AI technologies can transform the management and sustainable utilisation of water resources in Pakistan.\n\nAddressing the opening session, Akhtar Latif said this conference marks Wapda’s initiative to foster innovation and knowledge sharing in water resources, a series designed to strengthen collaboration with academia and shape the future of water management in Pakistan.\n\nWater resources are fundamental to our nation’s existence and management of water resources are crucial. Artificial Intelligence offers unprecedented capabilities for analysis, prediction, and management, revolutionising our approach to complex water-related issues.\n\nThe conference showcases the forefront of AI’s application in addressing critical water resource challenges in Pakistan and beyond.\n\nWapda is playing a pivotal role in safeguarding this critical foundation.\n\nThe conference featured three technical sessions where researchers from across the country presented their research papers, which were thoroughly reviewed by a high-level technical committee. The research papers were focused on application of AI on hydropower, water resources, predicting and preventing climatic effects like glacial lake outburst flood and extreme events (floods and droughts), ground water, water distribution, drainage & hill torrents and improving environmental impacts and socio-economics of water resources interventions.\n\nProf Dr. Muhammad Irfan, principal & dean, School of Civil & Environmental Engineering, NUST, Islamabad, made a detailed deliberation on “leveraging AI in water resources planning, engineering & management”.\n\nProf Dr Atiqur Rehman, director, Centre of Excellence in Water Resources, UET Lahore highlighted “AI-driven Innovations in Water Resources Planning and Management” and Qurat ul Ain Ahmad, head of Water Resources and Glaciology Section, Ministry of Climate Change, shed light on the climate change-related water challenges of Pakistan.\n\nKeynote speakers at the event underscored the growing importance of AI in water resource management, with applications in dams, hydropower, and groundwater addressing environmental and socio-economic challenges.\n\nAI can be utilised to enhance decision-making, improve water efficiency, optimise dam operations, and maximise hydropower generation, promoting sustainable development.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
