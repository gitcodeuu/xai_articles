  "content": "WASHINGTON: The US Federal Bureau of Investigation on Wednes­day accused North Korea of being behind the theft of $1.5 billion worth of digital assets last week, the largest crypto heist in history.\n\nDubai-based cryptocurrency exchange Bybit reported last week that it had been robbed of 400,000 in cryptocurrency Ethereum.\n\nAccording to the company, attackers exploited security protocols during a transaction, enabling them to transfer the assets to an unidentified address.\n\nOn Wednesday, the US government pointed the finger at Pyongyang. “(North Korea) was responsible for the theft of approximately $1.5 billion USD in virtual assets from cryptocurrency exchange, Bybit,” the FBI said in a public service announcement.\n\nThe bureau said a group called TraderTraitor, also known as the Lazarus Group, was behind the theft. It said they were “proceeding rapidly and have converted some of the stolen assets to Bitcoin and other virtual assets dispersed across thousands of addresses on multiple blockchains”.\n\n“It is expected these assets will be further laundered and eventually converted to fiat currency,” the FBI added. Lazarus Group gained notoriety a decade ago when it was accused of hacking into Sony Pictures as revenge for “The Interview,” a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nIt was also allegedly behind the 2022 $620 million heist of Ethereum and USD Coin from the Ronin Network in 2022, previously the biggest crypto theft in history.\n\nAnd in December, the United States and Japan blamed it for the theft of cryptocurrency worth over $300 million from the Japan-based exchange DMM Bitcoin.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
