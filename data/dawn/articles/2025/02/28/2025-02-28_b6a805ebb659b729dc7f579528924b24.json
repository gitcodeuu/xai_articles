  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan government on Wednesday criticised Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan for turning down an official invitation to visit the province, accusing him of prioritising political rhetoric over constructive engagement.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference at the Chief Minister’s Secretariat, Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti had extended a formal invitation to Mr Khan to witness the situation firsthand and engage in constructive dialogue.\n\nHowever, instead of accepting the offer, he chose to perpetuate a narrative of political discord, which the spokesperson termed “irresponsible and reflective of his lack of understanding of his constitutional role”.\n\nMr Rind recalled that CM Bugti had held a detailed conversation with the opposition leader a day earlier, assuring him of all necessary facilities and security during his visit. The Balochistan government had even offered to arrange tours of every district to enable Mr Khan to observe the realities on the ground, he added. “By turning non-issues into issues, Omar Ayub has made it clear that he is failing to fulfil the responsibilities of his constitutional position as the opposition leader.”\n\nMr Rind said the Balochistan government seeks to avoid the politics of accusations but pointed out the irony of Mr Khan’s criticism, given the deteriorating law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where his party has been in power for the past decade.\n\nMr Rind said CM Bugti has repeatedly invited all stakeholders, including Mr Khan, for consultations and dialogue on national issues, particularly peace and security.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2025",
