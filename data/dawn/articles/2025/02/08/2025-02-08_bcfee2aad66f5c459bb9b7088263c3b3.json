  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court on Friday directed a lawyer to satisfy it about the maintainability of a petition impugning the amendments to the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca).\n\nPetitioners Anis Mansoori and three other journalists moved the SHC and submitted that they were aggrieved by the impugned amendments to Peca.\n\nThey submitted that the amendments were made in violation of the fundamental rights as provided in the Constitution and two new sub-sections (2R & 26A) introduced through Section 3 and 5 of Peca 2016 were ultra vires of the Constitution.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, a two-judge SHC bench comprising Chief Justice Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui and Justice Jawad Akbar Sarwana heard arguments of petitioners’ counsel Ali Tahir.\n\nHowever, the bench noted that his arguments were not expressive and directed him to advance more arguments on Feb 10 about the maintainability of the petition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2025",
