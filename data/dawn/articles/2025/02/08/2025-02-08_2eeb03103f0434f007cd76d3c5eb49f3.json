  "content": "President Donald Trump signed an executive order to cut US financial assistance to South Africa, the White House said on Friday, citing disapproval of its land policy and its genocide case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) against Washington’s ally Israel.\n\nThe United States allocated nearly $440 million in assistance to South Africa in 2023, the most recent US government data shows.\n\nThe White House said Washington will also formulate a plan to resettle white South African farmers and their families as refugees.\n\nIt said US officials will take steps to prioritise humanitarian relief, including admission and resettlement through the United States Refugee Admissions Program for Afrikaners in South Africa, who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers.\n\nTrump has said, without citing evidence, that “South Africa is confiscating land” and that “certain classes of people” were treated “very badly”. South African-born billionaire Elon Musk, who is close to Trump, has said that white South Africans have been the victims of “racist ownership laws”.\n\nSouth African President Cyril Ramaphosa — who signed into law a bill last month aimed at making it easier for the state to expropriate land in the public interest — has defended the policy.\n\nHe has said the government had not confiscated any land and the policy was aimed at evening out racial disparities in land ownership in the Black-majority nation. Ramaphosa said South Africa “will not be bullied”.\n\nWashington has also complained about the case brought by South Africa at the ICJ, where it accused Israel of genocide over Israel’s military assault on Gaza that has killed tens of thousands and caused a humanitarian crisis.\n\nIsrael denies the allegations, insisting it acted in self-defence following the Oct 7, 2023 attack by Hamas.\n\nThe White House cited that case as an example of South Africa taking positions against Washington and its allies.\n\nThe executive order signed by Trump will address human rights issues in South Africa, the White House said. Trump had threatened to cut off funding for the nation soon after taking office.\n\nThe question of land ownership is highly politically charged in South Africa, due to the legacy of the colonial and apartheid eras when Black people were dispossessed of their lands and denied property rights.\n\nWhite landowners still possess three-quarters of South Africa’s freehold farmland. This contrasts with 4 per cent owned by Black people, who make up 80pc of the population compared with about 8pc for whites, according to the latest 2017 land audit.",
