  "content": "IT was what one may safely describe as a ‘memorable’ occasion. Exactly a year ago today, adult-aged Pakistanis from all faiths, cultures, ethnicities, and socioeconomic classes had headed to their assigned polling stations to cast their ballots in a much-delayed general election.\n\nIt was remarkable how many expectations they ended up defying that day. One recalls the unannounced blackout of all mobile communication services, enforced by the authorities shortly before polls opened, which had left people without access to vital election-related information and unable to contact their friends and families.\n\nIt was not enough to deter the over 59 million citizens intent on having their voices heard that day. One also recalls the smug predictions of television pundits and the surveys fed to the media in the run-up to election day. None of them prepared the nation for the coup ordinary Pakistanis pulled off merely with the help of a stamp and a ballot paper.\n\nNo observer can honestly deny that the last election’s results were highly unexpected.\n\nConsiderable effort was made to keep one party out of the race. The party’s leadership was jailed, its workers picked up, its electoral symbol withdrawn, and its candidates, even after being forced to declare themselves independents, not allowed to campaign.\n\nIf the previous elections were manipulated — perhaps by the same elements — to bring the PTI to power, they went out of their way to ensure that it did not have any chance this time around.\n\nDespite all their machinations, however, the PTI ended up winning an unexpectedly large chunk of the popular vote.\n\nThe results announced two things: one, that Pakistan’s youth had finally arrived on the political scene, and two, that ordinary voters had overwhelmingly rejected the narratives set by the powers of the day. In this sense, the 2024 election was indeed a historic one.\n\nMuch went wrong after Feb 8, 2024, mainly because responsible individuals within the Pakistani state refused to come to terms with the country’s changed realities.\n\nHowever, though the injustices that followed the last general election cannot be forgotten, it is equally important to start thinking about what must now be done to mitigate their effects.\n\nThe country has continued to march on a path of implosion, unable to contain the dissonance created by a conflict between what those controlling the state want and what the people want for themselves. Unless this fundamental conflict is resolved, the country will not be at peace with itself.\n\nA war of egos has been fought between a handful of individuals at the cost of the well-being of millions of ordinary Pakistanis. This unnecessary war must be called to an end. The people of Pakistan have been wronged for too long. They need a change.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2025",
