The judge stressed the need for appropriate rules to conserve water. He suggested banning car wash at homes to save significant amounts of water.\n\nThe judge ordered a citywide campaign with banners and posters explicitly informing the public about the ban on washing cars at home.\n\nHe instructed the authorities to utilise Dolphin Force to monitor and ensure compliance with these measures.\n\nProposes Rs100,000 fine on petrol pumps sans water treatment plants; police to ensure compliance\n\nThe judge said filling stations without water treatment plants should be sealed with an initial warning followed by a fine of Rs100,000. He also emphasised the need to prevent water wastage at mosques.\n\nJustice Karim expressed concerns about the poor traffic management during major events, noting that residents remain uninformed about the alternative routes.\n\nHe criticised the authorities for not planning in advance, despite knowing about the Champions Trophy event for months.\n\nHe inquired about the chief traffic officer’s absence, summoning him on Feb 10 regarding the traffic situation during major events in the city.\n\nSenior lawyer Mian Irfan Akram complained about severe traffic congestion outside the Mall Road gate of the Lahore High Court, saying auto rickshaws blocked the entrance, causing difficulties for the lawyers.\n\nJustice Karim observed that it was concerning to see lawyers in such a helpless state.\n\nIn October 2023, Justice Shahid Karim had directed the quarters concerned to impose Rs3,000 over car washing at homes.\n\nNOTICE: The Lahore High Court on Friday issued a notice on a petition challenging the fifth extension in the employment of Walled City Authority DG Kamran Lashari and sought replies from the Secretary of Local Government and others.\n\nJustice Shujaat Ali Khan heard the petition filed by Advocate Khalid Jamil challenging Kamran Lashari’s appointment.\n\nThe petitioner argued that, according to the law, a contract employee can only be granted one extension, whereas the Punjab Local Government secretary issued a notification extending Mr Lashari’s tenure.\n\nThe petitioner pointed out that the contract of DG (Walled City Authority) Kamran Lashari had been extended until 2027 under Section 6 of the Walled City Authority Act, 2012.\n\nHe asked the court to set aside the extension in the appointment of the respondent DG for being unlawful.\n\nThe judge directed a provisional law officer to submit replies on behalf of the respondents within a week.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2025",
