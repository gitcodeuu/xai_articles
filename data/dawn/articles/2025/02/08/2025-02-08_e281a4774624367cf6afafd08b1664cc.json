Let us make ‘Breathe Pakistan’ our resounding call to action to ensure a cleaner, greener and more resilient Pakistan for generations to come,” he added.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nThe outcomes of the moot were highlighted by Florence Rolle, Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) representative in Pakistan; Aban Marker Kabraji, a regional adviser for climate and environment at United Nations Environment Programme; and Dawar Butt, a climate and sustainability expert. Romina Khurshid Alam, coordinator to PM on Climate Change, also attended the session.\n\nMs Rolle, reading off the outcomes of the conference, said the key takeaway from the conference was “recognition”. She elaborated that climate change was not about something in isolation but affected all sectors of life, the economy and the environment; therefore, it needed to be addressed in a multi-sectoral and multidimensional way.\n\nThe second takeaway is that Pakistan’s climate financing needs far exceed available resources, making international support crucial.\n\n“We believe there is a dire need for Pakistan to advance climate finance agenda, mobilise international resources and have the capacity to attract these climate finance opportunities,” she said.\n\nMs Rolle said that the gap between the global finance commitments and their implementation should be narrowed with a balance focused on adaptation and mitigation as well as loss and damage.\n\nThe third takeaway from the conference was the Living Indus initiative, which brought together all the provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir towards a common vision of restoring the ecosystem of the Indus basin.\n\n“The government is deeply committed to the transformative agenda of the Living Indus and it is reflected through strategic policy programmes action that are being implemented at the moment to ensure the restoration health of the basin,” Ms Rolle read.\n\nThe fourth key takeaway was gender and climate impact, with women and girls facing greater climate-related vulnerabilities due to social and economic inequalities.\n\n“We look forward to specific measures for adopting and implementing strategy on climate change mitigation and adaptation to support the resilience of these women and girls in Pakistan,” Ms Rolle said.\n\nAnother key outcome of the conference was the impact of climate change on agriculture, water and forest resources, which will result in food security for the growing population of Pakistan in the coming decades.\n\nThe conference also recognised the media’s crucial role in promoting climate awareness, transparency and accountability. It stressed the need for responsible journalism to ensure that climate-related policies and initiatives are effectively communicated to the public and policymakers.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2025",
