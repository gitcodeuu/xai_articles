  "content": "LAHORE: The Nishtar Alumni Association of North America (NANA) says the dialysis machines are not considered a source of HIV spread if proper infection control measures are taken.\n\nIt has raised certain questions over the quality of the investigation carried out on the directions of the Punjab government to determine the exact causes which led to the HIV infection in 25 kidney patients.\n\n“We have completed investigations into the HIV outbreak in the dialysis unit at the Nishtar Hospital and formulated recommendations, demanding reinstatement of the medical teaching leadership and other staff members of the institute suspended or removed from their positions.\n\n“Unfortunately, in this case, the investigations failed to determine the source of the outbreak,” says Nishtar Alumni of North America President Dr Mohammad Shoib.\n\nThe Nishtar Alumni Association of North America is an organisation that represents graduates of Nishtar Medical University/College, Multan, all over the USA and Canada.\n\nQuoting the investigation report, Dr Shoib said the recent HIV outbreak in the Dialysis Unit at Nishtar Hospital was deeply concerning for the global Pakistani medical community, particularly among Nishtarians practicing in the United States.\n\nThis alarming event has not only raised critical questions about the unexpected emergence of these cases but has also brought into focus the response from the relevant authorities in addressing the matter.\n\nIn response, he said, the NANA established a task force comprising experienced nephrologists, infectious disease experts, and epidemiologists based in the United States to offer guidance and support.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2025",
