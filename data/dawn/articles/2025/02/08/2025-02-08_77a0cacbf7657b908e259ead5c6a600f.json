She shared the initiatives taken by the provincial government during the last 10 months.\n\nMarriyum calls for integrated approach to address climate change issue\n\n“We had to take a comprehensive, holistic, integrated, multi-sectoral approach towards climate resilience across Punjab,” she said.\n\nAccording to her, environmental factors have created negative impacts across multiple sectors in Punjab, adding that low rainfall has caused 82pc increase in water shortage in South Punjab while rising temperatures resulted in a one to 18pc reduction in wheat, rice, maize and cotton yield.\n\nShe also highlighted that poor air quality led to a 10 to 40pc reduction in crops like wheat, rice, soya beans, corn, and potatoes.\n\n“A total of Rs10 billion has been allocated to smog mitigation while Rs100bn has been allocated to climate resilience projects across Punjab,” she said.\n\nMs Aurangzeb informed the participants that Islamabad had written a letter to New Delhi to initiate dialogue with the countries in the region that had a direct impact on the air quality.\n\nCoordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change Romina Khurshid Alam noted that Pakistan stood at a defining moment in its climate journey.\n\nThe UN’s Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator, Mohamed Yahya, talked about the importance of the River Indus, stating that it is in crisis and there is a need to restore its basin.\n\nRegional Adviser Climate and Environment UNEP Aban Marker Kabraji, Unicef representative Abdullah Fadil, FAO representative in Pakistan Florence Rolle and UNIC Director Catherine Weible also talked about the River Indus in detail, besides climate issues.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2025",
