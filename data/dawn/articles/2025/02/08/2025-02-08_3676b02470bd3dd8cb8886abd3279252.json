He said they hailed from Bahawalpur.\n\nHe added that the bodies were moved to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre.\n\nEarlier this month, three people were killed when a garbage truck belonging to the Sindh Solid Waste Management Board hit multiple vehicles on Rashid Minhas Road.\n\nAn alarming rise in fatal accidents involving dumper trucks and water tankers has sparked widespread outrage against the traffic police, with opposition parties, the governor and Karachi mayor all calling for restrictions on the movement of heavy vehicles in the metropolis in the daytime to prevent further loss of precious of lives.\n\nThe opposition Jamaat-i-Islami and Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan have accused the traffic police of taking bribes to allow heavy traffic to move freely in the city during daytime.\n\nThe strong criticism came following the tragic death of as many as nine persons, including a couple and an employee of the Pakistan Navy, who, according to the traffic police, were killed in six traffic accidents across the city on Thursday.\n\nGovernor Kamran Tessori expressed his anger over the growing fatal accidents and unchecked movement of the heavy traffic and asked the Sindh government, provincial ministers and the police to take decisive action against “bloodthirsty dumper trucks”.",
