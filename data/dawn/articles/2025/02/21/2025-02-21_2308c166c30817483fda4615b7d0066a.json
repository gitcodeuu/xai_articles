The country’s economic struggles and high debt burden impinged on its ability to respond to the disaster.\n\nStructured climate financing\n\nMeanwhile, Senator Sherry Rehman on Thursday stressed the urgent need for structured climate financing to address the country’s growing environmental challenges.\n\nMs Rehman, chairing the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Chan­­ge, highlighted Pakistan’s financial constraints compared to Bangla­desh, calling for immediate intervention.\n\nDuring the meeting, discussions centred on bridging the estimated $340bn funding gap required for sustainability in collaboration with the Ministry of Finance.\n\n“Climate finance is more than just pledges; it requires accessible funds and institutional capacity for resilience,” Ms Rehman said. “Our current financial frameworks are inadequate, and without a robust strategy, Pakistan will struggle with climate adaptation and mitigation.”\n\nAccording to a statement, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb acknowledged the challenges and stressed the importance of a structured approach, incorporating key enablers such as the National Adaptation Plan and National Climate Finance Strategy. He emphasised the need for clear definitions of green technology to enable effective monitoring.\n\nHe also noted that the World Bank’s Country Partnership Frame­work prioritised climate financing, while ongoing discussions with the IMF under the Extended Fund Facility aim to secure around $1bn. However, bureaucratic hurdles continue to obstruct climate fund access, necessitating streamlined processes, he stressed.\n\nSherry Rehman and the finance minister agreed on the need for innovative climate financing mechanisms to mobilise resources effectively. They also reviewed the Electric Vehicle (EV) Policy, with Ms Rehman emphasising its importance in reducing emissions and combating urban pollution.\n\n“Punjab’s smog crisis and the broader energy transition depend on active EV adoption,” she said.\n\nMr Aurangzeb echoed this sentiment, noting that policy alignment in the budget is crucial for EV initiatives. He announced the formation of an advisory board to oversee policy implementation and address taxation anomalies hindering EV adoption.\n\n“Removing these barriers will incentivise importers and manufacturers, facilitating a shift to a cleaner transport system,” he added.\n\nMs Rehman also called for urgent reforms in carbon sink management, particularly in mangrove restoration. She urged policy adjustments to enable Sindh to utilise its delta resources more effectively.\n\n“Private funding alone is unsustainable. We must explore innovative financing options, including foreign markets for waste management,” she said.\n\nShe further advocated for structured project metrics, debt swaps and institutional agility to enhance financial viability.\n\n“Climate action cannot succeed without direct involvement from the finance and planning ministries. A dedicated financial cell within the Ministry of Finance is essential,” she said.\n\nThe session also brought together other key stakeholders, including senators Bushra Anjum Butt and Sarmad Khan, the PM’s Climate Change Coordinator Romina Alam, and revenue officials.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 21st, 2025",
