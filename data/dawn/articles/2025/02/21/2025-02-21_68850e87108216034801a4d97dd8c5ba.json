Terror attacks have increased since the TTP broke a fragile ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.\n\nLast week, security forces killed 13 terrorists in five separate operations carried out across KP on Thursday night.\n\nIn separate IBOs on Feb 15, four soldiers were martyred while 15 terrorists were killed in KP on Saturday.\n\nSeparately, security forces killed 30 terrorists in an IBO in KP’s South Waziristan district, ISPR said in a statement on Tuesday.\n\nWith at least 685 members of security forces losing their lives amid a total of 444 terror attacks, 2024 turned out to be the deadliest year for the civil and military security forces of Pakistan in a decade, according to a 2024 report issued by the Centre for Research and Security Studies think-tank.\n\nAccording to the ISPR Director General, security forces conducted a total of 59,775 operations last year during which 925 terrorists were killed and 383 officers and soldiers were martyred.",
