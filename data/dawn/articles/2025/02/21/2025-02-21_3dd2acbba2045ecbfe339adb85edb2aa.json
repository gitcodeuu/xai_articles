The supply cannot be stopped,” he added.\n\nPakistan ranks as the nation most affected by climate change, according to non-profit Germanwatch’s Climate Risk Index released this year and analysing data from 2022.\n\nThat year a third of the country was inundated by unprecedented monsoon floods killing more than 1,700 and causing an estimated $14.9 billion in damages after a punishing summer heatwave.\n\nJacobabad’s water system also suffered heavy damage in the 2010 floods which killed almost 1,800 and affected 21 million.\n\nPakistan produces less than one percent of global greenhouse gas emissions which scientists say are driving human-made climate change.\n\nIslamabad has consistently called for countries which emit more to contribute to aid for its population suffering on the front line of climate change. “It’s incredibly hot here year-round,” said Lashari. “We need water constantly.”",
