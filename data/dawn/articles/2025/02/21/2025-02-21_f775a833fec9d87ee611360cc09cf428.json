The rising of women is the awakening of everybody,” Dr Trent said.\n\nBarech, who belongs to Nushki in Balochistan, hoped to be the one who shapes the narrative associated with militancy regarding her hometown.\n\nAccording to the press release, she is the youngest novelist and memoirist, having written her debut novel at 11, and beginning her memoir at 14.\n\nIt said that she is Pakistan’s youngest self-published author.\n\nAccording to the press release, her journey extends beyond literature, having served as a Unicef Pakistan ambassador for polio eradication, a youth ambassador for mental health in Unicef’s On My Mind campaign, and has also been a youth ambassador for the Quetta Gladiators.\n\nIt said that she is serving as a youth advisor to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during Shehbaz Sharif and a member of the National Youth Council, stating that she has been awarded a Trailblazer Author by Unicef’s Girl of the Day campaign.\n\nIt said she is the first female Pashtun from Balochistan to earn a merit scholarship and acceptance into John Locke Summer University 2024.\n\nAs the prime minister’s youth advisor, “she serves as a bridge between marginalised communities and policymakers, ensuring her generation’s concerns are not just acknowledged but acted upon”, the release said.\n\nShe has also focused on amplifying her generation’s concerns, particularly the media blackout of Balochistan, it said.\n\n“I want to recalibrate biases, uplift underrepresented voices, and drive meaningful change because when no road is laid out, I do not wait. I create one,” Dr Trent was quoted as saying. It said that she is “committed to continuing to make an impact through her work and her vision for the future is to rewrite narratives”.",
