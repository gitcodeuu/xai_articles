  "content": "KARACHI: Sindh Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon has said that in response to the rising number of fatal road accidents, the provincial government has launched a crackdown on unfit commercial vehicles across Sindh.\n\nAccording to a statement issued here, the minister added that the transport department had instructed all authorities concerned to take immediate and effective action against unfit commercial vehicles.\n\nHe said that many commercial vehicles were using fitness certificates issued by Motor Vehicle Inspectors (MVIs) from other provinces.\n\n“This is a serious issue because these vehicles have neither been physically inspected by the Sindh MVIs nor issued fitness certificates following the prescribed procedure,” the minister said.\n\nHe noted that several commercial vehicles registered in other provinces were continuously operating in Sindh.\n\nRaising concerns about the authenticity and quality of these certificates, he said these vehicles might not have been inspected at the time the certificates were issued.\n\nHe stated that the presence of such unfit vehicles on Sindh’s roads was contributing to an increase in accidents and fatal incidents, putting the lives of drivers and other road users at risk due to mechanical faults.\n\nMr Memon further stated that all commercial vehicles registered across Sindh would be required to obtain new fitness certificates.\n\nThese certificates will be issued through the Sindh MVIs and will include modern security features, including a QR code.\n\nHe added that commercial vehicles registered in other provinces but operating permanently in Sindh would also be required to obtain a fitness certificate from Sindh.\n\nAt the time of issuance or renewal of a route permit, all commercial vehicles will be required to present a valid fitness certificate with a QR code, he said.\n\nMr Memon said that the aim of these measures was to ensure the proper inspection and certification of all commercial vehicles operating in Sindh and to reduce traffic accidents caused by unfit vehicles.\n\nThe unrestricted movement of these unfit vehicles poses a serious threat to human lives. All commercial vehicles are being brought under a transparent fitness certification system, he concluded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 21st, 2025",
