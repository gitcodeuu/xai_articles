  "content": "GILGIT: Internal rifts between two groups of PML-N Gilgit-Baltistan chapter have intensified as both sides are lobbying to get the post of party’s regional president.\n\nPML-N leaders have expre­ssed fears that the acrimony would hurt the party’s chances of winning the regional election to be held later this year.\n\nBoth camps, one led by former GB chief minister Hafeezur Rehman and the other by Minister for Agriculture Muha­mmad Anwar Khan, are currently in Islamabad to convince the party’s high command.\n\nEarlier this week, a delegation led by Mr Rehman met with the federal minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, Amir Muqam, to discuss the party’s issues.\n\nA statement issued after the meeting said the leaders discussed the current political situation in GB, the upcoming elections in the region and the federal government’s public welfare initiatives.\n\nGroups led by former CM, current minister ‘lobbying’ against each other\n\nThe federal minister “reiterated his full support to PML-N Gilgit-Baltistan” for the elections.\n\nHe also expressed faith in Mr Rehman’s leadership to ensure the party’s victory.\n\nTwo days after the meeting, the group led by Mr Khan also met the federal minister.\n\nMr Khan, who is also PML-N’s general secretary in GB, expressed reservations over the leadership of Mr Rehman.\n\nIn a statement, the group said Mr Rehman’s tenure as PML-N GB president ended in November last year.\n\nThe group, claiming the support of majority electables and old PML-N leaders, demanded the party’s reorganisation in the region.\n\nThey claimed that Mr Rehman had been heading the party in GB for more than 20 years, and the party made him the chief minister in 2015.\n\nMr Rehman has “sidelined the party leadership” and has surrounded himself with like-minded individuals, the group claimed.\n\nMr Rehman’s policies have “weakened” the party in the region, which will be a challenge in the upcoming elections.\n\nSources said both group heads had approached the party’s central leadership and conveyed their reservations.\n\nAccording to sources, the differences between the two groups emerged some years ago.\n\nLast year, when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif visited the region, both groups expressed reservations and criticised each other. The PM had assigned Mr Muqam as a mediator to sort out the differences.\n\nA senior party member told Dawn that differences between the two groups had only intensified since then.\n\nBoth have been lobbying against each other for the last two years and it has “weakened the party in the region”.\n\n“Today, the party is disintegrated” ahead of elections,“ the PML-N leader said.\n\nAnother party leader said PML-N’s internal differences will benefit someone else in the elections.\n\n“People are quitting the party as “no one was ready to accept each other”, the PML-N leader said.\n\nHe warned that if this situation persisted, it would be difficult for the party to win the required number of seats to form a government in GB.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 3rd, 2025",
