  "content": "JUST as the people of Kurram began to see some relief in the form of convoys laden with essentials reaching Parachinar and other parts of the district cut off from the rest of the country due to bloodshed, fresh violence on Friday showed that calm in the tribal district can be shattered very easily.\n\nLocal authorities had intervened to keep the peace after two men were injured in a firing incident. Yet even the government peacemakers came under fire, highlighting the volatile state of affairs in Kurram.\n\nAssistant Commissioner Saeed Manan, who was trying to mediate, was shot but is, thankfully, out of danger. However, a policeman, Ashiq Hussain, later succumbed to his wounds. This is not the first time officials and security men have come under attack.\n\nLast month, the then deputy commissioner Javedullah Mehsud survived a murderous attack in Bagan, while days later militants martyred a number of security men. A ‘limited’ counterterrorism operation was launched thereafter, but as the latest attack shows, much more needs to be done to pacify Kurram.\n\nAdmittedly, the Kurram imbroglio is complicated, where tribal disputes over land and water have become intertwined with long-running sectarian feuds. There is also a geopolitical and security angle, as many of the Sunni militant groups active in the area are on good terms with the Afghan Taliban, while Shia militants linked to the Zainabiyoun Brigade maintain a strong presence in Kurram.\n\nBloodletting has been continuing since last year, and matters exploded after a convoy was attacked in November. Since then, attacks and counterattacks have been frequent.\n\nThe state has made several — some would say belated — attempts to quell the violence, the most significant coming in the form of a peace deal hammered out on New Year’s Day. But clearly, it will take full commitment by all state institutions, as well as the earnest cooperation of local tribes, to make the agreement work.\n\nA grand jirga was held on Friday in Kohat to discuss the Kurram situation. At this gathering, the KP government spokesperson seemed upbeat about peace prospects. While the state’s efforts to contain bloodshed are appreciable, it will take more than words to bring lasting calm to Kurram.\n\nAt the Kohat Jirga, the KP spokesman said it was essential that “miscreants” involved in troublemaking be handed over to the authorities. He also said a relief package for Kurram was being finalised. Both these issues are important.\n\nThose involved in violence must face the law, while those who have suffered during the conflict must be compensated financially. Moreover, the closure of roads in Kurram cannot be tolerated, and all thoroughfares should be made safe for travel. Efforts to engender reconciliation and forgiveness between Kurram’s tribes must also continue.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 3rd, 2025",
