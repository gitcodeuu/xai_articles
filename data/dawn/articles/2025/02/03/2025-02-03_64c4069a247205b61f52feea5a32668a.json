Yes, maybe (and maybe not!)” Trump wrote on Sunday morning in all-caps on his Truth Social media platform. “But we will Make America Great Again, and it will all be worth the price that must be paid.”\n\nAnalysts expect the trade war to slow US growth and increase prices, at least in the short term, something the president had resisted acknowledging after frustration over rising costs was seen as a major factor in his 2024 election win.\n\nSeeking to limit a spike in fuel prices, Trump has put the levy on energy imports from Canada at only 10pc.\n\nThe president has cited illegal immigration and the trafficking of the deadly opioid fentanyl as reasons for the “emergency” measures.\n\nBut on Sunday he also expressed general outrage at trade deficits, which he has long viewed as signs of unfair treatment against the United States.\n\n“The USA has major deficits with Canada, Mexico, and China (and almost all countries!), owes 36 trillion dollars, and we’re not going to be the ‘Stupid Country’ any longer,” he wrote.\n\nThe tariffs announcements capped an extraordinary second week of Trump’s new term, with the president facing the worst US aviation disaster in years even as his administration moved to drastically overhaul the government in actions decried by critics as illegal.\n\nIn a separate social media post, Trump took particular aim at Canada, repeating his call for America’s northern neighbour to become a US state.\n\nClaiming the United States pays “hundreds of billions of dollars to subsidise Canada”, Trump said that “without this massive subsidy, Canada ceases to exist as a viable country”.\n\n“Therefore, Canada should become our cherished 51st state,” he said, reiterating the expansionist threat against one of his country’s closest allies.\n\nThe US Census Bureau says the 2024 trade deficit in goods with Canada was $55 billion.\n\nCanadian backlash was swift, with video posted to social media showing fans at a Toronto Raptors game on Sunday booing during the US national anthem.\n\nTrudeau vowed on Saturday to hit back with 25pc levies on select American goods worth Can$155bn (US$106.6bn), with a first round on Tuesday followed by a second one in three weeks.\n\nLeaders of several Canadian provinces have already announced retaliatory actions as well, such as the immediate halt of US liquor purchases.\n\nThe White House has not publicly announced what actions could end the tariffs.\n\n“It’s hard to know what more we can do, but we’re obviously open to any other suggestions that come our way,” Canada’s ambassador to the United States Kirsten Hillman told ABC News on Sunday.\n\nSheinbaum said she had directed her economy minister to “implement Plan B”, which includes unspecified “tariff and non-tariff measures”, promising to detail later today the steps she intends to take.\n\nTrump said on Sunday he also planned to hit the European Union with tariffs “pretty soon”, to which the EU said earlier it would “respond firmly”.",
