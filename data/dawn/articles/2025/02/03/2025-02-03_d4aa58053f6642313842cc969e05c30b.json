The combined toll of militant attacks and security operations in January stood at 245 fatalities, comprising 185 militants, 40 security forces personnel and 20 civilians.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) remained the worst-affected province, followed by Balo­chistan. In KP’s settled districts, insurgents carried out 27 attacks, resulting in 19 fatalities, including 11 security personnel, six civilians, and two militants.\n\nThe tribal districts of KP (erstwhile Fata) witnessed 19 attacks, leading to 46 deaths, including 13 security personnel, eight civilians, and 25 militants.\n\nBalochistan also experienced a surge in militant activity, with at least 24 attacks, which claimed 26 lives, including 11 security personnel, six civilians, and nine militants.\n\nIn Punjab, two militant attacks were reported, leaving one security official injured. On the last day of January, militants launched a major assault on a police check post in DG Khan’s Jhangi area, but security forces repelled the attack without any casualties. Sindh and the federal capital, Islamabad, each witnessed one attack, though neither resulted in fatalities.\n\nThe month also saw two suicide bombings, both in Baloc­histan. The banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for one, while the proscribed Balochistan Liberation Army took credit for the other.\n\nAdditionally, the report observed a concerning spike in kidnappings, with militants abducting at least 37 individuals.\n\nOf these, 22 were taken in five incidents across KP’s Lakki Marwat and Tank districts, while 15 were kidnapped in North and South Waziristan. The surge in abductions in southern KP reflects a deteriorating security situation in the region, it stated.\n\nMeanwhile, security forces intensified operations across KP and Balochistan, eliminating 67 militants in the tribal districts of KP (erstwhile Fata), 71 in its settled areas, and 47 in Balochistan. Counterterrorism raids were reported in multiple parts of both provinces as authorities sought to curb the growing militant threat.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 3rd, 2025",
