He added that there were discussions about sending a notification to US Congress to inform lawmakers of the administration’s plans.\n\nBillionaire Musk is heading Trump’s drive to cut wasteful spending within the federal government. But Musk’s increasingly harsh accusations against USAID — many lodged without evidence — have raised questions about whether his political views are driving efforts to gut the agency.\n\nThe rush of events has also underlined Musk’s powerful role in setting Trump’s agenda. Last week, Musk’s team at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) gained access to the most sensitive payment systems at the US Treasury and, as Reuters reported, locked some federal personnel career employees out of their agency’s own computers.\n\nHundreds of USAID programmes covering billions of dollars worth of lifesaving aid across the globe came to a grinding halt after Trump on January 20 ordered a freeze of most US foreign aid, saying he wanted to ensure it is aligned with his “America First” policy.\n\nIf USAID were put under the State Department, it would likely have dramatic consequences for the distribution of aid from the world’s largest single donor, the United States.\n\nTrump told reporters on Sunday that USAID has “been run by a bunch of radical lunatics”. He added, “We’re getting them out, and then we’ll make a decision.”\n\nMusk said in a broadcast on Monday that USAID was “beyond repair” and that Trump agreed it should be shut down.\n\nIn the broadcast, Musk said he had discussed USAID in detail with Trump. “I want to be clear,” Musk said. “I actually checked with him a few times. I said, Are you sure? Yes.”\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters in San Salvador that he was now the acting head of USAID, calling the agency “completely unresponsive” and accusing the staff there of being “unwilling to answer simple questions” about programmes.\n\nOver the past week, mayhem has prevailed at USAID’s offices in Washington, DC, where dozens of staff have been put on leave. Over the weekend two senior security staff were also put on leave after refusing to provide classified documents to DOGE employees on site.\n\nToday, USAID employees were told their headquarters in downtown Washington had been shut for the day.\n\n“At the direction of the agency leadership, the USAID headquarters at the Ronald Reagan building in Washington, DC will be closed to agency personnel on Monday, February 3, 2025,” said an internal email to USAID staff, seen by Reuters.\n\nThe White House official said employees were asked to stay home due to security concerns on the property.\n\nThe row between DOGE staff and USAID triggered outrage among Democrats. A group of Democratic lawmakers said they will gather at 1pm ET outside the USAID headquarters to protest the closure, calling it “the Trump administration’s and Elon Musk’s illegal shutdown.”\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, the US disbursed $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/Aids treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42 per cent of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024.\n\nThe State Department issued worldwide stop-work directives after Trump’s freeze order, with the exception of emergency food assistance. Experts warned the move risks killing people.\n\nThree sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that USAID personal services contractors (PSC) — who carry out the bulk of the work in the agency’s humanitarian bureau — have also been locked out of their government accounts.\n\n“Without PSCs, there is no longer functionally a Bureau for Humanitarian Assistance in USAID. The waivers from Secretary of State Rubio for emergency food and other urgent assistance are a smokescreen and farce if there is no one to make the awards happen,” a USAID official said.",
