  "content": "JERUSALEM/DOHA: Israeli soldiers killed a Palestinian in the West Bank on Sunday, a day after a deadly series of air strikes in the occupied territory as Qatar’s prime minister called on Israel and Hamas to immediately begin negotiating phase two of the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said on Sunday that a 73-year-old man had been killed by Israeli gunfire in the city’s adjacent refugee camp.\n\n“We demand (Hamas and Israel) to engage immediately as stipulated in the agreement,” Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani said at a press conference held jointly with Turkiye’s foreign minister in Qatari capital Doha on Sunday.\n\nWitnesses reported a “large” deployment of Israeli forces in the morning around the towns of Tubas and Tamun, southeast of Jenin.\n\nQatar’s prime minister calls on Hamas, Israel to begin immediate talks on Gaza ceasefire phase two\n\nAn AFP journalist said the army was blocking the exits of the nearby Faraa refugee camp and entering homes. Drones were also visible in the sky.\n\nThe Israeli army claimed early on Sunday that a “tactical group” had begun operations around Tamun and uncovered weapons.\n\nIt added it was “extending the counterterrorism operation… to five villages”.\n\nIt also distributed leaflets in Arabic saying the operation was meant to “eradicate armed criminals, the lackeys of Iran”.\n\nThe Israeli government accuses Iran, which backs armed groups across the Middle East including Hamas in Gaza, of attempting to send weapons and money to militants in the West Bank.\n\nDeadly strikes in Jenin\n\nOn Saturday, Israel conducted two air strikes in Jenin, and also “struck and eliminated a terrorist cell on its way to carry out an imminent terrorist attack” in Qabatiya, the military said, adding “two terrorists” were killed.\n\n“After the strike, secondary explosions due to explosives that were inside the vehicle were identified,” it said on Sunday.\n\nIslamic Jihad’s military wing confirmed in a statement on Sunday that two of its fighters were among those killed.\n\nThe military said one of those killed had been released from Israeli detention in 2023 as part of the first truce in the Gaza war.\n\nThe Palestinian health ministry said on Saturday evening that Israeli strikes in the Jenin area had killed five people, including a 16-year-old.\n\nAccording to the ceasefire agreement, negotiations on implementing the second phase of the deal should begin before the 16th day of phase one of the ceasefire, which is Monday.\n\nIsrael and Hamas last month reached a complex three-phase accord that has halted the fighting in Gaza.\n\nHamas has so far released 18 Israeli prisoners in exchange for Israel releasing hundreds of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons. There are more than 70 Israeli prisoners still held in Gaza.\n\nThe second stage of the accord is expected to include Hamas releasing all remaining Israeli prisoners held in Gaza, a permanent end to hostilities and the complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from the enclave.\n\n“There is nothing yet clear about where the delegations will come and when it’s going to take place,” the Qatar’s prime minister said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 3rd, 2025",
