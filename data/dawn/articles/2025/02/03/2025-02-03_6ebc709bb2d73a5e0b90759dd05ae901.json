We believe the PTI will not sit for talks in the near future as it has again adopted its previous strategy to hold street protests for the fulfilment of its demands,” Sena­tor Irfan Siddiqui, the committee’s spokesperson, told Dawn.\n\n“The PM has so far not dissolved the committee even though it is not functional anymore,” he added.\n\nThe premier visited Mr Sadiq’s residence in Lahore on Sunday. The meeting was also attended by NA Deputy Spea­ker Ghulam Mustafa Shah and MNAs Khursheed Shah and Shazia Marri, among others.\n\nWhile the meeting was officially to congratulate the deputy speaker on his son’s wedding, sources suggest that discussions also centred on the stalled dialogue process with the PTI.\n\nThe prime minister was briefed on PTI’s abrupt withdrawal from the talks after three rounds of discussions. The opposition party had issued a seven-day ultimatum for forming judicial commissions, which was not met, leading to their decision to boycott further negotiations.\n\nThe talks between the PML-N-led government and PTI began in late December to ease political tensions but saw little progress on major issues.\n\nAfter PTI threatened to quit the negotiations over the judicial commission issue, PM Shehbaz had offered to form a parliamentary committee three days ago to keep the talks intact. However, PTI rejected the proposal.\n\nThe prime minister also highlighted Pakistan’s improving economic indicators, citing growing investor confidence and collabor­ation between federal and provincial governments to address public welfare concerns.\n\nMohsin-Ayaz meeting\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi also met the National Assembly speaker in Islamabad on Sunday to discuss PTI’s “attitude” in the failed dialogue process and the country’s overall political situation.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Ministry of Interior, the two leaders expressed disappointment over PTI’s role despite what they called the government’s positive efforts to facilitate negotiations.\n\nThe interior minister lauded Mr Sadiq’s efforts in taking along “opposition and government parties together”, the statement added. “Ayaz Sadiq has played a commendable role in bringing together the government and opposition parties,” Mr Naqvi was quoted as saying.\n\nThe negotiation teams representing both sides comprised multiple political parties.\n\nThe government team included representatives from PML-N, PPP, MQM-P, PML-Z and Balochistan Awami Party.\n\nThe opposition team featured members of PTI, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen and Sunni Ittehad Council.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 3rd, 2025",
