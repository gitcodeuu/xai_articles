Both the Taliban and the UN were investigating the incident.\n\nKabul’s interior ministry spokesperson Abdul Mateen Qaniee confirmed that a Taliban guard was killed and one UN contractor suffered injuries.\n\nTaliban authorities halted all movement in and out of the compound following the incident, UNAMA said, but those restrictions have now been lifted.\n\nThe compound houses the offices of multiple UN agencies, funds and programmes, and accommodation for UN international staff members.",
