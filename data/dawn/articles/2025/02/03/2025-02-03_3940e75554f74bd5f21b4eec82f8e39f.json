More than 100 people have been convicted of the crimes.\n\nHowever, while most of the perpetrators in these particular cases were of mostly South Asian origin, a 2020 UK Home Office study said that “group-based child sexual exploitation offenders are most commonly white”.\n\nThe sexual abuse of British girls of South Asian origin is also unreported in the UK because authorities tend to focus on gangs that target white youngsters, according to a study prepared by the Muslim Women’s Network UK.\n\nIt said most of the victims were aged under 16 and two-thirds of them were from Pakistani families in the cases the group uncovered.\n\n“Of course, it’s still going on — I think it’s going on across every town, every city in the UK,” Jayne Senior, an early whistleblower about the problem, claimed to AFP.\n\nSenior is a former manager at Risky Business, a youth project set up in 1997 by the local authority in Rotherham, where an estimated 1,400 girls fell prey to the gangs.\n\nHer group helped almost 2,000 girls and boys at risk of being groomed, and she lodged a successful complaint against police for failing to act on evidence she presented.\n\n“There was physical, mental torture, trafficking and horrendous, horrendous abuse,” Senior said.\n\nAt the start of the group, “it tended to be predominantly girls 15 to 16, upwards. By 2012, what we saw is the majority of referrals were from about age 12,” she explained.\n\nShe frequently clashed with police and local authorities, accusing them of indifference.\n\n“We’d share telephone numbers, registration numbers, descriptions, names, dates of birth of those that we believed were harming, raping, trafficking our children.”\n\nThere was “very little response”, she said, adding: “We could have done so much more.”\n\nThe decline of the steel industry over recent decades has hit the town hard and more than one in four high street units now stand empty.\n\nTrauma over the grooming gang revelations still runs deep.\n\n“A friend … it happened to her daughter and she’s all over the place now with her mental health,” said Sandra Shirtliffe, 59.\n\nStanding outside the hair salon where she works, Claire, 50, also told AFP she knew one of the gang’s victims.\n\n“Sarah, whose sister was killed, she comes in for her hair done.”\n\nSarah Wilson was groomed by the town’s gangs as an 11-year-old and raped multiple times.\n\nHer younger sister Laura was murdered by her Pakistani boyfriend, who had treated white girls “as sexual targets”, the sentencing judge said.\n\nWhen asked why police were reluctant to pursue her leads, Senior said: “I’ve never been able to give a definitive answer.\n\n“What I can share with you is what was said at meetings. And it could be that these children were consenting.\n\n“How children consent to gang rape, I have no idea. Or they were in relationships, you know, 12-year-olds in relationships with 30-year-old men.”\n\nBut the majority of the time, police thought a jury would not believe the children “because some of the stories that they were sharing were so horrifying”.\n\n“Life’s been ruined in Rotherham,” former miner Ralph Spooner, 80, told AFP in the town’s indoor market.\n\n“There’s a lot of anger,” he added, saying he would like to see officials who ignored the grooming scandal “answer under oath” at a national inquiry.\n\n“It’s been swept under the carpet. There’s obviously something that’s not quite right,” added market stall holder Paula.\n\nA 2014 inquiry into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham found evidence of “blatant failures” by the authorities. Then-interior minister Theresa May denounced what she called “a complete dereliction of duty”.\n\nA 2015 report that also examined the case found there were victims of “Pakistani heritage” who did not necessarily report being sexually abused as they feared “it would affect their future marriage prospects”.\n\nThe current government under Prime Minister Keir Starmer has resisted calls for a national inquiry focused on the grooming gangs and says it will conduct a series of local probes.\n\nThe UK prime minister has called for “action” by implementing the 2022 report on the issue.\n\nInstead of showing contrition, Senior claims that the authorities have targeted those who spoke out.\n\nSenior and a colleague complained to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) in 2019 that senior local police officers had failed to protect children.\n\nThe complaint was upheld, but the IOPC refused to publish it.\n\n“We were told very clearly that if we published it … then the senior officers that we complained about would sue us,” claimed Senior.\n\nIOPC whistleblowers have revealed to AFP that Senior, who is demanding a wide-ranging national inquiry, was seen as a “bit of a pain”.\n\n“Not one senior professional in Rotherham has ever been held to account,” she said, and no officials have answered questions under oath.\n\n“Why was this allowed to happen? Why did it happen? Why did nobody do anything?” she asked.\n\n“A lot of these victims and survivors still do not have their answers.”",
