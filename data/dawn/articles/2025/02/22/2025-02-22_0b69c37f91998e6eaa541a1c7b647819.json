  "content": "PARIS: Paulo Dybala scored twice as Roma beat Porto on Thur­sday to clinch a place in the last 16 of the Europa League, while Ajax clawed through in extra time despite playing a man down for 95 minutes.\n\nSpanish forward Samu Aghehowa gave Porto the lead against Roma after a 1-1 draw in Portugal last week, but two quick-fire goals from Dybala turned the tie in favour of the 2023 runners-up.\n\nPorto were reduced to 10 men when Canada midfielder Stephen Eustaquio was sent off early in the second half, and Niccolo Pisilli struck what proved to be the crucial third goal for Claudio Ranieri’s men.\n\nDevyne Rensch turned into his own net deep into added time as Roma progressed 4-3 on aggregate.\n\n“Having a champion like Dybala means a lot. He’s extraordinary; he says very little, but he is a leader and always says the right things,” Ranieri told Sky Sport.\n\n“We have a huge opportunity in Europe. This competition can give us a lot this year,” said Dybala.\n\nFour-time European champions Ajax survived a huge scare against close neighbours Union Saint-Gill­oise of Belgium, nearly squandering a 2-0 advantage from a week ago.\n\nKevin Mac Allister’s header halved the deficit and Promise David tucked away a penalty after Ajax captain Davy Klaassen was dismissed in the 25th minute for a deliberate handball.\n\nBut Kenneth Taylor’s spot-kick in extra time was enough to put Ajax through 3-2 on aggregate.\n\nJose Mourinho, a former winner of the competition with Porto and Manchester United, saw his Fener­bahce side go through 5-2 overall after a 2-2 draw away to Anderlecht in a match that was delayed in the first half by crowd trouble.\n\nReal Sociedad thrashed Midt­jylland 7-3 on aggregate after a 5-2 win in San Sebastian.\n\nNorwegian champions Bodo/Glimt overturned a first leg deficit against Dutch side Twente with a dramatic 5-2 win after extra time in the Arctic Circle to progress 6-4 on aggregate.\n\nThe hosts were heading out before striking twice in second-half stoppage time but Twente then levelled the tie and forced extra time with a last-gasp equaliser.\n\nSondre Brunstad Fet put Bodo/Glimt back ahead in the 111th minute, with a second own goal of the night from Twente sealing qualification for their opponents.\n\nRobbie Keane’s Ferencvaros slid to a 3-0 loss at Viktoria Plzen, falling short after their 1-0 win last Thursday.\n\nAZ Alkmaar eased past Galata­saray 6-3 on aggregate despite conceding a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw in Turkey, while Romanians FCSB won 2-0 in Bucharest to complete a 4-1 aggregate win over PAOK of Greece.\n\nREAL BETIS MAKE LAST-16\n\nIn the Conference League, Real Betis moved into the last 16 despite a 1-0 loss in the return leg at home to Gent.\n\nBarcelona loanee Vitor Roque saw red before English defender Archie Brown’s late winner for Gent, but Betis went through 3-1 on aggregate.\n\nCopenhagen knocked out Heidenheim 4-3 over two legs after winning the return fixture 3-1 in Germany after extra time.\n\nIrish outfit Shamrock Rovers suffered penalty heartache as Molde prevailed 5-4 in the shootout after the tie ended 1-1. The Norwegians won 1-0 in Dublin after losing the first leg, with a goal from one-time United prospect Magnus Wolff Eikrem.\n\nPanathinaikos crushed Icelandic dreams as Tete’s 95th-minute goal earned the Greeks a 2-0 win over Vikingur Reykjavik in Athens and 3-2 victory overall.\n\nPafos won their all-Cypriot encounter with Omonia Nicosia.\n\nBosnia’s Borac Banja Luka squeezed past Olimpija Ljubljana 1-0 after a goalless stalemate in Slovenia, with Poland’s Jagiellonia Bialystok and Slovenians Celje moving on as well.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2025",
