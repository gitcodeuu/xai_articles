  "content": "KARACHI: The matter regarding water supply to the Cholistan canals project is pending before the Council of Common Interests (CCI), a top official said on Friday.\n\nIndus River System Authority (Irsa) Secretary Khalid Idrees Rana told DawnNewsTV that the authority had issued a water availability certificate (WAC) in January 2024.\n\nMedia reports aired on Friday suggested that Irsa had approved the supply of water to the controversial canals project, which has become a major bone of contention between Sindh and Punjab.\n\nHowever, no decision has been taken since the CCI has yet to be convened. Mr Rana said that the authority would now present its opinion before the forum.\n\nThe issue of the development of a new canal command had caused a stir in Sindh, when approval was granted for six new canals from the Indus last year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2025",
