Their strong data infrastructure and connection to the internet make them well-positioned to efficiently manage cloud services.\n\nHelps businesses improve scalability and efficiency\n\nKey players in Pakistan’s cloud industry include PTCL Cloud that offers a variety of cloud solutions for enterprises, including infrastructure, software and disaster recovery.\n\nPTCL Cloud infrastructure operates at tier-III data centre levels across multiple cities, ensuring high availability and redundancy.\n\nIt provides strong security and compliance with end-to-end encryption, firewalls, and multi-layered protection to secure enterprise data. PTCL also benefits from its nationwide fiber network, while its ‘Edge Computing & Connectivity’ ensures fast, low-latency cloud services.\n\nOther cloud services\n\nZong stands out as the only Business-Ready Cloud in Pakistan. While other providers offer basic cloud services, Zong Cloud is built differently, with stronger AI-based software and enhanced security against cyber threats.\n\nA senior official at the company said: “Data centres of all companies provide similar services; however, Zong has added ‘Future-Ready Innovation’ by investing in AI services.”\n\nThe official added: “Zong Cloud is Pakistan’s most advanced cloud platform due to its security, artificial intelligence, and innovation, which are the upcoming demands of users.”\n\nAnother key player in the field is Jazz Cloud that provides computing solutions focused on SMEs, startups, and enterprises. As one of the pioneers in the sector, Jazz operates data centres in Pakistan, enabling businesses to host applications, websites, and enterprise solutions securely.\n\nThe company’s venture into the cloud space has helped bolster its financial position following losses in the SMS and telephone services sectors. Jazz Cloud offers strong disaster recovery and backup solutions, partnering with global cloud providers.\n\nHuawei & Khazana Enterprise Cloud is Pakistan’s first hyper-scale financial platform. Launched in 2023 with an investment of $10 million, this cloud platform provides secure and locally hosted cloud solutions for financial institutions and businesses.\n\nA senior Huawei official said: “Our cloud services will strengthen in the coming years as the country moves toward 5G, and we have plans to further expand our cloud infrastructure.”\n\nA key feature of this cloud is to ensure that financial data stays within Pakistan to meet regulatory requirements.\n\nThe public sector also plays a role, with National Telecommunication Corporation (NTC) and SCO (state-owned telecom pro­­vider for AJK and Gilgit-Baltistan) offe­­ring data centres and cloud services for both public and private sector businesses. Their primary clients are government de­­partments and public sector enterprises.\n\nThe P@SHA chairman said the migration of businesses to cloud platforms is increasing, as companies look to enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs.\n\n“The main beneficiaries of cloud services will be public sector service departments, which cannot afford the finances or human resources to build their own data centres for each office located in different areas,” he added.\n\nHowever, Pakistan requires regulatory support to promote local cloud services. Investments in local cloud infrastructure will help reduce dependence on foreign hosting services.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2025",
