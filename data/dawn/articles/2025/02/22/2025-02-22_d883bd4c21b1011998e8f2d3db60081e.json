Later, the suspect was put in a private car for shifting him to the police station.\n\nIn the meantime, however, a dozen of people, including women, armed with butcher boning knives, axes, batons and pistols attacked the police team. They also resorted to firing at the police besides damaging the private (Cuore) car.\n\nOne of them attacked Head Constable Samiullah with a butcher boning knife and injured his right hand. They also smashed the windscreen of the car. Other residents of the area also came to assist the attackers to set the suspect free.\n\nLater, the attackers succeeded in setting the suspect free, who escaped from the spot. After getting the information, police patrolling teams reached the area and shifted the injured policeman to hospital.\n\nThis is the third incident in less than 10 days in which a suspect arrested by the police has escaped.\n\nOn Feb 12, a man arrested in connection with a murder allegedly committed by him along with his accomplices after abducting the victim on January 20 from Nilore escaped from the lock-ups after breaking its locks. The suspect was on physical remand and detained at the Banigala police station instead of Nilore police station where he had allegedly committed the crime.\n\nOver his escape, a case was registered against six police officials, including the SHO, station clerk (Moharrar), deputy station clerk (naib moharrar) and an assistant sub-inspector.\n\nOn Feb 16, a handcuffed suspect arrested for alleged drug peddling escaped from custody. The Khanna police had arrested the suspect and were shifting him to jail on judicial remand.\n\nOn the way to the jail, they stopped at a photocopy shop in front of the Koral police station from where the handcuffed suspect escaped.\n\nA written directive, “Instruction regarding transfer of suspects to lockups and jail” issued from the office of the deputy inspector general of police to the senior superintendent of police and other concerned officers stated that several verbal instructions had been issued regarding lock-ups of police stations.\n\n“But due to the lack of attention and negligence, incidents of suspects escaping from police custody are happening every day,” it said, adding the main reason behind such incidents was the lack of interest and irresponsibility of officers and officials in their duties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2025",
