But despite weeks of negotiations, the dialogue process stalled on two major issues — the formation of two judicial commissions and the release of PTI prisoners.\n\nCiting the delay in forming the probe bodies, the PTI decided to boycott the fourth round of talks scheduled at the end of January. After the negotiations remained in limbo, both sides have continued trading barbs against each other.\n\nResponding to a question about PTI leader Shahbaz Gill, who is abroad currently, Malik said in an interview on DawnNewsTV programme ‘Doosra Rukh’ on Friday: “Interpol has been contacted by the interior ministry regarding these cases.”\n\nMalik said: “Those who want to harm Pakistan by sitting outside [and protesting] will be brought back to Pakistan, whether through extradition or repatriation.\n\n“Government has zero tolerance on this,” he added.\n\nWhen asked if it included PTI protesters, Malik said, “If they (protesters) are holding anti-state agenda without substantiating evidence […] Action will be taken against them in the coming days.”\n\nThe PM’s adviser said that people who protested abroad were “creating problems” for themselves in Pakistan.\n\nPunjab Information Minister Azma Bokhari yesterday said that the PTI held a protest in London during Chief of Army Staff Gen Asim Munir’s recent visit there.\n\n“About 50 PTI supporters protested the army chief’s visit, aligning with the agendas of foreign agencies. Despite claiming to represent overseas Pakistanis, every call made by PTI has been decisively rejected by them,” Bokhari claimed.\n\nThe same day, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif assailed the PTI once again, saying that the party’s relevance would end soon because of its “violence-inciting politics”.\n\nPetroleum Min­i­ster Dr Musadik Malik also ruled out holding any talks with the PTI on pardoning its founder Imran Khan in the Al-Qadir Trust case, in which the ex-premier and his wife have been sentenced to 14 years in jail.\n\nSeparately, while speaking later in the show, PTI Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram said that the decision to negotiate with the Afghan Taliban was the government’s domain, adding that it was not only the provincial government’s decision.\n\n“This is happening with everyone’s agreement. Do you think they (the provincial government) can do it (negotiations) just like that?” questioned Akram.\n\n“This is the domain of the federal government, [why] would the provincial government act on their own,” he added.\n\nIn response to Barrister Malik’s claim, the PTI leader said that representatives from the government, including the interior minister and the army chief, were present in the meeting where the decosion was taken.\n\n“You can ask him [Naqvi], you can ask the army chief as well.”\n\n“Why would the provincial government do something without taking someone in confidence?” he added.",
