  "content": "RIYADH: Arab leaders met in Riyadh on Friday to craft a plan for Gaza’s post-war reconstruction to counter Donald Trump’s proposal for the United States to take over the territory without its Palestinian inhabitants.\n\nTrump’s plan has united Arab states in opposition to it, but disagreements remain over who should govern Gaza and how its reconstruction can be funded.\n\nAn image published on Saudi state television showed the kingdom’s de facto leader Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman with the leaders of other Gulf Arab states, Egypt and Jordan.\n\nA source close to the Saudi government confirmed the meeting had finished but the hosts did not immediately publish a final statement.\n\nUS president’s move has united Arab states in their opposition\n\nEgyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi’s office said he had left the Saudi capital after the meeting with the leaders of Bahrain, Jordan, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n\nA Saudi source had earlier told AFP that the Palestinian Authority was also expected to take part in the talks.\n\nTrump triggered global outrage when he proposed the United States “take over” the Gaza Strip and relocate its more than two million residents to Egypt and Jordan.\n\n‘Egyptian plan’\n\n“We’re at a very important historic juncture in the Arab-Israeli or Israeli-Palestinian conflict… where potentially the United States under Trump could create new facts on the ground that are irreversible,” Andreas Krieg of King’s College London said ahead of the meeting.\n\nThe Saudi source had told AFP that the summit participants would discuss “a reconstruction plan to counter Trump’s plan for Gaza”.\n\nThe Gaza Strip is largely in ruins after more than 15 months of war between Israel and Hamas, with the United Nations recently estimating that reconstruction will cost more than $53 billion.\n\nDuring a meeting with Trump in Washington on February 11, Jordan’s King Abdullah II said Egypt would present a plan for a way forward.\n\nThe Saudi source said the delegates would discuss “a version of the Egyptian plan”.\n\nThe official Saudi Press Agency said the decisions taken at the “unofficial fraternal meeting” would be put on the agenda of an emergency Arab League summit to be held in Egypt on March 4.\n\nFinancing\n\nArab leaders see an alternative plan for Gaza’s reconstruction as essential after Trump pointed to the scale of the task as a justification for relocating its Palestinian inhabitants.\n\nCairo has yet to release the details of its proposal, but former Egyptian diplomat Mohamed Hegazy outlined a plan “in three technical phases over a period of three to five years”.\n\nThe first phase, lasting six months, would focus on “early recovery” and the removal of debris, he said.\n\nThe second would require an international conference to set out detailed plans for reconstruction and restoring infrastructure.\n\nThe final phase would see the provision of housing and services and the establishment of a “political track to implement the two-state solution”, an independent Palestine alongside Israel.\n\nAn Arab diplomat familiar with Gulf affairs said: “The biggest challenge facing the Egyptian plan is how to finance it. It would be inconceivable for Arab leaders to meet without reaching a common vision, but the main thing lies in the content of this vision and the ability to implement it.”\n\nKrieg said it was a “unique opportunity” for the “Saudis to rally all the other GCC countries, plus Egypt and Jordan, around on this matter, to find a common position to answer what is a kind of very coercive statement that Trump has been making”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2025",
