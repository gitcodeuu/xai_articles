  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Students and companions of former Lal Masjid cleric Maulana Abdul Aziz and his wife Ume Hassan on Friday blocked roads in the federal capital, causing great inconvenience to the residents and motorists alike.\n\nThe protesters blocked the roads during hours-long protests that started shortly after Friday prayers, condemning the arrest of firebrand religious figure Ume Hassan.\n\nThe protesters, a majority of them minors, blocked Lal Masjid Municipal Road, Aabpara Chowk and Srinagar Highway near the Jinnah Sports Complex, which led to suspension of traffic. After getting the information about the law and order situation at the three places, police contingents were deployed to the areas to avoid any untoward incident.\n\nOver 100 people including at least 50 teenage and minor girls staged the protest on Srinagar Highway, while about 60 people blocked Aabpara Chowk.\n\nPolicewomen were also deployed on Municipal Road near Lal Masjid where over five dozen women blocked the road.\n\nThe protesters demanded the release of Ume Hassan, arrested in connection with an attack on police, CDA staff and labourers during the construction of a religious seminary in Margalla Town on Wednesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2025",
