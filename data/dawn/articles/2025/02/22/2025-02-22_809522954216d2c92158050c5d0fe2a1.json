  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government has extended the contract of Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) chairman Masroor Khan for a year, effective Feb 23, apparently violating the Ogra Act.\n\nIn a notification on Friday, the Cabinet Division said the government, under Section 3 (8) (a) Ogra Ordinance 2002, extended the contractual appointment of Masroor Khan till Feb 22, 2026.\n\nHowever, there is no provision for a one-year extension for the Ogra chairman in the said section of the act.\n\nSection 8 (a) says that subject to sub-section (9) “the chairman shall be appointed by the Federal Government for an initial term of four years and shall be eligible for reappointment for a similar term while the sub-section 9 says “the chairman and the other members shall retire on attaining the age of 65 years”.\n\nMr Masroor is the only chairman of any regulatory body in the country who is drawing a special professional pay scale (SPPS). SPPS all inclusive maximum remuneration works out at Rs2 million.\n\nOther members of the Ogra have MP-scales at present “almost half that of their chairman. Interestingly, the special package for chairman Ogra was approved to attract a former officer who passed away before the appointment.\n\nThe incumbent chairman has been successful in thwarting an advertisement seeking fresh appointment despite a tradition that the process of fresh appointment for members and chairmen of all regulators should begin three months before the vacancy of the post.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2025",
