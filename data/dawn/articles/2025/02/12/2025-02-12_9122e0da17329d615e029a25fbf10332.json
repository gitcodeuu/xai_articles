  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) on Tuesday declared the recent elections of the Paki­stan Weightlifting Federation (PWF) null and void, citing violations of Islamabad High Court’s orders.\n\nIn a letter addressed to provincial sports boards, departments and other stakeholders, the PSB stated that a group led by Hafiz Imran Butt conducted unauthorised elections on Feb 1, 2025, at the Olympic House in Lahore.\n\n“These elections have no legal standing as they we­re conducted despite the suspension of the PWF by the PSB on the basis of doping charges,” the letter read.\n\nThe elections were also held without the involvement of the Election Commission appointed by the PSB, which is a direct violation of the Islamabad High Court’s judgment in writ petition (2254/2022).\n\nThe court had explicitly directed that no elections should be held until the notification of the Election Commission by the PSB.\n\nFurthermore, government departments — who give employment to a significant number of weightlifters — did not participate in the elections, which “further invalidates the legitimacy of these so-called elections”.\n\nThe PSB warned government departments not to collaborate with the unauthorised group led by Imran Butt, which falsely claims to represent the PWF.\n\n“In case any employee of the departments is found involved in activities, events or elections organised by this group, the department concerned may take appropriate action against such an employee as per its rules and regulations.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 12th, 2025",
