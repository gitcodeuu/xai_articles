  "content": "LAHORE: PML-N leader Khwaja Saad Rafique has drawn the attention of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi towards the nefarious crime of human trafficking asking him to take immediate notice of this.\n\n“The tragic incidents of Pakistanis drowning at sea while falling into the trap of illegal migration to Europe are increasing. Human traffickers continue their vile business without fear,” Rafique said on X on Tuesday.\n\nHe said a “strong and effective” crackdown by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) against these inhumane criminals was now essential and must continue until they were completely eradicated.\n\n“The ministry of interior needs to take urgent notice of this?” he asked.\n\nMeanwhile, the crackdown on human traffickers continued as the FIA Lahore arrested 46 suspects and registered 153 cases against them during a month or so.\n\n“Among the arrested suspects are most-wanted fugitives and traffickers involved in boat tragedies,” an FIA Lahore spokesperson said on Tuesday.\n\nHe said that charge sheets for 58 cases had been submitted to courts. In 13 cases, courts had convicted and sentenced the suspects, he added.\n\n“All available resources are being utilised to arrest the culprits. Intelligence-based operations are ongoing to apprehend human traffickers,” said FIA Lahore Director Sarfaraz Virk.\n\nHe said illegal migration was a game of death, urging the people to choose a legal and safe route to travel abroad.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 12th, 2025",
