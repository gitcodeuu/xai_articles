  "content": "The Islamic State (IS) group claimed a suicide bombing at a bank in northern Afghanistan that killed eight people, saying on Wednesday it was targeting Taliban government employees collecting salaries the previous day.\n\nViolence has waned in Afghanistan since the Taliban surged back to power and ended their insurgency in 2021 but IS frequently stages gun and bomb attacks challenging their rule.\n\nA suicide bomber attacked the front of a bank in the northern city of Kunduz on Tuesday, with the interior ministry raising the death toll on Wednesday from five to eight.\n\nThe IS propaganda wing said on Wednesday a suicide bomber had “detonated his explosive vest” as “Taliban militia members gathered outside a public bank to collect their salaries”.\n\nThe group previously claimed responsibility for a similar bombing in March 2024 outside a bank in the southern city of Kandahar, which is considered the spiritual heartland of the Taliban movement.\n\nIS said it had targeted “Taliban militia” members outside the bank. Taliban authorities said only three people had been killed in last year’s incident but a hospital source put fatalities far higher at 20.\n\nThe Taliban government has declared security its highest priority since returning to power and analysts say they have had some success quashing IS with a sweeping crackdown. But the group remains active, targeting Taliban officials, visitors from abroad, and foreign diplomats.\n\nThere are frequently discrepancies between the casualty tolls given by Taliban authorities and those reported by officials on the ground, and attack sites are routinely shut down by security forces.\n\nIS claimed responsibility for a suicide bombing that killed the Taliban government’s minister for refugees, Khalil Rahman Haqqani, in the capital Kabul in December.",
