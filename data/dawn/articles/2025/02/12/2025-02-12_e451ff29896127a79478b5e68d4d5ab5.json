He said that this would require regulation which fosters AI development “rather than strangles it”. Vance added that leaders in Europe should especially “look to this new frontier with optimism, rather than trepidation”.\n\nHis comments appear to put him at odds with French President Emman­uel Macron, who defended the need for further regulation. “We need these rules for AI to move forward,” Macron said at the summit, according to the BBC.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 12th, 2025",
