The next morning, we found her dead.”\n\nThe victim’s mother added that the girl’s uncle and father planned to kill her, further alleging that the uncle forcefully fed her wheat laced with poison. “In the presence of everyone in the house, he announced ‘We needed to kill the girl to preserve our honour’,” the mother said in her statement.\n\nThe suspects were charged under Sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender), 302 (punishment for murder) and 311 — which specifies the penalties that can be awarded by a judge regardless of whether or not a compromise has been reached in a case of murder — of the Pakistan Penal Code.\n\nIn Pakistan, ‘honour’ killings continued to claim the lives of women throughout 2024, perpetuated by deeply ingrained societal beliefs about family dignity and shame.\n\nData from the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) showed that in 2024, ‘honour’ killings continued to be a serious issue across Pakistan, with particularly high figures in Sindh and Punjab. From January to November, a total of 346 people were killed due to ‘honour’ crimes in the country.",
