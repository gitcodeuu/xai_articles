  "content": "Salman Ali Agha and Mohammad Rizwan both struck centuries as Pakistan completed their highest successful run chase in One Day Internationals with a six-wicket win over South Africa in a Tri-Nation Series fixture in Karachi on Wednesday.\n\nSouth Africa, without several first-team regulars, batted first on a flat wicket and with a lightning-quick outfield, amassing 352 for five in their 50 overs on the back of half-centuries from captain Temba Bavuma (82), Matthew Breetzke (83) and Heinrich Klaasen (87).\n\nPakistan were 91-3 in reply, but a magnificent 260-run fourth wicket stand between Agha (134), who scored his maiden ODI tonne, and Mohammad Rizwan (122 not out) took Pakistan to victory with six balls to spare.\n\nIt beats their previous highest successful run chase of 349 against Australia in Lahore in 2022 and will provide a boost in confidence as they prepare to host the Champions Trophy starting in a week.\n\nPakistan play New Zealand in the Tri-Nations final in Karachi on Friday.",
