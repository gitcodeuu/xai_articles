  "content": "PESHAWAR: A controversy has emerged over Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Governor Faisal Kareem Kundi’s contradictory stand on granting assent to two recently-passed bills while publicly claiming to have rejected them.\n\nOn Feb 7, he approved the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Employees (Removal from Service) Bill, 2025, and KP Agricultural Income Tax Bill, 2025, but recorded objections to both laws at the same time.\n\nBoth bills were passed by the provincial assembly recently before the assembly secretariat sent them to the governor for assent.\n\nMr Kundi and the Governor’s House have claimed in media talks that both bills had been rejected.\n\nDocuments reject Kundi’s public statements, show he signed off on both bills while recording observations\n\nTalking to reporters in his native town Dera Ismail Khan on Monday, the governor said that he had turned down the KP Employees (Removal from Service) Bill, 2025, and returned it to the speaker for review.\n\nHe insisted that when hundreds of employees were hired for different departments during the last caretaker government, there was no recruitment ban by the Election Commission of Pakistan.\n\nMr Kundi also said that even if those recruitments were illegal, why the current government didn’t act against the appointing authorities?\n\nHe regretted that the senior officials, who green-lit those appointments, continued to hold key positions, while “the poor” were being penalised.\n\nHowever, documents, available with Dawn, contradict Mr Kundi’s public statements by showing that he actually signed off on both bills while formally recording his observations.\n\n“I hereby give my assent to the bill in fulfilment of my constitutional duty under clause 5 of the Article 115 read with Article 116 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973. However, I must highlight certain shortcomings in the legislation that could undermine its objectives and infringe upon the rights of citizens. These issues, if addressed, would strengthen the bill and ensure its alignment with constitutional values,” the governor noted in his formal assent to KP Employees (Removal from Service) Bill, 2025.\n\nSimilarly, the Governor’s House released a statement, insisting that Mr Kundi has rejected the KP Agricultural Income Tax Bill, 2025, declaring it unacceptable and an injustice to farmers.\n\nHe added that growers from across the province were protesting the legislation, with the government opening another gateway of corruption through it.\n\nWhile giving assent to the KP Agricultural Income Tax Bill, 2025, the governor noted, “I hereby give my assent to the bill in fulfilment of my constitutional duty under Clause 5 of the Article 115, read with Article 116 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. However, I believe the following issues require careful consideration to ensure the legislation aligns with constitutional principles, promotes compliance and supports the agricultural community.”\n\nIn an observation on that bill, the governor said, “Income from livestock could have been included in the scope of Agriculture Income Tax as the Punjab has done. Including livestock income would not only increase revenue but also align the province’s tax regime with best practices in other regions.”\n\nHe added that the bill overlooked the issue of pending land settlements by the board of revenue, particularly in war-affected areas of the province.\n\nMr Kundi warned that without resolving those disputes, imposition of taxes on such lands could lead to legal challenges and administrative complications.\n\n“The bill should include provisions to exempt or defer taxation on lands under dispute until their ownership is conclusively determined,” reads the governor’s note.\n\nInterestingly, mainstream media, including newspapers and television channels, reported rejection of both bills by the governor.\n\nHowever, sources told Dawn that the actual reason for the issue was political rivalry between PTI and Pakistan Peoples Party.\n\nA senior official at the assembly secretariat claimed that they received assented bills on Tuesday and forwarded them to the speaker.\n\n“With the assent of the governor, both bills have become laws,” he said.\n\nThe governor was not available for comments despite multiple attempts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 12th, 2025",
