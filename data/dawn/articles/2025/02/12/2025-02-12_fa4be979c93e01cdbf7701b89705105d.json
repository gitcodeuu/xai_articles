  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has withdrawn its notification that made the participation of defence analysts in TV shows conditional on approval from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), leading to the disposal of a case against it.\n\nThe Islamabad High Court bench, headed by Justice Babar Sattar, was hearing the petition against Pemra filed by retired colonel Inamur Rahim when the court was informed about Pemra’s decision to revoke the notification.\n\nThe notification had been challenged by the petitioner on the grounds of media freedom and the right to free speech.\n\nIn response, Justice Sattar noted that since the petitioner was satisfied with the withdrawal of the notification by Pemra, there was no need for further proceedings.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 12th, 2025",
