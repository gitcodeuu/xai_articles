Since the sample was collected in Dece­m­­ber last year, the case has been categorised as part of last year’s tally,” the official had stated.\n\nThe incubation period for the sample is nearly three weeks, which can extend further during the winter season, accor­ding to the official.\n\nThe country reported a total of 74 cases in 2024. Of these, 27 were found in Balochistan, 23 in Sindh, 22 in Khyber Pakhtun­khwa, and one each in Punjab and Islamabad.\n\nSo far, in 2025, only one polio case has been found and that is in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan area, the official said.\n\nThe Pakistan Polio Progra­mme conducts multiple mass vaccination drives each year, bringing the vaccine directly to children’s doorsteps.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 12th, 2025",
