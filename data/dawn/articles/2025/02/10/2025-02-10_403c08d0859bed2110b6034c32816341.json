The man was later shifted to hospital with a bullet injury to his leg.\n\nThe police have arrested the constable.\n\nWOMAN MURDERED: A woman was found murdered under mysterious circumstances in her house in Sanda area here on Sunday. Identified as Rida, the woman was found with her throat slit with a sharp-edged weapon.\n\nThe police inquiries suggested that she was living in the upper portion of the house and her husband, Shamshad, was at his job when she was found murdered.\n\nHowever, the police took her husband into custody over suspicion as circumstantial evidence showed no outsider or stranger could enter the upper portion of the house without being noticed.\n\nSharing details, the Lahore police spokesperson said the in-laws of the deceased woman were residing in the lower portion of the building that had one entrance, and there were no signs of any forced entry.\n\nQuoting initial investigations, the spokesperson said the woman was murdered between midnight and 3am, while the victim’s husband was working in the night shift, from 9pm to 9am, in a factory.\n\nHowever, on the night of the incident, the suspect visited his house twice, first at 11pm and then around 1am, claiming that he had brought a burger for his wife. Because of his unusual activity, the police developed suspicion and took Shamshad into custody for questioning. The body was shifted to the city morgue for autopsy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 10th, 2025",
