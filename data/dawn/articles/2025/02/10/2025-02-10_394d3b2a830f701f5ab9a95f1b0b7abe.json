The trip was aimed at strengthening bilateral strategic partnership and economic ties.\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari on Monday held a meeting with Erdogan during a brief stopover at Istanbul Airport en route to Portugal.\n\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan warmly received the president at the airport.\n\nZardari and his Turkish counterpart discussed bilateral ties and matters of mutual interest during their meeting.\n\nPresident Zardari is currently on a visit to Portugal to express condolences on the passing of Prince Karim Aga Khan and meet with Prince Rahim Al-Husseini, who was named the 50th hereditary imam following his father’s death.",
