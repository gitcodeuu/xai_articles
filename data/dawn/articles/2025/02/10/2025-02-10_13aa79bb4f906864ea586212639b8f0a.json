  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has sought a report on an alleged design flaw in the under-construction Jinnah Avenue underpass.\n\nThe issue came into the spotlight when media reports pointed out apparent flaws in the design of the underpass.\n\nHowever, a CDA official denied the reported defect. Through an official letter dated February 6, the Prime Minister’s Office directed the CDA to submit its report on the issue to the premier at the earliest.\n\nA sharp loop in the underpass has raised question marks on the design of the project, as motorists are worried about the potential gridlocks as a three-lane road abruptly converts into two after entering the underpass.\n\nJinnah Avenue, travelling from F-10 towards D-Chowk, has three lanes but the newly-built loop eats into one of them.\n\nThe loop itself seems problematic because of its dog-leg bend and the concrete wall right after it.\n\nIt is feared that heavier vehicles will not be able to use this smoothly. The underpass is part of the Jinnah Avenue Interchange project worth Rs4.2 billion. The project has two components - an underpass and a flyover.\n\nThe underpass was completed in a record 42 days and inaugurated by the prime minister while CDA is all set to complete the flyover this week.\n\nMeanwhile, CDA officials believe there was no fault in the design of the underpass and it was constructed “as per international standards”.\n\nCDA’s member engineering Syed Nafasat Raza said there was no flaw in the design of the loop.\n\n“The width of the loop is 30 feet with no height restriction. All types of vehicles can use it smoothly… the loop was designed in accordance with international engineering standards,” he claimed and added that some safety measures will be taken such as colouring of lanes and direction boards.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 10th, 2025",
