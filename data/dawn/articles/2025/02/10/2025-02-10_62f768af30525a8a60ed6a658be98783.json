  "content": "Bulls took over the trading floor at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as shares climbed more than 1,000 points on Monday after a week of persistent institutional selling.\n\nThe benchmark KSE-100 index surged 1055.03 points, or 0.96 per cent, to stand at 111,377.96 points from the previous close of 110,322.93.\n\nMohammed Sohail, chief executive of Topline Securities, while speaking to Dawn.com attributed the bullish momentum to “better-than-expected corporate results helping the market”.\n\nHe added that the “first IPO of 2025” also signalled positive market sentiments.\n\nAccording to a market review by Topline Securities, “The uptick was largely driven by strong performances from MARI, ENGROH, HUBC, PPL, and ATRL, which collectively contributed 448 points to the index.”\n\nThe market activity remained strong, it said, adding that 409 million shares were traded and a total turnover of Rs23.8 billion.\n\n“BOP [Bank of Punjab] led the volume charts, with 55.9m shares changing hands,” it said.\n\nAccording to a press release, Zarea Limited “is set to go public”, raising Rs1bn through its Initial Public Offering (IPO).\n\nLast week, the stock market remained under pressure for the third consecutive week on persistent institutional selling driven by renewed concerns over significant shortfalls in tax revenues against the collection projection and an inordinate delay in debt rollovers.\n\nThese issues are particularly worrisome ahead of the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) review later this month, leaving investors anxious without any positive developments.\n\nHowever, the government hopes for a successful IMF review, which would lead to the release of a second tranche under the 37-month $7bn Ext­ended Fund Facility, which is crucial to meeting the country’s external debt repayment obligations.\n\nOn the economic front, the headline inflation for January dropped to a 101-month low of 2.4pc year-on-year. The trade deficit widened by 18pc to $2.3bn in January. The petroleum sales remained stable at 1.38m tonnes in January, with 8pc month-on-month growth. The cement despatches increased by 14pc to 3.89m tonnes in the first month of 2025. Meanwhile, the urea and DAP sales declined by 27pc and 6pc year-on-year, respectively.\n\nThe SBP reserves increased by $46m to $11.4bn week-on-week.",
