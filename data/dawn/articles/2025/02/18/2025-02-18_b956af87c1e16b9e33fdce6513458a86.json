  "content": "RIYADH: A planned Saudi meeting of Arab leaders in response to US President Donald Trump’s plan to take control of Gaza has been postponed by a day and expanded to include five more countries, Arab diplomats said on Monday.\n\n“The mini Arab summit in Riyadh has been postponed from Thursday to Friday, Feb 21,” a Saudi source said. An Arab diplomatic source later confirmed the new date.\n\nThree Arab states had been expected to attend the summit, but the Saudi source said the expanded meeting will “include the leaders of the six Gulf Cooperation Council countries along with Egypt and Jordan to discuss Arab alternatives to Trump’s plans in the Gaza Strip”.\n\nThe member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council are the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar and Kuwait.\n\nThe Saudi source said that “an influential Gulf country expressed its dissatisfaction at being excluded from the Riyadh summit, which prompted the organisers to include all the Gulf countries”, without specifying which country was involved.\n\nInstead of three, eight countries including GCC members, to attend summit on 21st\n\nTrump had proposed taking over the war-batted Gaza Strip and moving its more than two million residents to Jordan or Egypt — a plan experts say would violate international law.\n\nArab countries have unanimously rejected the idea or any prospect of displacing Palestinians from their lands.\n\nUS Secretary of State Marco Rubio earlier on Thursday said Washington was open to proposals from Arab countries concerning the Palestinian territory, where a fragile ceasefire came into effect on Jan 19 after more than 15 months of fighting.\n\nRubio said he hoped to be able to discuss these ideas during a tour that took him to Israel on Sunday, Saudi Arabia on Monday, and then to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nLast week, Jordan’s King Abdullah II met Trump at the White House and “reiterated Jordan’s steadfast position against the displacement of Palestinians”, according to a statement issued later, saying this was “the unified Arab position”.\n\nTrump doubled down on his plan during the meeting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 18th, 2025",
