However, when the autopsy exposed marks of injuries, the police began investigating the incident as a suspected murder case.\n\nHyderabad Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Dr Farrukh Ali said a day ago that the poet’s adopted son had confessed to the murder and the police had recovered the weapon used in the offence.\n\nThe suspect was produced in the court of ATC Judge Ubaidullah Khan today where the Bhitai Nagar police requested a four-day physical remand that was granted by the judge.\n\nBhitai Nagar police had registered the case under Sections 201 (causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 302 (premeditated murder) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 (punishment for acts of terrorism) of the Anti-Terrorism Act against the adopted son for the poet’s murder.\n\nIbrahim Jan Ansari, a relative of the deceased, had lodged the case.",
