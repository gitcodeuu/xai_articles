He also de­­fended the government’s proposed role in the governance of universities, saying there must be a third party check to ensure quality.\n\nThe conference was attended by 32 VCs while prominent business leaders, members of the VC Search Committee, and senior officials from HED and PHEC were also present.\n\nNUST founding rector retired Lt Gen Muhammad Asghar and Sui No­­r­­thern Gas Pipelines Limited’s BOD Chairman Muhammad Ismail Qure­shi and educationist Sohail Na­­qvi in their speeches discussed different problems facing the universities.\n\nThey said universities should be given complete autonomy in all matters and training programmes sho­­uld be launched to improve administration. They suggested appointing regular registrars and controller of examinations and starting quality enhancing centres on the campuses. They proposed that teachers should not be made heads of such centres.\n\nThe speakers said that VCs should head syndicates while registrar should serve as their secretary. Senates and board of governors (BoG) should be increased, they said, adding that members from the business community, eminent scholars, industry leaders and philanthropists should be included in it.\n\nVCs’ proposals\n\nThe conference had developed groups of VCs to obtain recommendations to address issues of governance, academic quality, financial management and curriculum alignment with national requirements.\n\nThe VCs presented several recommendations, including providing autonomy to universities to run its affairs and oversee funds. They suggested that the government should amend the acts of those universities where there is no Senate.\n\nThe said the government should develop a Senate in universities inc­luding all women universities, Oka­ra, Layyah, Sialkot, Gujrat, Faisal­ab­­ad, Ghazi, Bhakkar, and others and make the chief minister or minister for higher education its chairman.\n\nIt may be recalled that under the 1973 Universities Act, the governor is the chancellor as well as the head of the Senate. However, new recommendations made at the moot suggest that the chief minister or the minister for higher education should be made the chancellor.\n\nThey proposed that the government should give syndicate chairmanship to the VCs rather than giving it to the minister in the new universities and also complete other bodies of these campuses.\n\nHowever, a senior official while talking to Dawn on condition of anonymity said the government was planning to amend laws of all the universities of the province.\n\nThe conference proposed amendments to several sections of laws. The recommendations include chan­ging the Universities Acts and making the chief minister, minister of higher education and HED secretary as head of the Syndicates and removing the VCs from chairmanship. The CM will head the Syndicate and in its absence minister for higher education or HED secretary would head it.\n\nSeveral VCs on condition of anonymity told Dawn that the government was trying to end all types of autonomy of the universities by trying to change the law.\n\nA source said that teachers would resist any such move and would not al­low ending the universities’ autonomy.\n\nThe source apprehended that the government would try to approve the recommendations in the PHEC meeting on Tuesday (today).\n\nAccording to the source, all the VCs rejected the recommendations made at the conference and their opinion was presented to the minister.\n\nMinister’s call\n\nEarlier, Punjab Minister for Scho­­ol and Higher Education Rana Sika­ndar Hayat in his address said that VCs would be removed from chairmanship of the Syndicates which should be given to third party for their evaluation in running the universities’ affairs. He emphasised that public-private partnerships, international grants, and endowment funds are being encouraged to enhance the financial sustainability of varsities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 18th, 2025",
