  "content": "Iran has charged British couple Craig and Lindsay Foreman with espionage, accusing them of collaborating with Western intelligence services, following their arrest last month, the judiciary said on Tuesday.\n\nJudiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said the pair were alleged to have entered Iran “posing as tourists” and gathered information before their arrest in the southeastern province of Kerman.\n\nThe judiciary’s Mizan Online website quoted Kerman chief justice Ebrahim Hamidi as saying the couple’s links to foreign intelligence services had been confirmed.\n\n“Additional investigations are still ongoing,” Hamidi added.\n\nJahangir was quoted as saying they had been taken into custody by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps on “espionage charges”.\n\nThe Foremans were accused of gathering “information from several provinces” and “cooperating with covert institutions linked to the intelligence services of hostile and Western countries”, the spokesman said.\n\nThe BBC had reported that the couple were in their early 50s and on a motorbike trip around the world when they were detained in January.\n\nAccording to social media posts, they crossed into Iran from Armenia in December and were gradually making their way to Australia.\n\nOn Friday, Britain’s Foreign Office said it was “providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran” and was in contact with Iranian authorities.\n\nLast week, Iran’s official IRNA news agency said British ambassador Hugo Shorter met with the couple at the Kerman prosecutor’s office.\n\nThe agency also published a photo of the meeting, with the couple’s faces blurred.\n\nThe British government advises against all travel to Iran.\n\nSeveral other Europeans are held in custody in Iran, which has conducted multiple prisoner exchanges with Western governments in recent years.\n\nIn January 2023, Iran announced the execution of British-Iranian dual citizen Alireza Akbari, prompting outrage among Western governments including Britain which called it “barbaric”.\n\nAkbari had been convicted of spying for Britain.\n\nIn January, Iran released Italian journalist Cecilia Sala who was arrested the month before for “violating the law of the Islamic Republic”.\n\nHer release came days before Italy freed Iranian national Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested in Milan in December at the behest of the United States.\n\nThe US had accused him of violating US sanctions and supplying sophisticated drone navigation technology to Iran’s military. Iran had denied any link between Sala and Abedini’s cases.\n\nFrench couple Cecile Kohler and Jacques Paris have been jailed since May 2022 on charges of espionage, a capital offence in Iran.\n\nIn June, Iran released two Swedes, one of them a European Union diplomat, in exchange for a former official held in Sweden, in a swap mediated by Oman.\n\nIn 2023, Oman also brokered the release of six European detainees in Iran, including Belgian aid worker Olivier Vandecasteele, who had been convicted of espionage and spent more than a year in custody.",
