We want to increase and diversify India-Qatar trade linkages,” Modi said in a post on X. It was the first such visit by a Qatari Emir to the South Asian nation in 10 years.\n\nAccording to the statement, Qatar will invest $10bn in India in infrastructure, technology, manufacturing, food security, logistics, hospitality and other sectors.\n\nThe two countries will aim to double their annual trade to $28bn in the next five years and are exploring the signing of a free trade agreement, the Indian foreign ministry said earlier in the day.\n\nBilateral trade between the two nations stood at $18.77bn in the fiscal year that ended in March 2023, mainly comprising liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports from Qatar.\n\nQatar accounted for more than 48 per cent of India’s LNG imports that year.\n\nThe two sides said they would work to enhance bilateral energy cooperation, including mutual investments in energy infrastructure, as well as look at the settlement of bilateral trade in their respective currencies.",
