However, we don’t know the circumstances surrounding it at this point,” said a police official in the state of Ontario.\n\n“It is my understanding that most of the passengers are out and unharmed, but we’re still trying to make sure so we’re still on scene investigating,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 18th, 2025",
