Therefore, the government is not responsible for its constant loss-making,” she said while talking to the media at a conference titled ‘5G and Beyond: Shaping the Future of Connectivity’.\n\nThe minister was asked about the reasons for continuous losses faced by the state-owned Ufone while other telecoms, including Zong and Jazz, witnessed a significant jump in profits in 2024.\n\nMs Khawaja added that since the operations of PTCL and Ufone were with Etisalat, the IT ministry was not responsible for its financial health. However, she said that the Government of Pakistan owned PTCL and Ufone was a subsidiary of PTCL, but she added that Ufone’s balance sheet was not provided to the government.\n\nThe minister said the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) should provide the answer to Ufone’s weak financial standing. Incidentally, the minister also declined to respond to the query that there was no member of the IT ministry on the Ufone board and referred the question to the secretary of IT, who confused the Ufone board with the PTCL board.\n\n5G auction\n\nThe PTA organised the conference in collaboration with the telecom regulator of Malaysia and Nokia Pakistan.\n\nAddressing the conference, Ms Khawaja presented the argument against auctioning the 5G spectrum, saying that it increases telecom companies’ business costs.\n\nThis perspective aligns with the view that high spectrum costs can be passed on to consumers, potentially slowing down the adoption of 5G technology and hindering the implementation of relevant infrastructure development due to financial constraints.\n\nShe stressed that Pakistan could learn from the experiences of other countries that have already launched 5G so that the same mistakes are not repeated.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 18th, 2025",
