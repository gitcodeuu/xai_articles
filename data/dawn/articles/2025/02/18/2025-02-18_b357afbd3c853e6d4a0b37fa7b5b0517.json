  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Over the escape of a few suspects from police custody recently, the high-up of the police took notice and asked the officials concerned to put their house in order.\n\nIn a written directive titled ‘Instruction regarding transfer of suspects to lockups and jail’ issued from the office of the deputy inspector general of police to the senior superintendent of police and other officers, it was stated that several verbal instructions had been issued regarding lockups of the police station to prevent the escape of suspects.\n\nIt said that in case of negligence or non-compliance with these instructions, strict departmental and legal action would be taken against the responsible officer and official.\n\n“But due to the lack of attention and negligence, incidents of suspects’ escape from police custody are happening every day,” it said, adding that the main reason behind such incidents was the irresponsibility of officers and officials in their duties.\n\nDIG sends letter to subordinates, tells them to enforce SOPs to prevent escape of suspects\n\nThe officials concerned were asked to ensure the implementation of the instructions given in the Police Rules and ensure the enforcement of SOPs (Standard Operating Procedure) and instructions issued by the senior officers to avoid such incidents.\n\nAll station house officers and station clerks (moharrars) should plug the loopholes and repair defects in their lockups, it said, adding that CCTVs installed in the lockups, which are not connected to the Safe City Authority, should be connected to the authority immediately.\n\nBesides other repairs, the directive also ordered adequate lighting and arrangement of beds for the suspects. It said that separate armed guards should also be posted and lockups should be checked on a daily basis by the station clerk, adding that meals should be provided to the suspect from the official mess.\n\nIt said the instructions given in the Police Rules and SOPs issued by the senior officers should be followed in letter and spirit during the movement of suspects, for instance from the lockup to court or for recoveries.\n\nThe transportation and shifting of suspects will be the duty of the upper sub-ordinate and investigation officer concerned. The suspect should be properly handcuffed and during the transportation of the suspect from the lockups to the court or jail, the police officials escorting them should be armed with weapons as per the SOPs. The station clerk is made responsible for the deployment of a sufficient number of officials keeping in view the number of suspects. The senior police officers should be informed before the transfer and shifting of suspects arrested in connection with sensitive and heinous cases, it added.\n\nAll the superintendents of police and sub-divisional police officers should examine the lockups of the police stations of their zones and circles, respectively, and ensure implementation of the Police Rules and the instructions issued in the letter.\n\nThe directive came after multiple incidents of suspects’ escape were highlighted in media reports. On Feb 12, a suspect arrested by police in connection with a murder in the area of Nilore police station escaped after breaking the locks.\n\nThe suspect was in police custody on physical remand and detained at the Banigala police station instead of Nilore station, in whose limits he allegedly committed the murder and chopped the victim into pieces. After his escape, six police officials, including the SHO, were booked.\n\nOn Feb 16, a handcuffed suspect arrested in connection with drug peddling escaped from custody while being transported to jail. The Khanna police were transporting him to the Adiala jail on judicial remand. While en route to Adiala, they stopped in front of the Koral police station at a photocopy shop, during which the accused slipped his hand out of the handcuffs and escaped.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 18th, 2025",
