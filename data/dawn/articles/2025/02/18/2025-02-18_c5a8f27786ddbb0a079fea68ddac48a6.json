The resolution was presented by PPP’s Shazia Singhar.\n\nQuestion Hour\n\nFurnishing statement and replies of the lawmakers’ written and verbal queries during the Question Hour, Excise and Narcotics Minister Mukesh Kumar Chawla said that the provincial government was taking serious and effective measures to make the society drug-free.\n\nThe assembly members expressed concern over the increasing use and sale of drugs across the province.\n\nMQM-P’s Rashid Khan said that liquor was being sold to Muslims from registered wine shops. The deputy speaker interrupted him by saying that irrelevant questions should not be asked.\n\nThe provincial minister said that other government departments were also working very actively against drugs. He also emphasised the need to create awareness among masses about the drug menace.\n\nLater, the assembly session was prorogued on the order of the governor.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 18th, 2025",
