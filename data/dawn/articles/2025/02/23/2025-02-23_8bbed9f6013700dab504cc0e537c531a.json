It did not elaborate on when this took place.\n\n“The rate for selling the kidneys of both the individuals was fixed at Rs280,000,” the department said. “The gang takes advantage of struggling people, removes their organs and is involved in the business of trafficking them.”\n\nThe excise department added that the suspect’s mobile phone contained video footage of the victims. It said the suspect was handed over to the Federal Investigation Agency.\n\nIn October 2023, then-Punjab caretaker chief minister Mohsin Naqvi claimed that the police apprehended gang members who were allegedly involved in conducting over 300 unlawful kidney operations.\n\nNaqvi, currently serving as the federal interior minister, told a press conference that the gang’s suspected leader and his accomplices had been arrested and the police team that did the job would be awarded a cash prize of Rs500,000.\n\nHe alleged that the main accused unlawfully extracted the kidneys of 328 people and transplanted them to rich clients, adding that the suspect was arrested at least five times in the past and confessed to performing the operations.",
