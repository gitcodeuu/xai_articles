Earlier in December, Trans­world Associates linked the Africa-2 cable to its landing station in Karachi. It is also expected to come online by next year.\n\nCurrently, six cables, with a capacity of 13tpbs, bring internet to Pakistan: Asia-Africa-Europe 1 (AAE-1), South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 4 (SMW4) and India-Middle East-Western Europe (IMEWE), managed by PTCL; and South East Asia-Middle East-West Europe 5 (SMW-5) and Transworld Associates 1 (TWA-1), operated by Transworld Associates.\n\nCyber Internet Services operates the sixth cable named Pak­istan and East Africa Connecting Europe (PEACE).\n\nWith input from APP\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 23rd, 2025",
