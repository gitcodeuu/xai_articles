  "content": "KARACHI: A judicial magistrate on Saturday remanded Mohajir Qaumi Movement-Haqiqi (MQM-H) chairman Afaq Ahmed in judicial custody in a third arson case registered against him.\n\nOn Saturday, jail authorities brought the MQM-H chairman before Judicial Magistrate (West) Nasir Ahmed Chandio.\n\nRepresenting Mr Ahmed, lawyers Hashmat Khaild and Javed Chhatari argued that their client had been implicated in the present case on political grounds.\n\nThey asked the magistrate to discharge him under Section 63 of the criminal procedure code.\n\nHowever, the magistrate noted in his order that when the court asked the lawyers to submit a written application they requested to send the suspect to prison on judicial remand.\n\nThe court observed that Section 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc.) of the Pakistan Penal Code was a non-bailable offence, which required a trial by a sessions court.\n\nObserving that there was no need for further interrogations as police record indicated that no recovery was required from the MQM-H chief, the magistrate sent Mr Ahmed to prison.\n\nPolice had arrested the MQM-H chief on Feb 12 from his Defence residence and booked him in two cases registered at the Landhi and Awami Colony police stations for allegedly instigating people to torch heavy vehicles operating in the metropolis in violation of a ban on their movement during the daytime.\n\nOn Friday, an anti-terrorism court had granted him bail in both cases. However, he was not set free from prison as police have shown him arrested in a third case lodged at the Surjani Town police station about setting a tanker ablaze.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 23rd, 2025",
