  "content": "ISLAMABAD: After two days of protests, the All Government Employees Grand Alliance (AGEGA) called off its sit-in following successful negotiations with the government committee led by Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs Rana Sanaullah Khan.\n\nThe committee assured protesters that their demands would be reviewed and addressed in the upcoming federal budget.\n\nA major win for teachers came with the assurance of restoration of the 25pc tax rebate for teachers, a key demand of the Federal Government College Teachers Association (FGCTA).\n\nAddressing the protesters late on Friday night, Rana Sanaullah acknowledged the employees’ demands, stating: “These demands are justified. Employees need to survive, support their families, and pay for their children’s education. However, the government is also facing financial constraints.”\n\nFGCTA president Professor Mohammad Akram welcomed the decision, calling it ‘a positive step forward’. He added: “We appreciate the government’s move to restore the tax rebate for teachers, however this rebate should be 100pc.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 23rd, 2025",
