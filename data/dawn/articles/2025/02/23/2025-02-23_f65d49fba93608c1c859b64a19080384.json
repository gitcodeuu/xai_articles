It’s a rare treat to sore eyes.”\n\nHe deplored the alarming decline of wildlife in the area due to unchecked hunting practices.\n\nHe said a local hunter claimed to have killed around 130 foxes, three striped hyenas, and six wolves in the Koh-i-Sulaiman region, adding that such accounts highlight the severe threat posed by hunting communities to the region’s biodiversity.\n\nConservationists consider the striped hyena a keystone species crucial for maintaining ecological balance. They have serious concerns over the lack of awareness about wildlife protection and enforcement of relevant laws in the region.\n\n“The sighting of the striped hyena is a reminder of the rich biodiversity we stand to lose if immediate action is not taken,” says Jamal Leghari. “The hunting culture, and a lack of education and enforcement, is pushing our wildlife to the brink of extinction.”\n\nHe says the situation calls for urgent intervention from authorities, conservation organisations, and local communities. Efforts must be made to educate hunters about the importance of wildlife conservation and the long-term ecological benefits of preserving endangered species, he adds.\n\nMr Leghari stressed the need for strengthening enforcement of anti-poaching laws and establishing protected areas in the Koh-i-Sulaiman range, saying these steps are critical to safeguarding the region’s remaining wildlife.\n\nHe says the rare sighting of striped hyena in the region serves as both a warning and an opportunity. It underscores the urgent need for collective action to protect Pakistan’s natural heritage before it is lost forever, he adds.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 23rd, 2025",
