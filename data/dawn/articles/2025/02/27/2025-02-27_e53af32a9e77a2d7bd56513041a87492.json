It’s retraumatising for them. It’s gaslighting of a sort,” he added.\n\nAndrew Tate moved to Romania years ago after first starting a webcam business in the UK. He leapt to fame in 2016 when he first appeared on the UK’s ‘Big Brother’ reality television show but was removed after a video emerged showing him attacking a woman.\n\nHe then turned to social media platforms to promote his often misogynistic and divisive views on how to be successful.\n\nBanned from Instagram and TikTok for his views, Tate is followed by more than 10 million people on X watching his homophobic and racist posts.\n\nA Romanian court has granted a British request to extradite the Tates to Britain, but only after legal proceedings in Romania have concluded. Last year, the Tates were sentenced in a tax fraud case in Britain.",
