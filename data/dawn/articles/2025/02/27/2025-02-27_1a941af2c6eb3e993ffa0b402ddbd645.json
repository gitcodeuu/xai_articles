  "content": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump said Wednesday that tariffs on EU products would be 25 percent in general, and signaled that duties on Canada and Me­­xico will take effect in ea­­r­ly April.\n\nSpeaking at a cab­inet meeting, Trump des­c­r­ibed the EU — whose cr­­eation was encouraged for decades by Washington — as rooted in an attempt to counter the United States.\n\n“Look, let’s be honest, the European Union was formed in order to screw the US,” Trump said.\n\nAsked if he had made a decision on tariff levels for the bloc, Trump added: “We’ll be announcing it very soon and it’ll be 25pc, generally speaking.” He said this would hit products including cars, ad­­­ding that the EU has “really taken advantage of us.”\n\nTrump has threatened “reciprocal tariffs” on US trading partners to counter “unfair and unbalan­ced” trade. He has also said he would impose sweeping levies on imports of certain products, such as autos and pharmaceuticals.\n\nSince taking office in Jan­uary, Trump has ann­ounced and paused blanket tariffs on US neighbors Canada and Mexico over illegal immigration and fentanyl smuggling.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 27th, 2025",
