It was agreed that senior officials from Wapda and the GB committee would work together to resolve issues related to land acquisition and resettlement for the dam-affected people.\n\nThe federal committee decided to continue efforts to resolve the matter amicably. Sources said the committee members eventually agreed to accept the protesters’ demands.\n\nAs per the protesters’ demands, the committee members will visit Chilas, meet a representative body of the protesters and announce a strategy to address their concerns.\n\nAccording to the sources, the 31-point charter of demands could not be resolved at once, as some points require approval from relevant departments. However, some demands, including development schemes and jobs, fall within the authority of the committee members and will be announced in Chilas.\n\nFor the remaining points, representatives of the protesters and the federal committee will establish a timeline to address them through mutual understanding and consensus.\n\nDespite the rain, protesters continued their sit-in in Chilas for the 11th consecutive day on Wednesday. The head of the protest movement, Hazratullah, said negotiations with the federal committee members were ongoing. He congratulated the protesters on their struggle, which had finally yielded results.\n\nHe announced that the federal committee members would arrive in Chilas once the weather improves and flights resume from Islamabad. He claimed that the committee members would announce the acceptance of the protesters’ demands.\n\nHazratullah said that until the federal committee’s arrival, the sit-in would continue.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 27th, 2025",
