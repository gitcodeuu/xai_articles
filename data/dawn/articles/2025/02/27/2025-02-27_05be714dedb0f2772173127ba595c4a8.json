Up to six inches of snow fell in Ast­ore, Skardu and Ghanche districts.\n\nAccording to Frontier Works Organisation (FWO), the Karakoram Highway has been blocked at multiple locations in Dassu area of Kohistan and work to clear the road is under way.\n\nThousands passengers travelling to and from Gilgit-Baltistan to other parts of areas were stranded as hundreds vehicles stranded on both sides of the highway.\n\nThe Gilgit-Diamer section of the Karakoram Highway has been opened for traffic while the snowfall has made the highway treacherous in the Gojal area near Khunjerab Pass.\n\nThe FWO personnel used heavy machinery to remove snow from the highway and cleared it for traffic at some points. The Baltistan Road, blocked by heavy boulders, has been opened for traffic.\n\nThe Pakistan Mete­oro­logical Department (PMD) has forecasted heavy win­ds, thunderstorms and in­­termittent snowfalls acr­oss Gilgit-Baltistan from February 25 to March 2.\n\nSnow normally falls in the months of December and January in GB, but this year the area has received snowfall in the end of February.\n\nAgriculture production of the area depends on me­­lting of snow on glaci­ers which normally get pl­­enty of snow in the months of December and January.\n\nThe local administration has cautioned travelers and tourists visiting GB areas to avoid travelling to mountain areas unnecessary as there is possibility of landslides and avalanches.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 27th, 2025",
