However, conservation efforts have not yielded the desired results due to continued retaliatory killings, climate change, and the wolves’ own predatory behavior,” Baloch explained.\n\n“Conservation efforts have produced satisfactory results in protected areas, but they have been largely ineffective in other regions due to ongoing human-wildlife conflict,” he added. One of the primary reasons behind this conflict, he noted, is the way wolves hunt livestock.\n\n“They attack in packs and kill multiple animals at a time, unlike other carnivores that target only a single or a couple of animals for food. This makes them the number one enemy of farmers and shepherds,” Baloch said.\n\nLivestock is a primary source of livelihood in rural Pakistan, particularly in Balochistan, where retaliatory killings of wolves are common.\n\n“The vast patrolling areas of wolves also make it difficult to protect them from human encounters and other dangers,” he added.\n\nKabir emphasised the critical role of wolves in regulating prey populations and maintaining ecosystem balance.\n\n“Wolves are among the least studied carnivores in Pakistan and have been largely ignored in research and conservation programmes. As top predators in their habitats, they regulate the population of other prey species,” he said.\n\n“Their absence would lead to an unchecked increase in prey populations, causing overgrazing, habitat degradation, resource competition and ultimately the collapse of prey populations,” he warned.\n\nA decline in wolf populations, he added, could also lead to an increase in smaller predators, further disrupting the ecological balance.\n\n“As predators, wolves help control the spread of disease by targeting sick, old and weak prey animals. Without them, disease could spread more rapidly among prey populations,” he noted.",
