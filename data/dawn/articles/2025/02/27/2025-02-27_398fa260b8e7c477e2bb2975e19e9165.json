  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Public Accounts Committee met on Wednesday to address significant audit objections related to various government departments, including the non-transparent process of auctioning commercial plots by the Capital Development Authority worth Rs37.822 billion.\n\nTerming it controversial, a major audit objection was raised regarding the Capital Development Authority’s non-transparent auction process for commercial plots. While approval was granted for the auction of 29 plots, only 23 were auctioned.\n\nThe committee also discovered that the CDA had failed to prepare financial statements, prompting severe criticism. The audit maintained that acceptance of auction bids without detailed calculations of previous sale prices, calculation of general price index (GPI), and analysis of market trend resulted in a non-transparent process for the auction of commercial plots worth Rs37,822.260 million.\n\nIt held that the irregularity occurred due to weak internal and financial controls, adding an irregularity was pointed out in March 2023 but the authority did not respond. As a result, the committee granted the authority six months to finalise its financial statements.\n\nFIA asked to look into irregularities in construction of Bhara Kahu bypass; audit of Gun and Country Club ordered\n\nPakistan Sports Board\n\nConvened under the chairmanship of Junaid Akbar Khan, the apex parliamentary committee reviewed audit objections concerning the Inter-Provincial Coordination Ministry. The audit report revealed that the Pakistan Sports Board had unlawfully granted Rs138 million in advance to M/s Sports in Pakistan. The committee instructed the authorities to recover the amount within 15 days and take appropriate action against those responsible.\n\nSimilarly, PAC also examined an objection regarding the Gun and Country Club’s failure to deposit Rs480 million into the Sports Endowment Fund account. PAC member Syed Hussain Tariq raised concerns over the club’s reluctance to undergo a proper audit. The committee subsequently ordered a full audit of the club’s financial activities over the past five years and demanded a report within a month.\n\nAdditionally, the committee reviewed another objection regarding unlicensed arms and ammunition held by the club. Questions were raised about how these weapons were acquired without proper licensing. The committee sought a detailed report on the matter.\n\nThe committee also expressed frustration over the interior ministry’s failure to utilise grants exceeding Rs3 billion. The members criticised the ministry’s inefficiency and summoned the finance secretary for an immediate explanation during the session.\n\nHowever, the finance secretary remained absent from the meeting due to an ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting. The chairman demanded that the IMF meeting’s minutes be shared with the committee, warning of severe consequences if any misleading statements were made regarding the IMF’s involvement.\n\nPAC Chairman Junaid Akbar Khan also issued a stern warning against inappropriate behaviour during committee meetings. He emphasised that no misconduct or political manoeuvring would be tolerated, stating that while past transgressions would be forgiven, future violations would be met with strict disciplinary action.\n\nThe PAC scrutinised irregularities in the direct contracting process for the Bhara Kahu Bypass construction, which reportedly resulted in higher-than-market costs. Concerns were also raised about accidents at the site that led to casualties.\n\nThe committee referred the matter to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and requested a report within a month. Another discussion focused on the low-cost housing scheme in Farash Town, which was supposed to provide affordable housing. The committee learned that while 60 per cent of physical work was completed, 58 per cent of the payments had been made. The PAC stressed the importance of ensuring that public funds were utilised efficiently. The committee also reviewed an audit objection concerning over-priced uniform procurement for the Frontier Corps (South KP). Instructions were given to recover the excess amount paid.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 27th, 2025",
