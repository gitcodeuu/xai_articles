These are evident facts in Pakistan today,” he said.\n\n“Today, there is no permission to even talk. Laws are being made to stop people from talking and to dismantle the judicial system,” he said, apparently referring to the recently promulgated Prevention of Electronic Crimes (Amendment) Act 2025, also known as Peca.\n\nAfter talks between the government and the opposition collapsed in January, the PTI made another push to establish a joint front against the federal government and roped in Mr Abbasi to become part of its anti-government movement.\n\nReferring to the ruling coalition, Mr Abbasi said that those who championed democracy in the past were now more invested in political power, calling out the authorities for making it difficult to arrange the moot.\n\n“Now, their government is not even allowing a conference related to the Constitution to be held behind closed doors in the nation’s capital,” he said, adding that three venues of the conference had to be changed as the authorities did not allow holding the conference there.\n\n“We are thankful to lawyers for providing this space today. We tried other places as well, including the institutions, but today, the government is so scared that even a conference on the Constitution is not possible,” Mr Abbasi said.\n\n‘Illegitimate assembly’\n\nTTAP chief Mahmood Khan Achakzai vowed to hold the government accountable, calling the current assembly illegitimate. He lamented that the benefits of independence had not reached the public even after 70 years, rendering the general public powerless in decision-making.\n\nMr Achakzai shared that he had been imprisoned multiple times for supporting democratic principles but continued to stand by his country. He criticised the Feb 8 general elections held last year as rigged and stressed that upholding the Constitution was crucial for the country’s stability.\n\nPakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ) President Afzal Butt accused political parties of advocating for press freedom while in opposition but suppressing the media once in power. He urged opposition parties to pledge not to repeat this pattern.\n\nJournalist Asma Shirazi pointed out that certain figures within the opposition were also responsible for spreading fake news.\n\nPTI Secretary General Salman Akram Raja, Sunni Ittehad Council head Sahibzada Hamid Raza, Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen chief Nasir Shirazi and other political leaders also attended the conference.\n\nPermission for conference\n\nLast week, the opposition alliance announced plans for a two-day national conference “to discuss the current political situation and national issues”. The announcement was made by Mr Abbasi and Mr Achakzai at a joint press conference.\n\nHowever, on Wednesday, opposition leaders accused the government of pressuring Legend Hotel to cancel the second day of the conference, but they vowed to proceed with the event.\n\nAddressing a presser after the conference alongside other opposition leaders, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi claimed that the event’s agenda focused solely on the Constitution and the rule of law, with no discussion of anti-state activities or incitement.\n\nHe said that opposition members informed the hotel management that they had booked the venue for two days and demanded written clarification if the conference was cancelled under pressure.\n\nHitting out at a PML-N supplement published in Wednesday’s newspapers, he said its reality was that the government spending “billions on advertisements is today fearful of a single conference”.\n\nSpeaking after Mr Abbasi, Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly Omar Ayub Khan praised the content of Wednesday’s discussions on the conference’s first day.\n\nHe said everyone talked about strengthening the country, adding that everyone gathered was of a democratic mindset. “We are talking to strengthen the country, and here, the hotel administration came to us and expressed their desperation that they are under pressure. Questioned about whose pressure, they said: ‘You must know since you are wise people.’”\n\nOffshore assets\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to a report by the Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen), PTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqas Akram questioned the prospects of foreign investment in Pakistan, given that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif allegedly held more assets abroad than in Pakistan.\n\nHe argued that this sent a negative message to the international community about the safety and viability of investments in Pakistan. Akram accused the ruling elite of seizing power without public mandate and alleged they would flee the country at the first sign of losing power.\n\nMr Akram said the successive governments led by the Sharif and Zardari dynasties had drained Pakistan’s economy through unchecked corruption, money laundering and cronyism, stressing that Pakistan stood at the brink of financial collapse.\n\nHe demanded immediate accountability for these crimes against the people of Pakistan and urged authorities concerned to investigate foreign assets and wealth of Pakistan’s ruling elite, particularly the Sharif and Zardari families, seeking the repatriation of “stolen money” to the national treasury.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 27th, 2025",
