  "content": "MUZAFFARABAD: A station house officer (SHO) in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) was suspended from service and booked in a criminal case for allegedly harassing a British-Kashmiri woman in Mirpur.\n\nThe woman had been advised by the divisional commissioner of Mirpur to approach Thothal police station for redress in a property possession case.\n\nHowever, when she contacted SHO Chaudhry Imran Ahmed, he told her that he would pick her up from her residence himself.\n\nDuring the ride in the SHO’s vehicle, the woman repeatedly faced and resisted attempts by the SHO to exploit the situation for personal gratification.\n\nSources said that in an audio clip secretly recorded by the victim on her mobile phone, the allegedly intoxicated SHO was heard pressuring her to move to the front seat, remove her abaya, befriend him, and visit his home, while repeatedly making other obscene demands.\n\nThe recording, also obtained by Dawn, was reportedly brought to the attention of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Rana Abdul Jabbar on February 21.\n\nTaking serious notice, the IGP immediately summoned the SHO to headquarters and directed SSP Mirpur Khawar Shaukat Ali to conduct a preliminary inquiry.\n\nA police department spokesperson said in a statement on Tuesday that the inquiry had confirmed the harassment allegations, leading to the registration of a criminal case against the SHO.\n\nHe was also suspended from service pending further orders, with separate departmental proceedings initiated against him.\n\n“Strict disciplinary action will be taken against the inspector based on the findings of the departmental inquiry,” the spokesperson said. He reiterated the police department’s zero-tolerance policy on harassment, particularly cases involving women, making it clear that any person involved in illegal activities or crimes, even if affiliated with the police department or holding any position, would face legal action without discrimination.\n\nComplaints of harassment against women would not be tolerated, and strict disciplinary and criminal action would be taken against such police personnel or officers, he said, adding that ensuring the protection of women would remain an absolute priority.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 27th, 2025",
