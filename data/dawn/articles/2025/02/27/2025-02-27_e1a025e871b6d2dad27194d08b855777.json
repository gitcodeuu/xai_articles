I have said this in previous conferences as well — that we came here to play good cricket.\n\n“We will try to play a positive game. Just like we defeated England today, we hope to beat Australia as well.\n\n“We won’t put that pressure on ourselves by thinking too much about the semi-final qualification.”\n\nRain is forecast in Lahore but even a washout will keep Afghanistan in contention of reaching the semi-finals, but they will then have to depend on other results or net run-rate.\n\nAfghanistan, a growing force in white-ball cricket, and Australia have played four ODIs previously with the Australians winning all of them.\n\nAt the 2023 World Cup, Afghanistan had Australia on the ropes at 91-7 when a cramping Glenn Maxwell hammered an unbeaten 201 to pull off victory in hot and humid Mumbai.\n\nAfghanistan roared back to beat Australia at last year’s T20 World Cup and they reached the semi-finals in a landmark achievement.\n\nAsked about the threat that the big-hitting all-rounder Maxwell poses, Shahidi said: “I know that he played really well in the 2023 World Cup, but that’s part of history.”\n\nAfghanistan suffered a 107-run hammering to South Africa in their Champions Trophy opener last week but bounced back to post 325-7 against England.\n\nIbrahim Zadran smashed 177, the highest individual innings in Champions Trophy history, after Afghanistan chose to bat and were struggling on a precarious 37-3.\n\nIn reply, England were all out for 317 to suffer their second straight defeat.\n\nThe 23-year-old Zadran, who scored 17 against South Africa, is back in action after a long lay-off following ankle surgery.\n\n“Even though he was away from cricket for six months, it’s never easy for a player to return from injury and make such a strong comeback in a high-stakes match,” said Shahidi.\n\n“I am extremely happy for him because he is a very talented and hard-working player.”\n\nAfghanistan’s performances at the 50-overs and Twenty20 World Cups mean there is no chance of Australia taking them lightly in Friday’s Champions Trophy match, particularly with a place in the semi-finals on the line, coach Jonathan Trott said.\n\n“It’s all on the line, and since I’ve been coach we’ve played against Australia three times and we’ve been in the game in each of those games,” former England batter Trott told reporters.\n\n“We should take a lot of confidence from that … certainly what happened in the World Cup, T20 World Cup, and I say this to the players as well, that Afghanistan’s never going to be taken lightly ever again.\n\n“We’ve got to be prepared because I know Australia aren’t going to take us lightly. In the past, perhaps people would have seen the fixture and thought it was a little bit easier than playing a historic test nation.\n\n“In this format, in these conditions, I don’t see that. Every game that we play is going to be competitive and every game we go into I expect to win.”\n\nTrott said there was a rawness to the team when he took over in 2022 but they have grown with experience.\n\n“I’m quite an ambitious type of guy and I’m ambitious with these talented players,” he added.\n\n“Who knows what we can achieve.”",
