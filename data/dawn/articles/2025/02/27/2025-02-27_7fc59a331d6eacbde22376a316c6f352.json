Exemptions, however, were granted to trucks carrying water, petroleum products, medicines, meat and other essential goods. The Sindh government has also made it mandatory for all heavy vehicles in Karachi to have a physical fitness certificate amid the rising number of traffic accidents involving dumper trucks.\n\nRegarding today’s accident, Malir Superintendent of Police Saeed Rind told Dawn.com: “The victims were riding the motorcycle when the heavy vehicle hit them near Daud Chali. The errant driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind the trailer that was seized by the police.”\n\nHe added that the injured were taken to Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre (JPMC) where 25-year-old Shahbaz was pronounced dead while his cousin, Ali Haider, was admitted for treatment.\n\n“The deceased originally hailed from Tando Mohammed Khan where his coffin was taken for burial. The relatives told the police that they would lodge a case after the burial,” the police official added.\n\nSeparately, an unidentified man was killed in a hit-and-run incident on main University Road near old Sabzi Mandi earlier today, according to a statement from the Edhi Foundation spokesperson. It added that the body was taken to JPMC for legal formalities.\n\nEarlier in the week, in yet another accident involving heavy traffic violating a ban on their movement during the daytime, an industrialist and his son were killed when a trailer struck their car, which fell from the ICI Bridge to the ground on Monday afternoon.\n\nLast week, two motorcyclists were killed and another was critically injured in accidents involving heavy vehicles at Karachi’s Sharea Faisal and National Highway.\n\nAn alarming increase was registered in road accidents in Karachi as nearly 500 people were killed while 4,879 were injured in 2024 due to a host of reasons ranging from reckless driving to construction activities, etc, according to hospital data.",
