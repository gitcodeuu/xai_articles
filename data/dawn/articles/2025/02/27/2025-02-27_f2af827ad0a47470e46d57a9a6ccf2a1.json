  "content": "QUETTA: Various community development proj­ects, including in the hea­lth and education sectors, were discussed during a meeting between a leading businessman and the representatives of Reko Diq Mining Com­p­any (RDMC) on Wednesday.\n\nFarooq Khilji, a former president of Quetta Cha­m­ber of Commerce and Ind­u­stry (QCCI), and Ashley Price and Mr Ahmer of RDMC explored the possibility of collaboration between the two sides to implement these projects.\n\nThe RDMC and QCCI agreed to further collaborate, with future interactions planned in Quetta, Karachi, and Islamabad.\n\nEx-QCCI chief, firm officials agree to deepen collaboration\n\nThe meeting highligh­ted the importance of the chamber’s role in fostering\n\nbusiness growth with Mr Khilji extending full support for community development initiatives including health, education, skill development and scholarship for the youth from Chagai.\n\nHe said the fact that over Rs6 billion worth of supplies and services were being provided to a world-class company spoke volumes about the potential of Balochistan’s suppliers to meet high standards.\n\nHe said it was heartening to note that the RDMC had awarded contracts valued at Rs6.1bn to suppliers across Balochistan over the past two years. Of this, he noted, Rs2bn worth of business was specifically given to suppliers from the Chagai district.\n\n“Given the scale of business being awarded to local companies, we can be confident that with proper guidance and handholding, Balochistan businesses are capable of meeting the world-class standards expected by a company like RDMC,” he said. “This partnership between RDMC and local suppliers is an encouraging sign for the region’s economic growth.”\n\nMr Khilji proposed a collaboration between the RDMC and the QCCI to strengthen the capacity of local suppliers and vendors.\n\nMr Farooq also proposed a memorandum of understanding between the QCCI and RDMC and offered to organise a visit for the company’s delegation to Quetta or an interaction with the business community.\n\nThe RDMC expressed interest in advancing collaborations with the business community through its head of the supply chain management.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 27th, 2025",
