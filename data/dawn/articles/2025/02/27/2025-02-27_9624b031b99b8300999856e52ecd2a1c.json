He didn’t fully follow through, freezing their recruitment while allowing serving personnel to remain.\n\n“The scope and severity of this ban is unprecedented. It is a complete purge of all transgender individuals from military service,” said Shannon Minter of the National Centre For Lesbian Rights (NCLR).\n\nThe memo was filed in court as part of a lawsuit brought by NCLR and GLAD Law. The suit challenges the constitutionality of the January executive order and argues that it violates the equal protection component of the Fifth Amendment.\n\nThis month, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had said people with gender dysphoria already in the military would be “treated with dignity and respect.”\n\nThe military has about 1.3 million active-duty personnel, according to Department of Defence data. Although transgender rights advocates say there are as many as 15,000 transgender service members, officials say the number is in the low thousands.\n\nA poll from Gallup published this month said 58 per cent of Americans favoured allowing openly transgender individuals serving in the military, but the support had declined from 71pc in 2019.",
