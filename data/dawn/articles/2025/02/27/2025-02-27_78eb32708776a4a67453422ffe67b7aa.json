Trump says he wants to end the bloodshed with an early ceasefire.\n\nThis week, Putin tempered expectations of a quick deal, saying that trust between Russia and the United States had to be rebuilt before anything could be achieved.\n\nBut in televised comments to members of the FSB security service today, he said: “I note that the first contacts with the new American administration inspire certain hopes.\n\n“There is a reciprocal mood to work to restore intergovernmental ties and to gradually resolve the huge number of systemic and strategic problems that have built up in the world’s security architecture.”\n\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the Istanbul talks were expected to be the first in a series of contacts aimed at building confidence and removing “irritants” in bilateral relations.\n\nIn an example of judicial cooperation, the office of Russia’s prosecutor general said Dmitry Koshelev, wanted by Moscow on suspicion of stealing $1.5 million from a courier at gunpoint in 2014, was being deported from the United States today.\n\nThe Russian team arrived in a black Mercedes van for the meeting at the gated residence of the US consul general in Istanbul.\n\n“No one expects solutions to come easily and quickly. The problem at hand is too complex and neglected,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters today.\n\n“But with the two countries’ political will, with a willingness to hear and listen to each other, I think we will be able to get through this working process.”\n\nRussia and the United States have expelled diplomats and limited the appointment of new staff at each other’s missions in tit-for-tat measures over the past decade, leaving their embassies thinly staffed.\n\nThe US State Department said today’s talks would cover issues such as staffing levels, visas and diplomatic banking.\n\n“To be clear, there are no political or security issues on the agenda. Ukraine is not on the agenda,” a state department spokesperson said before the meeting.\n\n“The constructiveness of these talks will become apparent very quickly; either issues will get resolved or they won’t. We will know soon if Russia is really willing to engage in good faith.”\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the outcome of the meeting “will show how quickly and effectively we can move”.\n\nHe acknowledged that Russia had “created uncomfortable conditions” for US diplomats in Moscow, in what he said was retaliation for Washington’s treatment of Russian diplomats.\n\nDespite their narrow focus, the talks could eventually lead to progress over the whole Russia-US relationship in areas such as nuclear disarmament and economic cooperation.\n\nBoth sides see potential for lucrative business ventures. Putin said this week that Moscow would be ready to invite the US to enter joint projects to mine rare earth deposits in Russia and the parts of Ukraine that it has claimed as its own.\n\nPeskov said there could be joint development of natural resources in the Arctic, though there were no substantive talks on this yet.\n\nThe US delegation in Istanbul was led by Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Sonata Coulter and the Russian team by Alexander Darchiyev, head of the foreign ministry’s North America department.\n\nDarchiyev is seen as the front-runner to be Russia’s next ambassador to the US, a post that is currently vacant.",
