The initiative requires Rs300 million to be obtained outside the budget.\n\n“Distribution will occur via a transparent open balloting process in the presence of media, subject to the following qualification criteria: The applicant must be a permanent resident of Sindh; the applicant must be a student or a working female; the applicant must hold a valid two-wheeler driving license; the applicant cannot sell the electric motorcycle for a period of seven years,” according to the statement.\n\nThe cabinet noted that an increasing number of women worldwide were opting for electric motorcycles as their primary mode of transport for daily commuting.\n\n“Key factors driving this demand include greater mobility, cost-effectiveness compared to cars or public transport, eco-friendliness, and minimal maintenance,” it said.\n\nThe cabinet also decided that the Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) would procure the EV motorcycles through competitive bidding from one or more manufacturers, contingent on price and maintenance factors, the statement added.\n\nSeparately, the cabinet was informed that the Sindh Mass Transit Authority (SMTA) planned to procure 50 public transport buses for Karachi, including 15 double-decker buses and 35 electric buses.\n\nThe transport department intends to operate 15 double-decker buses on Shahrea Faisal and approved the proposal, allocating Rs3 billion for the project.\n\nCM Shah, per the statement, also allowed the Dow University of Health Sciences (DUHS) to establish a company to manufacture anti-snake and anti-rabies vaccines.\n\nThe meeting was attended by provincial ministers, advisors, special assistants, the chief secretary, and relevant secretaries.\n\nEarlier this month, Balochistan CM Sarfraz Bugti also announced the launch of the Pink Scooty and Electric Bikes Scheme to provide modern travel facilities to students, youth, and working women in his province.\n\nThe provincial government, in collaboration with the federation, has also launched the “Greater Karachi Bulk Supply Scheme K-IV” to increase the water supply by 1,200 cusecs, totaling 2,400 cusecs for the K-IV scheme.\n\nOn July 19, 2023, the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC) approved a PC-1 titled “Water Requirement for the K-IV Project,” with a budget of Rs39,942.559m , equally split between the Federal and Sindh Governments.\n\nSince then, construction materials and labor costs have risen significantly.\n\nDuring 2023-24, the Irrigation Department sought interim relief for eight items related to ongoing contracts since no new schemes were awarded, apart from the Kalri Baghar Feeder Upper Lining Project.\n\nAlthough the Sindh Cabinet approved the Composite Schedule of Rates (CSR) 2024 on June 1, 2024, this approval has no retrospective impact on the project.\n\nAt the second Project Steering Committee meeting on November 7, 2024, the committee acknowledged the necessity of timely completion, agreeing on interim relief for the eight items and suggesting a revised PC-1 for approval.\n\nThe revised PC-1 was prepared and discussed at the 30th Project Development Working Party (PDWP) meeting on December 16, 2024. Options for consideration include granting interim relief and revising the PC-1 with a new projected cost of Rs50,989.328m, reflecting a 27.65 per cent increase over the original budget.\n\nThe cabinet approved the proposal.\n\nAccording to the statement, the cabinet was also informed of the need to construct a transmission line for the K-IV project by the Sindh Transmission and Dispatch Company (STDC).\n\nAdditionally, a 132 kV grid station is required, necessitating funding of Rs 16.47bn for its establishment.\n\nThe energy department has agreed that the loan amount will be disbursed in tranches based on the actual progress of the project, which will be verified by the department.\n\nThe cabinet approved a 20pc joint equity investment totaling Rs3,295m by STDC and the Sindh Energy Holding Company Limited (SEHCL).\n\nThe remaining 80pc, amounting to Rs13,179m, will be financed through debt or loans from the Sindh Finance Department.\n\nThe repayment of the loan by STDC will begin from the Commercial Operations Date (COD).\n\nThe Karachi Water and Sewerage Corporation (KWSC) will act as the 50 MW bulk-power consumer for the Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (HESCO).\n\nA Transmission Service Agreement (TSA) will be signed between KWSC and STDC, and a 50 MW Renewable Energy Hybrid Independent Power Plant (IPP) will subsequently be established in the vicinity.",
