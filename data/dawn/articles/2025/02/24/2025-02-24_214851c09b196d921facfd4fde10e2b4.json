He said he took the decision to avoid collateral damage, considering the precarious situation as many people were returning from the congregation. He later reached home unharmed.\n\nOfficials denied the reported killing of a tribal elder, Fareed Raisani, during the road closure, explaining that he was safe and sound at his home in Quetta.\n\nSoon after receiving information about the situation, security forces rushed to the place and cordoned off the area before launching an offensive.\n\nA heavy gun battle continued for more than an hour during which “three attackers have been killed”, security officials said. Vehicles of the security forces were damaged during the fire exchange, which compelled terrorists to flee.\n\nThey said security forces foiled the strategy of the terrorists and got free the passengers who had been held hostage at gunpoint.\n\n“Security forces are chasing the fleeing terrorists in the mountains,” the officials said, adding that Quetta-Sibi highway that remained closed for four hours has been reopened for traffic.\n\nDistrict Police Officer Kachhi (Bolan) Rana Muhammad Dilawar, while talking to Dawn said that a dead body and four injured persons were brought to District Hospital Mach from the area where the gun battle took place. The deceased was identified as Nabi Dad while the injured were Safiullah, Amanullah, Ghulam Rasool, and Aminullah.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 24th, 2025",
