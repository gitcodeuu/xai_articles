Harrapa police registered a case under sections 338, 376, 511, and 337 against the suspect.\n\nIn another incident, Ghala Mandi police booked five people, including Ali Haider and Abdur Rauf, along with three unidentified people, for beating Nazia Bibi and her brother in the main bazaar of village 90/9-L.
