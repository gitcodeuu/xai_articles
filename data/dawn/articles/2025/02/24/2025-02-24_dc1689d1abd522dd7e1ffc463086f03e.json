  "content": "CHITRAL: In his second attempt, James Walker Crawford, an American national, succeeded in hunting a 10-year-old Kashmir Markhor in the Chitral Gol National Park’s buffer zone here the other day under the recently introduced non-exportable trophy hunting scheme.\n\nThe markhor’s horns measured 41 inches. The US national had obtained permit from the wildlife department paying 52,000 US dollars (Rs14,534,000).\n\nThe members of village conservation committee of Rumbur and officials of Chitral Gol National Park headed by its divisional forest officer Rizwanullah provided assistance to the foreigner throughout the hunting process.\n\nThe American had earlier made an abortive attempt of hunting some days ago as the bullet of his shot missed the target.\n\nChairman of Chitral Gol Community Development and Conservation Association, Saleemuddin told Dawn that the trophy hunting in the buffer zone of the national park was a landmark in its history as it had been a longstanding demand of the community.\n\nHe said that due to the successful conservation undertaken by the community, the population of markhor had largely increased over the years with a good number of animals having attained the age and size of trophy hunting.\n\nHe said that he had approached the government to start exportable trophy hunting in the buffer zone of the national park by the next season keeping in view its strength.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 24th, 2025",
