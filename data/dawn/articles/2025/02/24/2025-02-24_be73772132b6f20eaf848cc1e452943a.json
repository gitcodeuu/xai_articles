Safieddine will be interred in his southern hometown of Deir Qanun al-Nahr on Monday.\n\nThe September killing of the charismatic leader — who led Hezbollah for more than three decades — in a massive Israeli strike. But Hezbollah, which dominated Lebanon’s politics for decades, has long had a support base in the country’s Shia community.\n\nAs the funeral began at the Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium, Israeli warplanes flew at a low altitude over Beirut in what Defence Minister Israel Katz said was a “clear message” to anyone who threatens Israel.\n\nIn a televised address at the ceremony, Nasrallah’s successor Naim Qassem said Hezbollah would keep following his “path”, and rejected any control by the “tyrant America” over Lebanon. “The resistance is not over, the resistance is still present and ready” to face Israel, he said.\n\nNasrallah speeches were blasted as the mourners raised their fists in the air and chanted: “We are at your service, Nasrallah.” Men, women and children walked in the biting cold to reach the site of the ceremony, which was delayed for months over security concerns.\n\n“When I saw the coffin, reality dawned upon me,” said Lara, 26, adding that she had a hard time coming to terms with his killing. “The pain is great… words cannot describe how I feel,” she added. Correspondents said the stadium, which can accommodate roughly 78,000 people according to organisers, was fully packed.\n\nAs crowds gathered, the official National News Agency (NNA) reported Israeli strikes in Lebanon’s south — including one that wounded a Syrian girl — and in the east.\n\nIsrael’s military said it had struck “sites containing rocket launchers and weapons” in those areas. Israel has carried out multiple strikes in Lebanon since a Nov 27 ceasefire deal with Hezbollah ended more than a year of hostilities including two months of all-out war.\n\nThe funeral comes days after the deadline for Israel to withdraw from Lebanon’s south, with Israeli troops pulling out from all but five locations. Both sides have accused each other of violating the truce. Both Lebanese President Joseph Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam delegated officials to attend the ceremony on their behalf.\n\nIran’s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei vowed “resistance” against Israel as Hezbollah held the funeral. He praised Nasrallah as “a great mujahid (fighter) and prominent leader” and Safieddine as “a close confidant and an inseparable part of the leadership”.\n\nIran’s parliament speaker Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf and Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi were in attendance at the funeral, with representatives of Iraq’s main pro-Iran factions also expected to come.\n\nSam Heller of the Century Foundation think-tank said it was “important for the group to demonstrate that it remains a major social and political force, despite some of the setbacks it’s been dealt”.\n\n‘Dearest to our souls’\n\nSince Saturday, roads into Beirut have been clogged with carloads of supporters travelling in from Hezbollah’s other power centres in south and east Lebanon.Khouloud Hamieh, 36, came from the east to mourn the leader who she said was “dearest to our souls”.\n\nHezbollah’s Al-Manar television said the movement deployed 25,000 members for crowd control. A security source said 4,000 troops and security personnel were on duty.\n\nCivil aviation authorities said Beirut airport would close exceptionally for four hours.\n\nA founding member of Hezbollah in 1982, Nasrallah won renown around the Arab world in May 2000 when Israel ended its 22-year occupation of south Lebanon following relentless attacks by the group under his leadership.\n\nIn the decades since, Lebanese have been divided over Hezbollah, with many criticising the group for initiating more recent hostilities with Israel in support of Hamas.\n\nLebanon’s President Joseph Aoun told a visiting Iranian delegation on Sunday that the war-scarred country was “tired” of external conflicts playing out on its territory.\n\nThe high-level delegation was in Beirut for the funeral of Hassan Nasrallah, the slain leader of Tehran-backed Hezbollah which fought a war with Israel last year that ended in a November truce.\n\n“Lebanon has grown tired of the wars of others on its land,” Aoun told the Iranian officials according to a statement shared by the newly appointed president, a former army chief seen as close to the West. “Countries should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries,” he added.\n\nLong the dominant force in Lebanon, Hezbollah suffered staggering losses in the war with Israel compounded by a seismic blow with the December fall of ally Bashar al-Assad in Syria — long used as the militant group’s weapons lifeline from Iran.\n\nHezbollah’s weakening allowed Lebanon’s divided parliament to elect Aoun, seen as Washington’s preferred candidate, after more than two years of presidential vacuum, followed by the approval of a new prime minister and government.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 24th, 2025",
