As a result of investigation, police had arrested two suspects — Armaghan and Sheraz — who disclosed that Mustafa was killed in DHA and they torched his body and his car in Hub.\n\nThe Balochistan police had found the body in the torched car and handed it to the Edhi Foundation for burial in their graveyard for unclaimed bodies.\n\nLater, the body was exhumed from the graveyard by a medical board on Friday for collection of DNA samples for his identification. Later, a Karachi University lab concluded that the DNA samples from the body were matched with Mustafa’s mother.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 24th, 2025",
