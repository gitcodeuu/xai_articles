Winner’s share of polled votes exceeded 50pc in 107 (18pc) constituencies and only 17 (3pc) constituencies had a winner’s share of polled votes below 25pc.\n\nHistoric trends\n\nThe trend of fragmented representation due to systemic inefficiencies remained consistent during the last five general elections, the analysis revealed.\n\nIn 2002, the winners of National Assembly seats represented only 47pc of polled votes. The proportion peaked at 50pc in 2008, but fell to 48pc in 2013 and 43pc in 2018.\n\nThe proportion in the 2024 election was 45pc.\n\nThe proportion of representation in terms of registered voters paints an even dismal picture.\n\nIn GE-2002, the proportion of all members’ votes constituted 20pc of the registered voters. It increased to 22pc in 2008, 26pc in 2013 but declined to 22pc and 21pc in 2018 and 2024, respectively.\n\nLow turnout\n\nThe report identified low voter turnout as a big concern, as the FPTP system “exacerbates the crisis” by rewarding candidates who secure the most votes in a constituency, regardless of whether they achieve majority support.\n\nThe results since 2002 showed that even though the absolute number of votes polled has increased steadily, from 30 million in 2002 to 61.2 million in 2024, voter turnout has fluctuated, peaking at 54pc in 2013 before declining to 48pc in 2024.\n\nVoter disengagement is reflected in the growing gap between those who did not vote and those who did, the report added.\n\nWhile 61m voters came out to vote, over 66m registered voters abstained from voting in 2024.\n\nMoreover, the choices of 53pc of the 61m who voted were not represented in the assembly formed following the elections.\n\n“These numbers highlight the representation deficits of the FPTP system,” it said.\n\nReforms\n\nFafen said the FPTP model is the simplest and most cost-effective electoral system.\n\nHowever, concerns regarding its representation deficit have led to calls for reforms to enhance the representative aspects of elections.\n\nThe report added that several countries, including India and the United Kingdom, have debated the shortcomings of the system.\n\n“Similarly, Pakistan’s FPTP system faces systemic concerns, along with the additional element of decl­ining turnout in recent elections.”\n\nThe report added that the distribution of polled votes among all candidates shows that elections are becoming more competitive due to the rising number of political parties and independent candidates.\n\nDue to the abundance of options on the ballot, “voters choices have become more diversified”, Fafen said adding that in its current form, the FPTP’s systemic limitations “do not account for votes cast for losing candidates”.\n\nThe report emphasised the need for an “informed and constructive debate” on the election system and urged the parliament to lead the reforms to enhance voter engagement and ensure more representative outcomes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 24th, 2025",
