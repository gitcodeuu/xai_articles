They have empowered local people, including women in remote areas, by offering modern skills and training across various sectors.\n\nHe made these remarks during a meeting with Balochistan Rural Support Programme (BRSP) Chairman Malik Saleem Anwar Kasi and CEO Dr Tahir Rashid on Wednesday.\n\nMr Mandokhail emphasised that NGOs, through their development programmes, have significantly improved the lifestyles of the people. He noted that good international private organisations focus on creating producers rather than consumers and help individuals become self-sufficient.\n\nThe governor expressed appreciation for the establishment of the Centre of Excellence at BUITEMS University, funded by the German government, and commended the entire team for their efforts. The opening ceremony of the centre will be held at the Governor House in Quetta soon.\n\nMr Mandokhail highlighted that these organisations take a community-based approach, with methods that are globally recognised, which is a distinguishing feature of the BRSP.\n\nHe praised the public services of all United Nations agencies and NGOs operating in the province, acknowledging their vital role in developing infrastructure in remote districts. He said the government is committed to supporting them in improving people’s lives.\n\nHe said the BRSP has played an outstanding role in supporting the rural areas of Balochistan, bringing billions of rupees in funding for the welfare of the poor. These funds are being used for initiatives such as providing clean drinking water, raising awareness about sanitation, education, and healthcare.\n\nGovernor Mandokhail pointed out that during natural disasters, NGOs have always been at the forefront, offering aid and relief to flood and earthquake victims. They have worked on restoring ecosystems, promoting health and education, and creating employment opportunities for the people of Balochistan.\n\nHe emphasised the modernity of international organisations, especially in Balochistan, where NGOs have provided training to thousands of individuals, many of whom now hold key positions in various organisations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
