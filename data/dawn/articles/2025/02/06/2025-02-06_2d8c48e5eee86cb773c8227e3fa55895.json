  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A sharp loop in the newly constructed Jinnah Avenue underpass has raised question marks on the design of the project, as motorists are worried about the potential road clogs due to such a flaw in which three-lane road abruptly becomes a two-lane road after entering the underpass.\n\nJinnah Avenue, if one is moving from F-10 towards D-Chowk, has three lanes but the newly built underpass has eaten up one of the lanes. One lane has been used to build a loop for an exit towards 9th Avenue. The loop itself is problematic because of its dog-leg bend and a concrete wall right after it.\n\nIt is apparent that heavier vehicles will not be able to use this smoothly. “I fear whenever heavy vehicles, such as school buses and emergency cranes, will use this loop, their tailend will badly disturb the speedy traffic on this road,” said Ilyas Khan, a motorist.\n\nIt may be noted that in all other projects, the CDA builds an extra lane for loop to ease the flow of heavy traffic, but in this project, it has surprisingly reduced one lane.\n\nSharp loop inside underpass eats up one lane; official claims no flaw in design of loop\n\nA former government official, who lives in F-11 and uses this road for commute, said the CDA should look into the issue as after the construction work at the F-10 roundabout, the flow of traffic would increase which could lead to traffic congestion in the underpass. This is not the first time that a CDA project has had a design flaw. The civic agency made a blunder in the design of the roundabout outside the Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE) in H-8/4. This roundabout has created at least three points where traffic coming from different directions converges and it is often facing traffic mess during rush hours.\n\nThe said underpass of Jinnah Avenue was completed in 42 days. It is part of the Jinnah Avenue interchange project worth Rs4.1 billion, which has two components – an underpass (already completed) and a flyover, which is underway. According to the CDA, the flyover will be completed on February 14.\n\nSeparately, a CDA statement said Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa along with the relevant officers visited the Jinnah Avenue Interchange project and reviewed various construction activities, including the under-construction flyover bridge and road infrastructure.\n\nThe press release said that during the briefing, it was highlighted that asphalt work was progressing rapidly on the roads surrounding the Jinnah Avenue Interchange project, and construction on the protected U-turn being built on 9th Avenue adjacent to the project was also moving ahead.\n\nThe CDA chief was briefed about the construction of a protected U-turn at the F-10 roundabout and adjacent F-10 road. It was further informed that the construction activities at the F-10 roundabout would be completed this month and opened to traffic. The chairman stated that consultants and resident engineers should ensure the highest quality of construction work on-site and guarantee its timely completion.\n\nCDA’s member engineering Syed Nafasat Raza, while giving a detailed version, said there is no flaw in the design of the loop.\n\n“The width of the loop is 30 feet with no height restriction. All types of vehicles can use it smoothly,” he said, adding that the loop was designed in accordance with international engineering standards.\n\n“It is not the way people look at this loop..turning radius is safe,” Mr Raza said, adding that the CDA and traffic police will have to ensure speed limit and for this loop, the speed limit is 50km per hour.\n\n“We are also going to take safety measures which include separate colouring of lanes, direction boards, signage etc. We will take all precautionary measures,” the CDA member engineering said.\n\nWhen asked why an extra lane was not constructed for the loop, Mr Raza said: “I have already said, the loop and underpass were constructed in accordance with international standards, there is no need to be worried.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
