A detailed report on the findings and actions taken may kindly be submitted to this division, the letter signed by Deputy Director Quality Assurance Hafiz Sanaullah Babar stated.\n\nIn a letter written to Drap, PPA Vice President Shifa Khan Bangash had stated that medical devices were one of the key health technologies playing a pivotal role in the healthcare system and these were the mainstay of the diagnostic facilities leading physicians to accurate diagnosis and ensuring optimum patient outcome.\n\nThe diagnostic reagents and diagnostic kits are crucial medical devices in this context and the quality of which directly correlates with the accuracy of diagnosis and can help or otherwise mislead the physician in taking appropriate decision regarding treatment of patient. Erroneous diagnostic tests mislead physician/surgeon about the treatment which may even result in death, Mr Bangash had said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
