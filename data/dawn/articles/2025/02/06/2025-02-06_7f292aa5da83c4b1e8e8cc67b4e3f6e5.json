The DFC further said that the news of the girl’s death spread in the area as the deceased was laid to rest in a local graveyard at about 2pm on Tuesday.\n\nPolice will file a request in the court of law to get permission for the exhumation of the body to ascertain the real circumstances and the cause of her death. A senior police officer confirmed that the incident had come to their knowledge and police were investigating it. According to the postmortem report, the legal proceedings will be initiated accordingly.\n\nLast week, the Jatli police arrested four suspects after the exhumation and the initial report revealed that the 21-year-old girl had been poisoned by her sister’s in-laws to cover up her rape. The orphan girl was sexually assaulted for months allegedly by her brother-in-law and his accomplice who killed her and laid her to rest in the Jatli area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
