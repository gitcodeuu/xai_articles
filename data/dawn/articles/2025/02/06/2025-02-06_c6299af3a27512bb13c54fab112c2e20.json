The council has seven joint working groups focused on political coordination, trade and investment, energy, banking and finance, transport and communications, culture and tourism, and education.\n\nDuring the meeting, the two sides also discussed enhancing cooperation in organic farming, fisheries, water resources, nursery techniques, and aquaculture breeding.\n\nExperts from both countries participated in the meeting, where various areas of cooperation were discussed in detail. Both sides agreed to share contact points to facilitate further collaboration and to connect private sector stakeholders from both countries. Turkiye committed full support to enhancing Pakistan’s agricultural production.\n\nThey acknowledged the strong historical and cultural ties between Pakistan and Turkiye and emphasised the significance of agriculture and livestock as key pillars of the economy. They agreed to work together on innovative solutions to enhance cooperation.\n\nDespite having vast agricultural land and favourable conditions, Pakistan’s farm exports remain below potential. The collaboration with Turkiye is expected to improve production and exports significantly.\n\nThe ministry reiterated its commitment to advancing agri­c­ulture and livestock sectors through long-term international partnerships.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
