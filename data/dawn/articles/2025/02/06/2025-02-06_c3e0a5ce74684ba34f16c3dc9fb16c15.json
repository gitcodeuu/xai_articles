  "content": "KHYBER: Mystery has shrouded the murder of two Tirah traders here following the issuance of contradictory statements about it by two terrorist groups.\n\nBodies of Haji Sher Mohammad and his colleague and close relative Ibrar Afridi, with their throats slit, were found in a hilly area of Bhutan Shareef in Tirah valley early on Tuesday after the two remained in captivity of abductors for five days.\n\nKhurasan Network of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan, a proscribed terrorist organisation, shared a video of the two hostages on its Facebook page after their murder, with Ibrar narrating the details of their activities on Jan 25 when they met some TTP terrorists. Haji Sher was seen sit tense.\n\nThe TTP had accused the two of spying on their men and blamed the subsequent killing of its four activists, including Abdul Aziz alias Qari Ismail and Mukhlis.\n\nIn a statement issued by Hamdan Tehreeki with the picture of former TTP leader Hakeemullah Mehsud denied the group’s involvement in the killing of the two traders.\n\nIt claimed that Haji Sher Mohammad, president of Tirah trader association, and Ibrar Afridi were kidnapped by the TTP on Jan 30 over suspicion of involvement in the killing of four TTP members on January 25, but they were freed after being found innocent after an extensive interrogation-cum-investigation by the outfit’s intelligence wing.\n\n“Some miscreants killed the two traders soon after their release that we condemn as the TTP is not in favour of punishing innocent people.”\n\nDawn tried in vain to reach the jirga members who held talks with suspected terrorists to secure the release of the two hostages as their mobile phones were switched off.\n\nLocal sources said that Haji Hazrat Khan, local emir of the Jamiat Ulama-i-Islam-Fazl, who led the jirga, went into hidingafter the two captives were found dead as he and his colleagues wanted to avoid any interaction with media or government officials.\n\nMeanwhile, the situation in Tirah valley in general and at the Bagh-Maidan Markaz in particular remained sombre, with most shopkeepers and traders keeping mum over the murder of their leader.\n\nHowever, no protest was staged by traders or political activists against the killings.\n\nClose associates of Haji Sher Mohammad claimed that the trader leader didn’t spying for security forces and remained neutral in the ongoing situation.\n\nThey said that Haji Sher was instrumental in the rehabilitation of the Bagh-Maidan Markaz and revival of trading activities in Tirah while forcefully advocating for restoration of durable peace in the valley.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
