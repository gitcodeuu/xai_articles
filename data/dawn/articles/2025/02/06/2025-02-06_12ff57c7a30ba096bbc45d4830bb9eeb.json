  "content": "KARACHI: Recently notified by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) to look into the well-being of female bear Rano housed at the zoo, the committee in its report has recommended its DNA testing and relocation to a sanctuary in Punjab, it has emerged.\n\nLed by Prof Muhammad Zaheer Khan associated with Karachi University’s zoology department, the committee was comprised of Dr Iqbal Saeed Khan, Deputy Director Zoo Dr Amir Ismail and Deputy Wildlife Conservator Adnan Hamid Khan.\n\nThe report, a copy of which is available with Dawn, states that the members noticed “unusual behaviour” of the brown bear, suggesting she was “under stress”.\n\nWhile the committee expressed satisfaction over bear’s diet, physical health, finding no wound/injuries on her body, it noticed “heavy noise” during the visit. The report says that the noise seemed to be “beyond the permissible decibels”.\n\nThe committee after detailed discussion recommended that “the species must be identified through DNA sequencing for confirmation of its subspecies from any recognised laboratory/organisation.\n\n“The species may immediately be transferred to the bear sanctuary at Balkasar till confirmation of the species/subspecies through DNA sequencing. Any two members nominated/advised by the senior director will visit the bear sanctuary to check the facility before shifting of the female brown bear,” the report says.\n\nIt suggests that the competent authority may take a decision to shift the bear to an appropriate habitat once her species is confirmed. The experts have scheduled a follow-up meeting this week.\n\nThe Karachi mayor, taking notice of concerns over Rano’s solitary confinement, had directed concerned officials to set up a committee to check her well-being and submit a report.\n\nAnimal rights activists say that Rano is a Himalayan brown bear — a critically endangered species — and not a Syrian species as claimed by zoo officials.\n\nLanguishing in a barren cage, Rano was reportedly brought to the Karachi zoo in 2017 along with an Asiatic black bear who died in 2020. The activists demand that Rano should be sent to Balkasar sanctuary in Punjab — the only bear-specific sanctuary in Pakistan.\n\nAlso known as the Himalayan red bear, the Himalayan brown bear is a subspecies of the brown bear found in the western Himalayas. It is the largest mammal in the region, with males reaching up to 2.2 meters (7.2 feet) in length, while females are a little smaller.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
