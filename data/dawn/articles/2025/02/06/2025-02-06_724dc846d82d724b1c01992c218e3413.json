The inter-services monitoring mission is expected in mid-2025 as part of the ongoing process,” the EU representative said in response to a query on Feb 2.\n\nThe businessman from the textile industry, who requested not to be named, apprehends that any negative review of the GSP+ status could further plunge the sector into crisis because, in the hope of sending more textile products’ export consignments to Europe after winning handsome contracts in the recent textile fair in Germany, textile mills have purchased duty-free cotton and cotton yarn in large quantities from abroad.\n\nAs the import of cotton and cotton yarn is duty-free, while there is an 18pc tax on local cotton, the millers have been importing the commodities in large quantities from abroad this year at the cost of growers, ginning and spinning sectors.\n\nThe data released by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics reveals that the country spent a record $1.91 billion on the imports of cotton and yarn in the first half of FY25, a surge of $0.610bn over the same period last year.\n\nReports suggest that large shipments of cotton and cotton yarn are also expected during January-March 2025 at the cost of precious foreign exchange.\n\nCotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsanul Haq says that though total domestic cotton production this year has been about 50pc less than the target and 34pc less than the last year’s production, there is an increase in cotton stocks in ginning factories. As of Jan 31, at least 486,000 bales of cotton are lying with the ginning factories, 114,000 bales or 31pc more than last year.\n\nHe says that textile mills have so far purchased only 4.978m bales from local ginning factories during the ongoing season, which is a record 2.7m bales or 35pc less than the purchases of last year during the same period.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
