We want all disputes, including Jammu and Kashmir, to be resolved through peaceful means based on democratic and diplomatic principles. This is essential for the development and prosperity of billions of people living in this region,” the prime minister said in his address to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Legislative Assembly, presided over by Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar.\n\nThe session was among a slew of activities held across the country as well as in many other parts of the world to mark Kashmir Solidarity Day, a yearly national feature to manifest support for the Kashmiris fighting Indian occupation of their motherland with dauntless bravery.\n\nAfter landing in Muzaffarabad, PM Shehbaz first visited a grand Martyrs’ Monument, where he was also joined by Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir. Both laid floral wreaths at the monument and observed a one-minute silence to pay homage to the fallen heroes of the Kashmir freedom movement.\n\nWhile the prime minister drove to the Legislative Assembly, the army chief went to a nearby military installation where he interacted with a select group of notables and veterans.\n\nEarlier in the day, symbolic human chains were formed at key points linking AJK and Pakistan, including Kohala and Bararkot in the Muzaffarabad division, Azad Pattan and Tain Dhalkot in the Poonch division, and Mangla and Holar in the Mirpur division.\n\nIn Kohala, cabinet member Bilal Yasin from Punjab and MPA Dr Ashok Kumar from Balochistan were also among the attendees.\n\nIn Muzaffarabad, a friendly cricket match between Srinagar Eleven and Jammu Eleven was held at Narul Stadium, with former Pakistan captain Shahid Khan Afridi as the chief guest.\n\nElsewhere, rallies, demonstrations, public meetings and seminars were held in almost all towns and cities, including areas along the Line of Control (LoC), to send a loud message of solidarity and support across the divide.\n\n“I have come as a representative of Pakistan’s 240 million people to assure you that we stand shoulder to shoulder with you in your struggle until the blood spilt in the valley secures your freedom,” PM Shehbaz said in his speech to the AJK Assembly.\n\nHe warned India against the misconception that it could strip Kashmiris of their identity or displace them from their homeland through draconian, oppressive and fascist laws.\n\n“The issue will not be resolved by spilling Kashmiri blood, demolishing their homes, carrying out extrajudicial killings, martyring children, torturing and imprisoning leaders, or turning occupied Kashmir into a massive military garrison,” he said.\n\nHe asserted that the democratic rights of the people of occupied Palestine and Kashmir were supported by democratic nations, institutions, organisations and people worldwide, as well as by international laws and principles.\n\n“There cannot be different standards for justice, democracy, and the enforcement of international law. This is the demand of justice, democracy, and international law, as well as of humanity, for which we will continue to raise our voice on every global forum,” he affirmed.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz also made it clear that Pakistan’s commitment to peace should not be mistaken for weakness.\n\n“Our pursuit of peace is rooted in the enlightened principles of our faith, the democratic ideology of our forefathers, and the strength of our system. Pakistan is a nuclear-armed state with a highly skilled and professional military that serves as an unbreakable shield for national security,” he said.\n\n“From the creation of Pakistan to the present day, we have always responded decisively to acts of aggression,” he added, citing Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav and captured pilot Abhinandan as living testimonies to Pakistan’s military prowess.\n\nHe warned that, if necessary, Pakistan would use its full strength to safeguard its national interests without hesitation.\n\nEarlier, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwarul Haq and Leader of the Opposition Khawaja Farooq Ahmed also spoke and thanked the government and people of Pakistan for standing by the Kashmiris through thick and thin.\n\nAccording to a press release by ISPR, the military’s media affairs wing, the COAS reaffirmed the Pakistan Army’s commitment to national defence, making it clear that any act of aggression would be met with a decisive response.\n\nDuring his interaction with notables, who included former AJK premier Sardar Tanveer Ilyas, he reaffirmed that Pakistan would always stand by the Kashmiris in their just and legitimate cause against state-sponsored repression and oppression.\n\n“Without any doubt, Kashmir will be free one day and part of Pakistan as per the free will and destiny of the people of Kashmir,” he said.\n\nGB expresses solidarity\n\nIn Gilgit-Baltistan, Kashmir Solidarity Day was observed with rallies, resolutions and public demonstrations. The GB Assembly unanimously passed a resolution reaffirming the region’s unwavering support for Kashmiris’ right to self-determination.\n\nRallies were held in Skardu, Gilgit, Ghizer, Hunza, Nagar, Astore, Shigar, Kharmang and Ghanche, with banners displayed across buildings and streets highlighting the plight of Kashmiris.\n\nThe main rally in Gilgit, which began at Aga Khan Shahi Polo Ground and passed through Raja Bazar before culminating at Etihad Chowk, saw participation from ministers, opposition and treasury members, government officials and activists from various political and religious groups.\n\nJamil Nagri in Gilgit also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 6th, 2025",
