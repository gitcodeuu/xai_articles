Additionally, he met Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to discuss shared security challenges and the importance of enhanced collaboration between the two nations.\n\nAs part of his itinerary, the army chief will also visit key British Army units, including the Land War­fare Centre and the 1st Strike Brig­ade, where he will receive briefings on the UK Army’s modernisation and operational strategies.\n\nThe source said that the visit was historic as it was meaningful and result-oriented, adding that the UK has offered to enter a joint venture with Pakistan’s defence industries, including Pakistan Ordina­nce Factories, Heavy Industries Taxila, and maritime cooperation in shipbuilding, command and surveillance equipment, subsystem assemblies, and system integration.\n\nAdditionally, the source said it’s the first time that UK forces are showcasing their niche capabilities in both the technical and doctrinal domains to Pakistan’s COAS.\n\n“They are demonstrating their most sophisticated gadgetry for land forces, cyber operations, surveillance equipment, and long-range capabilities.”\n\nThe results include the “initiation of 35 projects related to military engagement, social collaboration, and diaspora outreach”, including a possible commitment that graduates from army public schools in Pakistan may be eligible for a 30pc discount in the tuition fees of mainstream UK universities, with 40pc off fees for martyrs’ families.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 20th, 2025",
