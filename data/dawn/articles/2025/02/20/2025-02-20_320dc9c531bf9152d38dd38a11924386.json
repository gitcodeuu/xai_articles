  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The chairman of the Senate committee on maritime affairs has ordered the cancellation of all allotments within the Port Qasim area after “shocking details” emerged about a deal under which land spread over 500 acres was sold at throwaway prices.\n\nFaisal Vawda, the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Maritime Affairs, estimated that Port Qasim had suffered a colossal loss of Rs40-60 billion because of “shady transactions”.\n\n“Land worth Rs40 million per acre was sold at a rate of Rs 1m per acre, causing a massive loss of Rs40-60 billion to the exchequer. This deal, which includes the sale of 200 acres of land separately, has caused a Rs60 billion loss to the national treasury.\n\n“This cannot be allowed to continue,” Faisal Vawda said while chairing a meeting of the committee on Wednesday. He directed the cancellation of these allotments and instructed the authorities concerned to prepare a report to identify the individuals involved.\n\n“The individuals responsible will be made accountable to the National Accountability Bureau and other agencies. We will use all means to fix these issues.”\n\nSenator Vawda expressed concern over similar allotments in the past, emphasising the need for transparency and accountability. “Billions of dollars have been lost. We will recover it and our measures will be strong. The matter will be referred to NAB, if required, as well as other authorities concerned for investigation.”\n\nIn his reply, Minister for Maritime Affairs Qaiser Sheikh stated: “To my knowledge, there is no such transfer that took place without the permission of the board, However, we will collect all necessary details regarding the matter.”\n\nHe went on to highlight the serious issues faced by the maritime sector, mentioning the stagnation in various projects, including fisheries, over the last several years. “Even though many projects are stalled, salaries are being paid in crores,” Qaiser Sheikh said.\n\nThe committee also discussed broader challenges facing the country’s maritime infrastructure, especially in Karachi and Gwadar.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 20th, 2025",
