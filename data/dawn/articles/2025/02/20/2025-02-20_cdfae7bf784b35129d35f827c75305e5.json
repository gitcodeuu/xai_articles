He argued that if the matter is treated as review hearing, it would not be possible for the CB to take a different view unless there were errors such as non-consideration of admitted facts by the earlier bench, error of law or any patent and substantial illegality or the judgment was per incuriam.\n\nThen what should be the parameters to modify the earlier verdict, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar questioned. It was necessary to develop certain parameters as the earlier decisions could not be held wrong without reasons, rather they had to be treated with respect while maintaining certain norms and decorum, he observed.\n\nJustice Aminuddin Khan wondered when even judges sitting on the CB had their own opinions, how the counsel could argue the present bench could not change the opinion rendered by the earlier bench in October 2023.\n\nReferring to Article 245, Mr Khan’s counsel argued that the armed forces were part of the executive and therefore could not act in any manner or exercise any judicial function with regard to civilians. The armed forces cannot operate outside the ambit of Article 245, he insisted.\n\nJudicial commission\n\nEarlier, Sardar Latif Khosa while representing Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan requested the CB to order setting up of a judicial commission to ascertain why police did nothing to stop the May 9 violence that spanned over four to five hours. He argued that the commission would help ascertain if the events were “orchestrated” and why only 105 people out of 5,000 arrested were subjected to military trials.\n\nAt this, Justice Musarrat Hilali asked if the counsel wanted to see dead bodies on roads if the police had attempted to control the unruly mobs on May 9.\n\nThe counsel then questioned why the government was reluctant to ascertain real facts, saying that nobody could dare to enter the corps commander house, Lahore.\n\nHe cited a report of International Commission of Jurists (ICJ), stating 646 trials of civilians were conducted by the military courts. Of them, 641 civilians were convicted and 345 were awarded death sentences and in all such cases the primary source of evidence were “confessional statements” of the defendants.\n\nAt this, Justice Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi remarked Pakistan remained a victim of terrorism much more than many other countries, wondering how many incidents of terrorism had been witnessed by ICJ member countries.\n\nThe counsel claimed that countries like Turkiye witnessed some terrorism incidents, but they had done away with military trial of civilians. He also cited the UN Committee against Torture, which took notice of civilians’ trial by the military courts in Pakistan.\n\nJustice Mazhar, however, wondered whether parliament had taken any consideration of the reports the counsel referred to.\n\nJustice Mandokhail asked the counsel not to cite ICJ report when the matter pertained to the constitutional amendment and the appeals of many convicts were pending before the apex court.\n\nThe counsel, however, said the establishment of military courts should be seen in historical context. He said Islam also emphasised on the “independence of the judiciary”.\n\nJustice Mandokhail wondered what steps Sardar Latif Khosa took to abolish section 2(1)(d)(i) and (ii) of the Army Act as federal minister, senator, MNA, governor and attorney general and why no parliament ever abolished the section till date.\n\nThe counsel told the judges that people would become their fans if the CB ruled against civilians’ trial by military courts, recalling how the 26th Amendment was bulldozed through parliament by forcing lawmakers to vote for the amendment.\n\nWhen Justice Hilali wondered which legislator resigned after the 26th Amendment, the counsel reminded her that Akhtar Mangal had resigned from the National Assembly.\n\nAt the outset, Barrister Aitzaz Ahsan disowned Advocate Salman Akram Raja’s reservations over certain parts of October 2023 judgement given by Justice Munib Akhtar. Barrister Aitzaz said Salman Akram Raja was his counsel, too, and he had never given any instructions to him in this regard, making it clear that he completely supported Justice Akhtar’s decision.\n\nSalman Akram Raja, however, said he had advanced arguments on behalf of his client Arzam Junaid. He also explained that he disagreed to only one paragraph of Justice Akhtar’s decision.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 20th, 2025",
