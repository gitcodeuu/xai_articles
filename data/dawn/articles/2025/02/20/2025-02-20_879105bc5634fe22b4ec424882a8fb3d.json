According to the directive, Altaf Hussain, assistant superintendent/in-charge admin block; Sajjad Haider Shah, assistant superintendent/in-charge central tower/narcotic blocks; Muhammad Riaz, head warder (chief in-charge barrack # 6-8; and warders Muhammad Ammar Zahoor and Sher Zaman.\n\nIGP Nazir also issued a notice to the Rawalpindi Region Jail DIG, seeking a report on the disappearance of the UTP and issued orders for an inquiry.\n\nHe hoped that the suspect would be arrested soon as the police were after him, while strict departmental action would be taken against anyone found guilty of negligence in the inquiry report.\n\nAdiala is the highest security prison due to the presence of high-profile prisoners, including PTI founder Imran Khan. The escape of the prisoner has sparked concern among the security officials and raised many questions.\n\nIGP revealed that Nouman Masih, a suspect facing a 9(1)b case, was found missing on Tuesday night. He reportedly managed to come out with other prisoners who were going to court. However, search parties were trying to reach and re-arrest him.\n\nThe IGP said that an inquiry was underway to fix the responsibility and take action against the shirkers. “Escapees’ location is traced, hopefully he will be re-arrested shortly,” the IG claimed.\n\nAccording to sources, an under-trial prisoner, Nouman Masih, was arrested in a narcotics case by the Bhara Kahu police in the first week of January. On Tuesday evening, the police transferred him to the jail and handed him over to the jail staff, but he was found missing on Tuesday night. After the jail staff received him and the prisoners were counted in the barracks, he was found missing.\n\nAfter his disappearance, the jail authorities were in a state of panic and the matter was kept secret. A search started to locate the missing prisoner was launched, but it remained unsuccessful.\n\nSources said that when the CCTV footage was checked by the jail’s security staff, the prisoner mysteriously crossed the three doors of the jail, including the main gate, one by one, and after finding them open, slipped away. There are some speculations that the under-trial prisoner managed to escape from jail disguised as a labourer engaged in the ongoing construction work on the jail premises.\n\nMeanwhile, IG Prisons Mian Farooq Nazir took notice of the escape and sought a report from Rawalpindi Region DIG Prisons Abdul Rauf Rana and issued orders for an inquiry. The IG claimed that the staff of the prison department and the police were in pursuit of the prisoner, who would be arrested soon.
