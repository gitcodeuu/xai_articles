In Karachi, 10 SIMs were confiscated and a shop owner was taken into custody, the release read.\n\n“PTA remains committed to combating illegal SIM sales and urges the public to cooperate … in ensuring a secure digital environment,” the release concluded.\n\nLast week, the FIA stated that illegal international SIMs, particularly those from the United Kingdom, are being widely used in Pakistan for serious crimes, including child pornography, kidnapping for ransom and online financial fraud.\n\nAddressing a press conference, Additional Director General of the FIA Cybercrime Wing Waqaruddin Syed said that the cybercrime wing launched, for the first time, a crackdown on the unauthorised trade of illegal SIMs and as many as 44 suspects were arrested from Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Peshawar, Sukkur and Abbottabad.\n\nHe said that a total of 8,363 international SIMs from the UK were recovered, adding that 21 cases were registered nationwide.",
