  "content": "SWABI: Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf central leader and former National Assembly speaker Asad Qaiser has insisted that the party’s founding chairman Imran Khan will never make a deal under any circumstances to secure his release from jail, and that he would continue his struggle for the ‘supremacy of the Constitution’.\n\nSpeaking at the concluding ceremony of a two-day sports gala at the Women University Swabi, he said that ‘Imran would neither bow nor be intimidated’. “He stands firm and will continue to do so, Insha Allah,” he added.\n\nMr Qaiser vowed PTI would not be cowed down under any circumstances. “We will submit only before Allah,” he said. He insisted PTI’s struggle was solely for the supremacy of the Constitution and the rule of law in the country.\n\nQaiser says govt lacks public support for legislation\n\n“We strive for upholding supremacy of the Constitution, parliament and rule of law,” he said, adding PTI would continue its peaceful struggle.\n\nQaiser said only elected representatives chosen by the people should be in parliament, “not those imposed through Form 47”.\n\nHe maintained when such individuals occupied the parliament they passed laws against public interests, including Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca) and the “unjust” 26th Amendment.\n\nHe said the party had already filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court against the 26th Amendment. He emphasised the need for collective efforts to ‘build Pakistan in line with the Quaid-i-Azam’s vision’, ensuring the supremacy of law and the Constitution.\n\nHe also expressed hope that students would play a leading role in this movement.\n\nPEACE RALLY: A peace rally was held here the other day with the participants calling for effective measures to curb violent incidents as peace was a prerequisite for progress and prosperity.\n\nSwabi Action Committee (SAC) gave the call for the peace march.\n\nThe participants carried white flags, a sign of peace, and rejected the bloodshed, chanting slogans for restoration of peace to the region.\n\nThey said that 18 people had been killed over the last four days and the police had failed to prevent such incidents.\n\n“The culprits have no fear of police,” said Masood Jabar, former deputy general secretary of Qaumi Watan Party, and a participant of the rally.\n\nLed by Salim Khan Advocate, former provincial general secretary of Awami National Party, people belonging to different walks of life poured onto the Karnal Sher Khan Chowk, blocking Swabi-Mardan, Swabi-Jehangira, Swabi-Topi and Swabi-Maneri roads.\n\nThe commuters, especially women and patients, faced hardships as all roads remained blocked for three hours.\n\nAddressing the protesters at various places, Salim Khan said that institutions had failed to play their role in ensuring a peaceful environment for citizens.\n\nHe also complained about the police’s failure to crack down on drug smugglers, who were roaming the streets.\n\nPOWER CABLE STOLEN: Robbers took away 62 bundles of power cable from Pakistan-China Economic Zone of Rashakai in Chota Lahor tehsil here the other day.\n\nThe project director lodged a complaint with the police against unidentified robbers.\n\nThe district police officer formed an inquiry team, comprising Chota Lahor DSP Iqbal Khan, SHO Gohar Khan and investigation officer Namir Khan.\n\nThe DSP said the robbers cut off the transmission line before collecting 62 bundles of high-voltage transmission cable worth millions of rupees and running away.\n\nWhen contacted, SHO Chota Lahor City police station Gohar Khan said the police arrested Zubair Ahmad of Chilas, who confessed to the robbery and identified the place where stolen wires were kept.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 20th, 2025",
