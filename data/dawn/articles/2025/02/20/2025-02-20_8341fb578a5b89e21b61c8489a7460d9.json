Police had arrested both accused.\n\nDespite the presence of strict anti-rape laws in the country, which could result in the death penalty or imprisonment lasting from ten to twenty-five years, incidents of sexual assault continue across the country.\n\nData collected by the non-governmental organisation Sahil revealed that a total of 1,630 cases of child abuse were reported from across the country in the first six months of 2024.\n\nThe statistics included 862 cases of child sexual abuse, 668 cases of abduction, 82 cases of missing children and 18 cases of child marriages. In the six months, 48 cases of pornography after sexual abuse were also recorded.",
