  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Seven new judges of the Supreme Court and the acting chief justice of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) took oaths on Friday.\n\nChief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) Yahya Afridi administered the oath to the newly appointed judges at a ceremony held on the Supreme Court’s compound, with the iconic white marble building as the backdrop.\n\nThe ceremony was a deviation from past practices where the oath-taking of new judges was held inside the court’s Ceremonial Hall.\n\nThe judges who were administered the oath were justices Muhammad Hashim Khan Kakar, Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui, Salahuddin Panhwar, Shakeel Ahmad, Aamer Farooq and Ishtiaq Ibrahim.\n\nJustice Shah says ‘won’t accept defeat’, as rumours swirl of possible reference; new inductions take apex court strength to 25\n\nJustice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, who was appointed as the acting judge, was sworn in separately by the CJP.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Supreme Court judges, Attorney General for Pakistan Mansoor Usman Awan, senior lawyers, and law officers.\n\nJustice Aminud Din Khan, who was unwell and justices Muhammad Ali Mazhar and Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, who had gone to Karachi, didn’t attend the ceremony.\n\nWith new inductions, the total strength of the Supreme Court is now 25, including two ad hoc judges — Justice Sardar Tariq Mahmood and Justice Mazhar Alam Khan Miankhel.\n\nSoon after taking the oath, the judges joined a nine-member bench headed by the CJP, which heard around 10 cases in Courtroom No 1 of the apex court.\n\n‘Put up a fight’\n\nJustice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, the senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court, has vowed to “put up a befitting fight” amid reports of a possible complaint by the government against two judges of the top court.\n\nAfter the oath-taking ceremony on Friday, reporters asked Justice Shah about the remarks of PM’s aide Rana Sanaullah, who, without naming anyone, hinted at a possible “reference against two Supreme Court judges”.\n\n“The conduct of two senior judges of the Supreme Court … is such that a reference can be [filed] against them,” Mr Sanaullah had said.\n\nJustice Shah said the matter would be considered if any reference was filed. “We will not accept any defeat”.\n\nComplaints against top court judges are filed in the Supreme Judicial Council.\n\nJustice Shah is a member of the SJC, which is headed by the Supreme Court chief justice and includes the two senior-most judges of the apex court and chief justices of two high courts.\n\nDuring the media interaction, Justice Shah observed that “Allah Almighty is with us”.\n\n“We had done nothing wrong. Why should we be afraid of anything?” he said, adding that he had no personal grudge or difference against anyone.\n\nIn the face of serious differences among the top court judges, Justice Shah made some sarcastic remarks to make light of the situation.\n\nThe second senior-most judge of the Supreme Court said judges come to the court “only to sip tea”.\n\nThis was an apparent reference to a recent grievance by the CJP that some judges hearing corporate and tax matters were not working these days.\n\nHowever, after his jibe, Justice Shah hastened to add that the Supreme Court website will tell how many reported cases he has to his credit.\n\nWhen asked about the CJP’s statement that his fellow judges panic sometimes, Justice Shah laughed and said: “Look, our hands are trembling”.\n\nAnother Supreme Court judge, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, was asked whether he had seen the letter written by PTI founder Imran Khan to the CJP.\n\nHe denied receiving any letter, which the CJP said he had forwarded to the court’s Constitutional Commi­ttee, which fixes cases before judges.\n\nJustice Mandokhail is also a member of that committee.\n\nImran Khan wrote to the CJP over the delay in taking up petitions filed by his party under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 15th, 2025",
