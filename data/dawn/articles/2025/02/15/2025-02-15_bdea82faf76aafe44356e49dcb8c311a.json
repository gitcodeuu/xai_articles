Palestinian president Mahmud Abbas may also attend.\n\nDraft ideas will be discussed at the Feb 20 meeting in Riyadh. Proposals may involve a Gulf-led reconstruction fund and a deal to sideline Hamas.\n\nTrump sparked a global outcry with his proposal for the US to “take over” the Gaza Strip. Arab countries have come together in a rare united front, outraged by the idea of displacing the Palestinians.\n\nFor Palestinians, any forced displacement evokes memories of the “Nakba”, or catastrophe — the mass displacement of their ancestors during Israel’s creation in 1948.\n\nReuters spoke to 15 sources in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan and elsewhere to build a picture of the hurried efforts by Arab states to pull together existing proposals into a new plan they can sell to the US president.\n\nAll the sources declined to be identified.\n\nOne Arab government source said at least four proposals had already been drafted for Gaza’s future, but an Egyptian proposal was now emerging as central to the Arab push for an alternative to Trump’s idea.\n\nThe Egyptian proposal involves forming a national Palestinian committee to govern Gaza without Hamas involvement, international participation in reconstruction without displacing the Palestinians, and movement towards a two-state solution, three Egyptian security sources said.\n\n“We are telling the Americans we have a plan that works. Our meeting with MbS is going to be critical. He is taking the lead,” said a Jordanian official.\n\nThe White House did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Palestinian gro­ups in Gaza said they would release hostages Iair Horn, US-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen and Russian-Israeli Alexandre Sasha Trou­fanov on Saturday, in accordance with the ceasefire agreement.\n\nHamas said Israel was expected to release 369 Palestinian prisoners in exchange.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 15th, 2025",
