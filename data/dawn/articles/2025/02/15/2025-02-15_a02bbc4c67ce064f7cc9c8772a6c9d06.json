The driver probably tried to save the rickshaw.\n\nHe said that 11 passengers died and 35 injured. It is not clear if the rickshaw occupants are among the casualties. The dead and injured were shifted to three different health facilities including Rural Health Centre (RHC) Hingorja and Ranipur besides Gambat Institute of Medical and Sciences (GIMS) Khairpur.\n\nAccording to SSP Khairpur Tauheed Memon, the bus overturned after colliding with the rickshaw. “All dead and injured come from Burewala and were travelling to Sehwan to attend Qalandar’s urs”, he said. Initially, the injured and dead were shifted to RHC but now they were brought to GIMS Hospital, he added.\n\n“All legal formalities are being completed and then the injured and dead will be shifted to Burewala, Vehari,” he said. He added that the senior superintendent of police and Vehari deputy commissioner were in contact with the Khairpur police and administration.\n\n“We will be providing them transportation and food,” he said. He added that he had visited the spot to oversee the rescue operation. The SSP also said that injured and dead were being identified in hospital for legal formalities.\n\nQalandar’s Urs will begin on Feb 19 (18th Shabaan). The Sindh government has announced a holiday on Feb 19. Countless number of people converge in Sehwan every year to pay homage to Qalandar, a sufi saint. Usually, the devotees start gathering in Sehwan a couple of days before commencement of urs and leave after a couple of days when urs finishes.\n\nAccording to a report from April last year, citing officials, as many as 115 people were killed and 317 injured in a total of 97 traffic accidents on an incomplete section of the Indus Highway between Jamshoro and Sehwan during the last four years.\n\nA day ago, five occupants of a car died and six others in a sports utility vehicle (SUV) were injured when the SUV coming from the wrong side of the Indus Highway rammed into the car near Jamshoro’s Sann town.\n\nLast month, at least one person died and 11 others were injured as a Karachi-bound bus collided with a stationary trailer near Nooriabad on the M-9 Karachi-Hyderabad motorway. Over a week before that, two youths and a child were killed when two motorcycles were hit by speeding vehicles on Indus Highway in Jamshoro.\n\nOn January 9, a fatal collision between two cars near Dhabeji on the Karachi-Thatta section of the National Highway claimed four lives — including of a newly-wed man and his mother — and left six injured.",
