She said that the system would be introduced from grade 6 in April.\n\nShe explained that students would only be charged when they reached A’ Levels that too only half of the amount.\n\nMNA Dr Nafisa Shah raised concerns about equity in education, questioning the need to introduce the Cambridge system. “If our education system is strong, why are we sending valuable foreign exchange abroad?” she asked.\n\nShe inquired about the foreign exchange spent by the country’s elite on Cambridge and similar education systems, as well as the amounts students pay for International English Language Testing System (IELTS).\n\nDr Nafisa Shah argued that adopting Cambridge undermines Pakistan’s own education framework.\n\nMeanwhile, Farah Naz said she will come to the house with more information in this regard.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 15th, 2025",
