They have been admitted. Two of them whose condition is serious have been shifted to the ICU,” said Dr Wasim Baig, the spokesman for the hospital.\n\n“The mine workers were going to Shahrag Bazaar to purchase vegetables, food items and their other daily use items for next week,” the deputy commissioner said, adding that they usually go to Shahrag town every Friday, their weekly off.\n\nLevies officials said an improvised explosive device was used in the attack.\n\nLater, bomb disposal officials, who collected evidence from the crime-scene, said the IED was detonated with a remote control device and huge amount of explosive material was used in the attack.\n\nThe bodies of the victims would be dispatched to their native Swat areas.\n\nAmong the victims, Iqbal Hussain, Javed, Umer Ali, Dulatmand, Bacha Hussain, Hazrat Khan, Hanifullah Gul, Rehmatullah, Ayazullah and Rehmat Shahid were identified, while the injured included Mohtaram, Abdul Malik, Bakht Zahir, Yarzada, M.
