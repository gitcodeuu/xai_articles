  "content": "KARACHI: The Indian tax authorities have revo­ked the non-profit status of two independent media organisations: The Repor­ters Collective (TRC), a journalist association, and The File, a news site.\n\nReporters Without Borders (RSF) condemned the action in a statement released on Friday, describing it as an “offensive against the press” and calling upon the tax authorities to rescind the decision.\n\n“It is an intolerable attack on journalism and a dangerous precedent that could threaten all non-profit media organisations in India,” the RSF said in its statement.\n\nThe Reporters Collec­tive, a New Delhi-based association of reporters, said on Jan 28 that its non-profit status had been revoked by the tax authorities on the grounds that “journalism does not serve any public purpose and therefore cannot be carried out as a non-profit activity”.\n\nThe loss of this status subjects the organisation to the same taxes as commercial enterprises, jeopardising its financial viability.\n\nThe RSF said in its statement that it was “concerned about an emerging pattern of fiscal harassment” as The File fell victim to a similar decision in December.\n\nCélia Mercier, who heads the RSF’s South Asia desk, said: “By attacking independent media organisations under the pretext of tax regulations, the authorities are attempting to silence investigative journalists and dry up their financial resources.\n\n“To claim that journalism is only for profit and to deny its public interest ignores the very nature of the profession and the role it plays in a democracy.”\n\nInformation was essential to the proper functioning of democracies and it is thanks to journalists that citizens have access to reliable, independent and diverse information, the RSF chief added.\n\n“It seems the Indian authorities want to ignore international commitments, including the International Declaration on Information and Democracy.”\n\nThe RSF called for the immediate restoration of the non-profit status of The Reporters’ Collective and The File.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 15th, 2025",
