After the accident, the co-driver got stuck in the cabin.\n\nThe accident caused a massive traffic jam on Mai Kolachi Road, M.T. Khan Road and Boat Basin area, a traffic police spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Mai Kolachi Road was temporarily closed for traffic and with help of a crane, the train’s affected bogies and damaged trailer were removed after hectic efforts and the traffic was restored after 5pm.\n\nDIG Raza said the trailer driver was responsible for the accident and had managed to escape from the spot. The incident reportedly occurred when the trailer driver tried to cross the railway line at a time when the goods train was about to cross.\n\nEdhi volunteers managed to retrieve the stuck co-driver, identified as Abdul Sattar, safely after hectic efforts lasting for one and a half hours, said the spokesperson.\n\nHe was shifted to the Trauma Centre of the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi for treatment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 15th, 2025",
