He said Faiz wrote for people who were facing difficult situations, including the people of Palestine.\n\n“Faiz was an international poet whose poetry had no boundaries,” he added.\n\nActor and director Nandita Das from India said she was in Pakistan for the festival and to show solidarity. She said that she was visiting Lahore after an eight-year gap and was feeling at home and meeting old friends here. Ms Das said she made a film on Manto in which she incorporated Faiz’s poetry.\n\nLAC Board of Governors Chairman Razi Ahmed, speaking on the occasion, welcomed the Indian delegation to the festival. Ahmed said Lahore was the city of Manto, Faiz, Sadeqain and many other literary figures and artists.\n\nFaiz Foundation Trust Chairperson Saleema Hashmi welcomed the audience and the Indian delegation to the festival. She later also inaugurated the exhibition by Sarah Ahmad.\n\nHer artworks referred to local and international traumas absorbed by land and its inhabitants; we look at displacement in the regional US and Gilgit-Baltistan. It highlights these issues as part of larger patterns of colonial violence, land dispossession, and environmental injustice.\n\nHer work is enmeshed with nature: with its ability to effect healing, recognising the connective tissue binding us to the earth. It speaks of inter-connectedness; of humans with the earth; among humans, and to life. It reunites fragmented parts of land in a process of healing from displacement, both internal and physical. Destruction transmutes into a landscape of renewed hope.\n\nThe exhibition pays tribute to the resilience of people whose spirit refuses to be crushed, who resurrect a path through wreckage, cultivating new futures.\n\nA 90-minute documentary titled Suno Gup Shup based on a hit old PTV programme was also screened on the first day of the festival, followed by a discussion with the team of the hit play.\n\nThe session was moderated by Saleema Hashmi.\n\nDirector Farjad Nabi said he produced this documentary keeping in view the fact that the present-day social and political situation was not that rosy.\n\nHe said the social criticism in the TV programmes like Such Gup was still relevant.\n\nWriter Mohammad Hanif said he never met Shoaib Hashmi, but liked the TV programme.\n\nSamina Ahmed said Such Gup brought a wave of nostalgia, adding that she learnt a lot about humour and comedy during the production of the programme.\n\nNavid Shehzad said Shoaib Hashmi, who was her teacher, had a great sense of humour.\n\nShe said at times when she looked at things being done in society, she thought that had Shoaib Sahed been here, he would have written a script on it.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 15th, 2025",
