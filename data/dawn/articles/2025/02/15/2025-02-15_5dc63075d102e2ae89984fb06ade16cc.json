The incident has grabbed the nation’s attention and sparked outrage and protests, with students demanding better security on campus.\n\n“Suspects have been arrested in this case, and investigations are ongoing,” Tehran prosecutor Ali Salehi said on Saturday, according to the judiciary’s Mizan Online news website.\n\nSalehi added that authorities are working to apprehend “the perpetrator of this crime as quickly as possible and bring him to justice”.\n\nProtests on Friday attracted dozens of university students. The Ham Mihan daily said on its website that tensions escalated after plainclothes security forces had intervened.\n\nAccording to the official news agency IRNA, President Masoud Pezeshkian has asked Science Minister Hossein Simaei Sarraf “to follow up” on the case.\n\nSarraf said on Saturday that the head of Tehran University’s dormitory management had resigned in the wake of the killing. The minister also denied reports that students had been arrested following the protests.\n\nIran’s First Vice President Mohammad Reza Aref has ordered an “urgent and thorough investigation” into Khaleghi’s murder, IRNA said.\n\nGovernment spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani on Friday addressed the issue on X, stating that “the security of students and the peace of families is a duty and priority for the government.”\n\nMeanwhile, Tehran University’s caretaker head, Hossein Hosseini, expressed solidarity with students by attending their gathering on Friday night, IRNA reported.\n\nThe protests at Tehran University come more than two years after nationwide demonstrations swept Iran following the death in custody of Mahsa Amini in September 2022. Amini, a young Kurdish woman, died three days after her arrest for allegedly violating Iran’s strict Islamic dress code.\n\nUniversities, particularly in Tehran, have been at the forefront of the protests in Iran, including the 1979 protests during the Islamic revolution that toppled US-backed Iran’s shah.\n\nStudents at Tehran University also shaped a major wave of protests in 1999 after the closure of a newspaper critical of the government.\n\nKhaleghi’s body was laid to rest on Saturday at his home village in South Khorasan province, in eastern Iran.",
