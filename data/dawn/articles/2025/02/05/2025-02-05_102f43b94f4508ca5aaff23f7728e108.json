Every year, the UN General Assembly adopts a resolution that stresses the legal right of people to decide their own destiny,” the premier said, according to a statement from his office.\n\nRegrettably, despite 78 years having passed, the Kashmiri people have yet to exercise this inalienable right, he lamented. He said the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) remains one of the most militarised zones in the world, and Kashmiris are living in an environment of fear and intimidation.\n\nMeanwhile, during a daylong visit to the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital on Wed­nes­day (today), PM Shehbaz will reaffirm Pakistan’s unwavering commitment and support for the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nThe prime minister’s main engagement in Muzaffarabad will be an address to the AJK Legislative Assembly, Speaker Chaudhry Latif Akbar confirmed to Dawn. He added that before the prime minister’s address, the AJK premier and parliamentary leaders of various political parties would also speak.\n\nAccording to official sources, upon arrival in Muzaffarabad, the prime minister will first visit the grand Monument to Martyrs at Chattar Chowk, where he will lay a floral wreath in tribute to those who sacrificed their lives in the struggle against India.\n\nSources said that Chief of the Army Staff Gen Asim Munir would also join the prime minister in laying the wreath and offering Fateha for the fallen heroes of Kashmir.\n\nTorch rally in Muzaffarabad\n\nA torch rally and a candlelight vigil were separately held in Muzaffarabad on Tuesday evening to pay tribute to the Kashmiris resisting Indian oppression across the divide, on the eve of Kashmir Solidarity Day.\n\nThe rally was organised at Burhan Wani Chowk, a symbolic venue for pro-Kashmir events, shortly after sunset under the aegis of Pasban-i-Hurriyat Jammu Kashmir (PHJK), an organisation of post-1989 migrants from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nHolding flaming torches aloft, participants marched through the city’s main thoroughfare from Burhan Wani Chowk to Garhi Pan Chowk, seeking to draw the international community’s attention to the worsening situation in occupied Kashmir.\n\nAmong the participants, several carried the flags of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Pakistan, while others held a banner that read: “All Eyes on Jammu & Kashmir.”\n\nAddressing the rally, PHJK chief Uzair Ahmad Ghazali said the Kashmir issue remained a source of continuous tension between India and Pakistan, adding that millions around the world were demanding its just resolution.\n\nGB Assembly passes resolution\n\nThe Gilgit-Baltistan Assembly on Tuesday unanimously passed a resolution condemning India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir, reaffirming unwavering support for the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination.\n\nThe resolution was moved by ministers and members from both the government and the opposition and was read out by Minister Ghulam Muhammad. It declared India’s aggression and occupation of Kashmir on Oct 27, 1947, as a “black day” in history and stated that Kashmiris had never accepted Indian rule.\n\nTariq Naqash in Muzaffarabad and Jamil Nagri in Gilgit also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 5th, 2025",
