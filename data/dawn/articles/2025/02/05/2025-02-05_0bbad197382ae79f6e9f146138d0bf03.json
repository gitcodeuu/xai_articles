These issues have broadened the scope of maritime security, compelling nations to re-evaluate their strategies and policies.\n\n“Here no single country can address the complex challenges at sea alone. Therefore, we are ‘together for peace’”.\n\n“The primary objective of this exercise is to bring the maritime nations together to adopt safe and sustainable procedures, share experiences and collectively address maritime threats,” he said.\n\nThe Aman Exercise is divided into two phases: harbour and sea. The harbour phase, to go on from February 7 to 9, will include seminars, operational discussions, professional demonstrations, inter­national gatherings and sports fixtures.\n\nThe sea phase, from February 10 to 11, will feature tactical manoeuvers and maritime security exercises, including anti-piracy and counter-terrorism operations, search and rescue drills and live firing exercises.\n\nThe highlight of the sea phase will be the International Fleet Review, which will be witnessed by both foreign and national dignitaries onboard a Pakistan Navy Ship.\n\nRear Admiral Abdul Munib emphasised that the growing global participation in Exercise Aman reflects the international community’s confidence in Pakistan Navy’s role in collaborative maritime security.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 5th, 2025",
