She said the policemen began shouting and alleged that she was running a prostitution den, which she denied and told them about her actual job.\n\nThe woman said the policemen refused to listen to her. Meanwhile another cop entered her house with an unknown person and began beating him.\n\nShe further said that the suspects subsequently took her 14-year-old daughter and niece into another room and sexually assaulted them one after another.\n\nThe woman added that the suspects also recorded the incident and threatened that they would post the videos on social media if any complaint or case was lodged.\n\nThe woman pleaded to take action against those involved involved in raping her daughter and niece.\n\nA statement from the police spokesperson issued today said “timely action” was taken and three suspects were arrested while a search was ongoing for the other two.\n\nIt added that only one of the suspects was a policeman, who had gone to the crime scene “in his personal capacity and there was no police raid under way at the time of the incident.”\n\n“The post in-charge has also been suspended for not immediately informing the higher officers about the serious incident\n\n“The DIG (deputy inspector general of police) Operations is monitoring all the proceedings of the incident,” the statement said.\n\n“Whether it is a citizen or a police officer, no one is above the law.
