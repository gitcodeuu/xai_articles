Riyadh paused tentative talks on the matter early in the Gaza conflict and hardened its rhetoric as the war continued.\n\nThe foreign ministry’s statement came swiftly after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said establishing formal relations “is not only feasible, I think it’s going to happen”. His government remains opposed to the internationally backed two-state solution.\n\nSaudi Arabia does not recognise Israel, but since 2020 has been negotiating rapprochement in exchange for a US defence pact and Washington’s help on a civilian nuclear programme.\n\nAustralia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the country’s support for a two-state solution in the Middle East “remains the same”.\n\nAlbanese said he would not give a “daily commentary” on statements by Trump. Australia’s position “remains the same”, Albanese told reporters.\n\n“We have had a long-standing bipartisan position for a two-state solution,” he said, referring to the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel with both peoples living in “peace and security”.\n\n“We have not received any request regarding the rebuilding of Gaza,” the prime minister added. “What we have said, though, clearly we’ve supported a ceasefire. We’ve supported hostages being released. And we’ve supported aid getting into Gaza.”\n\nAustralian governments under different political parties had backed the creation of two states — “not just one” — for decades, Albanese said.\n\n“Australia’s position is the same as it was this morning, as it was last year, and it was 10 years ago,” he said. “That remains my position and it has been a bipartisan position up to this point,” he added.\n\nChina said it was opposed to the “forced transfer” of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip.\n\n“China has always maintained that Palestinian rule over Palestinians is the basic principle of the post-war governance of Gaza, and we are opposed to the forced transfer of the residents of Gaza,” foreign ministry spokesman Lin Jian said when asked about Trump’s plan at a regular press conference.\n\nRussia believes a settlement in the Middle East is only possible based on a two-state solution, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\n\nTrump, who has previously proposed the permanent resettlement of more than 2 million Palestinians from Gaza to neighbouring countries, said Gaza could become “the Riviera of the Middle East”.\n\nTrump’s comments are “unacceptable”, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said, adding any plans leaving Palestinians “out of the equation” would lead to more conflict.\n\nSpeaking to the state-owned Anadolu news agency, he said Turkiye would review the steps it had taken against Israel — cutting off trade and recalling its ambassador — if the killing of Palestinians stopped and their conditions changed.\n\nPalestinian fighter group Hamas rejected the proposal, branding it a“ racist“ idea aimed at eliminating the Palestinian cause. “The American racist stance aligns with the Israeli extreme right’s position in displacing our people and eliminating our cause,” Hamas spokesman Abdel Latif al-Qanou said in a statement.\n\nAnother official Sami Abu Zuhri said that Trump’s remarks are “ridiculous” and “absurd” and could destabilise the Middle East.\n\n“Trump’s remarks about his desire to control Gaza are ridiculous and absurd, and any ideas of this kind are capable of igniting the region,” he said.\n\nThe Palestine Liberation Organisation said that it rejected any plan involving the displacement of Palestinians.\n\nSecretary General Hussein al-Sheikh said the PLO “affirms its rejection of all calls for the displacement of the Palestinian people from their homeland” and renews its support for a two-state solution.\n\nUnited Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer said that Palestinians “must be allowed home” in Gaza.\n\n“They must be allowed home. They must be allowed to rebuild, and we should be with them in that rebuild on the way to a two-state solution,” Starmer told the UK parliament during his weekly questions session.",
