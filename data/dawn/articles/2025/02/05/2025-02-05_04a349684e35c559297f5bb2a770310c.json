Tehran has long said its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful and it has no intention to build nuclear weapons.\n\nBut with its regional allies either dismantled or gravely weakened since the start of the Hamas-Israel conflict in Gaza in October 2023, and mounting discontent among many Iranians at the state of the economy, analysts say the clerical establishment has few options other than to strike a deal with Trump.\n\nThe fall of Bashar al-Assad in Syria in December, a crucial ally of Tehran, has severely disrupted Tehran’s “Axis of Resistance”, a network of regional armed groups, militants and allied states, to counter Israel and the United States, while asserting its influence throughout the Middle East.\n\nIn 2018, then-President Trump ditched Tehran’s 2015 nuclear pact with world powers and reimposed sanctions that have crippled the country’s economy. The harsh measures prompted Tehran to violate the nuclear pact’s nuclear limitations.\n\nThe official also said Tehran disagreed with “any displacement of Gazans, but Iran-US talks are a separate matter”, referring to Trump’s remarks that the US would take over besieged Gaza and create a “Riviera of the Middle East” after resettling Palestinians elsewhere.\n\n“Iran does not agree with any displacement of Palestinians and has communicated this through various channels. However, this issue and the path of Iran’s nuclear agreement are two separate matters and should be pursued separately,” the official said.",
