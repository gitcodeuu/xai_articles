The tax is set to come into effect from the next fiscal year, starting July 1, 2025.\n\nRamazan Relief Package\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government will introduce the Ramazan Relief Pack­age this year without involving utility stores to curb corruption and prevent the distribution of substandard commodities, PM Shehbaz Sharif said on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a televised address at the fede­ral cabinet meeting, the prime minister said that complaints from the previous year’s package had prompted this decision.\n\n“I instructed months ago that this cannot go on with the utility stores,” the premier said, adding that the Ministry of National Food Security had been directed to develop an alternative solution.\n\nPM honours polio team’s sacrifice\n\nAbout the launch of the polio vaccination drive, PM Shehbaz mentioned the martyrdom of a policeman, Abdul Kha­liq, who was deployed on the security of the polio team in Jamrud. The premier paid tribute to Mr Khaliq’s sacrifice to make Pakistan a polio-free nation.\n\nHe also lauded the services of PM’s Coordinator on Health Dr Mukhtar, Polio Coordinator,Dr Ayesha Raza Farooq, secretary of health and polio vaccinators for their tireless efforts to rid the country of this disease.\n\nThe prime minister also highlighted his visit to Quetta, where he met security personnel injured in an anti-terror operation in Kalat. The operation resulted in the martyrdom of 18 security personnel and the elimination of 23 terrorists.\n\n“I met the injured [at the hospital]. They were in high morale and were even ready to sacrifice their lives for the country,” he said. “These are the martyrs and Ghazis who are resolved to rid the country of terrorism and striving day and night for the cause.”\n\nPM Shehbaz said the soldiers of the army, police, FC and Rangers sacrificing their lives were actually bearing the brunt of the disastrous policies of a government in the past when thousands of terrorists were set free.\n\nThe cabinet offered Fateha for the martyred security personnel and the fallen policeman.\n\nInflation decline\n\nThe prime minister expressed pleasure over the inflation coming down to a nine-year low of 2.4 per cent in January from 28.73pc in the same month a year ago.\n\nHe congratulated the entire nation, the cabinet members, particularly the finance minister, his team and the FBR, for their efforts during the last 11 months to bring the inflation down to the lowest level.\n\n“Now, we are fully striving to head towards economic growth… This is the main challenge. All of our energies will be focused on economic growth. Just like other targets, we will achieve this too,” he resolved.\n\nHe told the cabinet members that on Monday, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman sent a delegation to Pakistan and both sides signed an agreement under which Saudi Arabia would provide oil worth $1.2 billion on deferred payment.\n\nBesides, the Saudi Development Fund will provide a loan for a $40 million water supply scheme project in Mansehra.\n\nHe said that the entire nation would observe Kashmir Solidarity Day on Wednesday to express solidarity with their Kashmiri brethren.\n\nCabinet decisions\n\nThe federal cabinet formed a committee, led by Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, to accelerate the operationalisation of Gwadar Port.\n\nPM Shehbaz directed the committee to organise an international conference to promote Gwadar’s economic potential globally. He also sought detailed reports on imports and exports through the port.\n\nThe meeting was informed that dredging of Gwadar Port had been halted between 2018 and 2022 due to “criminal negligence” but was resumed in 2022-23, restoring the port’s original depth.\n\nThe meeting was also informed that several public welfare projects had been completed in Gwadar, including the Pak-China Friendship Hospital, Gwadar Institute of Technical Education, Pak-China Primary School, Gwadar Livelihood Project, Gwadar Fisheries Processing and Export Zone, and Gwadar Solar Park.\n\nThe government is also laying the Main Line-4 railway network to connect Gwadar with other parts of the country. Meanwhile, the Gwadar-Quetta Highway is operational, improving connectivity for Turbat, Hoshab and Panjgur.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 5th, 2025",
