  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A division bench of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday set aside the conviction of a terrorism suspect, allegedly belonging to the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).\n\nThe IHC bench comprising Justice Sardar Mohammad Sarfraz Dogar and Justice Mohammad Asif heard the appeal of Abdullah, who was sentenced five years’ imprisonment for possessing explosive substance.\n\nJudge Tahir Abbas Sipra of an antiterrorism court had convicted the appellant under Section 5 of Explosive Substance Act and handed down five years of rigorous imprisonment. The court had also ordered forfeiture of his properties.\n\nThe counsel for the petitioner, Maulana Wajeehullah Khan, contended before the court that the prosecution case was ‘contradictory’, as no incriminating evidence was produced during the trial to support the charges while the material placed before the court was insufficient to connect him with the crime.\n\nHe informed the IHC bench that the trial court had overlooked the facts while convicting his client.\n\nAccording to the FIR, police arrested the suspect from Islamabad’s Sector G-8 after seizing explosive substance found in his custody and during the interrogation, he disclosed his alleged links with the outlawed TTP.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 13th, 2025",
