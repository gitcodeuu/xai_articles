  "content": "The Champions Trophy is being revived after eight years with holders Pakistan hosting New Zealand in the opening game of the ninth edition on Wednesday.\n\nThe 2021 edition of the One-Day International (ODI) competition was initially scrapped by global body ICC in 2016, who wanted only one major tournament in each of the sport’s three international formats, prioritising the 50-over World Cup.\n\nThey reversed the decision in late 2021. With politically-estranged rivals India and Pakistan deciding not to visit each other for ICC tournaments, India will play their matches in a neutral venue in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe top seven teams from the 2023 World Cup qualified for the tournament, along with hosts Pakistan.
