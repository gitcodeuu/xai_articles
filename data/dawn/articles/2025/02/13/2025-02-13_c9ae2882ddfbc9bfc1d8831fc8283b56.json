They are Barkhan, Musakhel, Zhob division, Khuzdar, Washuk, Noshki and Panjgoor.\n\nUnder the second phase of the olive cultivation programme, commercial olive farming on 75,000 acres of land preferably in the identified clusters will be included in the programme.\n\nAn analysis on olive value chain carried out by the International Trade Centre of the United Nations pointed out that commercial plantation of olive crops has been overlooked in Balochistan.\n\nThe crop, due to certain characteristics such as low water requirements, drought tolerance, and high resistance against pest and diseases has become increasingly popular in recent times.\n\nIn olive plants, hardly any organic or inorganic fertilisers are used in the entire olive growing districts in the North-East and Central parts of Balochistan.\n\nIn Balochistan, the department of agriculture research arranged two small units for Khuzdar and two number for Loralai and very recently one number for Musakhel to provide olive processing facilities to farmers at their doorsteps to promote this new crop at production level.\n\nThe ITC report says that due to climatic favour, Balochistan olive has oil contents ranging from 18 to 22 per cent while in the Potohar area of Punjab the oil contents are 8 to 10 per cent.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 13th, 2025",
