The projects undertaken by the Aga Khan Rural Support Programme (AKRSP) have brought about an unbelievable change in people’s lives, he added.\n\nThe JI leader said seeds introduced by the AKRSP had enabled local farmers to produce high-quality potatoes and to earn good money.\n\n“Introduction of new fruit production techniques, training for local farmers and construction of irrigation channels in remote areas went a long way to empowering the poor.”\n\nHe said skill development programmes for the youth and women improved job opportunities.\n\nAmjad Hussain, a GB Assembly member and president of the PPP’s local chapter, said the Aga Khan had dedicated his life to philanthropy, especially in Pakistan.\n\nBaba Jan, a leader of the Awami Workers Party, recalled Prince Karim Aga Khan’s contribution to preservation of the region’s cultural heritage, citing the example of forts in Baltit, Altit, Shigar and Khaplu.\n\nProtection of environment, promoting female education in conservative areas, and improving access to healthcare are some of the countless endeavours undertaken by Aga Khan, Baba Jan said. The AKDN supported rural communities, set up women’s organisations and encouraged women to go into business by giving them small loans, he added.\n\nAli Haidar, a social worker, said the AKDN also supported the rehabilitation of families affected by climate change. It was the first to provide shelter to families displaced by melting glaciers in Ghizer, Nagar and Astore.\n\nFirst visit in 1960\n\nAfter his first visit to the region in Oct 1960, Prince Karim Aga Khan left no stone unturned to transform the Gilgit region from a backward area into a model of human development that is now the envy of the rest of the country.\n\nThe Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and other agencies launched projects for poverty alleviation, improving access to healthcare, lifting education standards, skills enhancement, and preservation of cultural heritage.\n\nThe Aga Khan Rural Support Programme, a non-profit organisation, was established in 1982 to help improve the quality of life of communities in Gilgit-Baltistan and Chitral.\n\nIt has a community-led approach and encourages an equitable socio-economic development.\n\nThe AKRSP has been working across all 10 districts of Gilgit-Baltistan and two districts of Chitral, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nThe organisation expanded its network to Sindh last year, reiterating its mission to ameliorate the suffering of the poor in the country’s rural areas.\n\nThe AKRSP’s fields of interest include agriculture and food security, climate resilience, health and nutrition, education and early childhood development.\n\nDay of mourning\n\nThe nation will observe a day of mourning on Saturday (Feb 8) to mark the demise of Prince Karim Aga Khan, according to a notification issued by the Cabinet Division.\n\nThe notification said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had ordered observance of the day to coincide with the funeral of Aga Khan.\n\nThe national flag will fly at half-mast across the country on the occasion.\n\nMeanwhile, the funeral of Prince Karim Aga Khan will take place at the Ismaili Centre in Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, at 11am on Saturday.\n\nThe event will be open to invited guests only.\n\nHe will be laid to rest at a private ceremony in Aswan, Egypt, on Sunday (Feb 9).\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 7th, 2025",
