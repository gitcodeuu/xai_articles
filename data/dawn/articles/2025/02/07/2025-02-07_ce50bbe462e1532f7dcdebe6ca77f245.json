  "content": "Sweden’s right-wing government said on Friday it would seek to tighten gun laws in the wake of the country’s deadliest mass shooting at an adult education centre where the attacker appeared to have used several of his licensed rifles.\n\nTen people were shot dead at the Campus Risbergska school in Orebro on Tuesday before the man believed to be the perpetrator — identified by a Reuters source and Swedish media as Rickard Andersson, a 35-year-old Swedish recluse turned a weapon on himself.\n\nPolice have not disclosed the names of the dead and injured but have said they hope to conclude the identification process on Friday. Among the victims were several Christians who fled persecution in Syria. Police say they have found no evidence of an ideological motive so far.\n\nThe government has agreed with its far-right backers in parliament to tighten up the vetting process for people applying for gun licences and to clamp down on some semi-automatic weapons.\n\nIt said the AR-15, an assault rifle based on a military design that has been used in many mass shootings in the United States, was the kind of gun it wanted banned.\n\n“In light of the horrible shooting in Orebro earlier this week we believe that the right balance is to roll back the regulation and prohibit that kind of weapon,” Justice Minister Gunnar Strommer told Reuters.\n\nHe said it was not clear yet what kind of guns had been used in the attack in Orebro and banning AR-15 weapons would be a “preventative measure”.\n\n“We know that kind of weapon, with some changes, can become very dangerous and also that it has been used in that kind of shooting in other countries,” he said.\n\nAR-15 rifles have been permitted for hunting since 2023 and Strommer said around 3,500 have been licensed since then.\n\nThe government said it also wanted to strengthen information sharing between the police and the National Board of Health and Welfare regarding individuals who should not be allowed to own guns for medical reasons.\n\n“We have to ensure that only the right people have guns in Sweden,” Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson told reporters while on a visit to Latvia.\n\nSweden’s main opposition party, the Social Democrats, welcomed the move but called for more far-reaching vetting and controls. “There is a before and after February 4,” Social Democrat lawmaker Theresa Carvalho told a press conference.\n\nPolice have not specified what kind of weapons were used in the attack, saying only that three rifles licensed to the suspected killer were found near his dead body. Local media have reported he had a hunting license.\n\nThe attack has also raised questions about whether security at Sweden’s schools needs to be better. Unlike in many other countries, schools are generally seen as semi-public spaces and rarely have any controls on who can go in and out.\n\nThe government is looking at speeding up legislation already going through parliament that would make it easier for schools to install surveillance cameras, Strommer told Swedish media on Thursday.\n\nPolice have said the suspect, who has not been formally identified, had permits for four rifles and that investigators found three weapons next to his dead body along with 10 empty ammunition magazines and large amounts of unused ammunition.\n\nSweden has a high level of gun ownership by European standards, though it is much lower than in the United States.\n\nMost weapons are held legally for hunting, but a wave of gang crime has highlighted the high incidence of illegal handguns.\n\nFigures from 2017 by The Small Arms Survey, a Swiss-based research institute, showed there were about 2.3 million guns held by civilians in Sweden.\n\nThat is around 23 guns per 100 people compared to 120 in the United States and 4.6 in Britain.\n\nThe attack has left Sweden in mourning and police are still trying to determine a motive.\n\nThey are looking into information he was at some point a student at the school.\n\nThe school has around 2,700 students, around 800 of whom are enrolled in Swedish For Immigrants courses, according to information provided by the local authority.",
