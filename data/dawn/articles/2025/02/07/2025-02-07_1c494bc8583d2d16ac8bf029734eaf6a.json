Paranal telescope operator Marcela Espinoza says it’s essential for Chile to preserve “the best skies in the world” so that other countries keep choosing the region to install their telescopes.\n\nThe European Southern Observatory is currently building the 1.45 billion Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) at the nearby Cerro Armazones. The main project scientists have pointed out is the Inna project, a mega green hydrogen and ammonia development by AES Andes, a subsidiary of the US AES Corporation.\n\nAES said that the Inna project, which began in 2021, had received no opposition on lighting issues until August 2024.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 7th, 2025",
