  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan’s transporters continued their strike on Thursday for the second consecutive day over alleged harassment at security checkpoints.\n\nThe closure of bus services to Khyber Pakht­u­nkhwa and Punjab left passengers stranded as they were compelled to use other modes of transportation.\n\nThe owners of private cars plying on these routes increased their fares due to the increased number of passengers, while the Peshawar-bound Jaffar Express and Karachi-bound Bolan Mail also witnessed an increase in the number of travellers.\n\nThe Balochistan government spokesman, Shahid Rind, has said discussions were ongoing with the bus owners to restore transport services to the two provinces.\n\nHowever, he clarified that transporters have been informed that the smuggling of any illegal item in public transport will not be tolerated and law enforcement agencies will take action.\n\nAccording to Mr Rind, the additional chief secretary (Home), Quetta Division commissioner and deputy commissioner met with the transporters and discussed their demands.\n\nHaji Saadullah Kakar, a spokesperson for the transporters, denied any negotiations and said the government had yet to contact them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 7th, 2025",
