India is due to host the bloc’s leaders later this year.\n\nThe Indian and US leaders, both of whom critics accuse of authoritarian tendencies, enjoyed warm relations when Trump was in the White House from 2017 to 2021.\n\nModi visited Trump in office in 2017 and 2019.\n\nHe also hosted Trump at a huge rally in his home state of Gujarat, while Trump returned the favour with a similar event in Houston, Texas.\n\n“There is an obvious convergence of interests between the two countries,” Misri said, which included “trade, investment, technology, defence cooperation, counter-terrorism [and] the security of the Indo-Pacific”.\n\nThe meeting will come days after a US military aeroplane flew back 104 Indian migrants, part of Trump’s overhaul of immigration.\n\nIndia’s foreign ministry said it was “firmly opposed to illegal migration, especially as it is linked to other forms of organised crime”.\n\nBut New Delhi’s Foreign Minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar on Thursday pointed out that the “process of deportation is not a new one”, and that the US had expelled more than 15,000 Indians since 2009, almost half of them between 2019-2024.\n\nIndia is the world’s fifth-largest economy and enjoys world-beating GDP growth, but hundreds of thousands of its citizens still leave the country each year seeking better opportunities abroad.",
