When the DHO tried to persuade them, the suspects started beating up the polio team. The police rushed to the spot and saved the polio workers and the DHO from the mob. However, the attackers also pelted stones at the police mobile and managed to escape, he added.\n\nThe chief secretary took strict notice of the attack on the polio team and instructed the inspector general of police to ensure swift arrests of all those responsible.\n\nHe also ordered an increase in security for polio teams across the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 7th, 2025",
