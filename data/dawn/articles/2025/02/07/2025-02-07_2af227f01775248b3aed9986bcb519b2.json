The Sindh government, the provincial ministers, and the inspector general of police Sindh must take action against the deadly dumpers. Those playing with lives should be brought to justice,” he told a press conference on Thursday.\n\nMayor’s letter to traffic police\n\nKarachi Mayor Barrister Murtaza Wahab wrote a letter to the DIG-traffic and expressed “great concerns” over the growing traffic accidents and called for immediate measures to control the situation.\n\nThe letter also “recommended” specific timings for the movement of heavy traffic.\n\n“It is a source of great concern that a large number of citizens have lost their lives and countless have sustained injuries due to unregulated movement of heavy vehicles (dumpers and trucks) across the city,” the letter stated.\n\n“The present situation is unacceptable and needs intervention of all relevant civic agencies. The mayor, Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC) and the City Council have taken notice of the situation and directed that all possible efforts be made to address the issue,” it said.\n\nThe mayor asked the traffic police to allow heavy vehicles to ply on city roads during late hours, preferably between 8pm and 6am. “Vehicles performing essential and municipal services be allowed to operate during regular hours, but they may be made subject to constant screening by traffic police,” it added.\n\nCity’s deteriorating infrastructure also blamed for accidents\n\nThe opposition parties, however, blamed the Sindh government of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) for the surge in fatal accidents as they argued that the deteriorating road conditions and crumbling infrastructure are just as much to blame for the rising fatalities.\n\nThe opposition also accused the police of failure and focusing more on “bribes” than enforcing traffic laws.\n\nTalking to reporters in Malir at the funeral of a man and his wife who were run over and killed by a dumper truck on Rashid Minhas Road, JI-Karachi chief Monem Zafar questioned the performance of the traffic police and said how come it’s possible that dumpers were roaming in the city during the daytime despite restrictions.\n\nCommenting on the mayor’s letter to the traffic police, he said: “The mayor has written a letter to the police high-ups, but he couldn’t shrug off the responsibility of the prevailing situation from his shoulders by just writing a letter. The PPP is directly responsible for the situation.”\n\n89 citizens killed in traffic accidents in January: MQM-P\n\nAlso on Thursday, provincial lawmakers belonging to the MQM-P criticised the traffic police for its “failure” to control the heavy vehicles that claimed over 80 lives in January alone.\n\n“According to statistics, 89 citizens died in traffic-related accidents in the month of January alone,” they said in a joint statement. “However, the traffic police officers are seen accepting bribes, allowing tankers and trailers to move freely during the daytime.”\n\nThey also blamed the dilapidated condition of the city’s roads for the surge in traffic accidents and demanded an immediate action to address the traffic issue.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 7th, 2025",
