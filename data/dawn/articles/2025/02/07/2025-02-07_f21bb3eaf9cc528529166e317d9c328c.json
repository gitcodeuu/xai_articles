In contrast, deflation occurs when the general price levels decline.\n\n“Rapid disinflation reflects fading base effects from earlier subsidy reforms and exchange rate stability, underpinned by a tight monetary policy stance, which in turn has subdued domestic demand and external financing needs,” Fitch stated.\n\nRegarding economic activity, Fitch highlighted that the activity was now benefitting from stability and falling interest rates, having been subjected to a tight monetary policy settings previously.\n\n“We expect real value added to expand by 3.0 per cent in FY25,” it underlined, adding that “growth in credit to the private sector turned positive in real terms in October 2024 for the first time since June 2022”.\n\nOn positive developments, it highlighted the country’s strong remittance inflows, robust agricultural exports and tight policy settings allowed the current account (CA) to move into a surplus of about $1.2 billion — over 0.5pc of GDP.\n\n“Foreign exchange market reforms in 2023 also facilitated the shift,” it highlighted, adding that when the agency upgraded the country’s rating CCC+, they had expected a “slight widening of the current-account deficit in FY25”.\n\nFurthermore, it estimated that foreign exchange reserves were set to outperform targets under the IMF $7bn Extended Fund Facility and the agency’s previous forecasts.\n\n“Gross official reserves reached over $18.3bn by end-2024, about three months of current external payments, up from around $15.5bn in June,” it added.\n\nPakistan’s external financing needs will remain significant in the coming year, despite progress in rebuilding its foreign exchange reserves, Fitch Ratings said.\n\nPakistan needs to repay over $22bn in external debt in the fiscal year 2025, including nearly $13bn in bilateral deposits, Fitch said.\n\n“Securing sufficient external financing remains a challenge, considering large maturities and lenders existing exposures,” said the credit ratings agency.\n\nLast month, the country agreed on a $1bn loan with two Middle Eastern banks at a 6-7pc interest rate, the finance minister told Reuters in an interview on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum.\n\nWhile the country’s central bank chief earlier said the country aims to raise up to $4bn from Middle Eastern commercial banks by the next fiscal year.\n\nPakistan is undergoing reforms under a $7 billion IMF programme, which is up for its first review later this month. The programme aims to help Pakistan address deep-rooted economic issues such as its large fiscal and current account deficits.\n\n“Deteriorating external liquidity, for example linked to delays in IMF reviews, could lead to negative action,” the rating agency said.",
