Naek, and Pakistan Bar Council representative Akhtar Hussain received 10 to 11 votes from the commission’s 13 members.\n\nThe nominees suggested by PTI’s Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Senator Ali Zafar failed to get any votes.\n\nThe nomination of one of the nominees was approved after the individual submitted a certificate renouncing their UK nationality, the source said.\n\nPBC rejects amendments\n\nSeparately, the executive committee of the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) has rejected the amendments in the Legal Practitioners and Bar Councils Act, 1973, proposed by the Ministry of Law and Justice.\n\nThe committee’s meeting in Peshawar discussed the draft of amendments to sections 5A and 11A to increase the length of practice as a high court advocate.\n\nThe draft recommended that the length of membership for being eligible to contest elections for provincial/Islamabad bar councils be increased from five years to 10 years.\n\nThe total length of practice as an advocate should be increased from 15 years to 20 years.\n\nSimilarly, to contest the election of the Pakistan Bar Council, the term limit for practice as an advocate of the Supreme Court should be raised from 15 to 20 years.\n\nThe length of practice as an advocate of the Supreme Court required to become a PBC member was proposed to be increased from five years to 10 years.\n\nThe committee unanimously opposed and rejected the amendments and said the prevailing length of practice was a “sufficient qualification” to become a member of bar councils.\n\nThere is no need to increase the practice length as it would “deprive” young lawyers of the chance to contest bar elections.\n\nYoung lawyers should be encouraged to contest these elections as they contribute significantly to the legal profession and the bar.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 2nd, 2025",
