  "content": "LAHORE: Former Pakistan captain Babar Azam will play as an opener in the upcoming tri-nation series involving South Africa and New Zealand along with the hosts, Dawn has learnt.\n\nOne of Pakistan’s opening slot was vacated when Saim Ayub fractured his ankle during the second Test against South Africa last month. According to a source close to the selectors, the team doctor had ruled out Saim for two to three months in during the tour only, confirming the left-hander would miss out on the ICC Champions Trophy and the preceding tri-nation series, a warm-up for the eight-team extravaganza.\n\nThe source revealed that the Pakistan team management had shared with Babar the plan of making him the opener — a role he has thrived in the T20 format — for the one-day cricket as well.\n\nWith Saim’s opening partner Abdullah Shafique also dropped from Pakistan’s squad for the tri-nation series and the Champions Trophy, two opening slots are vacant. While one will be taken by Fakhar Zaman, who returns to the national one-day roster for the first time since November 2023, Babar will partner the flamboyant southpaw.\n\nCurrently, the selectors’ decision is to test Babar as opener in the tri-nation series. Whether the right-hander would take the same role in the Champions Trophy is yet to be decided.\n\nPakistan have also called back Test mainstay Saud Shakeel in the 50-over squad, adding to their top-order options. The national side will open their tri-nation series campaign against New Zealand at the Gaddafi Stadium on Feb 8.\n\nThe Mohammad Rizwan-led side will take on South Africa at Karachi’s National Bank Stadium four days later. The tournament’s final is scheduled for Feb 14 in Karachi only.\n\nPakistan’s Champions Trophy will start in the metropolis also against New Zealand on Feb 19 before they travel to Dubai to take on India on Feb 23 before they fly to Rawalpindi for their final group fixture against Bangladesh on Feb 27.\n\nThe Champions Trophy will see Pakistan host an International Cricket Council tournament for the first time since the 1996 World Cup.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 2nd, 2025",
