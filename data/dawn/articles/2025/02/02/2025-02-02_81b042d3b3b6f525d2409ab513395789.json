  "content": "WASHINGTON: Pakistani-Americans staged a protest outside the Pakistani Embassy on Friday, demanding urgent government action to end the humanitarian crisis in Parachinar.\n\nOrganised by United Voice for Parachinar, the protest highlighted the worsening crisis in Kurram, where shortages of food and medical supplies have left residents struggling to survive. The protesters claimed that over 200 children had died due to the lack of medical care.\n\nSpeakers warned that Kurram’s location along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border makes the ongoing violence a national security threat, undermining counterterrorism efforts and straining the already limited resources.\n\nThey criticised successive governments for taking a firefighting approach, arguing that only a Kurram-specific strategy can address the region’s deep-rooted tribal divisions.\n\nPakistani-American women also participated, carrying placards demanding the restoration of normalcy in Parachinar and chanting slogans against government inaction.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 2nd, 2025",
