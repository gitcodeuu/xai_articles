However, he claimed that PTI is now running a campaign against Pakistan that is more damaging than that of India’s intelligence agency RAW.\n\nEarlier, the federal minister attended the first provincial workshop on “Uraan Pakistan” at the CM House.\n\nThe session was attended by CM Shah, Senior Minister Sindh Sharjeel Inam Memon, Provincial Minister for Planning and Development Syed Nasir Hussain Shah, senior federal and provincial bureaucrats, civil society, business community, academia and media persons.\n\nAddressing the gathering, the Sindh CM acknowledged the federal government’s sincerity in economic revival and assured that the province was working diligently on the footsteps of federal government on the 5Es dimension of Uraan Pakistan.\n\nHe acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s sincerity in enabling ports but lamented that the country’s exports were less because Karachi port had a transit time of few hours in the night only. “To boost exports we must equip ourselves with requisite infrastructure and roads,” he emphasised.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
