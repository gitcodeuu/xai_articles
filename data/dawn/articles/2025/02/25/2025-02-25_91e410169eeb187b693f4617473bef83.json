Power Minister Leghari also assured the panel the government would neither discourage solar systems nor impose any tax.\n\nSAPM Muhammad Ali said the government was paying Rs70-80bn to five IPPs whose contracts stood terminated, including Rs30bn to Hub Power Company alone. He dispelled the notion that IPPs were forced to revise contracts through pressure tactics. He said payables to the tune of about Rs300bn on account of late payment surcharge were being waived through the negotiation process, including Rs100bn already written off.\n\nForensic audit\n\nResponding to a question from Senator Shibli Faraz as to why forensic audits were not performed as billions and trillions were paid to IPPs in the past, Mr Ali said Pakistan did not have the expertise to conduct forensic audit of 50-60 plants and required a lot of money.\n\nHe said his committee had sought Rs22 million in 2020 for such an audit, but could not get even a rupee. However, now the audit would be conducted of the IPP not agreeing to discussions for tariff revision, he said, adding that an IPP that did not come to the negotiating table was being examined forensically.\n\nResponding to another question, he agreed that IPPs had secured undue payments from the government by misleading it in fuel and efficiency standards, but it was very difficult to establish over-invoicing allegations without solid evidence and such an attempt could backfire and sponsors could go to international arbitration.\n\nTherefore, he said the task force on IPPs was addressing the matter through negotiations as it had examined the balance sheets of these plants for 20 years.\n\nPower Minister Leghari said the previous government did not implement the Muhammad Ali report on IPPs, adding that the present government had already secured over Rs1.4tr from IPPs without any discretion or favour.\n\nSenator Mohsin Aziz appreciated the performance of the task force on IPPs but wondered when these savings would benefit the consumers. Muhammad Ali said it would gradually reach consumers as negotiations progress and contracts come into force. Mr Leghari chipped in by saying that electricity rates had already dropped by Rs4.11 per unit since June 2024 and more substantial tariff reductions were expected.\n\nThe meeting was told that the government had fixed the return of 17pc for power plants against the unprecedented return of 35pc in the last decades. SAPM Muhammad Ali stated that the government recovered Rs35bn from the power plants which had been paid by the federal government in lieu of fuel. Additionally, the government has initiated negotiations on 45 renewable plants to reduce the profit margin on the said plants at sustainable rates.\n\nWhile discussing the circular debt of the power sector, the SAPM underscored that the government was negotiating to relinquish the interest on circular debt and formulate a structure for the payment of stock circular debt in the coming five to seven years.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
