Those resolutions have failed to stop the war,” Acting US Ambassador Dorothy Shea said before the vote. “What we need is a resolution, marking the commitment from all UN member states to bring a durable end to the war.”\n\nThe amended US-drafted resolution won 93 votes in favour, while 73 states abstained and eight voted no.\n\nThe US put forward its text on Friday, pitting it against Ukraine and European allies who spent the past month negotiating with their own resolution. The General Assembly also adopted the resolution drafted by Ukraine and European countries on Monday with 93 votes in favour, 65 abstentions and 18 no votes.\n\nEuropean leaders in Ukraine\n\nUkraine hosted European leaders on Monday to mark three years of all-out war with Russia, while top US officials stayed away in a clear illustration of President Trump’s lurch towards Moscow since returning to power.\n\nStill reeling from Trump denouncing the Ukrainian president as a “dictator” and accusing him of starting the war, Volodymyr Zelensky, who has told Europe to create its own army while urging Wash­ington to be pragmatic, welcomed a slew of European and other leaders to a summit in Kyiv to commemorate the start in 2022 of the biggest conflict in Europe since World War Two.\n\nThe visitors included Euro­pean Commission President Urs­ula von der Leyen, Euro­pean Council President Ant­onio Costa and the leaders of Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Lat­via, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Spain and Sweden.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
