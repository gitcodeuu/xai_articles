  "content": "JOHANNESBURG: In a bid to keep the shine on struggling natural diamond sales, industry giant De Beers has launched a verification device to differentiate natural gems from their laboratory-grown competitors, the company announced on Monday.\n\nThe “DiamondProof” device is meant to confirm authenticity of precious stones “formed deep within the Earth billions of years ago”, De Beers said in a press release, at a time when the industry faces strong competition and plummeting prices.\n\nA black scanner-like machine available at retailers in the US, it detects “the distinct chemical compositions of natural diamonds”, De Beers said. “The natural diamond industry is in a constant effort to create separation from lab-grown” gems, which are cheaper and only take a few weeks to be produced, diamond industry analyst Edahn Golan said.\n\nThe launch “is part of a wider effort in the diamond industry to pull itself by the bootstraps” through marketing, pricing and consumer education, Golan said. Diamond sales have struggled to recover since the Covid-19 pandemic, facing a downturn in consumer spending, particularly in China.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
