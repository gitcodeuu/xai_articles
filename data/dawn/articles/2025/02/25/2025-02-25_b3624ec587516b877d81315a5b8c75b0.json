  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Lal Masjid students on Monday continued their sit-in at Aabpara Chowk against the arrest of Ume Hassan, wife Maulana Abdul Aziz, and others, inconveniencing the residents of the area and motorists.\n\nOver 60 protesters, majority of them women and girls, daily emerge at Aabpara Chowk in the morning and stage sit-in till sunset. During the protest they chant slogans, demanding the release of Ume Hassan and others arrested by Shahzad Town police in connection with a case registered against them over an attack at police, CDA staff and labourers during construction of a religious seminary in the area of Margalla Town on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the protest the traffic remained suspended in and around the two spots of Khayaban-i-Suharwardy Road and Srinagar Highway.\n\nThe police have made traffic diversions to avoid inconvenience to motorists, but the diversions caused traffic congestionon adjacent and nearby roads.\n\nMeanwhile, the Anti-Terrorist Court (ATC) of Islamabad Judge Abual Hasnat Mohammad Zulqarnainon Monday handed over Ume Hassan and other accused to police for another three days.\n\nThey were arrested on charges of interfering in government affairs besides allegedly intimidating the CDA officials.\n\nDuring the hearing, the police presented Ume Hassan and others before the court following the expiry of their initial four-day physical remand. The prosecution requested an extension, arguing that further recovery of evidence was required and additional arrests needed to be made.\n\nHowever, the defense counsel opposed the plea, asserting that the police had already completed a four-day remand, and had recovered necessary evidence, and further investigation was unjustified.\n\nThe defense also demanded the release of those not named in the FIR.\n\nThe defense further claimed that Ume Hassan was blindfolded and arrested while engaging in negotiations with the management to avert the demolition of a mosque.\n\nAfter reserving the decision on the remand request, the court later extended the physical remand of all accused for an additional three days and handed over the accused to the police for further investigation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
