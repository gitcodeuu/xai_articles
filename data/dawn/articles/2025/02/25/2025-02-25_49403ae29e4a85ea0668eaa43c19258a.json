As a result, Ashraf and Naveed died on the spot, while Usman, suffered serious injuries in the accident.\n\nRescue teams rushed to the spot and retrieved the bodies and injured person. The dead and wounded were shifted to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi.\n\nThe errant driver managed to escape from the spot, leaving behind the heavy vehicle that was impounded by the Docks police.\n\nThe officials said the rickshaw driver and one woman travelling on the motorbike were also injured in the accident.\n\nThe DIG said that Mr Adamani was an industrialist, who had a plastic industry, Ashraf Enterprises, in the SITE area.\n\nRegarding the movement of heavy vehicles during the daytime, the DIG claimed that trailers transport cargo from the port area to nearby yards and warehouses, and do not enter city areas during the day.\n\nHe said the police were waiting for the victims’ family to lodge an FIR.\n\n‘Karachiites lives not disposable’\n\nIn a hard-hitting statement, SITE Association of Industry President Ahmed Azeem Alvi condemned the Sindh government for leaving Karachi’s business community and citizens at the mercy of dangerous trailers, asserting that urgent action must be taken.\n\n“The lives of Karachi’s people are not disposable. The government must take decisive steps to prevent further tragedies caused by reckless trailers,” he said in a statement issued on Monday evening.\n\nIt said that the tragic incident has sparked outrage among the business community and raised concerns over the unchecked movement of heavy vehicles in the city.\n\nExpressing deep grief over the unfortunate deaths, the association’s president lamented the recurring dangers posed by these heavy transport vehicles and called for urgent reforms to regulate their movement.\n\n“Governor Kamran Tessori and Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah have been urged to take immediate action against the growing menace of trailers speeding through the city. These vehicles pose a continuous threat to Karachi residents and authorities must enforce strict controls, including banning trailers from entering urban areas during peak hours,” he said.\n\nMr Alvi called upon law enforcement agencies to actively address this issue and ensure that Karachi’s roads are safe for commuters.\n\nHe demanded an emergency meeting with government officials to devise a plan for controlling reckless trailers and preventing further loss of life.\n\nHe criticised authorities for their lack of enforcement, stating that unregulated trailer activity contributed to severe accidents and endangers countless lives. “If these violations persist, Karachi could face a significant law-and-order crisis,” he warned.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
