The five also included one Chinese citizen.\n\n“They were working to install a deck on the bridge,” Ko told a televised briefing. “All of the 10 were up on the deck … and fell from both sides when it collapsed.”\n\nBroadcaster YTN aired dramatic footage showing a deck of a towering bridge collapsing at the site.\n\nRescue workers at the site were seen examining twisted metal struts and fractured concrete slabs below the columns of the highway bridge.\n\nActing President Choi Sang-mok called to mobilise all available personnel and resources to rescue any missing people and to ensure safety measures to prevent further damage, his office said.\n\nThe National Fire Agency said that it has mobilised three helicopters and nearly 150 officials for the search and rescue operation, and the Transport Ministry said it has dispatched a team of officials to the scene.\n\nDeadly accidents continue to regularly occur at industrial sites in South Korea, which introduced a law in 2022 to address safety lapses and punish company management if a worker is killed on the job.\n\nEarlier in February, six people died in a fire in a hotel construction site in the port city of Busan, with around 100 people evacuated including 14 workers plucked to safety by a helicopter after they had taken refuge on a rooftop.\n\nIn June last year, a fire at a lithium battery factory that authorities blamed on quality control failures and inadequate safety training killed 23 workers.\n\nData released in March by South Korea’s labour ministry showed that 598 industrial workers died in 2023, with the construction sector accounting for nearly half, or 303, though the total death toll was down from 644 in 2022.",
