  "content": "Bangladesh and Pakistan have started direct government-to-government trade after decades of troubled relations with imports of 50,000 tonnes of rice, Dhaka said on Tuesday.\n\nThe two countries have witnessed a thaw in ties after the ouster of India-aligned premier Sheikh Hasina.\n\nLong-time Bangladeshi prime minister Sheikh Hasina was ousted in an August 2024 revolution, fleeing by helicopter to her old ally India, where she has defied extradition requests to face charges of crimes against humanity.\n\nRelations between India and Bangladesh’s new government have been frosty since then, allowing Islamabad and Dhaka to slowly rebuild ties.\n\nDirect private trade between the countries restarted in November 2024, when a container ship sailed from Pakistan’s Karachi to Bangladesh’s Chittagong.\n\nIt was the first cargo ship in decades to sail directly between the countries.\n\n“For the first time we are importing 50,000 tons of rice from Pakistan, and it is the first government-to-government deal between the two countries,” Ziauddin Ahmed, a senior official at the food ministry in Dhaka, said on Tuesday.\n\nBangladesh’s Directorate General of Food signed a memorandum of understanding with the state-owned Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) in January for rice imports.\n\nAhmed said trade with Pakistan offers a “new avenue of sourcing and competitive pricing”, with state authorities in recent years importing the staple from India, Thailand and Vietnam.\n\nImports are critical to low-lying Bangladesh, a nation that is among the world’s most vulnerable to climate change, with large areas made up of deltas where the Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers wind towards the sea.\n\nThe country of 170 million is particularly at risk of devastating floods and cyclones — disasters that only stand to accelerate as the planet keeps warming.\n\nPrivate Bangladeshi companies have imported Pakistani rice for years, but Pakistani goods previously had to be off-loaded onto feeder vessels — usually in Sri Lanka, Malaysia or Singapore — before travelling on.",
