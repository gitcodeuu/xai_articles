  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The court of Judicial Magistrate of Secretariat Shahzad Khan has initiated proceedings against Chairman Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT), Dr Tahirul Qadri, in connection with the 2014 sit-in case and has issued arrest warrants for MNA Khurram Shahzad, Allama Raja Nasir Abbas, and other absent accused.\n\nDuring the hearing, the court took notice of Dr Tahirul Qadri’s continued absence despite summons and began proceedings to declare him an absconder.\n\nMeanwhile, the PTI founder and former prime minister, Imran Khan, on a permanent exemption from appearance in related cases, led to the court adjourning further hearings until May 5. Two cases have been registered against Mr Khan and others at the Secretariat Police Station. PTI and PAT had jointly started a sit-in at Islamabad back in August 2014.\n\nPAT announced an end to his party’s protest demonstration in the federal capital in October, whereas PTI’s protest continued untill December of the same year. In mid-August 2014, when these protests began, it was widely believed among the demonstrators that the then-prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, would be removed within days – either through resignation or via military takeover.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
