He had suggested engaging the protesters’ representatives in talks with the federal committee to sort out the issues. However, the protesters refused and continued the sit-in.\n\nAfter failure of the federal minister, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan, Agriculture Minister Engineer Mohammad Anwar, Rehmat Khaliq and Shah Baig, who also support the demands, held negotiations with the protesters to convince them to end the sit-in. However, their efforts also failed in the three rounds of talks held in Chilas.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Maulana Hazratullah, the head of the protest movement committee, said people of the region staged the sit-in despite the cold weather for the last nine days.\n\n“On demand of the protesters, a federal committee was constituted to settle the issues; however, the committee’s head (Amir Muqam) says he has no powers to settle our issues and other members of the committee were not presented there, so the protesters boycotted the talks.”\n\nHe said the GB chief minister also suggested initiating talks with the cabinet and sought time to settle the issues.\n\nHowever, the protesters said the sit-in would be called off after assurance and an agreement to settle all their 31 demands.\n\nHe said Wapda and other relevant authorities were not serious to settle the issues.\n\nMaulana Hazratullah said the protest will be intensified and plan B will be announced soon.\n\nHe called people from other areas to join them to continue the protest movement.\n\nMeanwhile, people from other areas of the region continued to join the protest sit-in to show solidarity with the protesters.\n\nThe 31 points charter of demands included 80 per cent royalty of Diamer Dam and 30pc royalty of Dassu Dam for Gilgit-Baltistan; free electricity to Diamer district and on discounted rate to the people of GB from Diamer Dam, compensation for 18,000 acres acquired for the dam, financial package for the remaining 3,000 families of affected by the dam, commercial and residential plots, education, health, sewerage projects, appointments of local people on the dam project from grade 1 to grade 16 and regularisation of contingent and daily wage employees.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 25th, 2025",
