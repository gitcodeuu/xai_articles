They believe they can get away with anything,” he said at an army memorial event.\n\nBangladesh has been riven by a surge of crime, as well as protests this month where crowds smashed buildings connected to Hasina’s family.\n\nLast week, rival student factions clashed at a university campus, a sign of serious discord between groups instrumental in driving the uprising against Hasina.\n\nSecurity forces have arrested more than 8,600 people since it launched “Operation Devil Hunt” on February 8, which the government has accused of being Hasina loyalists and of wanting to “destabilise” the country.\n\n“The anarchy we have witnessed is manufactured by us,” Zaman said.\n\nBangladesh has a long history of military coups.\n\nWhile it was Zaman who took charge after Hasina fled by helicopter to India on August 5, he had also urged the people to back Nobel Prize-winning microfinance pioneer Muhammad Yunus.\n\nYunus, 84, vows to institute far-reaching democratic reforms and hold general elections in late 2025 or in early 2026, and Waker had sworn in the interim government.\n\n“At the beginning, I said it would take 18 months to hold an election,” Zaman said. “We are on that path. Professor Yunus is doing his best to keep us united. Let’s help him.”\n\nKey student protest leader Nahid Islam resigned on Tuesday from the government cabinet — where he headed the telecoms ministry — ahead of the expected launch of a new political party on Friday.\n\nYunus has said he inherited a “completely broken down” system of public administration and justice that needs a comprehensive overhaul to prevent a future return to autocracy.\n\nThe army chief said security forces accused of a raft of allegations “of enforced disappearances, murder and torture must be investigated”.\n\n“Punishment must be ensured,” he said. “Otherwise, we will be trapped in the same cycle.” The armed forces were granted judicial powers like the police — including making arrests — after the revolution.\n\nBut Zaman, a career infantry officer who has spent nearly four decades in the military, serving two tours as a UN peacekeeper, said he just wanted a break.\n\n“I just want to bring the country and the nation to a stable point and then take a vacation,” he said.\n\n“After that, we will return to our barracks. “",
