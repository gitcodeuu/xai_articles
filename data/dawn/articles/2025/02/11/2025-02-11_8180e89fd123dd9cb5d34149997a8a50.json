  "content": "SAHIWAL: Pakpattan Police successfully recovered Aslam Murad, a resident of Malka Hans, from Kandh Kot, district Kashmore, Sindh, four months after his kidnap through a honey trap.\n\nAslam was abducted by the gangs of Katcha area and his kidnappers demanded Rs10m ransom for his release.\n\nAslam worked in Lahore to earn his livelihood. He had established contact with a woman through his mobile phone and she invited him to meet her in Sukkur.\n\nIn the last week of September, Aslam informed his elder brother, Muhammad Ikram, that he was going to Sukkur for business. Aslam left on a bus on Sept 10 and remained in contact with his family for two days before his phone went off.\n\nHis video appeal in chains to his three brothers and friends went viral on social media platforms three months back.\n\nMalka Hans Police Station SHO Afzal Jatoi was approached by family. A police team, led by Pakpattan SDPO Inamul Haq was formed to investigate the case.\n\nMeanwhile, the kidnappers approached family members and demanded Rs50m for Aslam’s release. They later reduced the amount to Rs10m. However, Muhammad Ikram’s family, belonging to the agricultural labour class could not meet the demand.\n\nOn police directions, the family began negotiations while police contacted the DPO Rahim Yar Khan, local notables as well as the police in Kandh Kot, Kashmore.\n\nDistrict Police Officer Javed Iqbal claimed that continuous negotiations led to Aslam’s recovery without paying the ransom. Ikram told Dawn that his brother was brought home by police safely.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
