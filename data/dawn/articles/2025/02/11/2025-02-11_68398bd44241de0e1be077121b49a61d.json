Previously, lawmakers received a monthly salary of Rs180,000.\n\nThe bill — passed by the NA today — was tabled by Romina Khurshid Alam. Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar did not oppose the proposed legislation, according to the Associated Press of Pakistan.\n\nThe bill, which seeks to amend the Members of Parliament (Salaries and Allowances) Act, 1974 [The Members of Parliament (Salaries and Allowances) (Amendment) Bill, 2025] has already been passed by the Senate.\n\nIn December, Punjab Assembly also passed an amendment bill making a hefty increase in financial perks and privileges of elected members, the speaker, deputy speaker, ministers, parliamentary secretaries, special assistants and advisers.",
