Otherwise, the dam’s construction will be stopped, the protesters warned.\n\nThe protesters claimed that Wapda had acquired 18,000 acres of land without paying compensation to local owners.\n\nProtesters accuse Wapda of not employing locals at construction site\n\nThey claimed that land owned by locals was declared state property for the dam’s construction.\n\nThe Wapda “didn’t pay adequate compensation” to land owners and demanded immediate reparation.\n\nAccording to the protesters, Wapda didn’t fulfil its commitment to provide jobs to locals at the Diamer Bhasha Dam site.\n\nInitially, Wapda had to appoint local people to posts from grade 1 to grade 16. However, the decision was “not implemented”.\n\nThe protesters demanded jobs for locals at the dam site and said local contractual employees of Wapda should be made permanent immediately.\n\nAccording to the protesters, the government had announced a compensation of Rs4.7 million for each of the over 4,200 affected families, while Wapda had promised six kanal land for each family who would displaced after the dam’s construction.\n\nThey claimed that over 2,000 affected were still awaiting the payment under the package.\n\nThey demanded compensation at today’s market rate and the immediate allotment of “promised land”.\n\nThey said over 4,000 families in Diamer have “sacrificed their everything: lands, homes, agriculture” for the future of Pakistan.\n\nThe protesters said other financial programmes for the rehabilitation of displaced people have not been implemented.\n\nA large number of activists from PPP, PML-N, PTI, JUI-F, regional organisations and youth groups attended the demonstration on Monday.\n\nThe protesters chanted slogans such as “Give Rights, Build the Dam” during the demonstration led by religious scholars of Diamer.\n\nGB assembly member from Diamer, Shah Baig, who is also the region’s forest minister, and Muhammad Anwar, the agriculture minister, also joined the demonstration and expressed solidarity with the protesters.\n\nAddressing the protest, Mr Anwar, who was elected from Chilas, said the Diamer Bhasha Dam was a mega project.\n\nHe said the locals’ demands were genuine and that his government would “stand with the people”.\n\nMr Baig vowed to go to every extent against Wapda. “We will never compromise on the rights of local people.”\n\nThey vowed to continue their struggle until the demands were met, emphasising that their children’s future was linked to this issue.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
