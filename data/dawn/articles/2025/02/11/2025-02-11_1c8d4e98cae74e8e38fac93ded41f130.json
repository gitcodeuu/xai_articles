I have instructed the IDF (military) to prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza,” Katz said in a statement.\n\nThe office of Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement that all the families of the prisoners were infor­med of Hamas’ announcement. “The families were made aware that the State of Israel is committed to respecting the agreement and considers any violation of it with the utmost seriousness.”\n\nUnder the terms of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel, the first phase of which came into effect on January 19, 33 Israelis were to be released in exchange for around 1,900 prisoners.\n\nOn Saturday, they completed their fifth prisoner exchange, with three Israelis and 183 Palestinian prisoners released.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
