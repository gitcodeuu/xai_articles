That deprived those students who are permanent residents of the city’s seven districts.\n\nThe issue came to light when senior officials of the Liaquat University of Medical & Health Sciences, which is responsible for finalising the merit list of Sindh medical colleges, randomly searched the computerised national identity card (CNIC) numbers of some students and found that they already possessed the domicile of Punjab but got admission into medical colleges in Sindh on the basis of Karachi domicile.\n\nAs the opposition held the Sindh government responsible and demanded the apex court to take suo motu notice, a senior Pakistan Peoples Party leader, who also represents the Sindh government as the head of the powerful Chief Minister’s Inspection Committee (CMIT), shrugged off the allegations and announced an inquiry.\n\n“We will definitely hold an inquiry and seek details from all relevant offices and institutions,” Special Assistant to Chief Minister (SACM) Senator Waqar Mehdi told Dawn. “It’s a very serious allegation and one must fix it if there’s any wrongdoing involved.”\n\nHe said that the CM team would look into the alleged reports. The team, he said, would gather every piece of evidence, physically visit the places under question and look into every possible angle that helps connecting the dots.\n\n“Usually we try to complete the job within couple of weeks but sometimes the response from the institutions concerned and relevant details take time to emerge. Whatever it takes, we would try our best to reach the logical end,” added Senator Mehdi.\n\nMuttahida condemns ‘injustice to Karachi students’\n\nThe situation drew strong reaction from the opposition MQM-P which appealed to the chief justice of Pakistan to take a suo motu action on the allegations “to provide justice to the students of Karachi.”\n\n“Once again, open injustice is being done to the students of Karachi,” the party said in a statement. “The plan to give the reserved quota for Karachi students in medical colleges to interior Sindh has been successfully executed. Fake domiciles are being created to legalise illegal acts. In universities across the country, students from the local district and city are given admission on a preferential basis.”\n\nIt said that Karachi has become the only city where non-local students are being admitted on a preferential basis but “corrupt and feudal mindset of the PPP government” is defying all set rules and regulations.\n\n“The MQM-Pakistan demands that the chief justice of Pakistan take suo motu action to provide justice to the students of Karachi,” it added.\n\nThe reports said that a significant number of fake domicile certificates in Karachi were issued from the city’s East district, with many students having completed their matriculation and intermediate from other cities. It said that some students initially held Punjab domicile certificates, only to later exchange them for Sindh certificates.\n\nIt says that online domicile verification system in Punjab has made it easier to identify these fraudulent documents, whereas Sindh’s manual system has created challenges in verifying the legitimacy of dual certificates.\n\nAs a result, students from other provinces and federal areas have gained admission to medical colleges in Karachi, while local students are being denied entry due to the provincial government’s stringent domicile policy, said the report.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
