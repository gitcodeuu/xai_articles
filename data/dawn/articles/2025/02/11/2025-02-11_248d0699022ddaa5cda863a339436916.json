Seven members voted in favour of appointing Justice Farooq as a Supreme Court judge, while Justice Mandokhail and JCP member Akhtar Hussain dissented.\n\nAt the outset of the proceedings, Justice Shah and Justice Akhtar referred to a letter written by four judges of the Supreme Court, requesting the CJP to postpone the meeting till a decision on the 26th Amendment and the seniority of the IHC judges. But the JCP, by a majority vote, proceeded with the meeting, prompting the two judges to walk out.\n\nPTI representatives Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and Barrister Ali Zafar also asked the commission to put the meeting on hold until the matter of the IHC judges’ seniority was finally determined, adding that if the commission chose to proceed, then it should not at least consider any of the judges recently transferred to the IHC as eligible for appointments.\n\nHowever, JCP members asked the PTI leaders to raise their point when the matter of the IHC judges’ elevation came before the commission.\n\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail also asked to stay, but to no avail.\n\nAfter the meeting, Barrister Zafar told Dawn that the party had given them clear instructions not to participate in the meeting if the JCP did not heed their request. Barrister Gohar Ali Khan told reporters that the PTI representatives supported the point of view of the two judges but chose not to participate any further when their stance was not taken up.\n\nDuring the meeting, CJP Afridi suggested the elevation of Justice Mian­gul Hassan Aura­ngzeb under Article 181 of the Constitution to clear tax and commercial matters pending in the top court.\n\nArticle 181 allows the president to appoint a high court judge qualified for appointment as a judge of the Supreme Court to act temporarily as judge of the apex court.\n\nJustice Aurangzeb will remain a judge of the Supreme Court until the pleasure of the president, after which Justice Aurangzeb may revert back to the IHC or stand confirmed as a judge of the Supreme Court depending on the situation.\n\nThe decision was made against the backdrop of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif as well as the Federal Board of Revenue’s request for expeditious disposal of pending tax/revenue matters, since the stuck-up cases were causing huge revenue losses to the national exchequer.\n\nLawyers protest\n\nMeanwhile, the All-Pakistan Lawyers Action Committee held a protest, with a request to the CJP and the JCP members to protect, preserve and uphold judicial independence.\n\nDue to the lawyers’ protest, all entry routes to the Red Zone were closed off. Dozens of lawyers gathered at Serena Chowk as the route to Nadra Chowk was blocked.\n\nThe protest urged the commission to stand firm against any pressures, political manoeuvring or unconstitutional actions that sought to erode the integrity of the courts, saying it was now time for the entire judiciary to unite and reclaim its rightful place as the guardian of justice, constitutional supremacy, and the fundamental rights of the people.\n\nOn the other hand, the Pakistan Bar Council, the Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan, the Punjab Bar Council, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Bar Council, the Balo­chistan High Court Bar Association and the Sindh High Court Bar Asso­ciation distanced themselves from the strike call.\n\nThey regretted that certain political factions within the legal community were attempting to create chaos and division to achieve their ulterior political motives and realise their questionable political agendas.\n\nMeanwhile, the seven-judge Constitutional Bench did not hold its hea­ring in the military court case as senior counsel Salman Akram Raja could not reach the Supreme Court.\n\nThe hearing will be taken up on Tuesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
