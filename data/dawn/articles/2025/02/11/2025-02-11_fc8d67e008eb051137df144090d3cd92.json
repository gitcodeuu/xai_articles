He lauded the late Aga Khan’s contributions to Pakistan’s social and economic development, particularly in health care, education, community development, and poverty alleviation.\n\nCounter-terrorism dialogue\n\nSeparately, Pakistan and Turkiye agreed to strengthen cooperation in countering terrorism financing, preventing radicalisation, and curbing the misuse of the internet for terrorism, the Foreign Office said.\n\nThe understanding was reached during the second round of Pakistan-Turkiye Counter-Terrorism Consultations, held in Islamabad after a six-year hiatus despite robust counter-terrorism cooperation between the two countries.\n\n“It was agreed to further strengthen the bilateral cooperation in areas of the countering financing of terrorism, preventing the use of internet for terrorist purposes and the prevention of radicalisation,” the FO said.\n\nBoth sides reviewed the global and regional terrorism landscape and exchanged views on threats posed by terrorist entities.\n\nThe FO said the delegations shared best practices and reaffirmed their commitment to deepening collaboration.\n\n“The international community needs to address the root causes of terrorism by resolving long-protracted conflicts,” the FO statement said, adding that both countries would continue their mutual learning and cooperation in countering terrorism.\n\nPakistan and Turkiye have maintained a deep-rooted strategic partnership, with counter-terrorism cooperation forming a key pillar alongside trade and defence ties.\n\nThe first round of counter-terrorism consultations was held in Ankara in May 2019, where both sides explored avenues for cooperation, including law enforcement, criminal justice, countering terrorism financing, and preventing radicalization.\n\nBoth countries are acutely aware of the threat of terrorism, with Pakistan facing insurgency in Balochistan as well as Taliban militancy, and Turkiye confronting the Kurdish separatist movement.\n\nPakistan and Turkiye conduct joint military exercises, codenamed “Ataturk,” focusing on counter-terrorism. These drills involve special forces from both countries, covering urban and rural combat scenarios, hostage rescues, and handling improvised explosive devices.\n\nIntelligence sharing also forms a critical component of bilateral counter-terrorism efforts, with both countries exchanging data on terrorist networks, movements, and financing to pre-empt threats.\n\nErdogan to visit Pakistan\n\nPresident Erdogan will also visit Pakistan later this week as part of a three-nation Asia tour to boost ties with Malaysia, Indonesia and Pakistan, according to Turkish news outlet Daily Sabah.\n\nErdogan will begin his four-day trip today in Malaysia before heading to Indonesia and concluding the tour in Pakistan, Dawn.com reported.\n\nHis meetings will “focus on enhancing cooperation in various fields, as well as hot topics on the international agenda, from the Palestine-Israel conflict to the situation in Syria … as well as the Russia-Ukraine conflict,” the Daily Sabah said.\n\n“Erdogan’s last stopover will be Pakistan, whose relations with Turkiye reached the highest level under successive tenures of the Turkish president,” the daily reported.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
