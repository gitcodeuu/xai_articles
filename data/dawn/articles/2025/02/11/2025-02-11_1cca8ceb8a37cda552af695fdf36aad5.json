The FAA is temporarily pausing flights into the airport.”\n\nDave Folio, of the Scottsdale Fire Department, said units were on the runway trying to free one person.\n\n“I can tell you that we have five souls, one dead on arrival at hospital, two immediate that have been transported to local trauma centers,” he told a press conference.\n\nOne other person whose condition he described as stable was also taken to the hospital.\n\nThe crash was the latest in a series of aviation tragedies that have rocked the United States.\n\nOn January 30, a passenger jet collided in midair with a US Army helicopter in Washington, killing all 67 people aboard both aircraft.\n\nThe disaster was followed rapidly by the crash of a medical plane into a busy Philadelphia neighborhood, killing seven and injuring 19.\n\nLast week a small plane with 10 people on board crashed as it flew between two remote settlements in Alaska. There were no survivors.",
