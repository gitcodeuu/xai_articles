  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad High Court (IHC) summoned the Federal Public Service Commission (FPSC) chairman on Monday in response to a petition challenging the commission’s decision to conduct new Central Superior Services (CSS) exams before announcing the results of the previous one held last year.\n\nJustice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani presided over the hearing on Monday, where petitioner Hamza Javed and several other candidates appeared alongside their legal counsel, Advocate Ali Raza.\n\nThe petitioners argued that the FPSC proceeded with issuing admission certificates on February 4 without considering their objections, despite the matter being under judicial review.\n\nAdvocate Ali Raza informed the court that the FPSC had issued a duty roster on February 3 and announced its decision to hold new examinations, disregarding the concerns of thousands of affected candidates.\n\nThe petitioners contend that this decision has placed them at a disadvantage, as the CSS 2024 results remain pending.\n\nDuring the proceedings, Justice Kayani initially remarked that he would refer the matter back to the commission for reconsideration.\n\nHowever, given the petitioners’ concerns, the court has now summoned the FPSC chairman to appear at 10:30am on Tuesday (today).\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
