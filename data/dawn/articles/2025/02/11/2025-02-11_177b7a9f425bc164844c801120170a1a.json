The identities of only 13 Pakistanis killed in the incident were confirmed, while 22 survived the tragedy.\n\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa Gov­ernor Faisal Karim Kundi contacted the Pakis­tani embassy on Monday following reports of the accident, APP reported.\n\nHe expressed deep sorrow over the incident and direc­ted his staff to coordinate with the embassy for assistance.\n\nKundi expressed deep sorrow over the incident, which has claimed the lives of 65 passengers, many of whom are reportedly Pakistani citizens.\n\nMigrants bodies\n\nMeanwhile, the United Nat­ions’ International Orga­n­i­sation for Migration (IOM) on Monday said it was “deeply alarmed” by the dozens of migrant bodies found in mass graves in southeastern Libya, AFP reported.\n\nOn Sunday, Libyan authorities said they found the bodies of 28 sub-Saharan migrants in the southeastern district of Kufra, near a site where they were allegedly detained and tortured.\n\nThe UN agency expressed “shock and concern at the discovery of two mass graves in Libya containing the bodies of dozens of migrants, some with gunshot wounds”.\n\nThe IOM said “at least 30” bodies were found in a mass grave in Kufra, whereas “as many as 70” others may have been buried there.\n\nThe statement also said 19 bodies were discovered in Jakharrah, some 400 kilometres south of the coastal city of Benghazi, though it did not say when.\n\nThe circumstances of the migrants’ “death and nationalities” remain unknown, it said.\n\nThe graves were “discovered following a police raid, during which hundreds of migrants were rescued from traffickers”, it added.\n\nPhotos posted by Libyan authorities Sunday on social media showed emaciated migrants with scars on their faces, limbs and backs.\n\nThe authorities had said three people were arrested, “one Libyan and two foreigners”.\n\nWith input from AFP\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
