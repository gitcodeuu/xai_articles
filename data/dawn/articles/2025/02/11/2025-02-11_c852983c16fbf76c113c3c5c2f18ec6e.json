However, a more structured roadmap and long-term policies were needed to accelerate this transformation.\n\nHe suggested that the initiatives needed to promote the IT sector to an advanced level include talent development, and the SAP offers training programmes, partners with universities, and provides global exposure to students through intern­­ships in Silicon Valley.\n\n“We need more industry-academia collaboration to ensure that graduates are equipped with skills aligned with market demands,” he said, adding that emerging technologies like AI, blockchain, and IoT were shaping global markets.\n\nMr Ahmed highlighted the challenges in implementing IT and ITeS solutions at the government and public sector levels, including resistance to change, outdated infrastructure, and a lack of skilled IT professionals within government bodies.\n\nHe added that to address these challenges, the government has to invest in digital literacy, improved regulatory frameworks, and further stronger public-private partnerships drives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 11th, 2025",
