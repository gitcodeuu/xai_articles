Then we heard more shooting in the hallway. We didn’t go out, we hid in our offices,” they said.\n\n“There were a lot of gunshots at first and then it was quiet for a half-hour and then it started again. We were lying under our desks, cowering.”\n\nSome witnesses told Swedish media they heard what they believed to be automatic gunfire.\n\nPolice said they believe the gunman acted alone.\n\nSwedish television channel TV4 reported that police had raided the suspect’s home in Orebro late on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIt said the suspect was around 35 years old and had a licence to carry a weapon and no criminal record, but did not provide any details about his identity.\n\nPolice have not confirmed that information.\n\nPolice said they were investigating “attempted murder, arson and an aggravated weapons offence”.\n\nThey urged members of the public to stay away from the area or keep inside their homes.\n\nStudents in several nearby schools as well as the one in question had been locked in for several hours “for safety reasons” before gradually being released, police said.\n\n“It is a very painful day for all of Sweden,” Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson wrote on X.\n\n“My thoughts are also with all those whose normal school day was replaced with horror. Being confined to a classroom fearing for your own life is a nightmare that no one should have to experience.”\n\nHe said the government was “closely monitoring developments”.\n\nA mother whose son was kept indoors at his nearby school for several hours during the police operation told AFP she was “shocked” and “angry”.\n\n“My son is at this school behind us, they’re locked in too. They have to hide, so I’m waiting for them to evacuate,” Cia Sandell, 42, said.\n\n“This is crazy, totally crazy. I’m angry, I’m shocked. This shouldn’t happen,” she said.\n\nThough such shootings are rare, several other violent incidents have struck Swedish schools in recent years.\n\nIn March 2022, an 18-year-old student stabbed two teachers to death at a secondary school in the southern city of Malmo.\n\nTwo months earlier, a 16-year-old was arrested after wounding another student and a teacher with a knife at a school in the small town of Kristianstad.\n\nIn October 2015, three people were killed in a racially motivated attack at a school in the western town of Trollhattan by a sword-wielding assailant who was later killed by police.",
