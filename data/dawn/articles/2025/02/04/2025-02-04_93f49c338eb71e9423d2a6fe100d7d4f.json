Exports also increased by 30.25pc 581,691 tonnes from 446,595 tonnes in January 2024.\n\n“Cement being an essential commodity and not a luxury item, the government should rationalise its tax structure, as the lower cost to the end consumers will boost construction activities and employment in the sector,” said a spokesman for APCMA.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 4th, 2025",
