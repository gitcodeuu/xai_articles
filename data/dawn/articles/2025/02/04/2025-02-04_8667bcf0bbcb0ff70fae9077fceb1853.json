Small companies will be subject to a 20pc tax rate on their annual agricultural income, while large companies will face a tax rate of 29pc.\n\nNotably, livestock has not been included in the tax net, and the advance agricultural income tax, based on land cultivation, will no longer be levied. The payment, collection, and filing of agricultural income tax will be fully automated for greater efficiency.\n\nLater, the Sindh Agricultural Income Tax Act Bill 2025 was presented in the house, which was unanimously approved by the house.\n\nEarlier, the Sindh Assembly unanimously passed the Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Institute of Democracy and Federalism Bill 2004, MH Panhor Institute of Sindh Studies Bill 2025.\n\nLater, the house was adjourned to Tuesday (today) at 2pm.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 4th, 2025",
