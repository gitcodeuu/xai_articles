One of the meetings was also attended by Chief of Army Staff Gen Syed Asim Munir, a source in the PM Office confirmed.\n\nUnder phase-I of the relocation plan, Afg­han nationals having the Afghan Cit­izens Card (ACC) will be “immediately” moved out of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.\n\nThey will then be sent back to Afghan­is­tan alongside illegal and undocumented refugees.\n\nACC is an identification document iss­u­ed to registered Afghan nationals by Nadra.\n\nAccording to the UN’s International Organisation for Migration (IOM), ACC gives temporary legal status to Afghans during their stay in Pakistan.\n\nHowever, the federal government makes the decision on the duration for which the ACC would remain valid.\n\nAfghan nationals who have a Proof of Reg­­istration Card (PoR), which allows them to stay anywhere in Pakistan legally, will be repatriated in the second phase of the plan.\n\nThey would be “moved out” of Islam­a­bad and Rawalpindi, but wouldn’t be dep­orted immediately, sources said, adding that the cabinet had allowed POR-holding Afghans to remain in the country till June.\n\nThe total number of Afghans living in Pakistan with PoR and ACC is estimated to be 1.3 million and 700,000, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, Afghans awaiting resettlement in third countries will be moved out of Islamabad and Rawalpindi by March 31.\n\nAccording to sources, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will coordinate with embassies and other global organisations to expedite the resettlement process.\n\nAny Afghans who couldn’t be resettled in a third country will also be sent back to Afghanistan.\n\nAccording to Shawn VanDiver, the founder of #AfghanEvac, a leading coalition of resettlement and veterans groups, 10,000 to 15,000 Afghans are in Pakistan waiting for visas or resettlement in the US.\n\nIt is unclear what number of these Afghans live in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. However, the decision to move them out of the twin cities is expected to create a host of logistical challenges for the refugees, many of whom have to visit foreign missions and offices of global humanitarian organisations in Islamabad.\n\nMany of the Afghan nationals awaiting resettlement to a third country are also enrolled in language centres in the federal capital.\n\nThe Ministry of Interior will lead the relocation and deportation plans, and intelligence agencies, IB and ISI, will monitor their implementation.\n\nPakistan started a nationwide crackdown in 2023 to deport millions of Afghans, which the government said were living illegally in the country.\n\nAccording to IOM, 805,991 Afghans have returned to their country since Sept 15, 2023.\n\nHuman rights activists and civil society members have criticised the forced repatriation and filed a petition in the Supreme Court.\n\nThe petition was last heard by a seven-judge bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-din Khan on January 7.\n\nDuring the hearing, the federal government assured the court that all registered Afghan refugees, including those having PoRs or ACC, would be provided full legal protection and not be apprehended or deported.\n\nHowever, in a report last month, IOM said hundreds of Afghan nationals were arrested and detained in Islamabad in the last two weeks of December.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 4th, 2025",
