Another person lost his life after sustaining fatal injuries in a similar incident that took place in a house in the city’s Faisal Colony.\n\nEarlier this month, at least six people died and 38 others were injured when a liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) tanker exploded in Punjab’s Multan. With two more succumbing to their injuries yesterday, the death toll reached 18. Another 20 persons burnt in the incident are still under treatment in the city’s Nishtar Hospital.",
