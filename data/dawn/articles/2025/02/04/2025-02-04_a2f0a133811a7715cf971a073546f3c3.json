  "content": "KARACHI: Legal proceedings at the City Courts and subordinate judiciary completely suspended on Monday on the strike call of the Karachi Bar Association (KBA) against the transfer of three high court judges to the Islam­abad High Court (IHC).\n\nLawyers belonging to the KBA stayed away from court to support the strike call announced by the Islamabad Bar Council, Islamabad High Court Bar Asso­ciation, and Islam­abad District Bar Association.\n\nThe City Courts wore a deserted look throughout the day and the majority of undertrial prisoners could not be produced in courts.\n\nAt a general body meeting, the KBA demanded that the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) postpone its meeting, which is set to consider names for eight vacancies in the Supreme Court, and urged its members to participate in a protest outside the top court next week.\n\nThe meeting was presided over by KBA president Aamir Nawaz Warr­aich and conducted by General Secretary Muha­mmad Rehman Korai.\n\nIn a resolution, the association condemned the transfer of judges to the IHC, terming it a “blatant attack on judicial independence” and an “unconstitutional and politically motivated” move.\n\n“This blatant attack on judicial independence not only violates Article 200 of the Constitution but also undermines the integrity of the judicial system of Pakistan,” the KBA said.\n\nIt added that the three judges were transferred allegedly “without due process and meaningful consultation”, which was a “dangerous attempt to manipulate the judiciary for vested interests”.\n\nThe association dema­nded reversing the “unconstitutional transfer” of the judges in IHC and urged the SC to take suo motu notice of the violation of judicial independence.\n\nIt warned that if the demands were not met, bar councils across the country would launch a nationwide protest to defend the sanctity of the courts.\n\nThe country’s largest bar also opposed the JCP’s meeting, convened to appoint additional judges to the top court and demanded that the JCP postpone its meeting.\n\n“This move is perceived as an overt attempt to manipulate the court’s composition in favour of individuals aligned with ruling parties and establishment interests. Such actions undermine the principle of judicial independence and erode public trust in the legal system.” the resolution stated.\n\nThe KBA urged that no new appointments should proceed until a decision is made on the petitions challenging the 26th Amendment.\n\nIt further added that these petitions should be heard by a full court comprising all 16 sitting judges of the top court.\n\nThe association also urged the legal community to participate in the All Pakistan Lawyers Convention on Feb 10 and to protest outside the Supreme Court against the appointment of additional judges to the top court.\n\nRegarding the recently passed amendments to Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act (Peca), the KBA stated that it considers it a tool for suppressing freedom of expression and curbing press freedom.\n\n“The KBA stands in solidarity with journalists and media houses in their struggle for unhindered press freedom and demands the immediate repeal of all restrictive laws targeting the media,” it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 4th, 2025",
