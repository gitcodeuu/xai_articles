From afar, sometimes you can’t even tell if a girl is playing or a boy,” the 19-year-old added.\n\nFinancial constraints can nonetheless be a significant hurdle as many talented athletes come from less affluent backgrounds.\n\n“They are motivated, but the expenses are their biggest difficulty,” explained Azam Sanaei, the coach of the Iranian women’s team.\n\nAccording to her, a hockey stick, which may need to be replaced every two months, costs around $200 — equal to the average monthly salary in Iran.\n\nDespite these challenges, the players remain highly motivated and show great potential, according to Sanaei.\n\nRahmani echoed this sentiment.\n\n“We work hard to achieve results,” said the young player who proudly wears the national jersey.\n\nHeader image: A player with team M.R prepares ahead of their Iranian Women’s League Ice Hockey match against team Hockey Panda at the Iran Mall ice rink in Tehran, Iran on January 29. — AFP",
