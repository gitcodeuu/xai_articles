The humanitarian agency then works with Congress and the White House to set its investment priorities, while the State Department provides it with foreign policy guidance.\n\nThe money is paid out through grants, contracts and “cooperative agreements”, according to USAID.\n\nIn the 2023 fiscal year, USAID managed more than $40 billion in combined appropriations, a recent report from the Congressional Research Service (CRS) noted.\n\nThat was more than a third of the overall budget approved for the State Department, foreign operations and related programmes.\n\nNevertheless, it only represented around 0.7 per cent of the US government’s $6.1 trillion in spending during that period.\n\nUSAID had projects in around 130 countries in 2023, the most recent year for which full data was available, according to CRS.\n\nThe top three recipients of aid are Ukraine, Ethiopia and Jordan respectively.\n\nThe scale of USAID’s funding for Ukraine is significant, with the war-torn European country receiving more than $16bn in macroeconomic support, according to US government data.\n\nIn 2023, 70 of the 77 countries the World Bank determined to be low- and lower-middle income countries received USAID assistance, the CRS report noted.\n\nOther top recipients of aid include the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan, South Sudan, and Syria.\n\nClose to $17bn in USAID funding in 2023 went to addressing “governance” issues, the CRS said, noting that most of that was destined for Ukraine.\n\nAdditionally, around $10.5bn went to addressing humanitarian issues, while $7bn was set aside for health, and around $1.3bn went to agriculture.\n\nUSAID also provided direct budgetary support to several countries around the world, including a cash transfer of more than $770 million to the government of Jordan, a key US ally in the Middle East, according to US government data.\n\nOther major programmes funded or managed by USAID in 2023 include $811m for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and more than $330m in emergency food and nutrition assistance for Afghanistan.\n\nThe White House published a statement on Monday highlighting the “waste and abuse” it said existed at USAID, including $1.5 million to “advance diversity equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities.”\n\nA USAID.gov fact sheet on what appeared to be a programme fitting that description in Serbia had been taken down by Monday evening.\n\nHeader image: People hold placards outside the USAID building, after billionaire Elon Musk, who is heading US President Donald Trump’s drive to shrink the federal government, said work is underway to shut down the US foreign aid agency USAID, in Washington, US on Feb 3, 2025. — Reuters/Kent Nishimura",
