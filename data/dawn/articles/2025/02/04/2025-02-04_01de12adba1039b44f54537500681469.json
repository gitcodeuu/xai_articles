Once he is done, all but about a dozen of his nearly 100 US-based employees will have been impacted, he said.\n\n“The last 10 days have been the worst 10 days of my professional life,” said Schmida. The funding for some of his projects was granted during the first Trump administration.\n\nAn official at a USAID implementing partner, who spoke on condition of anonymity due to fear of retribution, said the company had to furlough hundreds of US-based staff and were owed over $50 million by the US government in invoices from November and December that are past due.\n\nBoth the official and Schmida said they might have to go to court over the outstanding balances.\n\nMany of the USAID staff and contractors have expressed shock at how quickly the administration moved to fire people only a few days before their benefits and health insurance expired.\n\nRose Zulliger, who worked for the President’s Malaria Initiative as senior malaria technical adviser while a contractor for USAID, was one of them. She was terminated last week effective immediately and her benefits ended a few days later, leaving her scrambling to find insurance before her daughter’s scheduled tonsillectomy in three weeks.\n\n“It’s not just the personal stress of I’ve lost my job […] It’s also the reality that global health as we know it, and the work that we do — saving lives and also protecting Americans — has been put on pause, and the trust and relationships that we have worked so hard [for], that are so integral to the US influence in the global sphere, have all been ruptured,” Zulliger said.\n\nIn fiscal year 2023, the United States disbursed $72 billion of aid worldwide on everything from women’s health in conflict zones to access to clean water, HIV/AIDS treatments, energy security and anti-corruption work. It provided 42pc of all humanitarian aid tracked by the United Nations in 2024.\n\nThe funding, less than 1pc of its total budget, is instrumental in Washington’s effort to build alliances around the world, reinforce its diplomacy and counter the influence of adversaries such as China and Russia in the developing world.\n\nEsther Zeledon said she and her husband lost 95pc of their income as a result of Trump’s executive orders targeting foreign assistance and diversity measures. Zeledon worked part-time as an institutional support contractor for USAID and also had other contracts, while her husband, Paul Rivera, was a full-time institutional support contractor for the agency.\n\nThey are unsure if they will have to move in with Zeledon’s mother and father in a couple of months and have been discussing measures such as taking money from their 401(k) retirement plan to meet payments on continuing expenses.\n\n“It’s horrible because we had planned our entire year with our finances […] there’s so much uncertainty,” Zeledon said.\n\nOn Monday, dozens of USAID staff, contractors and Democratic lawmakers protested outside the agency’s offices in Washington after the staffers were told that the headquarters building would be shut for the day.\n\nAmong the crowd was Amanda Satterwhite, whose job is on hold without pay after she received an order last week to cease her job as an independent contractor, where she identified local groups abroad to which USAID could steer assistance rather than US-based organisations in an effort to spend more efficiently.\n\nSatterwhite said she isn’t certain how she and her husband will make their mortgage payments and she has already begun looking for a new job, because “no one is sure in what state the aid industry is going to return.”",
