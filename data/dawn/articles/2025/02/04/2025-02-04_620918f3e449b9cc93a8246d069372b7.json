  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan Assembly passed the law to tax agriculture income on Monday.\n\nThe Agriculture Income Tax Bill (AIT), introduced by Revenue Minister Mir Asim Kurd, said no tax would be imposed on agriculture income of up to Rs600,000 per annum.\n\nThere will be a 15 per cent tax on income between Rs600,000 and 1.2 million. A fixed tax of Rs90,000 will be charged on income between Rs1.2m and Rs1.6m. The tax on income between Rs1.6m and 3.2m will be Rs170,000.\n\nOn income between Rs3.2m and Rs5.6m, Rs650,000 will be charged as tax. The income over Rs5.6m will attract a tax rate of 40pc.\n\nResolution\n\nDuring the session on Monday, the assembly adopted a joint resolution condemning the Mangochar attack and termed the incident “an act carried out by anti-state elements”.\n\nLawmakers condemn Mangochar attack\n\nSoon after the assembly session, presided over by Deputy Speaker Ghazala Gola, began, provincial Minister for Planning and Development Mir Zahoor Buledi presented the joint resolution in the house on behalf of the movers.\n\nMr Buledi said that 18 security personnel were martyred in the Kalat attack.\n\n“The house strongly condemns this act of anti-state elements,” he added.\n\nThe resolution said the people of Balochistan stand in solidarity with members of security forces and they will not allow enemies of the country to succeed in their nefarious designs.\n\nTaking the floor of the house, Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said the security situation in Balochistan has become dangerous as anti-state elements were attacking and killing innocent civilians and members of security forces.\n\nHe offered meaningful dialogue to elements inv­olved in anti-state activities to find a solution to all issues, but said terrorists won’t be allowed to impose their will through violence .\n\nThe chief minister said that an in-camera meeting of the assembly would be held to discuss the situation and to form a course of action.\n\nHe stressed that the real issue lies in understanding as to who is actually serving the Baloch people: those who are helping to send their children to Oxford or those who are pushing them to become suicide bombers?\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 4th, 2025",
