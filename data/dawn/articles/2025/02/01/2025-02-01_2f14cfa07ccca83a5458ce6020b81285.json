  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Amid allegations of an unfair evaluation process, the National Highway Authority (NHA) on Friday shelved the opening of bids for Rs85 billion tranche III of the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) corridor project.\n\nInterestingly, the bids were set to be opened at 9:30am, but it was cancelled at the 11th hour when representatives of 11 shortlisted firms turned up at the NHA headquarters to witness the opening of the bids.\n\nReplying to Dawn’s query, the NHA spokesman said the bidding was shelved on the advice of the Grievance Redressal Committee (GRC).\n\nHe said the process will resume upon the GRC decision on the application of one of the bidders.\n\nTranche III has four lots (sections) for which technical and financial proposals were sought, and 20 firms submitted bids.\n\nThere were six companies in the run for 58km long lot-1 between Rajanpur-Jampur, seven for 64km long lot-2 between Jampur-DG Khan, five for 112km long lot-3 between DG Khan-Tibbi Qaisrani and two for 96km long lot-4 between Tibbi Qaisrani-DI Khan.\n\nLater, after technical evaluation, five firms were qualified for lot-1 and lot-2 each, four firms for lot-3 and two firms for lot-4. The total PC-I cost of these lots is Rs85.44bn. Under tranche-III, an additional carriageway would be built on N-55 between Rajhanpur-DG Khan and DI Khan in which a two-lane highway would be converted into four-lane highway.\n\nThe NHA is already executing CAREC tranche-I and trance-II. The tranche-I includes a 66.37km long section-I between Petaro-Sehawan and a 43.4km long section-II between Ratodero-Shikarpur.\n\nThe source said some of the firms have complained about unfair play in the bidding process and that some favourites were given an edge.\n\nThe CAREC Programme is a partnership of 11 countries and development partners working together to promote development through cooperation, leading to accelerated economic growth and poverty reduction. It is guided by the overarching vision of “Good Neighbours, Good Partners, and Good Prospects.”\n\nThe programme is a proactive facilitator of practical, results-based regional projects, and policy initiatives critical to sustainable economic growth and shared prosperity in the region.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 1st, 2025",
