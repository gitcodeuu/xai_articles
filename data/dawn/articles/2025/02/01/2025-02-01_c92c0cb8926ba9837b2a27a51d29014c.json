  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) is all set to prepare the design of the first ever proposed cricket stadium in Islamabad, as the interior minister directed the civic agency to take steps for the launch of several new projects.\n\nSources said Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi while chairing a late night meeting at the CDA headquarters on Wednesday expressed displeasure over non-completion of the stadium’s design. He directed the CDA to get the design finalised as soon as possible.\n\nThe sources said following the directive, the civic agency will hire services of a consultant for designing the stadium.\n\nLast year, the CDA and the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) held several meetings for the construction of the cricket stadium.\n\nInterior minister directs civic agency to take steps for launch of several new projects\n\nA delegation of PCB officials twice visited the CDA headquarters and held meetings with officials led by then Chairman Noorul Amin Mengal.\n\nSources in the CDA said that the location of new stadium was not discussed in the meetings, but most likely the civic agency will construct the stadium near D-12 in the foothills of Margalla Hills.\n\nLast year, the CDA had announced that the stadium and a hotel will be constructed near D-12 and the stadium will be the largest in the country with the seating capacity of over 50,000.\n\nAccording to initial discussions between CDA and PCB last year, it was proposed that the PCB will complete the construction of the stadium within five years. It was decided that the CDA will allot 280 kanals for the stadium on a 99-year lease.\n\nIt was also proposed that revenue generated from the facility will be divided between PCB and CDA on the ratio of 70:30.\n\nThe two organisations in the past had started a project for the construction of a stadium at Shakarparian; however, it was scrapped by the Supreme Court.\n\nIn 1960, a Greek firm, Doxiadis Associates, prepared Islamabad’s master plan and declared 2,250 acres as a sports centre in Shakarparian. The boundary of the area touches Islamabad Highway in the north and Murree Road in the south and east.\n\nThe government constructed the sports complex, a museum, Lok Virsa, a golf course and Islamabad Club in the area.\n\nHowever, in 1979, through a notification, the government ended the independent status of the area and included it in the national park, which led to the scrapping of the stadium project by the apex court.\n\nSources said during the meeting chaired by Mr Naqvi, several other proposed projects were discussed that included a design of the extension of Margalla Road up to the motorway, traffic congestion issue at Faizabad, proposed Safari Park and chairlift and zip line.\n\nThe meeting also discussed setting up of commercial strips on both sides of the expressway. The CDA had acres of land on the right of way of the expressway and there are also reports about encroachment on the civic agency’s land.\n\nIn many areas along the expressway, due to growth of private graveyards, CDA is losing its land.\n\nHowever, many officials said while planning commercial strips on both sides, the planning wing should keep the sensitivity of the green area in mind as the city had been losing its green cover due to growing construction activities.\n\n“There should be no large scale development activities, setting up rest areas /restaurants, petrol pumps etc., are good options. Let’s see what happens as the proposal is at a very preliminary stage,” said an official.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 1st, 2025",
