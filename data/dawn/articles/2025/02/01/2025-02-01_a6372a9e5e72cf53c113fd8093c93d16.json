They paid tribute to Hussain’s services.\n\nTwo of Hussain’s brothers were also martyred in previous terrorism incidents.\n\nKurram has been beset by intermittent flare-ups of violence between tribes that have been feuding for decades over lands. Most recently, at least 130 lives were lost in attacks and ensuing clashes since November, before a hard-won ceasefire agreement was brokered on January 1. However, attacks on government and aid convoys this month have put the fragile peace in peril.\n\nThe ceasefire suffered another major setback when Assistant Commissioner (Revenue) Saeed Manan, who was mediating to halt fresh clashes between the warring sides, was shot in the stomach and injured along with two others in a separate firing incident in the Bushehra area of the restive district yesterday.\n\nManan underwent surgery at DHQ hospital and was later transferred to Peshawar via helicopter.\n\nOn Jan 4, an attack in the Bagan area injured Deputy Commissioner Javedullah Mehsud and six others. In a Jan 16 attack on a convoy in the same area, two security officials were martyred and five others injured. Retaliatory action by security forces left six attackers dead and 10 injured.\n\nIn response, authorities launched a limited “counter-terrorism operation” in Lower Kurram on Jan 19, which used gunship helicopters and concluded after four days.",
