However, the victim’s family said it was caused by embers.\n\nThe police said several huts were set up on a vacant plot near Range Road where Abdul Muaz, the victim, was alone when the fire erupted.\n\nShortly after the fire broke out, Rescue 1122 firefighters reached the spot and brought the flames under control.\n\nLater, the local police also reached the spot and launched an investigation. Police said that more than five huts were reduced to ashes in the fire.\n\nThe incident was reportedly the third in a series of similar incidents in recent days. Earlier on Tuesday, a seven-month-old infant was burnt alive after being trapped in a fire in Rawat.\n\nIn another tragic incident, a four-year-old boy who had been missing for the last two months was found dead in a pond.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 1st, 2025",
