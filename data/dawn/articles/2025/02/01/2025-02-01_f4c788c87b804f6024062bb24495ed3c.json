The UK team’s evaluation came after months of preparatory meetings between Pakistani and British aviation authorities.\n\nThe CAA is hopeful about the outcome, citing extensive preparations regarding international aviation safety requirements.\n\nThe ban on Pakistan’s natio­nal carrier operating in the EU was lifted by the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) in November last year.\n\nThe restriction was imposed in 2020 after a PIA plane crash and pilots’ licence scandal.\n\nAfter the ban on Pakistani flights was lifted by EASA, PIA resumed flights to European destinations.\n\nThe PIA is keen to fly to London, Birmingham and Manchester from Islamabad and Lahore.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 1st, 2025",
