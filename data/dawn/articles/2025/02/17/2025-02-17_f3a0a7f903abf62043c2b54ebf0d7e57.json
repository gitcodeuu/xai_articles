The statement added that the delegation will discuss investments and economic development projects during their visit.\n\nIn an interview with Nikkei Asia on February 14, Najy Benhassine, World Bank country manager for Pakistan, described the CPF as “not a loan program alone” but rather a “comprehensive engagement”.\n\n“We provide technical assistance, advisory services and analytical support alongside financing,” he added.\n\nThe CPF is designed as a long-term approach with the flexibility to adjust to evolving circumstances and shocks.\n\nAlthough the size and ambition of World Bank Group funding for the CPF is estimated at around $30-40bn over 10 years, project documents suggest that the actual lending envelope for FY26-35 will total around $20bn.\n\nOf this, around $14bn will come from International Development Association (IDA) funding. The bank has recently achieved the replenishment target of $100bn under IDA21, and the $14bn figure is based on the assumption that the funding available in the coming cycles remains constant in real terms and about the average of IDA18, IDA19, and IDA20 amounts.\n\nThese are the funds available to the association, committed by donors who meet every three years to replenish IDA resources and review its policy framework.\n\nA second component derives from International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) funds, which are estimated at around $6bn. These depend on country demands, overall macroeconomic performance, global economic/financial developments that affect IBRD’s financial capacity, and demands by other borrowers.\n\nThe IBRD is the lending arm of the World Bank Group and is one of the two international financial institutions — alongside the International Monetary Fund — established by the Bretton Woods agreement after the second World War.\n\nAccording to the bank, IBRD has provided over $48.3bn in assistance since 1950, and the bank’s current portfolio includes 106 projects and a total commitment of $17bn in Pakistan.\n\nAccording to the statement, the PM apprised the delegation about the progress of Pakistan’s economic reforms, stating that there were positive developments.\n\n“Our exports and remittances are increasing,” he said. “Investment in manufacturing has risen due to low interest rates and to control corruption, work on digitisation in the FBR (Federal Board of Revenue) is continuing on a priority basis.”\n\nPM Shehbaz also added that in the power sector, the country has experienced an “uninterrupted power supply” alongside a deficit reduction.\n\nThe PM continued: “Through SIFC (Special Investment Facilitation Council), we have created an attractive environment for investors. This unique system involves all stakeholders.”",
