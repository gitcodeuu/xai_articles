We hope that the calm will continue and that Egypt will pressure Israel to prevent them from restarting the war and displacing people,” said Nasser al-Astal, 62, a retired teacher in southern Gaza’s Khan Yunis.\n\nNegotiations on a second phase of the truce, aimed at securing a more lasting end to the war, could begin this week in Doha, a Hamas official and another source familiar with the talks have said.\n\nShoulder to shoulder\n\nTrump has warned of repercussions for neighbouring Egypt and Jordan unless they accept displaced Gazans under his plan.\n\nOn Sunday, Rubio said Trump showed “courage and vision” on Gaza, aiming to move past “the same tired ideas of the past”.\n\nThe Gaza war triggered violent fallout throughout the Middle East, where Iran backs fighters in Yemen and Lebanon.\n\nIsrael also fought against Ham­as’s Lebanese ally Hezbollah, severely weakening it.\n\nThere were also limited direct strikes by Iran and Israel against each other.\n\nRubio called Iran the “single greatest source of instability in the region”.\n\nNetanyahu said that with the support of the Trump administration, “I have no doubt that we can and will finish the job” against Iran.\n\n“Israel and America stand shoulder to shoulder in countering the threat of Iran,” he said.\n\nOn Sunday, Hamas said an Israeli air strike killed three police officers near south Gaza’s Rafah in what the group called a “serious violation” of the truce.\n\nIt is at least the second Israeli air strike in Gaza since the ceasefire began.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
