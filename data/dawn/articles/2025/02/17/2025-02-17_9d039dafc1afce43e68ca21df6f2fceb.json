The path to recovery lies in businesses that embrace openness, accountability, and ethical leadership—values that strengthen not just reputations but the economy as a whole.”\n\nLast week, Transparency International said that Pakistan’s ranking on the Corruption Perception Index 2024 dropped by two spots from 133 in 2023 to 135 in 2024 out of 180 countries.",
