  "content": "QUETTA: A dispute between Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti and Agriculture Minister Mir Ali Hassan Zehri over transfer and posting in Hub district turned serious, forcing the PPP top leadership to intervene and resolve the issue through negotiations.\n\nSources claimed that on the instructions of President Asif Ali Zardari, the chairperson of party’s women wing, Faryal Talpur, called a meeting of all PPP MPAs, MNAs and senators from Balochistan at her residence in Clifton, Karachi, on Saturday and discussed the issues in detail.\n\nSeveral party members called on Ms Talpur and MNA Ejaz Jakhrani and gave their point of view regarding the issues, including allotment of land, which had caused differences between Mr Zehri and CM Bugti.\n\nMr Zehri, who is considered close to President Zardari, informed Ms Talpur about the situation and the cause of differentness with the chief minister.\n\nIssues cropped over Balochistan CM’s refusal to hire people suggested by minister\n\nAfter holding separate meetings with parliamentarians, Ms Talpur assigned Malik Shah Gorgage, a PPP MNA from Makran, the task to settle the dispute.\n\nMr Gorgage while confirming his meeting with Ms Talpur said: “I have been assigned by Faryal Talpur to mediate between\n\nChief Minister Bugti and Ali Hassan Zehri to resolve the issue.”\n\nTalking to media by phone, the MNA said he will meet the two PPP leaders separately.\n\nHe expressed hope that the differences will be resolved through negotiations.\n\nParty insiders claimed that a majority of PPP leaders from Balochistan, who held separate meetings with Ms Talpur, expressed satisfaction over CM Bugti’s performance, though they also made some complaints.\n\nHowever, sources said some other parliamentarians had informed the PPP leadership about their reservations.\n\nThey said that after detailed negotiations it was decided to give the role of a mediator to Mr Gorgage to resolve the differences.\n\nIt may be recalled that differences between CM Bugti and Mir Zehri deepened two days back when the latter presented to CM Bugti a list of his demands, including transfer and posting of officials in Hub district and demanded that vacant posts be filled without any delay.\n\nSources in CM House said Mr Bugti refused to appoint the officials recommended by Mir Zehri.\n\nThe CM told him that he was heading a coalition government in which it is not possible.\n\nThe sources said that on the occasion hot words were exchanged from both sides and Mir Zehri left the CM House despite some party leaders’ efforts for reconciliation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
