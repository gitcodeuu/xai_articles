Hical, a supplier to Raytheon Technology and Boeing among others, aims to double revenue to five billion rupees ($57.57 million) from its aerospace division in three years, said Yashas Jaiveer Shashikiran, joint managing director.\n\nJJG Aero, also in Bengaluru’s industrial hub, took 12 years to hit $2m in revenue but soared to $20m in the last six, said CEO Anuj Jhunjhunwala.\n\nThe growth is part of an Asia-Pacific aerospace surge, with 2024 revenue projected to be 54 per cent above 2019 levels, while North America and Europe remain 3pc and 4pc lower, according to Accenture Research.\n\n“Earlier, we were chasing customers. Now, they are equally interested in evaluating Indian machine shops,” Jhunjhunwala said, adding that contracts were being signed more quickly and onboarding processes were being done much faster than ever before.\n\nThe companies produce parts for landing gear, wings, fuselage, electrical switches and motion control systems essential for flight safety and performance.\n\nLeading Western plane and engine manufacturers, whose output has been constrained by strikes, production caps, and parts and labour shortages since the pandemic, say they want to source more from India to meet rising demand for air travel.\n\n“India is the best solution to supply chain challenges,” Huw Morgan, senior vice president for aerospace procurement at Rolls-Royce, said last week at an industry event.\n\n“Our engine volumes are growing at around 20pc and the traditional supply chains are just not able to support it,” Morgan said. “India is … the best cost market.”\n\nThe British company plans to double sourcing from India within five years.\n\nThe country is among the biggest aircraft buyers in the world, yet accounts for only 1pc of the global supply chain market, according to the recently formed Aerospace India Association (AIA).\n\n“Post-Covid, the global aerospace industry has reached an inflection point. While this shift began in 2020, aerospace is a slow-moving industry — it takes time for changes to materialise,” said Aravind Melligeri of supplier Aequs.\n\nIndia, the world’s third-largest domestic aviation market by seats, is also among the fastest-growing, driving demand for maintenance services and parts.\n\nMassive aircraft orders from IndiGo and Air India are fuelling growth across the aviation ecosystem, Air India CEO Campbell Wilson told Reuters.\n\nAlthough Indian firms have long supplied the $180bn global aerospace industry, they are now moving beyond basic manufacturing to higher-value work such as design, engineering and system integration.\n\nAirbus in 2024 awarded its second aircraft door contract within a year to Indian suppliers.\n\n“India is contributing more than 1bn euros currently in the overall Airbus supply chain and we expect to double that. Every commercial aircraft of Airbus today has some part or component that is made in India,” said Michel Narchi, head Of international operations at Airbus.\n\nIndia’s civil aviation ministry held a meeting last week with industry leaders about boosting component manufacturing, said AIA Director General Srinivasan Dwarakanath. The association represents both Indian and global firms.\n\nHe said a key step towards real value addition would be the local sourcing of raw materials such as aluminium, steel, and titanium, eventually leading to the certification of designs made by Indian suppliers.\n\nThe AIA estimates that India’s aerospace industry will capture 10pc of the global supply chain market within a decade, with the global market projected to reach $250bn annually by 2033.\n\n“India also had the initial challenges of being physically farther away from the main markets of the US and Europe. Engineering approvals, qualification timings, raw material sourcing — it took some time to build the ecosystem, but now India is all set,” said Hical’s Yashas Jaiveer.",
