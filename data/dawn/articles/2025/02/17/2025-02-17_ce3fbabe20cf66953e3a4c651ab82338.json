He understands the importance of freedom and democracy around the world. I look forward to working with him to restore democracy in Pakistan.”\n\nCongressman Jack Bergman also voiced support for the movement, even tweeting about his meeting with Dr Alvi and former Imran Khan aide Dr Shahbaz Gill.\n\nBut while Pakistani Americans found some sympathetic ears in Congress, the overall stance from Washington remained focused on US strategic interests.\n\nCongressman Brian Mast, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Co­m­mittee, made it clear that while Washington acknowledged concerns about democracy in Pakistan, US foreign policy would remain centred on national security and economic priorities.\n\nAt PAKPAC’s 5th Annual Bipartisan Congressional Open House, Mast reinforced this position, stating, “We will ensure that every dollar spent is aligned with America’s national security and interests.”\n\nSouth Asia expert Michael Kugelman echoed this sentiment, noting that in President Trump’s second term, Pakistan would need to offer concrete benefits to secure US support.\n\n“‘What’s in it for us?’ would be the defining question for American policymakers,” he said.\n\nPAKPAC also used the campaign to highlight broader issues affecting Pakistan’s governance and economy, distributing distributed policy papers on key challenges, including the country’s energy crisis; repression of institutions such as the judiciary and media; the effectiveness of US aid programmes, etc.\n\nAlthough Pakistani American activists have demonstrated a growing momentum in Washington, their influence remains constrained by broader US foreign policy priorities.\n\nWhile such efforts have drawn attention to democratic issues in Pakistan, experts like Shuja Nawaz of the Atlantic Council caution that appeals based on Pakistan’s strategic location or population size will no longer be enough. Instead, Pakistan must build financial and political self-sufficiency to strengthen its standing in Washington, he said.\n\nThe lobbying campaign underscored Pakistani Americans’ increasing engagement with lawmakers, signalling an intent to remain active in shaping US policy toward Pakistan. However, their success will ultimately depend on how well they align their concerns with America’s evolving geopolitical priorities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
