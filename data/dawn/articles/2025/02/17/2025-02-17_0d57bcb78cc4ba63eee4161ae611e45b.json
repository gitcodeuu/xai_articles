Duminy and ex-New Zealand pacer Tim Southee.\n\n“Those were unforgettable moments for us after lifting the trophy,” added Sarfraz with other members of that history-making side including Azhar Ali, Mohammad Hafeez, Wahab Riaz, Haris Sohail, Imad Wasim, Mohammad Amir, Hasan Ali, Junaid Khan and Shadab Khan among the audience.\n\nDuring the discussion, hosted by former West Indies fast bowler Ian Bishop, Duminy predicted that Afghanistan “could be a dark horse” for the semi-finals.\n\nAfghanistan are in Group ‘B’ alongside South Africa, Australia and England.\n\nPakistan and New Zealand, who clash in the tournament opener on Wednesday, are in Group ‘A’ alongside India and Bangladesh.\n\nAfghanistan, New Zealand and South Africa are already in Karachi for their opening matches next week; the latter two having featured in a tri-series against the hosts which concluded on Friday.\n\nHaving seen his former team-mates coast to the tri-series title, Southee was looking forward for more. “We’re in for some very entertaining cricket in the next few days,” he said.\n\nThe tournament marks the first ICC tournament on Pakistan soil since it co-hosted the 1996 ODI World Cup and ICC h chief executive Geoff Allardice hopes it will be memorable.\n\n“The Pakistani nation has great passion for cricket,” he said, appreciating the work put in by the Pakistan Cricket Board to renovate the three stadia in Rawalpindi, Karachi and Lahore for the tournament.\n\nPCB chief Mohsin Naqvi, meanwhile, said the tournament is an opportunity for the “country to show its great hospitality and culture”.\n\nThe Champions Trophy opening ceremony was held for the first time without the participating teams following India’s refusal to send its team to Pakistan.\n\nThere will be no captains’ photoshoot or news conference with all of India’s matches being played in the United Arab Emirates.\n\nThe agreement will also see Pakistan play its matches on neutral venues during tournaments hosted by India.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
