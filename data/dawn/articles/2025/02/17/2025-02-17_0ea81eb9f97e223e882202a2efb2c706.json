  "content": "BUKAVU: Columns of M23 fighters allied with Rwandan troops on Sunday entered the centre of another key city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as the African Union highlighted growing fears that the strife-torn country could break up.\n\nThe fighters reached outlying districts of Bukavu, capital of South Kivu province, on Friday.\n\nThe fall of the city of one million people, which was barely defended by the Congolese armed forces (FARDC), gives the M23 total control of Lake Kivu, following its capture of Goma, capital of neighbouring North Kivu province, at the end of January.\n\nGrowing international calls have been made for Rwanda to end its military backing for M23. It denies that its troops are in the DRC. As they entered Bukavu, M23 fighters were applauded by some residents on the streets or huddled on balconies, journalists noted.\n\nTroops who abandoned the city left behind weapons that have been collected by civilians and bandits\n\nNear the border post linking the town with neighbouring Rwanda, some chanted: “You’re the ones we’ve been waiting for, we need change in this country, we want work.” “We have welcomed our liberators, it’s an immense joy that floods my heart,” said Kigohwa Kalimbasha, a Bukavu resident.\n\nSome called on the troops to march on Kinshasa, the country’s capital. The Congolese armed forces who abandoned Bukavu on Friday left behind weapons that were collected by civilians and bandits.\n\nThere was extensive looting across the weekend and most residents took refuge in their homes for safety.\n\n‘Regional escalation’\n\nMen, women and children, some of whom picked up weapons left by the retreating army, stormed several parts of the city. Witnesses saw looters making off with oil, bags of flour and cases of beer under their arms.\n\nIn a statement on Saturday, M23 instructed Bukavu’s population to organise “into vigilance committees to ensure security”. The group also demanded “the immediate withdra­wal” of Burundi soldiers who support the Congolese army in the province.\n\nSome gunfire could still be heard on Sunday, especially near the town’s military base.\n\n“M23 fighters are chasing some soldiers who were still hanging around in the camp and some civilians who were taking part in the looting,” said one resident reached by phone.\n\nIn a statement the DRC government said it was following developments in Bukavu “hour-by-hour”, and accused Rwanda of “plans of occupation, of pillages” in the east.\n\nWith fears that the offensive could ignite a regional war, the international community has multiplied calls for a de-escalation and\n\nceasefire, so far in vain. “We don’t want a balkanisation of eastern DRC,” the African Union’s Peace and Security Commissioner Bankole Adeoye told reporters at a summit in Addis Ababa.\n\nWithout mentioning Rwanda, he added: “We are calling for the immediate removal of M23 and their supporters from all towns and cities including Goma airport.”\n\nUN chief Antonio Guterres, speaking at the opening of the AU summit, demanded that the DRC’s “territorial integrity” be respected and a regional war avoided.\n\nThe French foreign ministry called for an immediate withdrawal of Rwandan troops, while Britain on Sunday warned that the Rwandan-backed offensive risked sparking “a wider regional conflict”.\n\nThe DRC claims that some 4,000 Rwandan soldiers are in the east of the country.\n\nThe conflict with M23 has lasted more than three years, with Kinshasa accusing Kigali of wanting to control the mining and trade of minerals used in batteries and electronic equipment, and also of trying to appropriate land for agriculture.\n\nRwanda denies the charges, and says its security is threatened by armed groups in the region, notably the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), created by former Hutu leaders linked to the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
