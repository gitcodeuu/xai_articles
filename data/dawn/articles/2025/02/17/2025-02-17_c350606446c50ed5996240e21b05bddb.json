  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The poor record of sector development by the CDA apparently played a major role in making the balloting of plots in C-14 a flop, as majority of the overseas Pakistanis did not deposit their payments within the stipulated time.\n\nThe CDA had last month offered 263 plots in C-14 to overseas Pakistanis (against Rs60 million each) with the expatriates showing an overwhelming response. They were supposed to make the payments within 10 months with depositing the first installment in a month. The one-month deadline lapsed on Friday.\n\nSources said majority of the buyers did not deposit their installments as they were no longer interested in these plots.\n\nThe sources said the track record of the CDA in sector development was highly poor as it never completed development of sectors within the deadlines.\n\nMajority of expatriates did not deposit first installment within deadline perhaps due to CDA’s poor sector development, says official\n\nIt is relevant to note that amongst other stalled sectors there is E-12, which was launched by the CDA in 1989 and despite the passage of 36 long years the allottees are still waiting for the development of the sector.\n\nSimilarly, the development work in C-15, C-16, I-15 and I-12 has been in progress for the last many years without completion.\n\nWhen contacted, CDA spokesperson Shahid Kiani denied that the balloting of C-14 was a flop. In fact, more than 1700 applicants have applied for C-14 which is an overwhelming response. He said initially it was only offered to the overseas Pakistanis who submitted their installments in foreign exchange which was an added value for the government.\n\nAsked how many people deposited the installments by Friday, he said: “At this stage, I can’t confirm it since it’s the weekend and banks are closed. We will collect record from banks in next few days and would confirm it. We have a large waiting list of applicants. They would be offered the opportunity if the overseas Pakistanis won’t submit installment in the first instance,” he said.\n\nTo a query, he said work continued in all sectors and current management had been focusing on resolving issues and completing the remaining development work in all ongoing sectors.\n\nHe said the CDA had started handing over the possession of I-15 while the possession of 1-12 would also be given in coming months. The possession of C-14 would be handed over before the full payment.\n\n“I don’t agree that stalled sectors have anything to do with C-14.” He said 1700 people had applied for plots in the sector, so there are hundreds of applications in the backup.\n\nIt may be noted that sector development is the main work of CDA. However, the civic agency has failed to perform its core business. Even last year, the CDA handed over its 10,000 kanals to Defence Housing Authority (DHA) for development of Margalla Enclave as a joint venture.\n\n“The core business of CDA is to develop new sectors, but we have failed in this regard. Now time has come CDA should take steps not only to complete ongoing development work but also start development of other acquired sectors,” said an official of the CDA.\n\nStalled sectors\n\nE-12, the CDA never made any serious attempts to start development work in this sector until 2021. However, in 2021, the development work was launched in the three sub-sectors 1, 2 and 3 while sub-sector 4 was in possession of landholders. But that too could not be completed yet.\n\nMeanwhile, CDA has four sectors along the Margalla Road – C-13, C-14, C-15 and C-16. Work in C-13 has never started while in 2022 CDA awarded contract for development of C-14 and C-15. Work in these two sectors was supposed to be completed by June last but THE contractor missed the deadline which was extended by the CDA.\n\nSources said work continued in C-14 at a substantial pace with a target of completion this year. But after completing around 30pc work in C-15, it was halted months ago.\n\nThe sources said that there was no issue of adverse possession of land in C-14, but in C-15 the civic agency faced resistance from locals as it was yet to clear their Built Up Property (BuP) cases finalised in 2016. Similarly, the sources said, development work in two sub-sectors (3 and 4) of C-16 was started with full pace, but in the remaining two sub-sectors (1 and 2) work could not be started as compensation details were pending.\n\nMeanwhile, the development work in sub-sectors 2 and 3 of I-12 was supposed to be completed in April last year, but the deadline was extended. In this sector, work is delayed but continues.\n\nExplaining the current situation of I-15, CDA officials said work in three sub-sectors of the sector had been completed and only 20pc work in sub-sector 1 was pending. Besides, it is not clear when the CDA would start development of several other acquired sectors, including D-13, E-13, F-13 and H-16.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
