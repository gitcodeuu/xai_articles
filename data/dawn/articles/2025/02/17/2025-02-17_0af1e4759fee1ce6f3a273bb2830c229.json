He urged the UN agencies to fulfill their commitment so that they must be shifted on a war-footing basis. He said that the resources should be used in favour of both countries. Pakistan had hosted around three million Afghans for many years, but “it is a fact that you will have to go”, he said.\n\nThe federal minister said, “All [stakeholders] will have to play their role to send Afghan refugees back to their country, with respect and dignity. You [Afghan refugees] and we will also be happy if you go back to your home country.”\n\nThe acting commissioner for Afghan refugees in Sindh, Qaimuddin Ansari, and representative of Afghan refugees in Sindh, Abdullah Bukhair, also spoke on the occasion.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
