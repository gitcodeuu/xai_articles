  "content": "MANSEHRA: The prolonged dry spell in the erstwhile tribal belt of Torghar has caused severe water shortage as most of the natural streams and fountains have dried up.\n\n“This is happening for the first time in decades that most of the streams and fountains, which are major source of water supply to local settlements, have dried up due to the prolonged dry spell in our district,” Umarul Rasheed, chairman of Dda Banda village council, told reporters on Sunday.\n\nWomen and children from Jabara, Halima, Dda Banda, Payando, and neighboring villages in Dor Mera tehsil of the district have to fetch water in canisters and utensils from far-off areas carrying them on their heads and backs, he said.\n\nFlanked by tribesmen, Mr Rasheed said: “We have been expecting rain since the start of winter in November last year, but only light rain has fallen two or three times, fading our hopes,” he said.\n\nResidents say most of natural springs, fountains have dried up\n\nHe added that apart from local settlements cattle and sheep were also badly affected by the water shortage. “Would you believe that local boys and girls spend hours fetching water from far-off areas, which adversely affects their education,” Mr Rasheed said.\n\nAnother local resident, Rubnawaz Khan said that lawmakers were not taking the water crisis seriously. “The existing water supply schemes, which were installed by locals on a self-help basis, have also dried up. Unfortunately, local lawmakers have ignored this burning issue in our district,” he regretted.\n\nMr Khan urged the government to ensure the revival of the water supply schemes.\n\nLAND FOR GRAVEYARDS: Residents of the city and its suburbs on Sunday demanded of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly Speaker Babar Saleem Swati to ensure the early acquisition of land for graveyards.\n\n“The burial spaces in the existing cemeteries are already full, and locals are facing difficulties in burying their dead. However, Rs200 million allocated for land acquisition has remained unutilised since 2017,” Mohammad Ayub, a local resident, told reporters.\n\nThe residents of Channia, Dub, Lohar Banda, Nogazi, Jander Banda, Mohallah Ayub Khan, and adjoining localities have been struggling with a shortage of burial space.\n\nMr Ayub said that the district administration had had Rs200 million in its account for graveyard land acquisition since 2017, yet the funds remain unutilised.\n\n“PA Speaker Babar Saleem Swati should ensure that the district administration uses that money to acquire land for graveyard,” he said.\n\nAnother local resident, Mohammad Bashir Tanoli, said that committees formed by locals in different areas had been purchasing small pieces of land for graveyards for a long time.\n\n“Since land prices have surged to unaffordable levels in the district, these committees have been unable to acquire land for graveyards,” Mr Tanoli said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
