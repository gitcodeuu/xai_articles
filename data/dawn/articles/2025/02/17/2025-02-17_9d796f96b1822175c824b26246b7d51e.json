Both of them,” he said, adding “Zelensky wants to end it too.”\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky meanwhile said on Sunday he believes Russia is preparing to “wage war” against a weakened Nato should Trump dilute US support for the alliance.\n\nTrump appeared to dismiss Zelensky’s remarks, telling reporters he was “not even a little bit” concerned about the Ukrainian leader’s messaging.\n\nThe Republican had repeatedly insisted he would end the Ukraine conflict in a single day if he returned to the White House, but Rubio stressed it would “not be easy” to resolve such a long-running, bloody and complex conflict.\n\n“A process towards peace is not a one-meeting thing,” America’s top diplomat said in an interview with CBS on the sidelines of the Munich Security Conference.\n\nRubio is set to lead a high-level US team to Riyadh, but it remains unclear whether there will be any Ukrainian participation. Rubio said he wasn’t even sure who Moscow was sending.\n\n“Nothing’s been finalised yet,” he said, adding the aim was to seek an opening for a broader conversation that “would include Ukraine and would involve the end of the war.”\n\nWitkoff and US National Security Adviser Michael Waltz are both expected to attend the talks.\n\nTrump and Putin held a lengthy phone call on Wednesday in which they agreed to start ceasefire negotiations immediately.\n\nThe call blindsided Nato allies as well as Kyiv, with Zelensky insisting there should be “no decisions about Ukraine without Ukraine”.\n\n“Right now there is no process,” said Rubio, who spoke by phone on Saturday with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. “One phone call does not make peace.”\n\nIn an interview with NBC broadcast on Sunday, Zelensky had said Putin was a serial liar and could not be trusted as a negotiating partner.\n\n“I don’t think in geopolitics, anyone should trust anyone,” Rubio said. “The next few weeks and days will determine whether (Putin) is serious or not.”",
