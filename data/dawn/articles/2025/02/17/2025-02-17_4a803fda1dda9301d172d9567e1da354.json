  "content": "KARACHI: Pakistan fast bowler Haris Rauf has recovered from his injury and will be available for the side’s ICC Champions Trophy opener against New Zealand on Wednesday, the Press Trust of India (PTI) news agency reported on Sunday.\n\nAccording to PTI, source close to the Pakistan team confirmed on Sunday that Haris, who sustained a muscular strain in his lower chest wall during the recently-concluded tri-nation series — which involved New Zealand and South Africa along with the hosts — is available for the Champions Trophy.\n\n“Haris is okay now and the rest given to him after the first match of the tri-Series has helped him recover well,” PTI quoted the source as saying. The source added that Pakistan had no fitness issues with any other player.\n\nHaris, one of Pakistan’s key bowlers with his express pace and ability to take wickets in the middle overs, has remained with the squad despite the selectors calling up uncapped Akif Javed as a backup for him.\n\nHaris has a haul of 83 wickets in 46 One-day Internationals and another 110 wickets in 79 T20Is as he has built a reputation as a specialist white-ball bowler.\n\nFormer Pakistan left-arm pacer Muhammad Amir had on Saturday expressed his concerns on a TV channel about Haris’ fitness for the Champions Trophy. Amir claimed that if the pacer had suffered a side strain it would take five to six weeks to heal completely.\n\nPakistan lost to New Zealand twice in the tri-series, including in the final on Friday, and will be eager to make amends in the Champions Trophy opener as the defending champions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 17th, 2025",
