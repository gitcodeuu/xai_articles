A video posted to PTV News’ official X (formerly Twitter) account showed footage of such devices that have been unearthed in the past.\n\nSecurity sources claimed that four Indian IEDs were recovered from the Battal sector and Rawalakot area in the first week of February, while one civilian lost his life in an explosion.\n\nAdditionally, on Wedn­esday, two Pakistani soldiers were injured in what was described as an unprovoked ceasefire violation by Indian troops in the Deva and Bagsar sectors.\n\nPakistan has formally protested India’s alleged attempts to transport IEDs and create unrest in AJK, while also sharing evidence of these activities with UN observers, PTV News said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2025",
