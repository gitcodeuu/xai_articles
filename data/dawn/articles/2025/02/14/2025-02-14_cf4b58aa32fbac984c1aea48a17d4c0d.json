  "content": "WASHINGTON: The USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier collided with a merchant vessel in the Mediterranean Sea, the US Navy said on Thursday.\n\nThe warship’s collision with the Besiktas-M took place late the previous day while the carrier was operating near Port Said in Egypt, US Sixth Fleet spokesperson Commander Timothy Gorman said in a statement.\n\n“The collision did not endanger the Harry S. Truman (CVN 75) as there are no reports of flooding or injuries. The propulsion plants are unaffected and in a safe and stable condition,” Gorman said, adding that the incident was under investigation.\n\nThe statement did not mention the condition of the Besiktas-M after the collision. Shipping websites listed the merchant ship as being a bulk carrier that flies the Panamanian flag.\n\nThe United States deploys aircraft carriers — massive warships that are crewed by thousands of sailors and which carry dozens of planes — in areas around the world.\n\nIn December, two US Navy pilots safely ejected after the F/A-18 warplane they were flying off the Truman was mistakenly shot down over the Red Sea by a US guided missile cruiser.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2025",
