  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar has said the province’s health sector has been freed from the influence of “pressure groups and union politics” and the department was now working on scientific basis to provide the best health facilities to the people.\n\nHe made these remarks while briefing assembly members on the health sector, alongside Secretary Mujeeb Panizai on Wednesday.\n\nThe opposition and treasury members said there should be no compromise on health issues and that male and female doctors should be available at their designated postings.\n\nThey minister emphasised that reforms in the health sector were ongoing, with three hospitals already established under public-private partnership. The government was working to establish four more hospitals under this model in various areas.\n\nMr Kakar clarified that certain elements have been spreading propaganda about selling off assets, but in reality, “steps are being taken under the public-private partnership model to provide better healthcare facilities to the public”.\n\nHe said the the three hospitals now operating under the partnership model were providing services, with both male and female doctors available, particularly in areas where doctors were not willing to work previously.\n\nMr Kakar claimed no medical equipment was purchased in the past seven to eight years. However, the current government is “committed to modernising all government hospitals”.\n\nMr Kakar and Mr Panizai said that currently, 1,488 health centres exist in Balochistan, where 7,500 doctors and other staff members are working.\n\nHowever, 13,000 posts for doctors and other staff were vacant due to pending promotion cases.\n\nThe said the health department was facing an acute shortage of human resources, and by 2030, Balochistan will need 8,000 nurses to meet the healthcare demand.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2025",
