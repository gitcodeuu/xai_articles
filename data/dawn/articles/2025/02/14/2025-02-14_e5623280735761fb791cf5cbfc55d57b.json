Long-planned cooperation on nuclear energy, also discussed by the leaders, faces ongoing legal challenges.\n\n“We’re also paving the way to ultimately provide India with the F-35 stealth fighters,” said Trump.\n\nMisri, the Indian official, later said the F-35 deal was a proposal at this point, with no formal process underway. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on any deal.\n\nAlthough Trump had a warm relationship with Modi in his first term, he again said on Thursday that India’s tariffs were “very high” and promised to match them, even after his earlier levies on steel and aluminium hit metal-producing India particularly hard.\n\n“We are being reciprocal with India,” Trump said during the press conference. “Whatever India charges, we charge them.”\n\nModi vowed to protect India’s interests.\n\n“One thing that I deeply appreciate, and I learn from President Trump, is that he keeps the national interest supreme,” Modi said. “Like him, I also keep the national interest of India at the top of everything else.”\n\nThe two leaders praised each other and agreed to deepen security cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, a thinly veiled reference to competition with China, as well as to start joint production on technologies like artificial intelligence.\n\nAsked before the meeting about the steps India was taking, one source described it as a “gift” for Trump designed to lower trade tensions. A Trump aide said that the president sees defence and energy sales to India lowering the US trade deficit.\n\nIndia’s energy purchases from the US could go up to $25 billion in the near future from $15bn last year, India’s Misri said, adding that this could contribute to reducing the trade deficit.\n\nTariffs will continue to dominate the two countries’ relationship, said Richard Rossow, head of the India program at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, a think tank.\n\n“It’s going to be a boxing match,” he said. “India is willing to take a few hits, but there’s a limit.” The US has a $45.6bn trade deficit with India. Overall, the US trade-weighted average tariff rate has been about 2.2 per cent, according to World Trade Organisation data, compared with India’s 12pc.\n\nTrump wants more help from India on unauthorised immigration. India is a major source of immigrants to the United States, including a large number in the tech industry on work visas and others in the US illegally.\n\nThe joint statement said the two countries agreed to aggressively address illegal immigration and human trafficking by strengthening law enforcement cooperation.\n\nIndia may prove critical to Trump’s strategy to thwart China, which many in his administration see as the top US rival. India is wary of neighbouring China’s military buildup and competes for many of the same markets.\n\nModi also worries that Trump could cut a deal with China that excludes India, according to Mukesh Aghi, president of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum lobbying group.\n\nIndia has continued its ties with Russia as it carries out its war with Ukraine. India has remained a major consumer of Russian energy, for instance, while the West has worked to cut its own consumption since the war started.\n\n“The world had this thinking that India somehow is a neutral country in this whole process,” said Modi. “But this is not true. India has a side, and that side is of peace.”",
