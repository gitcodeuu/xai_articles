  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The district administration has asked the Awami National Party to hold its gathering in Sangjani, as it declined a request by the political party to organise a gathering at Liaquat Bagh on Friday due to an alleged security threat to the ANP leadership.\n\nThe District Intelligence Committee (DIC) requested the ANP leaders to hold their public meeting at Faisal Hills Cricket Stadium near Sangjani instead of Liaquat Bagh.\n\nA senior official told Dawn there were two options for alternative sites: Bhatta Chowk and Sangjani, but the DIC recommended the ANP Sangjani for its gathering.\n\nHe said the ANP was assured that all facilities would be provided, but they rejected the offer.\n\nHe said that ANP leaders were informed about the DIC report and they sought time to consult party leadership. However, they held a press conference at the National Press Club instead.\n\nParty spokesperson takes offence, says new date for meeting to be announced soon\n\nIn its press conference, the ANP lambasted the PML-N government for its refusal to allow them to congregate in the garrison city.\n\nSpeaking at the National Press Club, ANP spokesperson Engineer Ehsanullah Khan said that they were not “bound by anyone’s permission to hold public meetings” as per the Constitution of Pakistan.\n\nFlanked by Senator Haji Hidayatullah, ANP Punjab President Manzoor Ahmed Khan, Abdul Rahim Wazir Advocate and others, the ANP spokesman said, “Why is our way being blocked at Liaquat Bagh? We are people who follow peace and law. We do not believe in violence and do not accept authoritarian rule.”\n\nHe said despite security threats, they held rallies in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Sindh, but they were not given permission to hold their public meeting in Punjab.\n\n“An application was submitted to the administration two weeks ago for a public meeting at Liaquat Bagh, Rawalpindi, on February 14. But, on February 13, we were informed that the public meeting could not be held due to security reasons. We strongly condemn this action of the Punjab government. It is the government’s job to maintain law and order,” he said.\n\n“We will definitely hold a public meeting at Liaquat Bagh and a new date will be announced after a consultation with party leaders,” Engineer Ehsanullah Khan said.\n\nHe further said that the public meetings were being held across the country to mobilise the people for the party manifesto, adding that a public meeting was held in Karachi last month.\n\n“We strongly condemn this action of the Punjab government,” he said, accusing the PML-N of duplicity.\n\n“We want Aimal Wali Khan to lead a rally at Liaquat Bagh. Our path is being blocked. Is the Constitution completely suspended in Pakistan? If they suppress the voice of the people, there will be repercussions,” he said, claiming that Pashtuns were being harassed under the guise of action against Afghan refugees.\n\nHe also said that ANP condemned the Peca law and expressed solidarity with journalists. “We condemn this behaviour of the Punjab government and the federal government to introduce anti-journalist laws,” he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2025",
