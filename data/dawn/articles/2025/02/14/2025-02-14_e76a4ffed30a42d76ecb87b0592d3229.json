We tried to get them back on track.”\n\nNew history books have expunged dozens of poems, speeches and articles penned by Mujib, alongside images of his daughter.\n\nThey instead now valorise the hundreds of people killed in the protests that ultimately toppled Hasina last summer while bringing back from exile other previously erased heroes of Bangladesh’s early history.\n\nAmong them is former army chief Ziaur Rahman — no relation to Mujib — credited with issuing the first public proclamation of Bangladesh’s independence during the 1971 war.\n\nZia had been left out of the curriculum during Hasina’s time because he founded the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), her chief opposition.\n\nHis return to the page augurs the resurgence of the political force he created, which is strongly favoured to win elections expected by next year.\n\nWhile the overhaul of Bangladesh’s official history gives clues as to the country’s future direction, critics say the new curriculum has its own litany of omissions.\n\nOf particular contention is one of the country’s darkest chapters — the murderous purge of its intellectual elite in the final days of the 1971 war.\n\nBangladesh’s main party Jamaat-e-Islami, which at the time opposed the country’s independence, helped orchestrate these killings.\n\nRevised textbooks mention that militia groups were responsible for the murders, without mentioning that the militias were run by Jamaat.\n\nThe omission is significant because Jamaat — another party suppressed by Hasina’s government — is likely to be a major force in Bangladesh’s next parliament, and has governed in the past in coalition with the BNP.\n\nDhaka University professor Mujibur Rahman — no relation to the independence leader — told AFP that the apparently deliberate attempt to obscure details around the purge raised questions about the reasons behind the changes.\n\n“The real question is whether this interim government wants students to learn the actual history,” he added.\n\nAsked about the changes, Hassan said that the textbook commission he helms did not want to trap the nation’s youth “in an endless cycle of hatred”.\n\n“At some point, we need to start reconciliation,” he added. “Should we make our textbooks flooded with hatred? How rational would it be?”\n\nOther signs suggest the new textbooks have conceded several changes to hardline religious sentiment in the Muslim-majority nation.\n\nHasina’s government, for all its other shortcomings on rights issues, was lauded for championing the rights of Bangladesh’s transgender community.\n\nThe new textbooks excise references to transgender Bangladeshis, a demand long held by religious groups.\n\nHassan acknowledged that the decision had been taken following objections from a Muslim group campaigning against representations of transgender issues in the curriculum.\n\n“We took their concerns into account,” he said, “and made adjustments accordingly to minimise their anxiety.”",
