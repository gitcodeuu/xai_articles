  "content": "KABUL: A suicide bomber killed one person and wounded three in an attack near government offices in Kabul on Thursday, an official spokesman said, the second explosion in Afghanistan this week. The attacker was also killed.\n\nSecurity guards had identified him and shot him as he approached the intended target, the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing, detonating the explosives, the Interior Ministry said.\n\nNo group has taken responsibility for the attack, which took place in a busy part of the capital housing administrative and government offices, and foreign embassies including the US Embassy. That site has been vacant since American and other foreign forces withdrew from the country in 2021.\n\nThis attack is the second this week after a suicide bomber detonated explosives strapped to his body outside a bank in northeastern Afghanistan on Tuesday, killing at least five people.\n\nFighters from the Afghan branches of the militant Islamic State group have waged an insurgency against the Taliban since they returned to power.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2025",
