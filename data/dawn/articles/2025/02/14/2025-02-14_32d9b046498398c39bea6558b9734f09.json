They demanded a retake of grades 5 and 8 exams.\n\nMeanwhile, the police arrested activist Raja Abid from Chilas for holding the protest.\n\nDespite his arrest, Mr Abid vowed to continue his protest for “better educational opportunities and ensuring access to quality education for students in remote areas of GB”.\n\nFollowing the protests, GB Chief Secretary Abrar Ahmad Mirza took notice of the results and directed the region’s education ministry to form a committee to improve education standards.\n\nAccording to a statement, the committee of experts will make recommendations to improve teaching standards, assessment, and training processes in public schools.\n\nThis team comprises teachers, educators and assessment experts who will work to improve the primary and elementary education sector in GB.\n\nThe team will conduct a detailed analysis of the curriculum, assessment procedures and training programmes to improve the quality of teachers, their development and the use of modern assessment methods.\n\nIn a press conference on Thursday, GB Education Minister Ghulam Shahzad Agha said the poor results were “disappointing”.\n\nHe said a high-level investigation was being conducted to identify those responsible for the poor performance of public school students.\n\nMr Agha told Dawn that the region’s education department faced multiple issues, including the shortage of teachers, inadequate facilities, and poor infrastructure.\n\n“There is no centralised system to make a unified policy for education,” he claimed.\n\nHe also opposed the chief secretary’s decision to appoint deputy commissioners (DC) to monitor school performance.\n\nThe minister said it would be an “insult for education officers in each district to be monitored by a DC, who are lower ranked officers.\n\nHe said the performance of schools should be evaluated by education experts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2025",
