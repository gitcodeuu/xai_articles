Speaking to reporters at the White House on Thursday, Trump said the war in Ukraine has to end.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader made the comments at a nuclear plant on his way to the Munich Security Conference. “We, as an independent country, simply will not be able to accept any agreements without us,” Zelensky told reporters.\n\n“Today it’s important that everything does not go according to Putin’s plan, in which he wants to do everything to make his negotiations bilateral (with the US),” Zelensky said, adding that it was important for the US and Ukraine to draw up a plan to end the war before talking to the Russian side.\n\n‘No betrayal’\n\nAfter a 90-minute phone call with Putin, his first since returning to power, Trump said he expected to meet the\n\nRussian leader in Saudi Arabia for Ukraine peace talks — sparking fears Kyiv would be frozen out.\n\nThat came after his administration poured cold water on Ukraine’s goals of reclaiming all its territory and pushing to join Nato’s protective umbrella.\n\n“There is no betrayal there. There is a recognition that the whole world and the United States is invested and interested in peace,” Hegseth said at Nato.\n\n“That will require both sides recognising things they don’t want to,” added the US defence secretary.\n\nTrump, who has been pushing for a quick end to the war, denied that Ukraine was being excluded from direct negotiations between the two nuclear-armed superpowers.\n\nThe Kremlin said both leaders had agreed the “time has come to work together,” insisting it wanted to organise a face-to-face meeting promptly and that broader European security should be on the agenda.\n\nThe Kremlin said it was impressed by Trump’s position on ending the war in Ukraine, and that preparations were under way for a meeting between Trump and Putin. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the call was very important and that there was political will on both the Russian and US sides to find a settlement and end the war.\n\nAfter speaking to Putin, the US president called Zelensky and shared details of his talks with the Kremlin leader.\n\nUkraine’s defence minister Rustem Umerov told Kyiv’s Nato backers “we’re continuing, we’re strong, we’re capable, we’re able, we will deliver”.\n\nKyiv’s European backers are terrified that Trump could force Ukraine into a bad peace deal that will leave them facing an emboldened Putin — while fronting the lion’s share of costs for post-war security.\n\nNato chief Mark Rutte on Thursday said it was crucial that Kyiv was “closely involved” in any talks about what happens in Ukraine.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2025",
