They don’t have any open injury. Most (likely died from) hypoxia or maybe some blunt injury but that would only be confirmed after an autopsy,” Dr Ritu Saxena, deputy medical superintendent of Lok Nayak Hospital in New Delhi told AFP.\n\n“There are also 11 others who are injured. Most of them are stable and have orthopaedic injuries,” she said.\n\nBroadcaster NDTV reported three more dead from the stampede quoting an official of another hospital in the city. The death toll included five children, media reports said, citing the Press Trust of India news agency.\n\nThe youngest of the victims was seven years old and the oldest 79, according to multiple media outlets, citing a list provided by police. All but four of the 18 people named were female.\n\nMedia showed images and videos of crowds of people falling over each other after the incident, as police and relief teams worked to try and ease the congestion.\n\nAtishi, the chief minister of the national capital territory and who goes by only one name, said on X that many of the victims were pilgrims who were going to attend the Kumbh Mela.\n\n“I have been working as a coolie since 1981, but I never saw a crowd like this before,” the Times of India newspaper quoted a porter at the railway station as saying.\n\n“People started colliding and fell on the escalator and stairs” when the platform for a special train departing for Prayagraj was suddenly shifted, the porter said.\n\n“There was a sea of humanity at the railway station, and the crowd surged towards the train going to Prayagraj,” a distraught woman told the India Today news channel. “I lost my belongings and barely survived.”\n\nRailways minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said a “high-level inquiry” had been ordered into the causes of the accident.\n\nVaishnaw said additional special trains were being run from New Delhi to clear the rush of devotees.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi said he was “distressed” by the stampede.\n\n“My thoughts are with all those who have lost their loved ones. I pray that the injured have a speedy recovery,” he wrote on X.\n\nThe governor of the capital territory Delhi, Vinai Kumar Saxena said disaster management personnel had been told to deploy and “all hospitals are in readiness to address related exigencies.”\n\nThe six-week Kumbh Mela is the single biggest milestone on the Hindu religious calendar, and officials said around 500 million devotees have already visited the festival since it began last month.\n\nMore than 400 people died after they were trampled or drowned on a single day of the festival in 1954, one of the largest tolls in a crowd-related disaster globally.\n\nAnother 36 people were crushed to death in 2013, the last time the festival was staged in Prayagraj.",
