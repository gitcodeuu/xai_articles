Among them was a woman with her baby on her back.”\n\nA local official confirmed the cave-in, while the Kenieba gold miners’ association also put the death toll at 48.\n\nThe accident took place near the town of Kenieba in Mali’s gold-rich Kayes region, Taoule Camara, Secretary General of the National Union of Gold Counters and Refineries (UCROM), told Reuters.\n\nThe women had climbed down into open-pit areas left by industrial miners to look for scraps of gold when the earth collapsed around them, he said.\n\nThe search for victims was ongoing, the head of an environmental organisation told AFP.\n\nSaturday’s accident took place at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, sources told AFP.\n\nIn January, a landslide at a gold mine in southern Mali killed at least 10 people and left many others missing, most of them women.\n\nJust over a year ago, a tunnel collapsed at a gold mining site in the same region as Saturday’s landslide, killing more than 70 people.",
