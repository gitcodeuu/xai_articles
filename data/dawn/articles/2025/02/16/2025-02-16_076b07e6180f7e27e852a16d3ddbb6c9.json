Separately, a senior lawyer and his brother were shot dead by unidentified assailants in the Gulkada area of Saidu Sharif.\n\nMost recently, a 65-year-old Afghan national was shot dead in Karachi’s Baldia-8 on Wednesday evening.\n\nSaeedabad SHO Idris Bangash said that Allauddin was reciting the Holy Quran after offering prayer inside a mosque in the area when someone phoned him. As he went out of the mosque to answer the phone, two suspects riding a motorcycle shot him and fled.\n\nHe suffered critical injuries and was shifted to the Dr Ruth Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi where doctors pronounced him dead. The officer suspected some personal enmity behind the incident.",
