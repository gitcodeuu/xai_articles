The cabinet was informed that in the original bill, it was stated that a cadre officer selected as vice chancellor must resign from civil service. The standing committee amended this to specify that the officer must either resign or seek retirement from service, depending on the individual case which the assembly also passed.\n\nIt was also pointed out in the meeting that the original bill did not specify an age limit. However, the standing committee amendment established that general candidates must be under 62 years of age, retired high court judges must be under 63, and retired Supreme Court judges must be under 67, which the assembly passed.\n\nSindh Civil Courts (Amendment) Bill\n\nThe cabinet was told that a recent amendment bill passed by the assembly had been returned by the governor with observation regarding the jurisdiction of the Sindh High Court.\n\nThe governor expressed reservations, citing Article 175(2) of the Constitution of Pakistan, which states that courts can only exercise jurisdiction conferred by law.\n\nAfter thorough discussion, the cabinet asserted that the proposed Bill of 2025 did not violate Article 175 of the Constitution. “The bill aligns with the Sindh Civil Courts Ordinance, 1962, which has been amended multiple times without prior objections.”\n\nThe cabinet further argued that the backlog of cases at the SHC is overwhelming, with only a few benches hearing civil suits. In contrast, district courts have a larger pool of judges, which could facilitate quicker resolutions. The judgment in C.P. No. 5913 of 2018 (Ghulam Asghar Pathan case) also highlighted the excessive burden on the SHC and recommended redistributing caseloads.\n\nThe cabinet approved the bill and referred it to the assembly for necessary action.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 16th, 2025",
