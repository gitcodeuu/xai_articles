It will help us improve cleanliness in these schemes,” said LDA DG Tahir Farooq while speaking on the occasion. He said the sustainable development models were being implemented in the LDA schemes.\n\nLahore DC Syed Musa Raza emphasized that the LWMC would deploy its teams in multiple shifts as ensuring cleanliness in Lahore was a top priority.
