It came days after Tehran fired hundreds of missiles and drones at the former in retaliation for a deadly strike at its embassy in Syria.\n\nThanking Rubio for “unequivocal backing” for Israel’s policy in Gaza, Netanyahu said Israel and the United States under President Donald Trump shared a common strategy in the Palestinian enclave, where a fragile ceasefire is in effect between Israel and Hamas after 15 months of bombardment.\n\n“I want to assure everyone who’s now listening to us, President Trump and I are working in full cooperation and coordination between us,” he said.\n\nRubio added: “Hamas can not continue as a military or government force and as long as it stands as a force that can govern or administer or a force that can threaten by use of violence, peace becomes impossible.”\n\nThe display of Rubio and Netanyahu’s unified stance on the Middle East came after Tel Aviv received a shipment of heavy MK-84 bombs from the US, the defence ministry said today.\n\nThe development came after Trump lifted a block imposed on the export of those munitions by the administration of his predecessor Joe Biden.\n\nThe MK-84 is an unguided 907-kilogramme (2,000-pound) bomb, which can rip through thick concrete and metal, creating a wide blast radius.\n\nThe Biden administration declined to clear them for export to Israel out of concern about the impact on densely populated areas of the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe Biden administration sent thousands of 907kg bombs to Israel after the Oct 7, 2023 attack by Hamas but later held up one of the shipments. The hold was lifted by Trump last month.\n\n“The munitions shipment that arrived in Israel tonight, released by the Trump Administration, represents a significant asset for the Air Force and the IDF and serves as further evidence of the strong alliance between Israel and the United States,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said late on Saturday.\n\nThe shipment arrived after days of concern about whether a fragile ceasefire in Gaza agreed upon last month would hold, after both sides accused each other of violating the terms of the deal to halt fighting to allow the exchange of hostages held in Gaza for Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israeli jails.\n\nAccording to a study reported in October 2024, Washington has announced assistance for Israel worth at least $17.9 billion since the recent Gaza conflict began.",
