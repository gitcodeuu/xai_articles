  "content": "WASHINGTON: A US judge issued an emergency order early Saturday blocking Elon Musk’s government reform team from accessing personal and financial data for millions of Americans stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.\n\nUS District Judge Paul A. Engelmayer’s order restricts giving access to Treasury Department payment systems and other data to “all political appointees, special government employees, and government employees detailed from an agency outside the Treasury Department.”\n\nThe temporary restrictive order, which remains in effect until a Feb 14 hearing, also says any such person who has accessed data from the Treasury Department’s records since President Donald Trump’s Jan 20 inauguration must “immediately destroy any and all copies of material downloaded.”\n\nMusk, the world’s richest person, is leading Trump’s federal cost-cutting efforts under the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The case was brought against the Republican president, the Department of the Treasury and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent by attorneys general from 19 states on Friday.\n\nThey alleged the administration violated the law by expanding access to sensitive Treasury Department data to staff from Musk’s DOGE. The Tesla, SpaceX and X chief is neither a federal employee nor a government official, although US media reported this month that he had been registered as a “special government employee.”\n\nDOGE does not enjoy full status as a government department, which would require approval by Congress. But Musk, a top Trump donor and ally, and his team have rampaged through federal agencies in the first weeks of the new administration, pausing foreign aid programmes, slashing budgets and attempting to lay off scores of government workers.\n\n‘Unfettered access’\n\nJudge Engelmayer’s order early Saturday said the states that sued would “face irreparable harm in the absence of injunctive relief.” “That is both because of the risk that the new policy presents of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking,” he wrote.\n\nMusk ran into controversy last week with reports he and his team were accessing sensitive data stored at the Treasury Department.\n\nAn internal assessment from the Treasury called the DOGE team’s access to federal payment systems “the single biggest insider threat the Bureau of the Fiscal Service (BFS) has ever faced,” US media reported. The lawsuit from states including New York and California alleged that the Trump administration granted “virtually unfettered access” to BFS payment systems to “at least one 25-year-old DOGE associate” who had the “authority to view or modify numerous critical files.”\n\nThat access “poses huge cybersecurity risks, including risks to States and States’ residents that their information will be used and processed, unchecked, in a manner not permitted by federal law,” says the states’ lawsuit filed in the US District Court in Manhattan late on Friday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
