  "content": "Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and a top advisor to US President Donald Trump, said he has no interest in acquiring social media platform TikTok’s operations in the United States, in comments released on Saturday.\n\n“I’ve not put in a bid for TikTok and I don’t have any plans for what I would do if I had TikTok,” said Musk in comments made via video link at a German forum in late January that were released on the weekend.\n\nTikTok is facing a US law that ordered the company to break off from its Chinese owner ByteDance or otherwise be banned in the United States over national security concerns regarding the data it gathers on users.\n\nIn one of his first acts in office, Trump ordered a pause on enforcing the law that should have seen TikTok effectively made illegal in the country a day before he took office for a second term.\n\nSoon after, Trump said he would be open to Musk — the owner of social media platform X, Tesla and a slew of other companies — buying the platform.\n\nMusk, however, said he did not wish to acquire the company.\n\n“I don’t use TikTok personally, so, you know, I’m not that familiar with it,” he said. “I’m not chomping at the bit to acquire TikTok.”\n\nMusk bought social media giant Twitter, which he renamed X, for $44 billion in 2022, insisting he was doing so in order to safeguard “free speech”.\n\nSince his takeover, rights campaigners warn there has been a spike in hate speech and disinformation on the platform.\n\nMusk was one of Trump’s main financial backers in his presidential campaign, and is heading the US president’s budget-slashing initiatives.\n\nHis so-called “Department of Government Efficiency” (Doge) has targeted a range of federal government agencies and regulators, with the apparent intent of shutting them down and firing staff, especially those not in line with Trump’s political agenda.\n\nOn Saturday, a US judge issued an emergency order blocking Musk’s government reform team from accessing personal and financial data for millions of Americans stored at the Treasury Department, court documents showed.\n\nIn the comments at the forum in Germany, Musk also took aim at Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives, which are meant to support historically oppressed and disenfranchised communities.\n\n“DEI is simply racism rebranded,” he said. “I’m against racism and sexism no matter who it’s directed against.”\n\nUS officials have been racing to enact Trump’s war on DEI across the federal bureaucracy — dismantling training initiatives, scrapping grants and sidelining hundreds of workers.\n\nIn Germany, Musk has voiced firm support for the far-right anti-immigration AfD party — a political taboo in a country whose Nazi past remains a sensitive subject.",
