  "content": "LONDON: Kevin De Bruyne spared Manchester City’s blushes as they came from behind to beat third tier Leyton Orient 2-1 in the FA Cup fourth round, while Southampton’s miserable season hit a new low with an embarrassing exit against Burnley on Saturday.\n\nPep Guardiola’s troubled side were rocked when Jamie Donley’s long-range effort came back off the bar and rebounded in off City goalkeeper Stefan Ortega to give Orient an early lead at Brisbane Road.\n\nCity finally drew level after 56 minutes when Uzbekistan defender Abdukodir Khusanov deflected in Rico Lewis’s shot for his first Manchester City goal since signing from Lens in the January transfer window.\n\nGuardiola had to turn to his bench more than he would have liked just four days before a mammoth Champions League play-off round first leg against Real Madrid.\n\nBut the introduction of De Bruyne made the difference as the Belgian midfielder scored 11 minutes from time.\n\n“It was a typical FA Cup game, that is why this competition is unbelievable. For the fans, how the crowd support and we knew they are strong,” Guardiola said. “It is my ninth season in England. I played many times against lower division teams. It was a tight game and we knew it for the situation that we have, but we reacted really well with great character.”\n\nVictory came at a cost for City, though, as new midfielder Nico Gonzalez hobbled off just 22 minutes into his debut after a 50 million ($62 million) move from Porto.\n\nBottom of the Premier League and seemingly destined for relegation, Southampton got no respite in the FA Cup as second tier Burnley won 1-0 at St Mary’s.\n\nScott Parker’s team went in front after 77 minutes when Marcus Edwards scored from close-range on his debut after signing on loan from Sporting Lisbon.\n\nThe last FA Cup tie at Goodison Park ended in disappointment for Everton, who are moving to a new stadium next season, as Bournemouth cruised to a 2-0 victory.\n\nAndoni Iraola’s side went ahead when Everton captain James Tarkowski fouled Antoine Semenyo in the area and the Bournemouth winger picked himself up to convert the 23rd minute penalty.\n\nDan Jebbison tapped in Bournemouth’s second on the rebound after Marcus Tavernier’s shot was parried by Jordan Pickford in the 42nd minute.\n\nRodrigo Muniz scored twice as Fulham won 2-1 at third tier Wigan Athletic.\n\nMuniz bundled home Ryan Sessegnon’s cross in the 23rd minute before Jonny Smith’s curler hauled Wigan level after 50 minutes.\n\nFulham were back in front five minutes later when Muniz slotted home from Andreas Pereira’s pass.\n\nIpswich Town, second bottom of the Premier League, swept to a 4-1 win against Frank Lampard’s Coventry City.\n\nGeorge Hirst’s second minute penalty was quickly cancelled by out Joel Latibeaudiere’s eighth minute equaliser for the second tier hosts.\n\nBut Jack Clarke restored Ipswich’s lead in the 28th minute and struck again after 37 minutes before Jaden Philogene’s 63rd minute effort sealed the rout.\n\nMillwall reached the fifth round for the first time since 2018-19 thanks to Femi Azeez’s double in a 2-0 win at Championship leaders Leeds United.\n\nLeeds boss Daniel Farke made 10 changes and paid the price as Azeez opened the scoring with a deflected effort from the edge of the area in the 30th minute.\n\nAzeez netted again for the 2004 FA Cup finalists with a fierce drive in the 55th minute before Millwall keeper Liam Roberts saved Pascal Struijk’s penalty.\n\nOn Friday, Manchester United clawed back from a goal down to beat Leicester City in a 2-1 at Old Trafford thanks to a last-gasp header from veteran defender Harry Maguire plus a strike from Joshua Zirkzee.\n\nBobby De Cordova-Reid headed in a rebound put Premier League strugglers Leicester ahead in the 42nd minute but United levelled in the 68th minute when Rasmus Hojlund’s effort was blocked by defender Caleb Okoli and the ball fell perfectly for Zirkzee to tap home.\n\nThe game appeared to be heading into extra time before Maguire headed in the winner in the 93rd minute from Bruno Fernandes’ free kick, seconds before the final whistle.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
