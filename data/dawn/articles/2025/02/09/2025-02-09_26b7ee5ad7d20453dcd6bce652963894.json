Resultantly, the instant bail petition is hereby dismissed,” the court ruled.\n\nThe FIR of the alleged occurrence was registered at Hayatabad police station under section 295-B (defiling of copy of the Holy Quran) of Pakistan Penal Code on Jan 30, 2025.\n\nThe accused is charged with throwing copies of the Holy Quran in a dustbin near Hayatabad police station.\n\nComplainant in the FIR was ASI Tariqullah, who said that a video had gone viral on social media about the occurrence after which they had started an inquiry on Jan 24 by registering the case in a daily diary.\n\nHe stated that subsequently the suspect was traced and he admitted that he had thrown copies of the Holy Quran in the bin.\n\nAn official at Hayatabad Police station, who didn’t want to be named, said that apparently the act of the suspect was not intentional. However, he added even if he had no intention of desecration of the Holy Quran, his act couldn’t be condoned.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
