  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Environ­mental samples collected from 21 districts have confirmed the presence of wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) in those areas.\n\nThe samples were collec­ted from Muzaffarabad, Dera Bugti, Hub, Khuzdar, Noshki, Nasirabad, Usta Moh­ammad, Zhob, Las­bela, Islamabad, Charsa­dda, Peshawar, Swabi, Tank, Bahawalpur, D.G. Khan, Jhang, Lahore, Multan, Rahimyar Khan and Karachi East, according to an official of the Regional Reference Labo­r­atory for Polio Eradi­cation at the National Institute of Health (NIH).\n\nLast week, environmental samples from 26 tested positive for WPV1.\n\nPositive sewage samples indicate the presence of pol­i­ovirus in the area, putting children at risk of contracting the crippling disease.\n\nPakistan is one of the last two countries in the world, alongside Afghanis­tan, where polio remains endemic.\n\nAccording to officials, Pakistan has been res­ponding to a “significant re­­­surgence of WPV1”.\n\n“Last year, the country reported 73 cases of the disease. Of these, 27 are from Ba­­lochistan, 22 from Khyber Pakh­tunkhwa, 22 from Sindh and one each from Punjab and Islam­abad,” he added.\n\nDespite global efforts to eradicate the virus, challenges such as security issues, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation have slowed progress.\n\nThis year’s first nationwide polio vaccination campaign, which started earlier this week, will end tomorrow (Monday).\n\nLast month, global experts and organisations working on polio eradication met federal and provincial government officials in Islam­abad to review the eradication programme.\n\nThe three-day meeting of the Technical Advisory Group brought together experts from the WHO, Unicef, CDC, Gates Foundation, Rotary International, Gavi, and USAID, according to the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme.\n\nThe meeting reiterated the commitment to polio eradication. It said adequate supp­ort for polio teams and full immunisation coverage, especially in the most affected areas, were crucial to eradicating polio in 2025.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
