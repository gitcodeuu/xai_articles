  "content": "BATTAGRAM: Scarcity of substantial rain and snowfall in the Battagram district during the current winter season has created a drought-like situation, residents complained.\n\nThey said this period was previously distinguished by peak rainfall and snowfall, which typically replenished water levels throughout the year, thereby ensuring a steady supply of potable water.\n\nThe people are heavily reliant on natural springs, streams and wells for their daily water requirements, which encompass drinking, cooking and other mundane purposes. However, the dearth of rainfall and snowfall has raised concerns about the sustainability of these natural water sources. Historically, snow during winter remained on the mountaintops until late May or June, thereby maintaining groundwater levels and ensuring a steady supply of water throughout the year.\n\nRegrettably, this year’s winter season has been unusually dry, with only minimal snowfall on the mountain peaks, while lower-lying areas received no snowfall – a phenomenon unprecedented in the district’s history. This has sparked fears among locals about the impending water scarcity, which could have far-reaching consequences for the district’s inhabitants.\n\nResidents attribute phenomenon to widespread deforestation\n\nAdnan Khan, a social activist, said the prolonged dry spell could trigger water scarcity in the district. He emphasised that the district’s reliance on natural springs and wells made them vulnerable to drought, which could exacerbate the water crisis. Ghaffar Mohammad, another resident, recounted that the district had never experienced a winter without rainfall or snowfall.\n\nThe traditional practice of women fetching water from nearby natural springs, which previously flowed throughout the year, is now under threat. The prospect of these natural water sources drying up has sent shockwaves throughout the district, prompting concerns about the future sustainability of the area’s water resources.\n\nAman Khan, a resident of Battagram, articulated his apprehensions to Dawn, emphasising the district’s reliance on rainfall and snowmelt for agricultural purposes, given its mountainous geography. “The absence of irrigation channels renders crops entirely dependent on natural water sources. However, the current dry spell threatens to devastate wheat crops, fruits, and vegetables, which are cultivated locally to meet the district’s needs.”\n\nHazrat Gul, an elderly resident, reminisced about the past, when snowfall was a regular occurrence in lower-lying areas, including bazaars and villages. However, he noted that snowfall was now largely confined to the mountaintops, and even that was dwindling. He attributed this phenomenon to widespread deforestation, which has denuded the mountains of their forest cover. “This, in turn, has led to a rise in temperature, culminating in the current drought-like situation.”\n\nResident Anas Ali echoed similar concerns, stating that the district’s rivers and streams, which were previously perennial, were now at risk of drying up due to inadequate rainfall and snowfall. He noted that the wells dug by residents to access clean drinking water would also be affected as the water table drops precipitously.\n\nFatima Bibi, an elderly woman from Battagram village, lamented the disappearance of leafy greens (Saag) from the fields, which were normally harvested by women and young girls during this time of the year. “The absence of rainfall has rendered the fields dry and dusty, depriving the community of this essential crop.”\n\n“Young girls would often make excursions to these fields in groups, reveling in the joy of plucking fresh leafy greens for culinary purposes,” she added.\n\nThe ramifications of this drought are far-reaching, with potential consequences for the district’s food security and economic stability.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
