But Riyadh rebuffed his statements, saying it would not establish ties with Israel without the creation of a Palestinian state.\n\nGaza authorities say the bombardment has killed more than 47,000 of the nearly 2 million Palestinians who live there.\n\nIsrael launched its offensive after Hamas fighters killed some 1,200 people and seized more than 250 as hostages in an October 7, 2023, attack, according to Israeli tallies.\n\nIn a separate statement, the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) also “strongly condemned” Netanyahu’s statement.\n\nGCC Secretary-General Jasem Mohamed Albudaiwi said in a statement that “these dangerous and irresponsible statements confirm the approach of the Israeli occupation forces in their lack of respect for international laws and treaties, as well as the sovereignty of nations”.\n\nHe affirmed the “firm and steadfast position of the Kingdom and the GCC countries in supporting the Palestinian people in obtaining their legitimate rights and the significant and valuable efforts exerted by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the GCC countries in regional and international forums to support the Palestinian cause”.\n\nThe official also renewed his call on the international community “to seriously and decisively stand against these aggressive Israeli statements, which pose a threat and danger to the security and stability of the region and the world at large”.",
