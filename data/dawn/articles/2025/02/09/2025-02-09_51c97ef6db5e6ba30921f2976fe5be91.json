They told the media that Constable Osama’s bike had hit Waqas’ motorbike and he had him and his two other friends arrested because of this issue.\n\nWaqas was then subjected to “torture” and when he died the police quietly released his two friends.\n\nThe victim was a shopkeeper in a mobile market in Saddar and his colleagues also joined the protest by suspending their commercial activities.\n\nOn Saturday evening, an order issued by DIG Raza stated that Preedy SHO Pervez Solangi and eight other policemen were suspended and an inquiry had been initiated into their conduct in connection with the death of the shopkeeper.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
