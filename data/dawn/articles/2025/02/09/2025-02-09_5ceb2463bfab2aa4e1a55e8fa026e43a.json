It is flying into the wind,” he said, and pointed out how the “military bureaucracy” has penetrated and taken control of all power by using politicians as well as the judiciary, both of which have often let themselves be used.\n\nHe said that the “culture of resistance” in the country has weakened in recent years as the civil society and other stakeholders have stopped opposing the violations of the Constitution and oppressive decisions by the state and its institutions. And that has badly impacted the rule of law, he believed.\n\nHe said that Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah had envisioned a liberal, progressive and parliamentary system, but the country was turned into a garrison state.\n\nBarrister Salahuddin Ahmed also believed that the culture of resistance had diminished in the country.\n\nHe said the Constitution guarantees civilian supremacy but it has always been challenged by powerful institutions. Whenever any power elite got an opportunity, it misused the Constitution and disregarded it. And that includes the establishment, the judiciary as well as politicians who often try to present a “victim narrative”. The people need to challenge such violation of the Constitution, he said.\n\nLawyer Sara Malkani said the power elite itself, from day one, never accepted the restraints and arrangement of power structures defined in the Constitution for them and the people. That is why the Constitution has not been relevant to the people and their rights have been violated, she said.\n\nShe said one could look how other countries managed to maintain civilian supremacy despite challenges. “The best example is right next door,” she said, referring to how the Indian constitution has sustained for so long since it came into effect in 1950.\n\nLawyer Abid Zuberi said the 1973 Constitution had survived three martial laws but now it had been badly hit after the 26th Amendment, which had attacked the judiciary.\n\nHe said that the judiciary had been made weaker by parliament at the behest of the establishment. He questioned as to how civilian supremacy could be achieved in such a situation.\n\nFormer Sindh advocate general Barrister Zameer Ghumro, who is a Pakistan Peoples Party senator, tended to put more blame on judiciary and the ‘establishment’ for violating the Constitution and said politicians were not the only one to be criticised.\n\nHe said all the stakeholders misused laws and violated them and their mutual fight was often only about the procedure of how that was done and not about staying in constitutional limits.\n\nFurthermore, he said free and fair elections and a true federalism is the only solution to the problems in Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
