  "content": "QUETTA: The Green Kissan Ittehad (GKI) has strongly rejected the 35 per cent tax on agricultural production in Balochistan and across the country, imposed under the IMF’s directive, calling it a cruel and anti-farmer measure.\n\nAt a press conference, GKI President Agha Lal Jan Ahmadzai demanded that compensation be provided to farmers affected by the construction of the Quetta-Karachi Highway in Khuzdar, Kalat, Mangochar, Mastung, Surrab and other areas.\n\nHe said that 75pc of the population in Balochistan is associated with the agriculture sector, which supplies vegetables, fruits and other agricultural products to the entire country and contributes millions of rupees in taxes. Despite this, the agriculture sector is on the verge of collapse, he regretted.\n\nMr Ahmadzai criticised the performance of the Quetta Electric Supply Company, calling it highly disappointing. He likened their actions to the economic murder of farmers, contributing to the gradual decline in agricultural production capacity and the drying up of orchards.\n\nThe livestock sector is also struggling due to a lack of quality medicines and vaccinations, he said, calling for measures to prevent the use of substandard drugs and the provision of mobile dispensary services for livestock owners.\n\nHe also reiterated their commitment to the ongoing struggle against illegal trawling in the coastal areas of Balochistan.\n\nThe GKI president said that in other provinces, modern agricultural technology is being used to benefit farmers and landowners by providing high-quality seeds and training. However, he added, Balochistan has been deprived of these facilities, pushing the agriculture, livestock and fishing sectors to the brink of disaster. With little government support, farmers are forced to take their own initiatives to promote agriculture, he said.\n\nMr Ahmadzai stressed the need for a six-hour electricity supply until the solar energy transition is completed. He said that while the government allocates Rs2 million for extracting water up to 200-300 feet, this amount is insufficient for extracting water up to 1,200 feet, which he compared to “a pinch of salt in flour”.\n\nHe called for the introduction of training programmes and the issuance of farmer cards to Balochistan’s landowners, similar to those in Punjab, to help alleviate their difficulties.\n\nHe condemned the policy of extracting six additional canals from the Sindh River in Punjab, calling it an anti-Balochistan policy and an infringement on the rights of Balochistan’s farmers.\n\nMr Ahmadzai pledged to continue the struggle for the timely provision of water, barley and wheat purchases in the green belt and to address other issues affecting farmers and cultivators.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 9th, 2025",
