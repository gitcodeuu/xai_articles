  "content": "WASHINGTON: The United States said on Thursday that it opposed Israel’s strikes in Syria, a day after Washington helped broker a deal to end violence.\n\n“The United States did not support recent Israeli strikes,” State Department spokeswoman Tammy Bruce told reporters.\n\n“We are engaging diplomatically with Israel and Syria at the highest levels, both to address the present crisis and reach a lasting agreement between the two sovereign states,” she said.\n\nShe declined to say if the United States had expressed its displeasure with Israel or whether it would oppose future strikes on Syria.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio voiced concern when asked about the Israeli strikes, which included attacking the defence ministry in Damascus.\n\nFresh clashes rock Druze heartland\n\nHe later issued a statement that did not directly address the Israeli strikes, but voiced broader concern about the violence.\n\nIsrael said it was intervening on behalf of the Druze community after communal clashes.\n\nFresh clashes\n\nMeanwhile, Bedouin tribes and Druze fighters clashed again in the latter’s Sweida heartland on Friday, a day after the Syrian army withdrew under Israeli bombardment and diplomatic pressure.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",
