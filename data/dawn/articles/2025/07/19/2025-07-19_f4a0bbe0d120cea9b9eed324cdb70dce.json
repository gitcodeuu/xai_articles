It added that the JF-17C Block III represents Pakistan’s “advanced defence technology”.\n\n“This success has honoured Pakistan’s aviation sector on an international level.”\n\nPTV called the success at RIAT a “testament to the recognition of the capabilities of the Pakistan Air Force”.\n\nIn May, when Pakistan downed Indian jets as retaliation for late-night strikes during the Pakistan-India conflict, the PAF formally acknowledged a month later that it was the Kamra-based 15 Squadron that led the charge in shooting down them down.\n\nThe event is now considered one of the largest air-to-air engagements in South Asia in more than half a century.\n\n“There is a palpable sense of enthusiasm across the United Kingdom following the recent Pakistan-India conflict, as aviation enthusiasts and defence observers were eagerly looking forward to the arrival of the Pakistan Air Force’s JF-17 Thunder Block-III,” the statement said.\n\n“The aircraft’s combat-proven capabilities and operational excellence have garnered significant global attention, making its appearance at RIAT a highly anticipated highlight in the aerospace and defence community.”",
