In recent weeks, Israeli forces and contractors have levelled large swathes of Rafah.\n\nAn analysis of damage by academics Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek found the destruction in Gaza since April has been most concentrated in this area.\n\nIn July, Israel’s Defence Minister Israel Katz outlined plans to establish what he called a “humanitarian city” over the ruins of Rafah, with an initial 600,000 Palestinians being confined there.\n\nThe plan has been widely condemned. Former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told the BBC that the proposal would be “interpreted as being akin to a concentration camp”.\n\nAnalysts have suggested for quite some time that Israel has been attempting to create deep “buffer zones” by destroying buildings near to the border, but some of the areas flattened recently are deep into Gaza.\n\nBBC Verify said it presented the IDF with a list of places in which we documented demolitions and asked it to provide specific military justifications, but the IDF did not do so.\n\nThe report also identified dozens of adverts posted to Israeli Facebook groups, which were offering work in Gaza to demolition contractors. The majority of the posts have been shared by recruiters since May.\n\nMany of the ads specify areas of Gaza where the work will occur, such as “the Philadelphi Corridor” and “the Morag Axis” – both areas controlled by the IDF.\n\nInfrastructure demolition\n\nBBC Verify said it had identified footage of infrastructure being demolished in 40 locations since the ceasefire ended in March. Video footage shows schools — like a school in Tel al-Sultan — being levelled, along with residential and municipal buildings.\n\nTel al-Sultan was one of Rafah city’s most vibrant neighbourhoods. Its densely packed streets were home to Rafah’s only specialised maternity hospital and a centre caring for orphaned and abandoned children.\n\nSatellite images showed that much of the area had already been heavily damaged by Israeli bombing and artillery fire, but dozens of buildings had withstood the barrage.\n\nBut by July 13, the destruction had escalated, with even the shells of damaged buildings swept away and entire blocks torn to the ground. The hospital is one of a handful of buildings left standing.\n\nSimilarly, demolitions are now under way in the adjacent Saudi neighbourhood — once home to the city’s largest mosque and several schools.\n\nIsraeli demolitions are also visible in other parts of the strip which appear to have avoided heavy damage during earlier bombardments.\n\nThe farming town of Khuza’a is located about 1.5km (0.9 miles) from the Israeli border.\n\nBefore the war the town had a population of 11,000 people and was known for its fertile farmlands and crops such as tomatoes, wheat and olives. Satellite imagery from May shows many of the buildings in the town remain standing, but by mid-June, Khuza’a was largely razed by the Israeli forces.\n\nA similar story emerges in the nearby town of Abasan al-Kabira, where about 27,000 people lived before the war. Photos taken on 31 May and 8 July indicate that an extensive area was swept away in just 38 days.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",
