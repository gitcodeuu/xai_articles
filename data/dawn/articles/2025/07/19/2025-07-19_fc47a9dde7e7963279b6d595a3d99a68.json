  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan’s cotton crop is facing a serious crisis, with latest figures showing a sharp 32 per cent drop in arrivals at ginning factories nationwide compared to the same period last year, raising alarms for the economy and the crucial textile sector.\n\nAccording to data released by the Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association (PCGA) on Friday, only 297,751 cotton bales had reached ginning factories by July 15, down from 442,041 bales during the corresponding period last year.\n\nThe report presents a mixed picture across provinces. Punjab’s performance has been relatively better, with 145,101 bales received so far — a 27pc increase from last year. District-wise data shows improvement in several areas: Khanewal received 28,825 bales, Vehari 33,950, DG Khan 19,397, and Rajanpur 9,200 bales. Smaller quantities were recorded in Multan (3,700 bales), Faisalabad (3,037), and Layyah (3,970).\n\nHowever, Rahim Yar Khan reported just 15 bales, a drop of over 99pc. This drastic fall is largely attributed to the extensive cultivation of sugarcane, driven by the presence of six major sugar mills in the district.\n\nIn contrast, Sindh’s situation is bleak. The province reported 152,650 bales by mid-July, compared to 327,666 bales last year — a steep 53pc decline. Sanghar remained the leading district with 130,037 bales, less than half of last year’s tally. Other districts such as Mirpur Khas (5,100 bales), Nawabshah (1,100), and Jamshoro (1,500) showed minimal output, while several districts recorded no arrivals at all, reflecting a deepening production crisis.\n\nBalochistan also fared poorly, recording only 5,100 bales against 11,200 last year — a decline of over 54pc.\n\nCotton Ginners Forum Chairman Ihsan-ul-Haq highlighted discrepancies in production data. He noted that while the PCGA report showed 145,101 bales in Punjab as of July 15, the Crop Reporting Centre Punjab (CRCP) estimated production at 335,000 bales — 131pc higher. Of these, 84,000 bales were attributed to North and 251,000 to South Punjab.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",
