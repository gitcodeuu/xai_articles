Pakistan’s Ambassador to the US Rizwan Saeed Sheikh and Commerce Secretary Jawad Paul, who were present during the meeting, accompanied Aurangzeb in the video statement.\n\n“Positive progress over the last few weeks and months was reviewed. Equally importantly, we focused on the slightly outstanding aspects,” the finance czar said, adding there was a clear commitment from both sides to “get closure” on those items.\n\nThe minister highlighted that as the US was Pakistan’s largest trading partner, it was quite critical to move forward in the “same spirit” in which the recent discussions had taken place.\n\n“In the next few days, we hope that the coming leadership-level announcements will reflect all the hard work and efforts that have been put in both by Pakistan and the US side,” Aurangzeb said.\n\nPakistan aims to finalise a long-term reciprocal tariff agreement that would prevent the re-imposition of a 29 per cent tariff on Pakistani exports — primarily textiles and agricultural products. While Trump has announced tariffs for some countries, talks with others are ongoing ahead of his extended August 1 deadline.\n\nEarlier this month, the countries reached an initial understanding on a deal that could shape the future of the country’s key export sectors. A formal announcement on any deal is expected only after the US concludes similar ongoing negotiations with other trade partners.\n\nA source close to the US administration has mentioned a further deadline: “The president wants concrete deliverables before the August 15 deadline. Countries that stall may find themselves on the wrong end of a tariff wall.”\n\nA senior Pakistani official involved in the negotiations said: “We’re not here for aid. We’re here for serious negotiations and a possible deal. It’s about mutual benefit now — trade, not dependence.”\n\nBehind the scenes, influential US-based businessmen with stakes in cryptocurrency and rare earth mineral ventures have quietly supported Pakistan’s efforts to gain greater access to American markets.\n\nIn April, the Pakistan Crypto Council (PCC) partnered with World Liberty Financial (WLF), a decentralised finance platform backed by US President Donald Trump. Earlier that month, a US delegation expressed Washington’s strategic interest in the country’s mineral sector.",
