  "content": "United States President Donald Trump sued media magnate Rupert Murdoch and The Wall Street Journal for at least $10 billion on Friday over the publication of a bombshell article on his friendship with the infamous alleged sex trafficker of underage girls, Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe defamation lawsuit, filed in federal court in Miami, saw the 79-year-old Republican hitting back at a scandal threatening to cause serious political damage.\n\n“We have just filed a powerhouse lawsuit against everyone involved in publishing the false, malicious, defamatory, fake news ‘article’ in the useless ‘rag’ that is The Wall Street Journal,” Trump posted on Truth Social late on Friday.\n\nThe Journal reported on Thursday that in 2003, the then-real estate magnate wrote a suggestive birthday letter to Epstein, illustrated with a naked woman and alluding to a shared “secret”.\n\nThe lawsuit, which also names two reporters, the Dow Jones corporation and Murdoch’s parent company News Corp as defendants, claims that no such letter exists and that the paper intended to malign Trump with a story that has now been viewed by hundreds of millions of people.\n\n“And given the timing of the defendants’ article, which shows their malicious intent behind it, the overwhelming financial and reputational harm suffered by President Trump will continue to multiply,” it said.\n\nDow Jones, the Journal‘s longtime publisher, responded to Trump’s libel suit on Friday, saying that it is standing by the story.\n\n“We have full confidence in the rigour and accuracy of our reporting, and will vigorously defend against any lawsuit,” a Dow Jones spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nIn another bid to dampen outrage among his own supporters about an alleged government cover-up of Epstein’s activities and 2019 death, Trump ordered US Attorney General Pam Bondi to seek the unsealing of grand jury testimony from the prosecution against the disgraced financier.\n\nIn a filing in New York, Bondi cited “extensive public interest” for the unusual request to release what is typically secret testimony.\n\nEpstein, a longtime friend of Trump and multiple high-profile men, was found hanging dead in a New York prison cell while awaiting trial on charges that he sexually exploited dozens of underage girls at his homes in New York and Florida.\n\nThe case sparked conspiracy theories, especially among Trump’s far-right voters, about an alleged international cabal of wealthy pedophiles. Epstein’s death — declared a suicide — before he could face trial supercharged the narrative.\n\nWhen Trump returned to power for a second term this January, his supporters clamoured for revelations about Epstein’s supposed list of clients. But Bondi issued an official memo this month declaring there was no such list.\n\nThe discontent in Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base poses a rare challenge to the Republican’s control of the political narrative in the United States.\n\nIt remained unclear whether a court would authorise the unsealing of the grand jury testimony.\n\nBut even if such material were made public, there is no assurance that it would shed much, if any, light on the main questions raised in the conspiracy theories — particularly the existence and possible contents of an Epstein client list.\n\nAsked on Friday by reporters if he would pursue the broader release of information related to the case, Trump did not answer.\n\nTrump was close with Epstein for years, and the two were photographed and videotaped together at parties, although there has never been evidence of wrongdoing.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal article published late on Thursday was damaging because it indicated a shared interest in sex.\n\nThe Journal reported that Trump had wished Epstein a happy 50th birthday in 2003 with a “bawdy” letter, part of an album of messages from rich and well-known figures.\n\nAccording to the Journal, the Trump letter contained the outline of a naked woman, apparently drawn with a marker, and had the future president’s signature “Donald” mimicking pubic hair. It ends, according to the newspaper, with “Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret”.\n\nTrump reacted in a series of furious social media posts, saying, “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”\n\n“I never wrote a picture in my life. I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said.\n\nUS media has published multiple drawings done by Trump in the past, with several dating to the early 2000s when he used his celebrity status to donate sketches for charity.",
