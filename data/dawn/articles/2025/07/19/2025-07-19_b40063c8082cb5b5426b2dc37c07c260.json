The policy, issued from the Centre Police Office, Islamabad, restrains the police officers and officials from speaking at public forums in official capacity, publishing articles in print media or giving any opinions or official statements across all social medial platforms.\n\nThe policy also prohibits making of videos and pictures in uniform in government premises, buildings, and vehicles or other private places for personal publicity and glorification.\n\nThere has been a bar on the police officials on uploading any kind of secret or official documents, pictures or content of the document on social media. Besides this, the officers and officials are also not allowed to share political or religious views on any platform.\n\nHowever, the officials require a prior permission from DIGs through Public Relations Branch, if they want to highlight some positive departmental activities through videos on social media platforms.\n\nHeads have been made responsible for personally supervising and monitoring the activities of officers and officials posted in their respective divisions, zones and units.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",
