However, Hangu DPO Khalid Khan, the Doaba station house officer (SHO), and an officer of the security forces were injured in the exchange of fire,” it added.\n\nThe statement said that DPO Khan “was hit by three bullets”.\n\nIG Hameed spoke to the injured officers and enquired about their well-being, according to the police statement.\n\n“Law enforcement agencies are determined to continue their fight against terrorism,” the statement added.\n\nPakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081. KP has seen an increasing trend of terrorism-related incidents.\n\nOn June 21, KP police killed a terrorist and injured two others belonging to the TTP group in Dera Ismail Khan as they attempted to attack the police.\n\nIn May, two policemen were martyred and two were injured in a suicide attack in Peshawar, while in a separate incident, two cops lost their lives as a result of an attack on a police checkpoint in Bannu.\n\nFaced with increasing attacks by militants, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.\n\nEarlier this week, three “wanted terrorists” were killed during a joint operation between the regional police and the Counter Terrorism Department (CTD) in Bannu district.\n\nOn July 5, three suspected terrorists belonging to the TTP’s Tipu Gul group were killed in a joint operation by the CTD.\n\nAdditional reporting by Umar Bacha",
