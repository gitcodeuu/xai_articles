  "content": "LAHORE: The financial woes of the cash-strapped Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) are likely to deepen as the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) has refused to release travel and daily allowances (TA/DA) for national hockey teams and has also demanded a detailed account of the funds disbursed to the federation over the past year.\n\nIn a letter addressed to PHF president Tariq Hussain Bugti on Friday — a copy of which was obtained by Dawn — the PSB raised several objections and sought an explanation from the federation over its failure to provide the required documentation related to previously allocated funds.\n\n“I am directed to refer to PHF’s email dated July 15, 2025, regarding TA/DA for national hockey players who participated in the Nations Cup held in Malaysia, and to state that PHF has been repeatedly approaching PSB for financial assistance, including TA/DA payments, despite failing to provide complete documentation for the substantial funds already disbursed during the past year,” the letter stated.\n\nThe PSB pointed out that this “persistent non-compliance” had been bro­ught to the attention of both the president and secretary general of the PHF on multiple occasions, both in writing and verbally, but the required financial records remained outstanding.\n\nThe letter further clarified that the payment of TA/DA to players and officials, particularly at self-approved rates set by the PHF, fell entirely under the federation’s responsibility. “PSB bears no liability in this regard,” it noted.\n\nReferring to a previous PHF communication dated May 30, 2025, in which the federation claimed to have sufficient funds in its bank account, the PSB questioned why payments were not made to players during the recent FIH Nations Cup.\n\n“Despite PSB’s letter dated June 20, 2025, seeking clarification and urging immediate disbursement, no response has been received to date,” the letter said.\n\nThe PSB has now asked the PHF to submit certified bank statements of all operational and grant-utilisation accounts for the past six months, a full record of foreign tours undertaken by the PHF president and secretary during the same period — including their purpose, destinations, dates, costs, and sources of funding — as well as a detailed breakdown of the expenses incurred in establishing the federation’s new sub-office in Islamabad, along with evidence of approval from its Executive Board.\n\nIt is pertinent to mention that Tariq has established a sub-office in Islamabad, while secretary Rana Mujahid rarely visits the federation’s headquarters in Lahore, as both officials now primarily operate from the federal capital.\n\nNo deadline was stipulated in the PSB letter for the submission of the requested information.\n\nSources familiar with the matter told Dawn that the PHF risks losing all forms of support, including financial and logistical assistance, if it fails to comply with the PSB’s directives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",
