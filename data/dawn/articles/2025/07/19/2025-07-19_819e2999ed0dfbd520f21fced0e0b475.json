  "content": "MADRID: The rare anti-migrant violence that recently rocked a Spanish town demonstrated how online disinformation feeds xenophobic hate speech, which leapt from screens to real life with the support of politicians, experts said.\n\nLast weekend’s unrest in the southeastern town of Torre Pacheco pitted far-right groups against immigrant residents, mainly of Moroccan origin, but a heavy police presence prevented serious confrontation.\n\nThe altercations were sparked after a 68-year-old pensioner said three men of North African origin attacked him without provocation on July 9.\n\nTwo days later, the conservative-led city council organised a protest against insecurity, which quickly escalated when far-right groups joined with hostile slogans against immigrants.\n\nThat day, and for several nights, riots broke out in the streets of the southeastern city of 40,000.\n\nAuthorities have arrested 14 people, including three suspected of involvement in the attack on the retiree.\n\nAlso among those detained is the leader of the far-right “Deport Them Now” group, who allegedly called for a “hunt” of migrants on social media.\n\nThe sudden outbreak of violence took Spain by surprise, but anti-migrant discourse had already been brewing, partly due to disinformation circulating on social media.\n\nFalse claims debunked\n\nThis agency’s digital verification team in Spain has debunked many false claims linked to immigrants, mostly concerning public benefits they supposedly receive and alleged attacks by foreigners on Spanish customs.\n\nFor Alexandre Lopez Borrull, a professor in communication and information science at the Open University of Catalonia, disinformation in such cases is “the fuel and the spark at the same time”.\n\nThe narrative “is fuelled over a long period of time” and when a specific event occurs, it can act as a spark in scenarios like the one that played out in Torre Pacheco, he said.\n\nA video purporting to show the assault on the pensioner, along with a list of alleged attackers, quickly circulated online — both debunked by the verification team.\n\nElisa Brey, a sociology professor at Madrid’s Complutense University, likened the phenomenon to criminals setting off wildfires.\n\n“It’s hot, there’s a temperature alert, and an arsonist passes by and throws a match. That is what happens with disinformation,” she said.\n\nAim to destabilise\n\nExperts also emphasised the role of politicians, particularly the far-right Vox party, in fanning the flames of anti-migrant rhetoric.\n\nVox has long connected immigration to crime and recently proposed, echoing other EU political parties and far-right activists, that some migrants be deported as part of a broad “remigration” plan.\n\nForeigners make up 14 per cent of Spain’s population, up from only 1.6 per cent in 1998.\n\nIn events like the violent protests in Torre Pacheco, malicious discourse seeps through different layers of social media before erupting into the public sphere, Brey explained.\n\nFirst, it simmers at an “underlying” level on less visible platforms like Telegram, before jumping to more popular networks such as X and TikTok.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",
