  "content": "LAHORE: The Muzaffargarh police on Friday succeeded in forcing Bosan gang members to surrender and recovered 100 lifted buffaloes after a 12-day stand-off.\n\nThe police had cordoned off the riverine area of Latti in Alipur tehsil as Muzaffargarh, Rajanpur and Rahim Yar Khan police did not allow anyone to cross the river. The police continuously patrolled the area after setting up check posts and fire was also exchanged during the stand-off.\n\nThe notorious Bosan and other gangs from Mouza Latti had taken away 260 cattle worth Rs324 million at gunpoint 12 days ago. The Kundai police had registered a case against 20 nominated and 10 unidentified suspects under section 395 (dacoity) of the PPC on the complaint of Muhammad Hussain.\n\nThe victim reported that 30 armed men, led by Fayyaz Bosan, raided his cattle farm in the Langarwah area on July 7.\n\nAccording to the complainant, the gang held his brother Habib and farm workers hostage, tied them up, and escaped with 144 buffaloes, 30 calves and 26 cows. The robbers also allegedly stole mobile phones and cash before fleeing toward the riverine area. The hostages were later freed by locals.\n\nDistrict Police Officer (DPO) Dr Rizwan Ahmad Khan said that five members of the Bosan gang surrendered and also handed over 100 cattle. He said some of the gang members fled the scene and they were conducting raids to arrest them.\n\nHe said that the suspects claimed that they took 130 cattle but only managed to cross the river with 100 and left the remaining cattle in the river.\n\nThe DPO said that local politicians, especially MNA Aamir Talal Gopang, played a role in forcing the gang members to surrender.\n\nHe said the cattle were handed over to the owners and they would also take legal action against the gang members.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 19th, 2025",
