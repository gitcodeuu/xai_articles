The clergy are bound by 227 strict rules, including a ban on masturbation, touching women and even handling objects directly from them.\n\nMonks traditionally survive on alms, food offerings and a modest $170 monthly stipend, but some pocket fees for lectures, blessings and ceremonies — blurring the line between faith and fortune.\n\nIn a TV interview, the woman at the heart of the scandal said she had developed a “splurging attitude” as her monk lovers lavished her with shopping trips worth up to $90,000 a day.\n\nMotorcycle taxi driver Mongkol said he now prefers to donate to hospitals or schools for underprivileged children. “It feels more meaningful than giving money to temples,” he told AFP.\n\nThis month’s scandal is not the first to rock the monkhood.\n\nIn 2017, police raided Wat Dhammakaya temple north of Bangkok, arresting its former abbot over allegations of laundering $33m in public donations.\n\nThis May, police held another monk in the capital over allegations of embezzling nearly $10m from a temple for an online gambling network.\n\nBuddhism scholar Danai Preechapermprasit said repeated scandals — especially among senior monks — have “shaken people to the core”.\n\n“People question whether donations are used for spiritual significance or personal desire,” he told AFP. “I think Thailand has reached a point where it’s difficult for monks to even walk down the street.”\n\nA powerful lawmaker has pledged tighter regulations within three months, including mandatory donation disclosures and laws treating monk misconduct as a criminal offence.\n\n“This case does not represent Buddhism as a whole,” said national police chief Kitrat Panphet on Thursday, pledging a new task force to probe misbehaving monks. “It’s about a few individuals doing wrong,” he said.\n\nIn Buddhist tradition, monks are viewed as the Buddha’s spiritual heirs, entrusted with preserving and passing on his teachings.\n\nBut at Wat Bowonniwet in Bangkok, one of Thailand’s most revered temples, only 26 monks were ordained this year, a steep drop from nearly 100 before the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nA monk there, speaking to AFP anonymously, blamed societal changes after the pandemic, which forced people into isolation, saying nowadays “people prefer to live outside the temple life”.\n\nBut independent Buddhism expert Jaturong Jongarsa said temples are increasingly being treated as “a garbage dump”, where families send drug addicts or LGBTQ youth to be “corrected”.\n\n“Temples are no longer seen as the sacred spaces they once were,” he told AFP. “People send their problems to the temple and hope they’ll go away.”\n\nStill, not all Thais have lost faith.\n\nCamphun Parimiphut, a 52-year-old security guard from Maha Sarakham in Thailand’s northeast, said: “Buddhism is about the teachings, not the individuals who fail it”.\n\nBecause of corruption scandals, he now avoids giving money to monks, preferring to donate only food. But his devotion remains steadfast.\n\n“You can lose faith in monks,” he said. “But never lose trust in Buddhist teachings. They still teach us how to live a good life. “",
