We will ensure no family is left without shelter,” he said, adding that interim housing arrangements would be made until permanent plots are allocated.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Governor Tessori vowed to personally look into the matter.\n\n“I will be sending all my recommendations regarding this tragedy to the Sindh government through a formal letter. This is no minor matter. There will be no silence, and those responsible will be held to account,” he stated.\n\nHe also urged the provincial government to provide six months’ rent and temporary relocation within the same locality for residents evacuated from the dangerously unsafe buildings.\n\nHe further assured that the Governor House would remain actively engaged in relief efforts, offering essential support including ration supplies and employment opportunities for the affected families.\n\nAs the government continues to identify more dangerous structures, questions remain about the authorities’ capacity to both enforce regulations and ensure humane treatment of residents displaced by such enforcement.\n\nFive-member committee notified\n\nThe Sindh government on Tuesday formed a five-member inquiry committee headed by Karachi Commissioner Syed Hassan Naqvi, comprising Special Secretary Ayesha Hameed, SBCA’s Nadeem Ahmed and Asif Ali Langah and the local government department’s Hammadullah Seehar.\n\n“The committee has been directed to conduct a thorough inquiry into the incident, which occurred on 4 July 2025, and submit its findings within 48 hours. The Terms of Reference (ToRs) also mandate the committee to identify those responsible for negligence and propose recommendations to prevent similar incidents in the future,” said a statement detailing the notification.\n\n“Furthermore, the committee is tasked with developing a mechanism for the evacuation of residents from buildings deemed dangerous. It has been authorised to co-opt any relevant officer required during the course of the inquiry.”\n\nThe committee held its maiden meeting on Tuesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
