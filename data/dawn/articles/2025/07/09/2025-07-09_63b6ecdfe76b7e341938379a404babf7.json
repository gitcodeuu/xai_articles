This workforce will be responsible for door-to-door collection of solid waste and its transportation to the designated collection points managed by tehsil municipal administrations. Every union council will initially be provided with one loader vehicle and other necessary equipment for waste collection and sanitation.\n\nThe programme’s implementation will be supervised by the respective assistant commissioner, tehsil municipal officer and assistant director (local government).\n\nThe participation of elected local government representatives and relevant committees will also be ensured to enhance the programme’s success. Also, an effective monitoring mechanism will be established to oversee its execution.\n\nThe meeting was informed that the programme will be formally launched immediately after approval in the upcoming provincial cabinet meeting. In the second phase, the programme will be extended to union councils in the hilly regions of the province.\n\nAbout the significance of the initiative, the chief minister said that it was a signature programme of the provincial government.\n\n“For the first time in the history of the province, sanitation services are being introduced in rural areas. I hope that the programme will be formally launched by August 14 this year,” he said.\n\nMr Gandapur said that the initiative would not only ensure cleanliness in rural areas but also provide employment opportunities to thousands of people.\n\nHe directed authorities to take all necessary steps for timely implementation of the programme in accordance with the defined timelines.\n\nThe chief minister said that transparency and strict adherence to rules and regulations must be ensured in the recruitment of sanitation workers.\n\nHe said that a realistic and sustainable strategy should be devised to ensure the long-term continuity of the programme.\n\nMeanwhile, the provincial government has officially launched a digital identity system, Khyber Pass.\n\nA formal ceremony marking the inauguration of the system was held at the Chief Minister’s House on Tuesday, where Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur formally launched the Khyber Pass digital platform.\n\nThe ceremony was attended by Special Assistant to the Chief Minister on Information Technology Shafqat Ayaz, members of the provincial cabinet and provincial assembly, and senior government officials.\n\nAccording to the official statement, Khyber Pass is the first-of-its-kind digital identity system in Pakistan on the basis of a QR code mechanism. It will be integrated with Nadra and other government databases, enabling citizens to access all their identity-related information online. With this system, citizens will no longer need to repeatedly provide personal information to avail government services.\n\nThrough a single Khyber Pass digital account, residents will be able to access all public services offered by the provincial government.\n\nThe unified QR code will serve as a gateway to services such as health, education, taxation, licensing, property records and more, eliminating the need for multiple registrations or form submissions. Citizens will no longer have to visit different offices or wait in long queues, as services will be accessible online through a single digital ID.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
