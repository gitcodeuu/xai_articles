  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan’s fisheries and aquaculture sector can significantly attract private sector investments and boost its export-based contribution to the national economy with focused attention on accelerated growth and sustainable management practices through a coherent policy and governance mechanism, says the policy drafted by the Food and Agriculture Organi­sation (FAO) of the United Nations.\n\nThe policy, titled National Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy 2025-2035, aims at responsible use of marine and inland fisheries and aquaculture resources through coherent governance at federal and provincial levels for sustainable management and resilient development, ensuring food security.\n\nThe policy also aims to ensure livelihoods of the people, poverty alleviation and comprehensive export-oriented growth of the fisheries sector.\n\nWith a 1,001-km coastline and 240,000 square km Exclusive Econo­mic Zone (EEZ), the country’s marine fisheries resources have shared rights for exploitation thro­ugh clear jurisdiction of federal government and the governments of Sindh and Balochistan. These resources are crucial for the country’s economy, livelihoods and food security.\n\nThese resources have significant potential of developing into a multi-billion-dollar sustainable industry, with opportunities to earn over $2 billion in exports and generate employment for over a million families.\n\nHowever, overfishing, overcapacity, and destructive practices have depleted fish stocks by 60 to 90 per cent. Responsible use of these resources is essential to prevent further depletion and ensure their long-term viability.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
