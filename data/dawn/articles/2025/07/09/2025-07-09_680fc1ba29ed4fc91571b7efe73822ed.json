  "content": "KARACHI: Honda Atlas Cars Ltd (HACL) has increased the prices of various models by Rs47,000-201,000 owing to the NEV levy imposed by the government in the federal budget for FY26. The new prices are effective from July 1.\n\nAs per price notice issued to the dealers, Honda City 1.2MT, 1.2 CVT and Aspire CVT now carry price of Rs4.696 million, Rs4.737m and Rs5.969m, up by Rs47,000, Rs48,000 and Rs120,000, respectively.\n\nAfter a jump of Rs130,000, Rs175,000 and Rs201,000, Honda BR-V 1.5 CVT 5, Civic Oriel and Civic Turbo RS models are now available at Rs6.429m, Rs8.834m and Rs10.10m.\n\nHACL said despite continued challenges such as rupee devaluation and increased freight cost, the company has been absorbing all such impacts without increasing prices. However, the NEV levy is beyond company’s control and has to pass to the consumers.\n\nThe prices are exclusive of freight and withholding tax which is to be charged from customers based on applicable rates.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
