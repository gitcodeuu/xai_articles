He was booked after demonstrators took to the streets of Muzaf­farabad on Tuesday, demanding punishment for the individual who they accused of allegedly making disrespectful remarks.\n\nThe FIR noted that after the suspect was taken into custody, the case was referred to a committee to evaluate whether the remarks met the legal threshold for blasphemy charges.\n\nThe controversy stem­med from a viral video clip recorded last week.\n\nSSP Syed Riaz Haider Bukhari urged citizens to preserve communal harm­ony and avoid provocative actions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
