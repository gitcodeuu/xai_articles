  "content": "Apple is in talks to acquire the US broadcast rights to screen Formula 1 when the contract becomes available next year, the Financial Times reported on Wednesday, following the success of Brad Pitt-starrer F1: The Movie.\n\nThe report follows the strong box office performance of Apple’s high-octane racing film F1: The Movie, which has grossed $293 million in its first 10 days, according to Variety and other outlets.\n\nThe iPhone maker is challenging current US broadcaster ESPN, owned by Disney, for the Formula 1 rights next year, the FT report said, citing sources familiar with the matter.\n\nReuters could not immediately confirm the report.\n\nNetflix’s Formula 1: Drive to Survive series helped boost the sport’s popularity in the United States, a momentum Apple now hopes to capitalise on.\n\nSeveral media outlets reported in February that Netflix is among the contenders for Formula 1’s US broadcasting rights from the 2026 season as ESPN’s exclusivity period to negotiate a new contract with F1 expired.\n\nApple and F1 did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.",
