  "content": "KARACHI: The Pakis­tan Stock Exchange (PSX) continued its record-breaking streak for the eighth consecutive session on Tuesday, as the benchmark KSE-100 index briefly surged past the 134,000 mark during intraday trade before ending the day marginally higher at yet another all-time closing high.\n\nAccording to Topline Securities Ltd, the market remained highly volatile throughout the session, swinging between an intraday high of 830 points and a low of 673 points. The KSE-100 index eventually settled at 133,403.19 — up by 33.04 points or 0.02pc — reflecting a pause in momentum after several days of strong gains.\n\nProfit-taking dominated the session as investors opted to lock in recent gains, leading to a mixed performance across sectors. On the gainers’ board, Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd, Askari Bank Ltd, Meezan Bank, Indus Motor, and MCB Bank collectively added 222 points to the index. Conversely, selling pressure in Fauji Fertiliser Company, Systems Ltd, Engro Fertiliser, and Mari Petroleum pulled the index down by 173 points.\n\nInvestor participation remained robust, with total traded volume hitting 1.20bn shares and a turnover of Rs41.99bn. TPL Properties led the volumes chart with 96.7m shares traded. Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation attributed the day’s gains to receding fears of US trade tariffs and a 7.22pc year-on-year rise in textile exports in FY25.\n\nHe added that a sharp drop in Pakistan’s credit default swap indicated reduced default risk, while stability in the rupee and anticipation of major corporate earnings next week helped sustain positive sentiment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
