No budgets are being recalibrated for coping better with the crisis,” she noted.\n\n“If there is one priority for collective climate action in Pakistan it has to be water conservation. The water crisis means we have either too much water in the system and rivers at the wrong time, or too little when and where we need it, to sustain food security and livelihoods across the country.\n\nPakistan, she noted, is deeply underprepared for the scale of climate investment required: “To meet the climate crisis head on, everything will have to be scaled up. Finance is just one part of it. And let’s be clear — it’s not coming in anywhere close to the quantum needed by frontline ecosystems like ours.”\n\nShe also reminded the in­­t­ernational community of their responsibilities and str­­essed the importance of public-private partnerships.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
