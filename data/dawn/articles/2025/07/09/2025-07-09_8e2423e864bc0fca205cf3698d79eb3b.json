Turkiye’s Minister of National Defence Yasar Guler is also visiting Pakistan.\n\nPakistan and Turkiye enjoy strong bilateral ties built on shared cultural, religious and historical bonds, as well as mutual respect. In February, the two countries pledged to boost bilateral trade to $5 billion as President Recep Tayyip Erdogan visited Islamabad.\n\n“We are pursuing the establishment of a Special Economic Zone dedicated to Turkish entrepreneurs at Karachi,” Dar said, addressing a press conference alongside Fidan at the Foreign Office (FO).\n\nDar also mentioned other engagements, including the revival of the Istanbul-Tehran-Islamabad train, saying, “Our delegations are meeting in the coming weeks to finalise the roadmap for revival.”\n\nThe deputy PM further said that Pakistan has allocated land for the construction of a Maarif School in Muzaffarabad, referring to the Turkish Maarif Foundation, which Fidan said has more than 80 schools in Pakistan.\n\n“A Maarif Foundation delegation is visiting Muzaffarabad today and visiting the site for evaluation,” he said.\n\nDar further stated that Turkish companies were being considered for undertaking the Jinnah Medical Complex and Daanish University megaprojects in Islamabad.\n\nThe Turkish companies will also be participating in offshore drilling projects and the privatisation of electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the power sector, he highlighted.\n\n“We are actively engaged in different activities, including capacity building and counterterrorism,” Dar asserted.\n\nHe appreciated Turkiye’s indigenisation of the defence industry from 20 per cent to 80pc in the last few years, adding: “We would like to benefit from Turkiye’s experience and expertise.”\n\nIn his remarks, the Turkish foreign minister said defence cooperation will be further strengthened in the coming days, state-run Radio Pakistan reported.\n\nFidan called it a “strategic step”, emphasising that it was very important for the security of Pakistan and Turkiye. He asserted that both countries will continue to support each other in countering terrorism. Over a month ago, the two nations conducted a joint operation and arrested a high-ranking terrorist.\n\nReferring to the recent Pakistan-India conflict, Fidan was “appreciative of Pakistan’s wisdom-oriented attitude”, Radio Pakistan stated.\n\nHe noted that Turkiye and Pakistan were intensifying their cooperation in the field of energy, including mining, precious stones, natural gas and oil. The minister also highlighted that the two nations have expanded their relations in other fields, such as the economy, education and culture.\n\nFidan reiterated the countries’ aim to increase their commercial relations to $5bn and expressed the firm resolve to take Pakistan-Turkiye relations to a higher level, Radio Pakistan added.\n\nFollowing their meetings, Dar wrote on X: “Held productive discussions on the entire gamut of bilateral relations and exchanged views on key regional and global developments.\n\n’“Pakistan and Türkiye share deep-rooted bonds of brotherhood, mutual trust, and strategic cooperation,” the deputy PM stressed.\n\nSeparately, a high-level delegation led by Guler called on Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Baber Sidhu, the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) chief, at the Air Headquarters in Islamabad.\n\nBoth officials agreed on the establishment of “dedicated joint working groups to streamline and accelerate progress across various sectors of mutual interest”, according to a statement by Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR).\n\nThe meeting encompassed discussions on evolving regional security dynamics, progress of ongoing defence cooperation and prospects for future collaboration in emerging domains of warfare, ISPR said.\n\nThe Turkish defence minister expressed sincere gratitude to the air chief for the warm reception and gracious hospitality extended by the PAF.\n\nHe lauded PAF’s “exceptional performance under the insightful leadership of the air chief in the recent conflict with India, commending its operational preparedness and resolute defence of national sovereignty”, the ISPR said.\n\n“Highlighting the longstanding fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan, Yasar Guler conveyed Turkiye’s earnest desire to bolster bilateral defence relations through deeper industry-to-industry collaboration,” the ISPR highlighted.\n\nGuler “particularly emphasised the need to explore joint ventures in cutting-edge domains, including niche disruptive technologies, advanced avionics and unmanned aerial systems”, the statement said.\n\nThe Turkish defence minister expressed his appreciation for PAF’s continued support in the pilot exchange programme, which he termed as a “vital initiative for fostering professional growth and operational understanding” between the two air forces.\n\nDuring the meeting, the Air Chief Marshal Sidhu highlighted the enduring brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, emphasising the common aspirations and strategic convergence that bind the two nations.\n\nHe reaffirmed PAF’s “steadfast resolve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation in the domains of advanced training and aerospace technologies”, the military’s media wing said.\n\n“Both dignitaries concurred on finalising the modalities for enhanced training collaboration and reaffirmed their strong commitment to expanding the scale and scope of joint bilateral and multilateral air exercises,” according to the ISPR.\n\nThe military’s media wing noted that the visit reflected the shared commitment of both nations to enhance strategic cooperation, solidify defence ties and promote “lasting institutional linkages” between the armed forces of Pakistan and Turkiye.\n\nMeanwhile, Dar and Fidan co-chaired the first meeting of a joint commission established in February during President Erdogan’s visit, the FO said in a statement.\n\nDar expressed satisfaction with the progress of all 12 Joint Standing Committees (JSCs) working under the High-Level Strategic Cooperation Council (HLSCC) framework, saying they have “either already met or are scheduled to meet in the coming weeks”.\n\nEstablished in 2009, HLSCC is the highest decision-making forum bet­ween the two countries, guiding bilateral relations through joint standing committees covering trade, investment, defen­­ce, energy, agriculture, IT, health and education.\n\nDuring the press briefing, Dar said that the JSC on security, defence and intelligence was scheduled to meet on July 24 in Islamabad, while the committee on transport and communication was expected to meet next week.\n\nThe trade and investment JSC met on June 20, Dar noted, adding that the committee on defence industries was scheduled to meet later in September.\n\n“Similarly, other committees — health, science and technology; social sector development; culture and tourism; agriculture and water; energy and power; banking and finance; and the political and diplomatic coordination committee are expected to meet in the coming months,” he said.\n\nThe upcoming meeting of the Joint Ministerial Commission (JMC), co-chaired by Güler and Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, is also expected to be held next week, FO said.\n\n“This important platform is expected to further bolster economic cooperation between the two countries,” it highlighted.\n\nThe FO added that both sides exchanged views on a range of regional and global developments, and reaffirmed their commitment to regional peace.\n\nA day ago, the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs had announced that Fidan, along with Guler, will visit Pakistan on July 9. Fidan also paid a visit to Islamabad in May last year.\n\nFidan arrived in the early hours of Wednesday to hold discussions on bilateral issues, the Foreign Office said on X.\n\n“During his official engagements in Pakistan, all important issues of mutual interest will be discussed,” the FO said. “The visit reflects the close and brotherly ties between Pakistan and Turkiye, rooted in shared history, culture, and mutual trust.”\n\nIt added that upon their arrival, the visiting dignitaries were received by Pakistan’s Additional Secretary for West Asia, Ambassador Syed Ali Asad Gillani.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pakistan had extended condolences to Turkiye after 12 Turkish soldiers died of methane exposure in Iraq during a search mission in the Claw-Lock Operation zone a day earlier.\n\nLast week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif met on the sidelines of the Economic Cooperation Organisation (ECO) summit in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, to reaffirm their commitment to strengthening bilateral ties.\n\nThe two leaders discussed deepening cooperation in key areas, including trade, energy, defence, connectivity and investment. PM Shehbaz reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to working closely with Turkiye to promote peace, stability and sustainable development in the region.",
