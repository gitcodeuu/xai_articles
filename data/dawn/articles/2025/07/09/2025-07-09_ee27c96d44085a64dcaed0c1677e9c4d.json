He said custody of the suspect was required to verify his age and further investigation.\n\nThe counsel, appearing on behalf of the suspect, opposed the remand request but the magistrate allowed the prosecution’s plea.\n\nThe magistrate approved physical remand of the suspect for four days and directed the police to produce him again after completion of the remand period along with the investigation report.\n\nAccording to police, the underage driver was driving a black SUV (Sports Utility Vehicle) at over 120kph on a road leading to a village in Shahdara when he hit at least three motorcycles.\n\nIn the incident, Malik Amin died on the spot while his brother, Malik Farid, was among the injured persons who were shifted to hospital.\n\nInitial investigation reveals the SUV belonged to the owner of the house where the boy lived along with his maternal grandmother.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 9th, 2025",
