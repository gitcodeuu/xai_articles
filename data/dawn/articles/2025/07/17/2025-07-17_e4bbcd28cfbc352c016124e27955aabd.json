  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Wednesday distributed copies of challan to leaders and workers of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) in two protest-related cases and set July 26 for formal indictment proceedings.\n\nATC Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra formally handed over the copies to party members present in court for cases stemming from the ‘Azaadi March’ and a Nov 26 demonstration in 2022.\n\nThe court issued arrest warrants for absent defendants.\n\nMeanwhile, the hearing in the Azaadi March case, registered at Sangjani police station, could not proceed because PTI’s founding chairman Imran Khan was absent.\n\nATC distributes copies of challan to leaders, workers in cases related to Azaadi March and Nov 26 protest\n\nThe court noted it had not received a response from the law ministry regarding a letter previously sent about the matter.\n\nJudge Sipra directed the prosecutors to follow up with the ministry and report back at the next hearing, also scheduled for July 26.\n\nIn a separate case, a hearing on charges that the former prime minister threatened a female judge was postponed until July 30 as the court awaits a response from the Islamabad High Court on whether to conduct the trial inside jail premises.\n\nJudicial Magistrate Mureed Abbas, who presided over Wednesday’s hearing, took no action pending the high court decision.\n\nThe request for a jail trial was made citing security concerns.\n\nThe case, filed at Margalla police station, accuses Imran Khan of making threatening remarks against a female judge during a political rally.\n\nThe incident drew widespread criticism and led to charges under relevant penal and anti-terrorism laws.\n\nMr Khan, who was ousted as prime minister through a no-confidence vote in 2022, faces multiple legal cases that his party claims are politically motivated.\n\nThe cases primarily stem from a volatile PTI-led demonstration on 25 May to 26 May 2022 known as ‘Azaadi March’, occurred shortly after Khan’s government was ousted, and later Nov 26, which was organised to demand the release of the party’s jailed founder, Imran Khan.\n\nThe accused face charges under anti-terrorism laws, with offences ranging from rioting to causing public disorder.\n\nIt may be recalled that the PTI had organised the march on Islamabad, mainly from Peshawar, to press for the release of its jailed leader Imran Khan.\n\nThe protests, which saw thousands converge on Islamabad led by Mr Khan’s wife Bushra Bibi and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur, descended into violent clashes with security forces.\n\nAn FIR said that protesters, armed with firearms, stones, and batons, attacked police and Rangers personnel.\n\nThe clashes resulted in at least six deaths, including that of a Rangers official, over three days.\n\nThe death led to the murder charges being filed against PTI’s top leadership, including Imran Khan.\n\nSecurity forces responded with tear gas and rubber bullets as protesters allegedly set vehicles ablaze and damaged property.\n\nThe events culminated in a large-scale crackdown, with officials reporting nearly 1,000 arrests.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 17th, 2025",
