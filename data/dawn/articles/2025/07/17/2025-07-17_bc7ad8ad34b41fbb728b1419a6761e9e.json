  "content": "Section 144 was imposed across Punjab along with a state of emergency in several districts on Thursday as heavy rains triggered flooding and claimed over 60 lives across the province in the past 24 hours, according to authorities.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) on Monday issued a warning of torrential rains with wind-thundershowers that would last throughout the country till today. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) has forecasted that heavy rains will continue to lash parts of the country over the next 24 hours.\n\nData from the Punjab Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) showed that 61 people were killed and 268 injured in the last 24 hours, warning that more monsoon rains were expected in the coming days.\n\nAn order from the Punjab Home Department said there was a significant increase in the accumulation of rainwater in low-lying areas, streets and open spaces, posing serious risks to the safety of children who often bathed in standing water.\n\n“Dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries across the province of Punjab experience heightened water levels and stronger currents during these periods, making swimming and unauthorised boating activities extremely hazardous for human life, leading to a high potential for drowning and other tragic incidents.\n\n“Prevailing weather conditions and the inherent dangers associated with these activities, necessitates immediate preventive measures to safeguard public safety and prevent loss of precious human lives,” the order said.\n\nIt added that the home secretary was thus imposing a complete ban under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure across the province on bathing in accumulated rainwater on streets, roads, open spaces, or any other area where rainwater has collected; swimming in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries, and boating by any unauthorised person or for unauthorised purposes in dams, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes and distributaries.\n\n“This order shall remain in force for a period of 45 days from the date of issuance unless withdrawn.”\n\nPunjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz also announced that “a rain emergency has been imposed in different areas of Punjab due to unprecedented torrential rains and a flood situation.”\n\nShe added that directives were issued to keep the public alert through sirens and announcements. The chief minister urged the public to cooperate with the local authorities and take safety precautions.\n\nIn Jhelum, rescue operations were underway to evacuate citizens trapped in floodwaters in Dhok Biddar, Dhok Shah Arif, Sohawa, Rasoolpur, Chak Muhammad and Bhampar villages, according to Punjab Rescue 1122 spokesperson Farooq Ahmad.\n\nAround 57 people have been rescued so far with the help of the Pakistan Army, he said in a statement, with more than 50 rescue boats involved in the Jhelum operations.\n\nThe spokesperson added that rescue teams have been deployed across the province, including Mianwali, Rawalpindi, Chakwal, Attock, Dera Ghazi Khan, Rahim Yar Khan, Rajanpur and Layyah. Over 15,000 rescue personnel and 800 rescue boats were on high alert, Ahmad added.\n\n“Pakistan Army personnel and rescue teams are currently rushing the citizens to safe locations,” he said.\n\n“Children were screaming for help, and women stood on rooftops, waving their shawls and begging to be rescued,” Tariq Mehbood Bhatti, a 51-year-old farmer in Gujrat’s Ladian village, was quoted as saying by AFP.\n\nJhelum Deputy Commissioner Muhammad Meisam Abbas told Dawn.com that high floods were noted in Bhimber, Dara Pur, Chakri, Chak Majo, Dhoke Bidar, Rajroor, Nakki, Mamyan, Nakka Khlaspur, Sahoowal, Samanwaal, Bara Phaphrah and other towns and villages were among the affected areas.\n\nDPO Tariq Aziz Sindhu said six policemen got stuck amid the flood, five of whom were rescued while a constable was carried away by the water.\n\n“A search operation for him was underway in the area,” the officer added.\n\nBilal Azhar Kiani, minister of state for finance, said while talking to Dawn.com from the monitoring centre about floods in his home district of Jhelum that a quick response was given to the eventual situation that was being directly monitored by the chief minister.\n\n“The integrated response by Rescue 1122, the army, the police and the civil defence prevented casualties,” he said.\n\nThe minister said that relief centres for displaced families were established at safe places with medical teams for the treatment of the residents and livestock.\n\nKiani said that a search operation for the retrieval of missing cattle and livestock of those affected was also underway, and all-out efforts were underway to minimise.\n\n“The chief minister will announce a package for the rehabilitation of the affectees,” the minister said.\n\nPunjab Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) Director General Tayyab Farid said that “rivers have overflowed due to heavy rains in Rawalpindi, Chakwal and surrounding areas”, leading to a flood situation.\n\n“Citizens have been advised to avoid unnecessary travel, stay away from power lines and open manholes,” the Wasa DG said in a statement.\n\nThe PMD’s Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) warned that urban flooding was expected in Rawalpindi, Gujranwala and Faisalabad divisions during the next 24 hours.\n\nHowever, it added that the wet spell was likely to subside in the next 48 hours.\n\nIn a post on X, the PMD said the heavy monsoon rains triggered a “significant surge” in water levels at the Tarbela, Mangla, Khanpur, Simly and Rawal reservoirs.\n\nThe water level at Khanpur witnessed a gain of 4.5 feet, while the other four recorded an increase of a foot each.\n\nIn a weather outlook, the FFD said the water flows in the eastern rivers were likely to increase from July 21.\n\nPakistan experiences monsoon rainfall from June to September every year. The heavy rains also trigger deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.\n\nAccording to the National Disaster Management Authority’s website, monsoon rains since June 26 have killed 178 people across the country and injured 491 people.\n\nThe majority of casualties were recorded in Punjab, the country’s most populous province, with 103 deaths and 385 injuries. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 38 fatalities, Sindh 20, Balochistan 16 and one death in Azad Kashmir.\n\nOver 57 per cent of nationwide deaths were caused by “house-collapse” incidents. Monsoon rains so far have damaged 610 houses and led to the deaths of 126 livestock.\n\nEarlier today, the PMD issued a flood alert for the Gawalmandi and Kattarian stations in Rawalpindi as the water level in the Leh Nullah rose.\n\nAt 10:50am, the Gawalmandi and Kattarian gauges had crossed the 20ft level, at which evacuation is supposed to be ordered. However, the water levels soon started to recede, reaching 7ft at Gawalmandi and 8ft at Kattarian at 4:21pm, according to the PMD’s real-time monitor.\n\nFollowing the flood alert in the morning, the PDMA imposed a rain emergency in Rawalpindi, with Director General Irfan Ali Kathia noting that a local holiday has been announced in the district.\n\nDG Kathia urged residents of low-lying areas near Leh Nullah to “cooperate with the administration if evacuation becomes necessary”. In a statement, he warned that strict action will be taken against those gathering or bathing near Leh Nullah.\n\nIn a separate statement, the PDMA also detailed the equipment provided to the Rawalpindi administration for its relief efforts. This included 16 outboard motor boats, 205 life jackets, 31 ambulances, 19 fire brigade vehicles and four rescue vehicles.\n\nThe PDMA provided 28 de-watering sets, five suction pumps, six tractors and as many jetting machines to Wasa.\n\nAnother five de-watering sets, seven mini trucks and three jetting machines were given to the Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation (RMC), the statement added.\n\nThe Pakistan Army rescued a family stranded in the flood on Rawalpindi’s Chakri Road using a helicopter, Radio Pakistan reported.\n\nPunjab’s Chakwal district was among the heaviest hit by the recent rains as it recorded 400 millimetres of rain overnight due to a cloudburst, triggering flash floods across the city, a statement from the PDMA said.\n\n“Chawkwal recorded 400mm of rain in 10 hours, which left many areas flooded,” the PDMA said in a statement issued in the early hours of Wednesday.\n\nHowever, a rainfall record issued by it at 8am stated 142mm of rainfall in the previous 24 hours.\n\nFootage aired by DawnNewsTV showed water gushing across vast swathes of land, with floodwater entering various buildings, including a Rescue 1122 office.\n\nIn a statement, the PDMA said water levels had begun to recede with the cessation of the downpour, and evacuation efforts were underway to rescue trapped citizens.\n\nDG Kathia spoke on the phone with Chakwal Deputy Commissioner Sarah Hayat, who briefed the former on the relief efforts.\n\nShe said the relevant departments, including Wasa, Rescue 1122 and other civil personnel, were present on the ground to take part in the rescue operation.\n\nRelief arrangements had been made in hospitals and public buildings, Hayat said.\n\nDG Kathia assured Hayat of providing all possible resources and assistance, according to the PDMA statement. He added that the district administration was in contact with the army as well for additional support.\n\n“The district administration is continuing to monitor the situation, particularly in low-lying areas.”\n\nDistrict Emergency Operation Centre, including the PDMA Control Room, were on high alert, he said, adding that “helicopters and other rescue resources” were also on standby.\n\nDC Hayat announced a flood emergency in Chakwal and Talagang. She directed all officers to remain present at the place of their duty for 24 hours and the leaves of all officers and employees were cancelled.\n\nThe DC also directed officials to ensure the availability of required machinery, equipment and staff to Rescue 1122. DC Hayat, along with District Police Officer Ahmed Mohiuddin, visited the affected areas and supervised the rescue operations and relief work.\n\nScores of mini dams built by private individuals were washed away by the torrents, inundating many villages. Budhial village was submerged after a mini-dam was wrecked in Ghokal village.\n\n“I have never witnessed such kind of flooding in my village”, Prof Syed Ali Raza from Budhial told Dawn.com. He added that five to six feet of rainwater accumulated in the houses, forcing people to leave their homes. The bridge on the road which connects Budhial to the rest of the area was also swept away, cutting off the village from the rest of the area.\n\n“Three cattle were also swept away and still could not be found,” he said.\n\nAdditional Deputy Commissioner Bilal Bin Abdul Hafeez said that the exact cause of the unprecedented rain could not be ascertained yet.\n\n“However, this situation has occurred possibly due to two factors. The first one could be a cloudburst, and the second one could be the shifting of the confluence of eastern and western winds to Chakwal from Kallar Kahar. Until now, the confluence of eastern and western winds was being considered near Kallar Kahar, but Kallar Kahar and neighbouring Choa Saidan Shah did not witness such heavy downpour as it was witnessed in Chakwal city and twenty km to its eastern belt,” he maintained.\n\nChakwal and Talagang have 24 small dams and due to the prolonged drought, the water level in all dams has decreased to a dead level. “All the small dams in Chakwal and Talagang are safe and they are operating as per their structure,” Executive Engineer Small Dams Division Naeemul Hassan told Dawn.com. He added that all the dams were filled 80 per cent.\n\nThe NDMA has forecasted more heavy rains over the next 24 hours, Radio Pakistan reported.\n\n“Various districts in Punjab — including Lahore, Chakwal, Attock, Jhelum, Khushab, Sargodha, Gujrat, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, Sialkot, Narowal, Okara, Kasur, Sheikhupura, and Hafizabad — are likely to experience thunderstorms and heavy rain in the next 12 hours,” the report read.\n\nAmid heavy rains and flooding in Punjab, authorities in the federal capital were also directed to remain on high alert by Islamabad Chief Commissioner Muhammad Ali Randhawa.\n\n“Field teams should provide all possible assistance to citizens in case of an emergency,” Randhawa, also the Capital Development Authority (CDA) chairman, said.\n\nThe chief commissioner directed that strict monitoring of all highways, drains and waterways of Islamabad should be ensured.\n\nIn case of any emergency, citizens were advised to contact the CDA and district administration on 16 and 1334, respectively.\n\nSeparately, heavy downpour in Mandi Bahauddin left one dead and injured 11 people on Wednesday, rescue officials said. According to the PMD, Mandi Bahauddin recorded 167mm of rainfall in 24 hours up till 8am.\n\nShah Hussain, aged 10, drowned while bathing in the rainwater, while in another incident, two boys — eight-year-old Qasim and six-year-old Huzaifa — were injured due to electrocution during the rain.\n\nNine people were injured after the roofs of three dilapidated houses collapsed at separate locations in Mandi Bahauddin. College Chowk, Pindi Purani, Jail Chowk and several other areas remained submerged under 2-4ft of water.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the NDMA chair and federal ministers for climate change and planning to work together with the provinces for developing a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.\n\nThe prime minister visited the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) at the NDMA headquarters, where he was briefed on the country’s monsoon situation, disaster response efforts, and the increasing intensity of weather patterns.\n\nPM Shehbaz commended the NDMA’s efforts and lauded the role of modern technology and skilled human resources at the authority.\n\n“NDMA always provides an encouraging environment, and it is because of its modern infrastructure and highly capable team. This is my second visit here, and I am pleased to see the dedication.”\n\nThe prime minister highlighted recent cloudbursts and heavy downpours in Chakwal, Lahore, Islamabad, and hilly areas, acknowledging the severity of weather conditions. He remarked that while southern parts of the country saw less rainfall impact, the northern and central regions continue to face significant risk.\n\n“As projections show increased cloudburst activity, we must prepare accordingly. The federal government and NDMA must maintain close coordination with provinces,” PM Shehbaz said.\n\nThe prime minister pledged full support from the PM Office in procuring the necessary disaster response equipment and emphasised the importance of federal-provincial cooperation in strengthening human resources, capacity building, and equipment for rescue and relief operations.\n\n“Pakistan contributes minimally to global greenhouse gas emissions but ranks among the top ten most climate-vulnerable countries. This is a challenge, but also an opportunity to build a climate-resilient nation, especially in agriculture and infrastructure.”\n\nWith an urgent call for a unified national response and long-term climate adaptation, PM Shehbaz concluded his visit by reiterating the federal government’s commitment to protecting lives, property, and infrastructure in the face of intensifying climate challenges.\n\nMeanwhile, the district administration of Jhelum dispelled the rumours of flooding in the river Jhelum.\n\nThe press release from the district information department said that the inflow of water in Mangla lake and its storage level were being monitored, and there was no imminent danger of overflooding from the dam, as its current level was 1186 feet against a storage capacity of 1,242 feet.\n\nThe deputy commissioner clarified to the residents of the area that the current flooding was a result of a heavy downpour that continued during the last 36 hours.\n\n“The low-lying areas of Gujar Khan tehsil, including Gujar Khan city, Daultala, and Hassal village, were also flooded, while the local administration remained on alert and no casualties were reported,” Hamza Ehtisham, the assistant commissioner of Gujar Khan, confirmed.",
