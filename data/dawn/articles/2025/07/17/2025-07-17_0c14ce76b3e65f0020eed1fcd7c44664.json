I convey this same message to the people of Pakistan: under no circumstances should you submit to this tyrannical system. The time for negotiations has passed. What remains now is the time for the nation to rise in protest,” read the tweet posted on Mr Khan’s account.\n\nHe said hardships inflicted upon him in jail had “intensified in the recent days”, claiming the same was true for his wife Bushra Bibi. “All fundamental human rights and basic prisoner entitlements, both mine and hers, have been suspended. This must be accou­­nted for,” he said in the tweet.\n\n“At this time, many, including myself, are enduring some of the harshest imprisonments. Therefore, I direct every member of the party to put aside all personal grievances. Publicly airing internal matters or individual concerns before the media is entirely unacceptable,” he said.\n\nHe urged the party workers and leaders to focus on the protest movement, warning that those who fail to do so would answer to him.\n\n“If any party official fails to participate in this movement, I will make the final decision about them myself, even from jail.\n\nI instruct all party members and office-bearers to personally retweet my messages on Twitter (now X), and ensure they are shared as extensively as possible. The party should decide on nominations for the Senate tickets through mutual consultation,“ the post on X said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 17th, 2025",
