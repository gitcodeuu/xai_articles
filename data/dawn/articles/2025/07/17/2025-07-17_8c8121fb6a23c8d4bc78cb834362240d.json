  "content": "KHYBER: The deadlock over actual contents of ‘country of origin certificate’ for import of coal and soapstone from Afghanistan has caused suspension of custom clearance of both minerals at Torkham, inflicting huge financial losses on local importers.\n\nCoal and soapstone importers at Torkham told Dawn that the weeklong suspension of custom clearance resulted in stranding of about 700 loaded vehicles on both sides of the border while another 900 vehicles of coal and soapstone were stranded at Kharlaachi border in Kurram tribal district.\n\nThey said that for a legitimate clearance of both coal and soapstone at any border with Afghanistan, importers were required to include the names of both local importer and Afghan exporter along with actual weight and value of the consignment in the country of origin certificate.\n\nAccording to Jamshed Khan, a local coal importer, they have been in constant touch with Afghan custom authorities in Kabul, local authorities at Torkham and even the ministry of commerce in Islamabad for prompt resolution of the issue of contents of the country of origin certificate as the new conditions have badly hampered coal and soapstone import during the last few months.\n\nDeadlock persists over ‘country of origin certificate’ for import of coal and soapstone\n\nHe said that they had to an extent succeeded in resolving the issue of inclusion of importer and exporter names in the certificate but the determination of actual weight and value were a thorny issue due to different custom valuation and scanning process in Kabul and Torkham.\n\nHe said that the weight of coal changed during transportation from Kabul to Torkham both due to weather conditions and slippages or falling of coal during long distance travelling. He said that Afghan authorities were quoting their own weight while custom authorities at Torkham would not agree to clear the vehicle due to accidental reduction in weight, which in most cases was out of control of both the importer and the transporter.\n\n“The valuation too is an issue as authorities in Kabul would argue that they already have $100 fed to their computer system while the actual value is either $85 or maximum $90,” he said. He added that a difference in value was also hampering the clearing process.\n\nMujeebullah Shinwari, president of Torkhum Custom Clearing Agents Association, told Dawn that his association held consultations with Taliban government in Kabul but it was unable to resolve the issue of weight and value.\n\nHe said that unless the Afghan government agreed to rectify its custom clearance of export process for coal and soapstone, the issue would linger on, much to the disappointment of local importers and transporters.\n\nHe said that a delegation of coal and soapstone importers also met prime minister’s special assistance on trade and the special representative for Afghanistan, Sadiq Khan, in Islamabad and apprised him of the issues in clearance of both the minerals imported from Afghanistan.\n\nTerming the meeting fruitful, he said that former ambassador Sadiq Khan assured them of his full cooperation in first clearing the backlog of stranded vehicles and then finding an amicable solution to the issue with both the Afghan authorities and the FBR officials in Islamabad.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistani authorities have once again extended deadline for acquisition of visa by Afghan transporters and allowed them to avail ‘temporary admission document’ facility for their entry to Pakistan via Torkham till the end of July.\n\nIt was for the second time that Pakistan extended the deadline for availing TAD on the request of Afghan consulate officials in Peshawar owing to difficulties in acquisition of Pakistani visa by Afghan transporters both in Kabul and Jalalabad.\n\nThe TAD facility was introduced in May last year for a period of one year for those Afghan transporters, who were without their national passport and Pakistani visa.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 17th, 2025",
