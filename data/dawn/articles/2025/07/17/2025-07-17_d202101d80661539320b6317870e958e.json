A few days ago, she was bitten by a poisonous insect on her foot, due to which she remained unwell for a week,” he said.\n\n“Despite all the odds and sufferings, both Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi remain steadfast and resilient,” he said, adding that Imran Khan was strong and firm and his spirits could not be diminished by torturing his better half.\n\nSaif said he discussed the Senate polls and the ongoing protest with Imran Khan, who took a strong exception to the rifts in the party, and ordered to launch a nationwide protest movement.\n\nHe also issued strict instructions that all leaders should refrain from issuing statements or launching social media campaigns against each other.\n\nHe also emphasised that all leaders must remain united and focused on the protest movement, giving firm directions to the chief minister and other party leaders to immediately begin the protest movement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 17th, 2025",
