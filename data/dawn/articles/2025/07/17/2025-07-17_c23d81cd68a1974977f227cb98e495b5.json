It was further revealed that nine police personnel had been recruited on the basis of domiciles from outside the Karachi region.\n\nAs per the Sindh Civil Servants Rules, posts in grades 1 and 2 are to be filled on a local basis, while those in grades 3 to 15, who serve only within a particular region or district, should be filled by persons domiciled in the district concerned.\n\nThe PAC meeting, attended among others by committee members Khurram Karim Soomro and Taha Ahmed, Additional IG Muzaffar Ali Sheikh, DIG Finance Tanveer Odho, and DIG Traffic Pir Muhammad Shah, reviewed the audit reports of the police department for 2020 and 2021.\n\nDG Audit Sindh raised objections, saying that individuals holding identity cards from KP, FATA, Punjab, Balochistan and Islamabad were receiving salaries amounting to Rs17.405m from the Sindh provincial police department.\n\nDIG Finance Tanveer Odho told the PAC that these recruitments had taken place between 1979 and 2015 and that the police department had inquired into the recruitment of 196 personnel.\n\nThe PAC chairman said that recruitment on fake domiciles would not be tolerated under any circumstances. “Why have the police personnel with fake domiciles or domiciles from other provinces not been dismissed from service?” he asked.\n\nDIG Odho informed the PAC that departmental action had been initiated against such officials and show-cause notices had been issued to them. “However, they will be dismissed from service after the procedure is completed,” he assured the committee.\n\nThe DG Audit also raised concerns about irregularities in petrol expenditures for vehicles used by the DIG Traffic and subordinate offices.\n\nThe traffic police chief informed the PAC that a petrol budget of Rs85m had been allocated, which was spent through Pakistan State Oil (PSO) and that complete records of the vehicles for which petrol was used were available. The committee ordered an inquiry into the use of such amount of petrol allocation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 17th, 2025",
