He also stated that two other people witnessed the incident, who reached there after hearing the gunshots.\n\nDistrict Police Officer (DPO) Javed Iqbal Chaddar told Dawn.com that police rushed to the scene after receiving an emergency call.\n\n“I entered the premises and confronted Maneka, taking him into custody,” he said, adding that the suspect was currently held at the Saddar Police station and that the police had recovered the pistol which was used in the incident.\n\nRescue 1122 immediately took the injured servant to District Headquarters Hospital Pakpattan for medical treatment, he said.\n\nDPO Chaddar said that “no one is above the law”, adding that the suspect “would not be spared”.\n\nToday is not the suspect’s only run-in with the law. He and his father Khawar Maneka and elder brother were indicted in corruption cases in a reference filed by the Okara deputy commissioner on Aug 23, 2023.\n\nPolice also registered an FIR against him on charges of possession of liquor in February 2022.",
