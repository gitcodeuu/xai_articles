  "content": "ISLAMABAD: A parliamentary panel, while discussing the recent O/A level paper leak issue on Wednesday, said the administration of Cambridge International Examinations (CIE) in Pakistan should adhere to full compliance with national laws and regulations, particularly the Inter Boards Coordination Commission (IBCC) Act 2023.\n\nNational Assembly Standing Committee on Federal Education, which met at the Parliament House with Dr Azimuddin Zahid Lakhvi in the chair, besides other agenda items, discussed the issue of the recent paper leaks of O/A level and a report compiled by a subcommittee on this issue.\n\nDuring its recent proceedings, the committee received and reviewed the report from its subcommittee on Cambridge examination leaks, headed by MNA Sabheen Ghoury, which presented detailed findings and concrete recommendations.\n\nThe subcommittee’s report presented a thorough analysis of the CIE paper leak, along with actionable policy recommendations to strengthen oversight mechanisms.\n\nEmphasises creation of regulatory framework to oversee foreign examination boards operating in country\n\nThe committee emphasised the creation of a comprehensive regulatory framework to oversee all foreign examination boards operating in the country, including CIE.\n\nThe committee raised serious concerns about the lack of formal agreements between CIE and the Ministry of Federal Education.\n\nIt also underlined that under provisions of the IBCC Act 2023, all international examination boards must now formally register with the IBCC and comply with its standardised framework.\n\nCIE has offered free November 2025 resits for candidates who took the three impacted June 2025 exam papers. The committee was told that resits are optional; schools will receive entry instructions after June results are released. The Cambridge, in its probe, had stated that three partial papers were leaked.\n\nHowever, in its report, the subcommittee criticised Cambridge’s assertion that only a partial leak occurred, arguing that if specific questions from multiple papers were compromised, the possibility of full papers leaked cannot be ignored.\n\nFurther, it recommended that CIE must implement corrective measures before July 25 to address the exam paper leak, ensuring affected students can secure university admission without facing academic setbacks.\n\n“The committee recommended that the CIE either adjust the grade threshold to compensate affected students or conduct retake examination with results released by August 11. Should neither option be feasible, CIE must propose and implement an alternative fair solution at the earliest.\n\nThe report of the subcommittee further said: “While offering free resist in November 2025 is a step forward, Cambridge must ensure these exams are leak-proof and that students receive adequate preparation resources.”\n\nIt also recommended that the Rs60,000 fee per Cambridge exam paper in Pakistan should be reviewed and rationalised by the Ministry of Education and CIE. “The fee must balance affordability for students, operational costs and global benchmark,” the report added.\n\nMeanwhile, the committee passed various legislative proposals on its agenda that include The Orbit Institute of Management and Technology Bill, 2025; The Al-Biruni International University Bill, 2025; The Wah Institute of Modern Sciences, Wah Cantt Bill, 2025; and The Rawal International University, Islamabad Bill, 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, the committee expressed serious concerns regarding the prolonged delay in the appointment of the director general of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE).\n\nSimilarly, the committee also expressed grave concerns over the occupation of multiple buildings belonging to the Directorate General of Special Education (DGSE) by various institutions, including the Piera, Federal Medical and Dental College (FMDC), and Pakistan Baitul Mal.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 17th, 2025",
