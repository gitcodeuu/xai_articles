  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) has requested the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) to extend the deadline for filing sales tax returns for June, citing frequent portal downtimes and persistent login failures on the IRIS system.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the FBR chairman, the KTBA highlighted operational hurdles faced by taxpayers, consultants, and corporate entities under the current authentication mechanism of the IRIS portal, particularly concerning compliance with the sales tax regime.\n\nWhile supporting the FBR’s efforts to enhance security, the KTBA noted that the requirement to send QR codes solely to a taxpayer’s registered mobile number has created practical barriers. This is especially problematic for overseas taxpayers who are often unable to receive SMS messages originating from Pakistan.\n\nCorporate taxpayers also face difficulties when the registered mobile number is held by a director or authorised employee who may be unavailable during filing deadlines. Furthermore, legally authorised representatives — such as e-intermediaries, accountants, and consultants — are unable to file returns or ensure compliance on behalf of clients despite holding legal authorisation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 17th, 2025",
