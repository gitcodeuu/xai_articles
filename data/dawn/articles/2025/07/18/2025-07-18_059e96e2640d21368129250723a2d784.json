  "content": "US President Donald Trump threatened to sue The Wall Street Journal on Thursday over a story about an alleged off-colour letter he wrote to Jeffrey Epstein, amid lingering political fallout over his administration’s handling of the late financier’s sex trafficking case.\n\nThe Journal story says the letter featuring a sketch of a naked woman and Trump’s signature was part of a collection of notes for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003.\n\nThe newspaper says it reviewed the letter but did not print an image.\n\nWall Street Journal editor-in-chief Emma Tucker “was told directly by (White House press secretary) Karoline Leavitt, and by President Trump, that the letter was a FAKE,” Trump wrote in a post on his Truth Social network.\n\n“Instead, they are going with a false, malicious, and defamatory story anyway,” he said.\n\n“President Trump will be suing The Wall Street Journal, NewsCorp, and Mr. (Rupert) Murdoch, shortly. The press has to learn to be truthful, and not rely on sources that probably don’t even exist.”\n\nThe Republican president was already facing a firestorm over his past relationship with Epstein, and claims that his administration is covering up lurid details of Epstein’s crimes to protect rich and powerful figures.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 — during Trump’s first term — after being charged with federal sex trafficking in a scheme where he allegedly groomed young and underage women for sexual abuse by his wealthy contacts.\n\nHe was previously required to register as a sex offender in Florida after pleading guilty to two felony prostitution-related charges.\n\nLater on Thursday, Trump asked Attorney General Pam Bondi to release transcripts of grand jury testimony in the Epstein case, “subject to court approval”.\n\nThe alleged letter — which Trump denies writing — is raunchy, as were others in the collection, the Journal reported. It contains several lines of typewritten text, contained in an outline of a naked woman drawn with a marker.\n\n“The future president’s signature is a squiggly ‘Donald’ below her waist, mimicking pubic hair,” the Journal reported.\n\n“The letter concludes: ‘Happy Birthday — and may every day be another wonderful secret.’”\n\nTrump denied writing the letter or drawing the figure, telling the Journal: “This is not me. This is a fake thing.”\n\n“I don’t draw pictures of women,” he said. “It’s not my language. It’s not my words.”\n\nMurdoch, who controls the NewsCorp global media company, was in Trump’s suite on Sunday at MetLife Stadium outside New York City for the FIFA Club World Cup final.\n\nThe Trump-supporting far-right has long latched onto the Epstein scandal, claiming the existence of a still-secret client list and that he was murdered in his cell as part of a cover-up.\n\nTrump supporters expected the Republican to answer their questions on his return to office in January, but now find themselves being told the conspiracy theories are false.\n\nThe Justice Department and FBI said in a memo made public earlier this month that there is no evidence that Epstein kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful people.\n\nThey also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.\n\nThat could change if grand jury testimony or evidence are released.\n\nOn Thursday, US media reported that a federal prosecutor who handled Epstein’s case, who is the daughter of a prominent Trump critic, was abruptly fired.\n\nMaurene Comey, whose father is former FBI director James Comey, was dismissed on Wednesday from her position as an assistant US attorney in Manhattan, the reports said.\n\nComey also prosecuted Ghislaine Maxwell, the only former Epstein associate who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.\n\nMaxwell is the person who compiled the leather-bound book of letters for Epstein in 2003, The Journal reported.\n\n“The WSJ should be ashamed for publishing it. Where is this letter? Would you be shocked to learn they never showed it to us before publishing it?” Vice President JD Vance wrote on X.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmaker Pat Ryan wrote: “I think we now know EXACTLY why Donald Trump refuses to release the Epstein files.”",
