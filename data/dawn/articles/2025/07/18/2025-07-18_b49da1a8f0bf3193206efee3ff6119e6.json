TV footage showed him sitting receiving treatment at Al-Ahly Hospital in Gaza, with a bandage around his lower right leg.\n\nPope Leo said in a statement that he was “deeply saddened” by the loss of life and renewed his appeal for an immediate ceasefire, while Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said attacks on civilians were unacceptable.\n\nThe Israeli military said it was looking into the incident. Israel’s foreign ministry said in a statement on X that the re­­sults of the investigation wou­­ld be published. It also said the country did not target churches or religious sites and regretted harm to them or civilians.\n\nPalestinian medics said one air strike on Thursday had killed a man, his wife and their five children in Jabalia in northern Gaza, and that another in the north had killed eight men who had been handed responsibility for protecting aid trucks.\n\nThree people were killed in an airstrike in central Gaza and four in Zeitoun in eastern Gaza, medics said.\n\nCeasefire talks\n\nArab mediators Qatar and Egypt, backed by the United States, have hosted more than 10 days of talks on a proposed US 60-day truce.\n\nAs part of the potential deal, 10 prisoners held in Gaza would be returned along with the bodies of 18 others, spread out over 60 days. In exchange, Israel would release detained Palestinians. The exact number is not clear.\n\nA Hamas source with knowledge of the matter said Israel had presented new maps to the mediators, pledging to pull the army further back than had previously been offered. The source said this partially met Hamas’ demands, but was still insufficient.\n\nDisputes also remain over aid delivery mechanisms into Gaza, and guarantees that any eventual truce would lead to ending the war, said the two other Hamas officials who spoke to Reuters.\n\nIsrael has told the mediators it is willing to drop its demand to maintain a military presence along the so-called Morag Corri­dor in southern Gaza during a ceasefire and is prepared to show flexibility regarding the size of the security buffer it would retain near the Israeli border, Israeli media reported.\n\nPrime Minister Benja­min Netanyahu’s office did not immediately comment on the reports.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 18th, 2025",
