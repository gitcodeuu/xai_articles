  "content": "BEIRUT: Two people were killed on Thursday in separate Israeli strikes on south Lebanon, the Lebanese health ministry said, in the latest attacks despite a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah.\n\nThe ministry said that “an Israeli drone strike targeted a car” in the Nabatiyeh district, killing one person and wounding two others.\n\nAnother strike “targeted a truck in the town of Naqura” in southern Lebanon “resulting in one martyr,” it said in a statement. The Israeli army did not immediately comment on the incidents.\n\nIsrael has repeatedly bombed Lebanon despite a November ceasefire seeking to end over a year of hostilities with Lebanese group Hezbollah.\n\nUnder the agreement, Hezbollah was to pull its fighters back north of the Litani river, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the Israeli border, leaving the Lebanese army and United Nations peacekeepers as the only armed parties in the region.\n\nIsrael was required to fully withdraw its troops from the country but has kept them in five places it deems strategic.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 18th, 2025",
