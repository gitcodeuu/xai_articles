Justice Mohammad Asif is also availing summer vacations.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, IHC CJ Dogar highlighted the steps taken for swift disposal of cases, saying that specialised benches had been constituted for speedy disposal of cases related to those who are already behind bars.\n\nJustice Dogar said that cases related to overseas Pakistanis will also be given priority, while special attention was being paid to reducing the IHC and district judiciary’s backlog.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 18th, 2025",
