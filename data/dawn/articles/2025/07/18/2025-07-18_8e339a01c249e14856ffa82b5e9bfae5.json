It commended the Ministry of Defence and the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority (PCAA) for facilitating the development.\n\nUrges flag and logo retention, protection of workers’ rights\n\nDuring the meeting, the panel reviewed PIA’s operational status and discussed broader strategies to strengthen the aviation sector. The PIACL director-general briefed the committee on fleet development, organisational structure, and plans for expanding domestic and international networks.\n\nNoting positive management steps aimed at reclaiming the airline’s lost stature, members voiced concern over the continued absence of domestic flight operations, which they said affects mobility for a large segment of the population.
