These people had taken refuge on elevated points and the roofs of their houses to escape floodwaters. The Jhelum DC separately told Dawn that the rescue operation was still in progress in several areas, including the search for the missing policeman who was swept away in Jhelum.\n\nIn Chakwal, two people were killed and two were missing, while in Rawalpindi, two people were also missing, with search operations underway for their recovery. The Leh Nullah in Rawalpindi rose to the ‘danger level’, putting millions of people living along its banks at flood risk, but the water subsided after the rain stopped.\n\nAccording to the Met Office, rain-wind/thundershower is expected at Isolated places in Kashmir, Northeast Punjab, Potohar region and Upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\n“Rain-wind/thundershower is also expected at isolated places in Northeast/South Balochistan, Southern Punjab, Upper/Southeast Sindh during evening/night,” the Met office said, adding that “light to moderate monsoon currents are penetrating upper parts and likely to continue penetrating during next 12 to 18 hours”.\n\nAccording to a ‘fact sheet’ issued by the PDMA, the third series of monsoon rains was ended on July 17 and the water flow in most rivers and barrages of Punjab was at normal level. “Mangla Dam has 47 per cent water, Tarbela 79pc and Indian dams are about 34pc. There is a possibility of medium flood at Rasool Barrage in the River Jhelum. There is a low flood situation at Tarbela in river Indus,” it said.\n\nRescue sources said that due to the heavy rain after the cloud burst in neighbouring Chakwal district, the storm water channels in the Jhelum district, including Ghan and Bunna Nullahs faced a sudden flood and the adjoining residential localities were badly affected, causing an emergency situation.\n\n‘More rain to come’\n\nAs rains ravage the country, the prime minister visited the National Emergencies Operation Centre (NEOC) at the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority (NDMA) headquarters, where he was apprised that five more such spells of rains are expected in the days to come.\n\n“The prime minister was informed that three spells of monsoon have arrived so far, while the fourth is expected from July 21 to 28, the fifth in the first week of August, the sixth in the second week, and the seventh in the third week,” said a statement issued by the state-run APP about the premier’s visit.\n\nHe said that heavy rain was expected in Rawalpindi and Islamabad tonight. PM Shehbaz directed the National Disaster Man­agement Authority and the climate and planning ministers to engage the provinces for a comprehensive disaster management plan based on the lessons learnt from this year’s devastating rains and cloudburst events.\n\nNDMA Chairman Lieutenant General Inam Haider Malik informed the PM this year’s monsoon intensity “is 60–70 per cent higher than last year, and averaging 65 per cent more than anticipated across the region”.\n\n“While last year’s projections had indicated rising impacts in northern Punjab, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Islamabad, and upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, this year the brunt has shifted towards lower and upper Punjab, Islamabad, and AJK, with the trend expected to persist for the next three to four weeks,” the premier was informed.\n\nIt may be noted this year that 113 citizens died, 128 houses were affected and 398 citizens were injured due to monsoon rains. Most of the deaths were due to the collapse of mud houses, dilapidated buildings and roofs.\n\nMeanwhile, a torrential rain spell in Gilgit-Baltistan triggered landslides and flash floods in several areas of the mountainous region, disrupting power supply and causing road blocks. However, the significant dip in temperature due to rainfall has minimised the risk of glacial lake outburst flood (Glof). Fortunately, no loss of human lives was reported.\n\nSyed Irfan Raza in Islamabad, Waseem Ashraf Butt in Gujrat, Hamid Asghar in Gujar Khan, Imran Gabol in Lahore and Jamil Nagri in Gilgit-Baltistan also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 18th, 2025",
