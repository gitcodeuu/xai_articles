  "content": "TUNIS: Three-time Grand Slam finalist Ons Jabeur is taking a break from competitive tennis, the 30-year-old said in a social media post on Thursday.\n\nTunisia’s Jabeur, the first Arab woman to reach a Grand Slam final, has struggled with her form in recent months, failing to get past the third round of a major this year.\n\nThe two-time Wimbledon finalist’s campaign came to a disappointing end at the All England Club last month as she retired from her first-round clash against Viktoriya Tomova, unable to continue after a long medical timeout.\n\nThe former world number two suffers from asthma and experienced breathing difficulties at this year’s Australian Open.\n\nJabeur, often called the ‘minister of happiness’ for her cheerful personality, said she was not feeling truly happy on the court.\n\n“For the past two years, I’ve been pushing myself so hard, fighting through injuries and facing many other challenges. But deep down, I haven’t truly felt happy on the court for some time now,” she said in a statement.\n\n“Tennis is such a beautiful sport. But right now, I feel it’s time to take a step back and finally put myself first: to breathe, to heal, and to rediscover the joy of simply living.”\n\nJabeur, married to former fencer Karim Kamoun, has also been open about her wish to start a family.\n\n“Thank you to all my fans for understanding. Your support and love mean the world to me. I carry it with me always,” she added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 18th, 2025",
