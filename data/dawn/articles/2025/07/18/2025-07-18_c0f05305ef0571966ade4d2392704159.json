We have reached a consensus with the op­­­position (on certain issues),” he said.\n\nHe added that in future, there would be no use of abusive language, sloganeering or disruptions during assembly proceedings. “When the opposition leader speaks, there will be no sloganeering. Similarly, there will be no disruptions during the chief minister’s speech. The house will operate according to the recommendations of the Business Advisory Committee,” he noted.\n\nMr Rehman also said the Ethics Com­m­ittee would be made functional and tasked with reviewing any violations of the assembly’s rules of procedure after each session.\n\nHe claimed the opposition had not raised the issue of reinstating suspended lawmakers. However, the assertion was rebutted by opposition leader Ahmad Khan Bhachar. Speaking to the media separately, he said, “We will never enter the house without our suspended colleagues.”\n\nMr Bhachar confirmed that both sides had exchanged proposals and agreed on reactivating the Advisory Committee and the Ethics Committee.\n\nHe emphasised that the house would be run under the framework of the Ethics Committee and Rule 223 of the Rules of Procedure, indicating a move towards more structured parliamentary proceedings.\n\nRegarding the heated exchanges that have plagued recent sessions, Mr Bhachar said the government acknowledged the opposition’s right to protest but stressed that abusive language is not a good practice. “We have never called it good either. Abu­sive language will not be tolerated,” he said.\n\nDespite these agreements on parliamentary decorum, the core demand of the opposition remains the reinstatement of their sus­p­ended members and the withdrawal of fines.\n\n“No one asked us for an apology, nor did we apologise,” Mr Bhachar said, warning: “If our people are not reinstated, the opposition will hold an assembly outside the (provincial) assembly.”\n\nHe stressed the opposition’s unwavering stance: “We are in the opposition; it never backs down from protest. If the government wants the opposition to come into the house, then they can reinstate [our members].”\n\nHe questioned the rationale behind any expectation of an apology. “Why would we apologise when our members are suspended and fined?” he asked. “Fines have not been waived and our people are still suspended. Until they are reinstated, we will not return to the house.” He also underlined a key constitutional right, stating: “No member can be deprived of their right to vote.”\n\nMeanwhile, Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ahmed Khan, who is abroad on a private trip, participated in the negotiating committee meeting via an audio link. He congratulated all members of the committee on the successful talks and reiterated the negotiation committee’s decision, particularly the agreement on not using indecent language.\n\nHe was quoted as saying that “the decisions of the Ethics Committee will be supreme” and urged that “the act of use of abusive language should not be repeated”.\n\nThe speaker affirmed that “the opposition has the right to protest, but according to the Constitution”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 18th, 2025",
