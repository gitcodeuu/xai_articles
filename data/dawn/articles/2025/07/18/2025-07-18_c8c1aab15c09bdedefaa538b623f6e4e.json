Three of them also have Afghan identity cards. They have been shifted to an undisclosed location for further interrogation.\n\nSecurity authorities have issued an alert in the border areas and are continuing search operations to stop potential terrorists, PTV added.\n\n“Security sources say that India is giving full support to the Khawarij separatist movement to fuel terrorism in Pakistan,” PTV News said.\n\nA police assistant sub-inspector (ASI) and a constable were injured when the Meryan police station in KP’s Bannu area was struck by terrorists with a quadcopter drone today.\n\nBannu District Police Officer (DPO) Saleem Abbas Kulachi told Dawn.com that this was the sixth time the police station was attacked by quadcopters, resulting in injuries to two police officials.\n\n“The injured ASI and police constable were moved to the district headquarters hospital for medical assistance,” DPO Kulachi said, adding that Meryan police station was “crucial for combating terrorists in the district”.\n\nThe DPO said that terrorists had started using quadcopters to target police infrastructure and personnel.\n\n“National unity and support are significantly needed to fight collectively against the terrorists and eliminate them,” the DPO said “Police alone cannot handle them without the cooperation of the public.”\n\nEarlier this month, security forces foiled an infiltration attempt from Afghanistan by an “Indian proxy”, killing at least 30 terrorists in North Waziristan district, ISPR had said.\n\nOn July 9, security forces killed eight militants attempting to infiltrate from Afghanistan into Bajaur district.\n\nOfficial sources said the militants were killed in Lowi Mamund tehsil after they tried to cross into the district from Afghanistan’s Kunar province.\n\nPakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).\n\nThe monthly security assessment shows there were a total of 78 militant attacks across the country in June, resulting in at least 100 fatalities, including 53 security personnel, 39 civilians, six militants, and two members of peace committees, the organisation said in a press statement.",
