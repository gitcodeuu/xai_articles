Currently, 75 per cent of our workforce is from Balochistan — the majority from Chagai district — and we aim to continue strengthening this local representation,” he added.\n\nIn addition to economic and educational initiatives, RDMC has invested in health services for the region. A health clinic and newly established Mother & Child Health Centre in Humai are delivering quality primary healthcare to villagers — marking the first time communities in the region have had access to a specialised maternal facility offering comprehensive pre- and postnatal care for women.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 15th, 2025",
