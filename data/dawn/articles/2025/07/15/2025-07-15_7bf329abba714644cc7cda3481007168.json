  "content": "WASHINGTON: Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday that Meta Platforms would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build several massive AI data centres for superintelligence, intensifying his pursuit of a technology he has chased with a talent war for top engineers.\n\nThe social media giant is among the large tech companies that have struck high-profile deals and doled out multi-million-dollar pay packages in recent months to fast-track work on machines that could outthink humans on many tasks.\n\nIts first multi-gigawatt data centre, dubbed Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, while another, called Hyperion, will be able to scale up to five gigawatts over the coming years, Zuckerberg said in a post on his Threads social media platform.\n\n“We’re building multiple more titan clusters as well. Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan,” the billionaire CEO said.\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s firm to build several massive AI data centres, with one set to come online next year\n\nHe also pointed to a report from industry publication SemiAnalysis that Meta was on track to be the first AI lab to bring a gigawatt-plus supercluster online.\n\nZuckerberg touted the strength in the company’s core advertising business to justify the massive spending amid investor concerns on whether the expenditure would pay off.\n\n“We have the capital from our business to do this,” he said.\n\nMeta shares were trading 1pc higher. The stock has risen more than 20pc so far this year.\n\nThe company, which generated nearly $165 billion in revenue last year, reorganised its AI efforts last month under a division called Superintelligence Labs after setbacks for its open-source Llama 4 model and key staff departures.\n\nIt is betting that the division would generate new cash flows from the Meta AI app, image-to-video ad tools and smart glasses.\n\nD.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said Meta was investing aggressively in AI as the technology has already boosted its ad business by allowing it to sell more ads and at higher prices.\n\n“But at this scale, the investment is more oriented to the long-term competition to have the leading AI model, which could take time to materialize,” Luria said.\n\nIn recent weeks, Zuckerberg has personally led an aggressive talent raid for the Meta Superintelligence Labs, which will be led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and ex-GitHub chief Nat Friedman, after Meta invested $14.3bn in Scale.\n\nMeta had raised its 2025 capital expenditure to between $64bn and $72bn in April, aiming to bolster the company’s position against rivals OpenAI and Google.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 15th, 2025",
