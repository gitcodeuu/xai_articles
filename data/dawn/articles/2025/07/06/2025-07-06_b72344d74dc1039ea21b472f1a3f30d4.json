The successes include the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire that was sealed after what he called the “flawless” US air strikes on Iran.\n\nPilots who carried out the bombing on Iran were among those invited to the White House event, which included a picnic for military families on the South Lawn.\n\n“The last two weeks, there has never been anything like it, as far as winning,” said Trump.\n\nTrump had however forced through the tax bill despite deep misgivings in the Republican Party that it would balloon the national debt. The legislation is expected to pile an extra $3.4 trillion over a decade onto the US deficit.\n\nIt squeezed past a final vote in the House of Representatives 218-214 after Republican Speaker Mike Johnson worked through the night to corral the final group of dissenters. Trump thanked Johnson at the White House event, saying: “What a job.”\n\nDemocrats and many voters have meanwhile expressed concerns that the “big beautiful bill” will slash health and welfare support.\n\nThe bill will force through the largest cuts to the Medicaid health insurance programme for low-income Americans since its 1960s launch, while also shrinking federal food assistance programs.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 6th, 2025",
