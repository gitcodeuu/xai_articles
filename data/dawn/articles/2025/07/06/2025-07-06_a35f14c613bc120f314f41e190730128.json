  "content": "JERUSALEM: The United States on Saturday blamed Hamas for an attack that injured two American aid workers from the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) at a food distribution site in Gaza.\n\nThe US- and Israeli-backed GHF said in a statement that the injured Americans were receiving medical treatment and were in a stable condition with non-life-threatening injuries.\n\n“The attack which preliminary information indicates was carried out by two assailants who threw two grenades at the Americans occurred at the conclusion of an otherwise successful distribution in which thousands of Gazans safely received food,” the GHF said.\n\nState Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce blamed Hamas for the attack.\n\n“This act of violence against the people actually bringing relief to Gazans lays bare the depravity of Hamas,” she said in a post on X.\n\n“GHF has contributed over 62 MILLION MEALS — nothing will stop these courageous aid workers. We are praying for the rapid recovery of the injured Americans.” The Israeli military earlier accused what it called “terrorist organisations” of sabotaging the distribution of aid in Gaza.\n\nGHF, which began distributing aid in Gaza in May, employs private US military contractors to provide security at their sites.\n\nGaza has seen an escalation in violence as efforts continue to reach a ceasefire agreement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 6th, 2025",
