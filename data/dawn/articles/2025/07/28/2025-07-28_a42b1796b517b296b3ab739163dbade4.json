  "content": "QUETTA: In an effort to eradicate poliovirus and strengthen immunity among children in vulnerable regions, Balochistan has launc­hed a week-long Fractional Inacti­vated Polio Vaccine (FIPV) campaign, running from today (Monday).\n\nThe immunisation drive targets 585,490 children between the ages of 4 and 59 months across 123 high-risk Union Councils in Quetta, Pishin, Chaman, Dera Bugti, Duki, Zhob, and Killa Abdullah. The initiative is part of a broader strategy to stop virus transmission and reinforce protection among young children.\n\nA total of 1,835 vaccination teams have been deployed for the campaign. The FIPV will be administered alongside the Oral Polio Vacc­ine (OPV), which is given to children from birth to 59 months of age.\n\nHealth experts have noted that FIPV acts as a critical booster dose, particularly effective for children with weakened immune systems due to malnutrition or recurrent illnesses, who may not respond adequately to OPV alone.\n\nInamul Haq, the coordinator of the Emergency Operations Centre , Balochistan, urged parents to ensure their children receive the vaccine.\n\nHe emphasised that FIPV is both safe and highly effective, calling it an essential step in preventing permanent disabilities caused by polio.\n\nTo ensure the safety of health workers, the provincial government has put in place robust security arrangements. Authorities have also appealed to the media to counter misinformation and raise public awareness to increase community participation in the campaign\n\nWith Balochistan continuing to be a critical front in Pakistan’s polio eradication efforts, health officials stress the need for sustained and coordinated vaccination campaigns to eliminate the virus once and for all.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
