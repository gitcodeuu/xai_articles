More than 100 NGOs warned last week of “mass starvation” in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory.\n\nSix deaths were reported over the past 24 hours due to malnutrition, bringing the total toll from hunger to 133, including 87 children. A Jordanian official told Reu­ters that airdrops were not a substitute for delivery by land to feed the starving populace which faced Israel-manufactured famine for weeks.\n\nPalestinian health officials in Gaza City said at least 10 people were injured by falling aid boxes; however, most were happy about the prospects of finally getting a meal.\n\n“People are happy that large amounts of food aid will come into Gaza,” said Tamer Al-Burai, a business owner. “We hope today marks a first step in ending this war that burned everything up.”.\n\nHumeid, a 23-year-old from the Al-Karama neighbourhood of Gaza City, told AFP that dozens of people had gathered to rush towards the palettes of supplies parachuted onto the area.\n\n“It felt like a war, everyone trying to grab whatever they could. Hunger is merciless. The quantities were extremely limited, not enough even for a few people, because hunger is everywhere. I only managed to get three cans of fava beans,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Egyptian Red Crescent said it was sending more than 100 trucks carrying over 1,200 metric tonnes of food to southern Gaza on Sunday. A Palestinian official source said on Sunday afternoon that the trucks were still being inspected at Kerem Shalom and had not yet entered Gaza.\n\nThe desperation for food was evident from the fact that seven to 10 trucks filled with flour, which were allowed into the northern part of the Gaza Strip, could not all make it to Gaza City.\n\nHungry crowds surrounded them, and people who were desperate for one bag of flour and other basic necessities mobbed them, Al Jazeera reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Al Jazeera also reported that more than 53 people were killed by Israeli fire, including 32 who had been waiting to receive aid.\n\nMilitary operations ‘paused’\n\nThe aid drops came amid an announcement by Israel that it would ‘pause’ its military operations in parts of Gaza for 10 hours a day, and allow new aid corridors.\n\nThe military said designated secure routes for convoys delivering food and medicine will also be in place between 6am and 11pm, starting from Sunday.\n\nMilitary activity will stop from 10 am to 8 pm (0700-1700 GMT) until further notice in Al-Mawasi, a designated humanitarian area along the coast, in central Deir al-Balah and in Gaza City, to the north.\n\nThe Israeli military also said it had also begun airdropping food into the Palestinian territory – making one drop of seven palettes.\n\nHamas denounced the Israeli measures to allow more aid into Gaza, saying Israel was continuing its military offensive. “What is happening isn’t a humanitarian truce,” said Hamas official Ali Baraka in a statement on Sunday.\n\nInternational concern\n\nWhile Israel’s decision to pause military operations and allow aid into Gaza were welcomed, most actors agreed the actions fall short of what is needed to alleviate suffering in the besieged enclave.\n\nBritain’s Foreign Secretary David Lammy said that Israel’s announcement was “essential but long overdue”, and that access to aid must now be urgently accelerated over the coming hours and days.\n\nUN emergency relief coordinator Tom Fletcher said their teams would “do all we can to reach as many starving people as we can in this window”.\n\nUN rights chief Volker Turk said Israel, as the occupying power in Gaza, was obliged to ensure sufficient food was provided to the population.\n\n“Children are starving and dying in front of our eyes. Gaza is a dystopian landscape of deadly attacks and total destruction,” he said in a statement.\n\n“The starvation of people in Gaza must end now,” UN refugees chief Filippo Grandi said on X.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organisation warned on Sunday that malnutrition rates were reaching “alarming levels” in the Gaza Strip, marked by a spike in deaths in July.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
