Yet, with no alternative, they are left to endure the worsening conditions.\n\nThe absence of functional streetlights leaves vast portions of the area pitch dark after sunset, making commuting during night hours unsafe.\n\nWhile the monsoon situation has already become unbearable in the rest of the country, what lies ahead for the city during the peak season remains a worrying question.\n\nThe situation is prompting widespread frustration among hundreds of thousands of daily commuters, labourers and factory workers.\n\nSITE was originally established to promote ease of doing business and facilitate industrial growth.\n\nAccording to its official website, SITE Ltd is responsible for the allotment of industrial plots, the development and maintenance of road infrastructure, and the management of storm-water and industrial effluent drainage systems. It is also tasked with collection and disposal of solid waste, supposedly in accordance with local regulations.\n\nHowever, the on-ground realities speak volumes about the body’s inefficiency and failure in streamlining its responsibilities.\n\nEstate Avenue\n\nEstate Avenue, the largest road under SITE Ltd’s jurisdiction — beginning near the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Kemari district and extending to Mauripur Road near PAF Masroor Base — serves as a crucial artery of industrial estate, but now narrates a tale of neglect.\n\nHeaps of garbage and rubble lie scattered across multiple spots on both sides of the road. Particularly on the stretch where the PSO petrol pump is located near the Sher Shah bus stop, stagnant puddles of water and mud are visible almost every 20 seconds of driving.\n\nThough there is little trace left of a pedestrian footpath, walkways are either damaged beyond use or buried under mounds of rubbish and debris. The very concept of cleanliness appears to be missing from the area altogether.\n\nIn almost every road and street, wherever a path ends or there is a culvert, a deep pothole typically follows.\n\nMany of the inner streets branching off from Estate Avenue are also in a dire state — broken and submerged under overflowing sewage water.\n\nCrumbling road, disrupted traffic\n\nThe road descending from Bab-i-Khyber, Metroville, and connecting to Estate Avenue is broken at nearly every point. Piles of garbage line the roadside. The uneven, filthy surface not only slows traffic but poses safety hazards for commuters and motorists alike.\n\nWhether on foot or by vehicle, everyone is forced to navigate through these hazardous, dust-laden roads. The ever-present clouds of dirt mean that white or black clothing is easily soiled after even a short walk.\n\nOne half of Central Avenue — particularly the stretch from SDM Pulya to Ghani Chowrangi — is completely destroyed. It is now submerged in dirty drain water and sludge. The other track is only marginally better, also marred by disrepair and uncleanliness.\n\nThere is no provision for pedestrian walkways here either — footpaths, if they ever existed, have long vanished.\n\nMoin Akhtar Road, starting from Nauras Chowrangi and merging with Estate Avenue at Siemens Chowrangi, is yet another example of neglect.\n\nThere is either no footpath or it remains buried beneath heaps of garbage and filth. No signs of any cleaning activity can be seen here from the regulator.\n\nThe road leading to the SITE Gas Turbine Power Station — which connects to Central Avenue — is also in a state of deterioration. At almost every turn, garbage dumps remain unattended. Patches of stagnant sludge and foul-smelling puddles dot the road, turning it into a hazard zone for workers, commuters, and their vehicles.\n\nNauman Road, which eventually links up with Fakhruddin Valika Road, is in a similarly deplorable condition, along with its adjoining streets. Accumulated sewage water within the lanes has made passage extremely difficult.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, SITE Limited spokesperson Kamran Usman said that funds are allocated in SITE Limited’s annual budget for the cleaning of drains, road repairs and overall infrastructure improvement.\n\nHe said that funds had been allocated in the budget for financial year 2025-26 and work on road repairs and the cleaning of drains will commence shortly.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
