Authorities have launched an investigation to determine the complete details of the incident.\n\n“This appears to be a result of longstanding personal enmity,” said AC Khan, adding that further inquiries are underway.\n\nLast month, two people, including a woman, were killed and 11 others injured after unidentified men opened fire at a group of people returning from a funeral in Chashma Ganda area of Gumbat in KP’s Kohat district, an attack that police said was motivated by personal enmity.\n\nIn February this year, five people were murdered during a shooting in Peshawar’s Badaber area in what police described as personal enmity as the motive.",
