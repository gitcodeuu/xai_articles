  "content": "TURNBERRY: US President Donald Trump said Israel would have to make a decision on next steps in Gaza, adding that he did not know what would happen after the collapse of ceasefire and prisoner-release negotiations with Hamas.\n\nTrump underscored the importance of securing the release of prisoners held by Hamas in Gaza, saying they had suddenly “hardened” up on the issue, and said the US would provide more aid to the war-torn Palestinian enclave.\n\n“They don’t want to give them back, and so Israel is going to have to make a decision,” Trump told reporters at the start of a meeting with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at his golf property in Turnberry, Scotland.\n\n“I know what I’d do, but I don’t think it’s appropriate that I say it. But Israel is going to have to make a decision,” he said, while also claiming without evidence that Hamas members were stealing food coming into Gaza and selling it.\n\nTrump said on Sunday the US would provide more humanitarian aid to Gaza, where concerns are mounting about the worsening hunger, but wanted other countries to participate as well.\n\nStarmer to recall cabinet for decision on recognising Palestinian state\n\nHe said he would discuss the issue with von der Leyen.\n\n“We’re giving a lot of money, a lot of food, a lot of everything,” he said. “If we weren’t there, I\n\nthink people would have starved, frankly. They would have starved, and it’s not like they’re eating well.”\n\nHe said he had spoken with Netanyahu and discussed a number of issues, including Iran. He said and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer would also discuss Israel when they meet at Trump’s golf property in Turnberry on Monday.\n\nTrump also noted said the United States was not acknowledged for earlier food aid for Gaza.\n\nUK cabinet recall\n\nMeanwhile, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to recall his cabinet from their summer break to discuss the situation in Gaza, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, amid growing pressure on the Labour government to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nThe paper said the move to recall his cabinet of ministers next week was set out on Sunday by Downing Street.\n\nThe UK parliament and cabinet are currently in a summer recess until September 1.\n\nThe recall comes after Starmer said on Friday the British government would recognise a Palestinian state only as part of a negotiated peace deal, disappointing many in his Labour Party who want him to follow France in taking swifter action.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said on Thursday France would recognise a Palestinian state, a plan that drew strong condemnation from Israel and the United States, after similar moves from Spain, Norway and Ireland last year.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
