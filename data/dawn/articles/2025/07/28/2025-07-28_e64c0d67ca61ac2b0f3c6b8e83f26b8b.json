  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Kissan Ittehad (PKI) has warned of imminent collapse of farming sector due to years of neglect and mismanagement and criticised the agricultural policies of the current government\n\nDuring a press conference at the Multan Press Club on Sunday, PKI President Khalid Mahmood Khokhar painted a bleak picture of the current state of agriculture, claiming that farmers across the country were facing unprecedented financial distress.\n\n“Agriculture in Pakistan is 100pc devastated. Farmers have no capital left to cultivate the next crop, and for the past two years, they have not been paid fair prices for their produce.”\n\nMr Khokhar highlighted the severe losses suffered by wheat growers, estimating that they had collectively lost Rs2,200bn over the past two years due to low prices and high production costs.\n\n“The situation is equally dire for other crops, with cotton production halved compared to previous years. Cotton plants are struggling to grow beyond one-and-a-half feet, which shows how badly the sector has been neglected,” he added.\n\nSeeks army chief’s intervention to save the sector\n\nThe PKI chief also pointed to a sharp decline in agricultural exports, with rice shipments down by 11pc, corn by 70pc, and mangoes by 40pc. “The money that should have come into Pakistan from these exports has not materialised, and farmers are bearing the brunt.”\n\nKhokhar reserved his harshest criticism for the government, accusing it of indifference towards farmers while benefiting the elite.\n\n“The poor cannot afford two meals a day, yet rulers are increasing their own salaries by 600 per cent,” he said.\n\n“Farmers are being charged exorbitant electricity rates of 40 to 50 rupees per unit, while the government celebrates minor reductions in flour prices as if it has done farmers a great favour.”\n\nThe farmer leader dismissed recent government relief packages as insufficient, demanding instead a guaranteed 25pc profit margin on crops, reduced electricity tariffs, and fair prices for vegetables and other staples.\n\n“We do not need temporary packages; we need systemic reforms that ensure farmers receive the actual cost of production plus a reasonable profit.”\n\nHe called on the military leadership to intervene, stating, “Our rulers have failed to protect agriculture. I appeal to the army chief to step in and save this vital sector before it is too late.”\n\nMr Khokhar warned that without urgent action, Pakistan could face severe food shortages in the coming year, with wheat production alone projected to drop by 10 million tonnes.\n\n“The farmer is economically dead. If agriculture collapses, the entire country will suffer.”\n\nThe PKI leaders called for immediate policy changes and direct negotiations between the government and farmer representatives to avert a full-blown crisis.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
