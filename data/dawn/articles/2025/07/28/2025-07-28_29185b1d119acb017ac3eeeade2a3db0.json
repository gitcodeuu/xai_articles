Arabia-hosted UN conference on two-state solution kicks off today in New York\n\nThe three-day conference, co-chaired by France and Saudi Arabia, is being held at the UN headquarters in New York and has drawn participation from 123 countries and international organisations. It aims to chart a concrete path towards the two-state solution through proposals developed by eight working groups, which have held extensive consultations with UN member states and civil society groups.\n\nThe conference is receiving global attention following French President Emmanuel Macron’s announcement this week that France will formally recognise the State of Palestine—making it the first G7 country to do so.\n\nWhile Macron said the recognition will be formalised at the UN General Assembly in September, Washington strongly condemned France’s decision. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, in a post on X, called the move a “reckless decision,” claiming it “only serves Hamas propaganda and sets back peace”.\n\nThe US, under President Donald Trump, has announced that it will not attend the conference. Israel is also boycotting the event.\n\nA diplomatic cable, reportedly shared with multiple capitals and seen by Reuters in Paris and Washington, revealed that the US had warned governments against participating in the conference, arguing that it could derail ongoing efforts to secure the release of Israeli prisoners and end the war in Gaza.\n\nDespite the US objections, several European countries have signalled their intent to follow France’s lead. In May, fellow EU members Norway, Ireland, and Spain announced that they had begun the process of recognising a Palestinian state.\n\nCurrently, at least 142 of the 193 UN member states either recognise or have indicated plans to recognise Palestine. However, several influential Western countries—including the US, the UK, and Germany — have yet to do so.\n\nPakistan’s participation in the conference aligns with its longstanding support for the two-state solution. Islamabad had earlier voted in favour of a UN General Assembly resolution last year calling for an international summit on the issue in June 2025. That summit could not take place last month.\n\nAs president of the UN Security Council for July 2025, Pakistan chaired the July 24 open debate on the Palestine issue. “Pakistan’s position is absolutely clear — we are firmly on the right side of history and remain steadfast in our support,” Dar stated.\n\nIn the interview, Dar reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to diplomacy: “The solution to conflicts does not lie in kinetic actions — wars and violence. The real path forward is through dialogue and diplomacy, and we are firm believers in this approach.”\n\nFrance has said the goal of the New York meeting is to move beyond rhetoric and offer “concrete measures” to revive the stalled peace process. Organisers hope the momentum from this conference will lead to broader international consensus in favour of Palestinian statehood.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
