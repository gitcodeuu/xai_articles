  "content": "RABAT: FIFA inaugurated on Saturday a regional office in Morocco — the first in North Africa and fifth in the continent — as the kingdom ramps up preparations for the 2030 World Cup which it will host jointly with Spain and Portugal.\n\n“This is a day that will be written in golden letters in the magnificent history of FIFA, African football, Moroccan football, and world football,” said FIFA president Gianni Infantino at the inauguration ceremony.\n\nThe inauguration, also attended by the head of the African Football Confederation, Patrice Motsepe, took place hours before the 2025 Women’s Africa Cup of Nations final — in which Nigeria edged hosts Morocco 3-2 — in Rabat.\n\nMorocco will be the second African nation to host the World Cup in 2030, following South Africa’s edition in 2010. This follows five unsuccessful bids by the kingdom.\n\nFIFA’s other African offices are located in Senegal, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda and South Africa.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
