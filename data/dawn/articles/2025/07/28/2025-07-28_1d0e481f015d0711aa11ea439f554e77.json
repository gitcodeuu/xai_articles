The priest added that seven other bodies had been discovered in the town.\n\nLikewise attributing the attack to “ADF rebels”, Christophe Munyanderu, coordinator of the local NGO Convention for the Respect of Human Rights, gave a provisional death toll of 38.\n\nArmy spokesman in Ituri, Lt Jules Ngongo, did not comment on the toll but confirmed the attack to AFP, stating that “the enemy is believed to have been identified among ADF” fighters. The bloodshed comes after months of calm in the region of Ituri, bordering Uganda.\n\nThe last major attack by the ADF was in February, leaving 23 dead in Mambasa territory.\n\nThe town of Komanda in Irumu territory is a commercial hub linking three other provinces —Tshopo, North Kivu, and Maniema.\n\nThe ADF has killed thousands of civilians and ramped up looting and killing in northeastern DRC despite the deployment both of the Ugandan army alongside Congolese armed forces in the area.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
