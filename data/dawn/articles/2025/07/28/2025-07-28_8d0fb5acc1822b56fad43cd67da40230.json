  "content": "PORT ASHDOD: Israeli forces seized the pro-Palestinian activist boat Handala in the international waters off Gaza and detained the crew and campaigners from 10 countries, including two French parliamentarians, before bringing the vessel into the port of Ashdod on Sunday.\n\nCampaigners from the Freedom Flotilla Coalition had attempted to break the suffocating siege on Gaza, but were abducted by Israeli forces. On board were activists from 10 countries, including two French MPs from the left-wing France Unbowed party, Emma Fourreau and Gabrielle Cathala.\n\nThere are also American, European and Arab activists among those detained by Israeli forces.\n\nA previous boat sent by Freedom Flotilla, the Madleen, was also intercepted by the Israeli military in international waters on June 9 and towed to Ashdod. It carried 12 campaigners, including prominent Swedish activist Greta Thunberg. The activists were later expelled by Israel.\n\nActivists from 10 countries, including two French lawmakers, detained\n\nAdalah, a legal rights centre, said its lawyers were in Ashdod and had been allowed to speak to 19 members of the 21-strong international crew, which included two French parliamentarians and two Al Jazeera journalists. The remaining two of those detained were dual US and Israeli citizens and had been transferred to police custody, Adalah said.\n\n“After 12 hours at sea, following the unlawful interception of the Handala, Israeli authorities confirmed the vessel’s arrival at Ashdod port,” said the group, set up to campaign for the rights of Israel’s Arab population.\n\n“Adalah reiterates that the activists aboard the Handala were part of a peaceful civilian mission to break through Israel’s illegal blockade on Gaza.\n\nThe vessel was intercepted in international waters and their detention constitutes a clear violation of international law.“\n\nJust before midnight local time on Saturday, video streamed live from the Handala showed Israeli troops boarding the vessel. An online tracker showed the ship in international waters west of Gaza.\n\nThe ship had been on course to try to break an Israeli naval blockade of Gaza and bring a small quantity of humanitarian aid to Palestinians.\n\nThe Handala’s crew had said before their capture in a post on X that they would go on a hunger strike if the Israeli army intercepted the boat and detained its passengers.\n\nThe Israeli foreign ministry said the navy stopped the Handala to prevent it from entering the coastal waters off the territory of Gaza. “The vessel is safely making its way to the shores of Israel. All passengers are safe,” it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
