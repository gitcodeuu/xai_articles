  "content": "PARIS: Tadej Pogacar claimed his fourth Tour de France title on Sunday, cementing his status as the most dominant rider of his generation and joining Britain’s Chris Froome on the all-time winners’ list.\n\nThe 26-year-old Slov­enian, who previously triumphed in 2020, 2021 and 2024, delivered a near-flawless performance over three weeks, excelling in every department, even coming close to prevailing on a spectacular final stage on the Champs Elysees after an epic duel with Belgian Wout van Aert.\n\nPogacar attacked relentlessly in the ascents of the Butte Montmartre but eventually suffered a brutal counterpunch from Van Aert, who went solo to win the 21st stage.\n\nThe competitive element was largely neutralised on Sunday after orga­n­isers decided to freeze the times with about 50 kilometres left in the stage due to hazardous road conditions in driving rain.\n\nIt did not prevent Pogacar from going for it, but Van Aert proved to be the best on the day, beating Italian Davide Ballerini and third-placed Matej Mohoric. Pogacar took fourth place.\n\nThe world champion effectively sealed his victory in the Pyrenees, with a brutal attack on the climb to Hautacam and a commanding victory in the uphill individual time trial, leaving chief rival Jonas Vingegaard more than four minutes behind before controlling the race.\n\nGerman Florian Lipowitz finished third on his Tour debut and won the white jersey for the best U-25 rider.\n\nOn Sunday, celebrations turned tense when the final stage featured three climbs up Montm­artre.\n\nWith his latest triumph, Pogacar equals Froome (2013, 201517) and now only trails cycling greats Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain, who share the record with five titles.\n\nPogacar also secured the polka-dot jersey for the mountains classification, underlining his all-round dominance, while Italy’s Jonathan Milan clinched the green jersey for the points competition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
