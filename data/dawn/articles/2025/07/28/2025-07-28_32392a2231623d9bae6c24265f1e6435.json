  "content": "The German Consulate General in Karachi on Monday announced on social media that it will be closed for services to non-EU citizens “until further notice”.\n\nAccording to the announcement, all services for non-EU citizens have been suspended, including visa appointments.\n\n“All confirmed visa appointments for non-EU citizens for an undisclosed time are cancelled and will not be rescheduled,” the notice read. “Applicants will need to register again via our appointment system.”\n\nA similar notice has been published on the consulate’s website.\n\nThe German Embassy in Islamabad has not issued a similar notice. Dawn.com has reached out to the embassy for comment.\n\nLast month, United States consulates in Karachi and Lahore requested that all applicants for F, M or J nonimmigrant visas make their social media accounts public for vetting, after similar instructions were issued by the US Embassy in New Delhi.",
