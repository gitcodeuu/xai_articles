So far, the initiative has provided free legal aid to over 7,000 litigants across Pakistan, a source told Dawn.\n\nThe committees were constituted by the LJCP to help those unable to pursue cases in courts due to financial constraints.\n\nThe commission’s secretariat supports these committees through the Access to Justice Development Fund (AJDF), which covers the costs of lawyers, court fees, copying charges, process fees and any other expenses.\n\nThese DLECs are functioning in 132 districts across Pakistan, including the ex-Fata region.\n\nTo apply for funding, deserving litigants submit a request on plain paper to the district and sessions judge with a copy of their identification document.\n\nThe litigants are provided funds to pursue criminal, civil and family matters. The funds are given to lawyers in two instalments: at the time of assigning the case and the final instalment after the case is decided.\n\nAccording to the breakdown of Rs114.8m disbursed under the initiative, Rs33.8m was released to 36 DLECs in Punjab, Rs20.8m to 27 committees in Sindh, Rs31.6m to 35 committees in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Rs25.8m to 32 committees in Balochistan and Rs2.8m to two committees in Islamabad.\n\nUnder the programme, the district jail superintendent can also forward applications of under-trial or convicted prisoners or any inmate if they need assistance to pursue their cases.\n\nThe committee can also consider cases referred by any court for legal aid to those with pending cases.\n\n‘Blessing’ for litigants\n\nThe financial assistance available for each litigant has also been enhanced from Rs40,000 to Rs50,000.\n\nAppreciating the initiative, Supreme Court Bar Association President Mian Muhammad Rauf Atta said the programme will prove to be a “blessing”, especially to inmates whose cases remained pending for years only because they could not afford a lawyer to represent them in courts.\n\nNow, their cases will be heard on time, Mr Atta said. He added sometimes, the litigants’ inability to hire an experienced counsel due to financial issues complicates their cases.\n\nThis issue has also been rectified through the initiative since DLECs will select lawyers from a list provided by the district and sessions judges concerned or by the superior judiciary.\n\nWhen asked whether Rs50,000 were enough for litigants to pursue cases, Mr Atta said the initiative was a start and the funding might get enhanced in future.\n\nThe DLECs, presided over by the district and sessions judge, comprised the district co-ordination officer/deputy commissioner/political agent, superintendent, district jail, district bar association president and a civil society representative as members.\n\nAs per the directions of AJDF, banners and posters are displayed in court premises, bar rooms, offices of the deputy commissioners and district revenue officers and district jails to inform litigants and under-trial prisoners about the facility.\n\nThe internal audit of the fund is conducted annually in accordance with relevant laws of provincial governments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
