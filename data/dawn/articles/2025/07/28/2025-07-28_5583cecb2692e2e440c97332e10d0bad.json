The cause of the crash was under investigation, the police said.\n\nA picture by German news agency DPA showed carriages largely intact but jackknifed into each other and rolled onto their sides.\n\nGerman national rail operator Deutsche Bahn said there were “many injured” and its thoughts were with the victims and their loved ones. It was not clear what had caused the train to derail, it said, adding that it would support the authorities in their investigation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
