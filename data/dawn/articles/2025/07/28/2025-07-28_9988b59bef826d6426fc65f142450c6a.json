No restoration work has been initiated, they lamented and gave a one-day ultimatum to the government for action or they would launch protests.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of Kondus and Haldi in Ghanche district also complained about a lack of relief supplies, electricity, drinking water and road access.\n\nA devastating landslide in Kondus swept away over 50 homes, leaving scores of families homeless and in urgent need of food, shelter, medical care and emergency services. Locals also lamented the unavailability of the internet, making it even harder to communicate or call for help.\n\nIn the Shigar district, flash floods hit the Tisar and Garchahma areas. Resident Sajid Ali said electricity had been out for the last three to four days and that many families had evacuated their homes in search of safer ground. Drinking water was also unavailable, he added.\n\nPeople in Jutal and other flood-affected regions of Gilgit-Baltistan also complained about the lack of basic facilities and criticised the government for its slow response and failure to deliver timely relief.\n\n‘15 tourists swept away’\n\nMeanwhile, a private TV anchor, her husband and their four children are also among the tourists reported missing in Babusar Valley, it emerged on Sunday.\n\nGilgit-Baltistan government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said that the family of an anchorperson for a Pashto-language TV channel had contacted authorities, reporting that she, her husband and their four children had gone missing during the recent flash floods.\n\nMr Faraq said they had recovered a wallet belonging to the anchorperson, adding that the body of an unidentified woman was recovered from the Indus River in Chilas’s Minar area. The woman is believed to be among the tourists who were swept away by flash floods on Babusar Highway.\n\nHe said that according to eyewitness accounts, between 10 and 15 tourists were swept away by floodwaters on the Babusar Highway. So far, seven bodies have been recovered.\n\n“The search for the remaining missing persons is ongoing with the help of sniffer dogs and drones and personnel from Diamer Police, Rescue 1122, the Pakistan Army and GB Scouts are participating in the operation,” he said, adding that the effort would continue until all missing individuals are located.\n\nHe said additional rescue operations were also underway in Ghanche, Ghizer and Gilgit. Human remains were also recovered during a search operation in the Thak Bhasha area of Diamer, and DNA testing will be required for identification.\n\nFederal Secretary for Commun­ications and Works Sher Alam Masood visited the Babusar Highway site in Chilas alongside local officials to assess the damage.\n\nHe told the media that restoration efforts using heavy machinery were ongoing, with the road blocked in 15 locations and partial clearance achi­eved at 13 of them. He hoped that the highway would be partially reopened for traffic by Monday (today).\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 28th, 2025",
