  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Supreme Court on Monday extended its video link facility to benefit lawyers and litigants residing in far-flung regions of the country.\n\nThe facility has been established at the Sindh High Court’s division bench in Sukkur, as well as at four benches of the Peshawar High Court in Abbottabad, Mingora, Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan.\n\nThe facility significantly reduces the need for long-distance travel by enabling lawyers and litigants from these remote areas to appear before the Supreme Court via video link, thereby saving both time and resources.\n\nThis development forms a key part of the Supreme Court’s broader vision to adopt a public-centric approach by integrating information technology, aiming to make the justice system more responsive, transparent, and efficient.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 1st, 2025",
