  "content": "WASHINGTON: The United States has decided to lift all sanctions against Syria to allow an end to the country’s isolation from the international financial system and President Donald Trump is set to sign an executive order as soon as Tuesday terminating the sanctions regime in line with his pledge to help Syria rebuild after a devastating civil war.\n\nBut the US will maintain sanctions on Syria’s ousted former president Bashar Al Assad, his associates, human rights abusers, drug traffickers, people linked to chemical weapons activities, the militant Islamic State group and its affiliates, White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told reporters in a briefing on Monday.\n\nAssad was toppled in December in a lightning offensive by anti-government fighters, and Syria has since taken steps to re-establish international ties, but the country remains unstable.\n\nPresident Ahmed Al Sharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.\n\nSome in Congress are pushing for the measures to be totally repealed, while Europe has announced the end of its economic sanctions regime.\n\n“He’s committed to supporting a Syria that is stable, unified and at peace with itself and its neighbours,” Leavitt said. “This is another promise made and promise kept by this president to promote peace and stability in the region.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 1st, 2025",
