  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Despite having a court order in his favour, Dr Ziaul Qayyum, who was terminated from the position of the executive director (ED) of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) in May, was not allowed to resume his duties on Monday.\n\nOn June 28, Civil Court Judge Salman Badar had suspended the HEC office order issued on May 21, terminating Dr Qayyum’s contract and directed the HEC management to reinstate him. The court has fixed July 16 as the next date of hearing of the petition that had been filed by Dr Qayyum against the HEC after his removal from the post.\n\nAccording to sources, when Dr Qayyum came to the HEC offices for resuming the charge, he was not allowed to enter the premises. Dr Qayyum alleged that he was also manhandled by the guards posted at the main entrance.\n\nAfter having brief arguments with the staff, Dr Qayyum left the premises and later wrote an email to the HEC chairman, apprising him of the court’s order and asking him to allow him resume his duties in compliance with the court’s order.\n\nAccording to the sources, HEC Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed also responded to Dr Qayyum’s email, stating that he firmly believed in the supremacy of law and held great respect for the courts. Dr Mukhtar also informed Dr Qayyum that he would make future decision after consulting his legal adviser and assured him that he would adhere to the court’s orders in letter and spirit.\n\nWhen contacted, the HEC chairman denied that Dr Qayyum was manhandled, and made a counter allegation that it was the former ED’s driver who had actually manhandled the security guards. The HEC chairman said that Dr Qayyum’s services had been terminated through a unanimous decision of the HEC commission, and not by any individual.\n\n“Our legal team will look into this order and we will move forward after getting legal opinion. We will also get input of the commission on this order,” he said.\n\nThe HEC governing body had removed Dr Qayyum from position of the ED over “poor performance”, two years before completion of his four-year tenure. The announcement was made through a brief statement, which said the decision was taken by the Commission upon the recommendation of the Performance Evaluation Committee.\n\nFor the interim period, Adviser (Planning & Development) Dr Mazhar Saeed has been assigned the charge of the office,“ read the statement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 1st, 2025",
