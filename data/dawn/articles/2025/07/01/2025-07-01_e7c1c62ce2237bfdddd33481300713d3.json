How is the company that has been terminated and disqualified by the NHA being given a tender again? This is a case of ghost tendering.”\n\nThe meeting was attended by Senators Haji Hidayatullah Khan, Syed Waqar Mehdi, Falak Naz, Kamran Murtaza, and Kamil Ali Agha.\n\nSeveral construction firms have already contested the contract awards for the four sections of the CAREC Tranche-III project, bringing their grievances before the Grievance Redressal Cell (GRC) of the NHA and the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA).\n\nThe complainants had questioned the financial stren­gth of NXCC and its eligibility under NHA criteria.\n\nAccording to documents reviewed by Dawn, NXCC was disqualified by the NHA in 2023 for failing to complete the 62km Lodhran-Multan section but was still allowed to submit bids for the CAREC project.\n\nThe NHA claimed the firm had been cleared by the court, but Senator Abro questioned why the NHA had not appealed the decision. “You wasted the time to facilitate the firm,” he said.\n\nSenator Kamran Murtaza asked why the NHA was fav­ouring a firm disqualified twice and whether NXCC had provided an affidavit stating it was not facing litigation.\n\nNHA officials said no such affidavit was submitted, but Mr Abro presented an affidavit from the firm claiming otherwise. “You [NHA] are befooling the government as the firm had submitted a false statement,” Mr Abro said.\n\nSenator Kamil Ali Agha demanded the firm be blacklisted for life.\n\n“Suspend this project immediately, we will not allow you [NHA] to commit such a heinous irregularity,” Mr Abro said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) ruled that the appeal against the NHA’s decision was maintainable and directed the NHA not to finalise the procurement process until the appeal was resolved.\n\nThe CAREC Tranche-III project involves four lots for which 20 firms submitted bids.\n\nAfter technical evaluation, five firms each qualified for Lots 1 and 2, four for Lot-3, and two for Lot-4. The total PC-I cost is estimated at Rs85.44bn.\n\nThe project aims to convert a two-lane highway into a four-lane highway.\n\n“The Federal Minister for Economic Affairs has the responsibility to take action against corruption worth billions of rupees,” Mr Abro said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 1st, 2025",
