  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday granted post-arrest bail to PTI social media activist Sanam Javed in a case registered by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and ordered her release.\n\nJustice Farooq Haider heard the activist’s bail plea and accepted it, directing her to submit surety bonds worth Rs500,000.\n\nSanam Javed had filed the petition seeking release on bail, stating that the FIA had registered a baseless case against her. The petition further contended that an additional district and sessions judge wrongly rejected her bail plea, ignoring the actual facts of the case.\n\nThe petition asked the LHC to release the petitioner on bail.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 1st, 2025",
