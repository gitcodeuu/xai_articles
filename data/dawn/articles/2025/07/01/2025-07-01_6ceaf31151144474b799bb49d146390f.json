  "content": "ISLAMABAD: An additional attorney general (AAG) informed the Islamabad High Court on Monday that the federal government will not file an amicus brief in the case of Dr Aafia Siddiqui.\n\nHowever, Justice Sardar Ejaz Ishaq Khan of the IHC sought a detailed explanation from the government regarding its decision.\n\nThe judge, while hearing a petition filed by Dr Fawzia Siddiqui concerning her sister’s health, repatriation and legal assistance, questioned the rationale behind the government’s refusal to participate in the US court proceedings.\n\nAAG Rashid Hafeez, appearing before the bench, said the government had decided not to file the amicus brief. Justice Khan, however, expressed concern over the lack of reasoning behind such a critical decision.\n\n“When the government or the attorney general makes a decision, it must be based on reasons. This is a constitutional court — it is not acceptable that a decision is simply announced without explanation,” remarked Justice Khan.\n\nHe observed that the judiciary requires transparency and accountability in governmental actions, particularly in cases involving fundamental rights and foreign legal proceedings.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 1st, 2025",
