On March 18, the first phase of nine old power plants was put up for auction through open bidding. Only seven plants received qualified bids amounting Rs9.05bn against a reserve price of Rs8.07bn.\n\nHowever, no international bidder participated in the bidding process. As per the contract requirements, the bid money was must to be paid either 100pc in advance or through four installments within three months.\n\nAmong the seven awarded plants, six contracts were bagged by M/S Daraza Builders while the contract for the 20MW Multan Cantt plant was awarded to M/S Malik Bashir Traders.\n\nAt the 147MW Kotri Power Plant, Genco-I or JPCL signed a contract worth Rs1.88bn with M/S Daraza, which deposited the required 10pc performance guarantee but no further payment has been received to date. Surprisingly, Genco-1 top management did not issue any delay notices or invoke interest penalties — despite clear contractual clauses.\n\nGenco-II (CPGCL) returned a bid security of over Rs96m to M/S Daraza for the 50MW Sukkur Plant without contract finalisation.\n\nAt the 57.2 MW Quetta Power Plant, a second-phase bid of Rs601m was submitted by Perfect Tel Company. Payment delays continue, allegedly with the tacit support of Genco-II (CPGCL) and GHCL top brass.\n\nProcedural lapses have also been reported in Genco-III (NPGCL) whose management is internally under scrutiny for delaying contracts of key plants. For example, contract for TPS Multan Cantt plant (20MW) was signed in June 2025 with M/S Malik Bashir Traders — three months after the auction, raising concerns over NPGCL’s intent.\n\nContracts for NGPS Multan (260MW) and GTPS Shahdara (85MW), both awarded to M/S Daraza, are only now being signed — with delays of over 3.5 months. Contract for GTPS Faisalabad (247 MW) remains unsigned amid speculations of interest-based gains.\n\nMeanwhile, LPGCL (Genco-IV) signed a Rs2.133bn contract with M/S Daraza for the Lakhra Power Plant in May 2025. Although the first installment was paid, the second was delayed by 18 days.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 14th, 2025",
