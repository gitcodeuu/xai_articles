  "content": "Bananas are the world’s most consumed fruit and the fourth most important food crop globally, following wheat, rice, and maize. More than 400 million people across the globe depend on bananas for 15–27 per cent of their daily caloric intake. Yet, this vital food source is increasingly at risk. A recent report by Christian Aid, a UK-based humanitarian organisation, has warned that the banana crop faces mounting threats from climate change, endangering both local livelihoods and global food security.\n\nIn banana-growing regions like Guatemala, the impacts of climate change are already visible. Banana growers there are witnessing firsthand how erratic weather patterns and rising temperatures are devastating their once-resilient banana plantations. Aurelia, a smallholder farmer in Guatemala, shared with Christian Aid: “The banana crops are dying off. The trees are folding down and dying. In the past, it was predicted that this would happen in the future, but it has come earlier… What’s uncertain is whether this situation will worsen and lead to the loss of entire plantations.”\n\nThe situation is alarming, not just for Guatemala but for all banana-exporting countries, including Colombia, Costa Rica, Brazil, and India. These countries are forecasted to experience significant yield declines by 2050, with a potential 60pc reduction in land suitable for banana cultivation by 2080. A large share of bananas grown for export belong to a single variety, Cavendish, which while high-yielding is genetically uniform and highly vulnerable to both disease and climate extremes.\n\nPakistan, though not a major global banana exporter, is a significant producer at the regional level, particularly in Sindh and Balochistan. The coastal and southern regions of Sindh, including Thatta, Badin, Tando Allahyar, Matyari, Shaheed Benazirabad, Muhammad Khan, and Khairpur, are traditional banana-growing areas. However, just like other parts of the world, Pakistan’s banana sector, especially Lasbela Balochistan, is under increasing threat due to rising temperatures, erratic rainfall, water shortages, floods, and soil degradation.\n\nIf current climate trends continue, Pakistan’s banana production could face severe declines, threatening food security, farmer livelihoods, and regional fruit markets\n\nIn recent years, extreme weather events — heatwaves, unseasonal rains, and prolonged dry spells — have led to severe crop damage. This has not only affected yields but has also led to increased pest and fungal attacks on banana plants. Farmers in Pakistan are reporting higher input costs, especially for water, fertilisers, and disease management, putting further strain on already vulnerable smallholders.\n\nGlobally and locally, fungal diseases are becoming a major concern. One such disease, Black Leaf Streak (also known as Black Sigatoka), can reduce the photosynthetic capability of banana plants by up to 80pc, severely affecting their productivity. This fungus thrives in wet and humid conditions that are becoming more common due to climate-induced weather patterns in Pakistan.\n\nEven more dangerous is Panama disease, particularly the Tropical Race 4 variant. This soil-borne disease is devastating because once it infects a field, banana cultivation becomes nearly impossible. The Cavendish variety, prevalent in many Pakistani farms due to its commercial appeal, is especially susceptible to this disease. Sindh is the leading banana growing area of Pakistan growing about 90pc of the country’s supply. The banana growers are worried regarding this situation.\n\nIf current trends continue, Pakistan’s banana production could face severe declines, threatening food security, farmer livelihoods, and regional fruit markets. Already, banana yields have fluctuated in recent years due to a combination of climate stress, disease outbreaks, and poor farm practices. The lack of investment in climate-resilient agriculture, especially for fruit crops, adds to the challenge.\n\nThere is also an over-reliance on few commercial banana varieties which further narrows the genetic diversity and increases susceptibility to climate shocks. Unlike rice or wheat, banana farming has not been a major focus in Pakistan’s climate adaptation strategies. This must change.\n\nTo protect banana growers in Pakistan and elsewhere, immediate and coordinated action is required at multiple levels. Efforts should be made to invest in research and development of climate-resilient and disease-tolerant banana strains that are better suited for changing conditions in Sindh and other areas.\n\nFarmer education about the impacts of climate change and how to adopt adaptive agricultural techniques, particularly in banana-growing regions is also crucial, as is promoting integrated pest and disease management, organic mulching, water-saving irrigation methods like drip systems, and early-warning systems for extreme weather.\n\nFurthermore, investments must also be made to enhance cold storage, transport, and market access to reduce post-harvest losses, which are becoming worse due to heatwaves and storage failures. These efforts should be policy-driven with Pakistan’s National Climate Change Policy and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement explicitly including fruit crops like bananas in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies.\n\nMoreover, since the case of the bad bananas is becoming a global phenomenon, sharing knowledge and disease monitoring with other banana-producing nations, especially India, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh, through South-South cooperation is vital.\n\nOrganisations like Christian Aid are calling for stronger global commitment to climate action. As part of the Paris Agreement, every country — including Pakistan — must revise and implement its NDCs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote climate-resilient agriculture. Failure to act will risk the collapse of banana production, with far-reaching consequences for nutrition, employment, and income security.\n\nIt’s not just about a fruit; it’s about an entire ecosystem — of farmers, consumers, trade networks, and national economies. Bananas, for millions of people in the Global South, are not a luxury — they are a daily staple and a source of income. Climate change is turning this food security pillar into a fragile commodity. Pakistan must not wait until its banana fields fall silent.\n\nDr Muhammad Ismail Kumbhar is professor at the Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam, and Aslam Memon Director of PARC-SSRI, Tandojam\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, July 14th, 2025",
