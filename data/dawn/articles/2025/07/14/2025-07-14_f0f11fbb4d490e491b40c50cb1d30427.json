They fought a brief but brutal border war in 1962, and talks over the decades to settle the border dispute have made slow progress.\n\nLast month, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart that the two countries should seek a “permanent solution” to the border dispute, seen as a new push by New Delhi for a conclusive outcome.\n\n“It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,” Jaishankar said, adding that it was also critical that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks be avoided to foster mutually beneficial cooperation.\n\nThe minister was speaking against the backdrop of Beijing’s restrictions in recent months on supplies of critical minerals such as rare earth magnets and machinery for the manufacturing of high-tech goods.\n\nIndia holds the world’s fifth-largest rare earth reserves, but its domestic output remains underdeveloped.\n\nThere was no immediate Chinese readout of the talks between Jaishankar and Wang.\n\nJaishankar, who is in China to attend the meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng earlier in the day, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.\n\nIndia and China should steadily advance practical cooperation and respect each other’s concerns, Han told Jaishankar, Xinhua said.",
