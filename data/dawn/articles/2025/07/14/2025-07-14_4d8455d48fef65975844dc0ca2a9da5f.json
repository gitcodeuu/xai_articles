Mr Chaudhry’s original designation is member for finance, and he is a permanent appointee on that post.\n\nThis means that, effectively, the four-member board is currently operating with one permanent officer and two who have been given ‘additional charge’.\n\nMr Chaudhry also served as the interim Wapda chairman in 2022, after retired Lt-Gen Muzammil Hussain resigned due to “personal reasons”. He then passed the role to Lt-Gen Ghani three months later.\n\nAccording to a former director general of human resources at Wapda, “This is administrative chaos with a huge national cost”. For instance, the authority at present cannot meet even its quorum requirements – a legal necessity for taking any decision.\n\nFor quorum to be complete, the chairman and at least one regular member are required to be present, but these posts are currently held by the same person.\n\nIn such a situation, any decision taken by the board can potentially attract audit objections or legal challenges.\n\nBlame game\n\nDawn made several attempts to contact Muhammad Moeen Wattoo, the incumbent federal minister for water resources, over the course of two weeks.\n\nHowever, both the minister and his spokesperson did not respond to repeated requests for comment on the composition of Wapda’s governing body.\n\nBut insiders told Dawn that the tenure of the two members for water and power expired in November last year.\n\nSources claimed the ministry was also informed of this in advance, and an advertisement to fill both posts was sent to the ministry for approval in October 2024. However, the ministry has not advertised the posts, nor allowed Wapda to do so, they said.\n\nThe outgoing members, meanwhile, were reportedly instructed to remain in their posts. This arrangement continued till March 13, 2025, when they eventually relinquished their posts on verbal instructions from on-high, after the ministry inquired about the expiry of their tenures. After that, the authority gave ‘look after’ charge of the two vacant posts to two senior officers.\n\nWapda sources claimed they kept pressing the ministry for the appointments, but to no avail. It was in the midst of this confusion that the previous chairman abruptly quit on June 20.\n\nFollowing his exit, the ministry handed his responsibilities to the only surviving permanent member (finance) of the authority.\n\nThe ministry, however, shifted the blame for blocked appointments onto the PM’s Office. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from the water resources ministry told Dawn that selection boards were named to hire these officers and sent the PMO, but there had been no response.\n\nThe ministry was subsequently told that the names of the selection board members had been sent for “vetting” and the process is still ongoing.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 14th, 2025",
