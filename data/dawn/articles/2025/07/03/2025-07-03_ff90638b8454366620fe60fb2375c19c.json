In Karachi, over 20,000 officers and personnel have been deployed till Ashura.\n\nMeanwhile, Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi stressed the crucial role of religious scholars in ensuring peace during Muharram.\n\n“It is not enough how much we thank you for your role — the heads and ulema of all sects — in Muharram, as everyone has a role in this,” Naqvi said as he met with scholars from various schools of thought in Islamabad.\n\nMinister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Maulana Abdul Khabeer Azad, chairman of the Central Ruet-i-Hilal Committee, were also present during the meeting.\n\nNaqvi highlighted that the efforts of law enforcement agencies during Muharram were as important as those of religious scholars, according to a post on X by the interior ministry.\n\nDuring the meeting, Naqvi noted that ulema remained in “constant communication” with the administration during Muharram and “solved minor disputes”.\n\nHe requested Maulana Azad, as well as other scholars, to collectively offer Zuhr prayers at Islamabad’s Faisal Mosque on August 14. “This will give a message to the whole world that we are all united, and there is no better day than the 14th of August.”\n\nChaudhry also credited religious scholars for dealing with terrorism, sectarianism, and maintaining peace during the month of Muharram.\n\nOn his part, Maulana Azad affirmed that they all were united for the country’s security.\n\nSpeaking about the uptick in terrorism in KP, Naqvi called on the ulema to engage with religious scholars in the province, offering his cooperation in the matter.\n\n“This terrorism will only end on the condition that the locals there do not help them,” he said.\n\nThe interior minister’s remarks come just a day after an assistant commissioner and four others were martyred, while policemen were among 17 others injured as an official vehicle was targeted in Bajaur’s Sadiqabad area.\n\nDuring the meeting, Naqvi also highlighted the role of the armed forces in the recent Iran-Israel ceasefire, saying Pakistan should be proud of “convincing world leaders” and of playing its role as a Muslim country.\n\nLast month, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif noted that Iran openly thanked the people of Pakistan, its political parties, military, and political leadership for their role in ensuring the ceasefire between the two countries.\n\nSeparately, the Punjab Police said today they had registered 72 cases and arrested 83 individuals over the past four days for sharing “objectionable” content on social media.\n\nProviding the details of the past 24 hours on X, the police said 20 cases had been filed and 24 had been taken into custody for uploading “objectionable and hateful content” on social media platforms.\n\nIt warned the public that strict action would be taken against those spreading “sectarian, hateful or inflammatory content” on social media.\n\nThe Punjab Home Department also said it reported 932 social media accounts to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) for spreading inciteful content.\n\n“The Home Department’s Cyber Patrolling and Quick Response Cell is functioning 24/7, and is monitoring and taking immediate action against sectarian, inciteful and religious hatred-based content,” the department said on X.\n\nAdditional input from Imran Gabol.",
