  "content": "GUJRANWALA: A youth committed suicide in Wania Wala area after failing to secure bail for his father who had been arrested for alleged electricity theft 25 days ago.\n\nAccording to locals, when Muhammad Boota, a labourer, failed to pay the electricity bill of Rs30,000, the Gujranwala Electric Power Company disconnected the electricity connection of his home. Boota allegedly connected a wire directly to the main power line to operate a fan at his home because of the searing summer heat.\n\nDuring an inspection, a Gepco team discovered the illegal connection and handed him to the police after registering a theft case against him. Boota was subsequently sent to jail.\n\nIn the days following his arrest, Gepco officials allegedly asked Boota’s only son, 20-year old Faraz, to clear the outstanding dues and arrange his father’s bail. The young man, overwhelmed by the financial burden and emotional distress, consumed acid.\n\nRescue 1122 rushed him to the hospital, where he revealed that he had been unable to arrange the bail amount or pay the fine. “My father has been in jail for the past 25 days, and Gepco has been demanding payment from me,” he reportedly told the medics before succumbing to his injuries. Faraz later passed away at the hospital.\n\nSenior District Bar member Rizwan Gul took up Boota’s case and helped secure his release on bail. Boota was able to attend his son’s funeral upon his release.\n\nSpeaking to the media, Advocate Gul expressed concern over the harsh measures taken against those unable to pay minor utility bills. “This is a tragic reflection of the system’s failure to protect the poor and vulnerable. Detaining a father over a small unpaid bill, and pressuring his son who lacked resources, has led to the loss of a young life,” he said.\n\nThe incident has sparked public outrage and raised serious questions on the handling of electricity theft cases and the treatment of economically disadvantaged segments of the society.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
