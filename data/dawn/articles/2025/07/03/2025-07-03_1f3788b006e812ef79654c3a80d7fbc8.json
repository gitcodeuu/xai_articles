However, Diamer Additional Deputy Commissioner Nizamuddin told Dawn.com the climber fell from a height between Camp One and Camp Two. He said the location where she fell would be traced and the recovery operation would begin thereafter.\n\n“The team accompanying the climber had come to the base camp and informed about her death,” the official said.\n\n“There were initial reports that the woman had died due to an oxygen cylinder explosion, but it was later confirmed that she had fallen into a ravine, which was the cause of her death.”\n\nQasim said she was staying in Chilas with her team since June 15 and departed for the base camp with it on June 16. They had reached Bonner Base Camp on June 17, he added.\n\nHe added that the authorities launched an investigation into the incident following the GB government’s direction and all possible assistance was being provided to the victim’s team.\n\nA rescue operation using a helicopter was planned for tomorrow to search for Klara, he added.\n\nIn May, two climbers died on Mount Everest in the March-May climbing season of the world’s highest peak.\n\nLast August, a climber from Skardu, Murad Sadpara, succumbed to his injuries, a day after the Pakistan Army had launched an operation to rescue him from GB’s Broad Peak.",
