We’re working on it and very, very positive about our progress,” Johnson told reporters at the Capitol, according to Politico.\n\nOriginally approved by the House in May, Trump’s sprawling legislation squeezed through the Senate on Tuesday by a solitary vote but had to return to the lower chamber on Wednesday for a rubber stamp of the Senate’s revisions.\n\nThe package honours many of Trump’s campaign promises, boosting military spending, funding a mass migrant deportation drive and committing $4.5 trillion to extend his first-term tax relief.\n\nBut it is expected to pile an extra $3.4tr over a decade onto the country’s fast-growing deficits, while forcing through the largest cuts to the Medicaid health insurance programme since its 1960s launch.\n\nWhile moderates in the House are anxious that the cuts will damage their prospects of re-election, fiscal hawks are chafing over savings that they say fall short of what they were promised by hundreds of billions of dollars.\n\nJohnson has to negotiate incredibly tight margins, and can likely only lose three lawmakers among more than two dozen who have declared themselves open to rejecting Trump’s bill.\n\nRepublican leaders had been hoping to spend just a few hours on Wednesday afternoon green-lighting the package, although they had a cushion of two days before Trump’s self-imposed July 4 deadline.\n\nThe 887-page text only passed in the Senate after a flurry of tweaks that pulled the House-passed text further to the right.\n\nRepublicans lost one conservative who was angry about adding to the country’s $37tr debt burden and two moderates worried about almost $1tr in health care cuts.\n\nSome estimates put the total number of recipients set to lose their health insurance at $17 million, while scores of rural hospitals are expected to close.\n\nLegislation in the House has to go through multiple “test” votes before it can come up for final approval, and a majority must wave it through at each of these stages.\n\nThere were warning signs early in the day as the package stumbled at one of the first steps, with a straightforward vote that ought to have taken minutes remaining open for seven hours and 31 minutes — making it the longest House vote in history.\n\nJohnson had made clear that he was banking on Trump leaning on waverers, as he has in the past to turn around contentious House votes that were headed for failure.\n\nThe president has spent weeks cajoling Republicans torn between angering welfare recipients at home and incurring his wrath.\n\nTrump pressured House Republicans to get the bill over the line in a private White House meeting with several holdouts on Wednesday.\n\n“What are the Republicans waiting for?” he posted on his Truth Social platform just after midnight.\n\n“What are you trying to prove??? MAGA is not happy, and it’s costing you votes!!!”\n\nHouse Democrats have signalled that they plan to campaign on the bill to flip the chamber in the 2026 midterm elections, pointing to analyses showing that it represents a historic redistribution of wealth from the poorest Americans to the richest.\n\n“Shame on Senate Republicans for passing this disgusting abomination,” House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters.",
