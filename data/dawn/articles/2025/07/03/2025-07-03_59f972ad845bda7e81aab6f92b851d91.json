  "content": "Bangladesh, the world’s second-biggest garment manufacturer, aims to strike a trade deal with the United States before President Donald Trump’s punishing tariffs kick in next week, the country’s top commerce official told AFP.\n\nDhaka is proposing to buy Boeing planes and boost imports of US wheat, cotton and oil in a bid to reduce the trade deficit, which Trump used as the reason for imposing painful levies in his “Liberation Day” announcement.\n\n“We have finalised a draft reciprocal trade agreement,” Mahbubur Rahman said on Wednesday, adding the government was “hopeful of reaching a win-win agreement”.\n\nRahman said a meeting between officials from both countries was slated for July 8, with the US representing 20 per cent of Bangladesh’s ready-made garments exports.\n\nTextile and garment production accounts for about 8pc of exports in Bangladesh and the industry has been rebuilding after it was hit hard in a student-led revolution that toppled the government last year.\n\nTrump hit Bangladesh with 37pc tariffs in his April 2 announcement, which is more than double the 16pc already placed on cotton products.\n\nHe suspended the tolls’ introduction until July 9, as he did with other global trading partners, though a baseline 10pc levy was kept in place.\n\nBangladesh exported $8.36 billion worth of goods to the United States in 2024, while imports from there amounted to $2.21bn, according to the Bangladesh Bank and the National Board of Revenue.\n\n“As part of the initiative to reduce the trade gap, the government already decided to import a large volume of wheat, purchasing 14 aircraft from US manufacturer Boeing, buying cotton and more oil and gas from the US farms,” Rahman said.\n\nHe did not give further details on the exact timing or extent of the proposed deals, but said the government had held around 28 meetings and document exchanges in a bid to reach an agreement.\n\nInterim leader Muhammad Yunus spoke to US Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Monday and told him Dhaka was “working with your officials to finalise a package of measures to effectively respond to President Trump’s trade agenda”.\n\nMahmud Hasan Khan, president of the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BGMEA), the national platform of the garment makers, expressed concerns about any deal.\n\n“The already enacted additional 10pc tariff is hitting our exporters, and if it goes further, we might lose US buyers,” he warned.\n\nBut Mohammad Hatem, president of the Bangladesh Knitwear Manufacturers and Exporters Association (BKMEA), told AFP he was optimistic.\n\n“We are hopeful of a positive outcome on the US tariff before July 9,” he said.\n\n“There will be a temporary problem if the US administration does not revise the tariff. But it will largely and ultimately hit the US buyers, as they would have to buy goods at higher prices.”",
