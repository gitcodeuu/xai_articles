Discounts and the introduction of earthquake insurance had “prevented Japan-bound travel from dropping to zero,” he added.\n\nBranden Choi, a 28-year-old Hong Kong resident, said he was a frequent traveller to Japan but was hesitant to visit the country during July and August due to the manga prediction.\n\n“If possible, I might delay my trip and go after September”, he said.\n\nRyo Tatsuki, the artist behind the manga titled The Future I Saw, first published in 1999 and then re-released in 2021, has tried to dampen the speculation, saying in a statement issued by her publisher that she was “not a prophet”.\n\nThe first edition of the manga warned of a major natural disaster in March 2011. That was the month and year when a massive earthquake, tsunami and nuclear disaster struck Japan’s northeastern coast, killing thousands.\n\nSome have interpreted the latest edition as predicting a catastrophic event specifically on July 5, 2025, although Tatsuki has denied this.\n\nSituated within the Pacific Ocean’s ‘Ring of Fire’, Japan is one of the most earthquake-prone countries in the world. In recent days, there have been more than 900 earthquakes, most of them small tremors, on islands off the southern tip of Kyushu.\n\nBut Robert Geller, a professor at the University of Tokyo who has studied seismology since 1971, said even scientifically-based earthquake prediction was “impossible”.\n\n“None of the predictions I’ve experienced in my scientific career have come close at all,” he said.\n\nNevertheless, low-cost carrier Greater Bay Airlines became the latest Hong Kong airline on Wednesday to cancel flights to Japan due to low demand, saying it would indefinitely suspend its service to Tokushima in western Japan from September.\n\nSerena Peng, 30, a visitor to Tokyo from Seattle, had initially tried to talk her husband out of visiting Japan after seeing the social media speculation.\n\n“I’m not super worried right now, but I was before,” she said, speaking outside Tokyo’s bustling Senso-ji temple.\n\nMeanwhile, an earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.5 hit a remote island in southwestern Japan today, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.\n\nThe earthquake’s epicentre was off the coast of the Tokara island chain in Kagoshima prefecture, nearly 1,200 kilometres from Tokyo, the agency said, adding that a tsunami warning had not been issued.\n\nThe quake hit at a depth of 20km, giving it a seismic intensity of ‘6 lower’ on Japan’s 1-7 scale on Akuseki Island, the agency said. Akuseki has a population of 89. The intensity is classified as a level that makes it “difficult to remain standing”, according to the agency.\n\nMore than 1,000 tremors with a seismic intensity of 1 or above on the Japanese scale have been detected around the island chain between June 21 and July 3, the agency said.",
