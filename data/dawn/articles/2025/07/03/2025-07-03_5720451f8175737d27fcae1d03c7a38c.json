There has been a slight increase in the number of deaths in June compared to May, when 14 people died and 1374 were injured in traffic accidents.\n\nA spokesman for the emergency services stated that 1,321 road traffic accidents were reported to Rescue 1122 in the month of June, and a total of 1,506 people were victims of these accidents. In the 1,506 traffic accident victims include 1,273 men and 233 are women.\n\nHe mentioned that the emergency Rescue Service Rawalpindi provided prompt rescue services to all victims. In these road traffic accidents, 16 people were killed, 735 were seriously injured, and 755 were slightly injured. Most of the victims of these accidents are between the ages of 11 and 40.\n\nRescue teams reached all accidents on time, maintaining an average response time, he added. The majority of these accidents involve car and motorcycle riders. Causes cited include speeding, careless driving, wrong turns, tyre blowouts, and other factors, said the spokesman.\n\nRescue Service has also been working to reduce the number of road traffic accidents. However, they emphasised that “Observance of traffic rules is essential to reduce road accidents.”\n\nSome people remarked that obeying traffic rules can only be achieved if traffic police focus on regulating traffic on roads and the implementation of traffic rules, instead of launching campaigns on social media.\n\nOthers believed that it is not just the traffic police, but also the district administration and various government departments responsible for maintaining roads and streets, which appear to lack interest in doing so.They suggested that if these institutions took more interest, road deaths could be better controlled.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
