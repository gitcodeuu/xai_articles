  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh High Court (SHC) on Wednesday issued notices to the transport department, commissioner and others on a petition filed against a ban on the operation of rickshaws on various major thoroughfares of the city.\n\nA two-judge bench of the SHC comprising Justice Zulfiqar Ali Sangi and Justice Nisar Ahmed Bhanbhro also put the provincial law officer on notice.\n\nIt directed the respondents, as well as the advocate general, to file comments till July 16.\n\nCiting the chief secretary, secretary of the transport & mass transit department, Karachi commissioner, additional inspector general of police, Karachi, DIG traffic and others as respondents, the All Karachi Qingqi Rickshaw Association has petitioned the SHC, impugning an order/notification of the commissioner Karachi passed on April 15, imposing a complete ban on all types of rickshaws from plying on 11 major roads of the provincial metropolis.\n\nSHC issues notices to commissioner, DIG traffic and others for 16th\n\nThe counsel for the petitioner association, Salahuddin Gandapur, asserted that around 60,000 Qingqi rickshaws have been operating in the city and the ban was imposed without consulting the petitioner.\n\nHe also argued that not only the poor drivers and their families were affected by such a move, but the middle class had also been suffering due to the non-availability of the “cheapest” means of travel.\n\nThe lawyer further maintained that every citizen has the right to earn a livelihood by a legal profession and all the vehicles in question had been purchased from approved companies, while the departments concerned had also issued registration, fitness certificates and permits to those rickshaws.\n\nThe petitioner contended that initially, the provincial authorities had imposed such a ban in 2013 and the same was challenged through a petition before the SHC, but it was dismissed in 2015.\n\nHowever, it was also argued that the petitioner had challenged the same before the apex court, which had disposed of the matter in 2017, allowing the plying of Qingqi rickshaws with certain conditions.\n\nThe association asserted that the commissioner, in the impugned notification, had given the reason of traffic hazards and congestion for the ban, but in fact, illegal encroachments and parking on the roads were causing traffic problems, and the government had never attempted to resolve such issues and instead imposed the ban on rickshaws.\n\nIt submitted many applications to various departments concerned, pointing out the real factors behind the traffic jams, but to no avail.\n\nThe petitioner further maintained that the government has never imposed a ban on legally acquired vehicles plying on the roads and therefore the impugned notification was not sustainable in the eyes of law.\n\nThe petitioner asserted that the impugned notification was issued in violation of Articles 8, 9, 10, 21 and 25 of the Constitution and asked the SHC to set aside the impugned order.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
