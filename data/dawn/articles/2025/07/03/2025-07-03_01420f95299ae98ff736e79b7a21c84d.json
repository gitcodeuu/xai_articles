  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The auction of 5G spectrum in Pakistan remains on hold due to unresolved issues surrounding the proposed merger of Telenor Pakistan with Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (PTCL), as the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) awaits essential documentation from PTCL to finalise its decision.\n\nReliable sources revealed that the CCP’s progress has been hampered by PTCL’s reluctance or failure to submit the necessary documents in the prescribed format, creating confusion and stalling the evaluation process.\n\nMinister for IT and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja confirmed that the primary reason for the delay in the 5G spectrum auction is ongoing litigation and uncertainty over the PTCL-Telenor merger.\n\nAddressing the media, she stated, “The CCP is an independent body, and we are awaiting its decision on the proposed merger. Neither the IT Ministry nor the government can influence the Commission in the performance of its regulatory functions.”\n\nIT minister says govt can’t influence CCP; decision held up by PTCL’s ‘unclear’ submissions\n\nShe added that the 5G Spectrum Auction Advisory Committee, chaired by the finance minister, will issue its recommendations only after the CCP delivers its verdict on the merger.\n\nA senior official from the Ministry of IT told Dawn that the auction strategy hinges on the number of telecom operators post-merger. “The auction format depends on whether there are four or three players in the market. The layout and terms will be different in each case,” the official explained.\n\nCurrently, there are four telecom operators in Pakistan. Jazz leads with over 37pc market share, followed by Zong with 26pc, Telenor Pakistan with more than 22pc, and Ufone — PTCL’s subsidiary — with around 13pc of total SIM holders.\n\nOfficials noted that PTCL’s submissions to the CCP were “unclear” and failed to meet the standard requirements, prompting the watchdog to request further clarification.\n\nThe merger has also raised concerns due to the continued financial losses incurred by Ufone, in contrast to the profitability of the other three operators.\n\nA spokesperson for PTCL-Ufone did not respond to Dawn’s queries, despite the passage of several days.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
