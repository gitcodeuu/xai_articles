He successfully flew from that altitude and landed at base camp in 30 minutes, according to the organisers.\n\nMichael Beek, a German tour operator, mountain guide, and paragliding instructor, congratulated Göttler in a Facebook post, writing that Göttler had made a historic first.\n\n“Summiting Nanga Parbat in alpine style with Tiphaine Duperier and Boris Langenstein was incredible; but to be able to fly down from 7,700m all the way back to base camp on the same day has brought my joy to the next level,” he said.\n\nMeanwhile, his French companions, Duperier and Langenstein, camped the night at 7,625m, and later skied and trekked down the massive Rupal Face, which rises 4,600 meters from base camp, arriving three days later.\n\nTheirs is considered the first ski descent of the Rupal Face, and a first from the summit of Nanga Parbat.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
