  "content": "QUETTA: Lawmakers and experts at the inaugural consultative meeting of the Parliamentarians Forum on the Population Agenda have stressed the urgent need for coordinated efforts to implement the eight population-related recommendations of the Council of Common Interests (CCI).\n\nThe meeting, held in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the government of the Netherlands, the Balochistan Assembly and the provincial government, discussed the challenges posed by Pakistan’s rapidly growing population.\n\nIn her opening speech, UNFPA Provincial Coordinator Saadia Atta congratulated Balochistan Assembly representatives on establishing the forum, describing it as a vital platform for developing joint strategies and promoting meaningful parliamentary dialogue on population issues.\n\nUNFPA Country Representative Dr Luay Shabaneh spoke about Pakistan’s growing population pressure, its implications for public health, and the obstacles to socio-economic development.\n\nIdentifying three key focus areas — legislation, policy implementation and effective advocacy — Dr Shabaneh stressed the importance of integrated efforts between the population and health departments to improve services and ensure access to basic facilities.\n\nHadia Nawaz, parliamentary secretary for the Population Welfare Department, noted that the department is actively working to meet public needs and is expanding access to family planning services at the district level.\n\nDr Sarmad Khan, UNFPA’s technical specialist on Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH), delivered a detailed presentation highlighting alarming maternal and child health statistics in Balochistan.\n\nHe pointed to high maternal mortality rates, widespread malnutrition, school dropout rates and a lack of trained health personnel as critical challenges.\n\nParliamentary Secretary for Sports Meena Baloch expressed concern over the limited resources allocated to Balochistan through the National Finance Commission (NFC), stating that discussions on population control must consider this context. She called for reliable data on the reported 1,100 annual maternal deaths in the province.\n\nMPA Asfandyar Kakar emphasised the multiple challenges faced by Balochistan, including terrorism, economic instability and resource scarcity. He urged international organisations to provide greater support — particularly in the health sector — to ensure women and children have access to basic services.\n\nDeputy Speaker Ghazala Gola highlighted the shortage of family planning medicines and trained personnel, stressing the need to address early child marriages.\n\nOther participating legislators included Farah Azeem Shah, Kulsoom Niaz Baloch, Shahnaz Umrani, Salma Kakar, Khair Jan, Asghar Rind and Mir Jahanzeb Mengal.\n\nProvincial Education Minister Raheela Hameed Durrani underlined the significance of the forum and reaffirmed the Balochistan government’s commitment to achieving FP2030 goals. She expressed hope that a bill to end child marriage would soon be passed in the Balochistan Assembly and emphasised the need for collective action on the CCI recommendations, as well as awareness campaigns in educational institutions and stronger interprovincial coordination.\n\nAbdul Sattar Shahwani, divisional director of population welfare department, expressed concern over the inadequate budget allocations, noting that only Rs120 million had been allocated for family planning supplies and services.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
