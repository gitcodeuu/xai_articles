  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Senate Standing Committee on Housing and Works, chaired by Senator Nasir Mehmood, on Wednesday discussed several issues ranging from land encroachments to stalled infrastructure projects, with particular focus on the long-delayed Islamabad Central Jail project.\n\nThe committee expressed serious concern over the prolonged issue of land grabbing, especially in Murree. “There has been a land grab issue in Murree for 40 years,” said the committee chairman.\n\nMembers stressed that encroachment remains a persistent challenge. One member remarked, “It is a matter of time, if the squatters are alive, action must be taken against them.”\n\nIt is relevant to mention that Constantia Lodge, along with land bearing state numbers (Khasra Nos 43 and 44), comprising 4.6 acres situated at Kashmir Point in Murree, is at the centre of the dispute.\n\nIt is a pre-Partition property that was later handed over by the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB). In the past, the lodge was used by the Foreign Office for accommodating foreign missions and was once leased to the Brazilian embassy.\n\nIt was later transferred to the Public Works Department (PWD), which became part of the Ministry of Housing and Works in 1999. However, due to a dispute with locals and alleged encroachment, the ministry has not yet been able to take possession of the property.\n\nDuring the meeting, Senator Mehmood questioned the absence of the chief commissioner of Rawalpindi, who was expected to brief the committee about the property.\n\nThe additional chief commissioner informed the committee that the chief commissioner was unable to attend due to security duties related to Muharramul Haram.\n\nWhen the issue of the jail project was discussed, CDA officials informed the committee that the project, originally assigned to the PWD in 2013 and reallocated to the CDA in 2024, is facing severe funding gaps. “This year, a budget of Rs1 billion was approved, but an additional Rs2.5 billion is required,” CDA officials said.\n\nThey warned that without further funding, construction work would be delayed and costs would increase.\n\nThe chairman sought a clear timeline and asked, “If the money is received, how long will it take to complete the remaining work?” CDA officials responded, “The remaining 49 per cent can be completed in four months if funds are made available.”\n\nIt was disclosed that the Islamabad Central Jail is currently 51 per cent complete and is one of 15 ongoing projects under the Interior Ministry’s purview.\n\nSenator Mehmood underlined the urgency, stating, “If the work on the Central Jail is not completed this year, the cost will rise. Projects supposed to be completed in three years are taking fourteen. If a project is not completed on time, the responsibility falls on the Finance Division.”\n\nOfficials informed the committee that Rs1.32 billion has been released for FY 2024–25, but Rs2.5 billion more is needed to prevent further delays. The chairman urged the Ministry of Interior and the Planning Division to coordinate closely to ensure timely delivery.\n\n“If there are no savings, the prison project will not be completed,” he warned.\n\nThe committee also deliberated on the recruitment of personnel for the jail’s operationalisation, emphasising that the hiring process must align with the facility’s functional needs.\n\nOther matters discussed included overdue maintenance work at the Shaheed-e-Millat Secretariat on Jinnah Avenue, involving the replacement of five lifts and other essential repairs.\n\nOn housing matters, the committee was informed that a new mobile app will soon be launched to manage the general waiting list for residential allotments.\n\nWhile the list is already available online, Senator Mehmood emphasised the need for a more streamlined mechanism.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
