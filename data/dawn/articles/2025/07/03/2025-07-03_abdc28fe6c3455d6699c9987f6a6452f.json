But some relief is due to arrive from the Atlantic and spread across the continent.\n\nGermany’s national weather service (DWD) warned of “exceptionally high” temperatures reaching close to 40C degrees (104F) in places on Wednesday.\n\nIn Berlin, 18-year-old Nora said her strawberry stand on the side of the road felt “like a sauna” before temperatures had even reached their peak. Her boss had told her to close the stall if she felt unwell, as the German capital sweated under a hot sun, Nora said.\n\nThe heat was causing disruptions to transport, with Germany’s national rail operator Deutsche Bahn warning of impaired services in the west of the country, where temperatures were highest. In the north-west close to the city of Bremen, the heat had caused the surface of the motorway to buckle in places, creating a danger for drivers, local media reported.\n\nSpain reports four deaths; motorways warn of impaired services; rivers run low, causing problems for navigating waterways\n\nThe acute high temperatures added to an extended period of unusually hot and dry weather through the first half of the year. As well as an increased risk of forest fires, Germany’s rivers are also running low, causing problems for navigating the country’s waterways.\n\n‘Strange’\n\nIn the eastern city of Dresden, the level of the Elbe river has sunk to just 64 centimetres (25 inches), compared with an average of around two metres. Holger Boehme, the owner of a floating theatre said it was “strange” to see the usually wide river shrink to a fraction of its usual size.\n\n“There has always been high water and low water, but this type of extreme high water and extreme low is truly new in recent years,” Boehme said.\n\nThe current levels of Germany’s rivers were typically more likely to be seen at the end of the summer, Matthias Roeser from the Federal Association of German Inland Navigation said.\n\nIn France, temperatures had cooled slightly overnight into Wednesday but remained high. Paris was expected to experience highs of around 35C after hitting 40C on Tuesday, according to weather service Meteo-France. French Health Minister Catherine Vautrin confirmed it was “too early to take stock” of the consequences of the heatwave. But for the Paris metro area there had been a “serious” increase in emergency services’ activity of around 15 percent as the mercury rose.\n\nAn official estimate of the excess mortality linked to the heatwave would take two weeks for French authorities to compile, the ministry indicated.\n\n‘Feel the heat’\n\nResidents in Spain and Italy may have to wait until the weekend before they experience a drop in temperatures. In Madrid, care worker Grace Guerrero, 65, said she could really “feel the heat” but the air was cooler at her home outside the Spanish capital.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
