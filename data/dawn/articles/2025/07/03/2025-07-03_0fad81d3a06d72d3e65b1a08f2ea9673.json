  "content": "SWAT: Following the tragic Swat River incident, which claimed lives of over a dozen tourists, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has intensified its anti-encroachment operations across the rivers in Swat and Lower Dir.\n\nAfter a day’s break, the Swat district administration resumed operation against encroachments along banks of the Swat River on Wednesday. The operation began once again from Fizagat, where rooms built on the land of former governor Ghulam Ali were demolished. A boundary wall of the hotel belonging to PML-N senior leader and federal minister Amir Muqam was also razed.\n\nSeveral restaurants along the riverbank in Fizagat were also brought down. The restaurant owners pleaded with the administration that their livelihoods not be taken away as the buildings were located over 500 feet away from the river. However, the administration didn’t budge.\n\nDespite cancellation of lease agreements and imposition of Section 144, banning sand and gravel mining from the Swat River by the government, the contractors continued mining openly on Wednesday, locals said, adding mining was carried out at places where the administration was nowhere to be seen.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the district administration said 14 FIRs had been registered over the last 48 hours in Birkot tehsil over violation of the Section 144.\n\nOn Tuesday, Swat deputy commissioner Saleem Jan said all the lease agreements for mining in the Swat River had been cancelled.\n\nMeanwhile, during a large-scale crackdown being carried out along the banks of the Panjkora River in Lower Dir, nine buildings, including hotels and restaurants, have either been sealed or demolished.\n\nAccording to irrigation department sources, 38 illegal structures have been identified along a 30km stretch between Akhagram and Shago Kas. However, officials admitted the department had yet to formally demarcate the river boundaries, raising legal and procedural concerns over the demolitions.\n\nHowever, the administration insisted the operation followed due process, as prior notices were served to the individuals and entities in accordance with legal provisions.\n\nAlso, the Battagram tehsil municipal administration initiated an anti-encroachment drive along riverbanks and water courses in the district.\n\nDosti Rehman, TMA law enforcement officer, said the drive, launched in Thakot area, focused on removing unauthorised structures and encroachments built on riverbanks and water channels, including those in Khan Market and Thakot Main Bazaar.\n\nThe TMA team also cleared clogged drains to ensure smooth water flow and prevent flooding.\n\nAlso, the Bajaur district administration razed structures along rivers in various areas of the region the other day.\n\nAccording to a statement, 10 private structures, built illegally, including six marble factories, two stone-crushing plants, and two private guesthouses, were demolished in the Sheikh Kallay area of Khar tehsil.\n\nThe statement said an anti-encroachment team also sealed 13 stone-crushing plants operating on the banks of a nullah in the Danqool area of Salarzai tehsil.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
