He said the PTI would suggest amendments to the proposed Punjab Local Government Act.\n\nHe said the PTI would continue protesting ‘irregular’ payments of Rs10 trillion as reported by the Auditor General of Pakistan and added that this ‘Form-47’ government also got Rs509 billion supplementary budget with less than 23 members in the House.\n\nSays PTI to suggest amendments to proposed LG law\n\n“PML-N MPAs came in droves to listen to CM Maryam Nawaz’ speech but their number reduced to less than 25, when supplementary budget was passed,” he said.\n\nBhachar said the speaker suspended 26 opposition MPAs for protesting during CM’s speech but he had conveniently ignored the treasury MPAs’ protest and cheap slogans, when opposition women MPAs were speaking in the assembly. He said the speaker had neither notified the opposition parliamentary leader nor gave floor to the opposition leader despite repeated requests.\n\nHe said he had written a letter to the speaker to provide evidence explaining that the opposition members broke down microphones. He said the opposition would approach courts despite knowing that the courts were not giving justice to the opposition.\n\nThe opposition leader condemned the federal government for increasing petroleum prices and added that this increase would instantly shoot up the cost of daily-use items.\n\nAcknowledging the negligence in death of 17 persons in Swat River, Opposition Leader in Punjab Assembly Malik Ahmad Khan Bhachar said Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz should also be punished for the death of 20 children in a Pakpattan hospital.\n\n“Those negligent in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and in Punjab should be punished,” Mr Bhachar said.\n\nAnswering a question, the opposition leader said the political parties do keep their doors open for negotiations. He said party President Chaudhry Parvez Elahi was holding meetings and issuing instructions to them.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 3rd, 2025",
