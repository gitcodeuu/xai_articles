  "content": "LAHORE: Former Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) chief executive officer (CEO) has been dismissed from services after allegations of overbilling and corruption were proved in an internal inquiry.\n\nAccording to an official notification, former Lesco CEO Shahid Haider was found guilty of overbilling consumers for billions of rupees. He also failed to provide relevant record in his defence. The notification said that he would not receive any future benefits, including pension and free electricity supply privileges.\n\nThe prime minister’s investigative team also held him accountable in its findings.\n\nSources said that action against the former CEO was taken with the approval of the Lesco board of directors. The inquiry also revealed that multiple officers previously dismissed were allegedly reinstated through irregular means. Sources claimed that this was the first time in the history of distribution companies that an officer was removed post-retirement.\n\nSources said that action against other senior officers was expected in the next phase of the investigation. Other power sector companies also have similar allegations against them and punitive action is expected soon.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 12th, 2025",
