The man had gone with her to the front of a hotel under the pretence of asking for directions, then forced her into a room, the police said.\n\nThe suspect denied the charges and was quoted as saying, “I did not force her.”\n\nIn May, Japanese police said they arrested a former taxi driver on suspicion of drugging and raping a female passenger, with media reports saying police found about 3,000 videos and images of him sexually assaulting around 50 women in his taxi or his home.\n\nIn India, a court jailed a 31-year-old man for life in February following the rape and murder of a young Irish woman in the tourist resort state of Goa, nearly eight years after the crime.\n\nThe month prior, a Kolkata court handed a life sentence to a police volunteer convicted of the rape and murder of a doctor, a crime that sparked nationwide protests and hospital strikes last year.\n\nIn March 2024, police in Dumka district of India’s Jharkhand state arrested eight men in connection with the gang rape of a Spanish tourist.\n\nIn 2016, five Indians who raped a Danish tourist after she asked for directions in New Delhi were sentenced to life in prison.",
