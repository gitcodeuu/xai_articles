  "content": "LAHORE: Former Olym­p­ian and twice-elected pres­i­dent of the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), Akhtar Rasool Chaudhary, who currently serves as an advisor to the Asian Hoc­key Federation (AHF), has suggested that the upcoming Asia Cup — scheduled to be held in India —should either be moved to a neutral venue or, at the very least, Pakistan’s matches should be staged at a neutral location.\n\n“Given the current tension between India and Pakistan in the wake of the recent Pahalgam incident, I believe the AHF should consider relocating the event or arranging Pakis­tan’s fixtures at a neutral venue to ensure the safety of our players,” Akhtar told Dawn on Friday.\n\nHe noted that the matter was currently under consideration by the federal government.\n\n“As an advisor to the AHF, I have not yet been consulted formally, but when the time comes, I will provide my recommendation based on the prevailing circumstances,” he said.\n\nCiting a recent media report regarding the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) opting out of an Asian Cricket Council meeting in Bangladesh on political grounds, Akhtar said: “If cricket boards are taking such steps, the situation between India and Pakistan, verging on a war-like environment, should be treated even more cautiously.”\n\nHe emphasised that sending the team to India without clear assurances could pose a risk.\n\n“I don’t know what decision the government will ultimately take, but in my opinion, it should seek a formal guarantee from the Indian government ensuring the security of the Paki­stani contingent,” said Akhtar.\n\nWhile acknowledging the significance of the Asia Cup as a World Cup qualifier, Akhtar reiterated his stance that Pakistan’s participation must not come at the cost of player safety.\n\n“The Asia Cup is important for our qualification, but even then, hosting it at a neutral venue would be the ideal solution,” he noted, while also urging the PHF to begin preparations regar­dless of the uncertainty surrounding participation.\n\n“Instead of waiting for a final decision, the PHF should set up a training camp now, given the importance of the tournament for World Cup qualification,” noted the ex player.\n\nTurning to the broader state of the national game, Akhtar criticised the government’s lack of support for hockey.\n\n“Pakistan’s hockey history is illustrious, with titles in the Olympics, World Cup, Champions Trophy, and Asian competitions. Unfort­u­­nately, that legacy is not being honoured with the level of support required today,” he lamented. “Mer­ely providing travel and meals is not enough. Our team recently reached the final of the Nations Cup in Malaysia after a nine-mo­nth gap in international com­petition. The potential is there—but it needs investment and commitment.”\n\nAkhtar called for the formation of a consultative group comprising former hockey greats such as Samiullah, Hasan Sardar, Islahuddin, Manzoor-ul-Hasan Sr, and Shahnaz Sheikh to advise on reviving the sport.\n\nMeanwhile, PHF secretary Rana Mujahid told Dawn that no final decision had been made by the federal government regarding Pakistan’s participation in the Asia Cup.\n\n“We have briefed the government on all pros and cons of participating in the event, and we await their directive,” he said. “The PHF is also in touch with the AHF, but our participation remains subject to government approval.”\n\nRana added that while the PHF had confirmed its conditional participation to the AHF, the final decision would be aligned with instr­uctions from Islamabad.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 12th, 2025",
