  "content": "IN Washington, Pakistan and Israel’s Nobel Peace Prize nominee, joined by Israel’s MIT-educated prime minister, were recently toasting their shared success.\n\nWhile some differences exist, the duo considers its achievement epoch-making: the Arabs have been reduced to a defeated and demoralised lot, humbly offering as tithe a three trillion-dollar investment in America — with a personal jetliner as the topping. While Israel dropped bombs from the sky over Arab lands, regular flights of Gulf carriers to and from Tel Aviv continued undisturbed.\n\nBut the victories go further: Iran was once the outlier, the last to challenge US-Israeli domination of the entire Middle East. After 12 days of war its defiance is now merely token. Months earlier its allies in Lebanon and Yemen had been decimated. Mass starvation in Gaza — now just piles of rubble — has eviscerated Hamas. Meanwhile, Israeli soldiers with automatic weapons enjoy daily target practice with live ammunition on Palestinian children as they chase food trucks.\n\nPronouncing moral judgement on these two men may offer relief to some but to what end? Let’s recall that even the International Criminal Court was openly derided in Washington as a “kangaroo court” when it ordered Netanyahu’s arrest.\n\nSocial Darwinists and Bible Belt preachers propelled America into joining the Gaza genocide.\n\nBlaming individual leaders alone misses the point. No matter how powerful, they invariably reflect what their base wants. Consider that in 2024, as Netanyahu addressed the United States Congress amidst his hospital bombing campaign, American lawmakers — mostly Republicans but also many Democrats — repeatedly gave him standing ovations.\n\nWe surely need to dig deeper lest we miss the systemic forces shaping the mindset of both leaders as well as Western publics. To see why Israel wants to eliminate as many Palestinians as possible is easy. Over its entire history it has deliberately cultivated a Holocaust-driven us-or-them mentality. While Hamas’s October 7 attack on Israeli civilians was morally abhorrent, Israel has systematically sought to blame all violence on the people it has conquered.\n\nBut what about America? What beef does America have with Palestinians living half a world away? In the past, American presidents pursued their political objectives in the Middle East through “gentler” covert means like CIA-led coups and targeted assassinations but never through overt genocide captured on camera. The shift, I will argue below, owes to the rapid rise of Social Darwinism and evangelists of the Bible Belt.\n\nSocial Darwinism became a popular belief in 19th-century America soon after Darwin discovered the laws of biological selection. Darwin — a true scientist — forcefully rejected this “Darwinism” as extreme misapplication and distortion of his work. Nevertheless, the capitalist robber barons of his time found this piece of science very useful. British philosopher Herbert Spencer first coined the phrase “survival of the fittest” and advocated that this is the way things ought to be, not just how nature functioned. Society advances, he wrote, when “its fittest members are allowed to assert their fitness with the least hindrance.” The unfit should “not be prevented from dying out”.\n\nAmerica’s cowboy culture readily absorbed Spencer and, in time, Donald Trump inherited this mindset from his father, a property dealer. His political career, culminating in his presidency, was launched by his popular book, Think Big and Kick Ass: In Business and in Life. This crude title bespeaks its crude content: being self-serving and brazen brings success, and ultimately, success is all that matters, regardless of how it’s achieved.\n\nElon Musk — the richest man in the world and Trump’s ex-sidekick — couldn’t agree more. “The fundamental weakness of Western civilisation is empathy”, he declared, adding that “woke” liberals have weaponised empathy and are “exploiting a bug in Western civilisation.”\n\nMusk trashes social insurance such as Social Security, which he calls a “Ponzi scheme.” His newly launched political party will be still kinder to America’s ultra-rich and yet harsher on ordinary people. As for starving Palestinians: the fewer the better. What do they produce, he asked rhetorically.\n\nWhile heartlessness might explain why the US has stopped trying to feed the world’s hungry, it fails to explain why America helped Israel flatten Gaza. For that, we must glance at Trump’s political base. In 2024, Trump won over roughly 80 per cent of white conservative, evangelical Christian voters. (Incidentally, most conservative Pakistani-Americans also voted for Trump.)\n\nDuring my professional visits to the United States over the decades, I’ve often found myself watching white televangelists hawk their beliefs and marvelled at their well-honed delivery skills. Their core message: the Bible commands you to give your absolute support for Israel. Then, without batting an eyelid, they equate the Promised Land of Moses’s time with today’s nation-state of Israel.\n\nOne such preacher — later disgraced because of his weakness for women — I watched particularly. Jimmy Swaggart, who died last week, was a Christian Zionist who made his living off the Bible. “Israel is God’s prophetic time clock,” that heralds Armageddon and Jesus’s return to Earth, he sermonised. His son, Donnie Swaggart, carries on his mission today: “We must stand for Israel, for Jerusalem is the chosen city of God, where Jesus Christ, the King of Kings, will one day reign forever.”\n\nThat Trump ordered the US embassy to be shifted from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in his first presidency was surely not accidental.\n\nNo logical exercise can ever disprove what the Swaggarts and their ilk preach. Reason can never defeat faith, particularly when it stands behind a holy book. But what about Social Darwinism? Is that unassailable too?\n\nHere one can be more hopeful. Its nonsensical pseudo-scientific claims — virtuous people beget virtuous children being one — are readily disproven. But more importantly, as Darwin himself insisted, cooperation within the human species is fundamental for societal well-being. Cooperation, in turn, demands empathy. Without empathy we’d be living in a dystopic Muskian jungle populated by selfish individuals pursuing selfish needs.\n\nTo prevent more Gazas, people in every country must boldly confront their ingrained beliefs, repudiate pure selfishness, and internalise the profound truth that humanity is one. Else the scum shall continue rising to the top, eventually becoming that country’s political leaders.\n\nThe author is an Islamabad-based physicist and writer.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 12th, 2025",
