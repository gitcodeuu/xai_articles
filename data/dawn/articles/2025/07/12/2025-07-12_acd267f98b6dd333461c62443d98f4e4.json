Of the 12 available seats, one has been vacated by Sania Nishtar, while the remaining 11 seats are up for fresh election.\n\nThe breakdown of the 11 seats includes seven general seats and two each for women and technocrats. The deadline for submitting nomination papers expired on Friday, with scrutiny scheduled for July 16.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of ‘horse trading’ during the elections, Mr Kundi assured that the PPP is making efforts to prevent it, stressing that the key reason for the visit was to explore the potential for contesting the Senate elections together.\n\nQuestioned about the likelihood of a vote of no confidence against the KP government, Mr Kundi replied, “The no-confidence motion can be brought if the numbers are complete.”\n\nOn security concerns, the KP governor accused India of backing terrorist networks in Balochistan.\n\nHe added that Afghanistan’s land should not be used for Israel and India. “If our neighbour allows Israel and India to use its land, how will there be better relations with them?” he questioned.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 12th, 2025",
