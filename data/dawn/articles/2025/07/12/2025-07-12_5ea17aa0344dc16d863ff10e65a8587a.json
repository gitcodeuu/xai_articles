  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Stringent criteria set by Capital Development Authority (CDA) for awarding contract of Shaheen Chowk has kept majority of contractors away from the bidding process as the civic body received only one bid on Friday.\n\nThe lone bid was later rejected by the CDA, and management decided to go for tendering afresh. However, it is yet to be determined whether the new bid will be called on same criteria or otherwise. In his written reply, the CDA spokesperson said: “Only one bid was received, which has been rejected and we are going for re-tendering.”\n\nAs per procedure, the CDA first opens technical bids and after a few days of evaluation process, it goes for opening financial bid before awarding work orders.\n\nHowever, the over-confident lone bidder, without opening of the financial bid and without having a work order, mobilised his machinery towards the project site on Friday and started “initial bore testing work”. But, within few hours after opening of the bid, the CDA management decided to cancel the bid and go for re-tendering.\n\nCivic body management to go for tendering afresh\n\nUnder this project worth Rs 1.3 billion the CDA will construct an underpass at the junction of Khayaban-i-Iqbal and 9th Avenue. According to documents, the project, worth Rs1.3 billion, is supposed to be completed in 180 days.\n\nHowever, the qualification marks (eligibility criteria for companies) stated that 40 out of 100 marks are for work experience i.e. 20 marks for those companies that had completed a project worth at least Rs1.5 billion within 100 days during the last five years.\n\nSimilarly, 20 marks were set for those companies, currently executing any project worth Rs1.5 billion. Sources said since hardly few private companies can fulfill these stringent criteria, the CDA received only one bid of a contractor, which recently completed another mega project of CDA.\n\nWhereas, sources said the CDA in an astonishing move did not attach the design drawing with the tender documents when tender was floated 14 days ago. However, when some contractors raised objections, the CDA on July 9 - merely two days before opening of tender - uploaded the design drawing.\n\nIt is relevant to note here that the CDA had introduced such criteria for the Serena Interchange, which was later named ‘Jinnah Square Interchange’, and the F-8 interchange, as it wanted to get these projects completed on an urgent basis. However, issues surfaced in both these projects: the design of the F-8 interchange is still questionable while the Jinnah Square interchange is facing drainage issues.\n\n“I fail to understand why the CDA management wanted to complete the development work immediately. The underpasses and interchanges are constructed for decades, therefore, such projects should not be executed in haste to avoid technical faults, which later haunt the civic agency,” an official said.\n\nThe official said instead of introducing harsh criteria, the CDA should encourage maximum companies for healthy competitions so that the civic agency gets a good rate.\n\nA CDA officer, however, defended the said criteria, stating that the civic agency wanted reputed companies with vast experience to execute such projects to avoid cost escalation and provide relief to citizens.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 12th, 2025",
