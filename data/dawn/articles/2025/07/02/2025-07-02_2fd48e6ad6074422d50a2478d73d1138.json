A gentle jolt to the brain might help.\n\nA new study published on Tuesday in PLOS Biology suggests that mild electrical stimulation can boost arithmetic performance — and offers fresh insight into the brain mechanisms behind mathematical ability, along with a potential way to optimise learning.\n\nThe findings could eventually help narrow cognitive gaps and help build a more intellectually equitable society, the authors argue.\n\n“Different people have different brains, and their brains control a lot in their life,” said Roi Cohen Kadosh, a neuroscientist at the University of Surrey who led the research.\n\n“We think about the environment — if you go to the right school, if you have the right teacher — but it’s also our biology.” Cohen Kadosh and colleagues recruited 72 University of Oxford students, scanning their brains to measure connectivity between three key regions.\n\nParticipants then tackled math problems that required either calculating answers or recalling memorised solutions.\n\nThey found that stronger connections between the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which governs executive function, and the posterior parietal cortex, involved in memory, predicted better calculation performance.\n\nWhen the researchers applied a painless form of brain stimulation using electrode-fitted caps — a technique known as transcranial random noise stimulation — the low performers saw their scores jump by 25-29 percent.\n\nThe team believes the stimulation works by enhancing the excitability of neurons and interacting with GABA, a brain chemical that inhibits excessive activity.\n\nIn fact, the stimulation helped underperformers reach or even surpass the scores of peers with naturally stronger brain wiring. But those who already performed well saw no benefit.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
