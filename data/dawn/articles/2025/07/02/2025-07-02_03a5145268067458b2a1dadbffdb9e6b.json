  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Mi­­nistry of Maritime Affairs on Tuesday notified a 50 per cent reduction in port charges for export-orien­ted cargo at Port Qasim in a move aimed at facilitating exporters and enhancing the port’s competitiveness.\n\nThe reduced rates, effective immediately, apply to wharfage and trans shipment container charges for a period of one year.\n\nThe decision also includes concessions at Marginal Wharf Berths 1 and 2, as well as at the Fotco and Fauji Akbar Portia terminals.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Minister for Maritime Affairs Junaid Anwar Chaudhry said the government’s move is intended to support exporters and attract more traffic to Port Qasim.\n\n“While the ministry is working to attract cargo from Central Asian countries to Pakistani ports, it is crucial to make our ports regionally competitive,” he said.\n\nHe added that Pakistan is in discussions with Uzbekistan to route its seaborne trade through Pakistani ports. At present, most Central Asian countries rely on European or Iranian ports for international shipments.\n\nAs part of the reforms, handling charges for LNG cargoes have also been reduced. Charges for containerised cargo at DP World terminal have been halved, though no concessions will apply to empty containers.\n\nThe Ministry of Maritime Affairs said the changes are designed to promote exports and trade activity.\n\nA formal notification has been issued, with implementation beginning from Tuesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
