The resolution demands that Israel cease all settlement activities in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.\n\nHowever, the discussion also covered the risk of famine in Gaza and a new aid mechanism conducted by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation — a non-UN entity backed by Israel and the United States.\n\nIn sharply worded remarks, the Pakistani envoy said the new aid distribution mechanism is not only contrary to international humanitarian law and human dignity, but it also places starving civilians in direct danger, forcing them to cross active combat zones in search of food and water.\n\n“The result is a grotesque cycle of horror: over 500 people have been killed while trying to access humanitarian aid,” Ambassador Ahmad said. “This is a death trap.”\n\nHe added, “The failure to enforce the Council’s own decisions carries grave consequences for global peace and security and undermines the Council’s own authority and credibility.”\n\nAt the outset, UN Assistant Secretary-General for the Middle East Khaled Khiari warned that the level of suffering and brutality in Gaza was unbearable, calling the continued collective punishment of Palestinians unjustifiable.\n\n‘Deep sense of purpose’\n\nMeanwhile, as Pakistan has assumed the UNSC presidency for the current month, the Foreign Office said in a statement that the country “undertakes this responsibility with a deep sense of purpose, humility and conviction. Our approach will continue to remain anchored in the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect for international law, and a steadfast commitment to multilateralism”.\n\nAs a country that has consistently advocated for dialogue and diplomacy, Pakistan brings to the Security Council an objective, principled, and balanced perspective shaped by its foreign policy, past experience at the Council, and its long-standing contributions to the maintenance of international peace and security, including through UN peacekeeping and peace-building efforts, it said.\n\nThe presidency will convene two high-level signature events during this month: an open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes”, to be held on July 22; and a briefing on “Cooperation between the United Nations and Regional and Sub-Regional Organisations: The Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)”, scheduled for July 24.\n\nBoth meetings will be chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who will also preside over the quarterly open debate on the Question of Palestine on 23 July 2025. Mr Dar will also preside over the quarterly open debate on Palestine.\n\n“Pakistan looks forward to working closely with all Council members to promote timely and united action, in line with the Council’s Charter responsibilities and the expectations of the international community,” the Foreign Office said.\n\nMr Dar said Pakistan takes on this responsibility with humility, conviction, and a profound commitment to the UN Charter.\n\n“Our presidency comes at a time of escalating conflicts and humanitarian crises across the world. We will strive to steer the Security Council towards responsive and effective action grounded in dialogue, diplomacy and peaceful dispute resolution”, he said on a post on X.\n\nIn a separate address on the future of the UN’s counterterrorism architecture, Ambassador Ahmad called for addressing the root causes of terrorism — particularly unresolved conflicts, foreign occupation and systemic injustice.\n\n“The UN’s counterterrorism discourse must not only address the response factors but also the underlying and preventive factors,” he said.\n\nWith input from APP\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
