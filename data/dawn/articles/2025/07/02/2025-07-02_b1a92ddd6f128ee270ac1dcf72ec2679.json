  "content": "Sean “Diddy” Combs was found guilty on Wednesday of prostitution-related offences by a United States jury but cleared of more serious charges, in a blow to prosecutors who had urged the panel to find him guilty of racketeering conspiracy and sex trafficking.\n\nCombs was convicted of transportation to engage in prostitution but acquitted of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking, a partial win for the former billionaire known for elevating hip-hop in American culture.\n\nThe verdict followed a criminal trial in which two of the music mogul’s former girlfriends testified that he physically and sexually abused them.\n\nCombs faces a maximum 10-year prison sentence on each of the two prostitution counts. US District Judge Arun Subramanian will determine Combs’ sentence at a later date.\n\nThe acquittals on the sex trafficking counts mean he will avoid a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence. He could have faced life in prison if he were convicted of sex trafficking or racketeering conspiracy.\n\nAfter the jury read its verdict, defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo asked Subramanian to release Combs on bail. “He has been acquitted of very, very serious charges. He has been convicted of a far less serious charge,” Agnifilo said.\n\nProsecutor Maurene Comey urged Subramanian to keep Combs behind bars pending sentencing, citing testimony about Combs’ alleged physical abuse. She said prosecutors would still be seeking a “substantial period of incarceration” at sentencing.\n\n“It is clear that the defendant does pose a danger,” Comey said.\n\nProsecutors say Combs, for two decades, used his business empire to force two of his romantic partners to take part in drug-fuelled, days-long sexual performances sometimes known as “Freak Offs” with male sex workers in hotel rooms while Combs watched, masturbated and occasionally filmed.\n\nDuring raids of Combs’ homes, authorities found drugs and 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant that he would use in the performances, prosecutors said.\n\nCombs, 55, had pleaded not guilty to all five counts.\n\nHis lawyers acknowledged that the Bad Boy Records founder, once famed for hosting lavish parties for the cultural elite in luxurious locales such as the Hamptons and Saint-Tropez, was at times violent in his domestic relationships. But they said the sexual activity described by prosecutors was consensual.\n\nThe seven-week trial in Manhattan federal court exposed the inner workings of Combs’ business empire and gave the 12-member jury an intimate look into his volatile romantic relationships with the rhythm and blues singer Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and a woman known in court by the pseudonym Jane.\n\nVentura sued Combs in November 2023 for sex trafficking, the first of dozens of civil lawsuits accusing him of abuse. Combs, also known throughout his career as ‘Puff Daddy’ and ‘P Diddy’ and once feted for turning artists such as Notorious BIG and Usher into stars, settled with Ventura for $20 million.\n\nHe has denied all wrongdoing. At the trial, jurors saw surveillance footage from 2016 showing Combs kicking and dragging Ventura in the hallway of an InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles, where she said she was trying to leave a “Freak Off”.\n\nJane later testified that Combs, in June 2024, attacked her and directed her to perform oral sex on a male entertainer, even though she told him she did not want to.\n\nThat alleged attack took place a month after Combs apologised on social media for his 2016 attack on Ventura, footage of which had been broadcast on CNN.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, physical violence was just one way Combs compelled Ventura and Jane to take part in the performances — an act of coercion they say amounts to sex trafficking because the male escorts were paid.\n\nBoth women testified that he threatened to withhold financial support and to leak sexually explicit images of them if they refused to comply.\n\n“The defendant used power, violence and fear to get what he wanted,” prosecutor Christy Slavik said in her closing argument on June 26. “He doesn’t take no for an answer.”\n\nCombs’ defence lawyers argued that while Combs may have committed domestic violence in the context of volatile romantic partnerships, his conduct did not amount to sex trafficking.\n\nThey argued that Ventura and Jane were strong, independent women who voluntarily took part in the sexual performances because they wanted to please Combs.\n\nBoth women testified they spent time with Combs and took part in sexual performances after he beat them. Defence lawyers argued that Ventura and Jane were retrospectively accusing Combs of forcing their participation in the performances because they were jealous he was seeing other women.\n\n“If he was charged with domestic violence, we wouldn’t all be here,” Combs’ defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said in his closing argument on June 27. “He did not do the things he’s charged with.”\n\nBesides Ventura and Jane, jurors also heard testimony from Combs’ former personal assistants who said their jobs included setting up hotel rooms for “Freak Offs” and buying their boss drugs.\n\nAn InterContinental security guard testified that Combs, in the presence of his chief of staff, paid him $100,000 to hand over what he thought was the only copy of the surveillance tape of his attack on Ventura.\n\nAnd Scott Mescudi, the rapper known as Kid Cudi, told jurors that Combs was likely involved in an arson on his car after Combs found out he was romantically involved with Ventura.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, those were all acts Combs and his associates undertook in furtherance of a racketeering conspiracy whose aim was, in part, to facilitate his abuse and keep evidence of his wrongdoing under wraps.\n\nThe defence argued Combs was a successful entrepreneur who used drugs recreationally, but kept his professional and personal lives separate.\n\nCombs has been held in federal lockup in Brooklyn since his September 2024 arrest.",
