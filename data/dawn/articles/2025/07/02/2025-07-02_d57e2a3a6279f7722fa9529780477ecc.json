  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Competition Ap­­pe­l­late Tribunal has dismissed an appeal filed by Reckitt Benckiser in the Strepsils case due to non-prosecution, as the company’s counsel failed to appear, citing travel abroad — the same reason presented at the previous hearing.\n\nThe tribunal rejected the adjournment request and noted that a fine of Rs50,000 had earlier been imposed on the counsel for failing to appear. With no appearance once again, the appeal was dismissed.\n\nIn 2021, the Competition Commission of Pakistan imposed a penalty of Rs150 million on the company for misleading advertising that implied Strepsils was a medicated remedy for sore throat.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
