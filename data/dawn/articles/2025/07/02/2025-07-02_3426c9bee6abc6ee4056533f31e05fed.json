She expressed her gratitude to the chief minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and advisor to the CM on finance for their continued guidance and support.\n\nShe also extended her heartfelt appreciation to the taxpayers of KPRA for their consistent trust and cooperation. “Our taxpayers are the cornerstone of our revenue system. Their compliance and commitment have made this unprecedented achievement possible,” she said, adding that her team was committed to facilitating the taxpayers through a transparent and taxpayer-friendly environment.\n\n“It is yet another proud milestone for KPRA — we have not only met but surpassed our revenue targets with an impressive surplus, reflecting the dedication and professionalism of our team,” she said.\n\n“If we maintain the same spirit and commitment, I am confident that we will exceed next year’s targets as well and continue to contribute towards making Khyber Pakhtunkhwa a fiscally self-reliant province,” she said in her statement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
