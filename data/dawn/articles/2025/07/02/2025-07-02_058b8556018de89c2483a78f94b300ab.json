The security guard is now in police custody,” the statement added.\n\n“Breaking the law and humiliating the public will not be tolerated,” the Power Division warned, highlighting that it took strict action against the guard’s misconduct.\n\nThe statement added that action was being taken to dismiss the security guard from his job and that the Power Division ordered an inquiry report to be furnished within three days.\n\nOrders were also forwarded to other power supply and distribution companies to “take immediate steps and issue instructions to all offices”.\n\n“The Power Division apologises to the elderly woman and other consumers for this individual’s act,” the statement read. “We highly respect our consumers.”\n\nThe Sheikhupura Police also confirmed the man’s arrest in a post on Facebook, detailing that the viral footage prompted District Police Officer (DPO) Bilal Zafar Sheikh to take notice of the incident.\n\n“Police arrested the suspect and registered a case,” DPO Sheikh was quoted as saying. “No one is allowed to take the law into their own hands.”",
