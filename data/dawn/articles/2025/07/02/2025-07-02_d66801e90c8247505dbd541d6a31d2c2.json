However, they highlighted a shift in the final quarter of FY25, when a steep decline in interest rates encouraged greater borrowing activity.\n\nDespite a significant cut in interest rates from 22pc to 11pc during FY25, the private sector response remained cautious. Borrowing levels still fell short of those seen in FY22, when the sector borrowed Rs1.33tr — marking a 17.4pc increase that year.\n\nAnalysts point to the political and economic turmoil following the change in government during FY23 as a key factor behind the collapse in private sector activity. That year saw negative GDP growth and minimal borrowing.\n\nThe private sector is widely recognised as a critical driver of economic development, fuelling investment, employment and business creation. However, its performance remains closely tied to the broader governance environment, which shapes its competitiveness and capacity for growth.\n\nIn a recent report, the State Bank observed that Pakistan’s credit-to-GDP ratio has been declining for decades and is among the lowest in the region. This has hindered growth, job creation and poverty reduction.\n\nThe SBP identified both demand and supply side constraints, including high borrowing costs, shallow financial markets, crowding out by government borrowing, and banks’ preference for lending to blue-chip corporates. Structural challenges, such as the energy crisis, also continue to weigh on credit expansion.\n\nThe SBP maintained a tight monetary policy through FY24, keeping the policy rate at 22pc to curb inflation, which ended the year at 24pc. Though inflation began ticking up again in May, analysts expect no sharp surge in the near term. However, banks’ continued preference for investing in government securities over private lending may limit the private sector’s ability to return to FY22 borrowing levels.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
