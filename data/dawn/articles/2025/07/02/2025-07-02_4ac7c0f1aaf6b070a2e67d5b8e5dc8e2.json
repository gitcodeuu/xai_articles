  "content": "A satellite backed by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has been lost in space while carrying out an important climate change mission, New Zealand officials said on Wednesday.\n\nDesigned to measure greenhouse gas emissions with “unprecedented resolution”, the MethaneSAT space probe was also funded by Wellington and the US-based Environmental Defence Fund.\n\nPlagued with technical problems, the satellite recently stopped responding to its Earth-bound controllers.\n\n“Clearly, this is a disappointing development,” said Andrew Johnson, a senior official at the New Zealand Space Agency.\n\n“As those who work in the space sector know, space is inherently challenging, and every attempt — successful or not — pushes the boundaries of what we know and what we’re capable of.”\n\nThe Environmental Defence Fund, which led the project, said it was “difficult news” but would not be the end of its methane-tracking efforts.\n\nMethaneSAT was designed to measure emissions of the potent greenhouse gas, which fuels climate change by trapping heat in the planet’s atmosphere.\n\nIt has proven notoriously difficult to get accurate estimates of the methane emissions belched out by oil and gas projects around the globe.\n\n“It was one of the most advanced methane tracking satellites in space, measuring methane emissions in oil and gas producing regions across the world,” the MethaneSAT team said.\n\nProject lead Steven Hamburg said initial data gleaned by the satellite was “remarkable”.\n\n“Recent measurements in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico revealed emissions three to five times higher than estimated by the US Environmental Protection Agency, while emissions observed in the South Caspian region are over 10 times higher than reported,” Hamburg wrote on LinkedIn.\n\nMethaneSAT was launched into space in March 2024 on the back of a SpaceX rocket fired from California.\n\nControllers first lost contact with the satellite on June 20, the MethaneSAT team said in a statement.\n\nThey confirmed it had lost all power on Monday this week and was “likely not recoverable”.\n\n“The engineering team is conducting a thorough investigation into the loss of communication,” MethaneSAT said. “This is expected to take time. We will share what we learn.”\n\nDespite its shorter-than-expected lifespan, MethaneSAT hailed the mission as a “remarkable success in terms of scientific and technological accomplishment”.\n\nThe satellite eventually succumbed after overcoming a string of technical glitches.\n\nIt repeatedly entered a sleep, or stand-by, mode without prompting — forcing engineers to perform a lengthy reset each time.\n\nOne of its three thrusters also failed.",
