The first option is to apply by visiting any facility nearby and the second is to apply online.\n\nTo do so, they need to visit the official website (https://excise.gos.pk) or mobile app, click on the “Quick Online Pay Taxes” option, and enter their mobile number along with the vehicle’s registration number. A new window will then pop up, allowing them to apply for a replacement number plate and selecting the facility to collect the number plate.\n\nFor four-wheelers, the fee is approximately Rs2,450, while for two-wheelers, it is around Rs1,850. The payment can be made through online banking or any supported digital payment platform or paying challan in bank.\n\nFor those who have already applied for the replacement of a number plate, they can check the current status by visiting the department’s official website and clicking on the “Check Your Number Plate” option.\n\nAnd if you are lucky enough that your number plate has been delivered to your selected excise branch, you will need to bring the original file and old number plate regardless it was in any condition with you to collect the new Ajrak-designed number plate. However, if you had lost your old number plate then you need to apply for duplicate number.\n\nMixed signals confuse public\n\nAccording to the excise ministry, the deadline for mandatory Nadra biometric verification for vehicle owners applicable to sellers has been extended till August 14.\n\nHowever, many vehicle owners who had applied for replacement number plates months ago complained that they had yet to receive them.\n\nIn the meantime, a growing number of vehicle owners have turned to locally made number plates to avoid action by the traffic police, claiming that officers are allowing the use of white-background plates with Ajrak patterns until the originals are issued.\n\nThis has further contributed to the confusion and a communication gap between the two government departments, forcing vehicle owners to spend additional money on locally made number plates that resemble the government-issued ones.\n\nConflicting announcements\n\nThe traffic police, through their official social media platforms, have announced that only “government-issued or closely resembling number plates” will be accepted. Otherwise, vehicles will be subject to challans or seizure.\n\nOn the other hand, the excise department has maintained that aftermarket number plates will not be accepted under any circumstances, as allowing them would undermine the objectives of the Safe City initiative.\n\nResponding to a question about the backlog at excise facilities in Karachi, Atif Ali Bhatti — in-charge of the motor registration facility at the Civic Centre — said that applicants who submitted requests for the new design number plates in mid-February had already received them or delivered at their selective branch. However, the backlog that developed afterwards had yet to be cleared as of the first week of July, he claimed.\n\nMr Bhatti also acknowledged a video circulating on social media in which traffic police personnel were seen encouraging people to use “government-issued or closely resembling number plates”.\n\nHe clarified that it is incorrect to use aftermarket plates — which lack any security features — as doing so would undermine the very purpose of the Safe City initiative.\n\nHe further stated that the newly designed number plates are embedded with multiple security features, enabling surveillance cameras to detect and read them clearly, even at night.\n\nShow the receipt\n\nThe excise ministry has advised vehicle owners that if their new number plates have not yet been issued, they should carry the official receipt of the replacement of plates and present it to traffic police or any concerned authority when asked.\n\n“If someone has the official receipt and the original old number plate installed to their vehicle, then morally, the traffic police should not issue a fine,” said ministry spokesperson Shabbir Ali Babar.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, a traffic police spokesperson, Mr Sohail, said that if vehicle owners have been issued the Ajrak-themed number plates, they should install them. However, if the plates have not yet been issued, then owners may use aftermarket plates to avoid using fancy ones.\n\nWhen asked about the excise department’s statement that until the new plates are issued, vehicle owners can install the original old number plate along with the replacement receipt, he said he was not aware of any such statement issued by the excise department and could not comment at this time.\n\nDawn attempted to get comments from the DIG Traffic Karachi but did not receive his response.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
