  "content": "WASHINGTON: Foreign ministers from the Group of Seven nations said on Monday they supported the ceasefire between Israel and Iran and called for negotiations to resume for a deal to address Tehran’s nuclear programme, according to a joint statement.\n\nSince April, Iran and the US have held talks aimed at finding a new diplomatic solution regarding Iran’s nuclear programme. Tehran says its programme is peaceful, but Israel and its allies say they want to ensure Iran cannot build a nuclear weapon.\n\n“We call for the resumption of negotiations, resulting in a comprehensive, verifiable and durable agreement that addresses Iran’s nuclear programme,” the G7 foreign ministers said.\n\nLast week, Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran to halt a war that began on June 13 when Israel attacked Iran. The conflict had raised alarms in a region already on edge since the start of Israel’s assault on Gaza in Oct 2023.\n\nBefore the ceasefire was announced, Washington struck Iran’s nuclear sites and Iran targeted a US base in Qatar in retaliation.\n\nThe G7 foreign ministers said they urged “all parties to avoid actions that could further destabilise the region.” Washington’s Middle East Envoy Steve Witkoff has said talks between US and Iran were “promising” and that Washington was hopeful for a long-term peace deal.\n\nThe G7 top diplomats denounced threats against the head of the UN nuclear watchdog on Monday, after a hardline Iranian newspaper said IAEA boss Rafael Grossi should be tried and executed as an Israeli agent.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 2nd, 2025",
