  "content": "KARACHI: After failing to attract any bids in a previous attempt, the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has issued a fresh international tender to import 100,000 tonnes of white refined sugar in a bid to stabilise domestic prices.\n\nThe new tender, issued on Friday, doubles the earlier procurement target of 50,000 tonnes. The deadline for submission of price offers is July 31.\n\nAccording to foreign media reports, no bids were received in the earlier tender due to what traders described as unrealistic shipment and arrival timelines. In res­ponse, TCP has adjusted the delivery windows in the new tender.\n\nFor break-bulk cargo, the shipment period for the first 50,000 tonnes is set between Aug 21 and Sept 5, and for the second 50,000 tonnes between Sept 1 and 15. For sugar transported in ocean containers, shipment can be made from August 21 to September 10. The sugar can be sourced from any origin except India and Israel.\n\nTraders remain puzzled by the government’s sugar trade policy. During FY25, Pakistan exported 765,734 tonnes of sugar, generating $411 million in foreign exchange, with an average per tonne price of $537. By contrast, only 33,101 tonnes were exported in FY24, earning just $21m.\n\nDespite the export surge earlier this year, domestic consumers are now grappling with rising prices.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
