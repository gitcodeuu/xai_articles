  "content": "WASHINGTON: SpaceX’s Starlink satellite network was back up and running on Friday as engineers hunted for the root cause of one of its biggest international outages the night before, a rare disruption for the powerful internet system set off by an internal software failure.\n\nUsers in the US and Europe began experiencing the outage at around 1900 GMT (12am PKT) on Thursday, according to Downdetector, a crowdsourced outage tracker that said as many as 61,000 user reports to the site were made.\n\nIn Ukraine, where troops rely heavily on Starlink for battlefield communications, the outage affected combat operations as service was “down across the entire front”, said Robert Brovdi, the commander of Ukraine’s drone forces.\n\nStarlink, active in roughly 140 countries and territories and used by a growing number of militaries and government agencies, is a key source of revenue for Elon Musk’s SpaceX.\n\nThe network has grown rapidly since 2020 into a disruptive force in the satellite communications industry.\n\nStarlink acknowledged the outage on its X account and said “we are actively implementing a solution”.\n\nThe service mostly resumed after two, Michael Nicolls, SpaceX vice president of Starlink Engineering, wrote on X. The company wrote on X four hours later that the “network issue has been resolved, and Starlink service has been restored”.\n\n“The outage was due to failure of key internal software services that operate the core network,” Nicolls said, apologising for the disruption and vowing to find its cause.\n\nMusk also apologised: “Sorry for the outage. SpaceX will remedy root cause to ensure it doesn’t happen again,” the SpaceX CEO wrote on X.\n\nThe outage was a rare hiccup for SpaceX’s most commercially sensitive business. Experts speculated whether the service, known for its resilience and speedy development, was beset by a glitch, a botched software update or perhaps a cyberattack.\n\nDoug Madory, an expert at the internet analysis firm Kentik, said such a sweeping global outage was unusual.\n\n“This is likely the longest outage ever for Starlink, at least while it became a major service provider,” Madory said.\n\nAs Starlink amasses more than six million users, SpaceX has focused in recent months on updating its network to accommodate demands for higher speed and bandwidth.\n\nThe company, in a partnership with T-Mobile, is also expanding the constellation with larger, more powerful satellites to offer direct-to-cell text messaging services, a line of business in which mobile phone users can send emergency text messages through the network in rural areas.\n\nSpaceX has launched more than 8,000 Starlink satellites since 2020, building a uniquely distributed network in low-Earth orbit that has attracted intense demand from militaries, transportation industries and consumers in rural areas with poor access to traditional, fiber-based internet.\n\n“I’d speculate this is a bad software update, not entirely dissimilar to the CrowdStrike mess with Windows last year, or a cyberattack,” said Gregory Falco, director of a space and cybersecurity aboratory at Cornell University.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
