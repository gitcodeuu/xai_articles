But subsequent remarks from Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu — who said Tel Aviv was now mulling “alternative” options to bring its prisoners home — suggested Israel’s position had hardened overnight.\n\n“Hamas really didn’t want to make a deal. I think they want to die. And it’s very bad. And it got to be to a point where you’re going to have to finish the job,” Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nSenior Hamas official Basem Naim said on Facebook that the talks had been constructive, and criticised Witkoff’s remarks as aimed at exerting pressure on Israel’s behalf.\n\n“What we have presented — with full awareness and understanding of the complexity of the situation — we believe could lead to a deal if the enemy had the will to reach one,” he said.\n\nThe proposed ceasefire would suspend fighting for 60 days, allow more aid into Gaza, and free some of the 50 remaining hostages held by militants in return for Palestinian prisoners jailed in Israel.\n\nIt has been held up by disagreement over how far Israel should withdraw its troops and the future beyond the 60 days if no permanent agreement is reached.\n\nMeanwhile, a joint statement from mediators Qatar and Egypt said there has been some progress in the latest round of ceasefire talks, and that suspending the negotiations to hold consultations before resuming talks is normal in the context of these complex negotiations.\n\nThe statement said both countries were pressing on with efforts to mediate talks to end the Gaza war.\n\nEuropean appeal\n\nMeanwhile, the leaders of Britain, France and Germany called for the “humanitarian catastrophe” in the Gaza Strip to “end now”, and asked Israel to “immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid and urgently allow the UN and humanitarian NGOs to carry out their work in order to take action against starvation”.\n\nA joint statement from British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said that “the most basic needs of the civilian population, including access to water and food, must be met without any further delay”.\n\n“Withholding essential humanitarian assistance to the civilian population is unacceptable,” they said. “Israel must uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law.”\n\n“We urge all parties to bring an end to the conflict by reaching an immediate ceasefire.”\n\n“We stand ready to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire and a political process that leads to lasting security and peace for Israelis, Palestinians and the entire region,” they said.\n\nFrance defends move\n\nAlso on Friday, France defended its decision to recognise Palestinian statehood amid domestic and international criticism.\n\nPresident Emmanuel Macron said Thursday that his country would formally recognise a Palestinian state during a UN meeting in September, the most powerful European nation to announce such a move.\n\nMacron’s announcement drew condemnation from Israel, which said it “rewards terror”, while US Secretary of State Marco Rubio called it “reckless” and said it “only serves Hamas propaganda”.\n\nHamas itself praised the French initiative, saying it was “a positive step in the right direction toward doing justice to our oppressed Palestinian people”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
