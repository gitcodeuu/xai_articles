Developing countries like Pakistan need inclusive and transparent access to climate finance, technology, and adaptation support,” said Dr Malik, adding the world could not afford delay.\n\n“The Paris Agreement must be honoured in both letter and spirit.”\n\nThe federal minister expressed these views during the COP29 Heads of Delegation Retreat held in Shamakhi, Azerbaijan, on Friday.\n\nThe retreat, a closed-door dialogue between Heads of Delegation from across the globe, aimed to build trust and chart a path toward meaningful outcomes at COP29, scheduled for later this year.\n\nSpeaking at the high-level gathering, Dr Malik emphasised the need for climate justice, equity, and stronger collaboration between the Global North and South in tackling the escalating climate crisis.\n\nHe highlighted Pakist­an’s acute vulnerability to climate change, noting that despite contributing minimally to global emissions, the country faces severe climate-related disasters, including floods, droughts, and extreme heat.\n\nDiscussions focused on key unresolved issues such as climate financing, loss and damage mechanisms, and bridging the implementation gap in emissions reduction pledges.\n\nDr Malik reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to a climate-resilient and sustainable development pathway, and its active participation in shaping a fair and effective international climate framework.\n\nHe called on developed nations to meet their pledged contributions to the $100 billion climate finance goal under the 2015 Paris Agreement to help poorer countries cope with climate impacts.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
