I saw how US support is helping preserve this magnificent monument and demonstrate our long-term partnership. The people-to-people ties and cultural bonds are what underpin our work.”\n\nMs Horst’s appointment, though temporary, is seen as both strategic and symbolic.\n\nHer arrival signals Washington’s continued interest in maintaining high-level engagement with Islamabad, even as the Trump administration calibrates its broader South Asia policy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
