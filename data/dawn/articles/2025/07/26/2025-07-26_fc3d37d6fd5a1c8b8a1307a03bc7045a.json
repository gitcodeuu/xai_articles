The minister expressed interest in expanding collaboration with leading research institutions in China and Pakistan.\n\nFood minister says govt committed to reviving Agricultural Research Council\n\nThe government has prepared a National Agricultural Innovation and Growth Action Plan, which aims to raise farmers’ incomes, boost production and steer reforms in the right direction.\n\nChairing a meeting in Islamabad recently on agricultural sector reforms, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif emphasised that the introduction of sustainable reforms in agriculture would not only boost the country’s economic development but also significantly enhance per-acre yield and reduce production costs.\n\nThe food minister informed the visiting FAO official that Pakistan is committed to revitalising the agriculture and livestock sectors to ensure food security and enhance value-added exports. He emphasised the government’s interest in mobilising foreign investment and appreciated FAO’s willingness to support such initiatives under the new work plan.\n\nMr Tiensin highlighted the immense potential of Pakistan’s livestock sector and acknowledged the government’s efforts to bring transformation in disease control, food safety and export readiness.\n\nThe food minister informed the FAO delegation about the recent establishment of the National Agri-Trade and Food Safety Authority (NAFSA), insisting that Pakistan intends to model this authority on Egypt’s successful institutional framework.\n\nHe said Pakistan will send a technical delegation to Egypt to study the institutional mechanisms and best practices adopted there.\n\nMr Tanveer also emphasised the need to revive Pakistan’s agriculture minister’s representation at FAO, which has been vacant since 2017. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to strengthening its partnership with FAO and reiterated that sustainable agriculture, livestock development and food security remain top priorities for Pakistan.\n\nDiscussions revolved around FAO’s longstanding partnership with Pakistan, which dates back to 1947 and now includes projects in 94 districts across the country. The minister appreciated FAO’s extensive contributions, particularly in strengthening agriculture through the provision of global best practices, technical expertise and policy support.\n\nHe welcomed FAO’s newly approved ‘Global Work Plan’ developed in consultation with 194 member states and expressed Pakistan’s strong interest in participating in its implementation.\n\nThe minister appreciated the role of Pakistan’s permanent representative to FAO in strengthening diplomatic engagement. It was also noted that during the Covid-19 pandemic, FAO mobilised $20 million to support Pakistan in bolstering its animal health systems and disease response capabilities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
