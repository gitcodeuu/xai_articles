The militarised distribution sites of the US and Israel-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), meanwhile, have become killing fields for Palestinian aid seekers.\n\nThe UN has refused to work with the GHF over humanitarian violations, and even Doctors Without Bor­ders minced no words when it came to the new aid delivery system.\n\n“These food distributions are not humanitarian aid; they are war crimes committed in broad daylight and presented to the world with compassionate language,” Moham­med Abu Mughaisib, MSF deputy medical coordinator in Gaza, said in the statement.\n\nIsraeli military actions blamed\n\nThe analysis found that at least 44 of the 156 incidents where aid supplies were reported stolen or lost were either directly or indirectly due to Israeli military actions.\n\nAsked about the USAID report, the Israeli military told Reuters that its allegations are based on intelligence reports that Hamas militants seized cargoes by “both covertly and overtly” embedding themselves on aid trucks.\n\nBut Hamas denies the allegatio­ns; an official said that Israel has killed more than 800 police and security guards trying to protect aid vehicles and convoy routes, whose missions were coordinated with the UN.\n\nThe 156 reports of theft or losses of supplies reviewed by BHA were filed by UN agencies and other hum­anitarian groups working in Gaza as a condition of receiving US aid funds.\n\nA second source familiar with the matter said that after receiving reports of US-funded aid thefts or losses, USAID staff followed up with partner organizations to try to determine if there was Hamas involvement.\n\nThose organizations also would “redirect or pause” aid distributions if they learned that Hamas was in the vicinity, the source said.\n\nAid organizations working in Gaza also are required to vet their personnel, sub-contractors and suppliers for ties to extremist groups before receiving US funds, a condition that the State Department waived in approving $30 million for GHF last month.\n\nOf the 156 incidents of loss or theft reported, 63 were attributed to unknown perpetrators, 35 to armed actors, 25 to unarmed people, 11 directly to Israeli military action, 11 to corrupt subcontractors, five to aid group personnel engaging in corrupt activities, and six to others,“ a category that accounted for commodities stolen in unknown circumstances, according to the slide presentation.\n\nThe armed actors included gangs and other miscellaneous individuals who may have had weapons, said a slide. Another slide said “a review of all 156 incidents found no affiliations with” US-designated foreign terrorist organizations.\n\nLosses indirectly attributed to Israeli military included cases where they compelled aid groups to use delivery routes with high risks of theft or looting, ignoring requests for alternative routes, the analysis said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
