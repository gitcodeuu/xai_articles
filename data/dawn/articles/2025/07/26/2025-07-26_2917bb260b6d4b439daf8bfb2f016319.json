  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Expressing concern over the slackness of police in apprehending illegal Afghan nationals residing or working in the Rawalpindi district, the City Police Officer (CPO) has directed the superintendents of Rawal, Potohar and Saddar divisions to launch a crackdown against illegal Afghan nationals in line with the government policy.\n\nFollowing the CPO’s orders, all station house officers (SHOs) have been instructed to detain Afghan nationals residing or working in their respective jurisdictions who have no legal proof of stay.\n\nSuch individuals are to be shifted to the holding centre at Government Associate College to ensure their repatriation to their home country.\n\nThe CPO also categorised those to be arrested as Afghan Citizen Card (ACC) holders, visa overstayers, individuals with no legal proof of stay in Pakistan and UNHCR token holders.\n\nIn this regard, the CPO expressed his displeasure over the performance of all SHOs and directed them to utilise all available resources to apprehend illegal Afghan nationals, and to submit daily reports directly to his office.\n\nMeanwhile, police have continued search operations in various parts of the district, verifying the identities of residents, particularly those living in rented accommodations.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
