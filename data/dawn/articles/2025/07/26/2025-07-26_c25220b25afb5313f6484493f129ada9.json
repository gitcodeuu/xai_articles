He revealed that 20 trained and expert judges are already available in the judiciary for this purpose.\n\nHe announced that one district from each high court’s jurisdiction will be selected to implement this arbitration mandate. Progress will be reviewed after three months, and if successful, the model will be expanded to other districts.\n\nEthical guidelines for AI use\n\nThe CJP recalled how NJPMC discussed on ethical guidelines for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nUndoubtedly given the rise of AI and its benefits, it is our top priority to integrate the concept into the justice delivery system, he said.\n\nHe added the the Supreme Court was in contact with the Supreme Court of Peoples Republic of China and that of the Constitutional Court of Turkiye to enter into memorandum of understanding for judicial cooperation for a period of five years.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
