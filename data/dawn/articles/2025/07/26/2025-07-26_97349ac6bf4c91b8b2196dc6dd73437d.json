  "content": "LAHORE: In an apparent case of domestic violence, a married woman was allegedly subjected to brutal torture by her in-laws in Shafiqabad area here on Friday after her parents failed to arrange the money being demanded by them.\n\nThe badly injured woman, Sana Javed, was rushed to a hospital after her husband and father-in-law allegedly subjected her to brutal torture.\n\nAccording to initial police reports, the suspects first used fists and kicks to punish Sana for failing to bring a hefty amount her in-laws had demanded from her parents. They later grabbed her by the hair, thrashed her and then hit her head against a concrete wall, leaving her in a pool of blood.\n\nIn a video clip surfacing on social media, the woman, apparently in severe pain, can be seen crying for help and narrating her plight after being tortured by her husband Anwar Mahmood and father-in-law Ghulam Hussain.\n\nThe woman suffered multiple deep head injuries, as evident from the video clip, showing her face rendered black and blue, while she was bleeding profusely.\n\nShe told the police that her greedy in-laws had been forcing her to bring money from her parents. On the day of the incident, the suspects attacked her when she refused to further accept their unjustified demands.\n\nThe police registered a case against the two suspects on the complaint of Sana’s uncle Sohail.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
