  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Federal Ministry of National Food Security on Friday sought to become a party in the post-arrest bail proceedings of Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) Chairman Dr Ghulam Muhammad Ali — a rarity in bail matters and a move that was met with sharp resistance from the defence counsel.\n\nJustice Muhammad Asif of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) presided over the hearing where the ministry’s legal adviser, Imran Haider Sial, appeared in person and requested the court to formally include the ministry as a party in the bail application.\n\nMr Sial argued that, as the complainant in the case, the ministry was never issued notice of the proceedings and should, therefore, be granted the right to present its position.\n\nThe petitioner’s lawyer, Noman Paracha, objected to the ministry’s request, terming it “unprecedented and unnecessary” in the context of bail hearings, where the prosecution already represents the state.\n\n“This could set a troubling precedent. Bail proceedings are between the accused and the state — not the complainant ministry,” he argued.\n\nAssistant Attorney General Shaista Tabassum, representing the federal government, requested a short adjournment to study the voluminous case record and did not take a position on the ministry’s request.\n\nThe court accepted the federation’s plea and adjourned the hearing till July 29 without a ruling on the ministry’s application.\n\nIt is worth noting that Minister for National Food Security Rana Tanveer Hussain is also a member of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) for the appointment of additional judges in the Islamabad judiciary.\n\nThe development comes days after the court of Special Judge Central, Shahrukh Arjumand, rejected Dr Ghulam Muhammad Ali’s post-arrest bail in the same case, which revolves around allegations of illegal appointments in PARC.\n\nThe FIA prosecutor informed the trial court that the case had been initiated on the instructions of the Public Accounts Committee (PAC). He claimed that although 164 posts were advertised, 332 individuals were appointed — 70 of whom were allegedly directly linked to the chairman, other PARC officials, or council members.\n\nThe FIA also alleged that many of the appointees hailed from the chairman’s home district and were hired without merit.\n\nFollowing arguments from both sides, the trial court had reserved its verdict and subsequently rejected the bail plea earlier this week.\n\nFurther hearing in the matter was adjourned till July 29.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 26th, 2025",
