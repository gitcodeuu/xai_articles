However, the cops present at the police station bravely thwarted the attack.”\n\nTerming the attack “cowardly”, he added that all the police personnel present at the station were safe.\n\n“Station House Officer (SHO) Asmatullah Khan Niazi led the operation, and the collective and timely response of the police team forced the terrorists to flee,” said Khan.\n\nRegional Police Officer Sajjad Khan and District Police Officer Saleem Abbasi commended the Basia Khel police station personnel for “braving the situation and responding promptly to protect the police station and their colleagues from harm”, the statement said.\n\nPakistan has witnessed a surge in terrorist attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan, predominantly targeting the police, law enforcement agencies’ personnel, and security forces.\n\nAttacks increased after the proscribed Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) broke a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.\n\nOver the past few months, multiple areas of KP — including Bannu, Peshawar, Karak, Lakki Marwat and Bajaur — have seen a series of attacks, particularly targeting police personnel in Bannu this month.\n\nOn Thursday, a Frontier Corps (FC) constable was killed and two others were injured when terrorists attacked their vehicle in the Daryoba area of Bannu.\n\nSix Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel were also injured on Wednesday in a “terrorist attack” at a checkpoint in Bannu, according to a police spokesperson.\n\nOn Monday, a police official identified as Constable Hayatullah was martyred when terrorists attacked him in the district while he was returning home from duty.\n\nOn July 21, over a dozen terrorists attacked a police station in the Bakkakhel town of Bannu. However, the cops responded effectively and thwarted their nefarious plan to take over the building. The police also thwarted a sabotage bid by defusing explosives in the Ghoriwala town of Bannu. An official said the explosives were seized during an intelligence-based operation in the area.\n\nOn July 19, two police officials, including an officer, were injured when terrorists carried out a quadcopter attack on Bannu’s Miryan police station.",
