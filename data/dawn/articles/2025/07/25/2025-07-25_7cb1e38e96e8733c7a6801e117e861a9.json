Images showed a huge plume of white smoke over the town, where several children were among the injured.\n\nKurdish demand rejected\n\nSyria has rejected Kurdish demands to keep their weapons, a government source said on Thursday, as a new round of talks on the Kurds’ integration into the state was set to begin.\n\nThe Kurds, who control large swathes of the north and east, are negotiating with the central government on the integration of their civil and military institutions into the state.\n\nThose include the US-backed Syrian Demo­cratic Forces (SDF), which is Kurdish-led.\n\n“Talking about refusing to hand over weapons or maintaining an autonomous military force is completely unacceptable,” the source told the state bro­adcaster Al-Ikh­bariya.\n\nAccording to the source, such a position “contradicts the principles of unifying the national army and the agreement reached last March between Ahmed al-Sharaa and Mazloum Abdi”.\n\nIn March, Interim President Ahmed al-Sharaa and SDF commander Mazloum Abdi signed a deal to incorporate Kurdish institutions into the Syrian state.\n\nWhile talks have been held regularly since then, progress has stalled.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
