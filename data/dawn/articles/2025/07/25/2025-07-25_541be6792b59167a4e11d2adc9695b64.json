  "content": "RAWALPINDI: Following heavy rains, a surge in dengue-affected patients at Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital (RTH) Raja Bazaar has prompted the district administration to make efforts to curb the spread of the deadly dengue virus.\n\nDistrict Health Authority officials confirmed a total of 17 dengue cases in Rawalpindi, with only one patient admitted to Rawalpindi Teaching Hospital, while the remaining 16 patients were discharged after treatment.\n\nThe patient arrived from Adiala road, and doctors reported that the patient’s condition is stable. However, they mentioned that the patient had travelled from Rawalpindi to Murree and may have contracted the virus there.\n\nExpressing concern over the spread of dengue, Deputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema issued a warning and urged residents to remain alert, take preventive measures, recognise their responsibilities, and adopt a serious approach towards dengue control. He conveyed this during a meeting held in his office on Thursday.\n\nHe instructed the assistant commissioners to oversee the efforts of the District Health Authority and other departments to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nHe added that the number of dengue cases has been gradually rising in Rawalpindi this week and will continue to increase if preventive steps are not implemented.\n\nHe explained that the health department has established an integrated dengue control system, with sweeping operations in the affected areas and homes where dengue patients are reported to eliminate larvae and mosquitoes.\n\nMeanwhile, after the rains, puddles have formed on main roads, causing concern for the district health authority about resuming fumigation in sensitive union councils, as dengue mosquitoes tend to emerge in areas where rainwater accumulates.\n\nIn response, the district administration has directed the district health authority and cantonment boards to activate teams to drain rainwater from their respective areas.\n\nHealth experts noted that the cooler weather following the rain creates suitable conditions for dengue mosquitoes to thrive.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
