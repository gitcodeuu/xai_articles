We don’t know what kinds of videos they found on his phone. It’s up to the police to investigate the matter,” he said.\n\nASP Daniyal also told Dawn.com that the suspect had previously been booked for rape, but the case was later dismissed.\n\nAccording to the first information report (FIR) of the 2020 case, seen by Dawn.com, the suspect had allegedly raped a widow and was booked under Section 452 (House-trespass after preparation for hurt, assault or wrongful restraint), Section 354 (Assault or criminal force to a woman with intent to outrage her modesty), and Section 34 (Acts done by several persons) of the PPC.\n\nHowever, he had reconciled with the victim, so the case was withdrawn and he was reinstated, per the ASP.\n\nMeanwhile, residents have urged Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz to take serious notice of such incidents in government hospitals.\n\nIn March, Swabi police arrested a TikToker for making videos and photos of women and girls while they were shopping and uploading them to his account.\n\nA similar incident occurred in Khanewal in December, where a suspect allegedly filmed women customers in the changing rooms of a garment retailer in Khanewal with his mobile phone. He was later sent on judicial remand.\n\nLast June, police lodged a case against the owners and staff of a private girls’ hostel in Lahore’s Johar Town for recording videos of the residents through hidden cameras installed in washrooms, causing apprehensions that these clips may be sold and used on the ‘dark web’ or social media.",
