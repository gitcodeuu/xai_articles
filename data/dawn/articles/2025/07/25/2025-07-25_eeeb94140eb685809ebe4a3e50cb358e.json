A total of 1,204 cases were of abduction and 241 cases of missing children.\n\nThe report Cruel Numbers 2024 by Sahil was prepared based on data collected from 81 national and regional newspapers across the country.\n\n“The objective of the report is to present the data on the situation regarding violence against children (up to 18 years) in cases of sexual abuse, abduction/kidnapping, missing children, and child marriages,” the report stated.",
