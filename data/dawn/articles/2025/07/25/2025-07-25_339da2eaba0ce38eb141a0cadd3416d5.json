We will now consider alternative options to bring the [prisoners] home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza,” US envoy Steve Witkoff said in a statement on X.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the latest draft proposed by Hamas calls for a return to protocol agreed on Jan 19 to allow aid entry to Gaza, seeks return to old mechanism of its distribution, and includes modified maps for Israeli military deployment in the strip.\n\nEuropean ‘emergency call’\n\nUK PM Keir Starmer has offered an uncharacteristically sympathetic account of the situation in Gaza, terming the starvation unfolding in the besieged enclave a “unspeakable and indefensible” humanitarian catastrophe, while calling on Israel to urgently allow in aid.\n\nWhile the situation has been grave for some time, it has rea­ched new depths and continues to worsen, he said in a statement.\n\n“I will hold an emergency call with E3 partners tomorrow, where we will discuss what we can do urgently to stop the killing and get people the food they desperately need while pulling toge­ther all the steps necessary to build a lasting peace.”\n\nUN unable to verify aid\n\nMeanwhile, two different arms of the United Nations expressed frustration over Israel’s continued denial of access for aid to Gaza.\n\nThe UNRWA has “the equivalent of 6,000 loaded trucks of food and medical supplies” waiting in Jordan and Egypt, its commissioner Philippe Laz­za­ri­­ni said on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, UN-OCHA spok­esp­er­son Jens Laerke maintai­ned that des­pite repeated req­uests, Israel has not allowed its staff to be present at the crossings.\n\nLaerke explained that the UN needed multiple approvals from the Israeli authorities: firstly to get aid across the border from Israel into the Gaza Strip, where it is dropped off — the trucks returning to Israel — followed by another approval to drive trucks from inside Gaza to collect it.\n\n“We therefore cannot verify the amount of supplies curren­tly at the crossing,” he told AFP.\n\nAccording to the health ministry in Gaza, of the 113 people who died from malnutrition since October 2023, 81 were children and 32 were adults, BBC News reported.\n\nAid groups say there is no shortage in the supply of food, but Israel is obstructing it and making it virtually impossible for humanitarian assistance to reach millions of people who desperately need it.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
