  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Thursday directed the concerned officials to expedite the feasibility report for introducing a tram service on various routes in Islamabad.\n\nThe directives were issued by CDA Chairman Mohammad Ali Randhawa during a meeting where board members and officials from the National Radio Telecommunication Corporation (NRTC) discussed the proposal.\n\nAccording to an official handout, the participants held a detailed discussion regarding introducing a state-of-the-art transport system for the citizens.\n\nIt was decided that electric tram buses would be introduced in Islamabad, ensuring citizens have access to advanced transport solutions.\n\nThe proposed trams would feature multiple compartments to accommodate more passengers and would be designed to be accessible for differently-abled individuals and women.\n\nDigital screens to be installed at bus terminals displaying schedules, safety guidelines\n\nDuring the briefing, the participants were informed that a feasibility report covering financial, operational and business models was being prepared. They were told that the electric bus project had already exceeded a daily ridership of 90,000 passengers as these buses were eco-friendly, cost-effective and punctual, attracting appreciation from the citizens.\n\nMr Randhawa said that provision of modern and efficient transport facilities to the residents of the capital was CDA’s top priority.\n\nHe instructed the concerned officers to finalise the feasibility report, particularly focusing on financial sustainability.\n\nHe emphasised developing a self-sustaining financial model and exploring public-private partnerships.\n\nClear timelines and operational goals for the tram project were also decided in the meeting.\n\nRegarding the electric feeder buses, the CDA chairman ordered the installation of modern digital screens at terminals displaying advertisements, schedules and safety guidelines.\n\n“To enhance revenue, smart ticketing systems and in-bus advertisements will be introduced. Additionally, electric buses will also be allocated for the CDA employees,” it said.\n\nThe participants of the meeting were informed that 140 bus stops were being upgraded with over 200 new stops to be constructed, featuring digital boards for non-fare revenue generation.\n\nMeanwhile, sources in the CDA told Dawn that after completion of the feasibility study, the civic agency would explore options for procurement of trams - most likely from China.\n\nAccording to them, the CDA wanted to start tram service initially on four routes, including Rawat to Faisal Mosque on the Expressway and Jinnah Square to the Islamabad International Airport on Srinagar Highway.\n\nIn the past too, the CDA had made such claims to start tram and light train services, but failed to translate the plans into reality.\n\nThe CDA through its contractor NRTC has already been running an electric bus service in Islamabad for the last over one year.\n\nThe bus service is providing transport facility to thousands of people. However, several steps are yet to be taken to facilitate passengers regarding information about the arrival and departure time of the buses.\n\nPresently, there are no digital screens or any other source of information in Islamabad to guide the commuters about the timing of the buses at various stops like in other countries.\n\nAccording to CDA officials, a mobile app has already been developed and available on Google Play Store for this purpose.\n\nHowever, they admitted the fact that merely the app was not sufficient to provide such information many poor people who mostly use the public transport do not have smart phones or access to the internet.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
