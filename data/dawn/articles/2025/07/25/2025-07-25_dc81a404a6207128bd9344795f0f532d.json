  "content": "LONDON: Former leftist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn announced on Thursday he was forming a new political party alongside another ex-member of Britain’s ruling party, as the UK’s political landscape continues to splinter.\n\nCorbyn, who lost two elections as Labour leader in 2017 and 2019, and fellow independent MP Zarah Sultana referred to the new left-wing outfit as “Your Party”, but later said its name still had to be decided.\n\n“It’s time for a new kind of political party. One that is rooted in our communities, trade unions and social movements,” they said in a joint statement. In their announcement, they called for a “mass redistribution of wealth and power” and said they would “keep demanding an end to all arms sales to Israel”. They also committed to a “free and independent Palestine”.\n\nPrime Minister Keir Starmer, who has pulled Labour to the centre since succeeding Corbyn as leader, faces growing calls within his party to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\nCorbyn, 76, stepped down as Labour leader after overseeing its worst result in decades, when it was trounced in the 2019 general election by the Conservatives, then led by Boris Johnson.\n\nLabour under Starmer suspended him in 2020 after he refused to fully accept the findings of a rights watchdog’s probe into claims that anti-Semitism had become rampant within Labour’s ranks under his leadership.\n\nThe Equality and Human Rights Commission ruled the party had broken equality law when Corbyn was in charge. Corbyn said anti-Semitism had been “dramatically overstated for political reasons”.\n\nLast year, Corbyn announced he would stand as an independent in the July 2024 general election after Labour failed to put him forward as a candidate. He was expelled from the party but still went on to win comfortably his Islington North seat in London, which he has represented for more than 40 years.\n\nSultana, an MP since 2019, was suspended by Labour last year after she and several other members of parliament voted to scrap a controversial cap on child benefits.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
