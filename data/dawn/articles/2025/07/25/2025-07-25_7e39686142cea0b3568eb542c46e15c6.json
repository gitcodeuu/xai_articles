All sentences will run concurrently.\n\nIn the detailed order released on Thursday, the judge stated the four convicted senior leaders of PTI were exonerated of the charges of waging or conspiring to wage war against the country.\n\nThe judge observed most of the convicts, including Dr Rashid, Senator Chaudhry and Mr Rashid, didn’t dispute their presence at the site where the violence took place but claimed not to have committed any violence.\n\nHowever, the prosecution produced video recordings in which the convicts were visible at the site of violence along with a mob. The defence did not challenge this evidence, the verdict added.\n\nThe judge said the record indicated the mob, armed with sticks, stones and petrol bombs, committed several acts of violence and rioting.\n\nOn the convicts’ role in violence, the judge noted once the hatching of a criminal conspiracy was established, it was not necessary for every person part of the mob to have committed violence.\n\nOn the charge of criminal conspiracy, the judge relied on the prosecution’s evidence, wherein two witnesses, who were police officials, claimed to have secretly attended PTI meetings.\n\nIn these meetings, the witnesses said, PTI Imran Khan instructed other leaders to attack military installations in case of his arrest from the Islamabad High Court.\n\nThese meetings were held at Mr Khan’s Zaman Park residence on May 7, 8 and 9, 2023.\n\nThe judge said both witnesses sufficiently described the conspiracy meetings in their statements and the defence failed to “create any plausible dent or doubt” in respect to the charge of conspiracy.\n\nThe judge maintained the conspiracy was further corroborated by a chain of events that took place soon after the arrest of Mr Khan.\n\n“It is now an open secret that fateful incidents of 9th May 2023 took place all over the country and the modus operandi of the miscreants was to target military installations and law enforcement agencies,” the judge noted.\n\nQureshi’s acquittal\n\nOn the acquittal of PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi and five other suspects in the case, the judge observed Mr Qureshi successfully proved his presence in Karachi and Islamabad on the day of violence.\n\nMoreover, Mr Qureshi had attended only one meeting on May 7 and was not involved in any violence that took place as per the instructions given in the meetings. Tuesday’s verdict was the first decision in any of the cases related to May 9 riots in Lahore.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
