I will make a formal announcement at the United Nations General Assembly in September,” the French head of state wrote on X and Instagram.\n\nIncluding France, Palestinian statehood is now recognised by 142 countries, though Israel and the United States strongly oppose recognition.\n\nFrance would be the most significant European power to recognise a Palestinian state.\n\n“The urgent priority today is to end the war in Gaza and rescue the civilian population,” Macron wrote.\n\n“We must finally build the state of Palestine, ensure its viability and enable it, by accepting its demilitarisation and fully recognising Israel, to contribute to the security of all in the Middle East.”\n\nPA welcomes intent\n\nPalestinian Authority President Mahmud Abbas’s deputy, Hussein al Sheikh, welcomed France’s intent to recognise the state of Palestine, thanking President Macron.\n\n“This position reflects France’s commitment to international law and its support for the Palestinian people’s right to self-determination and the establishment of our independent state,” Sheikh said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
