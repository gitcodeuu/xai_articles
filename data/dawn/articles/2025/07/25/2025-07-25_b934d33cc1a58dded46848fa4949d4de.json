  "content": "KARACHI: The annual security survey conducted by the Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) for the period June 2024 to May 2025 has reported a measurable improvement in the overall security environment, particularly in the business hubs of Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad. However, a fragile security situation in Balochistan continues to undermine investor confidence.\n\nThe survey, based on feedback from leading foreign investors operating across Pakistan, found that over 70pc of respondents observed a noticeable decline in serious crimes in Karachi, Lahore, and throughout Punjab. Street crimes were also reported to have dropped significantly. Additionally, two-thirds of respondents said their employees felt safer during daily commutes, particularly in these three cities.\n\nDespite these gains, the report highlighted ongoing security challenges in certain sensitive areas. While a moderate reduction in street crimes was noted in Quetta and Peshawar, both cities continue to be perceived as the least secure in terms of personal safety.\n\nMost notably, Balochistan witnessed a deterioration in serious crimes compared to the previous year, reversing the positive trend seen in other provinces. The divergence underscores persistent concerns that, although perceptions have improved in major urban centres, the security situation in regions like Balochistan continues to tarnish Pakistan’s global image and hinder long-term investor confidence.\n\nSituation remains fragile in Balochistan, OICCI notes\n\nThe survey also revealed that security remains among the top three concerns for chief executives of foreign firms, indicating that sustained and inclusive improvements are crucial to bolstering business sentiment.\n\nCommenting on the findings, OICCI Secretary General M. Abdul Aleem said the 2025 survey reflects a “cautiously optimistic outlook,” with clear progress in Karachi and Lahore serving as a positive signal for investors.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
