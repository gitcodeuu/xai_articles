Also present were Karachi’s Mayor Murtaza Wahab, Special Assistant to the CM Saleem Baloch, Principal Secretary to the CM Agha Wasif, Planning and Development Chairman Najam Shah, Secretary of Local Government Waseem Shamshad, and others.\n\nThe WB delegation, led by Regional Vice President for the Middle East, North Africa, Afghanistan, and Pakistan (Menaap) Ousmane Dione, included Country Director Bolormaa Amgaabazar, Special Assistant to Regional Vice President Lobna Hadji, Regional Practice Director Faida M. Saadah, and Regional Practice Director Almud Weitz, among others.\n\nThe WB is currently supporting Sindh in a broad range of sectors, including Sindh people’s housing for flood-affected people, education, health, agriculture, rural water, sanitation and hygiene, Karachi urban infrastructure, energy, social protection, and post-flood reconstruction.\n\nThe CM emphasised the provincial government’s development priorities, particularly in sanitation, health, education, energy, and investment in human capital.\n\nDespite the productive collaboration, Shah also flagged several challenges requiring urgent attention.\n\nHe noted the absence of a dedicated WB procurement specialist in Karachi following the untimely passing of Uzma Sadaf, who had provided critical support during project evaluations.\n\nHe said that this vacuum had led to significant delays and disruptions in procurement and evaluation processes, urging the bank to station a qualified procurement expert in Karachi to streamline project implementation.\n\nIn 2022, Sindh experienced devastating floods that affected over 12.36m people, damaged 2.1m houses and resulted in 1,100 deaths. The floods also caused extensive destruction to schools, roads, agriculture, and livestock.\n\nIn response, the WB and international partners committed to rehabilitation efforts, facilitating the construction of resilient housing, with validations for 2m of the planned 2.1m houses completed. Over 1.3m bank accounts have been opened for aid, and 600,000 houses have already been built.\n\nThe initiative promotes gender inclusivity, with 300,000 land titles awarded to women, and has created over a million jobs for those affected. As recovery continues, the collaboration between the government and international partners is vital for rebuilding communities and restoring livelihoods.\n\nThe chief minister, discussing the safely-managed water, sanitation and hygiene (Wash) project, announced a targeted, technology-led plan to serve rural communities based on local water availability and climate conditions.\n\n“Each village deserves a solution tailored to its geography,” the CM said. “This strategy ensures sustainability, equity, and resilience.”\n\nAccording to Shah, the findings show that 48pc villages can access groundwater sources, 38pc are near surface water (within 2,000 feet of canals), 23pc are close to left bank and right bank outflood drains, and 14pc still need a viable water solution.\n\nThe CM said that to bridge this gap, the province was divided into six WASH zones, including coastal, arid, agricultural, and flood-prone areas. He added that solutions were being designed using drone surveys, AI mapping, and geo-tagging, with support from partners.\n\nThe CM also said that a robust monitoring, operation and maintenance system was being developed, along with the reuse of treated wastewater for mini forests and livelihood initiatives.\n\n“This is more than infrastructure,” he said. “It’s about creating climate-resilient, dignified living for every household in Sindh.”\n\nHighlighting the importance of modern urban transport infrastructure, the CM reiterated his government’s request for additional financing of over $170m for the Karachi Urban Mobility Project (Kump). The WB has so far committed only $86m, falling short of the required funds to realise the project’s scope fully.\n\nCM Shah also urged the bank to expedite the approval of the project operations manual for phase two of the Karachi Water and Sewerage Services Improvement Project (KWSSIP-II), saying that this is the only condition remaining for loan effectiveness.\n\nHe called on both the WB and project management to ensure completion before the deadline of August 21 2025, warning against any further extensions.\n\nUnder the Sindh Early Learning Enhancement through Classroom Transformation (Select) project, all school construction contracts have been signed. However, due to implementation delays, they cannot be completed by the original loan closing date of April 30, 2026.\n\nThe CM requested a one-year extension until April 2027 to ensure successful completion. The WB delegation agreed to extend the project after meeting the required formalities.\n\nMeanwhile, he also talked about the the Strengthening Social Protection Delivery Systems in Sindh project, which is progressing well and now includes seven additional districts, is currently set to close in December 2027. Given the scale and recent momentum, the CM requested a one-year extension to fully realise project objectives.\n\nThe chief minister emphasised that Sindh remains committed to enhancing institutional capacity and transparency in project implementation. He thanked the WB for its continued support, and called for sustained collaboration and faster decision-making to ensure the timely delivery of critical development interventions across the province.\n\nThe WB delegation acknowledged the issues raised and assured the CM of their commitment to addressing the challenges and advancing mutual development priorities.\n\nYesterday, PM Shehbaz Sharif met with the WB delegation in Islamabad, appreciating the World Bank’s (WB) support for Pakistan’s position in light of India’s suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT).\n\nThe prime minister also thanked the WB for its generous assistance during the 2022 floods, and especially thanked WB President Ajay Banga and former country director for Pakistan Najy Benhassine for their pivotal role in advancing the new CPF for Pakistan.",
