  "content": "KHYBER: Customs authorities started clearance of hundreds of stranded vehicles loaded with imported coal and soapstone after grant of an interim relief to local importers of the two minerals by Peshawar High Court.\n\nLocal coal importers told this scribe that 1,800 to 2,000 loaded trucks stranded on both sides of Torkham border in Khyber and Kharlaachi border in Kurram would benefit from the interim relief of PHC.\n\nThey said that as soon as the short order was issued by PHC and its copy was shown to customs authorities at Torkham, the clearing process was started.\n\nHundreds of importers and the transporters had been battling the ban on import of coal and soapstone till the production of country of origin certificate (COC) by the importer at the time of customs clearance at any border point.\n\nSources said that a group of coal and soapstone importers had in the meantime approached PHC for a stay against the newly-imposed condition of COC for import of the two minerals from Afghanistan while pleading for a reversal of the previous procedure of customs clearance without production of COC.\n\nPHC has granted interim relief to importers of coal and soapstone\n\nImporters in Torkham said that 700 to 800 loaded vehicles had already crossed Torkham and Kharlaachi borders about three weeks ago while another 1,000 were stopped on Afghan side after the new condition was imposed.\n\nCustoms authorities both at Torkham and Kharlaachi had demanded of coal and soapstone importers to explicitly mention names of the importer and exporter along with the actual weight and value of the consignment in a particular vehicle.\n\nLocal importers had been arguing before the customs authorities that they had no issue in including their actual names as importers and exporters, but there were some technical issues pertaining to mentioning the actual weight and value of both minerals due to difference in the process of customs clearance and valuation in Kabul and Pakistan side of the border.\n\nCoal and soapstone importers had a few days ago requested customs authorities in Torkham to allow the stranded vehicles on Pakistan side of the border to return to Afghanistan as they had incurred huge financial losses.\n\nMeanwhile, National Logistic Corporation (NLC) has doubled its terminal charges for loaded and empty vehicles of various categories, depending on the size of vehicle.\n\nIn a pamphlet distributed among transporters and also displayed at customs terminal, NLC has directed all local and Afghan transporters to deposit the newly-announced fee of the terminal with effect from August 14.\n\nAccording to the new fee structure, every 22-wheeler vehicle will deposit Rs17,000 while 10 and eight wheelers will be charged Rs14,000. Similarly, four-wheeler loaded vehicle and all empty vehicles will be charged Rs11,000 and Rs5,000 respectively.\n\nTransporters termed the new fee structure unjust and said that they were already burdened with different types of inflated taxes at the time of their goods clearance and their onward journey to most cities of Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
