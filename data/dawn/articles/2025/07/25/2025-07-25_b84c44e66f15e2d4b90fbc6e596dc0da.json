Authorities are providing all possible assistance to those affected,” the premier added.\n\nRajasthan state education minister Madan Dilawar announced that there would be a probe into the cause of the “very unfortunate” incident.\n\n“I will get a high-level inquiry done today to find out why this incident happened,” Dilawar said in a statement.\n\nHe added that local authorities were making “arrangements for the treatment” of the injured students.\n\nGovernment schools in India face chronic funding shortages, with students complaining of absent teachers, dilapidated buildings, and a lack of basic amenities like clean drinking water or toilets.\n\nThe situation has improved in urban areas in recent years but the pace of change in rural India still remains slow.\n\nEarlier today, local media had reported that at least four children had been killed and 17 were injured, with dozens still feared trapped under the rubble.\n\nA local police officer, who declined to be named, told Reuters the school building was old and the roof might have fallen in as a result of heavy rainfall in the region.\n\n“There were 25-30 children in the room when the roof fell after the morning prayers,” Rajasthan education minister, Madan Dilawar, told AajTak news channel.\n\nVisuals from news channels showed locals gathered around the site of the collapse. Distressed family members could be heard crying as authorities used a crane to remove the debris.\n\nLocal media reported that 32 students had been pulled out safely, but rescue operations were ongoing.\n\n“Instructions have been given to the concerned authorities to ensure proper treatment for the injured children,” Rajasthan Chief Minister Bhajanlal Sharma said on X.\n\nSome of the injured children were critical, local police officer Amit Kumar told the PTI news agency, according to the Economic Times newspaper.",
