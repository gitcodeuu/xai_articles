But the latest Finance Bill provided multiple safeguards to avoid harassment of businessmen and taxpayers.\n\nThe committee held an extensive discussion on several anomalies in the Budget 2025–26, including briefings from members of the chambers of commerce, with a specific focus on clauses granting powers of arrest to the FBR on the basis of mere suspicion.\n\nState Minister for Finance and Revenue Bilal Azhar Kiyani said the prime minister had constituted a committee to redress the grievances of the chambers.\n\nMoreover, a review and redressal committee had also been constituted for a periodic review of the business community’s issues.\n\nMr Kiyani said a circular would be issued soon to clarify the lacunae highlighted by the chambers, following detailed discussions with business community.\n\nSenator Saleem Mandviwalla, who chaired the meeting, and the other members agreed with the state minister that it would not be good optics to seek amendments to the finance bill just a month after its passage, with the consent of the International Monetary Fund .\n\nAnother FBR member, Dr Najeeb, said the government had diluted the taxpayers powers following pushback from coalition partners, parliamentarians and others and there had been a lot of difference between the finance bill originally introduced in the parliament and later passed by the parliament.\n\nHe said conceded that the extensive deliberations over the finance bill with the standing committees of the National Assembly and the Senate did not leave them enough time for the usual anomaly committees to address all concerns, leaving some room for misunderstandings.\n\nHowever, he maintained that the “element of fear” was being unnecessarily overblown.\n\nWhile discussing software exports over the last 15 years, the committee recommended the State Bank of Pakistan to submit data with the clear categorisation of freelancers share in software exports.\n\nThe committee also recommended the removal of periodical and journal subscriptions from the IT services list.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
