The families made an SOS call to the District Emergency Office in Attock. Upon receiving the emergency alert, teams from Rescue 1122, equipped with life jackets, boats and other life-saving equipment, reached the site.\n\nThe rescue officials managed to safely evacuate the 40 people from the powerful current and deliver them to safety.\n\nThe rescue operation, which involved the shifting of families to safe locations, was monitored by Deputy Commissioner Atif Raza, while District Emergency Officer Ali Hussain supervised the operation.\n\nTalking to the media, Ali Hussain stated that every year, at the beginning of the monsoon season, Rescue 1122 conducts mock exercises aimed at testing operational readiness, machinery efficiency, and inter-departmental coordination.\n\nDuring these drills, rescue personnel also demonstrate the evacuation of flood-affected individuals to safe areas.\n\nHe added that the drill simulates real-life rescue operations in flood scenarios and features practical demonstrations by Rescue 1122 teams using modern equipment for flood evacuation, firefighting, and rapid response mobility.\n\nIt also includes training in CPR, bandaging and emergency care to ensure a swift response during potential disasters. Hussain concluded that the exercise proved valuable, as the rescue teams showcased their flood evacuation skills and saved 40 lives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 25th, 2025",
