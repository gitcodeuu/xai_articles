  "content": "LONDON: K. L. Rahul scored a century while Ravindra Jadeja and Rishabh Pant pitched in with crucial fifties as India posted 387 on day three, equalling England’s first innings, with their third Test hanging in the balance at Lord’s on Saturday.\n\nAn injury to Shoaib Bashir blunted England’s pace-spin attack strategy when India looked vulnerable with five wickets down after losing Pant and Rahul in quick succession, before Jadeja steadied their innings with his third fifty-plus knock in a row.\n\nEngland openers Zak Crawley and Ben Duckett, who played a single over from Jasprit Bumrah before stumps, remained unbeaten at 2-0 as the five-match series remains tied as both sides look to go 2-1 up with a win in the third Test.\n\nIndia started well from an overnight score of 145-3 as left-handed batter Pant, who scored twin centuries in the first Test, battled through an injured finger on his left hand as he hooked England captain Stokes for six to bring up his fifty.\n\nThe 27-year-old survived when an awkward hook on a short ball from Stokes almost got him caught near the fine leg boundary, but a diving Crawley could only lob the ball back inside to prevent a six.\n\nBut Pant was run out for 74 on the last ball before lunch as he tried to take a quick single after playing Bashir towards cover point, where Stokes made a quick turn to hit the stumps on the non-striker’s end with a swift, direct throw.\n\nOpener Rahul was the next to fall, edging Bashir’s flighted ball to Harry Brook in the slip on his very next ball after reaching 100, leaving India on shaky ground at 254-5 under a warm London sun.\n\nBut Bashir had to leave the ground when he injured a finger on his non-bowling left hand while attempting a low catch from his own delivery as Jadeja shot down the wicket, with commentators saying the 21-year-old might need extra treatment in the evening.\n\nJadeja and Nitish Kumar Reddy, new to the crease, looked unsteady as England’s bowlers piled on the pressure. Mix-ups between the batters put Reddy at risk of getting run out on two occasions but Ollie Pope’s direct throws missed the target both times.\n\nHowever, as England returned to using two pacers soon after Bashir’s injury, the pair put together a 72-run partnership before Stokes claimed his second wicket of the match, getting Reddy to nick it to keeper Jamie Smith for 30.\n\nJadeja drove Joe Root down long off for four to complete his half-century, while Washington Sundar took a slow, cautious approach on the other end.\n\nTheir 50-run partnership for the eighth wicket got India within 11 runs of England’s total, before Chris Woakes dismissed Jadeja for 72 as the batter’s attempt to send the ball down fine leg only took a thin edge and landed in Smith’s gloves.\n\nAkash Deep, in at number nine, was given out leg before wicket twice by umpire Sharfuddoula Saikat during the same over but Hawk-Eye showed the ball was missing the stumps when the batter reviewed them, overturning both decisions.\n\nBut Deep fell soon after to Brydon Carse for seven, with Brook trapping him at third slip with a low dive.\n\nSundar brought the scores level with a flick to the mid-wicket, before Woakes dismissed Jaspreet Bumrah for a duck in the very next ball to bag his third wicket.\n\nJofra Archer got Sundar out for 23 to bring an end to India’s innings, leaving the match finely poised going into the final two days.\n\nScoreboard\n\nENGLAND (1st Innings) 387 (J.
