Police had stated that the actor’s body would be handed over to her brother after DNA matching.\n\nSpeaking to journalists, Naveed said, “The body was in police custody. The police had kept the body for investigation before calling us (the family) to claim it.”\n\nHe said that for the last three days, the family was in contact with Chhipa and the police.\n\n“According to the guidelines, we were [eventually] going to receive the body and perform the rites,” he said.\n\nBesides being a theatre, film and TV artist, Humera was also a visual artist who studied at Punjab University’s Fine Arts Department and completed a Bachelor’s of Fine Arts in painting. During her university days, she had interaction with theatre groups such as Natak, led by Dr Ahmed Bilal, which was a university-based theatre group consisting of students.\n\nShe had interactions with Amjad Islam Amjad, Qavi Khan and other senior actors who used to visit the university for lectures. In her early years of performing art, she did about four or five Pakistan television plays. She also extensively did socially relevant and objective theatre those days.",
