  "content": "QUETTA: Iran Air plans to launch direct weekly passenger and cargo flights from Quetta to the Iranian cities of Zahidan and Mashhad in a move aimed at boosting trade and travel between the neighbouring countries, an Iranian diplomat announced on Saturday.\n\nThe new air service will help facilitate commerce, reduce travel time and costs for traders, and strengthen bilateral ties, said Ali Reza Rajai, Iran’s acting consul general in Quetta.\n\nThe announcement was made at a ceremony organised by the Pak-Iran Joint Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThe flights are intended “to facilitate trade and travel between Pakistan and Iran,” Rajai said, stressing the need for stronger cooperation.\n\nTop officials from the airline, including Iran Air Chief Agha Karimi and Deputy Chief Agha Ismail, were also in attendance.\n\nMr Rajai said the new service would be critical for enhancing port-to-port cooperation between Pakistan’s Gwadar Port and Iran’s Chabahar Port.\n\nHe called for bureaucratic hurdles to be removed to improve bilateral business, including streamlined visa processes and affordable fares.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 13th, 2025",
