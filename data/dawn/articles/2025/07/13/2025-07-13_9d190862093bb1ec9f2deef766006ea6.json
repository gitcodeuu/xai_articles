He said the government will give formal approval after getting PC-I of these projects.\n\nThere is also a plan to start work on Kutchery Chowk underpass, but there are some problems in acquiring the land. He said the government also wanted to construct a flyover in front of Jinnah Park on the old airport road. It is expected that work on the flyover and underpass on Kutchery Chowk will start simultaneously.\n\nPunjab govt has allocated funds for underpasses in ADP 2025-26\n\nThe official said after construction of the three new underpasses, Mall and Peshawar roads will be signal free from Kutchery to the Motorway Chowk.\n\nHe said the Punjab government had decided to reduce travel time on Peshawar Road by making it a signal-free corridor. The local administration has been directed to start work on a project to connect Islamabad Expressway with the motorway Chowk via Peshawar Road so commuters would get an alternative to Srinagar Highway. He said the project would also improve the condition of roads and squares in the area.\n\n“There are two routes to connect New Islamabad Airport and Motorway with Rawat and residential areas along Old Airport including Islamabad Expressway to Srinagar Highway and second is I.J.Principal Road as due to traffic congestion on Peshawar Road mostly people I.J. P. road which is relatively long,” he said.\n\nHe said that Rawalpindi Ring Road will also provide alternative route but in future, Peshawar Road will be signal free for the residents of Rawalpindi to reach New Islamabad International Airport and Motorway without any hurdle.\n\n“The provincial government is also working to launch electric buses in Rawalpindi and it will connect the public transport for airport and motorway route and signal free corridor will be beneficial in this regard also,” he said.\n\nHe said that more than 100 electric buses will ply on different routes of Rawalpindi.\n\nHe said that the road from Rawat T-Chowk to Kutchery Chowk was already signal-free. Pirwadhai Mor to Motorway Chowk is signal-free and after construction of new underpasses, the patch from Military Hospital to Pirwadhai Mor will be signal-free and movement of buses and vehicles will be easy.\n\nEarlier, Rawalpindi Development Authority was assigned to start work but later the Communication and Works Department was given the task to initiate work on GPO and the Mall underpasses.\n\nA senior official of the department told Dawn that work had been launched to prepare PC-I and in this regard a survey of the area had started. He said a consultant will be hired to make PC-I by the end of July while work was likely to start after the monsoon.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 13th, 2025",
