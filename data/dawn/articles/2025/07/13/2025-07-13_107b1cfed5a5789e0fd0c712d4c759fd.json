  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti has emphasised that human rights organisations must develop an impartial understanding of the province’s true history, current ground realities, and ongoing situation.\n\nHe stressed that much of the narrative being circulated — both nationally and internationally — about Balochistan contradicted facts and needed to be corrected to promote a balanced and truthful perspective.\n\nThe chief minister said this during a meeting with the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) delegation headed by Asad Iqbal Butt.\n\nThe delegation comprised Chairperson Munizae Jahangir, Arifa Noor, Kashif Panizai and others. They discussed law and order, human rights situation and ongoing efforts for socio-economic development in the province.\n\nThe chief minister briefed the delegation on the situation in Balochistan, highlighting challenges and his government’s approach to protecting human rights.\n\nMr Bugti said the accession of the State of Kalat to Pakistan was not by force but through mutual consent. However, he noted, some elements were “intentionally distorting history” to mislead those unfamiliar with historical facts.\n\nReferring to recent acts of terrorism, he strongly condemned the targeted killing of innocent passengers who were pulled off buses and murdered based on their identity. “This is a glaring reflection of the evil agenda of the Hindustan conspiracy,” he said.\n\nHe stressed that such terrorist acts are not a struggle for rights but part of an orchestrated campaign to destabilise and divide Pakistan. “These terrorist organisations are backed by known sponsors who have openly declared their anti-Pakistan agendas in both national and international media forums,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 13th, 2025",
