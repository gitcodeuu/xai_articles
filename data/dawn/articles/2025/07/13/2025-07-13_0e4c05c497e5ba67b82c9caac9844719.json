  "content": "WASHINGTON: The Pentagon is urging Japan and Australia to clarify what role they would play if the US and China went to war over Taiwan, the Financial Times reported on Saturday.\n\nElbridge Colby, the US under secretary of defence for policy, has been pushing the matter during recent talks with defence officials of both countries, the report said, citing people familiar with the discussions.\n\nAccording to the newspaper, the reported request caught both Tokyo and Canberra off guard, as the US itself does not offer a blank cheque guarantee to defend Taiwan.\n\nColby said in an X post that the Department of Defence is focused on implementing the president’s “America First” common sense agenda of restoring deterrence and achieving peace through strength, which “includes by urging allies to step up their defence spending and other efforts related to our collective defence.”\n\nThe US is Taiwan’s most important arms supplier, despite a lack of formal diplomatic ties. Taiwan has faced increased military pressure from China, including several rounds of war games, as Beijing seeks to assert its sovereignty claims over the island.\n\nTaiwan rejects China’s assertion of sovereignty.\n\nColby was deputy assistant secretary of defence for strategy and force development during President Donald Trump’s first term. Colby is known for arguing that the US military should prioritise competition with China and shift its focus from the Middle East and Europe.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 13th, 2025",
