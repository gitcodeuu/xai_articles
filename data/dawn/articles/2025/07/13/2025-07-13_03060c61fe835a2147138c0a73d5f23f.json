About 200 migrants were detained, and clashes erupted with protesters.\n\nOne worker being chased by ICE agents fell from the roof of a greenhouse and died on Saturday.\n\nHoman called the death “sad” but specified that the man was not in ICE custody at the time of his death.\n\nIn a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said he had watched footage of “thugs” throwing rocks and bricks at ICE vehicles, causing “tremendous damage.”\n\nTrump said he was authorising law enforcement officers who are “on the receiving end of thrown rocks, bricks, or any other form of assault, to stop their car, and arrest these slimeballs, using whatever means is necessary to do so”.\n\n“I am giving total authorisation for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the public,” he said.\n\nTrump has been involved in a showdown over immigration enforcement with Democratic-ruled California for weeks.\n\nThe Republican president sent thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles last month to quell protests against round-ups of undocumented migrants by federal agents.\n\nCalifornia Governor Gavin Newsom has said the troops were not necessary to address the mostly peaceful protests, but his legal efforts to have them removed have failed so far.\n\nThe cannabis farm in Camarillo was calm during a visit by an AFP reporter on Friday, as workers waited in line to collect their belongings and paychecks.\n\n“We’ve been here since six this morning asking questions, but they’re not giving us any information,” said Saul Munoz, a 43-year-old Colombian whose son was detained on Thursday.\n\n“I just want to know how he’s doing,” Munoz said. “Bring him back to me and if it’s time for us to leave, we’ll leave.\n\n“The truth is the American dream is no longer really the American dream.”",
