A rescue helicopter has been requested from the army.\n\nTraditionally, the main climbing season for these peaks stretches from late June to mid-August. But this year, tour operators say, the risks are unusually high.\n\n“This year, weather at the peaks are not normal,” Iqbal Qadri, a tour operator with five foreign expedition groups waiting at base camps, told Dawn.\n\n“Less snowfall was received in winter, and there are risks of rockfall and snow avalanches.”\n\nSakhawat Hussain, another tour operator, confirmed that progress on the 8,000-metre peaks has been delayed.\n\n“Even ropes have not been fixed at K2, owing to unstable conditions,” he said, adding that the lack of snow has contributed to the danger.\n\n“There are threats of rockfall at K2 and other eight-thousander peaks this year.”\n\nExperts believe shifting weather patterns, driven by climate change, have upended the climbing season.\n\nLow winter snowfall, followed by intense heat, means snow melts rapidly rather than consolidating into stable ice.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 13th, 2025",
