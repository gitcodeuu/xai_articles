Neither does it promise to include most of the “gross human rights violations” acknowledged by former president Joko Widodo in 2023.\n\nJajat Burhanudin, a project editor, contradicted Fadli and dismissed concerns, telling AFP the new volumes would include 1998 events, with the draft outline just a “trigger for discussion”.\n\nOfficials say the new historical account is needed to strengthen Indonesian identity, but warned that any omission about its darkest past will raise eyebrows over objectivity.\n\n“What is feared is that … the cases that have been accepted by the previous government to be resolved will be ignored,” said Marzuki Darusman, a former attorney general and head of a civil society coalition opposed to the volumes.\n\nWhile it remains unclear how the government plans to use the books, Jajat said the volumes could be used as “one of the main sources” for history books taught in schools.\n\nNeither historian Susanto Zuhdi, who is helming the project, nor the presidential palace responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe revisionist history garnered renewed scrutiny after the culture minister questioned whether mass rape had occurred at the end of Suharto’s rule.\n\nEthnic Chinese Indonesians bore the brunt of the bloodshed during the riots, when rape squads — purportedly led by army thugs — roamed Jakarta’s streets.\n\n“Was there really mass rape? There was never any proof,” Fadli told local media in an interview last month. “If there is, show it.”\n\nA 1998 fact-finding report, commissioned by Indonesia’s first president after Suharto, found at least 52 reported cases of rape in the unrest.\n\n“This project risks erasing uncomfortable truths,” said Usman Hamid, executive director of Amnesty International Indonesia.\n\nFadli told AFP the nation-building project would go ahead despite criticism. “The consensus (is) we continue,” he said. “This is an updated version of our history,” he added, saying there would be a public debate “this month”, without elaborating.\n\nThe project involves 113 academics, including historians, but at least one of them has resigned.\n\nArchaeologist Harry Truman Simanjuntak told AFP he quit in a dispute over language — the term “early history” was used instead of “prehistory” for Indonesia’s ancient civilisation.\n\nFadli told lawmakers the phrase was avoided because it was created by Indonesia’s former Dutch rulers.\n\nBut Harry said it showed the political influence over the text.\n\n“It was very obvious that the editors’ authority did not exist. They were under the control of the government,” he said.\n\nThe furore around the project has caused some opposition lawmakers and critics to call for its suspension or cancellation.\n\nActivist Maria Catarina Sumarsih, whose son was killed in a military crackdown after Suharto’s fall, accused the writers of warping the past.\n\n“The government is deceiving the public … especially young people,” she said. Others said documenting Indonesia’s past was best left to academics.\n\n“If the government feel this nation needs a history that could make us proud … it can’t be through the government’s version of historical propaganda,” said Marzuki. “It should be the result of the work of historians.”",
