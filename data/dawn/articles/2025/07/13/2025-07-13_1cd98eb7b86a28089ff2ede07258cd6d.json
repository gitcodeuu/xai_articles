  "content": "LAHORE: National volleyball team’s captain Murad Jehan wants an international league in Pakistan, saying it will help the local players sharpen their skills while facing stronger opponents.\n\n“Though six, seven Pakistan players are competing [currently] in different international leagues, the players who are not getting chances in these leagues, have to play with local contestants which is destroying their game,” Murad told reporters at a reception hosted in the honour of the Pakistan team in Lahore on Saturday for winning silver medal in the Asian Volleyball Championship held in Bahrain earlier this month.\n\n“A volleyball league in Pakistan is necessary in order to give all the players better opportunities to improve their skill set. This league will give our players a chance to face the challenge from international-level competitors,” Murad said.\n\n“It [the league] will also [help] produce a nursery of volleyball players in the country.”\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan Volleyball Federation chairman Chaudhry Mohammad Yaqoob said the international league will be held by the end of this year.\n\n“Our marketing company is working very actively and we are very close to engaging a major sponsor [firm], and Inshallah the international league in Pakistan will start by the end of this year,” Yaqoob told media.\n\n“Having signed [a contract] with a major sponsor, PVF’s top priority will not be to introduce the league only but also arrange series for Pakistan’s senior team world’s higher-ranked sides as our target is to qualify for the World Cup and Olympics as well,” he added.\n\n“Our team won silver medal in Bahrain [recently]. We also win 3-0 against Qatar who are world No. 4 team. They have hired the players from countries like Brazil. Therefore, beating Qatar is a big sign [of improvement] for Pakistan volleyball,” he said.\n\n“Our international ranking has also improved after winning the silver medal.”\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, Murad said that Pakistan’s next assignment was the Islamic Solidarity Games, adding the PVF should hold a training camp at the earliest for the said games where Pakistan would be looking to claim gold medal.\n\nThe captain highlighted that the national team’s volleyball players were facing lack of essential facilities.\n\n“There was no air conditioner in the hall [for training] because of which we were compelled to train under 45 degrees. Whereas we played in Bahrain under 20 or 21 degree,” he underlined.\n\n“Moreover, there is an issue of [poor] lighting in the hall. On our part, we are trying to forget these hardships to give our best to earn a good name for our country,’ Murad added.\n\nYaqoob admitted that the players had several complaints about the facilities and about the daily allowances they were getting during the camp.\n\n“With limited resources, we are trying our best to increase resources for the welfare of our players,” he said.\n\nLater, a cash prize of Rs1.5 million was distributed among the players of the national team and its management.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 13th, 2025",
