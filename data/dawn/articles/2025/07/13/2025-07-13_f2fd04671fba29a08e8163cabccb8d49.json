At least 13 homes were damaged by the deluge along with farmlands, crops, water and irrigation channels and other properties in Shiroot and Shakyot areas of Gilgit.\n\nA flash flood and landslides at Bargo Pari area in Gilgit damaged a car, two motorcycles and a tractor. Falling rocks blocked the Gilgit-Ghizer Road, which disrupted traffic for many hours.\n\nMr Babar of GBDMA stated that the road was later cleared and reopened for traffic. The authority is assessing damages in the area. No loss of human life or injury was recorded, he said. He added the cloudburst-induced flood also damaged farmlands and infrastructure in Biarchi and Gulapur areas of Ghizer. He said the authority was working to restore link roads in the area.\n\nThe Naltar expressway has been blocked at 10 locations from Nomaal to Naltar Valley.\n\nGBDMA DG Zakir Hussain, along with Nagar Deputy Commissioner Asghar Khan and other officials, visited the affected sites in Nagar district, including Hamari Tokorkot and Supultar nullahs.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, floods damaged 20 homes and crops in Babusar area of Chilas.\n\nOn Friday, light rainfall across GB brought down the temperature.\n\nRecovery efforts\n\nThis year, record-high summer temperatures in Gilgit-Baltistan have accelerated the melting of glaciers, leading to heavy flooding in districts across the region.\n\nLast week, the maximum temperature in Chilas was 48.5°C, the highest since July 17, 1997, when it was recorded at 47.7°C. In Bunji, the temperature jumped to 46.1°C, the highest since July 1971.\n\nThe GBDMA DG has issued directives to expedite the restoration of irrigation channels damaged by recent floods.\n\nThe extensive damage to farmlands and crops and the unavailability of water posed a risk of drought in the region.\n\nMr Hussain told Dawn that GBDMA is prepared to protect vulnerable communities and dozens of households have been relocated to safer places.\n\nThe affected families in Nagar, Gilgit, Ghizer and Diamer have been provided with food and other items.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 13th, 2025",
