They are indispensable for a just international order,” he added.\n\nThe deputy PM asserted that Pakistan’s leadership has been guided by “these very principles in both deliberations and concrete actions taken during its tenure”.\n\n“This is a time of growing turbulence in the world, where the costs of unresolved disputes, long-running conflicts, unilateral actions, and disregard for international law are being felt in every region of the world,” Dar noted.\n\nDar’s remarks came as Pakistan holds the presidency of the UNSC this month. Pakistan assumed the UNSC presidency for July, marking its first presidency since 2013. Islamabad began its current two-year term as a non-permanent member in January 2025 and will serve through the end of 2026.\n\nThe UNSC unanimously adopted Pakistan-sponsored Resolution 2788 yesterday, calling for the strengthening of international mechanisms to settle disputes through peaceful means.\n\nDar also announced Pakistan was seeking a seat at the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) for the 2026-2028 term, with the Asia-Pacific Group endorsing its candidacy. Pakistan last held the membership from 2020 to 2023.\n\n“Our engagement with the Human Rights Council is guided by the values of truth, tolerance, mutual respect, consensus-building, and engagement,” he said, expressing the hope for broad international support.\n\nSpeaking to diplomats, UN officials and representatives of member states at the Pakistan Mission, Dar outlined three priorities that Pakistan will focus on during its UNSC presidency.\n\nHe described the peaceful settlement of disputes, a core principle of the UN Charter, as “too often sidelined” and highlighted the need to bring it back to the centre of the council’s work.\n\nHe stressed the importance of revitalising “We see multilateralism not as a slogan, but as a necessity,” Dar said.\n\n“The Security Council must be seen not only as a chamber of reaction but as a forum of prevention, problem-solving, and principled leadership,” he asserted.\n\nHe then detailed Pakistan’s third priority — enhancing cooperation between the UN and regional organisations, particularly the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\n\nDar stated that a UNSC briefing with the OIC was scheduled for July 24, highlighting the 57-member body’s vital role in global peacebuilding.\n\nReaffirming Pakistan’s active diplomatic engagement, the deputy PM said the country remained committed to working with partners around the world to advance the shared goals of peace, development, and human rights.\n\n“Pakistan is a leading voice in the global climate and development discourse — from the General Assembly to the UN Ecosoc (Economic and Social Council) and elsewhere,” he noted.\n\nHe highlighted Pakistan’s leadership in global climate and development discourse and reiterated its support for strengthening the UN’s three pillars: peace and security, development, and human rights.\n\nConcluding his address, Dar urged the global community to rise above divisions. “In a world facing deepening divides and mounting challenges, we must choose cooperation over confrontation, and diplomacy over force.\n\n“Pakistan stands ready to work with all of you to advance these common goals,” he affirmed.",
