  "content": "NEW YORK: Elon Musk, who most recently served as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump, may return to US politics, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing SpaceX documents and people familiar with the content.\n\nThe company added the language laying out such “risk factors” in paperwork sent to investors discussing a tender offer, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIt was the first time this language is believed to have appeared in these tender offers.\n\nBillionaire Musk’s SpaceX is planning an insider share sale that would value the space firm at about $400 billion, Bloomberg reported last week.\n\nMusk said on Sunday in a post on X that he was back to working seven days a week and sleeping in the office.\n\nMusk, the world’s richest man, spent nearly $300 million last year to help Trump and other Republicans get elected. He led the administration’s sweeping cost-cutting campaign, upending several federal agencies but ultimately failed to deliver the massive savings he had sought.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
