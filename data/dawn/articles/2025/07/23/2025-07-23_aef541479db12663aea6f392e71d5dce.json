The uncle and area residents caught the man, who was beaten and handed over to police. He was identified as Shaharyar.\n\nDuring grilling, the held suspect told the police that his in-laws had given him the child. On the information extracted from the suspect, the police also arrested the couple.\n\nAccording to media reports, the child had been kidnapped when he was returning home from a local shop in Shah Latif Town. The family had been desperately searching everywhere for the missing child.\n\nArea residents told the media that several children had been abducted from their area, and they strongly suspected that an organised kidnapping gang might be behind the disappearances.\n\nThey have urged the authorities to carry out a thorough investigation into the missing children.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
