  "content": "LAHORE: Houses and standing crops in hundreds of villages of Punjab were inundated because of low-to-medium level flooding in various rivers of the province, forcing evacuations in the affected and vulnerable areas.\n\nA large number of residents of the affected villages were displaced, while evacuation was underway in many others as water levels in the rivers, including the Ravi, Sutlej and Indus continue to rise.\n\nResidents are being evacuated from the katcha areas of Muzaffargarh, Dera Ghazi Khan and Rahim Yar Khan due to the rising water levels in the Chenab and Indus rivers.\n\nOver 20 villages were witnessing floods and hundreds of acres of crops were affected in Jhang district because of the rising water levels in the river Jhelum.\n\nThe river Sutlej has seen low-level flooding at Sulemanki, while there are concerns about the potential releases of water from Indian dams on the Beas and Sutlej rivers.\n\nPeople in the affected areas have been forced to move to safer places, along with their cattle, as floodwater has damaged their houses, crops and road infrastructure. The inundation of roads has made it further difficult for the people to move around and access essential services.\n\nThe authorities are urging the residents of vulnerable areas to evacuate, also providing them with assistance in evacuations.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department’s (PMD) flood forecasting division reported that the river Indus is in low flood at Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, Taunsa and Guddu, while the river Chenab at Khanki is also in low flood. All other rivers, including the Ravi, Jhelum and Sutlej are flowing within their normal range.\n\nThe inflow at Khanki is 120,000 cusecs, while the outflow is 116,000 cusecs. The water flow in the river Chenab at Marala, Qadirabad and Trimmu is normal. The inflow at Kalabagh is 332,000 cusecs, while the outflow is 324,000 cusecs. The inflow at Taunsa is 363,000 while the outflow is 357,000 cusecs.\n\nThe water flow at Tarbela is 350,000 cusecs, while at Chashma it is 340,000, where the outflow is 320,000 cusecs.\n\nAs per the PDMA, there is a risk of flooding in the major rivers and their adjacent streams in Punjab from July 22 to 24. The water flow in Dera Ghazi Khan rivers and canals is normal.\n\nMeanwhile, the Punjab PDMA has issued a low-to-medium flood alert in the Jhelum and Chenab rivers.\n\nWater flow in the rivers is increasing due to the heavy monsoon rains and glacial melting.\n\nPDMA Director General (DG) Irfan Ali Kathia has directed the commissioners and deputy commissioners of the concerned districts to remain alert.\n\nHe said that in view of the possible flood threat, arrangements are complete in vulnerable districts. The water level in Mangla Dam is 50 percent and in Tarbela it is 79pc.\n\nThe water level in Indian dams on Sutlej, Beas and Ravi is up to 36pc. The PDMA control room and district emergency operation centres are monitoring the situation around the clock.\n\nMr Kathia said that an alert has been issued to the commissioners of Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan and Dera Ghazi Khan divisions. He said an alert has also been issued to the DCs of Rawalpindi, Attock, Chakwal, Murree, Jhelum, Gujranwala, Sialkot, Gujrat, Mandi Bahauddin, Wazirabad, Sargodha, Narowal, Jhang, Kot Addo and other relevant districts. An alert of urban flooding has been issued in Rawalpindi and Gujranwala divisions, he added.\n\nThe DG further said that a flood alert has been issued to the local government, agriculture, irrigation, health, forest, livestock and transport departments, besides Civil Defense, Rescue 1122 and related institutions, directing them to complete rescue and relief arrangements in advance.\n\nHe claimed that all arrangements had been completed in advance and that staff in emergency control rooms had been directed to remain on alert to meet any emergency.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
