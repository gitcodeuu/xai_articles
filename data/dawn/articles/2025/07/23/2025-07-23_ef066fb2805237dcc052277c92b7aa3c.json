  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The management of Capital Development Authority (CDA) has barred its officials from travelling to a Gulf country for the ‘unprecedented’ transfer of an agricultural plot in Islamabad.\n\nThree officials from the CDA and one from the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration were all set to visit the Gulf country for the transfer of a 2.72 acre plot owned by a former diplomat to another citizen of that country. However, the officials were barred from the visit. The property can’t be transferred without prior approval of the federal government.\n\nSources said that in February last year, the ministry of interior issued a No-Objection Certificate (NOC) for the transfer of the plot. Subsequently, the CDA management decided to send its four-member team to the said country at the expense of its embassy.\n\nHowever, sources said that when the issue was highlighted by this newspaper, the CDA management decided not to proceed further, as according to Foreign Act 1946, which was adopted by the government of Pakistan, no foreigner can purchase land in Pakistan without previous permission in writing from the federal government.\n\nWhen contacted, a spokesperson for the civic agency stated: “CDA had initially processed the case in accordance with Section 13 of the Property Manual, which permits purchase of property by foreign nationals subject to prior approval from the Ministry of Interior, Government of Pakistan.”\n\nHe added, “However, the Federal Government has clarified that, in light of the Notification dated 9th September 1984 issued under the Foreigners Act, 1946, explicit approval from the Federal Government is required for any such acquisition.”\n\n“Accordingly, the provisional arrangement has been stopped, and the case may only be reprocessed once the requisite approval from the Federal Government is obtained by the prospective buyer,” the spokesperson said. It is further clarified that no arrangement was ever intended or made at public expense.\n\nAn officer of CDA said: “On a request of the ambassador of one of our brotherly countries, we only proceeded in accordance with the NOC granted by the Ministry of Interior in February 2024, but we have stopped this matter, now the federal government will decide the fate of this case.”\n\nFollowing the development, Dawn collected information on whether any foreigner can purchase land in Islamabad or not. It has transpired that under the Foreigner Act 1946, foreigners can’t purchase any property in Pakistan, particularly after 1984.\n\nA notification issued by the Ministry of Interior in September 1984 stated: “In exercise of powers conferred by section 3 of the Foreigner Act, 1946, the federal government is pleased to order that – (a) no foreigner shall, directly or indirectly, acquire land or any interest in land or landed property in Pakistan except with the previous permission in writing of the Federal Government or of the Provincial Government and in accordance with the conditions subject to which the permission is granted; and (b) any foreigner who, at any time before the coming into force of this Order, has acquired directly or indirectly, land or any interest in land or landed property in Pakistan shall, if so required, submit to the Federal Government or the Provincial Government, or to any authority authorized by any such Government in this behalf, full particulars of such land or property and the purposes for which it is being used.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
