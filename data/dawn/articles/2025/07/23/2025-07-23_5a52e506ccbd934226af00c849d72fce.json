She stressed that legal disputes must be settled in courts, and even tribal feuds should be resolved through jirgas, not through violence.\n\nProvincial minister Raheela Hameed Khan Durrani said the killing of the couple was a tragic event and a stark reminder that such incidents were occurring even in the 21st century. “No one has the right to take a life,” she asserted. Adviser to the Chief Minister Meena Majeed Baloch called for the elimination of outdated customs related to women.\n\nJI leader Maulana Hidayatur Rehman also condemned the killings, affirming that while Islam promoted honour and modesty, it did not permit anyone to violate the sanctity of life or household.\n\nEarlier, Balochistan National Party (BNP-Awami) MPA Mir Asad Baloch staged a walkout against a CTD raid at his residence. Speaking on a point of order, he stated that security forces stormed his home on July 9. “If there were any allegations, I should have been summoned,” he said, adding that he was taken to the CTD Centre and released after four hours. “The use of such force only breeds resentment,” he remarked before walking out.\n\nBHC CJ briefed\n\nMeanwhile, police officials informed Balochistan High Court Chief Justice Rozi Khan Barech that no further arrests had been made in the case.\n\nThey said the brother of the slain woman had also been on the run. “Efforts are underway to arrest Jalal, who shot his sister after the jirga ordered the killing of the man and woman,” sources said.\n\nHome Additional Chief Secre­tary Hamza Shafqaat, Additional IG Saeed Wazir, and SSP Serious Crime Investigation Abdul Saboor Agha appeared before the chief justice in his chamber and submitted a progress report.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
