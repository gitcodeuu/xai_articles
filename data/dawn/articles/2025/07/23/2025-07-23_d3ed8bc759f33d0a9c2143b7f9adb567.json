  "content": "WASHINGTON: Seven-time Grand Slam single champion Venus Williams returned to competitive tennis after a 16-month hiatus on Monday with a doubles victory at the WTA and ATP Washington Open.\n\nThe 45-year-old American joined compatriot Hailey Baptiste to defeat Canada’s Eugenie Bouchard and US teen Clervie Ngounoue 6-3, 6-1 in a first-round match.\n\n“After the match Hailey asked me, ‘How did that feel?’ It’s probably even harder to play the doubles first because I’m not a doubles player,” Venus said.\n\n“So it’s great to have her to kind of hold the team up. She has had the experience. She served first because she has been playing all year and playing well. I think that helped me a lot.\n\n“I think also just to get the feel for the ball. Obviously singles I have a little more experience even though doubles I have had some great results.\n\n“It’s just nice to be able to play. Where I am at this year is so much different where I was at last year. It’s night and day, being able to be here and prepare for the tournament as opposed to preparing for surgery a year ago.”\n\nA crowd of about 3,000 spectators watched the doubles match, including NBA star Kevin Durant, who is from Washington.\n\nBouchard will retire next week in Canada and was pleased for one last meeting with Williams.\n\n“To play against her one last time is fun and special,” Bouchard said. “I was like kudos to you to keep kicking it. She’s 14 years older than me and still plugging away. I have nothing but respect for her. She’s such a legend.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
