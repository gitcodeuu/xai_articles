The Nikkei rose 3.5pc.\n\n“We are the first (country) in the world to reduce tariffs on automobiles and auto parts, with no limits on volume,” he told reporters.\n\n“By protecting what needs to be protected, we continued the negotiations with an aim to reach an agreement that meets the national interest of both Japan and the United States,” Ishiba added.\n\nHowever, Japan’s trade envoy Ryosei Akazawa, who secured the deal on his eighth visit to Washington, said the 50pc tariffs on steel and aluminium would remain.\n\nAkazawa also said increased defence spending by Japan — something Trump has pressed for — was not part of the agreement.\n\nTrump said on Tuesday Japan has also agreed to “open their country to trade, including cars and trucks, rice and certain other agricultural products, and other things”.\n\nRice imports are a sensitive issue in Japan, and Ishiba’s government — which lost its upper house majority in elections on Sunday — had previously ruled out any concessions.\n\nJapan currently imports 770,000 tons of rice tariff-free under its World Trade Organisation commitments, and Ishiba said it would import more US grain within this.\n\nIshiba said on Wednesday that the deal does not “sacrifice” Japan’s agricultural sector.\n\nTatsuo Yasunaga, the chair of Japan Foreign Trade Council, welcomed the trade deal announcement but said the business community needed to see details to assess its impact.\n\n“I highly commend the fact that this major milestone has been achieved and dispelled the uncertainty that private companies had been concerned about,” Yasunaga said.\n\nNaomi Omura, an 80-year-old voter, said it was “disappointing that Japan cannot act more strongly” towards the US.\n\nTetsuo Momiyama, 81, said that Ishiba “is finished … It’s good timing for him to go”.\n\nReports claimed on Wednesday that he aims to step down soon following the election debacle.\n\nOther major US trading partners are watching closely as the end of the month approaches.\n\nThe Philippines’ deal also announced on Tuesday only saw levies cut by one percentage point, to 19pc, after Trump hosted President Ferdinand Marcos. China on Wednesday said it supported “equal dialogue” following the announcement of the Japan-US deal.\n\nBeijing and Washington imposed escalating, tit-for-tat levies on each other’s exports earlier this year, reaching triple-digit levels.\n\nBut in talks in Geneva in May, they agreed to lower them temporarily until August 12.",
