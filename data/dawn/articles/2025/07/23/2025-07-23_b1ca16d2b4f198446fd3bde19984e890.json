To a casual observer, it’s a simple source of childhood joy. But for health workers and local leaders in Balochistan, it symbolises something far greater: hope in the fight against polio.\n\nThe Immunity Express initiative in Balochistan is part of the broader Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme, aiming to reach children in high-risk areas with the polio vaccine. This initiative uses creative methods, like incorporating fun activities and community engagement, to encourage vaccination and ensure children receive the life-saving vaccine in high-risk areas of Quetta.\n\nUnder the initiative polio teams in high-risk areas of Quetta are using camel rides, swings, and fun-filled activities to attract children and ensure they receive the life-saving polio vaccine.\n\nIn a province long challenged by persistent poliovirus transmission, 2025 is offering the most encouraging signs yet. As of July, Balochistan has not reported a single case of wild poliovirus. And according to the Emergency Operations Centre (EOC), the prevalence of the virus in environmental samples has sharply declined.\n\nInitiative part of broader polio eradication programme\n\nIn June 2025, just 4 out of 23 environmental samples (17 per cent) across the province tested positive for poliovirus. In the high-risk Quetta Block, an area considered a traditional epicenter of transmission, only one out of seven samples (14 per cent) showed traces of the virus. This marks the lowest level of virus detection in over 18 months.\n\n“This progress reflects the resilience and dedication of everyone involved, from health workers to community leaders,” said Inamul Haq, Coordinator of the Emergency Operations Centre in Balochistan.\n\nHealth officials attribute the success to a coordinated, community-wide effort. Religious leaders have promoted vaccination from pulpits and community gatherings. Media campaigns have pushed back against misinformation, while development partners provided vital technical and logistical support. At the core of it all, the government of Balochistan and district administrations have demonstrated strong leadership, ensuring that each vaccination campaign is thoroughly planned, funded, and monitored.\n\nInitiatives like Immunity Express, social mobiliser programmes, and journalist engagement sessions have played a critical role in improving vaccine uptake — especially in historically underserved or vaccine-hesitant communities.\n\n“Environmental sample positivity is declining, and that gives us hope,” said Mr Haque. “But the virus still lurks. The moment we become complacent, it will strike again.”\n\nWhile the battle against polio is far from over, the absence of reported cases in 2025 and the downward trend in environmental detections point to real momentum in Balochistan’s efforts to end the disease.\n\nAs Ayaan laughs and swings with carefree delight, he represents more than a healthy child — he is a symbol of what’s possible when communities, institutions, and governments come together.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
