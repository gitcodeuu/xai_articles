  "content": "KARACHI: The Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) on Tuesday expressed concern over the eviction of families from several dilapidated buildings in the old city area and cast doubts on the government intentions regarding the fate of the vacated buildings, many of which date back to the pre-partition era.\n\nThe party also demanded that the Sindh government provide two years’ rent and alternative housing to families evicted from dilapidated building following the collapse of a multi-storey building in Lyari’s Baghdadi area that claimed lives of 27 persons.\n\nThe demand was raised by MNA Dr Arshad Abdullah Vohra and MPAs Taha Ahmed and Dilawar Khan during a press conference held at the party’s Bahadurabad headquarters.\n\nDr Vohra criticised the Sindh government’s handling of dilapidated buildings in the city, particularly in old city areas like Lyari, where many structures predate the creation of Pakistan.\n\nHe claimed that following the collapse, authorities vacated 41 buildings in the vicinity, often using force to evict residents without offering any viable alternatives. “Was the government asleep before this tragedy?” he asked, accusing the provincial administration of negligence and poor planning.\n\nParty demands two-year rent support and housing for displaced families\n\n“These people are now on the streets without shelter. The government must prepare a comprehensive resettlement plan for them,” he added.\n\nHe warned of possible exploitation, alleging that there are genuine concerns that the vacated lands will be sold off to builder “mafias”, facilitated by “corrupt elements” within the Sindh government.\n\n“Land worth millions has already been consumed by these mafias,” the MQM-P leader alleged.\n\nDr Vohra said the party had also extended its support to the victims and urged them to submit their documentation to the party so that it could legally fight for their rights.\n\nHe emphasised that MQM-P had always stood with the people of Karachi and demanded that government-formed committees include public representatives to ensure transparency and accountability in the rehabilitation process.\n\n“If the demands are not met, and 5,000 displaced families gather outside the CM House, the situation could spiral out of control,” he warned, adding that it would be unacceptable if the land was handed over to private “developers” rather than being used for public good.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
