Of them, 13 applied for leave in advance, while 46 submitted the application while on leave or after returning.\n\nThe leave applications of the remaining 20 lawmakers were read on a day falling in the middle of their period of absence.\n\nAs many as 46 members sought approval for the entire duration of their absence, while the remaining 36 were absent for longer than the number of days for which they had requested leave.\n\nAs many as 156 members remained absent without submitting any application during the session.\n\nA total of 22 female MNAs, including 19 on reserved seats and three on general seats attended all sittings.\n\nMeanwhile, all seven minority members attended more than half of the sittings, including three who attended all sittings.\n\nAmong male MNAs elected on general seats, 10 did not attend any sitting, 35 were present in less than half of the sittings and 208 attended more than half of the sittings. Meanwhile, 54 were present in every sitting.\n\nAmong the cabinet members, the federal ministers for parliamentary affairs and public affairs unit attended all sittings.\n\nLikewise, the ministers of state for overseas Pakistanis and human resource development, national food security & research, and religious affairs & interfaith harmony were present throughout the session.\n\nThe majority of lawmakers from PML-N, PPP, MQM-P and Sunni Ittehad Council (SIC) attended more than half of the sittings.\n\nThe sole member of Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen Pakistan attended every sitting.\n\nLawmakers from the Balochistan Awami Party, National Party and the PML-Zia attended more than half of the sittings.\n\nThe sole representative of the PkMAP attended less than half of the sittings.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 23rd, 2025",
