The Sutlej river has seen low-level flooding at Sulemanki, while there are concerns about the potential releases of water from Indian dams on the Beas and Sutlej rivers.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a fresh alert for glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nSeparately, KP PDMA has also issued a Glof alert for Chitral Upper, Chitral Lower, Dir Upper, Swat and Kohistan Upper.\n\nA PMD advisory issued on Tuesday said the ongoing rainfall spell is likely to continue and can affect KP and GB during the week.\n\nThe prevailing weather conditions will increase the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in vulnerable regions of GB and KP.\n\nThe Met Office has advised local authorities to remain alert and take necessary measures to protect human lives and property.\n\nThe NDMA has warned of landslides in northern regions in view of the forecast monsoon rains.\n\nThe authority has cautioned PDMAs, rescue services, local administration, armed forces and NGOs to prepare for possible emergency situations.\n\nAs per the projection, isolated rainfall is expected in Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamir, Ghanche, Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, Haveli, Bagh, and Poonch areas of GB and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.
