  "content": "MANAMA: Pakistan’s Ahsan Ramzan stormed into the semi-finals of the IBSF Under-21 World Snooker Championship with a dominant display on Wednesday, while the nation’s challenge in the 6-Red event concluded after hard-fought knockout battles here at the Crowne Plaza hotel.\n\nThe 19-year-old Ahsan delivered a commanding performance to secure his semi-final berth.\n\nIn the quarter-finals, Ahsan — who won the world amateur title in 2022 — overwhelmed India’s Mayur Garg 4-0 (103(58)-42(32), 82(35)-0, 56-39, 74(48)-23), showcasing consistent scoring and control.\n\nThis followed his victory in the all-Pakistani last-16 clash earlier on Wednesday, where he defeated compatriot and Under-17 world champion Mohammad Hasnain Akhtar 4-1 [70-54, 107(99)-0, 0-72(60), 106(69)-32, 64(37)-6]. Ahsan’s near-flawless 99 break in the second frame highlighted his potent break-building ability.\n\nMeanwhile in the 6-red competition, Pakistan’s trio battled fiercely but ultimately exited in the knockout stages.\n\nAsif was the first to exit on Wednesday, losing his last 30 match. Shahid Aftab and Ahsan followed, bowing out in the last 16 round.\n\nAsif, the reigning Masters champion, suffered a narrow 4-3 defeat to Iraq’s Firas Kamil Shaba (35-20, 29-42, 8-36, 4-49(48), 54(35)-1, 38-34, 39(30)-22) despite being 3-1 up.\n\nNational champion Shahid won his first knockout match with a 4-2 victory over Hong Kong’s Chau Hon Man [25-41, 52-12, 56(35)-0, 36-28, 1-51, 44(44)-9) but later lost to Shaba 4-3 [25-10, 1-48, 13-36, 49-27, 2-41(35), 41-2, 49(45)-9] in a seesaw pre-quarter clash.\n\nSimilarly, Ahsan edged Scotland’s Ayaan Iqbal 4-3 (2-39, 54-0, 29-30(30), 29-10, 31(31)-17, 4-62, 44(38)-0) in a tense last 30 match.\n\nIn the thrilling last 16 match, Ahsan pushed India’s Aditya Mehta to the limit but fell 4-3 (25-37, 17-47, 37-27, 50(45)-2, 0-50, 49-4, 71(71)-0), with Mehta sealing victory with a decisive 71 clearance.\n\nAhsan now carries Pakistan’s sole remaining medal hope into the U-21 semi-finals on Thursday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 24th, 2025",
