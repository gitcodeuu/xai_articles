According to him, perceptions about the province often differ sharply from reality, especially outside Balochistan, and must be corrected through greater historical understanding.\n\nCM Bugti highlighted the ideological diversity in Balochistan’s political past by referencing separatist leader Nawab Khair Bakhsh Marri and democratic advocate Mir Ghaus Bakhsh Bizenjo. He linked current anti-state activity to distorted historical narratives and said the government is open to dialogue with disillusioned youth—provided they work within constitutional limits. Those advocating violence or secession, however, would not be engaged.\n\n“Terrorism—whether justified by nationalism or religion—is unacceptable,” he stressed.\n\nRejecting the idea that the insurgency stems from underdevelopment or joblessness, Bugti clarified that these concerns, while valid, do not justify armed rebellion. He said those who take up arms are pursuing a separatist agenda, which runs counter to the Constitution and national unity.\n\nReferring to past operations, he said isolated action in areas like Kalat was often misrepresented as province-wide military action, calling for an accurate reading of history to shape a better future.\n\n“Terrorist groups cannot sustain long-term control. Their objective is to instill fear and disturb peace,” he warned, adding that the Baloch people are being pushed toward a damaging and pointless conflict that must be avoided.\n\nOn the issue of missing persons, he noted that the provincial government has introduced thorough legislation to improve investigation processes. Broader governance and service reforms are also being implemented to improve public service delivery and rebuild public trust.\n\nDiscussing health and education, Bugti said that nearly all hiring in these sectors—99.99 per cent —was done purely on merit. He added that Balochistan’s students are being granted national and international scholarships to help them compete globally.\n\nOn anti-corruption efforts, he stated that the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team and the Anti-Corruption Department have been made fully functional to ensure transparency. Key appointments in education boards, such as the Balochistan Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education and the Textbook Board, were based on merit, leading to significant improvements.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 24th, 2025",
