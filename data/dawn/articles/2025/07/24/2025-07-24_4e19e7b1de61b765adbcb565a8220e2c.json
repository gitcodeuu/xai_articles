  "content": "KARACHI: BYD Pakis­tan is set to launch the country’s first plug-in hybrid electric pickup, the Shark 6, on Friday, marking a significant step in the local adoption of new energy vehicles (NEVs).\n\nThe launch comes as the Chinese automaker positions Pakistan as a key regional market and establishes a local production plant, laying the groundwork for greater penetration of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) across the country.\n\nSpeaking at an experiential workshop on Tuesday, Lei Jian, Country Head of BYD Pakistan, said the company’s vertically integrated supply chain and ongoing research and development efforts have enabled it to create a platform that is both intelligent and efficient.\n\n“The engine activates only when needed, ensuring a stress-free experience during long-distance travel,” he said.\n\nDanish Khaliq, Vice President of Sales and Strategy at BYD Pakistan, explained the distinction between hybrid electric vehicles and PHEVs.\n\nWhile HEVs primarily rely on petrol engines and recharge their batteries through the engine or regenerative braking, PHEVs are equipped with larger batteries that can be charged externally.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 24th, 2025",
