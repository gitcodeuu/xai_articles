I asked my employees, but the matter was brushed aside,” he said, adding that soon after, the woman sought medical leave for fifteen days.\n\nThe Chinese citizen said he discovered that cash worth Rs2m and jewellery worth Rs1m were also missing. He named the woman and her husband as suspects in the case.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said a day earlier that the government was building a safe and business-friendly environment for the Chinese community in Pakistan by enhancing their security.\n\n“The confidence of Chinese companies in the Pakistani economy is extremely important for our economic future,” the prime minister said while chairing a meeting regarding security arrangements for Chinese citizens in Pakistan.\n\nHe acknowledged that measures were being taken to enhance the security of Chinese nationals across the country, including in Islamabad.",
