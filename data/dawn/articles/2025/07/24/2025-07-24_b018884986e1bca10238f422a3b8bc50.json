  "content": "LAHORE: A day after several PTI leaders were sentenced to rigorous imprisonment over May 9 violence, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) questioned the timing and the severity of the sentence, saying it risked being perceived as “politically motivated rather than legally transparent”, whereas a PTI spokesperson termed it an attempt to ‘suppress’ the Aug 5 movement.\n\n“This unlawful verdict is an attempt to suppress PTI’s upcoming August 5 movement, but PTI has neither bowed, nor paused, nor will it succumb to pressure,” said PTI Punjab media cell head Shayan Bashir in response to the anti-terrorism court ruling announced on Tuesday.\n\nHRCP concerned\n\nMeanwhile, the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan (HRCP) has expressed concern over the convictions of PTI leaders Dr Yasmin Rashid, Omar Sarfraz Cheema, Ejaz Chaudhry, among others, who have already served over two years in prison in connection with the events of May 9, 2023.\n\nIn a statement posted on its X handle, the HRCP stated that the timing and severity of these convictions, resulting in 10-year sentences, risked being perceived as politically motivated rather than legally transparent.\n\nWhile HRCP upholds the need for accountability in instances of violence or unlawful conduct, it stated that the use of anti-terrorism legislation against political figures in this context raises questions about proportionality and adherence to due process. This amounts to undermining public confidence in the justice system, it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 24th, 2025",
