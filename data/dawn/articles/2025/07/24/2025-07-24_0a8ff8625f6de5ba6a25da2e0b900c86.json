  "content": "PESHAWAR: Opposition parties in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) on Wednes­day staged a collective boycott of a Multi-Party Conference (MPC) on the province’s law and order situation, convened by KP Chief Minister Ali Amin Khan Gandapur.\n\nThe conference, billed as a crucial step towards “formulating a joint strategy to ensure sustainable peace” in the terrorism-hit region, was snubbed by all major opposition parties.\n\nThey said the refusal to attend was rooted in the government’s lack of seriousness in addressing the issue.\n\n“I have contacted all the opposition parties, and we have jointly boycotted the provincial government’s MPC,” Leader of the Opposition in the KP Assembly Dr Ibadullah told Dawn. He said that the government would have debated the law and order situation in the assembly if it had been truly concerned.\n\nQuestion provincial government’s sincerity on improving law and order situation\n\n“Their debates in the assembly revolved around their incarcerated party founder.”\n\nMr Gandapur defended the conference as an opportunity to share details of the administration’s actions and plans, and to seek input from across the political spectrum.\n\n“Development of the province is everybody’s responsibility,” Mr Gandapur told reporters.\n\n“They [the opposition] do politics in everything, and if they do not want to attend the conference, it means they don’t care about the KP residents.”\n\nHowever, opposition leaders were scathing in their response.\n\nDr Ibadullah accused the government of facilitating militants, alleging that Mr Gandapur himself had admitted to paying extortion to militants during an apex committee meeting.\n\n“The chief minister made a tall claim that he would allow no military operation in the province,” Mr Ibadullah said.\n\n“Operations are currently being carried out, but he is silent.”\n\nHe also noted that the opposition had held an MPC at the Governor House, but the government refused to attend.\n\nWith the addition of reserved seats for women and non-Muslims, he said, the opposition can call a provincial assembly meeting to discuss law and order.\n\nThe government announced the MPC following a July 18 cabinet meeting, framing it as a consultative forum to develop a locally supported strategy for lasting peace.\n\nMr Gandapur argued that while border management remains the military’s domain, jirgas are essential to bridging the gap between the military and the public.\n\nOther major opposition parties also confirmed their boycott.\n\nThe ANP’s Arbab Muhammad Usman Khan said his party has been working for peace and has called its own jirga for July 26.\n\nAbdul Jalil Jan, a provincial spokesperson for JUI-F, also confirmed his party’s boycott.\n\nPPP’s Ahmad Karim Kundi told Dawn that in October 2024, CM Gandapur had pledged that all provincial matters would be thoroughly debated in the assembly and fully implemented.\n\n“What happened to those promises he made after all the political parties in the KP Assembly, through their joint efforts and timely intervention, resolved the controversy surrounding PTM’s Pash­toon Qaumi Jirga?” Mr Kundi asked.\n\nIn contrast, a statement from Markaz Islami confirmed the Jamaat-i-Islami would attend the conference. JI’s spokesperson for central KP, Noorul Wahid Jadoon, said that given the law and order situation, JI deputy emir Prof Muhammad Ibrahim would participate.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 24th, 2025",
