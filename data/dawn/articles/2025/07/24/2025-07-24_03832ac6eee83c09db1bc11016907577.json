  "content": "MUZAFFARABAD: The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) government has approved an increase in the ration and risk allowances for police personnel and incorporated the uniform allowance into their monthly salaries, four cabinet ministers announced on Wednesday.\n\nThe decision followed peaceful protests by police personnel outside the offices of their respective district police chiefs on Monday and Tuesday, demanding improved pay and service conditions through a 10-point charter of demands.\n\nAt a press conference, AJK’s Senior Minister for Home Affairs Waqar Ahmed Noor acknowledged their concerns and said the government had taken prompt steps to address many of them.\n\nHe was accompanied by Finance Minister Abdul Majid Khan, Law Minister Mian Abdul Waheed, Food Minister Chaudhry Akbar Ibrahim, and Information Secretary Sardar Adnan Khurshid.\n\n“Our police force has shown remarkable professionalism and restraint over the past two years, particularly during mass protests, long marches, and emerging threats like terrorism,” Mr Noor said. “They have sustained injuries and even laid down their lives without retaliating.”\n\nHe said the government had allocated Rs 4 billion to the police in the previous budget and also launched capacity-building initiatives, including infrastructure development and fresh recruitment.\n\nHowever, he admitted that allowances had not kept pace with ground realities. The risk allowance, frozen at the 2008 pay scale, will now be aligned with the 2015 scale. The uniform allowance, previously disbursed through the central police office at Rs 110 million annually, will now be paid directly with monthly salaries. The ration allowance has also been enhanced.\n\nAsked about the financial impact, both home and finance ministers said calculations were still underway. A committee of senior police officers will be formed to review the remaining demands.\n\n“These measures are not favours, but rightful acknowledgments of the nature and scope of police duties,” Mr Noor said, adding that all personnel had resumed duties and attempts to exploit the protests had failed.\n\nRain-related preparedness\n\nMr Noor said all departments were on high alert following forecasts of eight severe weather spells—four still expected. Vulnerable homes had been identified, with evacuation notices served. Schools would serve as temporary shelters.\n\nRs 800 million had been placed at the disposal of the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) for emergency supplies. Five remote-controlled boats had been deployed, and the government was considering drones for rescue missions.\n\nThe cabinet also paid tribute to the struggling Kashmiris across the LoC, the martyrs from army and police and those lost to harsh weather, he said, adding that it also reaffirmed its support for the 12 legislative seats reserved for Pakistan-based refugees from Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 24th, 2025",
