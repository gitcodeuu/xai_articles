  "content": "WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump’s administration on Wedn­esday launched an investigation into Harvard University’s ability to sponsor visiting students and academics, part of a continuing crackdown on the elite institution.\n\nSince taking office in January, Trump has repeatedly accused Harvard and other top US universities of having a “liberal” bias, accusing some of “antisemitism” to cut federal funding and demand greater oversight.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio said the latest investigation would examine whether the university was complying with regulations in the Exchange Visitor Prog­ramme.\n\nThat included probing whether the university was “conducting their programmes in a manner that does not undermine the foreign policy objectives or compromise the national security interests of the United States.”\n\n“The American people have the right to expect their universities to uphold national security, comply with the law, and provide safe environments for all students,” he said in a statement.\n\nHarvard has so far defied Trump’s calls to submit to oversight of its curriculum, staffing, stud­ent recruitment and “viewpoint diversity.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 24th, 2025",
