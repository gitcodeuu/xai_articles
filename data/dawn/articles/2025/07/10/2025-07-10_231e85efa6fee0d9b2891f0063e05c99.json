  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The government announced a two-phase plan on Wednesday to import 350,000 tonnes of sugar through the Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP), aiming to stabilise domestic prices and ensure the availability of affordable, quality sugar.\n\nThe decision was taken during a meeting of the Steering Committee on Sugar Import, chaired by Minister for National Food Security and Research Rana Tanveer Hussain. The committee approved the issuance of a tender for 200,000 tonnes in the first phase, followed by another tender for 150,000 tonnes a week later.\n\nThe import volumes were determined based on immediate market needs and projected demand in the coming weeks. The sugar will be of a premium, coarse-grain variety, commonly consumed in the country, and will be subject to strict post-shipment quality inspections to meet market standards.\n\nTo ensure transparency and quality control, the imports will be carried out solely through the TCP under government oversight. All duties and taxes on sugar imports have been waived to make sugar more affordable for the public and help alleviate inflationary pressure.\n\nThe committee conducted a comprehensive review of sugar availability, quality standards, import mechanisms, and price controls.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 10th, 2025",
