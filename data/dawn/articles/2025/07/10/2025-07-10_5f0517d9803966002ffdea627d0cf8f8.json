In previous verification drives, modifications were made to the existing rolls, Yadav said.\n\nNow, a list is being drawn from scratch.\n\nYadav said the drive was a “de facto” implementation of an earlier plan to put together a list of Indian citizens.\n\nThe National Register of Citizens (NRC), which was compiled in the eastern state of Assam in 2019, left out almost two million people. Many of them were Muslims.\n\nThe BJP had said the NRC would be replicated nationwide as it was necessary to detect “foreign infiltrators”, but was forced to backtrack after furious protests.\n\n“Everyone has to now prove that they are citizens of India,” said Yadav.\n\n“That is exactly what the NRC is… this is NRC by the backdoor. “",
