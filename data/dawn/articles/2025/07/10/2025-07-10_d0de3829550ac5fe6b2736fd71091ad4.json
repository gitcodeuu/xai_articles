The IED reportedly contained fuses, nails, and defusing mechanisms.\n\nThe officials say that the suspect intended to carry out some terrorist activity.\n\nFollowing the recovery of IED from the suspect, Civil Defense expert Muhammad Abid defused the device.\n\nCTD also seized Rs4,500 cash from the suspect.\n\nThe suspect has been booked under Sections 4 and 5 of the Explosive Act 1908 and Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 on the compliant of Azhar Hayat, an official of the CTD police station, Sahiwal.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 10th, 2025",
