Instead of paying, they took me to a room at the city police station, tortured me and kept me there for the entire night,” he said.\n\nForms probe body, seeks report in three days.\n\nThe complainant said that he was only released after providing a written assurance that he would not disclose what had happened to him. His motorbike was also seized by the police personnel.\n\nTaking notice of the incident, the DPO formed an inquiry committee headed by Superintendent of Police Resham Jehangir, directing it to submit a report within three days.\n\nBoth accused personnel were suspended and asked to report to the police lines.\n\n“I have zero tolerance for such incidents where citizens are subjected to inhuman treatment,” Mr Gandapur said, promising strict action under the law and police rules.\n\nHe said that he would ensure that no such incident happened in the future, as the protection of public life and property was the top priority of the police.\n\nPLANTATION: The tehsil municipal administration (TMA) has launched a monsoon tree plantation drive in Mansehra city and surrounding areas to promote a greener and healthier environment.\n\n“We aim to plant trees along main roads and in public parks as part of our monsoon plantation drive,” tehsil municipal officer (TMO) Mazhar Muzaffar Awan told reporters on Wednesday.\n\nThe campaign was formally launched with the planting of a sapling, after which Mr Awan urged members of civil society to actively participate in the drive for a hazard-free environment for future generations.\n\n“We will involve students and members of civil society to join hands with our field staff in planting saplings. Abrupt weather changes have significantly impacted lives in both urban and rural areas,” he said.\n\nMr Awan also encouraged residents to plant saplings not only at their homes and in their neighbourhoods but also along roadsides.\n\nLater, the TMO gave away appreciation certificates to employees over their outstanding performance. The event was attended by TMA staff members and heads of various departments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 10th, 2025",
