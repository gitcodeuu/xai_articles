As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah,” Naqvi added.\n\nEarlier today, PML-N Senator Irfan Siddiqui also denied reports of Zardari’s resignation.\n\nSpeaking on Geo News’ programme “Geo Pakistan”, he said: “Reports that Zardari is resigning, Imran’s sons are coming, Nawaz Sharif is going to Adiala … these are not news. They are bogus, table stories.”\n\nHe further said, “Zardari has not created any difficulties for the government, and understands his constitutional responsibilities as head of state”.\n\nThe PML-N leader said his party had “no trouble” working with the president, who leads the PPP, and there was no credible reason to remove him from office.\n\n“We have a coalition with the PPP. Why would we bring down this system?” he questioned.\n\nOver the past couple of years, social media campaigns against the army have escalated, reflecting broader tensions within the country’s political and social fabric.\n\nThe government, as well as the military, have repeatedly warned about “fake news and propaganda” proliferating on social media, with military spokesperson Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry saying that not enough was being done against “digital terrorism” under the laws.\n\nIn May, President Zardari and PM Shehbaz formally decorated Chief of Army Staff (COAS) Gen Syed Asim Munir with the rank of field marshal for his “sagacious leadership and exceptional strategy” during the recent conflict with India.\n\nIn a subsequent dinner hosted by the army chief, Field Marshal Munir lauded the political leadership for their “strategic foresight” during Marka-i-Haq against India.\n\nThe next month, Defence Minister Khawaja Asif, who belongs to PM Shehbaz’s PML-N, hailed the “existing hybrid model of governance” in the country. In a separate interview, he also termed it as a “practical necessity” for Pakistan, saying the system was “doing wonders”.\n\nIn May 2024, the army chief and President Zardari had expressed their concern over “baseless and unsubstantiated allegations levelled by a specific political party and its few individuals” against the army for their political interests.",
