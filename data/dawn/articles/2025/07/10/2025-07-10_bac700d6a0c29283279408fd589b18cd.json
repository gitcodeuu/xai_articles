He said the coming Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) would prioritise agricultural projects, focusing on mechanisation, digitisation, easy access to loans for farmers, and creating a business-friendly environment.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said sustainable agricultural reforms would boost the economy and reiterated the government’s commitment to an enhanced focus on reforming the livestock sector alongside agricultural commodities.\n\nHe said the federal and provincial governments would coordinate for implementation of agricultural reforms, calling for proposals to work out short-term and long-term strategies to enhance storage capacity for agricultural commodities.\n\nThe prime minister said progress in agriculture would primarily benefit farmers, emphasising collaboration among experts to develop the sector on modern lines.\n\nHe called for utilisation of agricultural zoning and value chain strategies to boost exports and introduce technology tailored to the needs of small landholders.\n\nProposals were presented to the prime minister for increasing agricultural production, improving infrastructure, establishing simple and sustainable regulations for a business-friendly environment, and ensuring easy access to loans for farmers.\n\nThe meeting was told that an “agriculture innovation and growth action plan”, focused on increasing farmers’ income, raising productivity and implementing reforms, was going ahead in the right direction.\n\nThe prime minister was told that measures were being taken to establish secure storage facilities for agricultural commodities.\n\nRecord remittances\n\nThe prime minister expressed satisfaction over record remittances received during the fiscal year 2024-25, saying that the government was committed to ushering in economic prosperity for all.\n\nThe prime minister observed that Pakistanis had sent remittances totalling $38.3 billion during the previous financial year, surpassing the tally for 2023-24 by $8bn.\n\n“The record surge in remittances reflects expatriate Pakistanis’ valuable contribution and their confidence in the national economy,” the PM observed.\n\nHe added that the recent positive economic indicators proved beyond doubt that the government’s policies were paying dividends.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 10th, 2025",
