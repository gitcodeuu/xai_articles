He cited the appearance of betting ads during international cricket matches and depictions of alcohol use in TV dramas as evidence of regulatory lapses.\n\nSenator Sarmad Ali highlighted the accessibility of gambling apps and proposed regulatory action by PTA or religious advisory mechanisms, along with the formation of a content monitoring body.\n\nThe committee members raised questions about the implementation of existing Pemra laws over such advertisements. Senator Pervaiz Rashid argued that penalties have failed to deter misconduct but cautioned against overregulation of cultural norms, especially for attire.\n\nSenator Afnan clarified that the legislation does not aim to target women. The committee decided to seek the opinion of the minister of information over the Prohibition of Unethical Advertisements Act.\n\nOn the Right of Access to Infor­m­a­tion (Amendment) Bill, Senator Za­­rqa Suharwardy Taimur expressed serious concern about government departments providing incomplete or selective data. The senator cited Scotland as a role model where public institutions ensure transparency and timely responses.\n\nThe committee also discussed ad­­ministrative matters of PTV and exa­­mined budget and staffing issues.\n\nThe ministry officials reported that Rs11bn annual budget had been exhausted, with Rs8.5bn consumed by salaries of the PTV staff alone.\n\nSenator Waqar Mehdi raised alarm over the illegal occupation of Radio Pakistan buildings in Karachi and electricity theft through unauthorised connections.\n\nHe called for inspections of Radio Pakistan properties outside Islamabad to assess conditions and prevent further encroachments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 10th, 2025",
