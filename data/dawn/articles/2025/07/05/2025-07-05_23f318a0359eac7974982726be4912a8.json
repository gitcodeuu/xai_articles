  "content": "PARIS: A strike by French air traffic controllers brought a second day of chaos to European skies on Friday, with flights for hundreds of thousands of people cancelled as the summer holiday season gathered pace.\n\nMore than 1,100 flights arriving or leaving France and hundreds that were to fly over the country were cancelled on Friday.\n\nParis airports were even more severely affected than on the first day of the strike on Thursday, which was called by two unions protesting against understaffing and “toxic management”.\n\nThe timing of the strike is particularly acute as Friday the was the final day of school in France before the summer holidays.\n\nAt Paris airports, passengers stared at departure boards loaded with cancellations to assess their options. Some travellers appeared distraught.\n\nSabrina Taristas, 42, was set to fly to the southern French city of Toulouse.\n\n“We can’t go against the strike, but it’s true that it’s a real inconvenience for us travellers,” she said.\n\nFrance’s civil aviation authority said 1,125 flights had been cancelled on Friday, compared to 933 on Thursday.French flag-carrier Air France said its long-haul flights were not affected. The travel disruption also affected hotels.\n\nMany travellers cancelled hotel bookings, particularly in cities with large airports such as Nice and Paris.\n\n“There’s a bit of panic among those arriving and those leaving, airlines are trying to rebook their customers, it’s complicated to manage and it’s going to cost them a lot,” Veronique Siegel of the UMIH union said.\n\nIn the Mediterranean city of Nice, the airport said 200 trips had been cancelled on Thursday, and 220 on Friday, affecting 50,000 passengers.The government condemned the strike.\n\n“Choosing the day when everyone goes on holiday to go on strike at air traffic control is taking the French hostage,” Prime Minister Francois Bayrou told broadcaster BFMTV.\n\n`Unacceptable’\n\nTransport Minister Philippe Tabarot said the strike was “unacceptable”.\n\n“Yesterday and today, 272 people in our country will impact the well-being of more than 500,000 people,” he told broadcaster CNews, referring to the number of the workers on strike.\n\nUNSA-ICNA, the second biggest labour group in the sector, launched the action to protest against “chronic understaffing”, the introduction of a clocking-in system, outdated equipment and “toxic management practices that are incompatible with the requirements of calm and safety”.\n\nThe third largest union, USAC-CGT, joined the strike but not the main SNCTA union.\n\nThe effects of the strike were not limited to France and the stoppage has triggered hundreds of cancellations of flights that fly over the country.\n\nThe European Airlines for Europe (A4E) association said 1,500 flights would be cancelled on Thursday and Friday in Europe, affecting 300,000 passengers.\n\nA4E chief Ourania Georgoutsakou said “the actions of a minority of French air traffic control workers” would “needlessly disrupt the holiday plans of thousands of people in France and across Europe”.­\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
