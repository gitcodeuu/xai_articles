  "content": "QUETTA: The father of a missing levies personnel on Friday demanded the immediate recovery of his son, who he says disappeared four days ago after reporting for duty in Mastung.\n\nSaeed Ahmed Abizai Dehwar said at a press conference that his son, Tanveer Ahmed Abizai Dehwar, a serving Levies official, went to work on July 1 and has not been heard from since.\n\nThe family’s distress is compounded by a mysterious letter circulating on social media suggesting his son had been fired weeks before he vanished.\n\n“Despite the passage of four days, we have no information about his whereabouts as he did not return home so far,” Mr Dehwar said, noting his son was performing his duties as a gunman for a judicial officer at the session court in Mastung.\n\nSays his son went to work on July 1 and hasn’t been heard ever since\n\nTanveer’s disappearance coincided with an armed attack in Mastung, the father said.\n\n“We tried our best to find Tanveer Ahmed but could not succeed,” Mr Dehwar said. “His cell phone is also off, and we have not received any information about him.”\n\nHe said the family filed a missing person report with the local police the next day and also contacted the Deputy Commissioner of Mastung and Levies Headquarters, but received no updates.\n\nThe family’s confusion turned to shock when they saw a letter, dated June 21 and purportedly issued by the Deputy Commissioner of Mastung, saying that Tanveer had been dismissed from service.\n\nSaeed Ahmed questioned the authenticity of the dismissal notice, which he said the family had never seen before his son went missing.\n\n“If my son had been officially terminated, how was he still on duty, in uniform, armed, and receiving a salary?” he asked.\n\n“He was neither served any notice nor instructed to stop reporting for duty. He continued his duties without any interruption.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
