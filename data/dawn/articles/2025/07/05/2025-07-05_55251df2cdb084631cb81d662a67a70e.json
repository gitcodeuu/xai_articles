Her health reportedly deteriorated at Camp 4, forcing her to abort the climb and begin her de­­s­­­cent with Nepali Sherpa Tara­man Tamang on Wednesday night.\n\nShe is believed to have slipped on a rocky section above Camp II and gone missing early Thursday morning.\n\nAccording to the expedition organisers, Seven Summit Treks, the Pakistan Army has deployed a helicopter to assist in the ongoing recovery efforts, which are being supported by the ground team and Ms Kolouchová’s family.\n\nIn a statement, the organisers said, “We would also like to clarify a misreport circulating in the media. It has been incorrectly stated that the fall was caused by the explosion of an oxygen bottle. This is not true. The loud sound heard was caused by an oxygen bottle striking a rock during the fall, which created a noise resembling an explosion.”\n\nIt added, “We kindly ask everyone to help disseminate accurate information and to respect the sen­­sitivity of this tragic situation.”\n\nMeanwhile, 11 climbers of the same expedition successfully summited Nanga Parbat on Thursday and Friday, making them the first team to reach the peak during Pakistan’s 2024 summer climbing season.\n\nThose who completed the summit include Pakistan’s Rana Has­san Javed and Ali Hassan, Paula Birgitta Strengell (Finl­and), Dor­ota Lidia Rasinska Sam­­ocko (Po­­land), Jorge Egoch­eaga (Spain), Allia Pepper (Aust­ralia) and five Nepali Sherpas. The climbers also fixed the route to the summit during their ascent.\n\nAlpine Club of Pakistan Vice President Karrar Haidri expres­sed sorrow over Ms Kolouchová’s presumed death. “We are deeply saddened by the tragic passing of renowned Czech mountaineer Klára Kolouchová,” he said. “She reportedly fell between Camp I and Camp II around 4am near Bunar Base Camp in Diamer, Gilgit-Baltistan.”\n\nHe added that authorities and rescue teams were immediately alerted and dispatched to the site. “Recovery efforts are underway to locate and retrieve her body,” he said.\n\nMs Kolouchová was a celebrated mountaineer, internationally recognised as the first Czech woman to summit both Mount Everest and K2. She arrived in Pakistan on June 15, accompanied by her husband and a five-member climbing team.\n\n“Our thoughts and prayers are with her family, friends and the global mountaineering community during this difficult time,” Mr Haidri said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
