  "content": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) has reverted to the previous eight-team format for the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, just a year after experimenting with an 18-team First-Class structure, Dawn has learnt\n\nWell-placed sources revealed that the decision was finalised during a meeting of the PCB’s domestic cricket committee held here on Friday.\n\nUnder the revised format, the top six regional teams from last year’s Quaid-i-Azam Trophy have earned direct qualification, while the remaining two spots will be filled by teams promoted through the second-tier Hanif Trophy, set to commence on August 15.\n\nFor the first time in the tournament’s history, no team from Karachi or Raw­alpindi has directly qualified for the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy. The six regions assured of a place in the competition are Lahore (one team), Islamabad, Abbottabad, Peshawar, Bahawalpur, and Sialkot.\n\nSources further revealed that committee members from lower-ranked regions, who had benefited from last year’s inclusive policy, expressed dissatisfaction over their exclusion from this season’s First-Class competition.\n\nThe 18-team format, introduced with the intention of broadening participation, was criticised for diluting the quality of competition and has now been scrapped.\n\nWhile changes in domestic cricket structures are not uncommon, such a swift reversal under the same PCB administration is rare.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
