  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan’s Chief Minister Mir Sarfraz Bugti said on Friday that his government plans to use artificial intelligence to tackle the “major challenge” of maintaining roads, especially in remote areas, as connectivity is crucial for development and resolving local issues of the people.\n\nChairing a meeting of the Communications and Works Department, the chief minister stressed an urgent need to move beyond traditional methods and adopt smart, digital solutions to improve connectivity for the public. “By leveraging modern technology, we can ensure transparent and efficient monitoring of development projects,” CM Bugti said.\n\n“The poor condition of roads causes severe hardships for the public, and it is therefore a top priority of the government to ensure the proper use of development funds and the sustainability of road infrastructure.”\n\nDuring the meeting, officials briefed Bugti on the structure and functionality proposed AI-based system.\n\nThey explained the system would use AI to assess road conditions and implement digital monitoring across remote regions, helping to facilitate timely repairs and ensure quality standards are met. CM Bugti said that the effective use of technology can help prevent the waste of financial resources.\n\n“Our goal is to ensure that every project aligns with public needs, meets quality standards, and is sustainable,” he asserted. “There will be no compromise on the durability, quality, or structure of road works.”\n\nThe CM directed the relevant departments to speed up consultations and submit recommendations to make the proposed AI system practical.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
