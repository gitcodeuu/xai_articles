  "content": "LAHORE: The Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Friday forecasted heavy rains across Punjab on ninth and tenth of Muharram (July 5 and 6).\n\nEarlier, the authority had predicted chances of heavy rain in various districts of Punjab from July 5.\n\nPDMA Director General Irfan Ali Kathia said the administration of Muharram processions should take safety measures, keeping in mind the weather intensity. He said distance should be maintained from electric poles and wires and holding gatherings on dilapidated roofs should be avoided while crossing of rivers and streams should be avoided as there was a risk of flooding in the mountainous areas of Dera Ghazi Khan. He said the residents of settlements on the banks of streams should take special precautions. Rescue agencies should be especially alert on 9th and 10th Muharram.\n\nMeanwhile, the PDMA’s latest rainfall data reveals that Faisalabad recorded the highest rainfall (33mm) in the past 24 hours, followed by Chakwal (26mm), Kot Addu (24mm) Toba Tek Singh (11mm), Sialkot and Sheikhopura (9 mm), Mandi Bahauddin (7 mm) and Hafizabad (5 mm). Other areas, including DG Khan, Sagodha, Noorpur Thal, Bahawalpur and Multan reported minimal precipitation.\n\nEarlier, Relief Commissioner Punjab Nabeel Javed issued instructions to the commissioners and deputy commissioners across the province to remain alert in view of the monsoon rains. He said that all relevant institutions including PDMA Punjab, Wasa, Rescue should be on alert.\n\nAll relevant institutions should complete advance arrangements. Drainage of water from low-lying areas along the routes of processions should be made possible as soon as possible.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
