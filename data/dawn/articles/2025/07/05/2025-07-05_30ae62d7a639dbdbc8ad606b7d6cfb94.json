Militant attacks have become more frequent in recent months, despite ongoing efforts by local peace committees to maintain order and resist terrorist influence.\n\nLast week, the leader of a peace committee and two of his companions were shot dead by terrorists in Lakki Marwat district.\n\nEarlier in June, three terrorists were killed in the district’s Kot Kashmir area during a gun battle with the police and local peace committee, in which a cop was also martyred.",
