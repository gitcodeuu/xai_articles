Sources close to Corbyn indicated frustration with the timing of Sultana’s decision, describing it as potentially “premature.”\n\nStill, Corbyn acknowledged ongoing discussions about forming a new political organisation. Speaking on ITV’s Peston, he said: “That grouping [of independents] will come together, there will be an alternative.”\n\nWhile he declined to label it a party or confirm a leadership role for himself, he reaffirmed a commitment to a political movement centred on “peace rather than war,” tackling poverty and inequality.\n\nThe pair’s new initiative has drawn comparisons to rising progressive movements abroad. Economist Richard D. Wolff tweeted: “A new political left is rising… in the US, Sanders-AOC-Mamdani, and in the UK now Corbyn-Zarah Sultana. Finally!”\n\nHowever, some questioned her focus, accusing her of neglecting local issues in Coventry.\n\n‘Collective leadership’\n\nCorbyn, who led Labour from 2015 to 2020 before being suspended in a row over antisemitism, has been cautious about titles, preferring collective leadership. The new group, which includes MPs Shockat Adam, Ayoub Khan, Adnan Hussain, and Iqbal Mohamed, now matches Reform UK and the DUP in parliamentary numbers, and outpaces the Greens and Plaid Cymru.\n\nLast September, Corbyn attended a closed meeting to discuss launching a new party called Collective, intended to challenge Labour’s centrist turn under Keir Starmer.\n\nIn an opinion piece, Guardian columnist Andy Beckett noted that Sultana is usually “one of the most effective political communicators” in the UK.\n\n“She has more followers on TikTok than any MP except Nigel Farage. Unlike him, she has an ability to talk with moral force and clarity: about Palestine, inequality, the rightward shift of the government and other issues particularly important to Britain’s large minority of left-wing voters, a neglected electoral bloc since Corbyn’s Labour leadership ended in 2020.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
