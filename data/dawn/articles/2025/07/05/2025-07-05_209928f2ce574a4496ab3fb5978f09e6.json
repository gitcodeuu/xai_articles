  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) has taken serious notice of officials in various sports federations holding positions beyond the permissible two terms, in violation of the National Sports Policy 2005.\n\nThe PSB has issued warning letters to nine office-bearers from different federations who have exceeded the allowed tenure limits, according to a press release issued by the Board.\n\nAs per the press release, the federations found in violation include the Pakistan Baseball Federation, where the president, secretary, and treasurer have continued in office beyond the prescribed terms; the Pakistan Taekwondo Federation and the Pakistan Judo Federation, where both the presidents and secretaries have overstayed their tenure; and the Pakistan Sailing Federation and the Pakistan Karate Federation, whose secretary generals are also continuing in office beyond the permitted limit.\n\nThe PSB termed these cases a clear violation of the National Sports Policy.\n\nThe letters warn that failure to rectify these violations within 30 days may result in the withdrawal of PSB-related benefits, including eligibility for government grants and official support, the press release stated.\n\nPSB spokesperson Khurram Shahzad said the warning letters underscore that under Clause 10(a)(5) of the National Sports Policy 2005, the tenure of any office-bearer of a federation or association is limited to four years, with a maximum of two terms in any single position.\n\nHe added that once two terms are completed, the individual becomes ineligible to continue in the same office within that federation or association. However, such individuals may contest for a higher position or seek office in another association at any time.\n\nThe PSB also cited a ruling of the Supreme Court of Pakistan which, according to the Board, upheld the validity of the policy and stated that any sports body seeking affiliation with the PSB and wishing to benefit from its support must fully comply with the National Sports Policy.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 5th, 2025",
