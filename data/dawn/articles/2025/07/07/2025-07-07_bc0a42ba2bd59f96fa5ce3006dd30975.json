Three students, who were declared severely injured, were safely transported to the Civil Hospital in Madyan.”\n\nIn another incident, he said a man was killed while four others sustained injuries when a three-wheeler plunged into a deep ravine after its brakes failed. The driver died on the spot, Khan said.\n\nFatal accidents are common on roads in the mountainous regions of the country due to traffic rule violations, treacherous terrain, and poor infrastructure.\n\nEarlier this month, six members of a family were killed in Azad Jammu and Kashmir when their car veered off the road and plummeted hundreds of feet, crashing onto the right bank of the Neelum River, officials said.\n\nThe accident occurred at a sharp bend on the Neelum Valley road near Chilyana village, approximately 50 kilometres northeast of Muzaffarabad.\n\nOn June 25, four people were killed and two injured in separate road accidents.\n\nRahimabad police said a passenger bus collided with a car travelling to Buner near the Odigram area, resulting in the deaths of Altaf Rehman, Yasir Khan and Fida Mohammad, residents of the Deewana Baba Degar area of Buner. Khalil Zada, a resident of Gagra Buner, was injured in the accident.\n\nMeanwhile, two motorcycles collided in the Malaki Dam area of Barikot, resulting in the death of one rider and injuries to another. The injured individuals from both accidents were transferred to local hospitals for treatment.",
