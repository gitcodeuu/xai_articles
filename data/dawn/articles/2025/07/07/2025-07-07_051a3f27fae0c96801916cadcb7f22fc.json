  "content": "The International Cricket Council on Monday named Sanjog Gupta as its new chief executive officer, a senior official at India’s key broadcaster of the game.\n\nGupta, the ICC’s seventh CEO, succeeds Geoff Allardice, who resigned from the post in January after four years in office.\n\nGupta was broadcaster JioStar’s chief executive for sports and live experiences.\n\nICC chairman Jay Shah said Gupta “brings extensive experience in sports strategy and commercialisation, which will be invaluable for the ICC”.\n\nThe role attracted more than 2,500 applications from candidates across 25 countries, the ICC said.\n\n“These are exciting times for the sport as marquee events grow in stature, commercial avenues widen and opportunities such as the women’s game scale in popularity,” Gupta said in a statement.\n\n“Cricket’s inclusion in the Los Angeles 2028 Olympic Games and the rapid acceleration of technology deployment/adoption could act as force-multipliers for the cricket movement around the world,” he said.\n\nAccording to the ICC’s website, Gupta was appointed as the JioStar Sports CEO in November 2024 and has “held multiple leadership roles in content, programming and strategy”. He began his career as a journalist in 2010 at Star India (now JioStar).\n\n“Under his stewardship, the sports portfolio at Star India scaled across consumer and commercial objectives with a strong emphasis on long-term growth and operational efficiency,” the ICC highlighted.\n\nGupta has played a “crucial role in developing and executing multi-language, digital-first, and women-centric sports coverage”, it added.",
