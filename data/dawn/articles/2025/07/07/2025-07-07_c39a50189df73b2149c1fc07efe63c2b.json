Terrorists in Balochistan, previously engaged in a low-level insurgency, have recently intensified their attacks. The banned Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA) emerged as a key perpetrator of terrorist violence in Pakistan in 2024.\n\n“Three personnel were injured in a blast targeting a patrolling vehicle of the highway police in Nasirabad’s Rabbi area,” Highway Police’s Senior Superintendent of Police Khadim Husain said.\n\nHe added that the incident took place when the highway police team was patrolling the area as per routine.\n\nCiting preliminary reports, Husain said the blast was conducted through a remote-controlled device. The injured were immediately taken to a hospital in the Dera Murad Jamali town, located 12km from Rabbi, the SSP added.\n\n“The police have initiated an investigation,” SSP Husain said.\n\nIn June, Pakistan witnessed a slight overall decline in militant violence during June 2025 despite several high-profile attacks, according to data released by an Islamabad-based think tank, Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (Picss).\n\nOver a week ago, security forces killed two terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Duki district.\n\nEarlier this month, security forces eliminated two “India-backed” terrorists after an attack on government offices in the Mastung district killed a teenager and injured seven others.\n\nOn June 21, two personnel of the Frontier Corps were martyred and four were injured in a bomb attack in Kalat’s Mongochar area. In a separate attack in Kalat, a CTD officer was gunned down by unknown armed men, while a police official was among two killed in Mastung.\n\nIn May, four people were injured when unidentified motorcyclists threw a grenade at a house in Nasirabad. In March, Nasirabad police claimed to have foiled a sabotage attempt ahead of the Pakistan Day celebrations and seized explosives.",
