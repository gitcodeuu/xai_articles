The food prices rebounded to a positive trend after a decline in four consecutive months.\n\nIn urban areas, the food items whose prices saw the month-on-month increase in June included tomatoes (57.33pc), potatoes (25.74pc), onions (15.26pc), eggs (8.82pc), gur (2.75pc), rice (1.67pc), wheat flour (1.53pc), sugar (1.52pc), fresh fruits (1.38pc), milk powder (0.78pc), milk fresh (0.40pc) and milk products (0.35pc).\n\nA statement posted on Dar’s X account said he chaired a meeting today to review the domestic situation of essential commodities and food items.\n\n“The DPM/FM emphasised the need for a coordinated policy approach to ensure market stability. He reaffirmed the government’s commitment to safeguarding the interests of both consumers and producers through proactive planning, effective oversight, and inter-agency collaboration.”\n\nThe discussions focused on supply and demand dynamics, pricing trends and measures to ensure the stable availability of essential food items in the market, the statement said.\n\nThe meeting was attended by Commerce Minister Jam Kamal Khan, Special Assistant to Prime Minister Tariq Bajwa, the commerce secretary and other senior officials from the associated ministries and departments.\n\nIn March, Dar said that retail sugar prices should not exceed Rs164 after the Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) warned sugar mills against price manipulation. Dar said that according to news reports, there was a spike in sugar prices to Rs178 -179, which was “obviously not tolerable” to the prime minister.\n\nThe CCP stated in March that it has been actively working to curb cartelisation in the sugar industry, promoting fair competition and protecting consumers.",
