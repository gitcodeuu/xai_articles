  "content": "United States President Donald Trump’s administration has revoked the foreign terrorist organisation designation for Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, according to a State Department memo filed on Monday, a major step as Washington moves to ease sanctions on Syria.\n\nThe memo dated June 23 was signed by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and was published in a preview of the Federal Register before official publication on Tuesday.\n\nThe move comes a week after Trump signed an executive order terminating a US sanctions programme on Syria, to help end the country’s isolation from the international financial system and build on Washington’s pledge to help it rebuild after a devastating civil war.\n\n“In consultation with the attorney general and the secretary of the Treasury, I hereby revoke the designation of Al-Nusrah Front, also known as Hayat Tahrir Al-Sham (and other aliases) as a Foreign Terrorist Organisation,” Rubio wrote in the memo.\n\nHayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, was previously Al-Qaeda’s Syria branch. In December, Syrian President Ahmed al-Sharaa led the HTS, which, together with other rebels, conducted a lightning offensive that ousted Syria’s former president Bashar Al-Assad.\n\nSharaa’s HTS severed Al-Qaeda ties years ago and says it wants to build an inclusive and democratic Syria.\n\nSyria’s foreign ministry had no immediate comment.\n\nSharaa and Trump met in Riyadh in May, where, in a major policy shift, Trump unexpectedly announced he would lift US sanctions on Syria, prompting Washington to significantly ease its measures.",
