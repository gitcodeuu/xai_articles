BJP-ruled states have since rounded up thousands of Bengali Muslims, calling them suspected “illegal immigrants” and a potential security risk.\n\nAnalysts say the deteriorating New Delhi-Dhaka relations post-Sheikh Hasina’s ouster have heightened anti-Bengali Muslim sentiments, providing the BJP a political tool for votes.\n\n“Bengali-speaking Muslims, regardless of their legal status, have become vulnerable targets for right-wing groups in India,” said Praveen Donthi, senior analyst at International Crisis Group.\n\n‘Discriminatory policies’\n\nIndian opposition leaders have accused Sarma of using the evictions and expulsions to polarise voters ahead of elections.\n\n“These measures are politically beneficial and profitable for the BJP,” said Akhil Gogoi, an opposition lawmaker.\n\nThe opposition Congress party, defeated in the 2016 Assam election, pledged to rebuild demolished houses and jail those responsible if re-elected. According to Reuters, Bengali is the main language of Muslim-majority Bangladesh and is also widely spoken in parts of India.\n\nStates including Assam have also “pushed back” hundreds of Bengali Muslims into Bangladesh.\n\nSuch people are typically long-term residents with families and land, and activists say many of them are often wrongly classified as foreigners and are too poor to challenge tribunal judgments.\n\nNew Delhi said in 2016 that around 20 million illegal Bangladeshi migrants were living in India.\n\n“The Indian government is putting thousands of vulnerable people at risk in apparent pursuit of unauthorised immigrants, but their actions reflect broader discriminatory policies against Muslims,” said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 29th, 2025",
