He said that all bunkers established by the Shia and Sunni communities had been vacated.\n\nHe said an air offensive had been launched for the first time since the Kohat Peace Accord was inked on January 4, 2025, following the killing of innocent passengers travelling on the Kohat-Kurram Highway in November 2024.\n\nMr Marwat said during the last 10 days 15 hardened terrorists had been killed in Hangu, Karak, Orakzai and Kurram districts.\n\nIt may be recalled that two separate convoys of vehicles escorted by police were ambushed in November 2024, which ignited sectarian violence.
