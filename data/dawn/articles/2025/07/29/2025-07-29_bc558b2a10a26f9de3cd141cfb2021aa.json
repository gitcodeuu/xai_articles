  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Amid a persistent surge in sugar prices, the government on Monday decided to enforce strict monitoring of sugar stocks and deploy officials at each sugar mill to oversee inventory levels and ensure uninterrupted supply in line with commitments made by the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA).\n\nThe move comes as part of broader efforts to curb hoarding and restore market stability. A grievance redressal committee has also been established to improve coordination and resolve disputes. At the same time, a dedicated WhatsApp group will be created for real-time communication between government officials and mill representatives.\n\nThe decision was taken during a meeting chaired by Minister for National Food Security Rana Tan­v­eer Hussain, who met with representatives of the PSMA and other stakeholders from across the provinces to assess the current sugar supply situation.\n\nIt was observed that several sugar mills were not adhering to the agreed-upon framework regarding the release of sugar into the market. Despite repeated assurances, delays in dispatch and inconsistent availability continue to fuel concerns over price stability.\n\nThe PSMA chairman highlighted various operational challenges faced by mill owners, prompting the minister to offer assurances of support. “The government is committed to maintaining price stability and ensuring adequate sugar availability. Any negligence or breach of agreement will not be tolerated. However, we will also address legitimate concerns of the industry,” Mr Tanveer said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 29th, 2025",
