The two had been on the run since the incident, which occurred on July 21 and sparked widespread outrage across the region.\n\nAccording to the police, the child was brutally tortured to death at the madressah, allegedly by multiple individuals, including teachers.\n\nThe disturbing incident led to the immediate arrest of 10 suspects from the site. However, the principal accused managed to flee, prompting an intensive manhunt.\n\nDPO Umar said the arrest of Qari Umar and his son was the result of “tireless efforts” by the Swat police. “Justice will be ensured, and all individuals involved in this heinous act will be brought to justice,” he stated.\n\nThe murder triggered strong public reaction, with citizens and rights activists demanding accountability and stricter oversight of unregistered seminaries in the region. Authorities have since reiterated their commitment to safeguarding children’s rights and preventing future abuse in religious institutions.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 29th, 2025",
