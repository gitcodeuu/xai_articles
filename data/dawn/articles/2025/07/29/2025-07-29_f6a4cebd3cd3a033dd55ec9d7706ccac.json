  "content": "LAHORE: The Lahore High Court on Monday sought a detailed report from the advocate general of Punjab regarding the cutting of trees for the proposed Yellow Line Train Project along the Canal Road.\n\nWhile hearing multiple identical petitions regarding smog control and other environmental issues, Justice Shahid Karim directed the principal law officer of the province to inform the court about the tree-felling activities related to the project at the next hearing.\n\nThe judge also summoned the director general of the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa) to appear in person, along with information on the ongoing development works.\n\nJustice Karim observed that all Wasa-related works should have been completed before the monsoon season.\n\nA counsel for the Wasa informed the court that their works had been completed and that the remaining ones were in the domain of the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) or Traffic Engineering and Transport Planning Agency (Tepa).\n\nThe judge ordered that the enforcement of the one-way traffic rule should be ensured on service lanes of The Mall, Jail Road, and Gulberg’s Main Boulevard.\n\nThe judge observed that the vehicles’ smoke testing should not be limited to cars only, but should also include motorcycles and heavy vehicles. The judge also sought a plan from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regarding heavy traffic and motorcycles.\n\n“The government has established such a large enforcement force but no one knows what actual work they are doing,” the judge remarked.\n\nJustice Karim observed that it was not the court’s job to keep following up on every matter.\n\nThe judge adjourned the further hearing till Aug 1.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 29th, 2025",
