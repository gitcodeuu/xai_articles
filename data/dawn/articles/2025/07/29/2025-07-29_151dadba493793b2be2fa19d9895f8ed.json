They also criticised the government for pursuing legislation on a matter currently under review in the Balochistan High Court and called it the contempt of court.\n\nPlanning and Development Minister Zahoor Buledi denied there were any plans to merge the Levies Force with the police. He clarified that the bill seeks to convert B-Areas into A-Areas and proposes the merger of Federal Levies into Balochistan Levies Force as per 18th Amendment. He urged committee members to submit their suggestions and assured that the bill remains open to amendments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 29th, 2025",
