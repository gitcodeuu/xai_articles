  "content": "KARACHI: In a rare show of unity, the treasury and opposition benches in the Sindh Assembly joined hands against a decision of the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra), which approved the multi-year tariff of K-Electric (KE) and allowed it to recover Rs50 billion in write-off losses from consumers via their electricity bills over the coming years.\n\nMuttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan’s (MQM-P) Amir Siddiqui presented a resolution, demanding that Nepra immediately withdraw its decision and urging the provincial government to take all necessary legal and administrative measures “to protect Karachi’s citizens.”\n\nFully supporting the opposition’s resolution, Senior Minister Sharjeel Memon said that the Constitution did not allow electricity distribution companies in Sindh to give collective punishment to consumers. “We cannot remain silent on this issue,” he said.\n\nThe lawmakers will discuss the resolution on Tuesday (today) before unanimously adopting it.\n\nTreasury supports opposition MQM-P resolution; debate today\n\nThe resolution states: “This House expresses grave concern over Nepra’s decision allowing K-Electric to recover approximately Rs50 billion in write-off losses through consumer electricity bills over the coming years.”\n\nThe mover of the resolution said that losses resulting from the power utility’s inefficiencies, power theft, and line losses were being unfairly passed on to bill-paying citizens while areas with chronic non-payment and electricity theft had been exempted from the recovery.\n\nThe resolution also urged that an independent audit of KE’s claimed losses be conducted and that a transparent and equitable framework be developed to prevent such exploitative recoveries in the future.\n\nThe MQM-P lawmaker said that Nepra did not have the right to punish an entire area for the theft committed by one person.\n\nSharjeel Memon said that this was not only the problem with KE as Hyderabad Electric Supply Company and Sukkur Electric Power Company were also engaging in similar practices. “These institutions impose collective punishment on the people, although the Constitution of our country does not allow it,” he added.\n\nMr Memon said it was the responsibility of the provincial government to protect the rights of its people. “We support this resolution,” he said.\n\nLaw and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Zia-ul-Hassan Lanjar suggested that the resolution be discussed on Tuesday.\n\nDeputy Speaker Anthony Naveed ruled that the resolution would be discussed on Tuesday (today). Later, the house was adjourned till Tuesday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 29th, 2025",
