They are aged 13 to 18 and hail from all over France, the PNAT said.\n\nLawyers and magistrates told AFP these teens are usually boys with no delinquent past, many of whom are introverts or have had family trouble.\n\nThe PNAT opened a special branch in May to better examine the profiles of minors drawn into “terrorism”, but it said it has already noticed they are all “great users of social media”.\n\n“Most are fans of ultra-violent, war or pornographic content,” it said.\n\nIn France, “terrorism” is largely synonymous with extremist ideas such as those of the militant Islamic State group (IS).\n\nOnly in recent months has the PNAT taken on cases different in nature — one an adult suspected of a racist far-right killing, and the other an 18-year-old charged with developing a misogynist plot to kill women.\n\nA 14-year-old schoolboy who stabbed to death a teaching assistant in June was a fan of “violent video games”, although his case was not deemed “terrorist” in nature.\n\nIn the case of France’s youngest “terror” suspects, a judicial source told AFP, social media provides them with a flow of violent videos that are “not necessarily linked to terrorism”, such as from Latin American cartels.\n\n“They think they’re proving themselves as men by watching them,” the source said.\n\nSociologist Farhad Khosrokhavar said the teens were “neither children nor adults”.\n\nThis “leads them to violence in order to be recognised as adults — even if it’s a negative adult”, he said.\n\nLaurene Renaut, a researcher looking into extremist circles online, said social media algorithms could suck adolescents in fast.\n\n“In less than three hours on TikTok, you can find yourself in an algorithm bubble dedicated” to IS, she said.\n\nYou can be bathing in “war chants, decapitations, AI reconstructions” of past actions or even simulations of actions to come, she said.\n\nThe algorithms feed users “melancholic” content to boost their “feeling of loneliness, with ravaged landscapes, supposed to reflect the soul”, she said.\n\nOne such teenager said he was motivated by a sense of “injustice” after seeing a video online of an attack on a mosque in New Zealand.\n\nWhite supremacist Brenton Tarrant went on a rampage, killing 51 worshippers at mosques around Christchurch in March 2019 in the country’s deadliest modern-day mass shooting.\n\nThe French suspect was convicted last year for planning “terror” attacks on far-right bars.\n\nHe told investigators it started when he was 13 and playing Minecraft, a video game, on gamer social media platform Discord.\n\n“Someone sent Tarrant’s video,” he said. “I thought it was unjust to see the men, women and children be massacred.”\n\n“I then watched the videos of imams telling people to stay calm and those of terrorists from the far right, and I thought it was unjust,” he added.\n\nA French appeals court in July 2024 sentenced him to four years in jail, including two suspended, after he contacted an undercover agent to find out about weapons.\n\nThe court justified the sentence with the “gravity” of his planned actions, but noted he lacked signs of “deeply rooted ideological radicalisation”.\n\nRather, it said, the defendant was the child of fighting parents from a very violent neighbourhood, who had been “significantly deprived of affection” and had sought to “fit in” with internet users.\n\nHis lawyer Jean-Baptiste Riolacci told AFP he was an “essentially lonely, sad and good kid, whose only occupation beyond his computer was gliding around on his scooter”.\n\nThe judicial source, who spoke anonymously due to the sensitivity of the issue, said the French system favoured early intervention through charging youth for associating with “terrorist” criminals, and then adapting their punishment according to the severity of the accusations.\n\nBut attorney Pierre-Henri Baert, who defended another teenager, said the system did not work.\n\nHis client was handed three years behind bars in May for sharing an IS propaganda post calling for attacks against Jewish people as a 16-year-old.\n\n“It’s a very harsh sentence considering his very young age, the fact he had no [criminal] record, and was really in the end just accused of statements online,” he said.\n\nAnother lawyer, who worked on similar cases but asked to remain anonymous due to the sensitivity of the issue, agreed.\n\n“When the judiciary goes after people for terrorist criminal association, it’s basically doing guesswork,” she said, adding that the “terrorist” label could be very stigmatising.\n\n“There’s no differentiation between a kid who sent aggressive messages and a suspect who actually bought weapons,” she added.\n\nTwo judicial sources said teens prosecuted for alleged “terrorism” are usually only spotted through their behaviour on social media.\n\nThey are then charged over other actions, such as moving to an encrypted messaging app, sharing recipes to make explosives or looking for funding, the sources said.\n\nA Paris court will in September try three teenagers who, aged 14 and 15, allegedly planned to blow up a truck outside the Israeli embassy in Belgium.\n\nThey had been spotted at high school for their “radical remarks”, but were then found in a park with “bottles of hydrochloric acid” containing “aluminium foil”, a homemade type of explosive, the PNAT said.\n\nTheir telephones showed they had watched videos of massacres.\n\nJennifer Cambla, a lawyer who represents one of the defendants, said accusations against her client were disproportionate.\n\n“My client may have had the behaviour of a radicalised person […]. But he is far from having plotted an attack,” she said.\n\nBut another lawyer, speaking anonymously, said arresting teenagers “fantasising” about extremism could be an opportunity to turn their lives around — even if it involved “a monstrous shock”.\n\n“The arrests are tough,” with specialised forces in ski masks pulling sacks over the suspect’s head, they said.\n\nBut “as minors, they are followed closely, they see therapists. They are not allowed on social media, and they do sports again,” the lawyer said.\n\nOne of the judicial sources warned that it was not clear that this worked.\n\nIt “makes it look like they are being rapidly deradicalised, but we do not know if these youth could again be drawn in by extremist ideas”, the source said.",
