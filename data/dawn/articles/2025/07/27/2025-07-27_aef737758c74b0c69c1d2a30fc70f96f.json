When law enforcement personnel moved in, the suspects opened fire, prompting a retaliatory response. All three militants were killed in the ensuing exchange.\n\nAmong the deceased was Ajmal alias Waqas, a resident of Malook Abad, wanted in at least nine terrorism-related cases. The second was identified as Matiullah alias Ishaq and Junaid, son of Ibrat Shah from Dabb Sar Martung in Shangla district, wanted in two cases.\n\nThe third, Rahimullah Rehmani alias Rohullah, son of Amanullah and a resident of Sheray, Nuristan, in Afghanistan, was also wanted in two separate terrorism cases.\n\nSwat District Police Officer (DPO) Muhammad Umar Khan told reporters that search and strike operations would continue across the district.\n\nHe added that security had been intensified at all entry and exit points to prevent the infiltration of miscreants. “We will not allow the peace and stability of Swat to be disturbed at any cost,” he said.\n\nMilitant killed by own accomplices\n\nIn a separate incident in Kohat district, an alleged militant involved in an earlier attack on the Hangu DPO was killed on Friday night, reportedly by fire from his own group during a police operation.\n\nThe militant, identified as Shahzeb, had previously escaped after being injured during an attack on the Hangu DPO’s convoy last Saturday. DPO Khalid Khan and SHO Nabi Khan were injured in the attack. Shahzeb was later arrested near Naryab Dam within the Doaba police jurisdiction.\n\nDuring interrogation, he revealed the presence of militant commander Umer alias Abu Bakr in the area. Acting on this intelligence, police from Doaba and Thall tehsils launched an operation towards Tora Warai, where they were again ambushed.\n\nSHO Doaba Imranud Din, who was transferred from Kohat a few days ago, and his team engaged the militants in a two-hour gun battle. During the exchange, Shahzeb was fatally struck by a bullet allegedly fired by his accomplices.\n\nKarak operation\n\nIn Karak, an alleged militant was killed during an exchange of fire with police in the Shah Slaim area on Saturday.\n\nA police official said a team assisted by CTD commandos was dispatched after intelligence reports indicated that a group of militants was heading towards the Abbas Khattak area in Lakki Marwat district.\n\nDuring a search operation in Shah Slaim, security forces encountered the group, resulting in a fierce gun battle.\n\n“The gunfight continued for some time before the terrorists fled into difficult mountainous terrain,” he claimed.\n\nDuring the subsequent search, police recovered the body of a militant identified as Fidaullah, a resident of Nagri.\n\n“The cops also seized an assault rifle, two hand grenades, magazines and ammunition from the place and shifted the terrorist’s body to a nearby hospital,” the police official added.\n\nThe official said that the killed militant was involved in various sabotage activities, including the Friday’s militant attack in the Koh-i-Maidan area in which a police constable Saeed Nawaz was martyred.\n\nHe said that police also destroyed the hideouts of militants in a separate action.\n\n“The police, with the help of CTD personnel, launched a search and strike operation against the gang of terrorists led by Sanaullah Jalali and Attaullah,” he maintained, claiming that the group has been involved in launching attacks on law enforcement personnel in the Karak district.\n\nHe said that, along with destroying safe havens in the mountains, the law enforcers also cut off the supply line of the militants.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 27th, 2025",
