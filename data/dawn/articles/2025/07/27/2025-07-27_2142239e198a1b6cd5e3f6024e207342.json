Eventually, they found her lifeless body in dense shrubs about half a kilometre away.\n\n“The leopard had reportedly bitten her neck, drained her blood and then left the body in the bushes before disappearing into the nearby forest,” the official said.\n\nThe horrifying attack has left the entire community in shock, forcing many villagers to remain indoors out of fear of another possible encounter with the wild animal.\n\nFuneral prayers for Javeria will be held in Nalai at 11am on Sunday.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 27th, 2025",
