  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Iranian embassy has issued an advisory for pilgrims intending to visit Iran and Iraq on for the Arbaeen pilgrimage, to mark the 40th day of mourning for the martyrdom of Imam Hussein (RA).\n\nThe embassy has asked Pakistani pilgrims to register for the Arbaeen pilgrimage visa through Iran’s electronic visa portal by August 7.\n\nThe guidelines have referred to the recent tripartite meeting of the interior ministers of Iran, Pakistan and Iraq, that all pilgrims must possess a valid Iraqi Arbaeen e-visa prior to entering Iraq. This measure is intended to prevent difficulties caused by crowd congestion at border entry points.\n\nAccording to the statement, the government of Iran, in cooperation with its diplomatic and consular missions in Pakistan and the government of Pakistan, has made arrangements for the pilgrimage.\n\nTour organisers have been directed to observe the new guidelines, the statement said adding from July 26 to August 10, those pilgrims with a valid Iraqi Arbaeen visa will be eligible to receive a free double-entry Iranian Arbaeen visa along with a half-rate travel insurance, enabling them to travel through Iran by land en route to Iraq.\n\nAfter August 10, the Arbaeen e-visa option will no longer be available.\n\nSubject to the consent of Pakistan and the tour operators, the border crossings of Mirjaveh-Taftan and Rimdan-Gabd, will be operational for group travel by bus in accordance with previously issued technical regulations, it added.\n\nThe tour operator managers must submit details of transport vehicles, ‘Carnet de Passage’ (vehicle passport) documents, international driving licenses of the drivers, and a complete list of pilgrims. Entry through these borders will only be permitted after verification of the passenger list and vehicle registration plates, it added.\n\nTour operators have been directed to comply with the border and customs regulations of Iran, including adherence to the allowed number of passengers and ensuring that no prohibited goods or medicines are transported.\n\nThe statement added Pakistani pilgrims who obtain the Iranian Arbaeen pilgrimage visa must enter Iran by Aug 14, and they are required to proceed to Iraq only through the Chazzabeh (Al-Shayeb) border crossing. They must return via the same route. “Use of any other border crossing is not permitted,” it said. In cases where a caravan intends to send pilgrims to Iran via air travel, it is mandatory to present flight tickets showing Iraq as the destination.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 27th, 2025",
