It’s a good deal for everybody,” Trump told reporters after talks with von der Leyen at his golf resort in Turnberry, Scotland. The EU chief also hailed it as a “good deal”.\n\nEarlier, the US president told reporters he felt the two sides had a 50-50 chance of a deal with the European Union. The bloc faces an across-the-board US levy of 30 per cent unless it strikes a trade pact by August 1.\n\nWashington warned on Sunday there would be “no extensions” and Trump confirmed “the deals all start on August 1”.\n\nVon der Leyen’s European Commission, negotiating on behalf of EU countries, is pushing hard for a deal to salvage a trading relationship worth an annual $1.9 trillion in goods and services.\n\nThe EU chief said at the start of the talks at Trump’s luxury golf resort in southwestern Turnberry that if they reached a deal, “I think it would be the biggest deal each of us has ever” made.\n\nAccording to an EU diplomat briefed ahead of the meeting, the contours of a deal are in place, but key issues still need settling.\n\n“A political deal is on the table — but it needs the sign-off from Trump, who wants to negotiate this down to the very last moment,” the diplomat told AFP.\n\nThe proposal, they said, involves a baseline levy of around 15pc on EU exports to the United States — the level secured by Japan — with carve-outs for critical sectors including aircraft and spirits, though not for wine.\n\nAny deal will also need to be approved by EU member states, whose ambassadors, on a visit to Greenland, were updated by the commission Sunday morning. They would meet again after any accord.\n\nAccording to the EU diplomat, the 27 countries broadly endorsed the deal as envisaged — while recalling their negotiating red lines.\n\nThe Trump-von der Leyen meeting was taking place in the president’s luxury golf resort in Turnberry on Scotland’s southwestern coast. The 79-year-old Trump said on Friday he hoped to strike “the biggest deal of them all” with the EU.\n\nThe EU is focused on getting a deal to avoid sweeping tariffs that would further harm its sluggish economy — while holding out retaliation as a last resort.\n\nUnder the proposal described to AFP, the EU would commit to ramping up purchases of US liquefied natural gas, along with other investment pledges. Pharmaceuticals, a key export for Ireland, would also face a 15pc levy, as would semiconductors.\n\nThe EU also appears to have secured a compromise on steel that could allow a certain quota into the United States before tariffs would apply, the diplomat said. But Trump said on Sunday that trade tariffs with the EU would not be lower than 15pc.\n\nThe EU has been hit by multiple waves of tariffs since Trump reclaimed the White House. It is currently subject to a 25pc levy on cars, 50pc on steel and aluminium, and an across-the-board tariff of 10pc, which Washington threatens to hike to 30pc in a no-deal scenario.\n\nIt was unclear how the proposed deal would impact tariff levels on the auto industry, crucial for France and Germany. Carmakers are already reeling from the levies imposed so far.\n\nWhile 15pc would be much higher than pre-existing US tariffs on European goods, which average around 4.8pc, it would mirror the status quo, with companies currently facing an additional flat rate of 10pc.\n\nShould talks fail, EU states have greenlit counter tariffs on $109 billion (€93bn) of US goods, including aircraft and cars, to take effect in stages from August 7.\n\nBrussels is also drawing up a list of US services to potentially target.\n\nBeyond that, countries including France say Brussels should not be afraid to deploy a so-called trade “bazooka” — EU legislation designed to counter coercion that can involve restricting access to its market and public contracts.\n\nBut such a step would mark a major escalation with Washington.\n\nTrump has embarked on a campaign to reshape US trade with the world, and has vowed to hit dozens of countries with punitive tariffs if they do not reach a pact with Washington by August 1.\n\nUS Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Sunday the August 1 deadline was firm and there will be “no extensions, no more grace periods.”\n\nPolls suggest, however, that the American public is unconvinced by the White House strategy, with a recent Gallup survey showing his approval rating at 37pc, down 10 points from January.\n\nHaving promised “90 deals in 90 days,” Trump’s administration has so far unveiled five, including with Britain, Japan and the Philippines.",
