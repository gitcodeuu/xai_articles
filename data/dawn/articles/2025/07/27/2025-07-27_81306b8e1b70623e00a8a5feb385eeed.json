More than 21 million devotees took part in the pilgrimage last year.\n\nPakistan is set to introduce a new travel management system from Jan 1, 2026, under which pilgrims will only be allowed to undertake the journey under registered organisers.\n\nUnder the new measures, the traditional Salar System will be abolished and replaced with a Zaireen Group Organisers model. Alongside weekly flights to Iran being increased from six to 15, 107 additional special flights will also be arranged for pilgrims heading to Iraq.\n\nEarlier this month, Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousuf retracted his statement that 40,000 pilgrims had not returned from trips to Iran and Iraq. He clarified that a “misunderstanding” of outdated paper records that had not yet been fully digitised resulted in the statement.\n\nDuring their meeting, PM Shehbaz and Naqvi also discussed the law and order situation in Balochistan, with the premier telling the minister to initiate work on the Gwadar Safe City project.\n\nThe project aims to provide a safer city for the residents of Gwadar, particularly at the identified strategic locations and also help law enforcement agencies in detecting and investigating crimes by collecting evidence.\n\nThe delay in the project had been highlighted by Senator Quratulain Marri in May as she chaired a meeting of the Senate Standing Committee on Planning, Development and Special Initiatives.\n\nSenator Marri had sought a report on a critical discrepancy — the Gwadar Development Authority officials blamed a lack of funds for the project delays, while the Finance Division said it had received no funding demand from the Balochistan government.\n\nOn July 11, a representative of the Balochistan government told a high-level government meeting that 30 per cent of the project was complete, with full completion expected by June 2026.\n\nWith the initial plan prepared in 2016, the first phase of the Gwadar Safe City project had been approved by the Central Development Working Party in February 2023 for Rs4.97bn.\n\nPakistan International Airlines (PIA) announced to operate special flights for billions of pilgrims. according to the airline’s spokesperson.\n\nFour flights will depart from Karachi from August 8 to 11, the announcement said.\n\nFlights for pilgrims returning from Najaf have been scheduled from August 18 to 21.\n\nTicket sales have started for all flights, the statement added.\n\n“More flights will also be scheduled based on market demand,” the spokesperson said.",
