  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh health department on Saturday reported the province’s first dengue-related death of the current year in the metropolis.\n\nAccording to officials, the female patient was under treatment at a private hospital. She passed away on Friday.\n\nThey said that she was 48 years old and a resident of district East.\n\n“The patient was admitted to the hospital on July 23 and tested positive for dengue the same day. She also had underlying health conditions, including diabetes and a urinary tract infection, which contributed to complications in her case,” says a press statement.\n\nOver 400 cases reported across province\n\nSo far, over 400 cases of the mosquito-borne viral infection have been reported across the province, with the majority emerging from Karachi.\n\nThe department has urged citizens to take preventive measures, including using mosquito repellents and ensuring regular fumigation in homes.\n\nAccording to experts, there is no specific treatment for the illness, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue.\n\n“Most people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in one to two weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death. If symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include high fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pains, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands and rash,” according to the WHO website.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 27th, 2025",
