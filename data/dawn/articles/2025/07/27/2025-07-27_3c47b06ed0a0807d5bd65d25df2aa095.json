They could not present their licences or certificates and admitted that they were not qualified doctors but were hired by hospital owner, Aslam Hayat, to perform surgeries.\n\nAccording to the FIR, there was no qualified doctor posted in the hospital. Aslam also did not have any degree or licence. The case was registered against five people, including Aslam, who fled the hospital. Two of them had been arrested.\n\nAccording to health sources, the illegal hospital had been sealed and all the patients were shifted to the DHQ hospital by Rescue 1122.\n\nThe sources said the hospital had been operational for about 15 years and it had been raided and sealed several times by the health department in the past but it would get desealed after paying a small fine.\n\nA senior health official posted at the DHQ told Dawn there were dozens of private hospitals across the district, including Bahawalnagar, Minchinabad, Fort Abbas, Chishtian, and Haroonabad, which had no qualified doctors.\n\nKILLED: Two men were arrested while eight were booked for a double murder and injuring three others over a dispute in the Bakhshan Khan police area.\n\nThe FIR registered with Bakhshan Khan police stated that two months ago, Tajammul of Mauza Miro Baloch was grazing his buffaloes when they entered the cotton fields of Waseem Jhubail of Basti Jhubail, which led to a bitter argument between Waseem and Tajamal.\n\nLater, the panchayat made them reconcile with each other. On July 25, Waseem and his seven accomplices attacked Tajammul’s father Fayyaz and uncles, Nawaz, Mumtaz, Ayaz and Riaz, and opened fire on them injuring them all. During the scuffle Ayaz was killed.\n\nThe police said the injured were shifte4d to the THQ hospital where Nawaz succumbed to his injuries. Mumtaz was shifted to the BVH Bahawalpur due to his critical condition. Police said the two suspects had been arrested while raids were being conducted to arrest others.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 27th, 2025",
