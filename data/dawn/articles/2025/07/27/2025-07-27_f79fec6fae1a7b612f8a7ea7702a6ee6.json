It emerges from the sea and attacks Japan in a rage, symbolising the deadly power of nuclear weapons.\n\n“I think because he came from such a historic event — like, a lot of other monsters are just interesting creatures, but they don’t hold the grief of a nation,” Hill said, referring to the US nuclear bomb attacks against Hiroshima and Nagasaki in World War II.\n\nAt the pop culture watering hole in San Diego, people lined up to shoot pictures and video with an image of Godzilla, which was also the theme of a panel discussion on Friday that featured Shinji Higuchi, who co-directed a reboot in 2016 called “Shin Godzilla.”\n\nThe movie franchise includes nearly 40 films and has spawned hundreds of animated productions about the monster as well as TV series and graphic work.\n\nOn Saturday, writers Ed Godziszewski and Steve Ryfle signed autographs of their book Godzilla: The First 70 Years, which sold out at Comic-Con.\n\n“It’s a rich history,” Ryfle told AFP. “This is the longest-running feature film franchise in cinematic history that’s focused on a single, continuous character. It’s been around longer than James Bond.”\n\nHe said the key to its longevity is that Godzilla has evolved over time but stayed faithful to its origins.\n\n“Godzilla has been serious, it’s been scary, it’s been heroic, it’s been funny. But at the same time, this is a movie character that’s rooted in something that’s very real,” Ryfle said.\n\n“And that’s the trauma that Japan experienced, both during World War II, and also the trauma of the aftermath of World War II, the aftermath of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,” he added.\n\nHe said Honda, who directed the first Godzilla movie, was a veteran who used the film to send a message against war and, in particular, against nuclear weapons.\n\nMichelle Pena, a Godzilla fan who waited in line to get the autograph of the two writers, said part of the monster’s charm is how it has changed over the years.\n\n“Good, bad, hero, anti-hero, you know. And I like that,” she said.\n\n“He’s not, like, lovable,” she added. “He’s a big dinosaur-looking thing, you know. He’s scary. But, like, you really, really find yourself rooting for him.”",
