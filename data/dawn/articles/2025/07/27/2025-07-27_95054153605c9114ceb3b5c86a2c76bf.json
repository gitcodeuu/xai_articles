For McLaren, it was a 10th win this year.\n\nCharles Leclerc came a solid third for Ferrari ahead of four-time champion Max Verstappen of Red Bull, under the race leadership of new team boss Laurent Mekies for the first time, and Mercedes’ George Russell.\n\nAlex Albon clung on to finish sixth for Williams ahead of chasing seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton of Ferrari, who started from the pit lane, and Racing Bulls’ rookie Liam Lawson.\n\nGabriel Botoleto was ninth for Sauber ahead of Pierre Gasly of Alpine.\n\n“That was lively!” said the cool Piastri, who swept past Norris on lap one.\n\n“Very lively. I knew that lap one was probably my best chance of winning the race. I lifted a little as I went through Eau Rouge, and then it was enough.\n\n“The rest of the race we managed really well. Maybe the medium wasn’t the best in the last five-six laps, but we had it almost under control! I was disappointed after yesterday, but it turns out that starting second was not too bad.”\n\nNorris conceded he couldn’t have won.\n\n“Oscar just did a good job — there’s nothing much more to say. He was committed a bit more in Eau Rouge and that was it. Oscar deserved it today.”\n\nLeclerc said: “Max was behind me all race within two seconds, so it’s never easy. I knew the first part was the trickiest, and I’m pretty happy we managed to keep that third place.”\n\nThe race began, after an 80-minute delay due to heavy rain, with the entire field on intermediates to run for four laps behind a safety car, clearing standing water.\n\nFour drivers started from the pitlane — Carlos Sainz, Fernando Alonso, Kimi Antonelli and Lewis Hamilton — having made changes to their power units or set-up overnight. They began at the rear of the field ahead of the rolling start at the start of lap five.\n\nAs the lights went green, Norris powered away to lead through La Source, but he was unable to resist when Piastri sneaked out of his slipstream to take the lead going into Les Combes chicane.\n\n“Why do I have no pack?” asked Norris, realising he lacked electric power. “We used a lot on the safety car re-start,” McLaren responded.\n\nOn lap 12, Hamilton was the first in for medium slick tyres, rejoining 18th, followed by Piastri, Leclerc, Verstappen, Russell and more. Norris stayed out one lap longer for hards, hoping to profit if his rival’s rubber degraded in the closing laps. He was the only one.\n\nBy lap 15, everyone else had switched to mediums and it was Piastri on top ahead of Norris by 9.3 with Leclerc third leading Verstappen, Russell, Albon and… in flying form, Hamilton.\n\nAs Norris closed in, Piastri said his tyres were already degrading. “I think it will be tough to get to the end,” he told race engineer Tom Stallard, raising the prospect of a dramatic finale.\n\nOn lap 26, Norris slid wide at Puhon, falling back to nine seconds adrift before remounting his charge. It was a process of marginal gains as Piastri managed his tyres.\n\nNorris was close but Piastri’s craft and calm prevailed.",
