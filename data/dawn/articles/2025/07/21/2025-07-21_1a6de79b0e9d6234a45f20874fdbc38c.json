The spillways of Rawal Dam were opened on Sunday morning after the water level touched 1748 feet.\n\nAn official of the Punjab Irrigation Department said sirens were sounded before the spillways were opened to alert people residing along the Korang Nullah.\n\nFurther release of waterfrom reservoir is expected today, subject to clear weather conditions, says DC Rawalpindi\n\nDeputy Commissioner Dr Hassan Waqar Cheema told Dawn that the dam had filled for the first time this season and that it would ensure an adequate water supply to Rawalpindi until the winter.\n\n“The spillways will be opened again on Monday to reduce one foot of water in the lake, but in case of rainfall in the morning the spillways will not be opened. We have asked the Small Dam Organisation to open the spillways when the weather is clear. During rain, the water level in Leh Nullah and Soan River increases.” He said the district administration was informed that the authorities will reduce one more foot of water in the dam.\n\nOn the other hand, the meteorological department predicted partly cloudy/humid weather with rain/thundershower expected in Islamabad and surrounding areas. Heavy rain is likely during night hours.\n\nA Met official said moist currents from Arabian Sea were penetrating in southern parts of the country and likely to approach upper parts on Sunday night. “A low pressure area is also present over Sindh and adjoining areas of Balochistan. A trough of westerly wave is likely to approach upper parts from tomorrow,” he said.\n\nHe said rain-wind/thundershower was expected in Kashmir, upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Islamabad, northeast Punjab, Potohar region, Gilgit-Baltistan, northeast/south Balochistan and south Sindh. Isolated heavy rain is expected in upper Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Potohar region, Kashmir and adjoining hilly areas. Hot and humid weather is likely elsewhere in the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 21st, 2025",
