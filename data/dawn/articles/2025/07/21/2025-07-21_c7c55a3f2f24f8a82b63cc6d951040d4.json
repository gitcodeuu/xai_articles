He said the party would also launch a countrywide tree plantation campaign during the monsoon season as directed by former prime minister and PTI founding chairman Imran Khan.\n\nWhile informing the media about the decisions taken at the meeting, PTI farmers’ wing information secretary Khalid Nawaz Sudhraich said that district-level office-bearers of the wing and representatives of farmers’ organisations attended the meeting.\n\nHe said the British rule on the country was over on August 14, 1947, but the mindset and the system that exploited the people during their rule still persisted.\n\n“The three-pronged move­ment’s objectives set by the meeting included release of Imran Khan from detention, abolishing anti-agriculture policies of the government, and conducting large-scale tree plantation drive during the current monsoon season,” he said.\n\nMr Sudhraich said that PTI farmers wing and its affiliated organisations were asked to participate in the movement seeking Imran’s release from jail on the Independence Day and continue the struggle for the rule of law and supremacy of the Constitution in the country.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 21st, 2025",
