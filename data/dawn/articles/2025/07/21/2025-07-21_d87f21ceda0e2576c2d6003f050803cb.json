This means 369 votes will be available for the Senate election. To secure victory, a candidate must obtain at least 185 votes (184.5 to be exact).\n\nHowever, the ruling coalition, comprising the PML-N, PPP, Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party, and the PML-Q, holds a clear majority.\n\nIt currently commands the support of 261 votes, comprising 229 from the PML-N, 16 from the PPP, 11 from the PML-Q, seven from the IPP, and one from the PML-Z.\n\nIn contrast, the opposition alliance holds a total of 108 votes, with 76 from the Sunni Ittehad Council, 27 from the PTI, and one each from the Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pak­istan and the Majlis Wahdat-i-Musli­meen.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 21st, 2025",
