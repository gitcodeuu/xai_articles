A shootout ensued [which] resulted in the killing of held suspect by his group’s fire during the chaos,” it added.\n\n“Two armed terrorists were also neutralised on the spot.”\n\nThe statement also read that the group was involved in “targeted killings and extortion networks, using child abductions to fund militant operations”.\n\nThe CTD recovered “a cache of weapons, explosive materials, communication devices, and extremist literature from the site”, according to the statement.\n\nA first information report was being registered at the CTD Quetta police station, while more raids were also planned for other areas of Dasht and Spilinji “to nab the remaining members of the group”, it concluded.\n\nPakistan ranked second in the Global Terrorism Index 2025, with the number of deaths in terrorist attacks rising by 45 per cent over the past year to 1,081.\n\nOn Friday, a Balochistan Constabulary acting deputy superintendent of police (DSP) and a constable were martyred and two others suffered injuries when unidentified gunmen opened fire on their vehicle on the National Highway in Mastung.\n\nFaced with increasing attacks by militants, especially in KP and Balochistan, security forces have also intensified counterterrorism operations.\n\nLast week, the CTD Balochistan killed five terrorists during a joint operation conducted with other law enforcement agencies in Duki district.\n\nSecurity forces killed four terrorists during an operation in Balochistan’s Kalat district on Sunday.",
