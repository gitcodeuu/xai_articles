For women-led enterprises, the minimum requirement is two permanent employees.\n\nBusinesses must also be bank-certified and operational for at least three years.\n\nMoreover, skilled individuals would receive support of up to Rs500,000.\n\nAdditionally, a support of up to Rs5 million is available for businesses involved in livestock, essential infrastructure, mining, construction services and machinery procurement, on the condition that they create employment and expand operations.\n\nThe QCCI representatives said due to low literacy rates and strict banking conditions, many people in Balochistan cannot benefit from such initiatives.\n\nThey requested support for online application procedures to expand businesses and create job opportunities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 21st, 2025",
