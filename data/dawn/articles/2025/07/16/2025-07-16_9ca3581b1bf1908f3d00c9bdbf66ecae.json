Among the flagship initiatives is the Chief Minister’s Youth Skill Development and Over­seas Employment Progra­mme, under which 30,000 skilled individuals from the province are being sent abroad for employment.\n\n“This initiative will not only enable Balochistan’s youth to access better employment opportunities but will also help boost the country’s foreign exchange reserves,” the adviser said.\n\nHe also highlighted the vital role played by institutions such as the Baloch­istan Technical Education and Vocational Training Authority, tec­h­nical training centres, and polytechnic colleges in providing training across a ran­ge of trades and skill sets.\n\nMr Umrani encouraged the youth to take advantage of these opportunities, noting that skills are the key to success in today’s competitive world.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 16th, 2025",
