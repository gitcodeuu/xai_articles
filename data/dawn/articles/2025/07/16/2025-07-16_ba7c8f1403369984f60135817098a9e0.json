  "content": "LAHORE: In a major development to deal with housing insecurity and promote social welfare, the Punjab government on Tuesday released Rs42.013 billion for its flagship ’Apni Chat Apna Ghar’ initiative.\n\nThe allocation, released under the 2025-26 Annual Development Programme, marks the single-largest investment by the provincial government towards interest-free housing support in the province’s history.\n\nAccording to a Planning & Development Board official, the funds have been released to the Punjab Housing and Town Planning Agency (PHATA) to support the scheme’s expansion under the urban development sector. This development follows an earlier proposal submitted by the Housing, Urban Development & Public Health Engineering Department (HUD&PHED), highlighting the scheme’s growing impact and demand.\n\nLaunched in August 2024, the ‘Apni Chat Apna Ghar’ programme offers interest-free loans of up to Rs1.5 million to individuals for constructing homes on their own land. Since its inception, over 51,911 families have benefited from the initiative, with 6,160 housing units already completed and occupied, and another 45,163 units under construction across Punjab.\n\nChief Minister Maryam Nawaz chaired a high-level meeting to review the scheme’s progress, where she was briefed by the housing secretary. The CM directed the authorities to accelerate both loan disbursements and the processing of new applications, emphasising the importance of timely support to deserving citizens.\n\n“This initiative is not just about brick and mortar. It is about restoring dignity and providing stability to families who have long lived in uncertainty,” said Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz. “Each home built is a testament to the state’s success and a realisation of Quaid Nawaz Sharif’s vision - development, protection, and facilitation of the common citizen.”\n\nOn the occasion, Housing Secretary Noorul Amin Mengal said the application process has been simplified and digitalised to improve accessibility. “We have ensured that there are no area-based restrictions. Any eligible citizen from anywhere in Punjab can apply and receive support,” he said.\n\nHe said the beneficiaries range from daily wage earners and gardeners to widows, food stall vendors, peons and small shopkeepers. “These are people who had the dream of home ownership but lacked the financial means to realise it.”\n\nTo date, more than Rs60.5bn have been disbursed through the scheme, including previously released funds, with the new Rs42bn injection set to significantly ramp up its outreach and impact.\n\nTerming the project “a new beginning” for underprivileged families, Maryam Nawaz said: “The day a poor family gets a roof over their head is the day the state fulfills its responsibility. Traditional politics has ended; now is the time for public service.”\n\nWith the release of this latest grant, the Punjab government has reinforced its commitment to pro-people governance and inclusive development. As the scheme gathers momentum, ‘Apni Chat Apna Ghar’ continues to emerge as a beacon of hope for thousands across the province - converting the dream of a secure home into a tangible reality.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 16th, 2025",
