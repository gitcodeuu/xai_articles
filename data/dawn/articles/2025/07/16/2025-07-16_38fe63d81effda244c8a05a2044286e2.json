It is also tied into lengthy contracts with independent power producers, including some owned by China, for which it pays a fixed amount regardless of actual demand.\n\nA government report in March said the solar power increase has created a “disproportionate financial burden on grid consumers, contributing to higher electricity tariffs and undermining the sustainability of the energy sector”.\n\nElectricity sales dropped 2.8pc year-on-year in June, marking a second consecutive year of decline.\n\nLast month, the government imposed a new 10pc tax on all imported solar, while the energy ministry has proposed slashing the rate at which it buys excess solar energy from consumers.\n\n“The household solar boom was a response to a crisis, not the cause of it,” said analyst Jones, warning of “substantial problems for the grid”, including a surge during evenings when solar users who cannot store energy return to traditional power.\n\nThe national grid is losing paying customers like businessman Arsalan Arif.\n\nA third of his income was spent on electricity bills at his Karachi home until he bought a 10-kilowatt solar panel for around Rs1.4 million (around $4,900).\n\n“Before, I didn’t follow a timetable. I was always disrupted by the power outages,” he told AFP.\n\nNow he has “freedom and certainty” to continue his catering business.\n\nIn Sialkot, safety wear manufacturer Hammad Noor switched to solar power in 2023, calling it his “best business decision”, breaking even in 18 months and now saving Rs1m every month.\n\nThe cost of converting Noor’s second factory has now risen by nearly Rs1.5m under the new government tax.\n\n“The tax imposed is unfair and gives an advantage to big businesses over smaller ones,” he said.\n\n“Policymakers seem completely disconnected from the public and business community.”\n\nHeader Image: Technicians install solar panels on the rooftop of a factory in Karachi, on July 2, 2025. — AFP",
