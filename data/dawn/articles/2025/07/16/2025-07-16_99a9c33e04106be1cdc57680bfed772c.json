  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Finally, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has made changes to the eligibility criteria for awarding contract of Shaheen Chowk construction — making some flexibility in rules to allow more companies to apply.\n\nEarlier, the CDA had introduced stringent criteria for the said project worth Rs1.3 billion, which resulted in just one firm applying for the project.\n\nHowever, the lone bidder was rejected after CDA opened the technical bid of the project on Friday.\n\nLater, the civic agency made changes to the eligibility criteria, stating that any company, which had carried out work worth Rs1.5 billion within 180 days during the last five years will get qualification marks of experience instead of previously announced tough criteria of 100 days.\n\n“We have changed the rules/criteria regarding work experience and now we are hopeful that a number of companies will apply to promote healthy competition,” a CDA official said.\n\nThe civic body had recently been criticised for introducing stringent criteria, which suited only a few firms. The CDA had already floated the new tender with amendments to rules related to work experience. The tender would be reopened on July 28.\n\nAs per procedure, the CDA first opens technical bids and after a few days of evaluation process, it goes for opening the financial bid before awarding work orders.\n\nThe lone bidder on Friday mobilised his machinery towards the project site on the same day to do test bore work, as being lone firm, its management thought that they would surely be awarded the contract. However, the CDA rejected the bid and opted for a new tender, which will be opened on July 28.\n\nUnder this project, the CDA will construct an underpass at the junction of Khayaban-i-Iqbal and 9th Avenue. According to documents, the project is supposed to be completed in 180 days.\n\nIt is relevant to note here that the CDA had also introduced such criteria for Serena Interchange, which was later named ‘Jinnah Square Interchange’, and the F-8 interchange, as it wanted to get these projects completed on an “urgent basis”.\n\nHowever, issues surfaced in both these projects — the design of the F-8 interchange is still questionable, while the Jinnah Square interchange faced drainage issues.\n\nWhen contacted, a senior CDA officer confirmed to Dawn that working experience criteria had been changed and now any company, which had completed the project worth Rs1.5 billion in six months, will also be given work experience marks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 16th, 2025",
