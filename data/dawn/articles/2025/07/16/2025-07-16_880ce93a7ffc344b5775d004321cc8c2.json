  "content": "MOSCOW: An American who spied on Ukrainian troops to help Moscow’s military offensive in the country has been granted Russian citizenship, Moscow-installed authorities said on Tuesday.\n\nDaniel Martindale spent two years in Ukraine after Russia launched its offensive, transmitting coordinates of military facilities to Russia’s secret services, according to reports in Russian state media.\n\n“By decree of our President Vladimir Putin, a passport of a citizen of the Russian Federation was awarded to Daniel Martindale,” Denis Pushilin, the head of the Russian-occupied part of Ukraine’s Donetsk region said on Telegram.\n\nPushilin said that Martindale had “long since proven with his loyalty and actions that he is one of us.” “He spent more than two years in the territory under enemy control. And not only did he survive — he helped. He supported our guys, passed on important information to our special services, risked his life,” he added.\n\nMartindale received his passport from interior ministry officials at a ceremony in Moscow, according to state media and a video published by Pushilin. Martindale thanked Russia for “accepting me”, and said becoming a Russian citizen was a “dream”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 16th, 2025",
