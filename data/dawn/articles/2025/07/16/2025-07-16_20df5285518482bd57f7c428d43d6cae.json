He especially regretted the incident in Swat, emphasising the need to take effective measures in the future to prevent such incidents.\n\nMons­oon rains in Pakistan have been linked to more than 110 deaths, including dozens of children, since they started in late June, according to government figures released on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Asif Ali Zardari and PM Shehbaz reiterated their commitment to working together with each other for the country’s sake.\n\n“The meeting involved discussions on the country’s political, economic, and security situation. The state of law and order in the country and measures against terrorism were also discussed,” according to a press release by the Presidency.\n\nLast week, PM Shehbaz said that transforming the outdated system into a modern, digital and effective governance model is among the government’s top priorities, as economic development and prosperity are not possible without modernising the system to meet contemporary demands.\n\nThe federal cabinet approved a 15 per cent increase in pensions provided by the Employees’ Old-Age Benefits Institution (EOBI), effective from January 1, 2025, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported.\n\nThis increase will be funded from the institution’s own resources, according to APP.\n\nThe prime minister directed the formation of a cabinet committee to introduce institutional reforms in EOBI.\n\nThe committee will also deliberate on proposals to extend old-age benefits to the informal labour sector, including domestic workers, agricultural labourers, and other marginalised employment categories that have been previously overlooked.\n\nThese reforms aim to ensure that workers in these neglected sectors receive their due rights.\n\nThe cabinet also approved the initiation of necessary legal procedures regarding the draft of the Sea Carriage Shipping Documents Bill 2025, on the recommendation of the Ministry of Maritime Affairs.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Ministry of National Health Services, the cabinet approved a five-year extension of the exemption on the import of anti-cancer, cardiac, and life-saving drugs used in hospitals and related healthcare institutions.\n\nThese medicines are considered vital for saving human lives, and the exemption is intended to ensure their prompt availability.\n\nThese drugs will be available only in hospitals and authorised institutions, with a ban on open market sales. Import of these medicines will require prior approval from the relevant licensing authority.\n\nThe federal cabinet also endorsed the decisions made in the meetings of the Cabinet Committee on Legislative Cases held on July 2 and 3.",
