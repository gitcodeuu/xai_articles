Inside these swirling discs, crystalline minerals that contain the chemical silicon monoxide can clump together.\n\nThis process can snowball into kilometre-sized “planetesimals”, which one day grow into full planets.\n\nIn our home Solar System, the crystalline minerals that were the starter dough for Earth and Jupiter’s core are believed to have been trapped in ancient meteorites.\n\nNow astronomers have spotted signs that suggest these hot minerals are starting to solidify in the disc surrounding HOPS-315, according to a new study in the journal Nature.\n\n“For the first time, we have identified the earliest moment when planet formation is initiated around a star other than our Sun,” lead study author Melissa McClure of Leiden University in the Netherlands said in a statement.\n\nThe minerals around the star were first spotted by the James Webb Space Telescope. Then the astronomers used the European Southern Observatory’s Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) telescope in Chile to find out exactly where the chemical signals were coming from.\n\nThey discovered that these minerals are in a small portion of the disc, which is similar to the asteroid belt that surrounds our Sun.\n\nThis will allow scientists to watch the process that may have birthed our home planet.\n\n“We’re seeing a system that looks like what our Solar System looked like when it was just beginning to form,” said study co-author Merel van’t Hoff of Purdue University in the US.",
