Meanwhile, an update from the EdhI Foundation rescue service put the number of injured at 10, saying they were taken to Civil Hospital Quetta for treatment.\n\n“Security agencies, district administration and rescue teams have immediately reached the scene. Security forces have surrounded the area and a search operation is underway. Security forces are pursuing the attackers,” Rind said.\n\nSpeaking to Geo News, he said Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti had taken notice of the incident and sought a report from police and law enforcement agencies.\n\n“Based on initial info, terrorists were sitting in ambush, they stopped the bus and then attacked. We cannot confirm the number of terrorists, but it was carried out from both sides of the road,” Rind said.\n\nState broadcaster PTV also posted a video of a passenger who said the terrorists had indiscriminately fired at the bus.\n\nIt also shared a statement from security sources that said: “Ever since the security forces started successful operations against the terrorists of Fitna-Al-Hindustan and the FC (Frontier Corps) sealed the border, cutting off their smuggling income, these cowardly terrorists, in a state of frustration, are targeting the lives of innocent people.\n\n“One of the two reasons for terrorist attacks on passenger buses on highways is that they are soft targets. The second reason is that by carrying out such incidents, they want to divert the army and FC from the border and operation areas to these locations so that the terrorists can operate more easily in the border and operation areas.”\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari ordered the provision of immediate and the best medical services to the injured.\n\n“Targeting innocent civilians is an extremely cruel and condemnable act. Terrorists aim to sabotage peace and stability, they are enemies of humanity and peace. With the support of the nation, we will completely eradicate the scourge of terrorism. The state will continue to take action against terrorism with full force.”\n\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi condemned the shooting in Kalat in a statement from his office, extending his condolences and assailing Fitna-Al-Hindustan — a term the government uses for terrorist organisations in Balo­chistan — for targeting civilians.\n\n“The targeting of innocent passengers by Fitna-Al-Hindustan terrorists is a very cowardly act,” he was quoted as saying. “These terrorists are hatching a heinous conspiracy to sabotage peace by targeting soft targets. With the support of the nation, we will foil these conspiracies by Indian-sponsored terrorists.”\n\n“The attack on the passenger coach in Qalat is a cowardly and despicable act of terrorism. The loss of precious lives is an irreparable tragedy. The terrorist organisations of Fitna-Al-Hindustan have previously carried out attacks based on identity, but now they are indiscriminately targeting civilians, which clearly shows that this war is against every ordinary Pakistani, and we will defeat it at all costs!” CM Bugti said in a post on X.\n\nNational Assembly Speaker Ayaz Sadiq said that “terrorists of the Indian conspiracy are targeting peace and stability.”\n\nHe said the cowardly attack was the “worst example of enmity against humanity”. “We will foil every conspiracy sponsored by India,” he said.\n\nSenate Chairman Yousuf Raza Gilani termed terrorists the “murderers of all humanity”.\n\n“Terrorists can never succeed in their nefarious objectives. The entire nation is united against terrorism.”\n\nSindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah also condemned the incident.\n\n“Targeting innocent passengers is a very barbaric act. Terrorists are a plague on the nation’s soil,” he said, adding that it was necessary to eliminate such elements for the country’s prosperity.\n\nPPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman said targeting innocent and defenceless civilians was a “heinous act”.\n\n“The state must take decisive and robust action against terrorists. The entire nation and security institutions are united in the fight against terrorism … The government must bring terrorists and their facilitators to justice and deliver exemplary punishment,” she said.\n\nPPP MNA and spokesperson Shazia Marri said such incidents went against Baloch traditions.\n\n“Innocent and unarmed people are being killed on foreign instigation; these people do not deserve any leniency. Elements involved in terrorism in Balochistan should be dealt with firmly and decisively.\n\n“The nation is united against the terrorists of Fitna-Al-Hindustan. The cowardly actions of terrorists are increasing; the federal and provincial governments should suppress such elements.”\n\nThe incident comes a week after at least nine passengers travelling on two Punjab-bound coaches were abducted and killed by unidentified armed men in the Sur-Dakai area, situated on the border between Balochistan’s Zhob and Loralai districts.\n\nThe government had said that Fitna-Al-Hindu­stan had carried out attacks at three different places — Kakat, Mastung and Sur-Dakai.\n\nThe Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said it had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.\n\nAccording to sources, two passenger coaches en route to Punjab were intercepted in the Sur-Dakai area near the N-70 highway, close to Dab — a place along the Loralai-Zhob border. A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.\n\nThe armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint. “They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger had told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”\n\nAfter abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area. According to sources, the attackers had checked the national identity cards of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.\n\nIn May this year, the government designated all terrorist organisations in Balochistan as Fitna-Al-Hindu­stan.\n\nIn March, five people were killed by armed men who blocked the highway in the Kalmat area of Gwadar district, while three long-body trailers carrying urea from Gwadar port were set on fire in the Tajaban area.\n\nIn February, seven Punjab-bound passengers were offloaded from a bus and shot dead in Barkhan district. The incident came days after 12 were killed in a blast targeting a bus carrying coal miners in Harnai.\n\nBalochistan has witnessed a spate of attacks targeting those hailing from Punjab. In two separate incidents in April 2024, nine people were killed after being forced off a bus near Noshki, while two labourers from Punjab were shot in Kech.\n\nIn May last year, seven barbers from Punjab were shot dead near Gwadar, while August saw 23 travellers offloaded from trucks and buses and shot in the Musakhail district.\n\nThe Musakhail incident was part of a flare-up of violence, where dozens of militants affiliated with the banned Balochistan Liberation Army — a separatist outfit — launched numerous attacks across Balochistan, targeting security personnel as well as civilians.\n\nSeparately, the Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) said security forces conducted an intelligence-based operation in Awaran district today based on the reported presence of Fitna-Al-Hindustan terrorists.\n\n“During the conduct of operation, own troops effectively engaged the terrorist location and, resultantly, three Indian-sponsored terrorists were sent to hell.”\n\nHowever, the ISPR said that 34-year-old Major Syed Rabnawaz Tariq from Muzaffarabad district was martyred during the intense fire exchange while leading his troops from the front.\n\n“Sanitisation operation is being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian-sponsored terrorism from the country, and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR said.\n\nThe interior minister praised the martyr and said his sacrifice would not go in vain while paying tribute to him.\n\nA roadside bomb also exploded in Quetta’s Hazar Ganji area, leaving three women injured. Shalkot police Station House Officer (SHO) Khair Muhammad Samalani told Dawn.com that a bomb planted in a motorcycle was remotely detonated near Murree Camp.\n\n“Immediately after the explosion, police and security agencies surrounded the area and the process of collecting evidence began,” the SHO said, adding that no group claimed responsibility.\n\n“The injured women were immediately transported to Civil Hospital Quetta for medical treatment,” he stated, adding that their condition was said to be “out of danger”.\n\nSHO Samalani added that police and bomb disposal personnel launched search operations at the scene to avert any other potential threats.\n\nAdditional reporting by Imtiaz Ali.",
