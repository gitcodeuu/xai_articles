  "content": "MOHMAND: In a groundbreaking move to foster a culture of reading and intellectual growth among youth, the Mohmand Students Union (MSU) has inaugurated the first-ever open-access mini library at Nahqi Tunnel Park in collaboration with the District Youth Office.\n\nThis unique library, established in a public park and accessible to all, is part of a larger vision by MSU to promote education, literacy and community engagement.\n\nThe initiative is named after late Shaheed Maulana Khanzeb, a respected figure who was a passionate advocate for knowledge and had pledged to attend the launch before his untimely death. “This is not just a book box it’s a door to opportunity for those who cannot afford to buy books,” said Umair Malik, president of MSU. “Through this effort, we hope to ignite a love for books and ensure no youth is left behind due to lack of access.”\n\nThe inaugural ceremony held at Nahqi Park was well-attended by students, youth leaders, political representatives, writers, and civil society members.\n\nMSU office-bearers, including general secretary Ayaz Khan, and activists like Rahmat Shah Mohmand, Waseem Mohmand, Rizwan Mohmand, Faisal Khan, and Adnan Mohmand, were among the prominent attendees.\n\nVolunteers from MSU donated a variety of books on the spot, kickstarting the library’s collection. The mood was both celebratory and emotional, as participants remembered Shaheed Maulana Khanzeb, whose name will now remain permanently associated with MSU’s library projects.\n\nThe MSU has also announced that similar libraries will soon be established in other tehsils of Mohmand district, making it the first grassroots literary initiative of its kind in the newly-merged districts of former Fata.\n\n“Our goal is simple, bring books closer to the people, parks are places of leisure — why not make them places of learning too,” MSU representatives said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 16th, 2025",
