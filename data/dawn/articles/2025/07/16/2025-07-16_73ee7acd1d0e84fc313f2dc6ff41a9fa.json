In November 2022, he was made a Supreme Court judge.\n\nThe judge kept the case files with him for writing a detailed order and did not return them to the IHC registrar despite his elevation to the top court.\n\nAccording to court officials, the files were returned recently without any detailed order.\n\nThe move has created a legal ‘grey area’ as the IHC is once again hearing a set of petitions filed against amendments introduced to Peca earlier this year by the incumbent government.\n\nSome petitioners, who challenged the fresh amendments, relied on Justice Minallah’s 2022 short order to substantiate their case against criminalisation of defamation.\n\nHowever, in the absence of detailed reasoning, legal experts term such citation as weak.\n\nWhile a court official told Dawn the case files might be handed over to a bench for rehearing, legal experts think otherwise.\n\nAccording to former law minister Farooq H. Naek, a short order is a “perfect judgement”, but in the absence of detailed reasoning, the judgement can be labelled as weak.\n\nHe wondered why the files were not returned to the IHC registrar by Justice Minallah for three years.\n\nLegal expert Mohammad Akram Sheikh told Dawn the Supreme Court thoroughly discussed the validity of short orders in a judgment authored by former chief justice Moham­mad Ajmal Mian in 1997.\n\nHe pointed out that a short order announced and signed by a judge is considered a valid judicial order.\n\nIn Mr Sheikh’s opinion, Justice Minallah could’ve given a reasoning for his judgement while at the IHC, but may not do so now that he is at the Supreme Court.\n\nIn February 2022, the PTI government had promulgated a presidential ordinance amending the Peca.\n\nThe controversial ordinance modified the definition of a ‘natural person’ to include “company, association or body of persons whether incorporated or not, institutions, organisations, authority or any other body established by the government.”\n\nEssentially, it enabled any per­son to lodge a complaint over criticism of a civic body or any government entity or institution.\n\nTwo factions of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists, Pakistan Broadcasters Asso­cia­tion and other activists challenged the ordinance.\n\nJustice Minallah, in his short order, “allowed” the petitions and struck down Section 20, which dealt with the defamation of a ‘natural person’.\n\nSubsequently, the court decl­ared the ordinance “unconstitutional” and “invalid” and declared it void.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 16th, 2025",
