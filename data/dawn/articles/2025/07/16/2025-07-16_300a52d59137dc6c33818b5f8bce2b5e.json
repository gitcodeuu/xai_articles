  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Pak­­istan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has termed the move to transform the Frontier Constabulary into a Fed­e­ral Constabulary as unco­nstitutional and unlawful, stating that the Centre had clearly encroached upon the provincial autonomy and violated the spirit of the 18th Amendment by expanding the force’s def­ined role nationwide without clear constitutional provisions.\n\nPTI Central Inform­a­t­i­on Secretary Sheikh Waq­as Akram, in a statement, noted the FC upgrade to the status of federal force was unconstitutional.\n\n“The party strongly rejects this encroachment into provincial domains, which is an unlawful move that violates constitutional principles and undermines the federation’s framework,” he said.\n\nHe described the move as an attempt to centralise control over law and order matters.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 16th, 2025",
