These conditions become “a form of unauthorised punishment not intended by the legislature”, he wrote.\n\nHe emphasised that it was the constitutional duty of every organ of the state — the executive, the judiciary and the legislature — to take urgent steps for ensuring that the criminal justice system serves the people of this country and they repose their trust and confidence in its fairness, impartiality and independence.\n\nJustice Minallah presided over a three-member bench hearing the appeal of Tahir alias Tahri, who had challenged a 2014 Lahore High Court (LHC) decision upholding his conviction and death sentence for the murder of five individuals.\n\nJustice Minallah observed that a weak and compromised criminal justice system undermines the rule of law and thus encourages corruption, authoritarianism and the rule of the powerful and privileged instead. “An effective and responsive criminal justice system, free from political interference and corruption, is a fundamental right of every citizen, while inexpensive and expeditious justice is a commitment of the state under the Constitution,” he wrote.\n\nHe conceded that judiciary was also responsible when the process of appeal exceeds the necessary and reasonable time required for its completion, but other branches of the state — the executive and legislature — were equally responsible for ensuring that the conditions in the prisons were humane and that the treatment of prisoners was not cruel, inhumane and degrading.\n\nIn the case at hand, Justice Minallah regretted that the appellant was sentenced to death by the trial court on Sept 3, 2008, and the appeal was preferred within time. The LHC decided the appeal on Sept 18, 2014, and the reference was answered in the affirmative, and thus, the sentence of death was confirmed.\n\nBut there was a six-year delay in deciding the appeal of a prisoner who has been handed down a death sentence, which cannot be justified when the necessary time for taking up the appeal and its ultimate disposal should not have been more than a year, Justice Minallah bemoaned.\n\nThe appellant had then sought leave by filing a petition before the Supreme Court, and the necessary and reasonable time required for its final disposal should not have been more than 12 months, he wrote.\n\nThe petition, which was filed in 2014, was fixed for hearing for the first time after seven years — on March 22, 2021 — and finally on Jan 29, 2025. It took more than 17 years to complete the appeal process from the date when the death sentence was handed down, the judgement regretted.\n\nThroughout this time, the prisoner remained in a death cell, despite having no role in the delay nor any control over the procedural hurdles. Justice Minallah said such delays grossly exceed the “necessary and reasonable” time that should be required for appellate procedures.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
