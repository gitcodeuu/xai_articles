  "content": "KARACHI: The cement industry ended FY25 on a subdued note as domestic sales declined by 3pc to 37.017 million tonnes, down from 38.181m tonnes in the previous year. However, exports surged by 39.5pc to 9.204m tonnes from 7.110m tonnes, according to data released by the All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association (APCMA).\n\nOverall cement despatches — combining local sales and exports — registered marginal growth of 2.05pc, reaching 46.221m tonnes in FY25 compared to 45.291m tonnes in FY24.\n\nIn June 2025, local cement despatches stood at 2.597m tonnes, down 16pc from 3.079m tonnes in June 2024. Exports during the month jumped 82pc to 859,204 tonnes from 472,865 tonnes in the same period last year. Total cement despatches in June 2025 were 3.457m tonnes, reflecting a 3pc decline from 3.552m tonnes in June 2024.\n\nAn APCMA spokesperson attributed the slowdown in domestic sales to weak demand and urged the government to reduce duties and taxes on cement, calling it a basic necessity rather than a luxury item. “To boost industrial activity and job creation, we must find ways to increase domestic off-take and utilise idle capacity,” the spokesperson said.\n\nOil sales\n\nThe country’s oil sales grew by 7pc in FY25 to 16.32m tonnes, up from 15.28m tonnes in FY24, supported by economic recovery and a decline in fuel smuggling due to regional tensions.\n\nJune 2025 oil sales rose by 8pc year-on-year and 2pc month-on-month to 1.57m tonnes.\n\nPetrol (motor spirit) and high-speed diesel (HSD) sales in FY25 increased by 6pc and 10pc, reaching 7.599m tonnes and 6.892m tonnes, respectively. However, furnace oil (FO) sales declined by 23pc to 806,000 tonnes.\n\nKarachi Port activity\n\nCargo handling at Karachi Port Trust (KPT) rose by 4.45pc in FY25, reaching 54 million tonnes compared to 51.7m tonnes in FY24. It also achieved an all-time high in container handling, recording 2.65m twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) during the fiscal year.\n\nVessel movement also increased by 11pc. Out of 1,943 vessels handled, KPT received 1,093 container ships, 218 bulk carriers, 180 general cargo ships, and 452 liquid bulk tankers in FY25, according to a press release.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
