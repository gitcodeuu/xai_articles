He said that according to the notification, the committee had to complete its probe within seven days.\n\nMr Khayyam said that according to terms of reference of the committee, they had to inquire into multiple aspects of the incident. He said that they were assigned to conduct thorough and impartial investigation into the flash flood incident, which had resulted into loss of precious lives.\n\nHe said that that they would assess and identify lapses or negligence on part of government functionaries and tourists.

The bench directed him to continue with the operation without extending favour to any person.\n\nThe petitioners’ lawyers stated that government was having two helicopters and if it intended it could have saved lives of the deceased persons. The petitioners have also requested the court to issue directives for the respondents to cancel all mining activities, carried out through auction or otherwise, in the Swat River.\n\nThey said that the failure of Rescue 1122 and provincial authorities to respond timely and effectively caused unnecessary and avoidable loss of lives.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
