The bench referred ANP’s plea to the ECP with directives to decide the matter within 10 days.\n\nLast year, the ECP had allocated 10 seats reserved for women to JUI-F, eight to PML-N, six to PPP and one each to ANP and PTIP.\n\nSimilarly, two seats reserved for non-Muslims were allotted to JUI-F and one each to PML-N and PPPP.\n\nThe number of seats held by opposition parties in the KP Assembly is expected to jump from 27 to 52 following the Constitutional Bench’s decision to render the PTI ineligible for reserved seats in the national and provincial assemblies.\n\nThe judgement, issued last month, restored several March 2024 notifications of the ECP declaring 25 candidates of opposition parties elected to reserved seats in the provincial assembly.\n\nCurrently, the 120-strong house has 93 PTI-backed MPAs, who were elected as independents, while the 25 reserved seats were vacant.\n\nOn Wednesday, the ECP allocated reserved seats in the Punjab and Sindh assemblies, boosting the tallies of all major political parties, except the PTI.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
