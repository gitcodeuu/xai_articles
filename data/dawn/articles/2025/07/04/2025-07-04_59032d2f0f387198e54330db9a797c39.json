  "content": "BLACLAVA (Maur­itius): Pakistan’s snooker campaign at the Common­wealth Champio­nship suffered an early setback as the nation’s most decorated cueist, Mohammad Asif, bowed out following a narrow 3-2 defeat to Scotland’s Ross Valance in a tense first-round encounter on Thursday.\n\nThe 42-year-old Asif, holder of five international titles and Pakistan’s most successful player, started strongly, taking the opening frame decisively (1-42). Valance responded immediately to level the match (37-4).\n\nThe Pakistani veteran regained the lead convincingly by claiming the third frame (0-57). the 37-year-old Valance once again pulled level, edging a tight fourth frame (34-28).\n\nThe match went to a deciding fifth frame, where Valance held his nerve to secure the victory (44-21).\n\nThis result marks the end of Asif’s journey in the singles event at the Commonwealth Champi­onship.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
