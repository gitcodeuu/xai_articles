Formed in April 2023, the body is working to develop a 10-year roadmap for accelerated adoption of AI in different sectors.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Press Information Department, during the meeting, Iqbal emphasised that it was time for Pakistan to move with clarity and purpose.\n\n“He stated that AI adoption cannot be advanced in isolation and must instead be guided by cross-sectoral collaboration, alignment with national priorities, and effective coordination across all relevant institutions,” the statement read.\n\nIt added that the taskforce was assigned a clear mandate to identify twelve key sectors, including education, health, agriculture, climate, business, and governance, where AI applications can generate measurable national benefits.\n\n“Each sector will establish a multi-stakeholder working group, comprising experts from government, academia, and the private sector. These groups will develop sector-specific AI roadmaps, with defined objectives, timelines, and resource requirements,” the statement said. “The purpose is to ensure that Pakistan not only aligns with global technological trends but also maximises the utility of AI in solving domestic challenges.”\n\nThe minister also directed the establishment of a national AI fund to provide financial support for innovative ideas and pilot projects. To utilise these resources effectively, he called for the mapping of AI experts, research centres, and resources across the country.\n\nIqbal, according to the statement, instructed the task force to organise a national AI workshop in collaboration with the Pakistan IT Industry Association (P@SHA) and other relevant industry bodies to provide a platform for dialogue between government, academia, and industry.\n\n“It will focus on designing practical AI solutions tailored to Pakistan’s development context,” the statement read.\n\nLast year, Iqbal inaugurated a three-day international conference on 3D printing and vacuum technology at the National Centre for Physics (NCP) at Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad, calling on scientists, researchers and innovators to work tirelessly to position Pakistan at the forefront of technological advancements.",
