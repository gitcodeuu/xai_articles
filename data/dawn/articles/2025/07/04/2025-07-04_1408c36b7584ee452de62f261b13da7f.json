  "content": "ISLAMABAD: In a significant move towards di­­gital transformation, the Supreme Court has instituted an e-filing system across all its registries in Islamabad, Lahore, Pesha­war, Karachi and Quetta.\n\nThe system allows for ele­­ctronic submission of case files alongside traditional paper-based methods. Digital copies of petitions, memos, judgements, and orders are uploaded to the Court’s Case Manage­ment System (CMS), from where they are automatically transmitted to relevant parties and respondents via emails.\n\nThese documents can also be accessed online th­­rough the Supreme Cou­rt’s Case Search Page. This shift aims to reduce paper correspondence and signi­ficantly cut down on time and costs, according to an official announcement.\n\nTo ensure smooth delivery of digital documents and wider adoption of the new system, the apex cou­rt has asked the Supreme Court Bar Association (SCBA) and Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) to provide the email addresses and mobile numbers of all ad­­vocates-on-record (AORs) and advocates Supreme Court (ASCs) for registration with the CMS.\n\nThe attorney general for Pakistan, Cabinet Divi­si­­on Secretary, all advocates general, prosecutors general and provincial chief secretaries have been asked to nominate focal persons to coordinate on e-filing matters, along with their official emails and mobile numbers. All relevant details should be sent to the Supreme Court at ecourt@scp.gov.pk.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
