He said it had expired and the absence of a new master plan has caused difficulties across all sectors and led to the city’s unregulated expansion.\n\nHe expressed optimism that upon completion of this project and the formulation of the Master Plan 2047, it will be possible to better address Karachi’s infrastructure and public issues.\n\nThe mayor added that the Sindh government and the local government department were making all-out efforts to ensure that all relevant stakeholders who can play a vital role in the city’s and country’s progress are included in the formation of the plan.\n\nIt may be noted that six master plans have been prepared for Karachi in the 1923, 1948, 1952, 1974, 1991 and 2007. The last plan — Karachi Strategic Development Plan 2020 — was prepared by the now defunct City District Government Karachi but it could not be fully implemented due to various reasons.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
