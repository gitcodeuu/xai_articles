Our goal is for both Pakistan and Afghanistan to achieve polio-free status simultaneously,” he said.\n\nSo far this year, 14 polio cases have been reported in Pakistan: eight from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, four from Sindh, and one each from Punjab and Gilgit-Bal­tistan. Islam­abad, Balochistan, and Azad Jam­mu and Kashmir remain polio-free.\n\nLast year, 74 cases were reported nationwide.\n\nSyed Irfan Raza also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
