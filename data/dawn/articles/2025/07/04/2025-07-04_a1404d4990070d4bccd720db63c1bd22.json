  "content": "LAHORE: Punjab Assembly Speaker Malik Muhammad Ah­­med Khan on Thursday filed a reference with the Election Com­mission against 26 PTI legislators over ‘unparliamentary conduct’ during the assembly’s session on June 27.\n\nThe disqualification reference was moved against the same lawmakers who were suspended for disrupting Chief Mi­­nister Maryam Nawaz’s speech and causing chaos in the house.\n\nThe reference outlines a series of violations including disorderly conduct, misbehaviour and disregard for the speaker’s rulings. It said the MPAs deliberately disru­p­t­­ed proceedings with shouting and commotion, forcing the suspension of the assembly proce­e­dings despite repeated calls for order.\n\nThe members allegedly used unparliamentary language and created an atmosphere of pandemonium and disorder.\n\nReference submitted to the commission seeks action against 26 lawmakers for disrupting CM Maryam’s speech\n\nThe PA speaker cited Rules 15 and 210 of the Assembly’s Rules of Procedure, emphasising that he exercised his authority to recommend action against the members for intentionally disrupting proceedings.\n\nHe stressed that such misconduct is a crime against democratic norms and a breach of the oath taken by elected representatives to uphold the Constitution.\n\nOn June 28, the speaker announced his intention to send this reference after the suspension of the 26 opposition members’ privileges due to their ‘disruptive’ behaviour and ‘vandalism’. Speaking to the media at the ECP in Islamabad, the speaker reiterated his stance against ab­­usive language, hooliganism, and physical aggression within the assembly.\n\nHe highlighted the issue of finance ministers being unable to deliver budget speeches for the past 15 years due to such disruptions, questioning the public’s right to hear the budget details. He said his actions are aimed at upholding the constitution and maintaining the dignity of the parliamentary process.\n\nThe MPAs named in the reference are Fahad Masood, Tanveer Aslam, Syed Rifaat Mahmood, Yasir Mahmood Qureshi, Kale­emullah Khan, Ansar Iqbal, Ali Asif, Zulfiqar Ali, Ahmed Mujtaba, Shahid Javed, Muham­mad Ismail, Khyal Ahmed, Sha­hbaz Ahmed, Tayyab Ra­­shid, Imtiaz Mahmood, Ali Imtiaz, Rashid Tufail, Rai Murtaza Iqbal, Khalid Zubair Nisar, Ijaz Shafi, Iman Kanwal, Muham­mad Naeem, Sajjad Ahmed, Rana Aurangzeb, Shahbaz Amir and Osama Asghar Ali Gujjar.\n\nAsked whether disruption of a speech was valid grounds for disqualification, an ECP official said the commission will examine the relevant constitutional and legal provisions, including the Punjab Assembly Rules. He said the reference will be fixed for hearing soon, pointing out that the ECP is bound to decide a disqualification reference within 90 days.\n\nIftikhar A. Khan in Islamabad also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
