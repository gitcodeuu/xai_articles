They waited for a long time for water to recede.\n\n“The drainage system across the city is choked by mud as the TMA workers never cleaned them,” he said.\n\nIn Razaar, municipal workers on Wednesday began clearing drains after the floodwaters damaged crops and trading centres in tehsil headquarters Shews Adda under the supervision of the revenue department.\n\nThe situation in Chota Lahor tehsil was no different as drains were clogged because of mud and plastic bags.\n\nIn the Anbar area, around 20 vehicles were trapped in the floodwaters.\n\nFarman Khan of Maneri Bala told Dawn the floodwaters entered vehicles and were relocated after five hours.\n\nThe people alleged that the majority of municipal workers remained busy with personal work of their bosses, leaving drains clogged.\n\n“Workers didn’t do what they’re meant for,” he said.\n\nThe TMA officials said they had made serious efforts to clean drains but staff shortage stopped them from carrying out the activity in all areas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
