The project spans 117.6km and will be developed as a six-lane greenfield motorway under a build-operate-transfer model.\n\nWith an estimated cost of Rs202.61bn and proposed viability gap funding of Rs40bn, the project will be procured through international competitive bidding.\n\nThe planning minister emphasised the importance of utilising private sector investment, innovation, and management skills to overcome financial constraints, accelerate project completion, and improve efficiency in delivering essential infrastructure and services, given the resource constraints in the public sector.\n\n“Public-private partnerships are a cornerstone of our infrastructure development strategy. By leveraging private capital and expertise, we are not only accelerating the delivery of critical national projects but also ensuring long-term sustainability, transparency and value for money for the public,” Mr Iqbal was quoted as saying during the meeting.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
