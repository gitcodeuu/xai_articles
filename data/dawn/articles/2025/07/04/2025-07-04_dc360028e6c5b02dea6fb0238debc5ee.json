However, security forces responded immediately after the attack and killed four terrorists.\n\nMr Rind said that the government has revisited its security plan to reinforce the state’s writ and ensure the safety of citizens’ lives and property.\n\nThe spokesman noted that banks are usually guarded by private security, but steps are now being taken to ensure the protection of both public and private properties.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 4th, 2025",
