  "content": "A pet lion escaped and chased a woman and two children down a busy street in Lahore, police said on Friday, with dramatic footage showing the big cat leaping over a wall before pouncing on them.\n\nCCTV footage released by the police showed the lion jumping the barrier around its home and pursuing a woman carrying her shopping on Thursday night.\n\nThe lion jumped on her back, knocking her to the ground, the footage showed.\n\nA police report quoted the father as saying the lion then turned to his five-year-old and seven-year-old children, and clawed their arms and faces.\n\nAll three were taken to the hospital but were not in critical condition.\n\nThe owners who ran out of the house were “amused to see their lion attack” the passersby, the father added in the report.\n\nPolice said on Friday they had arrested three men.\n\n“The suspects fled from the spot, taking the lion with them. They were arrested within 12 hours of the incident,” the office of the Lahore Deputy Inspector General Operations told AFP.\n\nThe lion, an 11-month-old male, was confiscated by police and sent to a wildlife park. Officials at the facility said that the animal appeared to be in good health.\n\nKeeping exotic animals, especially big cats, as pets has long been seen as a sign of privilege and power in Punjab.\n\nIn December 2024, an adult lion escaped from its enclosure in another neighbourhood of Lahore, terrorising residents before being shot dead by a security guard.\n\nThe incident prompted the provincial government to pass new laws regulating the sale, purchase, breeding and ownership of big cats. The law now requires owners to obtain licenses for the animals which are barred from being kept in residential areas.\n\nBreeders have to pay a hefty fee for registration, while farms have to be a minimum of 10 acres in size.",
