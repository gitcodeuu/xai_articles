We are saying, at the elite level, for you to compete in the female category, you have to be biologically female.\n\n“It was always very clear to me and the World Athletics Council that gender cannot trump biology. We particularly want to thank our member federations for their support and commitment in the implementation of these new regulations.”\n\nAthletics has spent years debating eligibility criteria to compete in women’s events, amid questions over biological advantages for transgender athletes and those with differences of sex development (DSD).\n\nWorld Athletics bans transgender women who have gone through male puberty from competing in women’s events, while it requires female DSD athletes whose bodies produce high testosterone levels to lower them in order to be eligible.\n\nEarlier this year, a working group found that those rules were not tight enough, with a pre-clearance test for the SRY gene being one of several recommendations the group made for revised rules.\n\nThe SRY gene reveals the presence of the Y chromosome, which is an indicator of biological sex.\n\nThe test was also approved by World Boxing in May when they introduced mandatory sex testing for all boxers.\n\nEarlier this month, the European Court upheld a 2023 ruling that double 800 metres Olympic champion Caster Semenya’s appeal to a Swiss Federal Tribunal against regulations that barred her from competing had not been properly heard.\n\nSemenya was appealing against World Athletics regulations that female athletes with DSDs medically reduce their testosterone levels.",
