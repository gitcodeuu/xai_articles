  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The traditional jirga system in the merged tribal areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa retains only cultural significance and has no legal status under the Constitution, a National Assembly committee was informed here on Tuesday.\n\nThe Standing Committee of the National Assembly on Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit-Baltistan and States and Frontier Regions (Safron) met at the Parliament House. Member of National Assembly Haji Imtiaz Ahmed Choudhry (MNA) chaired the meeting.\n\nAfter the merger, dispute resolution is now managed through provincially supervised mechanisms such as Saliseen Panels under the KP ADR Act 2020, the members were informed.\n\nThey were also told that the federal government’s role is now consultative and facilitative, focusing on coordination, policy support and development through capacity-building efforts.\n\nThe committee stressed the importance of a smooth, transparent, and accountable implementation of post-merger reforms in the ex-FATA region. It recommended briefing local lawmakers on the mandate of the prime minister-constituted committee, particularly regarding the revival of the jirga system and strengthening civil administration to rebuild public trust.\n\nDuring the briefing on ex-Fata, it was stated that after the 25th Constitutional Amendment in 2018, Fata was merged with Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), bringing the region under the full jurisdiction of the Constitution of Pakistan. Judicial authority now rests with the Peshawar High Court, while governance, including law and order, civil administration and justice delivery, lies solely with the KP government.\n\nThe committee reviewed the federal government’s scope and limits in the post-merger ex-Fata areas, with specific reference to the formation of jirgas and committees.\n\nIt also discussed the mineral resources of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJ&K).\n\nThe committee was informed that AJ&K is endowed with significant reserves of major minerals, including granite, marble, ruby and coal, as well as minor minerals such as sand and gravel.\n\nMining concessions are granted through both direct leasing and competitive bidding. Currently, the department manages 145 mineral titles and is focused on promoting sustainable mining practices, transparency, and inclusive economic development.\n\nThe committee appreciated the efforts of the Industries and Minerals Resources Department and recommended providing details of the lease procedure, as well as the names of individuals or entities allotted leases in AJ&K.\n\nThe committee expressed its commitment to safeguarding the rights and interests of the people of Kashmir, Gilgit-Baltistan and the merged tribal districts.\n\nThose who attended the meeting included MNAs Iqbal Khan, Mian Ghous Muhammad, Abdul Qadir Khan, Fateh Ullah Khan (both online), Naveed Aamir, Dr Nikhat Shakeel Khan, Farakh Khan and Kiran Imran Dar.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
