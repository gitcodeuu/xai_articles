Like when he spoke about how the opposition leaders were asking why he did not take back Azad Kashmir: “Who else can they ask this to except me?”\n\nIndia, he said, had called Pakistan’s “nuclear bluff”, and showed the world it would no longer be cowed by threats of escalation.\n\nShift in strategic posture\n\nHe claimed India struck “terror bases deep inside Pakistan” in just 22 minutes after the April 22 Pahalgam attack, and that “Islamabad’s sabre-rattling, including veiled nuclear threats, did not stop India from responding forcefully”.\n\nIt is worth noting that Indian military officials have previously said there was never a moment of nuclear threat from either side.\n\n“Pakistan had some inkling of Indian action and started issuing nuclear threats, but could do nothing when terror targets were hit,” Modi said.\n\n“India responds on its own terms; bullets will be met with cannons.”\n\nThis response, he claimed, exposed the limits of Pakistan’s deterrence and revealed a shift in India’s strategic posture. “Only three countries spoke for Pakistan at the UN,” he said, but didn’t say how many spoke for India.\n\nRahul Gandhi had said in his speech that many countries had condemned terrorism, but none had condemned Pakistan after the Pahalgam attack on April 22.\n\n“No leader of any country asked India to stop any action in its defence against terror,” PM Modi said.\n\nUS Vice President J.D. Vance had tried calling him “three-four times” during Operation Sindoor, the Indian PM claimed, but he was too busy in high-level meetings with the armed forces.\n\nRahul’s challenge to Modi\n\nBefore Mr Modi’s speech, Rahul Gandhi had thrown a dare at the PM, pointing out President Donald Trump’s repeated claims of having stopped the war between India and Pakistan. “If Trump is lying, let Modi say he is lying,” Rahul had said.\n\nModi claimed Operation Sindoor had “planted India’s flag firmly in the global defence market” and there was an increasing interest in India-made munitions.\n\nHe also repeated the Indian claim that Pakistani military officials pleaded for a halt in hostilities.\n\nHe said former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru had cost India dearly with the 1960 Indus Waters Treaty. Modi called the treaty as unfair to India’s farmers, saying “blood and water cannot flow together”.\n\nThere was no mention of the losses India suffered in the prime minister’s speech. Several opposition leaders in both houses had asked for details on how many fighter jets, including Rafales, were lost.\n\nMr Gandhi claimed Defence Minister Rajnath Singh had himself revealed that the Director General of Military Operations was told by the Government of India to ask for a ceasefire just 30 minutes after Operation Sindoor began. “You told them we will not hit military targets; we do not want escalation.”\n\n“The government of India informed the government of Pakistan that we have no political will, and we will not fight,” he said.\n\nMr Gandhi also quoted Captain Shiv Kumar, India’s defence attache to Indonesia, as saying that India had lost some aircraft and that happened only because of the constraints given by the political leadership not to attack air defence and military targets. “You tied their hands behind their backs and the defence minister has said this in parliament itself.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
