The Sheikhpura deputy district health officer was also part of the joint raiding team, the official said.\n\nThe officials later shifted both the recipient and the donor to the District Headquarters Hospital, Sheikhpura, under the supervision of qualified health professionals.\n\nThe donor told the police that he was approached by a local quack, who offered him Rs500,000 for a kidney donation. The police initiated criminal proceedings against the arrested suspects, while raids were being conducted to nab other members of the racket, the police official said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
