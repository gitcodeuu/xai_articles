In some cases, appeals have been filed against those decisions that are currently pending before various high courts.\n\nThe order stated that forming an inquiry commission in such a context could interfere with pending, potentially rendering the legal process “ineffective”.\n\nInterim or final order\n\nThe two-judge bench also clarified that Justice Khan’s order was final as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.\n\nThe question over the order’s status was raised during the last hearing when the petitioners’ lawyer claimed the case was initially decided but the written verdict stated it would remain pending.\n\nThe division bench further clarified that although intra-court appeals are typically not filed against interim orders, the single bench’s ruling was final in nature as it had allowed the plea to establish the commission.\n\n‘Mysterious’ woman\n\nAlso on Tuesday, a woman named Komal Ismail also appeared before the division bench along with her lawyer.\n\nShe is accused of honey-trapping the victims using a false social media identity by the name of “Imaan”.\n\nIn a hearing earlier this month, Justice Khan directed the FIA to block her national identity card after she repeatedly failed to appear before the court.\n\nDuring Tuesday’s proceedings, Ms Ismail’s counsel argued her client was not a party in the main case, yet her CNIC was blocked and her name placed on the Exit Control List.\n\nJustice Soomro responded that Ms Ismail had only been asked to appear before the investigating officer and questioned the harm in complying with that direction.\n\nThe bench emphasised that while the case involving Ms Ismail remained under investigation, the court would not interfere in the matter.\n\nLater, the court linked Ms Ismail’s applications with the already pending intra-court appeals and adjourned the hearing.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
