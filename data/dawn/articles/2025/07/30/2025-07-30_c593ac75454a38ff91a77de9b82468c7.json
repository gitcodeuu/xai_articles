His seat in the National Assembly has become vacant following the disqualification.\n\nIn May, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) in Islamabad sentenced Mr Latif and four others to 27 years in prison for their involvement in the May 9, 2023, attack on the Ramna police station. The verdict was announced by ATC Special Court-II Judge Tahir Abbas Sipra, who found the accused guilty of arson, violence and attacking law enforcement personnel during the riots.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, a five-member bench of the commission, headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja heard a reference, a representation and a complaint to de-seat Chitrali on the basis of Anti-Terrorism Court verdict of May 30, 2025. The bench reserved judgement, which was placed on its website after office hours.\n\n“Deriving wisdom from the referred judgement wherein it has been held that “where there is a conviction recorded by a competent court against a person who is a member of the Parliament which has attained finality, the role and function of the Election Commission is confined to issuing notification of disqualification of the concerned member on the basis of the verdict of the Court,” it reads.\n\nDespite his conviction, a firebrand Mr Latif denied the charges, claiming he was wrongfully convicted in retaliation for refusing a Rs2 billion bribe to support the “controversial” 26th Constitutional Amendment. Mr Latif described the conviction as politically motivated, calling it an act of vengeance.\n\n‘Democracy at stake’\n\nPTI leader Barrister Gohar Ali Khan expressed concerns over the disqualification of PTI lawmakers, warning that “democracy is at stake”.\n\nTalking to a private TV channel, he acknowledged the growing concerns regarding the way political trials have been conducted, hinting that the situation had been clear from the beginning.\n\n“We could see the writing on the wall,” he added.\n\nThe PTI leader also asked the ECP to refrain from justifying its actions and instead “follow the Constitution and the law”.\n\nAppeals ‘open’\n\nWhen asked for comment, a senior ECP official clarified that under the Constitution, a parliamentarian stood disqualified from office following a conviction.\n\nThe official explained that while the right to appeal remains intact even after disqualification, the disqualified member’s seat remains vacant until a court ruling overturns the conviction.\n\nThe official noted that if a member receives interim relief from a high court, which suspends the sentence, the disqualification remains in place. However, should higher courts overturn the conviction, the ECP would restore the individual’s victory notification.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
