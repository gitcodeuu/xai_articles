Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering and principled support for the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination, including their right to a viable, independent and contiguous State of Palestine, based on the pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.”\n\nDuring his speech, Mr Dar urged the conference to “ensure universal recognition of the state of Palestine and its full UN membership”.\n\nHe said, “Pakistan stands ready to extend dedicated technical assistance and capacity building support to our Palestinian brothers and sisters… Pakistan is prepared to contribute to the building of institutions, including through participation in the Arab-OIC Plan, and any international protection mechanism.\n\n“The question of Palestine has impacted the entire region and beyond. We must give hope to the Palestinian people. The occupation must end, and end now. It is time for freedom, self-determination and statehood, and Palestine’s full membership of the UN. That will be the best guarantee for lasting peace in the region.”\n\nOn the sidelines of the conference, Mr Dar met Palestinian PM Mohammad Mustafa and held a detailed exchange on the grave situation in Gaza and occupied Palestinian territory.\n\nHe also met Kuwait’s Foreign Minister Abdullah Al-Yahya, expressed their “deep concern at continuing Israeli acts of aggression against Palestinians and worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
