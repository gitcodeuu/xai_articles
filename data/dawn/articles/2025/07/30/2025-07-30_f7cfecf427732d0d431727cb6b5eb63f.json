However, they also wreak havoc by triggering deadly floods, landslides and displacement, particularly in vulnerable, poorly drained, or densely populated areas.\n\nThis year’s monsoon rains continue to lash many parts of the country, prompting authorities to release an urban flooding warning for several cities.\n\nMansehra’s Rescue 1122 spokesperson, Amir Khadam Khan, told Dawn.com that 160 tourists were stranded after floods hit Naran, Jalkhad, Barwai and Besar.\n\n“Rescue 1122 personnel crossed the flood drain on foot near Besar to access more than 160 stranded tourists and vehicles,” he said. “All the people were safely evacuated and accommodated in nearby hotels.”\n\nHe added that the Naran Road was also blocked in multiple locations. However, after “tireless” efforts of 12 consecutive hours, it was cleared for all traffic by the National Highway Authority, with the support of the police and the Kaghan Development Authority.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the rescue operation still continued in the area, and the stranded tourists’ vehicles were also successfully recovered.\n\nHe added that during the operation, Rescue 1122 provided first aid to seven or eight people with minor injuries, severe body pain, hypoglycemia, vomiting and other ailments. Fresh water was also provided to the tourists.\n\n“Fortunately, no serious casualties were reported,” Khadam said.\n\nMeanwhile, flash floods triggered by heavy rain caused the deaths of two children due to a house collapse in the Hazara Division in the early hours of Wednesday morning.\n\nThe Abbottabad police spokesperson, Azam Khan, told Dawn.com that two children were killed after a house collapsed in Bakot, Abbottabad, on Tuesday night.\n\n“The bodies were recovered by locals,” he said, adding that the girls were between two and three years old.\n\nLast week, 250 tourists and passengers stranded at the Babusar Highway were rescued by the Diamer district administration, volunteers, police, Rescue 1122 and the army, according to a spokesperson.\n\nHowever, at the same time, the national death toll from monsoon-related casualties surged to 234 since late June, according to the National Disaster Mana­gement Authority. Of the 234 deaths, 79 were men, 42 women and 113 — nearly half of the total — were children.\n\nAt least four people drowned, and one child was still missing after a seven-seater van fell into a rain drain in Punjab’s Attock district, according to Rescue 1122.\n\n“At 02:46am, Attock Rescue 1122 received information about a vehicle falling into a storm drain,” according to a press release by District Emergency Officer Ali Hussain.\n\n“The BRV van fell into the rain drain in Tehsil Hassan Abdal at Jharika,” he added.\n\nThe bodies of four people have been recovered so far, Rescue 1122 Punjab spokesperson Farooq Ahmad said in a statement issued at 5:30pm.\n\n“Five people were rescued and shifted to the Hassan Abdal Tehsil Headquarters Hospital,” he added.\n\n“Rescue operation is underway to search for the body of a child, Mustafa.”",
