Tsunamis are sometimes referred to as “tidal waves”, but experts say this is inaccurate because they are not related to tides.\n\nAt their point of generation, tsunamis have a relatively small wave height, with peaks far apart.\n\nAs the waves approach the shore, they are compressed by the shelving of the sea floor, reducing the distance between the peaks and vastly increasing the height.\n\nWhen they hit the coast, tsunami waves can strike repeatedly over several hours, or even days.\n\nTo those on the shore, the first sign of something amiss can be the retreat of the sea, which is followed by the arrival of large waves.\n\n“The sea was driven back, and its waters flowed away to such an extent that the deep seabed was laid bare and many kinds of sea creatures could be seen,” wrote Roman author Ammianus Marcellinus of a tsunami that struck Alexandria in 365 AD.\n\n“Huge masses of water flowed back when least expected, and now overwhelmed and killed many thousands of people… some great ships were hurled by the fury of the waves onto the rooftops.”\n\nSeveral factors determine the height and destructiveness of a tsunami. They include the size of the quake, the volume of displaced water, the topography of the sea floor and whether there are natural obstacles that dampen the shock.\n\nThe Pacific Ocean is particularly prone to earthquakes and, therefore, to tsunamis, but over the millennia, tsunamis have occurred in many parts of the world.\n\nThe tsunami of December 2004 in the Indian Ocean was caused by a 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the Indonesian island of Sumatra.\n\nIt released energy equivalent to 23,000 of the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima, according to the US Geological Survey (USGS). Around 220,000 people in 11 nations were killed, many of them thousands of kilometres from the epicentre.",
