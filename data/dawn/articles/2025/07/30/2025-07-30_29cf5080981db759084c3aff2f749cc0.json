  "content": "KEYLONG: Just a few hundred kilometres southeast of India-held Kashmir, a new front over water sharing between Pakistan and India is emerging as New Delhi plans a raft of hydropower plants that threaten the Himalayan ecosystem and the communities it has sustained.\n\nThe day after an attack on tourists in Pahalgam, occupied Kashmir, on April 22, India announced it would “put in abeyance” the Indus Waters Treaty, a Cold War-era agreement that divided control of river systems that have an annual flow of roughly 200 billion cubic metres of water.\n\nAlthough a ceasefire in May brought Pakistan and India back from the brink of war, tensions are rising over another flashpoint: the waters of the Indus river basin.\n\nBrokered by the World Bank in 1960, the treaty has been one of the world’s most enduring water-sharing accords, surviving even full-blown wars between Pakistan and India.\n\nBut the suspension has sparked uncertainty over the treaty’s fate and opened the door for India to push energy development along the Himalaya’s rivers.\n\nExperts worry about environmental damage\n\nWithin days of saying India would halt its participation in the treaty, Prime Minister Narendra Modi instructed his ministries to fast-track long-stalled infrastructure projects on the western rivers of Chenab, Jhelum and Indus.\n\nThese waterways, control of which was assigned to Pakistan under the 1960 treaty, irrigate Pakistani farms downstream and were largely off-limits for Indian exploitation under the treaty.\n\nAt home in India, the prospect of accelerating hydropower projects has also sparked alarm.\n\nThe tribal communities in the windswept valleys of Lahaul and Spiti, in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh, fear that damming the rivers could destroy a generations-old way of life.\n\nBuilding boom\n\nSupporters of the project say the Indus basin can provide India with a source of clean energy and help meet the world’s demand for energy storage. The Himachal Pradesh government announced in January plans to build 22 new hydropower projects with a combined capacity of 828 megawatts across five districts, including Lahaul-Spiti.\n\nThe Chenab river, formed by headwaters in Lahaul-Spiti, will see the largest share, with nine hydropower plants totalling 595 MW, according to the plan.\n\nIndia may also build four reservoirs on tributaries of the Chenab and Jhelum rivers.\n\nPolicy experts see India’s strategy as a bid to assert control over the Himalayan waterways.\n\nThe suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty allows India to “pursue its development interests on the western rivers”, said Srinivas Chokkakula, president of the Centre for Policy Research in New Delhi.\n\nIndia now has the “time and means to build infrastructure to accumulate irrevocable leverage”, he said.\n\nFor people living in Lahaul and Spiti, such political calculations may pose a threat to their livelihood and traditions. Among them are the Bodh people and the Swangla tribe, whose languages and cultures are tied to Tibet. Isolated for much of the year by snowbound passes, these communities farm the rugged mountain slopes during the warmer months.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
