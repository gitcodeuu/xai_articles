  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan aims to expand its state-owned shipping fleet by 600pc over the next three years, with a focus on energy-efficient and climate-smart vessels.\n\nThe initiative, led by Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Muhammad Jun­aid Anwar Chaudhry, seeks to reduce reliance on foreign vessels, cut sea frei­ght costs, and align with global emission standards.\n\nDue to limited financial capacity of Pakistan National Shipping Corporation (PNSC), a cost-sharing mechanism has been devised, with Karachi Port Trust (KPT) and Port Qasim Authority (PQA) pledging funding support.\n\nAgreements were signed by KPT’s Abdullah Zaki, PQA Chairman Rear Admiral (retd) Syed Moazzam Ilyas, and PNSC CEO Syed Jarar Haider Kazmi.\n\nThe plan forms part of broader efforts to modernise maritime infrastructure, enhance trade connectivity, and support Pakistan’s climate goals under the prime minister’s directive.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 30th, 2025",
