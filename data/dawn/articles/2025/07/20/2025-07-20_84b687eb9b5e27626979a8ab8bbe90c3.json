  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Jamaat-i-Islami (JI) has announced a multi-front protest campaign — nationwide sit-ins against rising fuel, electricity and sugar prices, and a long march from Quetta to Islamabad for Balochistan’s rights.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Saturday, JI emir Hafiz Naeemur Rehman said his party is staging protest sit-ins across the country on Sunday (today) against the exploitative sugar mafia, and soaring electricity, gas and petrol prices.\n\nHe rejected the government’s economic policies as anti-people and criticised both the ruling coalition and opposition parties. “When it comes to personal gain, all factions unite and approve 300 per cent salary hikes for themselves,” he said.\n\nHe accused the ruling elite of shielding the sugar mafia, saying 90pc of the country’s 89 sugar mills were controlled by powerful political figures. “Dealerships are handed to unregistered agents, protected by every government. Sugar prices have surged from Rs140 to Rs200 per kg, placing a crushing burden on the people,” he said.\n\nHafiz Naeem announces Islamabad-Quetta long march for Balochistan’s rights on 25th\n\nThe JI emir also alleged that gas wells were deliberately shut down on the orders from the Petroleum Division, causing a loss of $1.5 billion to the national economy.\n\nHe criticised past governments for signing RLNG agreements that went against national interests.\n\nLong march\n\nThe JI emir said the “Give Rights to Balochistan” long march from Quetta to Islamabad, commencing on July 25, aimed to highlight the longstanding grievances of the province. “If any attempt is made to stop the march, the authorities will be responsible for the consequences,” he warned.\n\nMr Rehman alleged that India and the United States were fueling unrest in Balochistan, but also stressed the need to reduce the trust deficit between the state and the province’s youth. The genuine concerns of the people of Balochistan must be addressed, he added, announcing that grand jirgas would soon be held in both Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to resolve regional grievances.\n\nThe JI leader also raised concerns about lawlessness in Sindh’s riverine areas, citing the unchecked flow of weapons, abductions of minority traders, and the PPP’s failure to maintain law and order.\n\nCalling on the youth to join JI, he said the ruling elite and opposition are united only in protecting their own interests, showing indifference to the struggles of ordinary citizens. He also criticised the recent decision on reserved seats, terming it a “murder of justice”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 20th, 2025",
