Those who have constructed mud houses on the bed of the river and water channels should be shifted from the area by Sunday morning, he said.\n\nDr Cheema said more than 84 people were trapped in water in last Thursday’s rain who had settled on the bank of Soan River. “After this, it was decided to remove the people from the area immediately,” he added.\n\nIn reply to the encroachments along nullahs and banks of Soan River, the deputy commissioner said the district administration had already launched a drive to remove encroachments along the banks of the nullah and water channels.\n\nRawal Dam spillways to be opened today as water level rises\n\nHe added that flood relief camps had been established in the district with medical facilities, adding that these camps had been established in government schools, as there was summer vacation, and we used the buildings to accommodate the victims in case of emergency.\n\nDr Cheema said Section 144 imposed in the district and swimming in nullahs and water channels will not be allowed. He said Wasa, RWMC and Rawalpindi Municipal Corporation had been asked to clear the drains in the city area to avoid waterlogging.\n\nMeanwhile, he also chaired the meeting to review the arrangements regarding the excessive rainfall in the recent season. The meeting was attended by Additional Deputy Commissioner General Hasaan Tariq, Additional Deputy Commissioner Revenue Shahryar Shirazi, Incharge 1122, Deputy Director Small Dams and officials of other departments.\n\nHe stressed the need to activate the coordination of all concerned departments and issued instructions to the concerned authorities in this regard.\n\nHe said that the arrangements should be finalised regarding the rains that will start a day later, so that any situation can be dealt with immediately.\n\nHe said that any kind of construction on the river bed is illegal and will not be tolerated at all.\n\nOn this occasion, the deputy commissioner issued instructions to the Small Dams authorities to inform them at least three hours before the opening of the spillways of the Rawal Dam so that the administration can be prepared and its publicity and other arrangements can be completed.\n\nRawal Dam spillways\n\nThe water level at Rawal Dam has risen to the red mark, and the dam management decided to open the spillways on Sunday (today).\n\nAccording to an official from the Small Dam Organisation, as the water level of Rawal Dam has reached 1,748 feet, the spillways will be opened on Sunday (today) at 6am and will stay open until the level drops to 1,746 feet.\n\nThe Islamabad administration has directed all response units, departments, monitoring camps, and relief camps to remain on alert. Police reserves and law enforcement agencies will also be deployed along the Korang River. Additionally, strict action will be taken against anyone entering the river or violating section 144. The Rawalpindi administration has been consulted.\n\nThe Rawal Dam administration has urged residents near the dam and downstream areas to stay away from the waterfront and avoid unnecessary travel nearby.\n\nFishermen and those involved in boating activities are strictly advised to refrain from the water during this period. People should stay in touch with local authorities and follow their instructions in case of an emergency. Secure livestock and property in areas prone to potential flooding.\n\nAll concerned individuals and authorities are urged to take necessary precautions and cooperate with the local administration to prevent any untoward incidents. Following the rise in water level, the dam’s capacity should be sufficient until winter rains.\n\nWasa Managing Director Saleem Ashraf stated that the current water level at Rawal Dam is 1,748 feet, with a maximum capacity of 1,952 feet. He added that last year, the dam filled twice during the monsoon season. “Once it fills, then the water will be sufficient till winter rains,” he said.\n\nRegarding Khanpur Dam, Mr Ashraf noted that the water level is at 1,939 feet, with a maximum capacity of 1,982 feet. He mentioned that at present, the water is enough for 130 days to meet the needs of the twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad. He also anticipated more rain from 20 July in the upper regions of the twin cities, which will increase water levels in the dams and underground aquifers.\n\nThe twin cities rely on water from three main dams: Rawal, Simly, and Khanpur dams. Rawalpindi city and Cantonment obtain water from Rawal and Khanpur dams, while Islamabad receives water from Simly and Khanpur dams.\n\nThe remaining water requirements are met through tube wells. In Rawalpindi, more than 500 tubewells in the city and 200 in the cantonment areas. “Water shortages may occur in the cantonment areas and Islamabad in the coming days if the rains do not occur in the catchment areas of Khanpur,” he warned.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 20th, 2025",
