  "content": "DOHA: The Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda-backed armed group M23 signed a ceasefire deal on Saturday to end fighting that has devastated the country’s mineral-rich but conflict-torn east.\n\nThe two sides signed a declaration of principles whose terms include a “permanent ceasefire”, after three months of talks in Qatar. It follows a separate peace deal between the Congolese and Rwandan governments signed in Washington last month.\n\nRich in natural resources, especially lucrative minerals, eastern DRC has been wracked by conflict for more than three decades, creating a humanitarian crisis and forcing hundreds of thousands of people from their homes.\n\nThousands were killed in a lightning offensive by the M23 in January and February, in which the group seized vast swathes of territory, including the key provincial capitals of Goma and Bukavu.\n\nIn the agreement signed in Doha, the warring parties agreed to “uphold their commitment to a permanent ceasefire”, including refraining from “hate propaganda” and “any attempt to seize by force new positions”.\n\nThe deal includes a roadmap for restoring state authority in eastern DRC, and an agreement for the two sides to open direct negotiations toward a comprehensive peace agreement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 20th, 2025",
