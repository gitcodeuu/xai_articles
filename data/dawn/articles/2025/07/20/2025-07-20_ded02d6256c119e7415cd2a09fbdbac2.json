The shots were fired approximately one kilometre away from the aid distribution site at nighttime when it’s not active,” it said in a statement.\n\nOn Tuesday, the UN rights office in Geneva said it had recorded at least 875 killings within the past six weeks in the vicinity of aid sites and food convoys in Gaza — the majority of them close to GHF distribution points.\n\n‘Imminent death’\n\nAt least 18 more people were killed in other Israeli attacks across Gaza on Saturday, health officials said.\n\nThe Israeli military said that it had struck militants’ weapon depots and sniping posts in a few locations in the enclave.\n\nMost people in Gaza have been displaced at least once by the fighting, and doctors and aid agencies say the physical and mental health effects of 21 months of conflict are being increasingly seen.\n\n“We are receiving cases suffering from extreme exhaustion and complete fatigue, in addition to severe emaciation and acute malnutrition due to prolonged lack of food,” the director of the Kuwaiti Field Hospital in Khan Yunis, Sohaib Al-Hums, said on Friday.\n\n“Hundreds” of people were facing “imminent death”, he added.\n\nAccountability\n\nThe US ambassador to Israel on Saturday visited a Christian village in the occupied West Bank and urged accountability for an attack on an ancient church, which residents have blamed on Israeli settlers.\n\nIn early July, the village of Taybeh was hit by an arson attack in the area of the ruins of the Byzantine-era Church of Saint George, which dates back to the fifth century.\n\nAmbassador Mike Huckabee, an evangelical Christian and staunch advocate for Israel, said it was “unacceptable to commit an act of sacrilege by desecrating a place that is supposed to be a place of worship”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 20th, 2025",
