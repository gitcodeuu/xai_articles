  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan and China have decided to form technical working groups to explore and implement projects focusing on high-yield cotton seed development, advanced water-saving irrigation technologies and modern farming techniques.\n\nThe decision to form technical working groups was taken at a meeting between Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain, and a Chinese delegation on the sidelines of the China-Pakistan Economic and Trade Exchange Conference in Islamabad.\n\nMr Hussain highlighted the challenges Pakistan has faced in recent years, especially in cotton production, where declining yields and outdated seed varieties have created major setbacks, and expressed keen interest in learning from Xinjiang’s remarkable progress in improving agricultural productivity, especially in regions with arid and semi-arid climates, which closely resemble many parts of Pakistan.\n\nHe noted that Xinjiang’s achievements in crop yield optimisation, irrigation management and mechanisation could serve as a model for transformation in Pakistan’s agriculture sector.\n\nIn response, Ambassador Jiang Zaid­ong reaffirmed China’s commitment to deepening agricultural cooperation with Pakistan.\n\nHe appreciated Pakistan’s proactive approach and openness to collaboration and highlighted the potential for long-term partnership in food security, technology transfer, and rural development.\n\nMr Hussain reiterated that agriculture development is not just a national priority but also a strategic domain for advancing the time-tested Pakistan-China friendship.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 20th, 2025",
