  "content": "MANAMA: Pakistan’s Mohammad Asif etched another glorious chapter in his storied career, defeating India’s Brijesh Damani 4-3 [98(87)-37, 75-55, 0-80(51), 40-52, 41-64, 91-29, 78(40)-9] in a pulsating final of the IBSF World Masters Snooker Championship here at Crowne Plaza late on Friday.\n\nThe 42-year-old stalwart in the process proved his credentials as the country’s most successful cueist, securing his remarkable sixth international title and a historic fourth IBSF world crown.\n\nReflecting on his win, Asif highlighted the unique intensity of matches against Indian opponents. He explained that these high-stakes frames carry enormous pressure where no player wants to lose.\n\n“The drive to win this one was non-negotiable,” Asif stated. “The level of difficulty out there was incredibly high, perhaps more than viewers realised,” Asif said in a video message after the decider.\n\nFacing a determined Damani, who defeated Asif earlier in the group stage, the Pakistan veteran displayed nerves of steel and vintage break-building prowess to overcome a mid-match deficit and triumph in a dramatic seven-frame encounter.\n\nThe final unfolded with Damani, who won Asian team snooker title last month, starting strongly in the first frame, as the Indian got a 21 break. But Asif seized his chance masterfully compiling a superb clearance break of 87, built on five blacks and five pinks, to dominate the frame 98-37.\n\nIn the second frame, the 42-year-old Damani again took an early lead with a 44 break. However, a missed cannon on the reds and subsequent foul gave Asif an opening. The Pakistan veteran nailed a crucial long red and crafted a 41 break. Damani had a golden chance to level the frame with only the colours left but missed an easy green, allowing Asif to clear up and take a 2-0 lead with a 75-55 win.\n\nThe Indian responded emphatically in the third frame. After Asif missed a tricky red, Damani controlled the frame with breaks of 29 and 51, forcing Asif to concede 80-0.A tense tactical battle ensued in the fourth frame. An early missed black by Asif and a blocked pocket led to cautious play.\n\nFollowing a fluke, Damani gained lead. Crucial exchanges near the black saw Asif inadvertently pot it, committing a foul. The frame remained tight, but Asif missed a seemingly straightforward blue when well-placed to win it. Damani capitalised on this error and later potted a fortunate pink to level the match 2-2, securing the closely contested frame 52-40.\n\nMomentum swung firmly to Damani in the fifth frame. Both players struggled for fluency, but the Indian built a 49-17 lead through better safety play. Although Asif reduced the deficit, a crucial foul left him needing snookers. Damani held his nerve to pot the pink and take the lead for the first time (3-2).\n\nFacing elimination, Asif produced a commanding performance in the penultimate frame. He constructed breaks of 32 and 29 to build a substantial 63-point lead. Damani fought for snookers, but Asif displayed remarkable resolve and endurance to close out the frame and force the decider.\n\nThe veteran started the decider focused, making a 15 break. Damani had a brief chance but missed a straightforward shot after scoring only nine points. Asif added 19 more. A sloppy safety from Damani then gifted Asif the decisive opening. The maestro seized it, constructing a vital 40 break. As he secured a decisive lead, an elated “Yes!” escaped him, met by crowd applause. Recognizing the deficit, Damani conceded, crowning Asif champion.\n\nThis hard-fought victory adds the prestigious IBSF World Masters title to Asif’s unparalleled collection, further cementing his legacy as Pakistan’s greatest cueist and a true giant of the amateur game.\n\nAhsan Ramzan, another Pakistani cueist, also continued to shine as he started his U-21 campaign with a comfortable 3-0 [59-2, 82-6, 74(57)-6] win over home player Mahmood Ahmed.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 20th, 2025",
