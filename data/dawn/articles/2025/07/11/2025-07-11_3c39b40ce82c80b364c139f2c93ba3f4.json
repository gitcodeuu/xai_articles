  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Pakistan faces a significant education crisis, with an estimated 25.37 million out-of-school children (OOSC) aged 5–16. Non-Formal Education (NFE) serves as a vital alternative, providing flexible and accessible learning opportunities for these children.\n\nThis was revealed in a report titled “Pakistan’s Non-Formal Education Report 2023–24,” launched at Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU).\n\n“This number [of OOSC] has risen alarmingly, influenced by the impacts of COVID-19 and recent floods. Recent years have witnessed significant developments in the NFE sector,” said the report.\n\nThe report was prepared by the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE) in collaboration with the Ministry of Education and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (Jica).\n\nFederal Minister for Education and Professional Training Dr Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui attended as the chief guest. Secretary Education Nadeem Mehbub, AIOU Vice Chancellor Prof Dr Nasir Mahmood and Director General PIE Dr Muhammad Shahid Soroya were also present on the occasion, along with others.\n\nThe report recommended the expansion of Accelerated Learning Programs (ALP), prioritising the expansion of ALP (Middle-Tech) programmes due to their high retention rates (70pc) and their ability to provide both academic and vocational skills.\n\nIt also recommended strengthening youth and adult literacy and addressing regional disparities.\n\nIt also called for enhancing data collection and utilisation.\n\n“Continuously improve the quality and timeliness of data collection and utilise data effectively to inform policy decisions and programme improvements,” read the report.\n\nIn its findings, the report pointed out that 35,427 NFE centres serve 1,290,009 learners, with a notable 20pc increase in enrollment compared to the previous year.\n\nDuring the ceremony, Dr Siddiqui formally unveiled the annual report, terming it a vital instrument for policy formulation and database development in the field of non-formal education.\n\nFederal Secretary for Education Nadeem Mehbub also participated in the event. The minister appreciated the collaborative efforts of the Jica-supported AQAL Project and the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE), which contributed to the development of the report.\n\nHighlighting the significance of data, Dr Siddiqui noted, “Access, quality, and governance in non-formal education can only be improved through robust and reliable data systems.”\n\nHe emphasised that the EMIS (Education Management Information System) cell dedicated to non-formal education is functioning effectively and is instrumental in tracking progress.\n\nThe minister announced that the Federal Non-Formal Education Policy 2025 is currently under preparation, with the ambitious goal of achieving “Zero Out-of-School Children.” Work is also ongoing on the National Action Plan for Non-Formal Education 2025, he added.\n\nDr Siddiqui revealed that a comprehensive management framework and a standardised assessment system for teachers will soon be introduced. Furthermore, out-of-school children are being brought back into the education system through accelerated learning programs.\n\nHe reiterated that the Ministry is prioritising data-driven policymaking, which aligns with modern educational needs. “This report reflects strong coordination among federal and provincial institutions,” he stated, and praised the contributions of PIE and JICA as “commendable.”\n\nCalling upon all stakeholders, Dr Siddiqui urged them to make full use of the data provided in the report to enhance educational planning and outreach.\n\n“Education is the foundation of any progressive society,” the minister emphasised. “No nation can move forward without investing in education.” He said that special attention is being given to female education, noting that “educated women are being empowered economically, and their participation is essential for national development, as they represent half of the population.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 11th, 2025",
