  "content": "TEHRAN: Iran said on Thursday that 12 journalists and media workers were killed in Israeli strikes during the two countries’ recent war.\n\nThe media arm of the Basij paramilitary forces — a branch of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps — said the death toll among media workers had risen to 12 following the identification of two additional individuals, the IRNA news agency reported.\n\nThe organisation accused Israel of deliberately targeting media infrastructure “to silence the voice of truth” and suppress the “media of the Resistance Front” - a reference to Iran and allied groups opposed to Israel.\n\nThe announcement comes as casualty figures from the war have continued to rise, even after the end of the 12-day conflict, which began on June 13 with a surprise Israeli attack and saw an unprecedented bombing campaign that hit Iranian military facilities.\n\nDuring the conflict, Israel also attacked the Iranian state broadcasting service in Tehran.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 11th, 2025",
