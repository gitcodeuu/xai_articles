  "content": "BRUSSELS: The EU unveiled on Thursday long-delayed recommendations to rein in the most advanced AI models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and help companies comply with the bloc’s sweeping new law.\n\nBrussels has come under fierce pressure to delay enforcing its landmark AI law as obligations for complex models known as general-purpose AI systems that have a vast range of functions kick in from Aug 2.\n\nThe law entered into force last year, but its different obligations will apply gradually.\n\nBut as the EU pivots to bolstering its competitiveness and catching up with the United States and China, European tech firms and some US Big Tech want Brussels to slow down.\n\nThe European Commission, the bloc’s digital watchdog, has pushed back against a delay.\n\nThe EU’s executive arm has now published a code of practice for such systems prepared by independent experts with input from others including model providers themselves.\n\nIn the code, the experts recommend practical measures such as excluding known piracy websites from the data models use.\n\nThe code applies to general-purpose AI models, such as Google’s Gemini, Meta’s Llama and X’s Grok — the tech billionaire Elon Musk’s chatbot that has come under fire this week for antisemitic comments.\n\nUnder the law, developers of such models must give details about what content they used — like text or images — to train their systems and comply with EU copyright law.\n\nThe code was due to be published in May. EU officials reject claims that it had been watered down in the past few months due to industry pressure.\n\nCorporate Europe Observatory and Lobby Control in April had accused Big Tech of “heavily” influencing the process “to successfully weaken the code”.\n\nThe code will need endorsement by EU states before companies can voluntarily sign up to it.\n\nBusinesses that sign the code “will benefit from a reduced administrative burden and increased legal certainty compared to providers that prove compliance in other ways”, the commission said in a statement.\n\nNearly 50 of Europe’s biggest companies including France’s Airbus, Dutch tech giant ASML and Germany’s Lufthansa and Mercedes-Benz last week urged a two-year pause.\n\nThe companies’ CEOs accused the EU’s complex rules of putting at risk the bloc’s AI ambitions.\n\nThe EU will be able to enforce the rules for general-purpose AI models a year from Aug 2 for new models, while existing models will have until Aug 2027 to comply.­\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 11th, 2025",
