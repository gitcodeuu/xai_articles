Leaders of major political parties including Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl, Pakistan Peoples Party, Jamaat-i-Islami, Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, and Pashtun Tahafuz Movement were also among the participants of the jirga.\n\nMehsud jirga calls for halt to military operations; demands crackdown on criminals\n\nThe participants of the jirga expressed grave concerns over deteriorating security conditions in merged districts, particularly in three districts of Waziristan. They said that increasing incidents of targeted killings, kidnapping for ransom, bomb blasts and other acts of violence left civilians vulnerable.\n\nThey said that clashes between security forces and militants often resulted in civilian casualties and widespread displacement. They termed indiscriminate mortar shelling, forced evacuations and collateral damage to civilians as gross violation of human rights and deviation from state’s constitutional responsibilities.\n\nThrough a unanimous resolution, the jirga demanded immediate and effective action by state institutions including federal and provincial governments and security forces to normalise situation. The resolution called for a halt to military operations and shelling on civilian areas. It demanded crackdown on criminal elements, respectful engagement with tribal communities and launch of sustainable development initiatives in the area.\n\nSpeakers said that tribal people had always been patriotic citizens of Pakistan. Casting suspicion on their intentions or subjecting them to perpetual scrutiny under the pretext of security concerns was unjust and discriminatory, they added.\n\nThe jirga urged the state to integrate tribal people with dignity into national mainstream and ensure their inclusion in decision-making process to promote long-term peace and national cohesion.\n\nThe jirga was convened to discuss the worsening security situation in Upper and Lower South Waziristan as well as North Waziristan during the last one year. The residents of the region say that they face severe threats to life and livelihood, with markets deserted, schools closed and economic activities paralysed. They say that thousands of families live under constant psychological and financial stress.\n\nThe participant of the jirga said that they would no longer remain silent if their legitimate demands were ignored. They said that they would peacefully raise their voice at all available democratic and constitutional platforms.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 11th, 2025",
