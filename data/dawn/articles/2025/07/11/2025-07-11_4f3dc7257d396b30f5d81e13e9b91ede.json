  "content": "KARACHI: The Sindh government has taken action to address safety concerns in Lyari by evacuating nine unsafe buildings and beginning the demolition of one dilapidated structure.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, Senior Minister Sharjeel Inam Memon said the provincial government would provide three months’ rent as financial assistance to the affected families.\n\nThe move comes after a recent building collapse in the area claimed 27 lives, prompting the government to take measures to prevent similar incidents. The Lyari tragedy has raised serious concerns about building safety in the area. The government has declared 740 buildings as unsafe, with 51 categorised as extremely hazardous.\n\nThe provincial government has also formed a five-member inquiry committee to investigate the cause of the collapse and recommend preventive measures.\n\nThe senior minister said the newly appointed Director General of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) had taken a strong stance against corruption and negligence within the organisation.\n\nHe added that all SBCA officers were required to submit details of their assets accumulated over the last five years within 15 days. “This move aims to promote transparency and accountability within the organisation,” he said.\n\nMr Memon said that strict action would be taken against SBCA officials involved in the construction or protection of illegal buildings.\n\nHe further announced that the provincial government would introduce the Sindh Electric Policy 2024 next month, which includes a subsidy of Rs18 per unit on electricity in the Nooriabad and Dhabeji industrial zones to promote industrial development.\n\nThe senior minister said that the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority had directed K-Electric and other power companies to refund excess charges collected from consumers in April and May 2025. The refund amount is Rs4.035 plus 50 paisa per unit, providing relief to consumers.\n\nHe also said that the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency had launched a crackdown on illegal wastewater discharge at Sea View, directing teams to submit a report within 48 hours.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 11th, 2025",
