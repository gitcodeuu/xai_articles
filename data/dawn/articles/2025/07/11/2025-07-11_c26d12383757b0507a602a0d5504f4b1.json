A group of armed men had blocked the road and stopped the two vehicles.\n\nThe armed assailants boarded the coaches, checked the identity cards of passengers and forced 10 persons off the vehicles at gunpoint.\n\n“They dragged out 10 passengers — seven from one coach and three from the other — and took them away (to an unknown place),” a surviving passenger told Levies. “I don’t know what they did to them, but I heard gunfire as we were leaving.”\n\nAfter abducting the nine passengers, the assailants allowed both coaches to leave the area.\n\nSecurity forces suspended traffic on the highway and began a large-scale search operation to locate the perpetrators.\n\nAccording to sources, the attackers checked the CNICs of all passengers and specifically targeted individuals with Punjab addresses. They also opened fire on the coaches during the abduction to prevent any escape.\n\n“There are reports about the killing of nine passengers who were kidnapped by the armed men,” a senior police official told Dawn.\n\nThe Balochistan Liberation Front, a banned outfit, later claimed responsibility for the attack. A spokesman for the group said they had killed the nine individuals after blocking the highway between Musakhail-Makhtar and Khajuri.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 11th, 2025",
