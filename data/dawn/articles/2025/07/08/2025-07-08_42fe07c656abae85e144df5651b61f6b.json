  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (OGDCL) announced on Monday a significant boost in production from an operational well in Chakwal district, Punjab, with crude output nearly tripling and gas production doubling.\n\nAccording to a company statement, oil production from Rajian Well-05 has increased to 3,100 barrels per day (bpd) and gas output to one million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) following the installation of an Electrical Submersible Pump (ESP).\n\nBefore this intervention, the well had been producing 820 bpd of oil and 0.5 mmcfd of gas.\n\nThe enhancement is part of OGDCL’s ongoing efforts to optimise domestic energy resources.\n\nThe Rajian Field, located in Chakwal and held under the Gujar Khan Exploration Licence, is 100pc owned and operated by OGDCL.\n\nDiscovered in August 1994, it remains a strategic asset in the company’s production portfolio.\n\nTwo other wells in the field have already been completed using ESPs.\n\nThe success of Rajian Well-05, the company said, reinforced its strategy of leveraging targeted, data-driven redevelopment to maximise output from existing fields.\n\nWhile Artificial Lift Systems have typically been used on shut-in or low-producing wells, OGDCL is now selectively applying them to naturally flowing wells where technical and economic analysis supports such enhancements.\n\nThe approach aligns with international best practices and reflects OGDCL’s broader commitment to increasing recovery rates and production efficiency across its assets.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
