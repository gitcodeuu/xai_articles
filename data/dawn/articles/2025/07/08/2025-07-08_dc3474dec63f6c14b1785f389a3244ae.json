  "content": "MOSCOW: An investigative committee in Russia has found that former transport minister Roman Starovoyt killed himself on Monday, hours after being officially dismissed by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nAuthorities said Starovoyt’s body was found in a Moscow suburb after the firing was announced with “suicide” being considered as the most likely cause of death.\n\nStarovoyt, who was 53, served as Russia’s transport minister since May 2024. He was previously the governor of the Kursk region, where Russia had battled a Ukrainian incursion.\n\nRussian state media also speculated the firing was linked to corruption in the Kursk region and a possible criminal case on the embezzlement of funds meant for fortifications in the border region.\n\nStarovoyt found shot dead in his car, probe body says\n\n“Today, the body of former transport minister Roman Starovoyt was found in his private car with a gunshot wound in the Odintsovo district,” the investigative committee said in a statement.\n\n“The main version (considered) is suicide,” it added.\n\nWhile Russian state media and news agencies said Starovoyt shot himself, it was not clear exactly when Starovoyt died.\n\nHours earlier, the Kremlin published a decree signed by Putin to relieve Starovoyt of his duties. It said: “Roman Starovoyt was relieved of the post of Minister of Transport.”\n\nStarovoyt’s firing came after another weekend of travel chaos at Russian airports following Ukrainian drone attacks.\n\nWhile Russian state media stated the firing was linked to corruption and a possible criminal case on the embezzlement of funds, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was “not linked to a loss of trust”.\n\nShortly after the Kremlin announced the dismissal, Putin met one of Starovoyt’s deputies, Andrei Nikitin, to appoint him as acting transport minister.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
