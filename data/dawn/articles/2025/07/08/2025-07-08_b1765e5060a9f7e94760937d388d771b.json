  "content": "LAHORE: JUI-F chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday assured traders of his party’s support against a “Punjab government plan to demolish markets and shops” on Circular Road under a project aimed at restoration of old city.\n\nHe reportedly gave the assurance during a meeting with the Joint Action Committee consisting of Circular Road traders, which met him to seek his support against the project.\n\nThe Maulana not only assured the traders of his party’s full support, but also promised to convene an all-parties conference on the issue as well.\n\n“The JUI-F stands with traders on this issue. The recent budget has already caused price hike in the country and the common man is struggling to make both ends meet. The government’s policies are causing poverty,” the Maulana said and directed his party to send a delegation to meet traders to discuss and finalise the future course of action.\n\nEarlier, the delegation, led by Malik Khalid, briefed the JUI-F chief on the issue, saying the provincial government, under the restoration of old city project, plans to demolish around 20 markets situated on the Circular Road between Bhatti Gate to Aik Moria Pul (one-way underpass). These markets consist of more than 7,000 shops of chemicals, medicines, electronics, dry fruit, glasses etc. Hundreds of thousands of people depend on these shops for their living.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
