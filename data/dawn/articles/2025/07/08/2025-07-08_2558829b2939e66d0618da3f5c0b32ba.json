A flash flood had swept through the area. Rescue teams managed to safely evacuate all individuals. Those rescued included Mohammad Akram (70), Qasim (30), Omar (25), Shafiq (50), Qadir (36), Asim Ali (28), Ashraf (50), Abdullah (25) and Nasir Mahmood (18)\n\nThe rescue teams also saved several goats belonging to the farmers and transported them to safer place. The spokesman said the farmers had crossed the rainwater channel earlier in the day to reach their fields. The sudden surge in water flow caught them by surprise.\n\nThe Bayan stream originates in Indian-occupied Kashmir and enters Pakistan through the Narowal region.\n\nIn response to the rising flood threat, Rescue 1122 has established eight flood response posts across Narowal district to ensure swift action.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Syed Hassan Raza told Dawn that the district administration has finalised comprehensive preparations to manage potential flooding during the monsoon.\n\nEach post is equipped with water rescue and medical teams, boats, life jackets, life rings, and other emergency equipment.\n\nDC Hassan Raza said departments including Rescue 1122, health, livestock, civil defence, and revenue have been placed on high alert. Medical supplies, beds, animal vaccines, fodder, and temporary flood relief camps have been arranged in anticipation of emergencies.\n\nDistrict Emergency Officer Rescue 1122 Narowal Engineer Aurangzeb stated that rescue personnel are on 24/7 duty, and all staff leaves have been cancelled. A central control room has also been set up at the DC Office for public assistance and real-time flood monitoring.\n\n“We are trying to secure the lives of citizens in floods and natural disasters and minimum financial loss,” the DC said and added that all the responsible departments are alert for 24 hours on the instructions of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
