The relief camps were officially inaugurated the other day by Fayaz Zafar, who was accompanied by other activists including Mohammad Hilal, Mohammad Alam, Abid Ali Jan, Azizulhaq, Ifthikhar, and Qazi Fazal Wahab.\n\nThe initiative has mobilised more than 500 volunteers including trained divers, swimmers, first aid providers and rescue workers. They have stocked hundreds of lifejackets, locally-made boats (Jalla) and other essential equipment for rescue operations.\n\nMock exercise conducted to educate people on rescue techniques during flood\n\nThe initiative was launched in response to the tragic flood incident on June 27, when rising water claimed the lives of 13 tourists. “The June 27 incident was one of the saddest moments in our lives. We realised that government institutions were unable to handle such emergencies. It prompted us to establish a comprehensive rescue and relief service to prevent future tragedies,” said Mohammad Alam, a social worker associated with Mehr Foundation.\n\nThe project has also received significant support from renowned diver and rescuer Mohammad Hilal, who has saved hundreds of lives in the Swat River. “I am proud to be a part of this lifesaving effort. I will be available around the clock to assist in rescue activities,” he said.\n\nThe initiative is largely supported by local communities, who have generously contributed by donating necessary resources for lifesaving equipment such as life jackets, boats and other essential supplies. “The people of Swat have united to establish this permanent emergency relief service along the river,” said Azizul Haq, a local volunteer.\n\nThe volunteers of Mehr Foundation along with Rescue 1122 workers also conducted a demonstration to show how to rescue people trapped in the river. The demonstration was aimed at educating people on effective rescue techniques during emergencies.\n\nKILLED: One person was killed and 15 others received injuries in two separate accidents in here on Monday.\n\nAccording to Rescue 1122, a three-wheeler plunged into a deep ravine owing to brake failure. The driver, 28-year-old Salman, was killed on the spot while four others sustained injuries.
