As markets plunged at the time, Trump halted the steeper levies to allow for talks. That pause expires on Wednesday.\n\n‘Anti-American policies’\n\nAlso, in a social media post on Monday, Trump threatened another 10pc tariff on countries aligning themselves with the emerging BRICS nations, accusing them of “Anti-American policies” after they slammed his duties at a summit.\n\nOn Sunday, BRICS leaders described Trump’s stop-start tariff wars as “indiscriminate”, damaging, and illegal, drawing a quick rebuke from the pugilistic US president.\n\nThe 11-nation grouping — which also includes US allies Brazil, Saudi Arabia, and Indonesia — is concluding a two-day summit in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nBRICS members account for about half the world’s population and 40pc of global economic output.\n\nSome US allies inside the bloc had tried to blunt criticism by not mentioning Trump by name in their summit statement.\n\nSaudi Arabia — one of the world’s biggest purchasers of US high-tech weapons — even kept its foreign minister away from Sunday’s talks and a BRICS “family photo” of leaders, seemingly to avoid Washington’s ire.\n\nClimate financing\n\nEarlier, the leaders of the BRICS addressed the shared challenges of global warming on Monday, the final day of their summit in Rio de Janeiro, demanding that wealthy nations fund mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions in poorer nations.\n\nIn his opening remarks, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva blasted denialism of the climate emergency, indirectly criticising President Trump’s decision to pull his country out of the 2015 Paris Agreement.\n\n“The Global South is in a position to lead a new development paradigm without repeating the mistakes of the past.”\n\nA joint statement from BRICS leaders released on Sunday argued that petroleum will continue to play an important role in the global energy mix, particularly in developing economies.\n\nIn their joint statement, BRICS leaders also underscored that providing climate finance “is a responsibility of developed countries towards developing countries,” which is the standard position for emerging economies in global negotiations.\n\nThe BRICS leaders also blasted policies such as carbon border taxes and anti-deforestation laws, which Europe recently adopted, for imposing what they called “discriminatory protectionist measures” under the pretext of environmental concerns.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
