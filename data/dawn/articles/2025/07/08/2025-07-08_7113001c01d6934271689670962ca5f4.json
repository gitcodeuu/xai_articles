The suspects, identified as Saddam, Dareesh Mohammad, and Mohammad Ilyas, were held during a raid at a trade centre here.\n\nInitial investigations revealed the prime suspect, Saddam was involved in smuggling people from Peshawar to Libya, and then onward to Europe. He reportedly extorted large sums of money from the victims in the process.\n\nDuring the raid, officials recovered five Pakistani passports from Saddam’s possession.\n\nAuthorities also recovered substantial evidence related to human smuggling activities, including documents indicating connections with international smuggling networks and plans for illegal migration to Europe.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
