  "content": "United States President Donald Trump’s MAGA (Make America Great Again) base is up in arms after his administration effectively shut down conspiracy theories related to notorious sex offender Jeffrey Epstein that had become an obsession for the US president’s diehard supporters.\n\nTrump’s Justice Department and the FBI said in a memo made public on Sunday that there was no evidence that the disgraced financier kept a “client list” or was blackmailing powerful figures.\n\nThey also dismissed the claim that Epstein was murdered in jail, confirming his death by suicide, and said they would not be releasing any more information on the probe.\n\nIt marked the first time Trump’s officials had publicly scotched the stories, pushed by numerous right-wing figures, notably including the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s (FBI) top two officials, before Trump hired them.\n\nThe backlash was swift and brutal from his “Make America Great Again” movement — who have long held as an article of faith that “Deep State” elites were protecting Epstein’s most powerful associates in the Democratic Party and Hollywood.\n\n“Next the Department of Justice will say ‘Actually, Jeffrey Epstein never even existed,’” furious pro-Trump conspiracy theorist Alex Jones tweeted. “This is over the top sickening.”\n\nTrump has managed to avoid much of the direct blame over the fiasco, with ire instead being directed at FBI director Kash Patel, his deputy Dan Bongino and Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nBongino and Patel spent years pushing conspiracy theories around the so-called “Epstein list”.\n\nThe controversy has clearly rattled Trump, who defended Bongino and Patel on social media as the “greatest law enforcement professionals in the world”, without explaining why he had spoken out.\n\nBongino reposted Trump’s praise and was deluged with furious responses.\n\nBut the lion’s share of the fury has been reserved for Bondi, who assured Fox News in February she had the Epstein client list on her desk and would get to the truth — in remarks endorsed by the White House.\n\nBondi was already on thin ice with MAGA after distributing binders labelled “The Epstein Files” to influencers at the White House that turned out to contain largely already public information and no new revelations.\n\n“President Trump should fire [Bondi] for lying to his base and creating a liability for his administration,” far-right influencer Laura Loomer posted on X.\n\n“She is an embarrassment and she doesn’t do anything to help Trump.”\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt was pressed about the controversy and said that Bondi was actually talking about Epstein-related paperwork as a whole, sparking even more MAGA fury.\n\n“This is what happens when the dog catches the car. Or, to put a finer point on it, when you and the people around you become the very ‘Deep State’ you have spent years attacking,” CNN analyst Chris Cillizza wrote on his Substack newsletter.\n\nEpstein died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking. Trump — who has denied visiting the US Virgin Islands home where prosecutors say Epstein sex trafficked underage girls — said ahead of his election he would have “no problem” releasing files related to the case.\n\nIt is one of a number of schisms that have opened in the MAGA movement in recent days, with supporters angry over Trump’s announcement that weapons supplies to Ukraine would resume.\n\nTrump’s fiercely isolationist base was already upset at the president’s bombing of Iran’s nuclear sites and his statements calling for an easing of immigration raids on farms.\n\nBeyond its insights into the power dynamics that animate Trump’s supporters, the affair has raised concerns that MAGA disillusionment will damage Republican prospects in the next election cycle.\n\nThe row comes with Trump under pressure from the launch of a new political party by his estranged former close aide Elon Musk, who had a bitter public split with the president over federal spending.\n\nWhen the Trump-Musk feud blew up last month, Musk alleged that Trump was named in the Epstein files, but he later deleted his posts.\n\nTrump was named in a trove of depositions and statements linked to Epstein that were unsealed by a New York judge in early 2024, but the president has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nSupporters on the conspiratorial end of Trump’s “Make America Great Again” base allege that Epstein’s associates had their roles in his crimes covered up by government officials and others.\n\nThey point the finger at Democrats and Hollywood celebrities, although not at Trump himself.\n\n“What’s the time?” the world’s richest man posted on his social media platform X on Monday, alongside an image of an Epstein countdown clock.\n\n“Oh look, it’s no-one-has-been-arrested-o’clock again! “\n\nThe DOJ and FBI’s conclusions came after an “exhaustive review” of the evidence amassed against Epstein, who died by suicide in a New York prison in 2019 after being charged with sex trafficking, the agencies said in a joint memorandum.\n\nSix years later, questions continue to swirl around Epstein’s life and death and the multi-millionaire hedge fund manager’s connections to wealthy and powerful individuals.\n\nThe memo, first reported by Axios, squarely rejected one of the leading conspiracy theories surrounding Epstein — that he did not commit suicide but was murdered while being held in jail.\n\n“After a thorough investigation, FBI investigators concluded that Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide in his cell,” it said.\n\nVideo footage from the area where he was being held did not show anyone entering or attempting to enter his cell from the time at night when he was locked in till when his body was found the next morning, it said.\n\nExtensive digital and physical searches turned up a large volume of images and videos of Epstein’s victims, many of them underage girls, the memo said.\n\n“This review confirmed that Epstein harmed over one thousand victims,” it said, but did not reveal any illegal wrongdoing by “third parties”.\n\n“This systematic review revealed no incriminating ‘client list,’” the memo said. “There was also no credible evidence found that Epstein blackmailed prominent individuals as part of his actions.”\n\nEpstein’s former assistant, Ghislaine Maxwell, is the only former associate of his who has been criminally charged in connection with his activities.\n\nMaxwell, the daughter of British media baron Robert Maxwell, is serving a 20-year prison sentence after being convicted in New York in 2021 of child sex trafficking and other crimes.\n\nAmong those with connections to Epstein was Britain’s Prince Andrew, who settled a US civil case in February 2022 brought by Virginia Giuffre, who claimed he sexually assaulted her when she was 17.\n\nGiuffre, who accused Epstein of using her as a sex slave, died by suicide at her home in Australia in April.",
