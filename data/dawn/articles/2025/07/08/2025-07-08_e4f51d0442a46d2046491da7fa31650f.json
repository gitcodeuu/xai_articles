Kerr County, through which the Guadalupe River runs, was the hardest hit, with at least 84 people killed including 28 children, according to the local sheriff’s office.\n\nThe toll includes 27 who had been staying at Camp Mystic, an all-girls Christian camp that was housing about 750 people when the floodwaters struck. Camps are a beloved tradition in the long US summer holidays, with children often staying in woods, parks and other rural areas.\n\nTexas Senator Ted Cruz described them as a chance to make “lifetime friends — and then suddenly it turns to tragedy.”\n\nBut some residents were questioning the absence of more robust flood-warning systems in this region of south and central Texas — where such deluges are so frequent that it is known colloquially as “Flash Flood Alley.”\n\nExperts stress the NWS sent out timely forecasts, and climate scientist Daniel Swain pinned the problem on a failure of “warning dissemination.” San Antonio mother Nicole Wilson— who almost sent her daughters to Camp Mystic — launched a petition on Change.org urging Governor Greg Abbott to approve a modern warning network.\n\n“Five minutes of that siren going off could have saved every single one of those children,” she told AFP.\n\nAt a candlelight vigil in San Antonio on Monday night, Texans gathered to pray for the victims of the floods and voice lingering fears.\n\n“I was pretty shocked on the gravity of the situation and how big it was, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect that our rivers would rise so quickly,” said Rebeca Gutierrez, 29.\n\n“Hopefully there’s preventative efforts happening in similar areas to make sure nothing to this degree happens.”\n\nIn a terrifying display of nature’s power, the rain-swollen waters of the Guadalupe River reached treetops and the roofs of cabins as girls at the camp slept.\n\nBlankets, teddy bears and other belongings were caked in mud. Windows in the cabins were shattered, apparently by the force of the water.\n\nVolunteers were helping search through debris from the river, with some motivated by personal connections to the victims.\n\n“We’re helping the parents of two of the missing children,” Louis Deppe, 62, told AFP. “The last message they got was ‘We’re being washed away,’ and the phone went dead.”\n\nMonths’ worth of rain fell in a matter of hours on Thursday night into Friday, and rain has continued in bouts since then.\n\nThe Guadalupe surged around 26 feet (eight meters) — more than a two-story building – in just 45 minutes.\n\nFlash floods occur when the ground is unable to absorb torrential rainfall. Human-driven climate change has made extreme weather events such as floods, droughts and heat waves more frequent and more intense in recent years.",
