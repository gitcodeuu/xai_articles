However, he added that the damage from the floods was being assessed.\n\nHe continued that the Karakoram Highway was blocked at five different locations after flash floods brought massive debris and mud between Gilgit and Chilas of GB, suspending the traffic on both sides of the crucial route.\n\nThe GBDMA official said that the heavy machinery was being engaged in the road clearance work, and work was underway. He added that no human loss was reported from anywhere in the area due to flooding.\n\nZubair Ahmad Khan, GBDMA assistant director for Hunza in Nagar region, said that it was reported that the main road leading to Hopper valley had been blocked at Supultar Nullah due to a heavy flood, accompanied by mudflow and large boulders.\n\n“The flood occurred intermittently throughout the afternoon,” he said, adding, “The debris flow had now nearly stopped; however, the water level is still high, making it impossible to commence road clearance operations at this stage.”\n\nHe further said that the tehsildar, naib tehsildar, and Communication and Works (C&W) Department sub-engineer are present on-site, and the GBDMA excavator is available at the location.\n\n“Restoration and clearance work will start tomorrow morning, subject to further improvement in water conditions,” he added.\n\nGB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan ordered relevant departments to remain alert in view of flood situation, according to a statement by his office.\n\n“Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan has ordered all relevant departments including the GBDMA and district administrations to remain alert in view of the flood situation in different areas due to melting of glaciers and rise in river levels due to increase in heat intensity,” the statement read.\n\nDeputy commissioners and relevant officers should take timely steps to prevent losses due to floods, Khan said, adding that departments should utilise all resources to initiate the timely rescue and rehabilitation process in any emergency situation.\n\nOn Sunday, six people were killed while one person was injured amid flash floods and heavy rain across Punjab and KP, according to the Provincial Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs) in both the provinces.\n\nMore than 22 people were killed and 11 others were injured in KP in accidents related to rain, strong winds, flash floods and landslides since June 25, according to PDMA reports. Heavy rainfall and flash floods have wreaked havoc in the province, while 18 people were swept away along the Swat River due to a sudden surge in the gushing water.",
