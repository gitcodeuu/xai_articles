It’s something we’ve been trying to do since the tournament began.”\n\nDespite Mexico’s first-half dominance they struggled to capitalise on numerous chances.\n\nRoberto Alvarado and 16-year-old Gilberto Mora both tested US goalkeeper Matt Freese, with Mora’s venomous long-range effort requiring a crucial save from the American shot-stopper.\n\nThe US created chances through the slick combination play of Malik Tillman and Berhalter but could not breach Mexico’s resolute defence again.\n\nAlex Freeman came closest when his header struck Mexico goalkeeper Luis Malagon in the face and Diego Luna blazed the rebound over the crossbar.\n\nMexico — who won their record-extending 10th crown — cranked up the pressure after the break and got the second goal when Edson Alvarez powered home a header, though there was a nervous wait due to a VAR review for potential offside.\n\nHowever, the goal stood and the Mexican contingent erupted with wild celebrations.\n\nPatrick Agyemang had the chance to equalise in the dying min­­u­tes but his finish just missed the mark in a tense finale as Mexico held firm.\n\nUS coach Mauricio Pochettino told reporters that while it had been a painful night for his side the tournament had been excellent preparation for the 2026 World Cup, which the US will co-host with Mexico and Canada.\n\n“It was a massive lesson for us. It was an amazing tournament to realise in the way that we wanted to grow,” Pochettino said. “When you lose a trophy or you lose a game it’s really painful.\n\nBut the most important thing is to have our head up because I think the tournament was fantastic and we keep going, that is the way we want to build our journey into the World Cup.“\n\nThe win was Mexico’s second successive Gold Cup triumph.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
