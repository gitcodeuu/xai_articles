The migrants are now being taken to Crete, Greece’s largest and most populous island.\n\nSea arrivals from northeastern Libya of migrants trying to cross to Europe have surged in recent months. They mainly come from the Middle East and North Africa, including nationals from war-torn Sudan and citizens of Egypt and Bangladesh.\n\nLast month Athens said it would deploy two frigates near Libyan territorial waters to help stem the flow.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 8th, 2025",
