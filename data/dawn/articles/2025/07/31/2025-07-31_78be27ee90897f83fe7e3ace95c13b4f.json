Salarzai added that the curfew was lifted in the district after a two-day operation against the militants.\n\nKP Chief Minister Ali Amin Gandapur announced on Wednesday that a series of jirgas will be convened from August 2 to decide on future steps on a wide array of concerns among the province’s residents.\n\nBajaur district, previously a hotspot during the peak of the Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan insurgency, is once again seeing a surge in militant violence.\n\nOn July 10, ANP leader Maulana Khan Zeb and a police officer were killed there by unidentified gunmen. On July 2, a roadside bomb hit an official convoy in Sadiqabad, killing five, including an assistant commissioner and a tehsildar, and injuring 17 others, many of them police personnel.\n\nOn June 13, cross-border fire from Afghanistan killed a man and injured two women in Salarzai tehsil. In January, PTI lawmaker Anwar Zaib Khan claimed that militants from Afghanistan had captured 15 security checkposts within Bajaur.",
