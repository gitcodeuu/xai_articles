By 2035, we will also successfully complete our lunar mission and land on the moon.”\n\nIn a post on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Suparco on the successful launch and thanked Chinese partners for their contributions to the project.\n\n“This achievement showcases the soaring heights of Pakistan-China cooperation, extending beyond borders and into outer space, driven by a shared vision to harness space technology for the betterment of humanity,” the PM wrote.\n\n“The satellite will have wide-ranging benefits for CPEC as well as applications for use in agriculture, urban planning, disaster management, mapping of transportation networks and data acquisition in different environments.”\n\nPresident Asif Ali Zardari also congratulated the Pakistani scientists on successful launch of remote sensing satellite, saying, “Pakistan is proud of the capabilities of its scientists.”\n\nHe called the milestone “a bright symbol of Pakistan’s growing space capabilities”, extending his gratitude to the Chinese government for its cooperation in the successful launch of the satellite.\n\nSuparco Chairman Mohammad Yousaf Khan said that the new satellite would serve national priorities and “contribute meaningfully” to Pakistan’s sustainable socio-economic development.\n\nChina’s space programme has rapidly advanced over the years, achieving milestones like the Tiangong space station and lunar sample-return missions. Its BeiDou satellite system and reusable rocket development underscore growing technological prowess.\n\nIn April, PM Shehbaz expressed Pakistan’s desire to enhance cooperation with China in the field of space technology, adding that China remained the country’s “most reliable and strategic partner”.\n\nIn May, Pakistan became the first foreign nation to join China’s space station training programme, sending two astronauts for training under a landmark agreement with the China Manned Space Agency.",
