They can take their dead economies down together, for all I care,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.\n\n“We have done very little business with India, their tariffs are too high, among the highest in the world,” he added.\n\nCanada’s trade relations with the US also came under threat after Prime Minister Mark Carney announced plans to recognise a Palestinian state at the UN General Assembly in September.\n\n“Wow! Canada has just announced that it is backing statehood for Palestine,” the US president wrote on his Truth Social platform. “That will make it very hard for us to make a trade deal with them.”\n\nHe also signed an order on Wednesday to impose previously threatened 50pc tariffs on certain copper products and end a tariff exemption for low-value shipments from abroad.\n\nIt left out products like copper ores, concentrates and cathodes, bringing some relief to the industry.\n\nAs Trump’s deal deadline neared, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Fox News that Washington had struck trade deals with Cambodia and Thailand, but provided no details of the accords.\n\nThe US tariff hikes due on Friday were initially announced in April as part of a package in which Trump slapped a minimum 10pc levy on goods from almost all trading partners — citing unfair trade practices.\n\nThis rate was set to rise to varying levels for dozens of economies such as the European Union, Japan and others, but Washington twice postponed their implementation as financial markets gyrated.\n\nThe US leader insisted on Wednesday that the August 1 deadline “will not be extended” any further.\n\nSo far, Britain, Vietnam, Japan, Indonesia, the Philippines, the EU and South Korea have reached initial deals with Washington to secure less punishing conditions.\n\nWhile the US and China earlier slapped escalating tariffs on each other’s products, both sides are working to further a truce maintaining duties at lower levels.\n\nAlthough Trump has promised a surge in government revenues from his duties, economists warn that higher tariffs can fuel an uptick in inflation and weigh on economic growth.",
