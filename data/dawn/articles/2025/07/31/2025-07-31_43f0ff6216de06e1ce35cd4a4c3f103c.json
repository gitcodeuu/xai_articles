His remarks contrasted sharply with US President Donald Trump’s aggressive low-regulation “AI Action Plan” launched just days before and explicitly aimed at cementing US dominance in the field.\n\nChina released its own action plan at WAIC, following a meeting attended by delegates from dozens of countries.\n\nLi also announced the establishment of a China-led organisation for international AI cooperation.\n\nHowever, China’s foreign ministry did not respond to a request from AFP for details on the set-up of the organisation — including any international participants — and several foreign delegates said they had not been briefed on the announcement beforehand.\n\nAnalyst Grace Shao wrote it was clear AI was still in its “infancy stage”.\n\n“You can sense that vibrant energy but also the immaturity of the space,” she wrote on Substack.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 31st, 2025",
