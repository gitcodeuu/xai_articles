  "content": "LAHORE: Pakistan’s valiant campaign at the World Under-19 Volleyball Championship ended in heartbreak on Wednesday, as they succumbed to a narrow 2-3 defeat against volleyball powerhouse Poland in a fiercely contested pre-quarterfinal match.\n\nThe clash, held at Yunnusobod Hall and the Sport University Center in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, saw Pakistan exit the title race despite a performance brimming with fight.\n\nHaving topped Group ‘A’ and entered the last 16 as a threatening force, Pakistan pushed one of the world’s leading teams to the absolute limit but ultimately fell short.\n\nThe match unfolded dramatically across five intense sets.\n\nPoland seized the opening set 25-21, only for Pakistan to level the contest by clinching the second set 25-23.\n\nRegaining momentum, Pakistan delivered a commanding performance to take the third set 25-17. Undeterred, Poland fought back to win the fourth set 25-21, forcing a decisive fifth set.\n\nThe final set provided a nail-biting climax, with both teams battling point-for-point. Ultimately, Poland edged it 18-16, bringing the thrilling encounter to a dramatic close.\n\nPakistan captain Mohammad Yahya, 17, led his team’s scoring effort with an impressive 21 points, also registering the second-highest efficiency rating for the national side. Outside hitter Amjad Junaid contributed significantly with 15 points.\n\nMohammad Saud and Jabran added two points apiece from blocks.\n\nFor Poland, Maksymilian Lyson proved instrumental, top-scoring with 26 points throughout the match.\n\nDespite the disappointing result, the young Pakistani squad earned widespread admiration from global volleyball fans for their exceptional fighting spirit, technical skill and composure under intense pressure.\n\nTheir tournament run was historic, marking the first time Pakistan achieved four consecutive victories in the group stage of this championship, a winning streak only halted by Argentina in their final pool match.\n\nPakistan will now compete in the positional matches to determine their final ranking.\n\nSeparately, Pakistan Volleyball Federation (PVF) chairman Chaudhry Mohammad Yaqoob hailed the national team’s high-level performance in a press statement.\n\nHowever, he also raised objections over controversial umpiring during the match and announced the federation’s decision to formally protest by writing a letter to the international governing body.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 31st, 2025",
