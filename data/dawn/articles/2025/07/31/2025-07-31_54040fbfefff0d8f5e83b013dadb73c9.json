This year, he had been using intercity buses and trucks to transport drugs to various parts of the country.”\n\nIt said that for the past several months, the suspects had robbed trucks transporting cargo from Karachi to other parts of Pakistan, kidnapped drivers, and moved them to an undisclosed location.\n\n“After stealing the items from the loaded trucks, they would leave the vehicles in an isolated location in Karachi.”\n\nThe statement further said that law enforcement recovered 308,308 narcotic pills, three digital scales, a counting machine, two mobile phones, three identification cards used for smuggling, and a modern weapon from the suspects during the operation.\n\nThe suspects were part of a group comprising 20-25 individuals. The arrested suspects were wanted in cases registered in police stations in different areas of Karachi. They have been handed over to the police for further investigation, it added.\n\nEarlier this week, three terrorists, including the mastermind behind the November 2024 attack on Chinese engineers, were killed during a counterterrorism operation in Karachi’s Manghopir area.\n\nAdditional Inspector-General of Police, Counter-Terrorism Department, Azad Khan, said the slain terrorist was identified as Zafran, while two of his accomplices were also killed in the operation.\n\nSenior CTD official Raja Umer Khattab said that the operation was jointly carried out by the CTD and personnel of intelligence agencies.
