When Abro reached there, he found the three family members brutally murdered inside their home. He informed the brothers and the police, who arrived at the scene and shifted the bodies to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for medico-legal formalities.\n\nInvestigators collected two axes used in the murders and other evidence from the crime scene. SHO Billu said they suspected that the couple and their son might have been given sedatives before the killing, as neighbours told police that they had not heard any cries or sounds.\n\nHe said that during the initial probe, it transpired that the couple had married of their own free will in Lasbela a couple of years ago and Sakina’s parents were reportedly against the marriage.\n\nThe couple, along with their son, had moved to the city around eight months ago, he said.\n\nThe SHO added that there were also reports that Sakina’s family had reached an “understanding” and they had also visited them in the city around a month ago.\n\nHe said that Sakina’s brother had also been seen shopping with the couple in the Ghaghar Phatak area on Tuesday.\n\nHowever, it appeared that the relatives had not truly resolved their differences with the couple as preliminary investigations revealed the triple murder was allegedly carried out by Sakina’s relatives, the SHO said.\n\nThe police were awaiting for legal heirs to lodge an FIR and initiate formal legal proceedings.\n\nMeanwhile, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah took notice of the incident and ordered an immediate inquiry and the arrest of the killers, said a spokesperson.\n\nSeparately, Home Minister Ziaul Hasan Lanjar also ordered an inquiry to ascertain every possible aspect of the gruesome murder and the immediate arrest of the killers.\n\nThe home minister also directed that peace in the area be ensured, the spokesperson added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 31st, 2025",
