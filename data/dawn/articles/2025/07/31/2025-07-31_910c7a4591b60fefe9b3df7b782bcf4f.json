They make us thirsty in order to expel us, and their aim is to expel people,” he said.\n\nResidents of Susiya accuse Israeli settlers of severing water pipes and electricity wires, chopping down their olive trees and preventing them from herding their sheep.\n\nIn response to a Reuters request for a comment on settler attacks in Susiya, the Israeli military said soldiers have been dispatched to deal with any troubles and have removed Israeli citizens involved.\n\n“As for the most recent incident that occurred on Monday (July 28), same protocol was used, and no injuries were reported,” the army said.\n\nOlive trees and Palestinian identity\n\nPalestinians have cultivated olive trees for generations and regard them as an enduring symbol of their national identity.\n\nSome villagers, like Najah Mughnem, are defiant and say they will remain attached to their land and their olives no matter what the settlers do.\n\n“Even if they burn down or cut down the trees or inflict damage, we will not leave,” she said.\n\nB’Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization, has reported around 54 settler attacks on the village since October 7, 2023.\n\n“We are afraid… We spend the days and nights nervous, we hardly sleep,” said Fawziyeh Al-Nawajaa, 58, a Susiya villager.\n\nSusiya residents have faced threats of demolition for decades. Palestinians there were so attached to their lands that they once lived in caves until they were expelled in 1986 after an archaeological site was discovered.\n\nThe caves were later destroyed and they now live in tents and prefabricated buildings.\n\nThe village is spread across several rocky hillsides between a Jewish settlement to the south and a Jewish archaeological site to the north — land Israel has occupied since the 1967 Middle East war.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 31st, 2025",
