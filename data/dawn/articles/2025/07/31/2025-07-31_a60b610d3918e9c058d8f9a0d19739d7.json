Notably, private companies that failed to fulfill their responsibilities in the previous year will now be required to accommodate affected individuals in 2026.\n\nThe meeting approved third-party validation for all Haj operations, real-time monitoring of payments and application processes under private operators, mandatory minimum of 2,000 pilgrims per private company, 1,000 seats reserved for hardship cases, enha­nced digital tools including Pak Haj mobile app, digital wristbands, and mobile SIMs for better tracking and service delivery, transparent selection of assistants through competitive testing, emer­g­e­ncy compensation mechanisms and upgraded lodging and food arrangements.\n\nNational AI Policy\n\nIn another major decision, the cabinet unanimously approved the National AI Policy 2025 to create a complete AI ecosystem in Pakistan.\n\nThe policy aims to democratise access to artificial intelligence, enhance public services, and open up new employment and innovation avenues.\n\n“Our youth are Pakistan’s greatest asset. Providing them with education, skills, and equal opportunities in AI is a top priority,” said the prime minister.\n\nThe AI policy outlines to train 1 million AI professionals by 2030, establish an AI Innovation Fund and AI Venture Fund to boost private sector involvement, create 50,000 AI-driven civic projects and 1,000 local AI products in the next five years, distribute 3,000 annual AI scholarships.\n\nAdditi­onally, it aims to facilitate 1,000 research projects, promote inclusion of women and differently-abled individuals through accessible education and financing, strengthen cybersecurity and national data security protocols, promote global partnerships and compliance with international AI regulations.\n\nHowever, an AI Council and a comprehensive Master Plan and Action Matrix will oversee the policy’s implementation.\n\nThe cabinet also ratified decisions made in earlier sessions of the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation and the Committee on Legislative Business, held on July 8, 17, and 25, respectively.\n\nBuilding codes\n\nThe federal cabinet also approved the Green Building Code of Pakistan (GBCP) and the Rainwater Harvesting Provisions for Building Code of Pakistan.\n\nThese new national standards will ensure green, energy-efficient and water-conserving buildings.\n\nThe GBCP applies to all new buildings, with four plus floors, emphasising energy conservation, solar design, green roofs, energy efficient lighting, and integration of renewable energy sources etc.\n\nIt mandates the use of eco-friendly materials and Building Information Modeling (BIM) for efficient building management, significantly reducing energy consumption and enhancing indoor environmental quality.\n\nThe Rainwater Harvesting Code applies to residential, commercial and industrial buildings, mandating systems to collect, filter, and reuse rainwater.\n\nThis initiative aims to address Pakistan’s escalating water scarcity by promoting groundwater recharge and reducing dependency on municipal water supplies.\n\nThe codes, now approved as Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) Bye-Laws, align with the United Nations Sustainable Devel­op­m­ent Goals (SDGs).\n\nThey represent a pivotal move toward sustainable, climate-resilient infrastructure and will be greatly beneficial for a greener, energy efficient and more climate-resilient Pakistan, improving better quality of life for Pakistani citizens as well as the planet.\n\nSugar price\n\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif warned that any violation of the agreed sugar prices will lead to severe action as no one would be allowed to exploit the public economically.\n\nThe premier, chairing a meeting, underscored the government’s commitment to ensuring fair prices and protecting citizens from economic exploitation.\n\nThe PM issued strict directives for the enforcement of the agreement reached between the Pakistan Sugar Mills Association (PSMA) and the government.\n\nAccording to the agreement, the ex-mill price of sugar is set at Rs165 per kilogram, while the retail price must not exceed Rs173 per kilogram.\n\nThe officials also briefed the PM on ongoing operations against those involved in creating an artificial shortage of sugar.\n\nThe government reiterated its resolve to continue crackdown on hoarders and manipulators in the market.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 31st, 2025",
