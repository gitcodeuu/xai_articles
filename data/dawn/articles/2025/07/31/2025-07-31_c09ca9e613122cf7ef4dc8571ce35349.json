I’ve never seen such heat… I’ve never seen such heat anywhere.”\n\nHe is getting through the heatwave thanks to the air conditioner in his shop, but is now worried about paying for the electricity.\n\n“My bill last month was 59,000 lira (1,450 dollars). We are asking for state support on this issue.”\n\nBefore Friday’s record, the previous peak in Turkiye had been 49.5C in August 2023. Scientists agree that climate change caused by humans burning fossil fuels is increasing the likelihood, length and intensity of heatwaves.\n\n“The heat has reached a point where it’s incomparable to previous years,” said Halil Coskun, 52, a local reporter.\n\nThe country is still in the grip of the heatwave and since Sunday temperatures overall have surged from six to 12 degrees above seasonal norms, according to the state meteorology directorate.\n\nWildfires\n\nTurkiye has fought fires in several regions since the start of the summer.\n\nLast week, 10 people perished while fighting a fire in Eskisehir province.\n\nPresident Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday the country has experienced drier conditions than normal over the past five years as a result of global warming.\n\n“Extreme heat, low humidity, and strong winds are unfortunately increasing the risk of fire,” he said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 31st, 2025",
