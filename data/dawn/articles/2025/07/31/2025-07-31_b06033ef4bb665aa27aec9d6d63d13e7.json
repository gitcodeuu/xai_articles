The flood also damaged the water channel for the main power station and disrupted telephone and mobile networks in the area.\n\nMany affected families have been shifted to safer areas while officials have begun assessing the damages.\n\nA complete assessment of the disaster will be possible in the coming days, officials said.\n\n“The communication is cut off; therefore, it is difficult to know the damages,” Yaqoob Tai, a local resident of Ghizer, told Dawn.\n\nExperts said GB has experienced unprecedented disasters this year, noting that the frequency of cloudburst-triggered floods, glacial lake outburst floods (Glofs) and rapid glacier melting has increased.\n\nAt least 10 people have died and 12 tourists have gone missing in various recent events across the region.\n\nThe Babusar valley and Thore in Diamer have been the worst-hit areas.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Meteorological Depart­m­e­­nt issued an alert warning of more potential flooding.\n\nThe department said a wet spell is likely to affect GB in the current week, with scattered rain, thunderstorms and isolated heavy falls expected.\n\nIt warned that the weather increases the risk of Glofs, flash floods and landslides in the region’s vulnerable glaciated areas.\n\nThe PMD suggested all concerned authorities “remain alert and take necessary measures to avoid any untoward situation”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 31st, 2025",
