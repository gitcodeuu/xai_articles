The resolution calls for enhancing efforts by all regional and subregional organisations for peaceful settlement of disputes and to strengthen cooperation between these organisations and the United Nations.”\n\nThe FO said that as an active UNSC member, Pakistan sought to contribute to the promotion and maintenance of international peace and security, including through peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\n“The adoption of Pakistan-sponsored resolution would serve as an important instrument to achieve these goals for peace and security at the regional and global level.”\n\nEarlier, the FO said the signature event reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering belief in multilateralism and the UN Charter principle of peaceful settlement of disputes.\n\nIt said FM Dar would also hold bilateral meetings with the Saudi minister of economy and planning, UK minister for Africa, the United Nations, Commonwealth and Multilateral, as well as Thailand’s foreign minister on the sidelines.\n\nHe would also give an interview to a foreign media outlet and attend a reception hosted by Pakistan Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad for selected UN ambassadors and senior UN officials.\n\nSpeaking at the UNSC session, FM Dar said, “We call for an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire in Gaza.”\n\nHe added that Israel’s latest onslaught in Gaza had killed over 58,000 Palestinians — mostly women and children. “The humanitarian situation is dire, with civilians bearing the brunt of the violence and deprivation,” Dar said.\n\n“Today’s debate is both timely and urgent. Multilateralism is not merely a diplomatic convenience; it is the need of the hour. Peaceful settlement of disputes is not just a principle; it is the lifeline of global stability,” Dar continued.\n\nOn the issue of Kashmir, Dar said that the final disposition of the dispute has to be made in line with the relevant UNSC resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.\n\n“No cosmetic measures can serve as a substitute for the fundamental and inalienable right to self-determination of the Kashmiris as guaranteed by the relevant UNSC resolutions,” Dar said.\n\nDar also spoke about India’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Water Treaty, saying, “It is most unfortunate and regrettable that India has chosen to illegally and unilaterally hold this treaty in abeyance on baseless grounds, with the intention of withholding the flow of water to 240 million people of Pakistan, who rely on it for their livelihood and survival.”\n\nThe Deputy PM said, “Let this debate serve as a collective reaffirmation of our faith in multilateralism, a recommitment to the peaceful settlement of disputes, and a solemn promise to those who look to this Council not for words, but for action.”\n\nUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres also addressed the council on this occasion, followed by statements of other member states.\n\nGuterres said that the “horror” facing Palestinians in Gaza under Israeli military attack was unprecedented in recent years.\n\n“We need look no further than the horror show in Gaza — with a level of death and destruction without parallel in recent times,” he said in a speech.\n\nGuterres said ramped-up Israeli operations meant “devastation is being layered upon devastation” with the Gaza Strip’s humanitarian system in its “last gasp”.\n\nHe commended FM Dar for convening the debate and for utilising the council’s presidency to put forward a resolution urging all members to make full use of the tools in collective pursuit of global peace.\n\n“This is needed now more than ever. The architects of the United Nations Charter recognised that the peaceful resolution of disputes is the lifeline when geopolitical tensions escalate, when unresolved disputes fuel the flames of conflict and when states lose trust in each other,” the UN chief said.\n\n“Around the world, we see an utter disregard for, if not outright violations of, international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law, international humanitarian law, and the UN Charter itself, without any accountability.\n\n“These failures to uphold international obligations are coming at a time of widening geopolitical divides and conflicts” with staggering costs measured in human lives, shattered communities, and lost futures, Guterres said.\n\nDiplomacy, he said, may not have always succeeded in preventing conflicts, violence and instability, but it still held the power to stop them.\n\nAdditional input from APP.",
