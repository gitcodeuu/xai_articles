Devastating flash floods in 2022 killed at least 1,700 people, affected more than 33 million, swept away swathes of agricultural land, and caused losses worth $30 billion, according to governmental estimates.\n\nThis year, floods and rain-related incidents like roof collapses and electrocution have killed at least 234 people, including 112 children, since June 26, according to a report by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).\n\nAccording to the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO), flash flood is “a flood of short duration with a relatively high peak discharge in which the time interval between the observable causative event and the flood is less than four to six hours.”\n\nIt is generally characterised by raging torrents after heavy rains, a dam or levee failure or a sudden release of water in a previously stopped passage that rips through riverbeds, urban streets, or mountain canyons, sweeping away everything in its path.\n\nThey differ from riverine floods in terms of their rapid onset and decline, high intensity, and unpredictability as well as their usually more localised impact in hilly and mountainous areas rather than the plains.\n\nThe Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has previously highlighted the danger to local and seasonal streams in areas like Murree, Galiyat, Mansehra, Kohistan, Dir, Swat, Shangla, Nowshera, Swabi, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Dera Ghazi Khan, northeastern Punjab, and Kashmir.\n\nBesides natural causes, a number of anthropogenic (deriving from human activity) factors contribute to either creating the conditions that favour the development of flash floods or increase the associated risk, such as settlements on flood plains, urbanisation, deforestation, and failure to maintain or manage drainage systems.\n\nA landslide, on the other hand, is defined as the movement of a mass of rock, debris, or earth down a slope. The term encompasses five modes of slope movement: falls, topples, slides, spreads, and flows.\n\nLandslides usually have multiple causes. Slope movement occurs when forces acting down-slope (mainly due to gravity) exceed the strength of the earth materials that compose the slope.\n\nCauses include factors that increase the effects of down-slope forces and factors that contribute to low or reduced strength.\n\nAccording to the NDMA, communities and individuals can take several preventive measures to reduce the impact of flash floods as well as landslides.
