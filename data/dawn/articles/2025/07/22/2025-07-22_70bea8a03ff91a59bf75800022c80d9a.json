He confirmed that at least 15 tourists are missing, with four bodies, including that of a woman from Lodhran (Punjab), recovered so far. The injured and deceased have been shifted to a local hospital.\n\nThe spokesperson said that the Babusar Highway was also blocked.\n\nCommunication and electricity infrastructure have been disrupted in the area. Mr Faraq said hundreds of stranded tourists have been rescued, while many have been given shelter by local residents.\n\nSenior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Abdul Hameed told Dawn that the situation is alarming due to the high intensity of the flood. He said the flood’s path stretched about seven kilometres. At least three tourist vehicles were seen being washed away.\n\nHe estimated that 20 to 30 tourists from different parts of the country might be missing.\n\nRescue teams are working to trace them, though operations are hampered by continued mudflow.\n\nThe flood also damaged a portion of the Karakoram Highway (KKH), leaving thousands of tourists and passengers stranded on both sides. Meanwhile, Gilgit-Baltistan chief minister has directed authorities to utilise all available resources to rescue and assist those affected. Agricultural land, crops, trees, public and private property, and infrastructure have suffered extensive damage.\n\nFloods hit Ghizer\n\nOn the other hand, flash floods caused by cloudbursts also created disasters in multiple areas of the Ghizer district. Local administration officials reported that the villages of Kanche and Salpi were particularly hard-hit, with over a dozen homes, agricultural lands, standing crops, and basic infrastructure destroyed.\n\nIn Yasin’s upper Thui area, brief rainfall on Saturday night triggered a flash flood that severely damaged residential houses and a private educational institution.\n\nSix homes were completely destroyed, and several others — including a school run by the Aga Khan Education Service — were partially damaged. Large areas of wheat fields, as well as apricot and cherry orchards, were also ravaged.\n\nFlood victims have appealed to the government for immediate assistance.\n\nIn Skardu, Rescue 1122 has placed Gamba station on high alert due to the rising flood threat in Bargi and Sadpara nullahs.\n\nThe floods damaged public and private property, agricultural land, and roads, and entered residential homes.\n\nDrinking and irrigation water channels were also damaged.\n\nBaltistan Commissioner Kamal Khan visited the area and mobilised machinery for restoration of water supply and roads.\n\nAdministration officials said rising water levels in the Khunjerab river have damaged the KKH at Passu in Gojal, threatening to sever upper valleys from rest of the region and cut off Pakistan’s only road link to China via Khunjerab Pass.\n\nGilgit-Baltistan Environmental Protection Agency (GBEP) Director Khadim Hussain told Dawn that Gilgit-Baltistan has experienced record temperature this year.\n\n“High temperatures and humidity have persisted for over a month and a half. These conditions are triggering frequent cloudbursts across the region,” he said.\n\nHe explained that cloudbursts are causing severe flash floods in the mountainous terrain, where mud and rockslides intensify downstream destruction.\n\nRains lash Mansehra\n\nIn the meantime, the monsoon downpour, which began in the afternoon, continued across Mansehra, Torghar, Upper Kohistan, Lower Kohistan, and Kolai-Palas for the rest of the day.\n\nLink roads in Kaghan, Siren, and Konsh valleys of Mansehra and various parts of Torghar were blocked due to landslides triggered by the rains.\n\nPDMA alert for Punjab\n\nMeanwhile, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) on Monday issued a flood alert for the Jhelum, Chenab, Ravi, and Sutlej rivers, warning of medium to high-level flows due to heavy rainfall expected between July 21 and 23.\n\nAccording to PDMA’s latest Daily Situation Report, the Indus River at Taunsa is currently at a medium flood level with inflows of 429,200 cusecs.\n\nPDMA has directed the commissioners of Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Lahore, Sahiwal, and Bahawalpur, along with the deputy commissioners of multiple districts including Jhelum, Gujrat, Lahore, and Faisalabad, to take immediate action and implement precautionary measures.\n\nImran Gabol in Lahore and Nisar Ahmad Khan in Mansehra also contributed to this report\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 22nd, 2025",
