A US intelligence assessment found that Iran was not actively pursuing a nuclear weapon programme and was “years away from producing one”.\n\nAraghchi, while saying there was no military solution to the dispute over Iran’s programme, told Fox News that “yes, facilities have been destroyed. They are severely destroyed”.\n\n“But the technology is there, our nuclear programme, our enrichment programme, is not something imported from outside that can be destroyed by bombings,” he said.\n\nTrump welcomed Araghchi’s comments in a post on his Truth Social platform on Monday.\n\n“Just like I said, and we will do it again, if necessary!” posted the US president.\n\nAraghchi’s remarks come as Tehran is set to hold new talks on its nuclear programme with Germany, France and the United Kingdom on Friday in Istanbul.\n\nRegarding negotiations with the United States to de-escalate regional tension, Araghchi said “we are open to talks” but “not direct for the time being”.\n\n“We are ready to do any confidence-building measure needed to prove that Iran’s nuclear programme is peaceful” in exchange for lifted US sanctions, he added.\n\nThe foreign minister also confirmed that Iran would continue to develop and manufacture missiles.\n\nDespite multiple barrages of missiles launched at Israel and waves of Israeli attacks on its bases and launchers, Araghchi said, “We still have a good number of missiles to defend ourselves”.\n\nBaier also asked about the health of Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has rarely been seen since the start of Israel’s attack.\n\n“I met him today, he is in a very good shape and in a very good health,” Araghchi said.",
