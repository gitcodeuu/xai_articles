  "content": "QUETTA: Balochistan National Party (BNP) President and former Balochistan Chief Minister Sardar Akhtar Mengal on Monday filed a petition in the Balochistan High Court challenging the government’s decision to place his name on Provisional National Identification List, a temporary travel restriction.\n\nThe petition was filed on Mengal’s behalf by BNP’s Advocate Sajid Tareen.\n\nA day earlier, authorities at Quetta airport prevented the BNP chief from boarding a flight to Dubai, citing his inclusion on the no-fly list.\n\nDuring a press conference at the Quetta Press Club, Mr Tareen alleged the action was political retaliation for Mr Mengal’s “refusal to compromise on regional rights”.\n\nHe said the goal was “to force them to abandon their principled stance on Balochistan’s rights and resource control”.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 22nd, 2025",
