  "content": "SAHIWAL: Around 25,000 acres of agricultural land has been affected in Sahiwal division following flooding in Sukhrawa and Beas drainage system caused by three-day rain last week.\n\nThe two channels saw 300-400 percent increase in water flow which inundated more than 55 surrounding villages in the division, with six the most affected.\n\nSE Mohibullah of Sukhrawa confirmed the flooding has damaged crops in villages 3/GD, 5/GD, Dil Bagh Rai, 29/2-R, 74 /D and 9/GD, 79/5L and Beas villages. It is feared that more rain in coming days, as forecast from July 21 to 25, may cause more damage.\n\nBoth drainage lines are connected with rivers Ravi and Sutlej at Chandni Chowk, Harrapa and Luddhan in Vehari.\n\nOfficial figures from Irrigation department reveal sharp increase in drainage water flow — from 300 to 1100 cusecs in Okara, from 700 to 1700 cusecs in Sahiwal at Sukhrawa drainage system, and from 200 to 1200 cusecs in Beas drainage system in Pakpattan.\n\nOmer Abrar, Executive Engineer, Irrigation, Sahiwal, said relief operations are going on. “Efforts are underway to redirect rain water into the Sukhrawa and Beas drainage channels to minimize flood damage in different villages of Okara and Sahiwal districts.\n\nIt is said heavy machinery like cranes and tractors were working for 24 hours to divert flow into traditional drainage system.\n\nThe Sukhrawa drainage starts from Halla village, Patoki, Head Baloki and falls into the Ravi near Chandi Chowk, Harrapa, Sahiwal, while Sukhnai Beas drainage system starts from BS Link Point near Head Baloki and falls into Sutlej near Luddhan, Vehari district.\n\nAbrar said irrigation staff are working to remove blockages and channel rainwater away from populated areas. He feared upcoming rain spell from July 21 to 25 will bring more water into the drainage system and water outflow will increase.\n\nHe said it is not possible to assess crop damage at this moment as water is still present in agriculture fields.\n\nCommissioner Dr. Asif Tufail is regularly taking briefings on the situation.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 22nd, 2025",
