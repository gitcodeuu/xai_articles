  "content": "KARACHI: Amid rapid digitisation and modernisation of banking in Pakistan, the number of complaints lodged by customers has surged, reflecting growing concerns over service quality and fraud.\n\nThe Banking Mohtasib Pakistan provided monetary relief of Rs882.25 million to customers by resolving 16,006 complaints during the first half of 2025 (January to June). This marks a notable rise from the same period last year, when Rs681.07m was granted through the resolution of 12,568 complaints — an increase of over Rs201m in relief and nearly 3,500 additional cases handled.\n\nThe complaints continue to pour in, with the Mohtasib’s office receiving 16,915 new complaints in the first six months of 2025, including 3,482 routed through the Prime Minister’s Portal. This compares to 12,568 complaints filed in the same period of 2024.\n\n“The number of complaints disposed of rose by around 4,000 during the first half of 2025 compared to the same period last year,” said a statement issued by the Banking Mohtasib on Monday.\n\nOf the total complaints resolved, 94pc (15,084 cases) were settled amicably, while the remaining 6pc (922 cases) required formal hearings and the issuance of Orders from the Mohtasib.\n\nTo safeguard consumers from fraud and forgery, Banking Mohtasib Siraj­uddin Aziz has urged customers not to disclose personal or financial credentials to third parties. He further advised that any suspicious calls should be reported immediately to the nearest bank branch or the bank’s official helpline.\n\nPublished in Dawn, July 22nd, 2025",
