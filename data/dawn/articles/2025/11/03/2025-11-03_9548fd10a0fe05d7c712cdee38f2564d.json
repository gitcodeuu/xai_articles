He said the reduction for the industrial units has been to the tune of Rs16 per unit.\n\n“We are also set to operationalise the Competitive Trading Bilateral Contract Market (CTBCM) in January or February next year to facilitate the electricity trading market,” he said.\n\nDescribing the move as the biggest reform in the power sector, he said, “This will free the government from the business of purchasing power and the consumers will get better prices of electricity in future.“\n\nLeghari said the government has also reduced the circular debt, with a plan to clear the circular debt of Rs1.2 trillion without putting extra burden on the consumers in the next six years.\n\nHighlighting the importance of digitisation, IT Minister Shaza Fatima said digitisation will provide convenience to people, ensure transparency, and save time. “People will no longer have to stand in queues for payment and transfer of the nation,” Fatima said, adding that people will not be able to hide their transactions\n\nShe detailed that digitisation was related to increasing the tax net and has an important role in increasing revenues.\n\nAdviser on Privatisation Muhammad Ali detailed the progress made for the privatisation of different state-owned enterprises.\n\nHe highlighted the privatisation of the First Women Bank, adding that the target is to privatise Pakistan International Airlines by the end of the year. He said several top groups of Pakistan are interested in the national flag carrier.\n\nPakistan faced a prolonged economic crisis over the last few years, marked by critically low foreign exchange reserves, an acute balance-of-payment crisis, and the looming risk of default in 2023. The crisis was averted after the IMF released a crucial loan tranche, while support from friendly countries, including China, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia, also played a key role.\n\nAfter averting default, Pakistan has undertaken tough IMF-prescribed reforms to stabilise its economy and bolster macroeconomic indicators. This year, global credit rating agencies like Fitch, Moody’s, and S&P Global raised Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating.",
