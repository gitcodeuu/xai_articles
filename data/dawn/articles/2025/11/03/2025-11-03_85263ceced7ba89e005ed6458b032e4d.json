Acts of violence or threats against journalists, he noted, are attacks on freedom of expression.\n\nThe prime minister also urged the global community, media organisations, and civil society to help protect journalists and uphold press freedom.\n\n‘Attempt to muzzle dissent’\n\nMeanwhile, pointing to recent reports indicating that Punjab and Islamabad had become the most dangerous places for journalists in the country, the opposition PTI described it as a deliberate and systematic campaign to muzzle dissent, criminalise journalism, and suppress the truth.\n\nPTI Central Information Secretary Sheikh Waqqas Akram warned that the ongoing crackdown on journalists and the press represented “one of the most repressive chapters in Pakistan’s democratic history”.\n\nHe said the alarming rise in attacks, arrests, and legal cases against journalists underlined the regime’s growing intolerance for truth. The PTI leader also expressed his anguish over the murder of senior journalist Arshad Sharif, whose killers remain unpunished, despite the lapse of several years.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025",
