Congratulations to our players,” Prime Minister Modi said on social media.\n\n“This historic win will motivate future champions to take up sports.”\n\nThe Indian cricket board announced the team would receive a reward of 510 million Indian rupees ($5.8 million) for their title triumph, a victory which the Indian Express newspaper termed “Herstoric” on its front page.\n\nHarmanpreet said it could be a turning point for the women’s game in the cricket-mad country.\n\n“We have been talking about this for many years weve been playing good cricket, but we had to win one big tournament,” the batter said.\n\n“Without that, we couldnt talk about change. At the end of the day, fans and the audience want to see their favourite team win.\n\n“It’s not that we weren’t playing good cricket, but we were waiting badly for this moment, and today we got a chance to live it.”\n\nThe fairytale triumph of the Indian men’s team at the 1983 World Cup is considered the catalyst for the country’s rise to becoming a powerhouse of the game, both on and off the pitch, and batting great Sachin Tendulkar said Sunday’s win was “a defining moment in the journey of Indian womens cricket”.\n\n“1983 inspired an entire generation to dream big and chase those dreams,” he wrote on social media.\n\n“Today, our womens cricket team has done something truly special. They have inspired countless young girls across the country to pick up a bat and ball, take the field and believe that they too can lift that trophy one day …”\n\nMithali Raj, who led India to the 2017 women’s final, said the victory for Harmanpreet’s side had made her dreams come true.\n\n“Ive seen this dream for over two decades, to watch the Indian women lift that World Cup trophy,” she wrote on X.\n\n“Tonight, that dream finally came true. From the heartbreak of 2005 to the fight of 2017, every tear, every sacrifice, every young girl who picked up a bat believing we belong here, it all led to this moment.”\n\nHeader image: India’s players celebrate with the trophy after winning the ICC Women’s Cricket World Cup 2025 one-day international (ODI) final match between India and South Africa at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai on November 3, 2025. — AFP\n\nNewsKit Publishing Platform",
