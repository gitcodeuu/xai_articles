His identity was not immediately known.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu defiantly stated on Sunday that Israel will continue its attacks.\n\n“There are still Hamas pockets in the areas under our control in Gaza, and we are systematically eliminating them,” Mr Netanyahu said in broadcast remarks. He threatened to “keep up action against Hamas” and added that any Israeli action in Gaza is reported to Washington.\n\nMeanwhile, Middle East Eye reported heavy gunfire east of Gaza City from Israeli forces, while troops simultaneously demolished residential buildings in the neighbourhoods of al-Zaytoun and al-Shujaiya. Thick plumes of smoke were seen rising from targeted areas.\n\nIn Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, Israeli artillery shelling and gunfire was reported, accompanied by demolitions of several residential structures. Isr­a­eli forces also reportedly carried out three air strikes on Rafah, in southern Gaza.\n\nIsraeli forces also detained at least 21 Palestinians during raids across the occupied West Bank on Sunday, including children, according to Wafa news agency.\n\nThe US remains deeply involved, with its Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Dan Caine, meeting Saturday with Israeli military chief Eyal Zamir. About 200 US troops have set up a base in southern Israel, officially to monitor the ceasefire.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s 20-point plan to end the war shows little sign of progress amid major obstacles, incl­­u­­ding demands for the disarmament of Ha­mas and a timeline for Israeli withdrawal.\n\nAttacks against Lebanon\n\nSeparately, an Israeli airstrike killed four people in Lebanon’s Nabatiyeh district on Saturday. Tel Aviv warned on Sunday it would intensify its attacks against Hezbollah in the country’s south, further unravelling the ceasefire.\n\nDespite a last year’s ceasefire agreement with the Lebanon, Israel maintains troops in five areas in southern Lebanon and has never stopped carrying out airstrikes, often claiming to target Hezb­ollah positions. The attacks have escalated in recent days.\n\nIn September 2024, an Israeli strike killed the group’s longtime chief, Hassan Nasrallah, along with other senior leaders.\n\nOn Sunday, Israeli leaders issued new threats. “Hezbollah is playing with fire, and the president of Lebanon is dragging his feet,” Defence Minister Israel Katz said in a statement. “Maximum enforcement will continue and even intensify.”\n\nNetanyahu claimed without evidence that Hezbollah was attempting to “rearm.”\n\n“We expect the Lebanese government to fulfil its commitment — to disarm Hezbollah — but it is clear we will exercise our right of self-defence under the terms of ceasefire,” Netanyahu told his cabinet.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025",
