Last week, terrorists kidnapped a police official from Bannu’s Havaid Adda area.\n\nSeparately, the Bannu police on Friday also claimed to have recovered Constable Noor Zaman, who had been kidnapped by terrorists in North Waziristan’s Mir Ali town. The cop was on his way to attend the last rites of his brother, Constable Javed Khan, who had been martyred in a gun attack in Bannu.\n\nFaced with the heightened militancy, security forces have also intensified counter-terrorism operations in KP and Balochistan.\n\nMilitants in Pakistan suffered their heaviest losses in 10 years during the month of October as security forces intensified operations against them, according to a report by the think-tank Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.",
