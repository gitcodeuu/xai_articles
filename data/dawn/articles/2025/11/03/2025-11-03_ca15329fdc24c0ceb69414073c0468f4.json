We welcome our countrymen,” Qureshi Badloon, head of the Information and Culture in Afghanistan’s Nangarhar province, told Dawn.\n\nThe repatriation of Afghan families with or without any travel or identity documents was abruptly suspended on October 11 following border clashes between Pakistan and Afghanistan, which continued for days before a ceasefire was formalised in Doha on October 19.\n\nPakistan had closed all its borders with Afghanistan for all types of movement. Since then, a large number of returning families had been impatiently waiting for the reopening of the Torkham border.\n\nTrade between the countries has remained suspended since then, leading to increased prices of essential goods, especially tomatoes.\n\nAlthough Islamabad and Kabul on Friday decided to extend the ceasefire, Foreign Office Spokesperson Tahir Andrabi stated that the “border remains closed for trade for now” and resumption of trade would depend on the security situation.\n\nOfficials previously said that all relevant staff members had been informed to ensure their presence on duty on Saturday morning. It was not clear whether Pakistanis stranded in Afghanistan would be allowed to return.\n\nMeanwhile, Afghan Consul General Hafiz Mohibullah Shakir told Dawn on Friday that thousands of Afghan refugees were stranded and living on the road due to the closure of the Torkham border crossing.\n\n“There are hundreds of vehicles, carrying thousands of refugees, stranded on roads from Nowshera till Torkham,” he had said, adding that many did not have access to food, water or shelter.\n\nHe had stated that refugees were continuing to be expelled, especially from Punjab, which was leading to an increase in the number of those stranded on roads. He had appealed for the provision of water, tents and food for the stranded refugees.\n\nShakir said the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) had not helped the stranded refugees either, most of whom he said were registered and held Proof of Registration (PoR) cards.\n\nFollowing the recent border tensions, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had asserted that the government would grant no further extension to Afghan refugees and that all refugee camps will be shut down.\n\nHe was informed that as of October 16, a total of 1,477,592 Afghan nationals had been repatriated.\n\nThe government has also warned that harbouring illegal Afghan residents wo­­uld be treated as a serious offence and violators wo­­u­ld face stern punishment.",
