  "content": "PPP Chairperson Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari said on Monday that a PML-N delegation led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had visited him and President Asif Ali Zardari, seeking their support for the approval of a 27th Constitutional Amendment.\n\nSeparately, the PPP also issued a similar statement that quoted Bilawal as saying that the proposal included setting up constitutional courts, restoring executive magistrates and the matter of transfer of judges. It also included the end of protection for the provincial share under the National Finance Commission and amendments to Article 243 of the Constitution, which pertains to the command of armed forces, the statement further quoted Bilawal as saying.\n\nHe added that the proposed amendment also included a provision about the return of the subjects of education and population planning to the federation and a point about ending the stalemate regarding appointments to the Election Commission of Pakistan.\n\nBilawal said a session of the PPP’s central executive committee (CEC) had been called after President Zardari’s return from Doha on November 6 for deciding the party policy on the matter.\n\nA subsequent post by the PPP said the CEC session would be held at Bilawal House in Karachi, where overall political situation in the country would also be discussed.\n\nLater, Minister of State for Law and Justice Barrister Aqeel Malik confirmed while speaking to Geo News that discussions regarding the amendment had been and were still ongoing, adding that, however, they had not properly started working on the preparation of a draft.\n\nReferring to Bilawal’s statement from earlier today, he also outlined the proposal’s salient features and provided brief explanations for their inclusion.\n\nThe state minister said the establishment of constitutional courts remained an “unfinished agenda” and also underscored the need for changes regarding the executive magistrate so that the burden on courts could be reduced.\n\nRegarding population explosion, he said the “menace” had to be addressed and it needed a “federal approach”. Similarly, he continued, a lack of cohesion was observed among provinces in the area of education in terms of quality and curriculum.\n\n“And even when we see this matter in the context of terrorism in the country — and there is also an element of radicalisation — I think there should be an oversight at the federal level,” he said, emphasising the need for a uniform and single curriculum across the country.\n\nMoreover, the minister pointed out that it was for the first time after the promulgation of the 1973 Constitution that an official had been elevated to the position of Field Marshal.\n\nChief of Army Staff Asim Munir was made Field Marshal following a four-day escalation between India and Pakistan in May.\n\nMalik said this development, too, had to be addressed in the constitutional scheme of things and recognised, making a case for amendments to Article 243.\n\nAsked whether the government intended to make amendments to this constitutional provision only with this intent, the state minister replied they had not moved on to the step of fine-tuning things yet.\n\nOn the deadlock over the appointment of the chief election commissioner, Malik was asked whether the government intended to end the role of the opposition leader in the process.\n\nTo that, he said it was not so, but the deadlock also had to be addressed. “If a situation arises that there is no opposition leader and the process is facing delays [due to that], you have to [find a way out.”\n\nRegarding the inclusion of the National Finance Commission in the proposal, he  acknowledged that it required political consensus, “which we are developing with our allies”.\n\nMoreover, the “present situation also has to be factored in […] and this has to be looked at from two to three different angles”, the minister added.\n\nThe government had last year passed a 26th Constitutional Amendment. It was passed by parliament during an overnight session in October 2024, with the PTI claiming seven of its lawmakers were abducted to gain their favour as the party opposed the legislation. The Balochistan National Party-Mengal (BNP-M) also alleged its two senators were being pressured, with both later defying party line to vote in the tweaks’ favour.\n\nEven though the 26th Amendment remains mired in controversy and faces challenges in the court, the power corridors in Islamabad are abuzz with talk of a possible 27th Constitutional Amendment, which, according to the insiders, will further “fine-tune” the structure and the functioning of the superior judiciary.\n\nIn August, however, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar had said during a press conference that the country was “running well” and experiencing stability and economic improvement, adding that there was no need for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.\n\nBilawal had also previously dismissed talk of any potential legislation regarding a 27th Amendment as “baseless rumours”.\n\nBut, the ruling coalition now seems to be steering in a different direction.\n\nThe matter of the proposed legislation had reportedly come up during an Oct 27 meeting between Bilawal and Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman. The two leaders had met to discuss the prevailing political situation and formulate a joint strategy on key national issues.\n\nJUI-F sources said that the focus of the discussion was to formulate a collective strategy related to new legislation and develop parliamentary cooperation between the PPP and the JUI-F. They claimed that Bilawal had stressed during the meeting the importance of the role of opposition parties in the upcoming legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition PTI has been criticising the proposed amendment.\n\nIn June, the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA) had also endorsed the amendment while calling for broad-based judicial reforms, including the nationwide rotation of judges. Speaking at a press conference, IHCBA President Syed Wajid Hussain Gilani had stated that the legal fraternity welcomed the 27th Amendment, which followed the precedent set by the 26th Constitution Amendment.",
