In similar remarks in February before the strikes, he said Tehran would rebuild its sites if they came under attack.\n\nIsrael launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran in June, kicking off a 12-day war that saw it target nuclear and military facilities — as well as residential areas — and kill many top scientists.\n\nIran retaliated with ballistic missile barrages aimed at Israeli cities.\n\nIranian Foreign Mini­ster Abbas Araghchi said in July, after the United States announced a halt in fighting, that the damage in Iran was “serious and severe”.\n\nPezeshkian’s comments came as Oman, Iran’s traditional intermediary, urged the two countries on Saturday to resume talks.\n\n“We want to return to the negotiations between Iran [and] the United Sta­tes,” Omani Foreign Mini­ster Badr Albusaidi said at the IISS Manama Dialogue conference in Bahrain.\n\nIranian government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani said Sunday that Tehran “has received messages” on resuming diplomacy, without providing further details.\n\nOman hosted five rounds of US-Iran talks this year. Just three days before the sixth round, Israel launched its strikes against Iran’s nuclear facilities.\n\nIran has since faced the return of UN sanctions after Britain, Germany and France triggered the “snapback” mechanism over Tehran’s alleged non-compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025",
