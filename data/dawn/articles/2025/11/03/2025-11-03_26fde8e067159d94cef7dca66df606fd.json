  "content": "QUETTA: The Balochistan government has asked the provincial election commission to postpone the upcoming local government elections in Quetta.\n\nOfficial sources said that the provincial government formally sent a letter to the Balochistan election commissioner, requesting the authorities concerned to postpone the Quetta Metropolitan Corporation elections due to harsh weather conditions and prevailing security concerns.\n\nThe commissioner was formally informed that Quetta was facing harsh cold weather and most of the people in winter travel to other areas of the country, mainly Karachi, to spend winter vacation.\n\nOn the other hand, the provincial authorities had also issued a threat alert in Quetta, due to which internet and mobile data services remained suspended in the provincial capital.\n\nEarlier, on October 6, a bench of the Balochistan High Court had rejected constitutional petitions filed by many people regarding postponement of elections of QMC and directed the election commissioner of Balochistan to hold local government elections as soon as possible.\n\nIn view of the BHC orders, the election commissioner had started preparation for holding of elections in Quetta. The Provincial Election Commissioner, Ali Asghar Sial, had announced all preparations for the election are underway and soon the election will be held.\n\nIn compliance with the court’s order, the Deputy Commissioner of Quetta has already been appointed as the District Returning Officer (DRO) for the electoral process.\n\nThe government maintains that holding elections under the current circumstances could hinder voter turnout and pose security risks to people.\n\nThe election commission is expected to review the government request and make a decision regarding the rescheduling of Quetta’s local government polls.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025",
