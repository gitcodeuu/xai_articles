He said the three accused served at different police posts in Bara and were immediately suspended from their services.\n\nMeanwhile, cricket players and their family members in Landi Kotal staged a protest against the recently-held trials for Under-15, 17 and 19.\n\nThe protest demonstration was held at Bacha Khan Chowk where players burnt their cricket kits along with supporting documents against what they called nepotism and favouritism in the selection of players during the trails conducted by the district officials of Pakistan Cricket Board at Jamrud sports complex.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025",
