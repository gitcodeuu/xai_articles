The initiative is expected to benefit more than 4.3 million people.\n\nDuring the meeting, also attended by additional chief secretary (planning and development) Ikramullah Khan and senior officials from the relevant departments, Mr Afridi issued directions for strict adherence to project timelines and provisions laid out in the PC-1, making it clear that negligence or delays would not be entertained.\n\nHe also stressed that complete transparency and merit must be ensured in the selection of project staff and beneficiaries. “Every rupee of public money must be spent transparently and for the intended purpose,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying during the meeting.\n\nMr Afridi said the project would play an important role in stabilising the provincial economy while creating employment and entrepreneurship opportunities in rural areas.\n\nThe meeting was informed that the project was aimed at development in three vital sectors which include agri-business development, skills development and employment promotion, and project management and policy support.\n\nUnder the agri-business development component, 550 professional farmer organisations (PFOs) are to be established, while the skills development segment aims to train and facilitate employment for 60,000 youth, 20,000 of whom have already been trained.\n\nOfficials informed that the project drew 58 per cent of its funding from IFAD, 16 per cent from the provincial government, and 26 per cent from the beneficiaries themselves.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2025",
