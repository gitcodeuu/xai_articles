A sanitisation operation was launched in the area to eliminate any “other Indian sponsored Kharji”.\n\nLast week, the deputy chief of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), Amjad alias Mazahim, was killed in an IBO.\n\nAccording to ISPR, Amjad was a deputy to TTP chief Noor Wali Mehsud and headed the group’s Rehbari Shura.\n\nPakistan has seen a surge in terrorist attacks, particularly in KP and Balochistan, mostly targeting police, law enforcement personnel, and security forces. The spike followed the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan’s breach of a ceasefire agreement with the government in 2022.",
