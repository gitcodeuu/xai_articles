The meeting was attended by Jeay Sindh Mahaz (Riaz) chairman Riaz Ali Chandio, JSQM (Shaheed Bashir) leader Dr Niaz Kalani, Jeay Sindh Qaumi Party leader Nawaz Khan Zaunr, Porhiyat Mazahmat Tehrik leader Masroor Shah, Qaumi Awami Tehreek leader Altaf Khaskheli, National Party Sindh leader Taj Mari, Sindh Bar Council (SBC) member K. B. Leghari advocate and others.\n\nAccording to Zain, participants of the meeting had a consensus opinion that the PPP was responsible for Sindh’s destruction, its resources and judicial system. The meeting decided to restore the Sindh Action Committee (SAC) and future struggle for Sindh’s rights would be led by the committee. The SAC would hold its meeting on Nov 17.\n\nThe meeting also resolved to launch a struggle against the 27th Amendment and the first Sindh-wide protests would be held on Nov 11 in the district headquarters.\n\nZain said that being a federated state, Pakistan is a multination state and the country’s constitution fully protects its federating units. Unfortunately, he said, different amendments were introduced in the constitution which were extra-constitutional in nature and they had damaged the country only for the sake of power sharing.\n\nHe said that One Unit was introduced in the past and a struggle in the past had led to the dismemberment of the country. He said that handing over taxes and mineral resources of the federating units to the federation would be a great injustice. He said such decisions would not be accepted in Sindh which were aimed at usurping Sindh’s resources and occupying its demography.\n\nThe SUP leader believed that forcible amendments were made in the Constitution. He said that 26th Amendment itself was a great injustice, which had put curbs on the judiciary, Pemra and media.\n\nNow, he said, the 27th Amendment was even more dangerous than that of the 26th. He said that the 18th Amendment, that was passed in the PPP government, was not yet implemented.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
