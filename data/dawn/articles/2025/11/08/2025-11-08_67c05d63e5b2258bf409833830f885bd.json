The incre­ase is mainly driven by a surge in prices of perishable products, including oni­ons, tomatoes, potatoes, wheat flour as well as edible oil.\n\nIt, however, declined by 0.59pc from the previous week, official data showed on Friday.\n\nThe prices of tomatoes, onions and potatoes saw an increase owing to disruption in supply due to closure of border with Afgha­nistan. The extraordinary spike in the retail prices of sugar, and meat also contributed in reversing the trend during the past weeks under review. The price of meat is steadily on the rise in the past few weeks.\n\nThe items whose prices increased the most over the previous week inclu­ded eggs (2.40pc), bananas (2.32pc), firewood (1.61pc), diesel (1.12pc), beef (0.93pc), tea prepared (0.92pc), petrol (0.91pc), bread (0.55pc), wheat flour (0.34pc), powdered milk (0.31pc) and cooking oil 5 litre (0.21pc).\n\nThe items whose prices saw a decline week-on-week included tomatoes (37.93pc), onions (4.88pc), garlic (3.23pc), pulse gram (1.58pc), chicken (0.68pc), sugar (0.64pc), gur (0.60pc), pulse masoor (0.55pc) and LPG (0.15pc).\n\nHowever, on an annual basis, the items whose prices increased the most included ladies sandal (55.62pc), sugar (43.67pc), gas (29.85pc), wheat flour (19.50pc), gur (18.88pc), firewood (14.25pc), beef (14.09pc), vegetable ghee 2.5 kg (11.53pc), onions (11.22pc), and diesel (9.29pc).\n\nIn contrast, the prices of garlic dropped 33.54pc, electricity (26.2pc),  potatoes (22.3pc), tomatoes (19.6pc), pulse mash (15pc), chicken (15pc), LPG (9.1pc) and pulse masoor (4.95pc).\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
