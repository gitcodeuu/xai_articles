  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Wateen Telecom Ltd, a leading ICT and connectivity solutions provider, has gotten its Long Distance International (LDI) licence renewed for another 20 years, following the resolution of a long-standing dispute with the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA).\n\nThe disagreement revolved around the Access Promotion Contribution (APC) related to the Universal Service Fund (USF).\n\nThe issue was formally settled through an order of the Sindh High Court on Oct 22, endorsed by both the PTA and the Ministry of IT and Telecom.\n\nHowever, several other LDI operators remain entangled in similar APC-related disputes, which have delayed their licence renewals.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
