It has century-old trees, historical railway sleepers and rare travel equipment.\n\nSpeaking on the occasion, the minister highlighted the recent reforms in the railways. He said digitisation of the railways was underway as per the vision of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\n\n“Safe and smart stations, cashless tickets and free Wifi have been launched in collaboration with Frontier Works Organisation (FWO) and Punjab Information Technology Board (PITB),” he said.\n\nMoreover, a freight online system, V-bridges, Rabita app and 117 call centre would facilitate the passengers and visitors to the historical station.\n\n“Information desks, escalators, commercial passenger lounges and quality food provision have been ensured in railway stations. Outsourcing of various services is increasing revenue and ensuring transparency in Pakistan Railways,” he said.\n\nApart from this, the minister said, Pakistan Railways will also protect the rights of railway employees during outsourcing of railway schools, hospitals and rest houses.\n\nHe said maximum revenue will be generated from a transparent auction of the railway land across the country.\n\nThe minister said that special attention was being paid to regional connectivity and in this regard an Islamabad-Tehran-Istanbul train service will be launched by end of the current year.\n\n“Kazakhstan has completed preparations for laying the missing section of the railway track up to Chaman. An agreement has been reached for railway connectivity between Uzbekistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan,” he said. The Asian Development Bank will fund the upgradation of the Karachi -Rohri railway track worth $2 billion. “Upgrading Nokundi to Rohri track will facilitate transportation of minerals to the port,” he said.\n\nThe Golra railway station was named after the small village Golra, which is famous for the shrine of a renowned saint, religious scholar and poet Pir Mehar Ali Shah.\n\nA heritage museum was set up at the Golra railway station in 2003 with an aim of preserving and conserving the rail heritage. The displayed objects dating back to 1861 included signals, meters, mode of communication, emergency equipment, Victorian furniture with classic crockery, long-arm rest chairs, clocks, watches and medical kits.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
