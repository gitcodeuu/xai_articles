Main bazaars and commercial areas also remained closed.\n\nInternet, mobile data and phone services were suspended from the morning until late evening, disrupting businesses and online banking. Access to the Quetta Press Club and the central secretariat of the Pashtoonkhwa Milli Awami Party was also blocked.\n\nDawood Shah Kakar, the provincial president of PTI in Balochistan, announced the cancellation of the public meeting on Friday afternoon. He strongly condemned the government for not granting permission, calling it an “unconstitutional and illegal act of the local administration.”\n\nMr Kakar alleged that the local administration filled the venue with water and “imposed an unannounced curfew in Quetta”.\n\nHe said the PTI cancelled its gathering “for the safety of their workers and supporters”. Mr Kakar added that a new date for the public meeting in Quetta will be announced soon.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
