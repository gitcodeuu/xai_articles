  "content": "KARACHI: An activist of the Awami National Party was gunned down near New Subzi Mandi off Superhighway on Friday evening, police said.\n\nSohrab Goth DSP Aurangzeb Khattak said that unidentified assailants forcibly entered 55-year-old Samiullah’s home in Janjal Goth, shot him and fled. He was taken to a nearby private hospital where doctors pronounced him dead on arrival, he said. Later, the body was taken to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for medico-legal formalities.\n\nHe said that the victim was affiliated with the ANP. However, he said it appeared that the murder had nothing to do with his political association. He suspected some personal enmity behind the incident. The deceased originally hailed from Bajaur.\n\nMeanwhile, a young man suffered a bullet wound while passing through a Korangi area during a violent protest against an anti-encroachment drive on Friday evening, police said.\n\nThe Awami Colony police said that the passer-by was identified as Ali Hasan, 25.\n\nThey said that he was injured when someone in the protest fired shots in their attempt to resist the anti-encroachment operation.\n\nThe wounded man was shifted to the Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Centre for treatment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
