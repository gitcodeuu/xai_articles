  "content": "RAWALPINDI: In a bid to improve policing effectiveness and make police services more accessible, the Punjab Home Department has sought proposals from all the divisional police chiefs on the rationalisation of police station jurisdictions to better serve the public.\n\nThe move also aims at establishment of new police stations or police posts, where needed.\n\nThe main objective of the rationalisation of police station jurisdictions is to ensure effective and accessible services tailored to the specific needs of an area. The basis of jurisdiction is the defined territorial area within which a police station has the authority.\n\nThese boundaries are typically established by senior police officers or provincial governments through official orders and rules. The goal of rationalisation is to improve enforcement efficacy. This includes ensuring that officers can quickly reach any site within their authority and effectively manage their workload.\n\nThe provincial police chief in a communication to the regional police Rawalpindi stated that the competent authority had decided to carry out rationalisation of the jurisdictions of police stations within respective regions and districts to facilitate both the general public and the police department.\n\nFollowing the Home Department’s directives, the RPO Rawalpindi and the city police officer (CPO) have asked all SSPs concerned to submit proposals and suggestions regarding establishment of new police stations or police posts till Saturday (today) to the CPO.\n\nA senior police officer said due to the urban expansion, population growth and for effective policing, the creation of new police stations was needed in the Rawalpindi district as well. Presently, there are 30 police stations in the district in addition to police posts, some of which are located away from the public reach.\n\nHe said though they had not formally forwarded the proposals, they had discussed the need for establishing new police stations in Rawalpindi in recent meetings.\n\nHe said they were of the view that the Saddar Barooni police station, which is located adjacent to the Police Lines Headquarters and opposite to the Civil Lines and Women Police Station, should be shifted to Adiala since its present location is not accessible for the citizens.\n\nAnother police official said in addition to Sadiqabad police station, two more police stations should be established - one in Shakrial and the other in Khanna area. Likewise, two police stations should be established in Katarian and Pindora areas.\n\nHe said it had been proposed that the Adiala Chowki should be converted into a police station (Saddar Barooni) to ensure citizens can easily reach it.\n\nBesides the shifting of Saddar Barooni police, the bifurcation of Sadiqabad police station is also under consideration. Moreover, establishment of a new police station in Bahria Town Phase VII and VIII was also under consideration since the two phases of the society have expanded into large areas.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
