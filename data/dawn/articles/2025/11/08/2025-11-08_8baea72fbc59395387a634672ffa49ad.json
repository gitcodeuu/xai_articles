He also highlighted the impracticality of implementing e-invoicing and e-bilty systems, and the adverse effects of Section 7E of the Income Tax Ordinance 2001, on the real estate sector, which he said had triggered capital flight.\n\nHe said the Fata/Pata tax exemptions had created two parallel taxation regimes that needed immediate correction. As both the KCCI and FPCCI have been advocating an electricity tariff of nine cents per kWh, he added, the issue of such exemptions should also be raised jointly from a unified platform.\n\nSaquib Magoon said that without collaboration, major issues would remain unresolved. He emphasised that the federal budget process must not proceed without formal consultation with the business community.\n\nThe FPCCI, Karachi, Lahore and other chambers should participate in budget-related discussions only when consultations are held before the finalisation of the budget document, he said, calling for a joint action plan.\n\nMr Magoon said the FPCCI and KCCI held similar positions on e-invoicing, e-bilty systems, Section 7E, and the Fata/Pata regime.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
