October’s remittances were 7.4pc higher than September’s, offering encouragement to the government, which is targeting $40bn in total remittances by the end of the fiscal year.Advertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayLoaded: 0%0:00Remaining Time -0:00MuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

Following improved diplomatic and defence ties with Saudi Arabia, observers expect a larger number of workers to head to Arab states.\n\nData show that Saudi Arabia, the UAE and other GCC countries accounted for $7.026bn of the total inflows during the July-October period of FY26. The largest contribution came from Saudi Arabia, with $3.32bn, marking a 7.1pc increase year-on-year. The UAE followed with $2.683bn, while GCC countries (excluding KSA and UAE) contributed $1.241bn.\n\nThe most notable growth came from European Union countries, where remittances surged 19.7pc to $1.737bn. Inflows from the EU surpassed those from the GCC and the United States, nearly matching the $1.856bn sent from the United Kingdom, which saw a 4.7pc increase.\n\nPakistan’s dependence on remittances continues to deepen as inflows now outpace export earnings. The country received $38.3bn in FY25 — the highest in two decades — which helped it achieve a modest current account surplus. However, that surplus was partly due to the rollover of over $16bn in debt servicing.\n\nThe current fiscal year presents an even steeper challenge, with $25bn in external debt repayments due. Analysts note that heavy debt obligations and a persistent trade deficit continue to prevent the government from leveraging strong remittance inflows to ease its external financing pressures.\n\nAlthough the overall 9.3pc growth in remittances during the first four months trails the 34.7pc rise recorded in the same period last year, the October uptick has raised hopes that inflows could surpass last year’s total.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
