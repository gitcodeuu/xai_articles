A breakthrough came after Turkiye and Qatar salvaged the dialogue process for the second time in less than a week, following Pakistan’s announcement on Oct 29 that the talks had “failed” and that its negotiators were preparing to return home.\n\nThe talks produced a three-point understanding — the continuation of the ceasefire, the establishment of a monitoring and verification mechanism to ensure peace, and penalties for violations. The operational details of that mechanism are expected to be finalised when the “principals”, senior representatives from both sides, meet again in Istanbul on November 6.\n\nTalking to the media outside Parliament today, Asif said: “The delegation has gone today and the negotiations will begin tomorrow morning. Let’s hope Afghanistan makes use of wisdom and peace is restored in the region.”\n\nHe said Pakistan had a single-point agenda, Afghanistan clampdowns on attacks on the former from the latter’s soil.\n\nQuestioned on whether there was hope of a positive development, Asif said talks were only engaged in if there was a possibility of progress; otherwise, it was a waste of time.\n\nSeparately, the defence minister said he could not share details regarding the reservations or the discussions taking place over the proposed 27th Constitutional Amendment, adding that the draft would take its “final shape” by next week before being tabled in Parliament.\n\nAsif said PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had a complete right to express his opinion on the amendment and that the government was engaging with other political parties in the same spirit to gain their opinion and input.\n\nThe defence minister, however, declined to comment on the rumoured proposed changes in the upcoming constitutional amendment.\n\nPakistan and Afghanistan saw a worsening of ties during recent weeks, which featured border skirmishes, counter-statements and allegations.\n\nThe hostilities began last month when an attack was launched on Pakistan from Afghanistan on the night of October 11. The attack had followed an allegation from the Afghan Taliban of airstrikes by Pakistan into Afghanistan — an accusation which Islamabad has neither confirmed nor denied.\n\nFor its part, Islamabad has long demanded that the Taliban stop terror groups from using its soil against Pakistan. The Taliban, however, deny the allegation of allowing terrorists to operate from Afghan soil.\n\nMeanwhile, Pakistan continues to grapple with the issue of terrorism and has suffered multiple casualties among security forces in intelligence-based operations.\n\nAfter the initial skirmish on October 11, multiple others took place along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. Meanwhile, strikes by Islamabad also targeted Gul Bahadur group camps in Afghanistan.\n\nEventually, the two sides came together for dialogue in Doha, which resulted in a temporary ceasefire, as well as a commitment to reconvene in Istanbul to work on mechanisms for lasting peace and stability between the two countries.\n\nTürkiye and Qatar have deep ties with Pakistan, while Qatar also played a major role in the negotiations between the Afghan Taliban and Nato forces.",
