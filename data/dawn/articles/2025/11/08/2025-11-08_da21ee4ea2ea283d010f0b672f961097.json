The AHCL consortium is among four pre-qualified bidders participating in the ongoing privatisation process of PIACL.\n\nThe board also recommended to the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation (CCoP) the inclusion of Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi airports in the privatisation programme. Under the proposal, airport management will be offered on a long-term concession basis to improve operational efficiency and attract investment.\n\nFor the privatisation of House Building Finance Company Ltd (HBFCL), the board endorsed a reference price and finalised the terms of the Sale Purchase Agreement for submission to the CCoP.\n\nThe HBFCL transaction is being carried out through a negotiated sale to the Pakistan Mortgage Refinance Company Ltd (PMRCL), which has been pre-qualified as a bidder. The CCoP and the federal cabinet had earlier approved proceeding with a negotiated sale to a single pre-qualified bidder in July 2023. PMRCL’s bid will be opened once the reference price is approved by the CCoP and ratified by the cabinet.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
