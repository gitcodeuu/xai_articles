He added that the team is ready to meet the challenge to qualify for the World Cup qualifiers.\n\nAmmad Shakeel Butt (captain), Abdullah Ishtiaq Khan, Muneeb-ur-Rehman, Mohammad Sufyan, Mohammad Abdullah, Hammad-ud-Din, Abdul Manan, Moeen Shakeel, Zakraya Hayat, Arshad Liaqat, Ghazanfar Ali, Rana Abdul Waheed, Afraz, Abdul Hanan Shahid, Abdul Rahman, Rana Mohammad Walid, Ahmad Nadeem and Junaid Manzoor.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
