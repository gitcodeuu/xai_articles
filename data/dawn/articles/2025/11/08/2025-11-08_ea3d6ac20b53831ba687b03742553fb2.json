Across the country, the top three districts for arrests and detentions between Jan 1 and Nov 1, 2025, were Chagi, Attock and Quetta.\n\nLinks the surge to reopening of border crossings; reveals Balochistan is epicentre of the crackdown\n\nThe rate of returns and deportations also rose sharply in the last week of October. According to the UN data, the number of returns increased by 101pc and deportations by 131pc compared to the week of Oct 19-25.\n\nThe figures climbed from 18,630 returns, including 3,341 deportations, in the previous week to 37,448 returns, including 7,733 deportations, in the week ending Nov 1.\n\n“This notable increase is primarily attributed to the reopening of the Chaman border, with Torkham also reopening on Nov 1,” the report stated.\n\nFrom Sept 15, 2023, to Nov 1, 2025, a cumulative total of 1,667,713 individuals have returned to Afghanistan.\n\nFor the returns from Oct 26 to Nov 1, the largest group was PoR holders at 47pc, followed by undocumented individuals at 44pc and ACC holders at 8pc. In contrast, deportees during the same period were overwhelmingly undocumented at 93pc.\n\nThe report found that fear of arrest was the primary reason for return among 93pc of undocumented individuals and ACC holders, and for 39pc of PoR holders, since April 1, 2023.\n\nThe recent activity follows several government directives issued this year impacting Afghan nationals.\n\nIn July, the government ordered the repatriation of PoR card holders following the expiration of their card validity on June 30, later\nsetting a Sept 1 deadline for them to leave Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
