  "content": "WASHINGTON: The United States accused Iran on Friday of “plotting to assassinate” Israel’s ambassador to Mexico, in what would be the latest attempt to take the two countries’ conflict to another region.\n\nA US official said the Revolutionary Guards’ elite Quds Force initiated the plot late last year and that it was disrupted this year.\n\n“The plot was contained and does not pose a current threat,” the US official said.\n\nThe US official did not provide detailed evidence or say how the plot was contained. The Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment.\n\nAccording to the US official, the alleged plot would have taken place after April 1 last year, when Israel attacked the Iranian embassy complex in Damascus, killing several top officers of the Revolutionary Guards.\n\nIsrael carried out a much more extensive bombing campaign in Iran this year that killed more than 1,000 people. The United States joined by bombing key nuclear sites. Iran has been a critical supporter of Hamas, which has ruled the Gaza Strip since winning an election in 2007.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
