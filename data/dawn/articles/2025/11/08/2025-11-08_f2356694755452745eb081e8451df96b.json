He said that while his country is willing to engage in dialogue, it will not negotiate away its fundamental rights to a nuclear progamme and a defensive missile arsenal.\n\n“We are willing to hold talks under international frameworks, but not if they say you can’t have a [nuclear] science, or the right to defend yourself [with missiles] or else we will bomb you,” Mr Pezeshkian said. “We want to live in this world in peace and security, but not be humiliated, and it is not acceptable that they impose upon us whatever they want and we just serve them.”\n\nThese diplomatic overtures are set against the backdrop of a recent and volatile conflict.\n\nIn mid-June, Israel launched an unprecedented bombing campaign against Iran, triggering a 12-day war that briefly saw the United States join with strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.\n\nThe war, which prompted an Iranian response with missile and drone strikes, derailed nuclear talks between Tehran and Wash­ington which had begun in April.\n\nThe Republican president, who returned to office in January, has repeatedly claimed the strikes obliterated Iran’s nuclear progamme.\n\n“Iran had once been the bully of the Middle East,” Trump said, adding that it no longer had the “possibility of nuclear weapons.” The full extent of the damage from the strikes remains unknown.\n\nWestern countries, including the United States, have long accused Iran of seeking to acquire atomic weapons. Iran insists its nuclear progamme is for peaceful energy purposes.\n\nAdding to the economic pressure, the United Nations in September reinstated sanctions against Tehran under the “snapback” mechanism after Britain, France and Germany triggered the process. Those measures bar dealings linked to the Tehran’s nuclear and ballistic missile activities.\n\nPresident Pezeshkian decried what he called a double standard, stating, “They supply arms to Israel while they tell us not to have missiles for defence, then they bomb us whenever they want.”\n\nIran has repeatedly dismissed the possibility of negotiations over its defensive capabilities, including its missile progamme, which it says is crucial for national security.\n\nIsrael sees Iran as an existential threat. But Iran says its ballistic missiles, with a range of up to 2,000 kilometres, are an important deterrent and retaliatory force in the event of any adverse situation. It denies seeking nuclear weapons.\n\nOman, which has hosted several rounds of US-Iran nuclear talks, has called on both sides to return to negotiations.\n\nThe talks had aimed for a new agreement that would curb Iran’s nuclear activities in return for sanctions relief. Prior to the war, Tehran and Washington held five rounds of such talks.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
