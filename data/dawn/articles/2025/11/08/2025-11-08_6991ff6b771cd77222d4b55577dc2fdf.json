Similarly, Majlis Wahdat-i-Musl­imeen’s Allama Raja Nasir Abbas was nominated for the Senate slot, left vacant by Mr Faraz.\n\nThe PTI parliamentary delegation that met Mr Sadiq at the Parliament House was led by party chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan and included former NA speaker Asad Qaiser along with other party members.\n\nAn official handout issued by the NA Secretariat also said that during the meeting, deta­iled discussions were held reg­arding the appointment of the leader of the opposition in the house and the speaker info­rmed the delegation that the matter was currently sub judice.\n\nThe speaker emphasised that parliament was the most important and credible institution of democracy, and all political parties should play a constructive role in strengthening it.\n\nHe affirmed his readiness to serve as a bridge between the government and the opposition for the promotion of national reconciliation, parliamentary traditions, and the consolidation of the democratic process.\n\nAmidst protests over the delay in appointing the opposition leader in the Senate, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told the upper house on Friday that the government had no role in the process.\n\nSpeaking on the floor of the Senate on Friday, PTI Senator Azam Swati  had expressed concern over the delay in nominating an opposition leader, saying the house was incomplete without one.\n\nResponding to him, the law minister reiterated that the matter was purely an internal affair of the Senate, adding that the chairman must satisfy himself as to who commands the support of the majority within the opposition.\n\n“We have seen times when the leader of the opposition was in jail,” he said, referring to Shehbaz Sharif’s incarceration when he was opposition leader under the PTI regime, and regretted that at the time, even his production orders were not issued.\n\nHe added, however, that he was not suggesting such treatment be repeated.\n\nThe minister urged opposition members to meet the Senate chairman in his chambers to find a way forward, and wished them good luck in reaching a consensus.\n\nSoon after his remarks, Awami National Party chief Aimal Wali Khan was given the floor, but was repeatedly interrupted by loud slogans from opposition benches protesting the delay.\n\n“I don’t know if they have a problem with me or with you,” he quipped, while addressing the chair.\n\nAs Aimal Wali continued his speech, PTI senators staged a walkout in protest, though their attempt to point out quorum failed after a headcount confirmed the house was in order.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
