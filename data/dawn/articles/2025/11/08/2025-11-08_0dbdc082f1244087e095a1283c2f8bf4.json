  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Over 7,500 women, including 1,553 in the name of honour, were murdered in the country in four years from 2021 to 2024.\n\nThis horrible data was presented by Minister for Human Rights Azam Nazeer Tarar in the National Assembly on Friday in a written reply to a question asked by Naeema Kishwar Khan of the JUI-F.\n\nAccording to the minister, the data has been compiled by National Police Bureau which shows that that 17,771 cases of rape and gang-rape of women were reported during the four-year period. The document reveals that 121 women were subjected to sexual assault during the custody.Advertisements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                X\n\nDuring the same period, 9,799 women were subjected to brutality by men within their own homes whereas a total of 632 cases of\nsexual harassment at workplaces were reported.\n\nThe figures show that a total of 173,367 different cases of violence against women were reported all over the country in four years. Despite government’s claims to have taken a number of steps to prevent such incidents, the data shows a gradual increase every year in such cases as 30,757 cases were reported in 2021, 35,477 in 2022, 46,036 in 2023 and 61,997 cases in 2024.\n\nTotal 173,367 domestic violence cases, including 1,553 honour killing incidents, reported\n\nThe data shows that most of the women were murdered in year 2023 when a total of 2,459 women were killed. The number includes 392 incidents of honour killings. Moreover, 127 cases of acid throwing were also reported during the four-year period.\n\nThe number of women kidnapped in four years remained very high with 89,599 such cases.\n\nGiving explanation, Mr Tarar, who also holds the portfolio of law and justice ministry, said the incidents of violence against women were noticed in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces due to entrenched societal norms and weak enforcement, which were being addressed through continuous efforts.\n\nHe said that appropriate action on such incidents, such as Shanti in Karachi and Sidra Arab of Rawalpindi, had been taken in accordance with the law.\n\nHighlighting various measures taken by the government, he said the violence against women remained a serious concern for the government, stating that the reported cases have shown fluctuations in different provinces and regions. He said there was a general trend of increased reporting of the incident due to greater awareness, improved access to justice mechanisms, and enhanced media coverage. This reflects growing confidence in the system to report such crimes, he added.\n\nEarlier, at the start of the Question Hour, opposition PTI lawmakers staged a walkout leaving behind Iqbal Afridi to point out lack of quorum in an effort to disrupt the assembly proceedings.\n\nHowever, Deputy Speaker Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah declared the house in order after a headcount. In order to maintain quorum, the presence of a minimum of 84 lawmakers is required in the house.\n\nLater, the PTI members returned to the house and participated in the proceedings.\n\nPTI’s Sher Afzal Marwat drew the attention of the chair towards the absence of the ministers from the house. He regretted that only a couple of ministers were present in the house.\n\nFederal Minister for Parliam­en­tary Affairs Dr Tariq Fazal Chau­dhry tabled two bills — the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Auth­ority (Amendment) Bill, 2025, and the Netting of Financial Arrange­ments Bill, 2025 — during the lacklustre proceedings of the house. The bills were referred to standing committees concerned.\n\nThe National Assembly will now meet on Monday evening at 4.30pm.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
