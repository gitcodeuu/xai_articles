But if it is purely administrative, we will review it first and then decide.”\n\nThe PPP, a major ally of the ruling PML-N-led government, on Thursday also drew a red line against any change to the provinces’ share under the NFC while indicating conditional support for limited amendments to Article 243 governing federal control of the armed forces.",
