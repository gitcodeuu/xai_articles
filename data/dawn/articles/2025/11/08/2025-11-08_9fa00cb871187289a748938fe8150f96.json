  "content": "ISLAMABAD: The International Financial Institutions (IFIs) have raised urgent concerns over Pakistan’s escalating climate vulnerability and environmental degradation, warning that unchecked population growth and dwindling natural resources could deepen the country’s fragility.\n\nThese observations and recommendations emerged during the closing plenary of the 28th Sustainable Development Conference held on Friday, where experts — including representatives from the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) — underscored the need for immediate action.\n\nWorld Bank Country Director Dr Bolormaa Amgabazar said that Pakistan faces alarmingly high vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters, compounded by escalating air and water pollution. At the same time, the country’s rapid population growth — among the highest globally — is placing immense strain on its already depleting natural resources, posing serious long-term risks to environmental and economic stability.Advertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPauseLoaded: 0.00%0:00Remaining Time -0:00MuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.
