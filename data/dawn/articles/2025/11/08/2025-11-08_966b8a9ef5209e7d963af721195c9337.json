Instead, it suggests passengers contribute to the purchase of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF).\n\n“There is room to change” in the way airlines communicate, said Diane Vitry, who heads up the aviation section of the NGO Transport & Environment.\n\nAviation accounts for around three per cent of global carbon emissions, but its overall contribution to climate change is higher because of the release of other greenhouse gases and condensation trails at high altitudes.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
