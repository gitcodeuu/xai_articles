He turned them into a song for the bereaved family.\n\nAnd Cho remembered a high school girl who lived alone in a gosiwon — a cramped room typically less than five square metres — after she escaped domestic violence.\n\nHe visited once a month to clean. The teenager, suffering from depression, had been unable to tidy up herself.\n\nPiles of belongings and rotting food covered the bed, and the air was thick with flies.\n\nBut she carefully looked after a small box, insisting Cho never throw it away.\n\nShe took her own life in that small room a year later.\n\nWhen Cho returned to clean, he found that a hamster had been living in the box all along.\n\nBeside it sat her guitar — she had dreamed of becoming a musician.\n\n“The moment I saw the hamster, all I could think was that I had to save it and keep it alive,” Cho said.\n\nKim Doo-nyeon, a veteran in the funeral business, said he has a growing number of recruits in their twenties.\n\n“When people live together, they share things… even if one person dies, those items remain,” he said.\n\n“But when someone dies alone, everything must be cleared away.”\n\nBack at class in Busan, I’m admitted to some trepidation about his chosen career path.\n\n“I am scared,” he said.\n\n“No matter how much you prepare, facing a deceased person is frightening.”",
