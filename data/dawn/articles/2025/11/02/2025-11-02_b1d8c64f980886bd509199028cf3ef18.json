To ensure transparency and fairness, 20 judges were appointed as returning officers for the electoral process.\n\nVoting began at 9am and continued until 4pm with a one-hour break. Despite the high turnout and intense competition, the election process remained peaceful with no untoward incidents reported.\n\nStrict security arrangements were in place throughout the day with law enforcement personnel deployed at the polling venues to maintain order and facilitate smooth conduct of the elections.\n\nThe bar council elections are considered an important indicator of lawyers’ political alignments and often reflect broader trends in national legal politics with the government and opposition-backed groups vying for influence within the legal fraternity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 2nd, 2025",
