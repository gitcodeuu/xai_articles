The trend impacts both the country’s reputation and the lives of those caught in it.\n\nSenior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Kech Captain Zohaib Mohsin told Dawn that the operation was carried out in the outskirts of Turbat, where a Land Cruiser was intercepted with dozens of people on board.\n\n“The arrested persons include 12 men, 13 children and 4 women,” the SSP said. “Two drivers have also been arrested who were allegedly involved in taking these people to Iran through illegal routes.”\n\nSSP Mohsin said initial investigations have revealed that the Afghan nationals were planning to enter Iran via Balochistan and reach Europe.\n\n“All the arrested persons have been handed over to the FIA ​​for further investigation, while a probe has been launched against the network involved in the smuggling”, he said.\n\nThe official added that more arrests were expected after the initial investigation, and the scope of the probe had been expanded.\n\nIn September, the United Nations launched a network on migration in Pakistan in a bid to improve migration governance and tackle human trafficking in the country.\n\nEvery year, many young Pakistanis leave the country via illegal routes in hopes of better employment opportunities. A 2023 study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the European Union found that 24,000 Pakistanis entered EU countries illegally over the past three years.\n\nThe UK has also faced a surge in migrant inflows across the channel, while the USA and Australia have become favoured destinations as well.",
