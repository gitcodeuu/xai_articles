Nearly four months into the current fiscal year, net private-sector credit off-take remains negligible.\n\nBanking experts attribute this stagnation to two key factors: banks’ preference for investing in high-yield government securities, which offer assured returns, and the private sector’s reluctance to borrow amid elevated  interest rates and uncertain economic policies that continue to restrain  growth.\n\nThe sector’s net interest income (NII) improved by 6pc  YoY but remained largely flat QoQ. The YoY rise was driven mainly by  the United Bank Ltd, whose NII surged 78pc to Rs92bn, followed by  the National Bank of Pakistan with 74pc growth to Rs61bn, and the Bank of  Punjab with a 61pc increase to Rs23bn.\n\nHigh yields on govt papers lift earnings\n\nExcluding these three  banks, the overall NII of the sector declined 10pc YoY. On a QoQ basis,  most banks saw little change as gains in a few institutions were offset  by declines in others. Some banks achieved modest QoQ growth due to  higher business volumes and a favourable shift in deposit mix towards  current accounts.\n\nNon-interest income rose 13pc YoY and 1pc QoQ to  Rs146bn in 3Q2025, supported by capital gains, fee income and stronger  foreign-exchange revenues. Non-interest expenses, however, climbed 19pc  YoY and 5pc QoQ to Rs329bn, largely due to higher remittance-related  costs. Consequently, the sector’s cost-to-income ratio rose to 47.9pc in  3Q2025 from 45.9pc in the previous quarter and 43.3pc a year earlier.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 2nd, 2025",
