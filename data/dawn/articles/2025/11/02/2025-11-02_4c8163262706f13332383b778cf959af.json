Pakistan will evaluate it with a view to facilitating responsible investment and ensuring mutual benefit,” the minister said.\n\nMr Aurangzeb also positioned Pakistan as navigating a complex geopolitical landscape, highlighting its strengthened partnerships. “Pakistan today stands at a constructive intersection of global relationships—renewed momentum in Pakistan-US ties, time-tested relations with China, and forward-looking strategic cooperation with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,” he said.\n\nHe stressed that Pakistan’s mineral sector represents a “transformational opportunity” that could shift the country from “consumption-driven cycles to export-led growth.”\n\nHe added, “A strong minerals policy framework will help Pakistan break the cycle of periodic balance-of-payments pressures and reduce future reliance on multilateral support.”\n\nThe minister also updated the delegation that during his recent visit to Washington he met multiple global financial institutions, including Development Finance Corporation (DFC) and International Finance Corporation (IFC), which expressed interest in expanding investments in Pakistan.\n\nUS stakeholders are concerned about China’s growing control over global critical minerals. The CMF president noted Chinese dominance stems from government subsidies, vertical integration, and lax regulations, especially in processing, which is energy and compliance-dependent, contrasting with US under-investment.\n\nAccording to the influential US Atlantic Council, critical minerals are foundational to the modern economy and state power, essential for advanced technologies in energy, military, and commercial applications. They range from permanent magnets in fighter jets to batteries in electric vehicles.\n\nThe Atlantic Council warned that these “supply chains have become increasingly brittle: concentrated in a handful of countries, overwhelmingly refined in China, and increasingly exposed to extreme weather disruption.” It noted that China has shown a “willingness to weaponise its dominance”, tightening export restrictions on materials like graphite and antimony in retaliation for US trade controls.\n\nHowever, a major obstacle to US investment remains, Strayer said, citing the “unusually high uncertainty of both production costs and mineral prices”.\n\nHe added that this uncertainty has “a chilling effect on new investment by profit-seeking companies, as investors prefer to make investments in projects with higher risk-adjusted expected profits.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",
