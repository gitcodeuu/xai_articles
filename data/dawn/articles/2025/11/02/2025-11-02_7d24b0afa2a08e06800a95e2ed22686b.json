The events paid tribute to the heroes of the 1947 liberation from the Kashmiri Dogra rulers, after which the independent state chose to join Pakistan.\n\n“This region is not only the crown of Pakistan but also our northern gateway and a symbol of our lasting friendship with China,” President Zardari said in his address.\n\nHe pointed to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a source of major new opportunities for the region.\n\n“The CPEC has brought new opportunities for livelihood, trade and connectivity to GB. Our collective task is to ensure that these opportunities reach every valley and every village, creating shared prosperity for all.”\n\nThe president emphasised GB’s vast natural resources, particularly its potential for hydropower generation and tourism. He suggested a unique initiative to boost the local economy, proposing that the region could have its own airline.\n\n“I was thinking that the kind of plane in which I came here — it is not very expensive. So if GB gets its own airline, then what’s the harm in that?” he asked, adding that his party’s efforts were focused on promoting the region’s progress.\n\nHighlighting the historic contributions of his PPP, President Zardari noted that former leaders Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto introduced key governan­ce and administrative reforms in the region.\n\nIn his speech, GB Chief Minister Haji Gulbar Khan thanked the president for his participation and underscored the region’s strategic importance. “GB people without foreign support were liberated from Dogra Raj and annexed with Pakistan unconditionally on the basis of religion,” he said.\n\nCM Khan also noted the long-standing desire of the Kashmiris to become a fully constitutional part of the country, arguing it would end their long-standing demand and “foil the conspiracies of India”. Ear­lier, the day began with a flag-hoisting ceremony at the historic Chinar Bagh, where Governor Syed Mehdi Shah and CM Khan laid a wreath at the martyrs’ memorial.\n\nIn his address, Governor Shah said, “1st November is a historical day of our freedom, sacrifice and self-determination, which gave us our identity.”\n\nThe main ceremony included a military parade and cultural floats representing all three divisions of GB.\n\nIt was attended by Governor Shah, CM  Khan, Corps Commander Lt Gen Ahsan Amir Nawaz, civil and military officials, and a large number of citizens from all walks of life.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 2nd, 2025",
