But trends diverged by region. Inflows rose 12pc in Latin America and the Caribbean and 7pc in developing countries in Asia, but fell 42pc in Africa.\n\nHigh borrowing costs and economic uncertainty continued to squeeze investment in industry and infrastructure in the first half of 2025.\n\nAnnouncements of gre­en­field projects — when firms build new operations abroad — fell 17pc in number, driven by a 29pc decline in supply-chain-intensive manufacturing such as textiles, electronics and automotive, amid tariff uncertainty.\n\nInternational project fin­ance — critical for infrastructure development — also declined, with deal numbers down 11pc and value 8pc.\n\nThe trend was more positive in developing economies, where project finance deals fell only 2pc after two years of sharp declines.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 2nd, 2025",
