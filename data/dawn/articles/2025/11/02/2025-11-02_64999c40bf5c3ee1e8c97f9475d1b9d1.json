The opposition also favoured the early convening of a multi-party conference on peace.\n\nOn Oct 26, leadership of the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf held a meeting and decided to convene a “peace jirga” in the house.\n\nThe participants, including PTI chairman Barrister Gohar, Chief Minister Sohail Afridi, Speaker of the KP Assembly Babar Saleem Swati, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar, former speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser and other senior party leaders, decided that the jirga would bring together former chief ministers, governors, religious scholars, tribal elders, members of civil society, lawyers and other prominent figures from the province.\n\nIn a tweet, PTI provincial president Junaid Akbar confirmed the convening of the jirga and said the party’s government would seek guidance from participants for peace and security in the province and the future course of action.\n\n“We, the Pakhtuns, must rise above politics and party lines, sit together and find solutions to our problems,” he noted.\n\nAn official statement later issued read that the peace jirga’s objective was to formulate a joint strategy for the eradication of terrorism and the establishment of sustainable peace in the province.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 2nd, 2025",
