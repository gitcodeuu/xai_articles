This is a moment where a loud anti-Trump voice in America’s biggest city is going to get news,” Lincoln Mitchell, a politics professor at Columbia University, told AFP. “Frankly, a Muslim candidate for mayor of New York is an enormous story.”\n\nMamdani, 34, has attacked his opponents for Islamophobic rhetoric and smears, calling out both Republicans and Democrats for “anti-Muslim sentiment that has grown so endemic in our city”.\n\nNew York City Board of Elections data showed 275,006 registered Democrats had cast ballots, as had 46,115 Republicans, along with 42,383 voters unaffiliated with any party in the first five days of early voting, which ends on November 2.\n\nMamdani’s ascent has highlighted the gulf between the left and centre-right of the Democratic Party. New York’s state governor, centrist Kathy Hochul, appeared at a Mamdani rally on October 26 but was drowned out by “tax the rich” chants, an AFP correspondent saw.\n\nHochul has been critical of Mamdani’s proposals to impose a 2pc income tax on New Yorkers making more than $1 million.\n\nMamdani’s unlikely ascent has been fueled by young New Yorkers canvassing for him, with his campaign claiming 90,000 people have volunteered.\n\n“It really comes back to people speaking to other New Yorkers about the city that we all love,” Mamdani told ‘The Daily Show’.\n\nTeenager Abid Mahdi, a Queens native who leads canvases for Mamdani, told AFP that “when I think of Zohran, I think of what Bernie Sanders was to many Americans in 2016 and 2020. He is my Bernie Sanders in a lot of ways.”\n\nMamdani appeared with leftist standard-bearer Senator Bernie Sanders at a Queens rally on October 26.\n\n“I’m 15 right now, I’ll be an adult and paying taxes at 18, right? The majority of laws will apply to me in about three years. So, why should I start caring then?” added Mahdi.\n\nUnderscoring the importance of older voters who typically turn out in greater numbers than youngsters, Mamdani attended a “paint and pour” session at an elder care home in Brooklyn on Thursday.\n\nTorrential rain at the end of the week slowed canvassing, with the three leading candidates touring TV studios in a final push to woo wavering voters.\n\nAhead of the vote, Sliwa appeared in a surreal conservative rap video wearing a suit and his signature red beret.\n\nCuomo, 67, sought on Thursday to court Black and Muslim voters, campaigning in Harlem with current mayor Eric Adams, a corruption-accused Democrat who bowed out, eventually endorsing his former foe Cuomo.\n\nThere was a stir in the week when a British newspaper published what claimed to be an interview with former mayor and Mamdani backer Bill de Blasio in which he appeared to question the affordability of the Democratic socialist’s spending plans. The article was removed after the former mayor denied speaking to the journalist.\n\nA day prior, former Democrat president Barack Obama called Mamdani and offered to be a sounding board if the frontrunner wins the election. He also praised Mamdani’s campaign.\n\nThe call, first reported by The New York Times, was confirmed by Mamdani’s spokesperson.\n\n“Zohran Mamdani appreciated President Obama’s words of support and their conversation on the importance of bringing a new kind of politics to our city, said Mamdani spokesperson Dora Pekec.\n\nAdditional input from Reuters",
