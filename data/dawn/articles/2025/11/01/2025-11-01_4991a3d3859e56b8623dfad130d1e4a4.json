The inquiry drew condemnation from right-wing politicians and prompted protesters to storm two military compounds after investigators sought troops for questioning in the case.\n\nA week after the break-in at the bases, a security camera video showing the moments of the alleged abuse was leaked to an Israeli television channel.\n\nIt showed soldiers taking a prisoner aside and crowding around while holding a dog and blocking visibility of their actions with their riot gear.\n\nOn Wednesday, Defence Minister Israel Katz said that there has been an ongoing criminal inquiry into the video leak and that Tomer-Yerushalmi was on forced leave.\n\nTomer-Yerushalmi defended her action as an attempt to fend off propaganda against the military’s legal department entrusted with upholding the rule of law, and which she said had been subjected to smears throughout the war.\n\n‘Violence must be probed’\n\nThe footage came from Sde Teiman detention camp, where some Hamas fighters are held.\n\nRights groups have reported grave abuses of Palestinians in Israeli detention since Oct 2023. Israel’s military is investigating dozens of cases, but says abuse is not systematic.\n\nTomer-Yerushalmi called Sde Teiman detainees  “terrorists of the worst kind”, in her resignation letter, but added that this did not take away from the obligation to investigate suspected abuse.\n\n“To my regret, this basic understanding — that there are acts to which even the most vile of detainees must not be subjected — is no longer convincing to all,” she said.\n\nSome politicians were swift to seize on Tomer-Yerushalmi’s resignation. Katz said that anyone who fabricates “blood libels against Israeli soldiers was unworthy of donning IDF uniform”.\n\nPolice Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir welcomed the resignation and called for an inquiry into more legal authorities.\n\nHe also posted a video of himself standing over Palestinian prisoners who were lying bound on the floor in an Israeli jail, saying that they were Oct 7 attackers who should receive the death penalty.\n\nAround 1,700 Gaza detainees were freed this month as part of the ceasefire in exchange for 20 Israeli prisoners.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",
