In parallel, the Offshore Petroleum Rules were promulgated to provide a comprehensive regulatory framework, paving the way for renewed offshore exploration in Pakistan’s waters.\n\nA recent basin study conducted by the US firm DeGolyer and MacNaughton (D&M) has indicated a significant yet-to-find potential of hydrocarbons in Pakistan’s offshore basins. Building on this encouraging assessment, the Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched to offer blocks that enable companies to undertake systematic exploration to test various geological plays across both the Indus and Makran basins.\n\nThe statement said the bids were publicly opened transparently on October 31 by the Bid Opening Committee, chaired by the Director General Petroleum Concessions (DGPC), in the presence of representatives from the provincial governments of Sindh and Balochistan, the two coastal provinces hosting the offshore areas. The Offshore Bid Round 2025 was launched in January this year, after a 18-year gap, to grant petroleum exploration licenses for 40 offshore blocks.\n\nThe petroleum division said a total of 4,427 work units have been committed for these 23 blocks during Phase 1 of the initial three-year license period, representing an investment of approximately $80 million.\n\nThe companies have submitted work programmes designed to progressively mitigate geological risks, and, in the event of exploration drilling, investments could reach $750m to $1bn, it said.\n\nDuring Phase 1, the companies will undertake comprehensive geophysical and geological (G&G) studies, including seismic data acquisition, processing, and interpretation, to better define the hydrocarbon potential of Pakistan’s offshore basins. Upon completion of these studies, the Phase-II work programme will be finalised, including the drilling of exploratory wells in the prospective areas.\n\nThe statement said the government strategy to initiate exploration in both the Indus and Makran basins simultaneously paid off, as reflected in the participation and outcome of the bid round. After the completion of G&G work and drilling planning, the Ministry will invite global oil majors to join the next phase of offshore exploration, several of whom are already in contact with the government and local companies and are currently evaluating the available data.\n\nThe statement said a major intervention came from TPAO, a national company of Türkiye, which has taken a 25pc stake in the offshore block-C, along with operatorship.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",
