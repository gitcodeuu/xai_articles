It said that the streets and major roads in the city, either under the administrative control of the KMC or towns, were in dilapidated conditions and there were no traffic signs or directions for speed limits and other traffic rules.\n\nThe City Council members through the resolution demanded of the provincial government to immediately withdraw the notification of the enhanced traffic-violation fines.\n\nThe resolution demanded that the e-challans be issued only as warning to the traffic laws violators. It also demanded that traffic police be deputed to regulate traffic and train road users instead of harassing them.\n\nThe resolution said that the streets and roads be repaired so people were not compelled to adopt an otherwise wrong way. It also demanded that the cameras installed in the city be used to contain crime.\n\nRejecting the provincial government’s decision, PTI’s Saad Khan jibed that the roads in the city were “like in Afghanistan”, while the challans were “like in Azerbaijan”.\n\nJI member Junaid Mukati asked why Karachi was singled out for the implementation of e-challan system.\n\nHe also asked as to why no action was taken against dumper mafia, claiming that the provincial authorities were involved in the menace.\n\nJustifying the government decision, PPP member Najmi Alam said that the results of the new e-challan system were now visible at least on Sharea Faisal as people had started abiding by the traffic laws.\n\nWhile the debate on the resolution against the e-challan was still continuing with an opposition member speaking on it, the deputy mayor adjourned the session to a date to be announced later.\n\nPublic projects named after PPP leaders\n\nA resolution passed by a majority vote allowed the KMC to name the Karimabad underpass after PPP leader Dr Asim Hussain in recognition of “his personal interest and efforts in the project”.\n\nIt also asked KMC to invite Dr Asim Hussain or his representative to the inauguration ceremony to publicly acknowledge his contributions.\n\nSimilarly, the overhead bridge on Khalid Bin Waleed Road was approved to be named after the late Muhammad Umar Jat, former PPP District Malir President and former Nazim of Bin Qasim Town.\n\nOther resolutions included approval of the improvement/restoration plan for Jehangir Road, the rehabilitation of the storm-water drain from Gurumandir to Teen Hatti, the construction of the Natha Khan Bridge Grade & Link Road from Sharea Faisal to Habib University, land utilisation plans for Khaleelabad and Bilalabad, the upgradation of posts of Chief Fire Officer, Team Leader/Commander, and Deputy Chief Fire Officer in the KMC Fire Brigade and USAR Department, and recommendations for upgrading operational staff positions in the Fire Brigade Department.\n\nEarlier, the council approved 20 resolutions, eight of them unanimously.\n\nAt the outset of the proceeding, a condolence resolution was unanimously adopted to condole the demise of former Speaker of Sindh Assembly Agha Siraj Durrani.\n\nAnother resolution, passed unanimously, strongly condemned India’s illegal occupation of Kashmir and expressed solidarity with the Kashmiri people.\n\nAmong other resolutions passed by a majority vote, the Council approved recommendations related to KMC’s Department of State and Accommodation by-laws.\n\nThe council also approved naming the underpass at Golimar Chowrangi after the late Qadir Bakhsh Bakkak in recognition of his valuable services to local governance, naming the Lyari Family Park after the slain PPP leader Waja Kareem Dad, and launching a citywide tree plantation campaign in all roads, parks, schools, hospitals, and recreational areas to control environmental pollution.\n\nThrough a unanimously approved resolution, the Council granted approval for establishing a bus depot named “KMC General Bus Stand” on Plot No. 108, Sheet No. K-28, Manghopir Road (Gutter Baghicha) and entrusted its operation, maintenance, and upkeep for 10 years to “The Silk Route Transport Company”.\n\nAnother unanimously passed resolution approved granting Plot No. ST-13, Sector 15/16 (Gulistan-i-Mazdoor) to The Citizens Foundation on an annual lease for the construction and operation of a primary and secondary school for purely educational purposes.\n\nAnother unanimously passed resolution called upon the government to bring Kiran Hospital Road and Suparco Road under the administrative control of the KMC to address public complaints arising due to the Red Line project on University Road and to ensure proper maintenance of these roads.\n\nIt was also agreed to name Kiran Hospital Road after Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan, the benefactor of Pakistan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",
