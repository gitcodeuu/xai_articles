  "content": "ISLAMABAD: Short-term inflation, measured by the Sensitive Price Index (SPI), increased 5.05 per cent year-on-year in the week ending Oct 30, owing to an increase in the retail price of perishable food products in the domestic market.\n\nThe SPI-based inflation recorded an upward trend for the past 13 consecutive weeks. The increase is mainly driven by a surge in prices of perishable products, including onions, tomatoes, potatoes, wheat flour as well as edible oil.\n\nIt, however, rose 0.12pc from the previous week, data showed on Friday.\n\nThe prices of tomatoes, onions and potatoes saw an increase owing to disruption in supply due to closure of the border with Afghanistan.
