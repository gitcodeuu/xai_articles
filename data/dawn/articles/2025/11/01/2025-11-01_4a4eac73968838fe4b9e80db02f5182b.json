It was added that on May 28, 2018, the former district nazim of Mardan Himayatullah Mayar, had filed a complaint alleging that the petitioner had illegally transferred 500 kanal agricultural ‘government land;’ in the name of his father and subsequently a private housing society was constructed through government funds.\n\n“The record reveals that the complaint forming the basis of the impugned inquiry was lodged in 2018, while the inquiry No. 8l pertains to year, 2014, but no preliminary or open inquiry was initiated by the Anti-Corruption Establishment (ACE) for almost seven years. The Establishment remained dormant throughout this prolonged period, and only in 2025, after a considerable lapse of time, an inquiry was commenced on the very same complaint containing no fresh allegations or additional material,” the bench observed.\n\n“Though, the Rule provides limited discretion to the competent authority to extend the time for reasonable grounds, yet there is no provision permitting revival of a stale complaint after several years of inaction,” the bench observed.\n\nThe court further ruled: “Thus, the initiation of an inquiry after seven years not only defeats the object of Rule 6 (KP ACE Rules 1999), which was designed to ensure prompt and fair investigations and to prevent misuse of administrative machinery for belated or extraneous purposes but also renders the action of Anti-Corruption Establishment highly suspicious; such conduct smacks of mala fide and cannot withstand judicial scrutiny.”\n\nThe court further pointed out “In the circumstances initiation of the present inquiry after a lapse of seven years on an old complaint without the discovery of any new material or authorisation under Rule 3, and that too without specific information of the inquiry, amounts to an arbitrary, mala fide, and unlawful exercise of jurisdiction. Such action is inconsistent with Rule 6 of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Anti-Corruption Establishment Rules, 1999, and violative of constitutional guarantees of due process and fair treatment.”\n\n“It is settled law that ordinarily the superior Courts do not interfere in matters during the investigation phase, as the same falls within the exclusive domain of the investigating agency. However, when mala fide is apparent on the face of record or the action is without lawful authority, the courts cannot remain silent spectators,” it declared.\n\nThe bench also referred to multiple judgements of the superior courts on the matter.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 1st, 2025",
