All finals of Masters 1000s are a dream, but (especially) in Paris, a tournament with so much history and important past champions,” said Auger-Aliassime.\n\nAuger-Aliassime climbs above Lorenzo Musetti into the eighth and last qualifying spot for the ATP Finals in Turin later this month.\n\nThe 25-year-old can seal his second appearance in the season-ending tournament with victory in Sunday’s showpiece match.\n\nAuger-Aliassime fell just short of a Masters title at the 2024 Madrid Open against Andrey Rublev.\n\nBublik, who made the French Open quarter-finals in Paris earlier this year, can no longer reach the Finals despite an excellent year in which he has won four ATP titles.\n\nA tight first set flew by without a single break-point opportunity, before two weak forehands into the net from Bublik allowed a rock-solid Auger-Aliassime to win the tie-break.\n\nThe match burst into life early in the second when Bublik seized a 2-0 lead only to give the break straight back.\n\nHe reacted by smashing his racquet, repeatedly, against the court, earning himself a code violation.\n\nAuger-Aliassime swept up some of the racquet remnants with a towel ahead of the next game, to the gratitude of his opponent.\n\nThe Canadian presented Bublik with another gift, firing a simple volley well wide as he slipped 3-1 behind.\n\nWorld number 16 Bublik could not maintain his momentum.\n\nAuger-Aliassime reeled off five successive games against an increasingly forlorn Bublik, taking his first match point with a thumping cross-court forehand.",
