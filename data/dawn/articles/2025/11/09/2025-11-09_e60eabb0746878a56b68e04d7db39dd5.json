In contrast, the deficit had widened 7.37pc to $13.974bn in FY25, compared to $13.014bn a year earlier.\n\nImports from the Middle East dropped 5.48pc to $4.274bn in the first quarter, from $4.522bn in the corresponding months of last year. The decline largely reflected lower oil imports, particularly from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), as Pakistan began sourcing crude from the United States under a new energy arrangement.\n\nExports to the region fell 12.19pc to $715.63m, compared to $815.04m a year earlier. In FY25, exports had slipped 1.52pc to $3.107bn, while imports rose 5.64pc to $17.081bn, widening the annual trade gap.\n\nOil purchases from GCC ease as Pakistan diversifies energy sources\n\nIslamabad recently signed a free trade agreement (FTA) with the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), aimed at improving market access for Pakistani products and addressing the persistent imbalance in regional trade.\n\nCountry-wise performance\n\nExports to Saudi Arabia fell 8.94pc to $160.24m in July–September FY26, from $175.99m in the same period last year, while imports from the kingdom dropped 16.99pc to $884.01m, from $1.065bn.\n\nTrade with the UAE showed mixed trends. Exports declined 12.95pc to $491.58m, from $564.72m, while imports rose 7.61pc to $2.163bn, from $2.010bn. Pakistan’s main exports to the UAE include rice, bovine meat, cotton garments, guavas and mangoes.\n\nExports to Bahrain fell to $12.79m from $14.63m, while imports surged to $76.02m from $19.09m. Exports to Qatar declined to $23.63m from $33.18m, while imports dropped 12.21pc to $781.34m, from $890.07m. Exports to Kuwait edged up to $27.39m from $26.52m, but imports decreased to $369.84m, from $538.03m.\n\nOfficials say that while the quarterly data indicate a modest improvement, the overall trade balance with the Middle East remains heavily influenced by petroleum imports. Further progress will depend on Pakistan’s ability to expand exports beyond traditional products and markets.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
