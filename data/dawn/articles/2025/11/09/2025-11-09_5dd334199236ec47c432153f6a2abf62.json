I have instructed that it be withdrawn immediately,” PM Shehbaz wrote.\n\n“As a matter of principle, an elected prime minister must remain fully accountable, both before the court of law and the people.”\n\nSeparately, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar, while speaking to reporters today, said that PM Shehbaz told him earlier that “he had no interest in getting immunity,” owing to the executive nature of his role as the prime minister.\n\n“The other positions being granted immunity do not have any executive functions,” Tarrar explained.\n\nThe statement comes as Senate and National Assembly committees continue to hold discussions on the proposed bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment.\n\nThe bill proposes the creation of a Federal Constitutional Court (FCC), changes to the appointment process for high court judges, a higher cap on provincial cabinets, and changes to the military leadership structure. A set of clauses in the bill also proposes life-long constitutional protection to officers promoted to five-star ranks of field marshal, marshal of the air force or admiral of the fleet.\n\nSuch officers would “retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life”, removable only through the impeachment-like procedure under Article 47.\n\nImmunities similar to those enjoyed by the president under Article 248 would apply in this case.\n\nArticle 248 of the Constitution stipulates that “no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be instituted or continued against the president or a governor in any court during his term of office.”\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, the federal cabinet approved the bill for the 27th Constitutional Amendment, welcoming it to “the fullest extent.”\n\nSubsequently, it was tabled before the Senate, triggering noisy protests from the opposition over the pace and scope of the proposed changes.\n\nPM Shehbaz was elected as the 24th premier of Pakistan in the 2024 general elections. Article 95 of the Constitution of Pakistan allows for a prime minister to be impeached via a no-confidence motion.\n\nIt states: “A resolution for a vote of no-confidence moved by not less than twenty per centum of the total membership of the National Assembly may be passed against the Prime Minister by the National Assembly.”",
