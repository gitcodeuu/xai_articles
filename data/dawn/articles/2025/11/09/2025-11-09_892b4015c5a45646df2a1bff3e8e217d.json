The Election Commission of Pakistan rescheduled the ballot to Nov 23.\n\nSources in RO office said 30 aspirants had filed their papers, including ex-MPA Bilal Farooq Tarrar of the PML N, ex-MPA Ijaz Samman of the PPP, four family members of veteran politician Hamid Nasir Chattha and others.\n\nHowever, all four members of the Chattha family, including Ahmed Chattha, his wife Ain Chattha, brother Fayyaz Chattha, also a former Gujranwala district nazim, and his daughter, had withdrawn their nomination papers after PTI founder Imran Khan announced boycott of the by-polls in Punjab.\n\nPPP’s Ijaz Samman too withdrew his papers as per the seat adjustment formula of his party with the PML- N whereas some other independent candidates also quit the race.\n\nTwo candidates backed by Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) and some others submitted their retirement, paving the way for Bilal Tarrar’s return unopposed.\n\nThe notification has been sent to the ECP for the issuance of a formal notification of the returned candidate.\n\nBelonging to Pir Kot village near Gakhar Mandi town of Gujranwala, Bilal Tarrar had earlier been elected as an MPA twice from a Punjab Assembly seat of Rahwali and Gakhar towns but he lost the February 2024 polls on that PA seat.\n\nBilal Tarrar is the grandson of former president Rafique Tarrar and this is for the first time that the Tarrar family contested an NA seat of Wazirabad as earlier in February 2024 polls, Attaullah Tarrar applied for the PML-N ticket from a Gujranwala NA seat which was resisted by senior parliamentarian and former federal minister Mahmood Basheer Virk as the latter succeeded in keeping the senior Tarrar away.\n\nMeanwhile, Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz has congratulated the unopposed election.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
