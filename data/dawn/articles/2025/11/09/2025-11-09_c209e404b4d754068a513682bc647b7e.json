Even the Lahore High Court took up these issues very seriously, directing the government to take action by introducing various interventions in this regard,” an official source in the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) told Dawn on Saturday.\n\nFor this, according to him, the city’s busiest areas had been divided into various zones, starting from revamping areas around the Data Darbar, Bhati Chowk, Mohni Road and surroundings.\n\nThe project, worth Rs2.5 billion, include remodeling Bhati Chowk, development of a sitting area in front of Data Darbar, development of pedestrian zones, a pedestrian bridge connecting the sitting area with the parking, a parking facility, widening of road from Lower Mall to Bhati Chowk and Mohni Road, uplifting of façade of adjoining areas of Data Darbar, landscaping, restoration of street lights, road furniture and signage etc.\n\nAccording to a document, around 5.5 kanal private land is being acquired, whereas the 16 kanal state land under use of the recently-demolished bird market has also been taken into possession. The project aims to provide smooth traffic flow to around 270,000 vehicles per day.\n\nThe major benefits, according to officials, include uninterrupted traffic flow, safe pedestrian mobility, aesthetic improvement of the area and reduction in smog and carbon emission. The project includes the localities of Data Darbar and surrounding roads, Bhati Chowk, Lower Mall, Circular Road (Bhati to Azadi interchange) and Mohni Road. The LDA will fund this project from its own sources, whereas its subsidiary — Tepa will execute this scheme within eight months.\n\nOfficials say busiest areas have been divided into various zones for the project starting from revamping Data Darbar, Bhati Chowk, Mohni Road and surroundings\n\n“The other areas set to be remodeled on the pattern of the aforementioned scheme include the area in front of the railway station, Misri Shah, Aik Moria Pul, Do Moria Pul and Circular Road,” revealed another official while talking to this scribe. He said the completion of these development schemes would help control the pollution and improve the environment in the city significantly.\n\nTo a question, he said the debris of the demolished bird market near the Darbar had been removed completely. “This work was completed on Saturday,” he added.\n\nDATABASE DIGITISATION: The Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) has initiated computerisation of the database of all billboards and hoardings displayed across the city for advertising purposes.\n\nThis initiative is being carried out to replace the traditional billing and revenue recovery system with a fully automated, transparent process. According to PHA Additional Director General Zeeshan Nasrullah Ranjha, the digitalisation was part of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz’s vision to ensure transparency in billing and revenue recovery and eliminating corruption.\n\nHe added that PHA was committed to enhancing the beauty and greenery of the provincial capital. Increasing PHA’s revenue and ensuring its financial self-sufficiency were the top priorities of the government of Punjab, he added.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
