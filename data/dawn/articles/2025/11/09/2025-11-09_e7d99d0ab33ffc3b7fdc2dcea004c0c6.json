The defence minister also said that the truce stands for the time being but warned that the “moment there is a ceasefire violation from their side, we will respond befittingly”.\n\nThe third round of Pakistan-Afghanistan talks began on Thursday in Istanbul and was planned to continue for two days. Pakistan’s delegation, led by Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Director General Lt Gen Asim Malik, included senior military, intelligence and Foreign Office officials.\n\nThe Afghan Taliban side was headed by General Directorate of Intelligence (GDI) chief Abdul Haq Waseq and included Suhail Shaheen, Anas Haqqani and Deputy Interior Minister Rehmatullah Najib.\n\nReports from Istanbul suggest that the Pakistani delegation had left the hotel for the airport after the talks broke down. There was no direct meeting between the two delegations on Friday. The sides had met face to face in the presence of Qatari and Turkish mediators the previous day.\n\nThe ISI chief and some members of the Pakistan delegation have left Istanbul, but the Pakistani side is still not ruling out resumption of the process. A source said an attempt will be made to break the deadlock. It is believed that some senior officials have stayed behind to work with the mediators.\n\nFor most of Friday, mediators engaged the Afghan delegation separately, relaying Pakistan’s concerns and demands. Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesman, Tahir Hussain Andrabi, told reporters in Islamabad that the Pakistani delegation had presented its case in a “comprehensive and evidence-based manner”.\n\nHe added, “The Pakistan delegation has handed over its evidence-based, justified and logical demands to the mediators with a singular aim to put an end to cross-border terrorism. They are now discussing Pakistan’s demands with the Afghan delegation point by point.”\n\nThe dialogue process was launched after border clashes in early October that left several soldiers and civilians dead on both sides. Turkiye and Qatar then stepped in to mediate.\n\nThe first round in Doha produced a fragile ceasefire, while the second, also in Doha, ended with only a general agreement to develop a mechanism for verifying compliance and a decision to continue talks.\n\nThe latest round was aimed at finalising the modalities of that verification and monitoring mechanism.\n\nAfghan negotiators, meanwhile, claimed on Friday that their own proposals were “logical and easily achievable” for Pakistan but described Islama­bad’s demands as “unrealistic and aggressive”, suggesting they might serve as a pretext to create further complications.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the discussions, the Afghan side conveyed that “it is up to Pakistan’s own calculations to deal with the situation”.\n\nA source in Istanbul described the late-evening atmosphere at Istanbul’s Conrad Hotel, where the talks were held, as “not positive”.\n\nMeanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi on Sunday spoke to his Pakistani and Afghan counterparts, Ishaq Dar and Amir Khan Muttaqi, discussing bilateral ties as well as the recent negotiations in Istanbul between Islamabad and Kabul, the Iranian and Afghan foreign ministries said.\n\nAccording to Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency, Araghchi announced Iran’s readiness for any kind of assistance to resolve differences between the two countries.\n\n“Expressing concern about the current situation between Afghanistan and Pakistan, he emphasised the need for continued dialogue between the two sides with the cooperation of influential countries in the region to resolve differences and reduce tension, and announced the readiness of the Islamic Republic of Iran to provide any kind of assistance to achieve this goal.\n\nFM Dar, while explaining the latest situation and the results of the talks between his country and Afghanistan following recent developments, stressed the importance of maintaining peace and stability in the region, according to IRNA. The two sides also agreed to continue consultations in this regard.",
