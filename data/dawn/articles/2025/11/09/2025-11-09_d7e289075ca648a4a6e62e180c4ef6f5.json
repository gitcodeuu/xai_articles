  "content": "DUBLIN: Members of Irish football’s governing body voted overwhelmingly on Saturday for its board to request that UEFA immediately suspend Israel from European competitions, the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) said.\n\nA resolution passed by the FAI members cited alleged violations by Israel’s Football Association of two provisions of UEFA statutes: its failure to implement and enforce an effective anti-racism policy and the playing by Israeli clubs in occupied Palestinian territories without the consent of the Palestinian Football Association.\n\nThe resolution was backed by 74 votes, with seven opposed and two abstentions, the FAI said in a statement.Advertisements\n\n\n\n            Video Player is loading.Play VideoPlayLoaded: 1.66%00:00Remaining Time -10:03MuteFullscreenThis is a modal window.Beginning of dialog window.

That did not happen after a US-brokered ceasefire took effect on Oct 10.\n\nThe Irish resolution follows calls in September from the heads of the Turkish and Norwegian soccer governing bodies for Israel to be suspended from international competition.\n\nThose requests came after United Nations experts appealed to FIFA and UEFA to suspend Israel from international football, citing a UN Commission of Inquiry report that said Israel had committed genocide during the war in Gaza.\n\nIsrael has denied committing genocide and described the report as scandalous.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
