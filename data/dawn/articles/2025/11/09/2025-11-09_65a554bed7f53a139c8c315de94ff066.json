The decision follows similar cooperation by the Federation of Pakistan Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI).\n\nDuring a meeting at KCCI on Saturday, KCCI President Rehan Hanif and LCCI President Faheem ur Rehman Saigol highlighted that inconsistent policies and neglect of the private sector could further weaken the economy.\n\nMr Saigol said Pakistan’s economy survives due to its natural and human resources, but mismanagement undermines its potential. “KCCI and LCCI are aligned in seeking a rightful role in policymaking. Legislation should be developed in consultation with the business community, which understands how tax collection can be more effective,” he added, stressing the need for a unified business voice.\n\nVice Chairman of the Businessmen Group (BMG), Anjum Nisar, said coordinated efforts by KCCI and LCCI, which represent over 90pc of Pakistan’s economic activity, would carry significant weight and push the government to address critical concerns, including shortages and rising costs of water, gas, and electricity.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
