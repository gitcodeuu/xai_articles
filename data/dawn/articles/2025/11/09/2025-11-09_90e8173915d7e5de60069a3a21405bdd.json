But a White House official said Hungary’s exemption was only for one year.\n\nHungary had committed to purchasing US liquefied natural gas worth around $600 million, the official said.\n\nThe Hungarian prime minister has maintained close ties with both Moscow and Washington, while often bucking the rest of the EU on pressuring Russia over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nOrban offered to host a summit in Budapest between Trump and Putin, although the US leader called it off last month and hit Moscow with sanctions for the first time in his presidency.\n\nAt the White House, Orban pressed his case that Russian energy was vital for Hungary. “Pipeline is not an ideological or political issue. It’s a physical reality because we don’t have ports,” Orban said.\n\nWashington has given firms who work with Russian oil giants Rosneft and Lukoil one month to cut ties or face secondary sanctions, which would deny them access to US banks, traders, shippers and insurers.\n\nOrban also said it would take a “miracle” for Ukraine to beat Moscow, underscoring the gulf between him and other European leaders on the war.\n\nTrump wholeheartedly backed Orban on the touchstone issue of migration, saying that the Hungary’s European Union counterparts should show him more respect.\n\nOrban has long thumbed his nose at the EU over migration. He has also refused to send military aid to Ukraine and opposes Kyiv’s EU bid, and has had frequent run-ins with Brussels on the rule of law and other issues.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
