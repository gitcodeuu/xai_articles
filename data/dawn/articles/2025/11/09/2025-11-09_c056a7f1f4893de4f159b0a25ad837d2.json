Now, with clear signals that a 27th amendment is being pushed forward, it seems the 18th Amendment may finally end up on the chopping block.\n\nPPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari, revealing that the prime minister has sought his party’s support for the amendment, has stated that the subjects of education and population planning have been sought to be returned to the federation. This would mean a significant rollback of the powers delegated to the provinces under the 18th Amendment.\n\nNot only that, the safeguards for provincial shares in state revenues under the National Finance Commission Award are also to be done away with. The judiciary is also in the crosshairs, with plans to set up constitutional courts, restore executive magistrates and more tightly control the transfer of judges.\n\nIt is remarkable that the PPP has been approached for its consent. After all, the 18th Amendment was a major achievement for the party and its co-chairman, incumbent President Asif Ali Zardari. The president and his party are being expected to give up the crowning glory of their political contributions in recent memory.\n\nSeen in that context, Mr Bhutto-Zardari’s surprise post on X may have simply been a call for attention. After all, the pressure to get the amendment done must be immense, considering the stakeholders involved. However, it is important that the PPP hold the line. The 18th Amendment may have created new sets of problems, and its lofty ambitions might have failed to materialise, but the legislation was also a shining example of what broad political consensus can achieve. It may be recalled that both the treasury and opposition benches of that time had played central roles in its enactment.\n\nTo see that achievement undone would be no less than a political tragedy. It must also be said that one cannot help but view the 27th amendment with a wary eye, especially after how matters developed following the 26th. In that case, too, it was argued by the ruling parties that the amendment would do much good to the country. The outcomes have been anything but. The fundamental problem remains that the current legislature is wanting in legitimacy and credibility.\n\nIt is no wonder that its repeated attempts to rewrite the Constitution invite deep misgivings and trigger even more discontent, especially among the masses who feel that they have been systematically sidelined by the current regime. The Constitution states that the public will reigns supreme. If there is any deference left for the document, the ruling parties must desist from proceeding on further amendments to the Constitution till public and political consensus can be reached.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 5th, 2025",
