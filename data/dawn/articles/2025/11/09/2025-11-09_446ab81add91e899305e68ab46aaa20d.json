Naek.\n\nDespite a boycott by two members of the Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Senator Kamran Murtaza and MNA Aliya Kamran, the committee continued its proceedings and examined several key constitutional amendments, particularly those pertaining to the superior judiciary.\n\nJUI-F members boycott proceedings; deliberations on field marshal’s status today\n\nThe JUI-F legislators staged a walkout, alleging that provisions previously discarded during the 26th Amendment process were being reintroduced through 27th Amend­m­ent, terming the move a “breach of trust”.\n\nThe committees discussed the composition and functioning of the proposed federal constitutional court.\n\nAccording to informed sources, it was decided during the deliberations that the initial strength of the federal court would be determined through a presidential order.\n\nHowever, they said, any subsequent increase in the number of judges would be made through an act of parliament.\n\nThe standing committees in a joint sitting are also likely to finalise the mechanism for the transfer of high court judges through the Judicial Commission of Pakistan (JCP) — a process which may not require the consent of the judges being transferred.\n\nSpeaking to the media after the session, Senator Naek said that the JUI-F members had boycotted the meeting on the directives of their party leadership.\n\n“After their departure, the meeting continued. Around 80 per cent of the proposed amendments have been examined.\n\nThe committee addressed the reservations raised by some members, developed consensus on most points, and resolved ambiguities on several issues,” he said.\n\nField marshal’s status\n\nResponding to a question, he said the committee had not yet discussed Article 243, which would determine the constitutional status of a field marshal, but clarified that the matter would be examined in detail during the clause-by-clause review of the bill.\n\nLaw Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar told rep­orters after the meeting that all parliamentary parties were participating in the process and that the government had also “requested the opposition to contribute constructively”. He described the proposed constitutional package as a “long-awaited and comprehensive reform,” noting that it has been under discussion for more than a decade.\n\n“At the time of the 18th Amendment, this issue was part of the broader constitutional agenda. It resurfaced during the 26th Amendment, but could not materialise due to certain political and procedural considerations,” he recalled.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
