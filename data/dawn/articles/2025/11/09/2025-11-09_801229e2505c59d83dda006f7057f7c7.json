Mr Raja is expected to meet Mr Khan in Adiala jail on Tuesday.\n\nAliya Hamza said the party founder’s focal person was now a final authority and Mr Raja’s tweet is enough to restore previous central Punjab leaders Ahmad Chattha and Bilal Ejaz.\n\n“My notification appointing Ali Imtiaz Warraich and Tariq Mahmood as president and general secretary, respectively, stands null and void,” she said. It may be mentioned that Mr Chattha also lost his NA-66 seat to the PML-N candidate who returned unopposed, as he had withdrawn himself from the election on the instructions of Mr Khan.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
