The lack of political will to ensure sanitation, waste management, and timely and effective fumigation has turned our cities into breeding grounds for the Aedes mosquito. Every death reported is a verdict on the failure of the local government and the provincial health department,” the association stated. It also criticised delayed and ineffective fumigation and what it described as a “collapse of municipal services”.\n\n“Mandate the immediate clearing of stagnant water, open drains, and garbage dumps by local administrations to destroy mosquito breeding sites and enforce environmental health standards,” the association demanded.\n\nOver 200 admitted in Hyderabad hospitals\n\nAccording to the health department data, a total of 429 patients —  including 147 patients in Karachi and 203 in Hyderabad — are currently  under treatment at private and public sector hospitals.\n\nIt said 25 people, including several children, have lost their lives to dengue fever since October.\n\nHealth Secretary Rehan Baloch, however, has claimed that dengue positivity in Hyderabad had declined from 46 per cent last week to 35pc this week.\n\n“The government is closely monitoring the situation,” he stated in a press statement.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
