The ministry said Israeli forces were withholding the boys’ bodies.\n\nThe Israeli military acknowledged the killings, referring to the teenagers as individuals it had “eliminated” — a term frequently employed by Israeli authorities to obscure civilian deaths and dehumanise Palestinians.\n\nAt the same time, in the besieged Strip, Israeli gunfire killed one Palestinian and wounded another near the Bureij refugee camp.\n\nA separate attack in western Khan Younis left another Pales­tinian wounded, medics reported.\n\nThree killed in Lebanon\n\nIn a separate escalation, Israeli strikes on Lebanon killed three people and wounded several others on Saturday.\n\nLebanon’s National News Agency said two brothers from the town of Shebaa were burned alive when an Israeli missile hit their SUV. A separate strike in Baraashit killed one person and wounded four. Another Israeli strike on Saturday morning on a car near a hospital in the southern city of Bint Jbeil wounded seven people, according to the ministry.\n\nThe latest attacks came as the European Union voiced concern. “Focus by all parties must be on preserving the ceasefire and the progress achieved so far.”\n\nSimultaneously, under the cea­­sefire’s prisoner exchange plan, for every one dead Israeli prisoners returned, the bodies of 15 slain Palestinians are handed back by Israel.\n\nOn Saturday, Israel identified the latest prisoner remains sent back from Gaza as those of Lior Rudaeff. Meanwhile, the Nasser Medical Centre in Khan Younis reported receiving the bodies of 15 Pales­tinians.\n\nUS, Israel coordinate aid\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Washington Post, US forces are now involved in coordinating aid through the US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that will replace Israel in overseeing aid into Gaza. It cited a US official and people familiar with the matter as saying Israel was part of the process but that CMCC would decide what aid enters Gaza and how.\n\nHowever, an Israeli security official confirmed that Israel remains part of the supervision and monitoring process, with decisions made jointly. This suggests little change to the stifling Israeli control over what aid enters Gaza.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
