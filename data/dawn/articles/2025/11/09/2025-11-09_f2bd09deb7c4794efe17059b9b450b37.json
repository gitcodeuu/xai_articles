Two people were killed and 12 were wounded in the city of Dnipro when a drone hit an apartment building. One person was killed in the Kharkiv region, regional officials said.\n\nEnergy facilities in the Kyiv, Poltava and Kharkiv regions were damaged, Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko said, adding the government and energy companies were working to restore damaged electricity, water and heating provision.\n\nIn response, Zelensky said sanctions pressure on Moscow should be intensified.\n\n“…for every Moscow strike on energy infrastructure aimed at harming ordinary people before winter there must be a sanctions response targeting all Russian energy, with no exceptions,” he said on the Telegram app.\n\nMoscow’s Defence Ministry said it had launched “a massive strike with high-precision long-range air, ground and sea-based weapons” on weapon production and energy facilities in response to Kyiv’s strikes on Russia. The Ukrainian air force said it shot down 406 Russian drones and nine missiles. It said 26 Russian missiles and 52 drones had hit 25 sites.\n\nRussia captures tiny village\n\nMeanwhile, Russia also said its forces continued to advance in grinding battles around the towns of Pokrovsk and Kupiansk, and had captured a tiny village in eastern Ukraine.\n\nThe Defence Ministry said on Telegram that its forces had taken Vovche, in the southeast corner of the Dnipropetrovsk region.\n\nIn the Donetsk region, Russia said it continued to gain ground in house-by-house fighting in the strategic town of Pokrovsk, as well as nearby Myrnohrad. Russia, which refers to the towns by their Soviet-era names of Krasnoarmeisk and Dmitrov, has said they are both encircled.\n\nThe ministry also said its forces are making progress in Kupiansk, in the Kharkiv region, where it says Ukrainian units are also surrounded.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
