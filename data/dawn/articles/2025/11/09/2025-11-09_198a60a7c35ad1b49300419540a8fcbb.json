  "content": "RAWALPINDI: The strike by nanbais (bakers) in the garrison city entered its fourth consecutive day on Saturday, creating difficulties for residents in obtaining roti from tandoors.\n\nMost tandoors remained closed, though a few opened in some areas.\n\nHowever, the All Pakistan Nanbai Association said the strike would continue until their demands were met.\n\nShafiq Qureshi, President of the All Pakistan Nanbai Association, told Dawn that it was not possible for bakers to sell roti at Rs14 when a sack of wheat flour now costs Rs11,000.\n\n“When this government took over, the same bag was priced at Rs5,500. Similarly, fine flour (maida) that once cost Rs6,200 per sack now sells for Rs12,000,” he said.\n\nTandoors remain closed as association vows to continue protest until demands are met\n\nHe alleged that the Punjab Enforcement Regulatory Authority (Pera) misbehaved with bakers and imposed “unfair” fines ranging from Rs50,000 to Rs100,000. “Sometimes a baker does not have two rupees in change and charges Rs30 for two rotis, but Pera imposes a fine of Rs50,000,” he added.\n\nThe district administration’s invitation for immediate negotiations was rejected by the Nanbai Association, which claimed that such talks were being used as a pretext for arrests. The association stated that during the previous strike, they were also called for talks and then detained.\n\nOn the other hand, Additional Deputy Commissioner General Dr Hassaan Tariq said there were two groups of nanbais in Rawalpindi. He said one group was on strike while the other had opened their tandoors.\n\n“We will ensure all tandoors reopen,” he said, adding that the nanbais’ demands were neither logical nor reasonable and that the district administration would enforce the official roti price of Rs14 at all costs.\n\n“Pera is responsible for enforcing the official rate of roti fixed by the Punjab government and if anyone sells roti or other edibles above the fixed price, strict action will be taken,” he said.\n\nHe added that the wheat supply for tandoors had improved, with fair price shops set up across the district, and that dealers were receiving flour directly from mills at official rates. “Their stance on wheat flour prices is not justified,” he said.\n\nRegarding the gas issue, Dr Tariq said gas pressure was being maintained by Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited as per the schedule issued by the federal government, so this demand was also unreasonable.\n\nDue to the strike, residents faced severe difficulties in purchasing roti and naan.\n\nIshtiaq Ahmed, a resident of Murree Road, said, “The government should resolve this issue immediately through talks so that the burden does not fall on the public.” Another resident, Haider Ali, said, “Tandoor owners sell naan for Rs30 and paratha for Rs50, and after earning so much profit, they still refuse to sell roti at the official price. The government should also fix the price of naan, as most people in urban areas prefer it.”\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
