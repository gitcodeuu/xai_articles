They also agreed to maintain close coordination on regional and international issues of “mutual concern and reiterated their shared desire to promote peace, stability, and prosperity in the region and the broader Muslim world”.\n\nThe prime minister, accompanied by Chief of the Army Staff Field Marshal Asim Munir, also extended warm congratulations to President Erdogan and the brotherly people of Türkiye on the occasion of Türkiye’s Republic Day.\n\nLater, the prime minister departed Baku for Islamabad.\n\nInformation Minister Attaullah Tarar on Saturday said that Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets would appear in Azerbaijan’s Victory Day parade scheduled for later today.\n\nSince 2020, Victory Day has been observed in Azerbaijan on November 8 to commemorate its victory in the 44-day-long Karabakh Liberation War against Armenia.\n\n“Long live Pakistan-Azerbaijan friendship. Pakistani troops and JF-17 Thunder fighter jets will be appearing in Azerbaijan’s victory parade today, commemorating the liberation of Karabagh,” he said.\n\nThe minister made the comments while responding to a post on social media platform X by Pakistan’s embassy in Baku. The embassy had posted about Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who embarked on a visit to the country a day earlier to attend Victory Day celebrations, and Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev attending a joint dinner.\n\nA day earlier, Pakistan and Azerbaijan had reiterated their resolve to further cement their cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence. The two sides made the pledge during a meeting between PM Shehbaz and Azerbaijan President Aliyev in Baku.\n\nChief of the Army Staff (COAS) Field Marshal Asim Munir was also present during the meeting.\n\n“The two leaders reviewed the whole range of bilateral relationship and agreed to further strengthen their multi-layered cooperation in the fields of trade and investments, energy, connectivity and defence,” says a press release issued by the Prime Minister’s Office.\n\nThe prime minister also extended an invitation to the president of Azerbaijan to visit Pakistan at his earliest convenience, which the latter accepted.\n\nIn a late-night post on X, Shehbaz had stated that he was looking forward to the “grand parade”.\n\nTalking about his meeting with President Aliyev, he said the two “reviewed the deep-rooted and fraternal ties between our two countries and agreed to further expand cooperation in trade, energy, connectivity, and defence”.\n\nLast month, a Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent comprising JF-17 Thunder Block-III fighter jets, accompanied by skilled air and ground crew, had landed in Azerbaijan to participate in a bilateral aerial combat exercise.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR), the exercise, called Indus Shield Alpha, aimed to enhance mutual understanding, tactical coordination and interoperability between the air forces of Pakistan and Azerbaijan.",
