However, these benefits cover only two-thirds of the rent, leaving little for other expenses.\n\n“It’s a domino effect,” Kenney noted. “Her lack of pay means I don’t get paid, requiring me to cut back, affecting others downstream.”\n\nKenney blames Democrats for the shutdown due to VP JD Vance’s claim that extending healthcare subsidies will aid undocumented immigrants, a view rejected by Democrats and budget analysts.\n\nBlows to small business\n\nIn Tampa, the shutdown cost Steve Egan a $4,000 sale after a Veterans Affairs hospital cancelled its order for beaded necklaces for the Gasparilla Pirate Festival due to withdrawal from the event.\n\nFlight delays and longer customs processing times have also forced Egan, 65, to shorten the lead time he can offer clients for overseas orders.\n\nWhen a sheriff’s office needed 300 T-shirts for a November event, Egan found a good overseas supplier deal.\n\nUsually, clients have 45 days to decide, but due to shipping uncertainties, Egan could only offer half that time, which was too tight.\n\nEgan, who has previously expressed regret for his Trump vote, blames both parties for the shutdown.\n\nHe wants Republicans to compromise on healthcare subsidies, urging them to fund it.\n\nRobert Billups, a 34-year-old accountant in Washington state, feels pressured by the shutdown. He worries federal cuts will intensify competition in an already tight job market.\n\nHis last interview was for a government contractor role, and he suspects the position went to a recently terminated federal employee who already had the required security clearance.\n\nMeanwhile, his mother, an IRS contractor, has been furloughed since mid-October, worsening her job anxiety caused by federal workforce cuts since early 2025.\n\nWhile his mother blames Republicans for the stalemate, Billups understands their spending limits’ focus.\n\nHe sees no winner, stating the polarisation harms both sides.\n\nAnxiety for non-furloughed\n\nFederal employees with paychecks are anxious. Amanda Taylor, 52, in Georgia fears her husband’s federal job may be at risk if the shutdown continues.\n\nDespite having voted for President Joe Biden in 2020, she blames Democrats “100pc for the shutdown”.\n\nShe criticised Democrats for tying Obamacare supplements to the budget, noting they’re not expired yet, and suggested passing the budget first.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 9th, 2025",
