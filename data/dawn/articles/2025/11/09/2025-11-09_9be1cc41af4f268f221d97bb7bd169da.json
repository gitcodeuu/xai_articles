Therefore, no constitutional amendment, legislation, or executive action can lawfully diminish or extinguish this jurisdiction vested in the Supreme Court, the petition argued.\n\nIt sought a declaration that any attempt to establish a parallel or superior forum styled as a constitutional court, distinct from or in substitution of the SC or the high courts, would be repugnant to Articles 175 to 191 of the Constitution.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 8th, 2025",
