  "content": "KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday launched a new digital platform, opening another channel for individuals and corporates to invest in government securities.\n\nAccording to the SBP, web portal InvestPak has been developed to digitise the process of investing in government papers for customers maintaining rupee accounts with banks, primary dealers (PDs) and microfinance banks (MFBs).\n\nGovernment securities are currently issued through auctions of Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) and Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs). In addition, the government has recently begun raising funds through the stock market using Sukuk bonds. Advertisements\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                X\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, investment in government securities had reached Rs46.566 trillion. Scheduled banks held Rs38.7tr, or 83 per cent of the total, while corporates held Rs7.856tr, or 17pc. The inclusion of individual investors through InvestPak is expected to further increase investment in government papers and add to the government’s already substantial domestic borrowing.\n\nIndividuals, corporates can now invest via InvestPak\n\nThe SBP said the portal enables customers of financial institutions (FIs) to digitally open Investor Portfolio of Sec­urities (IPS) accounts, place bids in primary auctions, and buy or sell securities in the secondary market — all without visiting a bank or financial institution.\n\n“All banks are mandated to facilitate their customers in registering on the portal. MFBs are also encouraged to help their customers register. All FIs must ensure high service standards and a smooth user experience,” the SBP said in a circular issued on Thursday.\n\nFIs have been granted access to the portal, which caters to both primary auctions and secondary market trading of government securities. They can also customise their treasury operations across front, middle, and back offices to align with the new system.\n\nAll individuals, joint account holders, and corporates with rupee bank accounts are eligible to register digitally on the portal using their IBAN (International Bank Account Number).\n\nCustomers who do not already hold an IPS account can request its opening through the portal when registering with their respective financial institution.\n\n“The portal allows individuals and corporates to link and operate multiple rupee and IPS accounts across different FIs through a single registered account,” the SBP said.\n\nFIs are required to process each registration or onboarding request and communicate their decision to the customer within two working days.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 7th, 2025",
