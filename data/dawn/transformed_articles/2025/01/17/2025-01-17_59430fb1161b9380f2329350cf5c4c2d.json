    "article_body": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti has expressed his disappointment over the failure to develop the industrial town of Hub into a modern city with all basic amenities, despite its proximity to Karachi. Speaking at a public gathering in Hub on Thursday during his visit to the industrial town, he said that despite several chief ministers hailing from Lasbela district, no serious efforts had been made to develop and transform Hub into a modern and well-planned city. He announced the establishment of a modern nursing college in Hub, named after Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, which will provide nursing education to both men and women from Hub and the entire Kalat division. He emphasised the growing importance of nursing as a field of study. The chief minister expressed concern over the poor condition of the Jam Ghulam Qadir Government Hospital in Hub, announcing that the government plans to hand it over to Indus Hospital under a public-private partnership model. Bugti announces establishment of modern nursing college in industrial town He also mentioned that further measures would be taken to improve healthcare facilities in Hub. He highlighted the importance of workers and assured that steps would be taken for their welfare. Recognising Hub as an industrial city, he mentioned efforts to provide affordable electricity through solar energy in collaboration with K-Electric to strengthen industries in Hub. He also appealed to industrialists who had left Hub to return and re-establish their industries, assuring them of full protection. The chief minister announced a grant of Rs250 million each for the District Council Hub and Municipal Corporation Hub. He also granted tehsil status to Sakran and town committee status to Lohi, based on their populations. Meeting with industrialists During his visit, CM Bugti met a delegation of Hub industrialists, led by the Chamber of Commerce president Ismail Sattar. He assured the delegation of full support for industrialists and emphasised the government's commitment to creating a conducive environment in industrial zones. The delegation informed the chief minister about issues and developmental needs of the Hub Industrial Estate. Mr Bugti promised immediate steps to address these concerns, including ensuring the provision of water to the estate and directing the district administration to implement appropriate security measures. He reiterated that Hub is the industrial hub of Balochistan and its development remains a top priority for the government. A comprehensive policy is being implemented to revitalise and stabilise Hub's industries. Abdul Wahid Shahwani in Khuzdar also contributed to this report. Published in Dawn, January 17th, 2025",
