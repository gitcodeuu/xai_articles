    "article_body": "QUETTA: The Balochistan government has taken serious notice of doctors allegedly drawing double salaries and initiated action against 74 male and female doctors working on deputation with UN organisations in Balochistan and other provinces. This was disclosed by Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Muhammad Kakar, who also revealed the names of the doctors involved. The list includes 36 medical officers, 29 female doctors and nine dental surgeons, some of whom are reportedly members of the Young Doctors Association (YDA). \"The health department, after identifying the issue, has served notices to these 74 doctors and decided to take legal action,\" Mr Kakar said. He added that the department has compiled evidence of corruption and plans to file FIRs against the accused doctors. The health department has also sought details of contract doctors from international organisations, including UN bodies, to ensure transparency. YDA protests over 'retaliatory actions' \"Doctors whose deputation periods have ended will be instructed to return to their parent departments,\" said the minister. He emphasised that the government would not tolerate irregularities in the health sector, noting that the actions of a few have tarnished the reputation of the medical profession. \"The closure of hospitals is unbearable for poor patients, and the sight of their suffering is heartbreaking,\" he said. Balochistan government spokesperson Shahid Rind said the list of implicated doctors highlighted vested interests harming the healthcare system. Young doctors protest govt actions Meanwhile, the Young Doctors Association Pakistan has announced a two-hour token strike in outpatient departments (OPDs) nationwide from Friday (today) to support the Grand Health Alliance (GHA) Balochistan. The YDA also condemned what it called retaliatory actions against its members and warned that a complete OPD boycott would begin on Monday if the alleged harassment continued. In a statement, YDA Pakistan condemned the false cases against the office-bearers of the Young Doctors Association Balochistan. The GHA has observed a strike for the last four days, with all doctors and other staff in hospitals across the province abstaining from duties in support of their demands. OPDs and elective surgeries remain suspended in several major hospitals, including Sandeman Provincial Hospital Quetta, Bolan Medical Complex Hospital Quetta, Sheikh Zayed Hospital and Benazir Bhutto Shaheed Hospital. Other affected facilities include Mufti Mehmood Hospital Kuchlak, Fatima Jinnah Hospital Quetta and teaching hospitals in Khuzdar, Chaman, Turbat and Qila Saifullah, as well as district headquarters hospitals.
