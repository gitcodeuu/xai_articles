    "article_body": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti attended a peace jirga of tribes during his visit to Sui, where he successfully resolved a 15-year-long bloody dispute between the Masuri and Kalpar Hotkani clans of the Bugti tribe. The feud had resulted in the deaths of nearly 10 people. During the jirga, both parties entrusted the chief minister with full authority to facilitate reconciliation. CM Bugti played a key role in mediating the discussions, leading to an understanding and the end of long-standing tensions. Following the agreement, both parties prayed for each other's well-being and embraced, putting an end to their enmity. Published in Dawn, January 17th, 2025",
