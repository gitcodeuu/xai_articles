The chief secretary expressed serious concern about the recent 16 polio cases reported in Dera Ismail Khan division, including 11 in Dera Ismail Khan district and five in Tank district. He said that targets for anti-polio campaigns should be met and a vaccination plan should be fully implemented to save children from the crippling disease. Chief secy says fake finger marking won't be tolerated \"To ensure access to every child, updated models and patterns should be adopted, \" he said, promising full support of the administration for the purpose. He said fixed vaccination points should be established to the convenience of people. The chief secretary said activities related to follow-up vaccinations should continue alongside regular campaigns. Officials informed him about the performance of education, social welfare, tourism, industries, health, and other departments regarding the anti-polio fight and issued orders for better public awareness and facilities for vaccination. The chief secretary also said all available resources were being utilised for the promotion of tourism. During a briefing on the security situation in the region, officials told the chief secretary that changes were being made to the strategy for protecting public life and property. IGP Akhtar Hayat Khan emphasised the need for controlling the recent surge in vaccination refusals, saying polio vaccination is a national duty for children's better health and development. He said that all resources were being utilised not only for the security of anti-polio teams but also to improve the overall security situation in the province. The chief secretary directed authorities to engage local influencers and mosque imams for including their statements about the importance of anti-polio vaccination in sermons. He also said all relevant departments should utilise social media platforms to create public awareness of polio. Mr Chaudhry said fake finger marking would not be tolerated, with culprits facing strict action. He and the IGP later visited the Police Training School in Dera Ismail Khan and examined progress on projects, including a rest house, residences and facilities for police personnel training.
