    "article_body": "QUETTA: The chairman of the Hazara Democratic Party (HDP) and former Balochistan sports minister, Abdul Khaliq Hazara, was injured during an attempted robbery at his residence in the Marri Abad area of Quetta late on Thursday night. According to police, the assailant, who was later identified as Mr Hazara's neighbour, scaled the wall of his house and broke in. Mr Hazara confronted the intruder and tried to overpower him, during which he was struck with an object and sustained injuries. The suspect fled the scene after the altercation. Family members and neighbours rushed to the scene and shifted the injured HDP leader to Shaheed Benazir Bhutto Hospital. \"Mr Hazara received injuries at his head, but his condition is stable,\" a police official said. Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti took notice of the incident and directed the inspector general of police (IGP) to submit a detailed report. Government spokesperson Shahid Rind contacted Mr Hazara's family to inquire about the incident and conveyed the chief minister's well-wishes for a speedy recovery. Mr Rind confirmed that the suspect had been arrested. DIG Police Aitzaz Ahmed Goraya said an investigation was underway to determine the motive behind the attack and to ensure justice is served. Later, CM Bugti personally contacted Mr Hazara to check on his health and assured him that the incident was being thoroughly investigated. Published in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
