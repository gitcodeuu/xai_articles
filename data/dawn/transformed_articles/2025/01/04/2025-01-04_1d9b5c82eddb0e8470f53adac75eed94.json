    "article_body": "KARACHI: Fast bowler Niaz Khan picked up five wickets to help Peshawar bundle out Sialkot for 245 on the second day of the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy final here at the UBL Sports Complex on Friday. Peshawar in their first innings on Friday had posted 258. Pacer Mohammad Amir Khan backed up Niaz's 5-61 show with three wickets for 38 runs in 21 overs. Niaz, who sent down 26 overs in the innings, took his tally of wickets to 35 in the tournament - second best to Musa Khan (38) - with his fourth first-class five-for. Sialkot lost prolific opener Azan Awais (18) and Ashir Mehmood (five) early in the first session with 38 runs on the board in 14.3 overs after resuming from their overnight score of eight for no loss. At this juncture, Mohammad Huraira (55 off 127 balls) joined Mohsin Riaz (57 off 130 balls) as they added 102 runs for the third wicket off 33.1 overs. With Huraira's departure in the 48th over, Sialkot started sliding losing their last seven wickets for just 105 runs. Batting at No.6, Ahsan Hafeez Bhatti chipped in with 26 and Shahzaib Bhatti's 47-ball 40 helped Sialkot erase much of the deficit. Apart from the pace duo of Niaz and Amir, skipper Sajid Khan claimed one wicket. Peshawar, in their second innings, faced just one over before the close of play scoring five runs.
