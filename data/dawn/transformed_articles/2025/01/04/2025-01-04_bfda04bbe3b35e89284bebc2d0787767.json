The NCHR had urged the police authorities to ensure that all detainees must be treated in accordance with the law and their fundamental rights must be respected. There should be no torture, inhuman or degrading treatment of any individual in custody. Immediate measures should be taken to verify and release those arrested without just cause or evidence of unlawful activity.
