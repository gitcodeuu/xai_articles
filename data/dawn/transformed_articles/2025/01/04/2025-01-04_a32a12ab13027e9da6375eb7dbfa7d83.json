Accompanied by District Police Officer Shafiullah Khan Gandapur, Mr Satti also held a meeting with army officials to discuss security and other relevant matters. Mr Satti praised Chinese nationals for contributing to Pakistan's development and prosperity. DIG visits site of Balakot power project \"You [Chinese engineers and workers] have been executing energy projects from Mansehra to Kohistan in the Hazara division and otherparts of the country to address Pakistan's power shortfall, so we highly appreciate your efforts and are ready to go to every extent to protect your lives,\" he said. Addressing police personnel deployed for the security of Chinese nationals, Mr Satti emphasised zero tolerance for negligence. \"You must ensure that no unauthorised person gains access to project sites, while the movement of Chinese engineers and workers should be managed in line with stringent security protocols,\" he said. The DIG said that a multi-layered security mechanism, which was already in place for the safety of Chinese engineers, should be strengthened to foil any mishap.
