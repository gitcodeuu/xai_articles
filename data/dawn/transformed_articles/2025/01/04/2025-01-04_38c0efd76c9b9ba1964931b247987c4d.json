    "article_body": "QUETTA: Quetta and parts of northern and central Balochistan were gripped by icy Siberian winds on Friday following a new spell of winter rains and snowfall that brought temperatures below freezing. The rainfall, forecast by the Meteorological Department, began early in the morning in Quetta and its surrounding areas, continuing intermittently throughout the day. Rain was also reported in Pishin, Ziarat, Muslim Bagh, Kozak Pass, Khanozai, Qila Saifullah, Kalat and other regions. By evening, snowfall had begun in many northern parts of the province, accompanied by strong Siberian winds. According to reports, heavy snowfall in Ziarat, Kan Mehtarzai, Khanozai and Muslim Bagh caused roads to become slippery, disrupting traffic. Local administrations advised residents to avoid unnecessary travel. Efforts were underway by authorities, including Levies and police, to clear icy roads and ensure safe passage. \"Ziarat has been receiving heavy snowfall since this evening, which has disrupted road connectivity with other areas,\" local journalist Mudassir Kakar told Dawn by phone. He said the suspension of gas supply in the valley had also created hardships for residents. Similar disruptions in gas supply were reported in Pishin, Mastung and Kalat, with many areas of Quetta also experiencing low gas pressure, leaving residents struggling to stay warm in freezing temperatures. Meanwhile, reports suggested that Nokundi, Noshki, Dalbandin and regions along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border were also experiencing icy conditions. The Meteorological Department has predicted more rain and snowfall across parts of Balochistan over the next 24 hours. Published in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
