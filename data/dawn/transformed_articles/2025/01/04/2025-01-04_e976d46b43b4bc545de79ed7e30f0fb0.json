    "article_body": "QUETTA: A 4.7-magnitude earthquake struck the Sibi region on Friday, causing residents in the town and surrounding areas to flee their homes and seek shelter under the open sky. According to officials, the tremor was felt around 5:40am, lasting for around 30 seconds, creating panic among the local population. According to the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) in Islamabad, the earthquake had a depth of 18 kilometres, with coordinates 29.34N and 67.93E. The epicenter was located about 22km southeast of Sibi. People rushed to open spaces, leaving their homes behind. However, no casualties or major property damage were reported in Sibi town or the surrounding areas. \"We have sent survey teams to assess the situation in the affected areas, but fortunately, no one was hurt or killed in the moderate earthquake,\" a senior official from the Sibi administration said. However, the official added that cracks were reported in a few mud houses on the outskirts of Sibi town. This earthquake was the second to hit Balochistan within a week. On Dec 28, an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.1 struck Chaman and Qila Abdullah districts. Sibi is an area prone to seismic activity due to its proximity to the boundary between the Eurasian and Indian tectonic plates. While earthquakes in this region are not uncommon, they can vary in magnitude and impact. Balochistan has experienced several significant earthquakes over the years, often resulting in damage to infrastructure and loss of life. Published in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
