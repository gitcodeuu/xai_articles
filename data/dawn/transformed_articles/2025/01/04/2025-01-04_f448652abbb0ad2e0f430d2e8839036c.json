The authorities confiscated 1,541kg of plastic bags to ensure compliance with environment regulations. Senior Provincial Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb said the fight for environmental protection would continue with no leniency shown in the campaign against smog and air pollution. She emphasised that providing a clean and healthy environment remains the government's top priority. Published in Dawn, January 4th, 2025",
