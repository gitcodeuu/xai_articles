    "article_body": "IPSWICH: Enzo Maresca admitted Chelsea should not think about challenging for the Premier League title after lowly Ipswich beat the Blues 2-0 at Portman Road on Monday while Newcastle United beat Manchester United 2-0 at Old Trafford, an ugly culmination of one of the most miserable months in the home side's recent memory. Maresca's side were rocked by Liam Delap's early penalty and a second-half goal from former Chelsea winger Omari Hutchinson. Chelsea's second successive defeat after their Boxing Day loss against Fulham left them without a win in their last three matches. The west Londoners had emerged as surprise title contenders after an eight-match winning run in all competitions. But Maresca had insisted throughout that spell that Chelsea's inexperienced squad do not have what it takes to win the title in his first season after arriving from Leicester City. And the Italian's prediction looks spot on after a shock result in Suffolk that leaves Chelsea in fourth place, 10 points behind leaders Liverpool, who have a game in hand. \"We focus game by game. We are not focused on title race or those things,\" Maresca said. \"It was a strange game. We had many chances but we could do many things better, defend better in some moments. \"Now we've finished the first part of the season, no one expected us to be where we are. It's a long race.\" Third-bottom Ipswich climb within one point of safety after winning for the second time in their last four matches. Kieran McKenna's side have renewed belief they can avoid relegation back to the Championship thanks to their first top-flight home win in 22 years. \"Special night for the club. First home win in the Premier League at Portman Road for 22 years and to do it against Chelsea was fantastic,\" McKenna said. \"Most of the supporters who have been here for 22 years, every moment here is a landmark for them. Winning the home game is another special little landmark. But I think the time of year, the night game, the opponent make this a special night and I want everyone to enjoy it a lot.\" Meanwhile, Alexander Isak and Joelinton scored one goal each for Newcastle to hand Manchester United their fifth loss in last six league games. The result left United languishing on 14th in the standings with 19 points, their worst placing to end a calendar year since they were 15th in 1989. Newcastle are fifth on 32 points. \"One of the more difficult moments in the history of Manchester United,\" said manager Ruben Amorim, who called the team's position in the table embarrassing. \"It's a very difficult moment, but we have to fight to win the next game.\" Isak got the visitors on the scoresheet in the fourth minute when he leapt to head home a pinpoint cross from Lewis Hall with both Harry Maguire and Lisandro Martinez failing to pick him up. It was the 11th goal in 11 games for Isak, who has scored more Premier League goals in December than any other player with eight. Newcastle doubled their lead in the 19th minute in near carbon copy fashion with Anthony Gordon sending in a cross that Joelinton headed in. The win marked Newcastle's second victory at Old Trafford in 40 league visits, dating back to 1972. \"We know the hurt this fixture has had for us historically, it wasn't lost on us,\" Newcastle boss Eddie Howe said. \"We didn't necessarily use that with the players, but it was a big step forward for us today. I think we need to win games like this to achieve what we want on a regular basis.\" It is also the first time since 1979 that Manchester United have lost three consecutive league games at home. Their 18 goals conceded in all competitions in December is their most in a single month since March 1964 (also 18). Amorim also conceded that the threat of relegation is a reality that United is facing at the moment. \"I think (relegation) is a possibility and we have to be clear with our fans. We have to change something but this season will be really hard on everybody,\" Amorim said. In Monday's other fixture, Brighton & Hove Albion's Tariq Lamptey drove home a late equaliser to earn his side a point in a lively 2-2 draw at Aston Villa. Simon Adingra put Brighton ahead but Villa staged a comeback with an Ollie Watkins penalty and a Morgan Rogers effort just after the interval. Still the Seagulls deservedly left with a share of the spoils. Lamptey was played in by Joao Pedro's clever flick and volleyed home first-time in the 81st minute. Villa remained in ninth place with 29 points from 19 games with Brighton's second draw of the festive period leaving them two points behind in 10th spot. Published in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
