    "article_body": "CHINIOT: Three members of a family drowned as their car plunged into a nullah on Rajoa Road near Thatti Mochian due to fog and poor visibility on Monday night. The family, residents of Mohallah Husainabad in Chiniot, was traveling to Faisalabad when their car, driven by Muhammad Ahmad (21), failed to differentiate between the bridge and the edges of the nullah, plunging into the water. The car quickly filled with dirty water, trapping the passengers inside. Passersby called Rescue 1122, who arrived to rescue the family. Khadeeja Bibi (25), Kalsoom Bibi (40) and one-year-old Hoorain Fatima could not be saved. The bodies of the two women were recovered, but the child's body was found the next day after a thorough search of the nullah by rescue workers using boats and nets. The driver, Muhammad Ahmad, and another family member, Muhammad Aslam (21), sustained injuries and were shifted to DHQ Hospital for treatment. Published in Dawn, January 1st, 2025",
