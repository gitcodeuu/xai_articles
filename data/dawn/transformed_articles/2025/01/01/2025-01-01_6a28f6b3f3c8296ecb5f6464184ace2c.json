    "article_body": "LAHORE: Punjab is currently grappling with severe weather conditions as dense fog blankets various cities, causing significant disruptions in daily life and travel. The thick fog has led to the closure of multiple sections of the motorway, creating inconvenience for commuters and travelers. According to the Motorway Police, the motorway has been closed from M2 Thokar Niaz Beg to Kot Momin due to heavy fog. Additionally, the M3 from Lahore to Abdul Hakeem, the M4 from Abdul Hakeem to Multan and the M5 from Sher Shah Multan to Zahir Pir have also been shut down. The Lahore-Sialkot motorway is similarly affected, with closures in place to ensure public safety. The dense fog has severely impacted visibility, making it hazardous for vehicles to navigate the roads. The Motorway Police have advised drivers to use alternative routes, such as the Grand Trunk (GT) Road, and to exercise caution by driving slowly and using fog lights. They have also urged the public to avoid unnecessary travel and to stay indoors whenever possible. In addition to the motorway closures, the fog has disrupted traffic on several national highways across the province. Cities like Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, and Gujranwala are among the most affected, with visibility dropping to dangerously low levels. Authorities have issued warnings and are closely monitoring the situation to prevent accidents and ensure public safety. Motorway Police spokesperson Syed Imran Ahmed has advised citizens to prefer traveling between 10am and 6pm and to ensure lane discipline. He emphasised that the motorways were closed for the safety of citizens and urged drivers to use fog lights on their vehicles. Meanwhile, the Meteorological Department has forecast the entry of western winds into the upper regions of the country. Rain is expected in most districts of Punjab from Jan 2 to 6, with the possibility of increased cold due to rain and snowfall. The PDMA spokesperson has predicted rain in Sargodha, Mianwali, Bhakkar, Khushab, Hafizabad, Gujranwala, Mandi Bahauddin, and Gujrat, as well as in Lahore, Toba Tek Singh, Jhang, Faisalabad, Sheikhupura, Narowal and Sialkot. Light rain is also expected in Multan, Dera Ghazi Khan, Layyah, Muzaffargarh, Khanewal, Sahiwal, Pakpattan, Okara and Bahawalnagar. Snowfall is forecast in Murree, Gilyat, and other hilly areas from Jan 1 to 6. The PDMA Punjab spokesperson has advised tourists to be extremely cautious according to the weather conditions and to plan their programmes accordingly. PDMA DG Irfan Ali Kathia stated that the PDMA control room is monitoring the situation 24/7 and urged citizens to avoid unnecessary travel in bad weather conditions.
