    "article_body": "MANSEHRA: The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government has approved funds for two major road projects in Balakot tehsil. \"Residents have long been calling for the construction of Saiful Muluk Lake Road and Garhi Habibullah-Balakot Road, so the communication and works department has sanctioned funds for them,\" MPA Munir Hussain Lughmani told reporters here on Tuesday. He said he met with the chief engineer of the communication and works department's foreign aided projects division, Engineer Mohammad Naveed, and learned about the approval of funds for both Balakot road projects. \"Work on the roads will commence once the weather conditions improve,\" he said. MPA says work to begin as weather conditions improve Mr Lughmani said he expected the construction of the Balakot-Garhi Habibullah Road project would begin soon, while the Saiful Muluk Lake Road project would be launched after the Mansehra-Naran-Jalkhad Road was reopened to traffic in May 2025. He said the road linking Naran, the commercial hub of Kaghan Valley, with Saiful Muluk Lake was in a dilapidated condition, badly impacting tourism in the region. \"Our government is promoting tourism, and once this road is constructed, visitors will have a much better travel experience to move to Saiful Muluk Lake,\" he said. Mr Lughmani said that funds had been approved for some other development projects in Balakot tehsil. PROTESTED: Residents of Lassan Nawab took to the streets on Tuesday against land grabbers, accusing them of seizing properties with the support of the revenue department. \"The influential land grabbers have deprived me and other residents of our houses and land,\" Mohammad Akram told protesters. The protesters gathered from various parts of Lassan Nawab at the main bazaar and shoutedslogans against land grabbers and revenue department while holding banners and placards. \"The land grabbers are so influential and powerful that even after approaching the higher-ups in the revenue department, we have been denied our rights,\" Mr Akram said. He urged the district police officer to form a special task force to crack down on land grabbers and identify their supporters in departments. \"We approached the police to retrieve our house from the land grabbers, but they couldn't take action,\" he said. Another protester claimed that organised criminal groups were involved in depriving people of their plots, houses, and other properties. A police team, led by superintendent of police Rashim Jehangir, held talks with protesters. \"The police will ensure that all land-grabbing cases and similar complaints are addressed on a priority basis,\" Ms Jehangir assured. She added that DPO Shafiullah Khan Gandapur had already ordered a crackdown on outlaws in the area. \"We are supposed to protect your life and property. You should report cases of land grabbing to the police,\" she told protesters. The mob dispersed peacefully after receiving assurance of action against land grabbers.
