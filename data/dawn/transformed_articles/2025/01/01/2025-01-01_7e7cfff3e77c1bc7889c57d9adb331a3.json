The committee participants said such practices were unacceptable and must not recur, adding that such negligence would not be tolerated in future. In light of these concerns, the committee resolved to summon the secretary, Ministry of Energy (Power Division), along with the CEOs of the aforementioned companies in the next meeting for further deliberation, says a press release. Chief executive officers (CEOs) of Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco), Sukkur Electric Power Company (Sepco), and Hyderabad Electric Supply Company (Hesco) had been summoned to the meeting of the National Assembly Standing Committee on Rules of Procedure and Privileges to clarify their positions regarding different complaints related to power sector in their respective areas. Regarding privilege motions, MNAs Shagufta Jumani and Waseem Qadir accepted the unconditional apologies tendered by the managing director of Pak Arab Refinery Limited (Parco) and the CEO of Lahore Waste Management Company (LWMC), respectively. Following this, the privilege motions were disposed of. Shagufta Jumani highlighted the issue of unannounced loadshedding in Hyderabad and requested to be invited as a special invitee to the forthcoming meeting. The committee approved her request. The meeting was presided over by MNA Mohammad Afzal and was attended by Syed Imran Ahmed Shah, Azhar Qayyum Nahra, Sardar Mohammad Yaqoob Khan Nasar, Zulfiqar Sattar Bachani, Mir Ghulam Ali Talpur and Ramesh Lal.
