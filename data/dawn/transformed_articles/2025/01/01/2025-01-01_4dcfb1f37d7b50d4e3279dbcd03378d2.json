    "article_body": "KARACHI: The KSE-100 index closed its final trading session of 2024 at 115,127 points on Tuesday, down 0.11 per cent (132 points), as profit-taking in key sectors trimmed gains from earlier in the day. Banks, fertilisers and exploration and productionstocks saw selling pressure, with companies like Fauji Fertiliser Company, MCB Bank, Bank Al Habib, Bank Alfalah and Engro Corporation leading the decline, losing 424 points collectively. Despite the slight dip on the last session of the year, the KSE-100 ended 2024 with an unprecedented 84pc gain, the highest annual return in 22 years, driven by improved economic conditions and a stable political environment, the brokerage house Topline Research said. The index added 52,676 points in 2024, making it the second-best performing market globally in US dollar terms, behind Argentina, according to Bloomberg data. The KSE-100's stellar performance was powered by contributions from banks (13,847 points), fertilisers (11,169 points), and E&P (10,012 points). These sectors collectively accounted for 66pc of the index's gains, according to Arif Habib Limited. Key performers included FFC, which added 6,086 points, Mari Petroleum (3,977 points), United Bank Limited (UBL) (3,957 points), and Oil & Gas Development Company (2,613 points).

The futures market also saw significant growth, with daily volumes rising 68pc to 184m shares and traded value up 80pc to Rs8bn. The rally was underpinned by falling inflation, declining yields on fixed-income instruments, aggressive monetary easing of 900 basis points by the State Bank of Pakistan and a stable rupee. These improvements, coupled with political stability under the new IMF programme, bolstered investor confidence.
