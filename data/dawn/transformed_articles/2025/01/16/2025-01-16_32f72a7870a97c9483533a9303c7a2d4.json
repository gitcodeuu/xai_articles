    "article_body": "MULTAN: Insisting that the hosts have made good preparations for the forthcoming Test series against the West Indies, Pakistan spinner Nauman Ali on Wednesday said the conditions in Multan will support spinners. \"Our preparations [for the Test series] have been excellent. We are focused on maintaining the momentum from our previous performances [in Tests],\" Nauman said while talking to reporters at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Wednesday. Reflecting on the strategic decisions made during the recently-concluded tour of South Africa where Pakistan despite showing resilience suffered a 2-0 whitewash, the spinner appreciated the team management's approach in adapting to challenging situations. Pakistan face the West Indies in a two-Test series starting on Friday. Both the Tests will be staged in Multan. Both the teams practised at the Multan Cricket Stadium on Wednesday Nauman, who as slow left-arm orthodox spinner has claimed 67 wickets in 17 Tests so far, credited the team's success to the well-thought-out strategies and emphasised their importance in high-pressure games. The spinner remains optimistic about doing well under spin-friendly conditions in Multan. \"Historically, the pitches here have supported spinners. And I will try our best to utilize these conditions to my advantage and improve my performance further,\" he said. Attributing his commitment to fitness, the 38-year-old maintained that his physical condition has improved significantly and that he was committed to enhancing it further. Nauman took 20 wickets in the final two home Tests - including one in Multan - which Pakistan won against England on spin-friendly tracks last October. These wins enabled the Shan Masood-led team to make a magnificent comeback to claim the three-match series after losing the opener by an innings and 47 runs in Multan. He also lauded Pakistan's pace attack insisting their impactful performances in recent matches. \"The contributions made by our fast bowlers have been crucial. [Therefore] their form will be a significant factor in the team's success in the upcoming series,\" Nauman maintained. 'WI TO STAY FOCUSED ON STRATEGY' West Indies head coach Andre Coley emphasised his team's clarity in planning and strategising, particularly when it comes to setting targets during the match. \"Our plan regarding scores is clear, but the actual target can only be determined on the game day itself,\" the coach told reporters during his media talk at the Multan Cricket Stadium. He highlighted the importance of adaptability and staying focused on the present target rather than dwelling on past performances. \"I prefer to focus on the current situation rather than the past,\" he expressed adding, \"every match is a new opportunity, where our focus lies\". Talking about his team's journey, Coley admitted that the year 2024 brought a mix of successes and challenges for the West Indies. \"We have learned a great deal from [the] last year, both from our good performances and the areas where we fell short,\" he said. The head coach said that every experience has contributed to the West Indies team's growth. \"As a coach, my learning never stops,\" he said. \"Each match and every situation provide valuable lessons to the players.\" Published in Dawn, January 16th, 2025",
