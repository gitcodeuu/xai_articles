    "article_body": "RAWALPINDI: A man was shot dead while his gunman was injured outside an Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) in Rawalpindi on Wednesday. The daylight attack poked holes in security measures put in place for visitors and suspects facing cases registered under anti-terrorism charges. According to sources, the assailants fled the scene after carrying out the deadly attack as security personnel watched helplessly. They said the ATC's parking lot where the attack was carried out is situated in close proximity to the Rawalpindi commissioner, deputy commissioner and Saddar superintendent of police's offices - places guarded heavily. The victim was identified as Raja Danial Iqbal, purportedly associated with the real estate business, from Gujar Khan. Sources said the deceased had arrived with his gunman Asim Rashid to appear in a hearing to avail himself a pre-arrest bail when suspects believed to be sent by his rivals allegedly opened gunfire, fatally injuring him. The pre-arrest bail was related to a murder case registered with the Gujar Khan police on December 17, 2024, on the complaint of a man named Abdul Basit. Danial Iqbal had been nominated in the murder case of a man identified as Abdul Rehman. Sources confirmed that 35-year-old property dealer Abdul Rehman was gunned down by his rivals in Gujar Khan. Shortly after the incident, the injured were rushed to Benazir Bhutto Hospital (BBH) where Raja Iqbal Danial succumbed to his injuries while his guard was stated to be in critical condition. A Rawalpindi police spokesperson said that police officials from the Civil Lines police station reached the spot and collected evidence from the crime scene. According to the initial investigation, the incident stemmed from an old enmity. However, the police will probe the case from various angles, he said. Published in Dawn, January 16th, 2025",
