    "article_body": "SANAA: Yemen's Houthi fighters said on Wednesday that they had carried out a missile and drone attack on a US aircraft carrier in the Red Sea, though the American military declined to confirm whether its forces had come under fire. The Houthis said in a statement that they targeted the USS Harry S. Truman and several accompanying warships in the northern Red Sea as part of a \"military operation\". The fighters said they used \"winged missiles and drones\" during the vessels' \"attempt to carry out operations\" against Yemen. A US defence official did not confirm an attack had taken place, but said: \"All personnel are safe and accounted for and ... there has been no damage to any US vessels or equipment.\" Since the Gaza crisis unfolded on Oct 7, 2023, the Houthis have repeatedly launched missiles and drones at ships in the Red Sea and at targets in Israel in a show of solidarity with the Palestinians. The United States and Britain have repeatedly struck Houthi targets in defence of the vital shipping lane, while Israel has also carried out attacks in Houthi-held areas.
