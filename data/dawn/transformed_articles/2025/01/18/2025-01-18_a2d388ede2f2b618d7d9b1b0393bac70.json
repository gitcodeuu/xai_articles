    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: The Senate session was abruptly adjourned on Friday even before the completion of Question Hour, denying an opportunity to the opposition leader to speak, in a clear deviation from the parliamentary tradition. Leader of the Opposition Shibli Faraz wanted to speak on the conviction of Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi, but deputy chairman of Senate Syedaal Khan Nasar refused to give him the floor, saying that under rule 41, Question Hour has to be completed first, leading to uproar in the house. \"This is my prerogative to speak,\" Leader of the Opposition in the Senate Shibli Faraz could be heard with his mic turned off. He was referring to a parliamentary convention, whereby the chair customarily recognises the leaders of the house or the opposition if they seek an opportunity to speak. Other PTI members started protesting when the chairman insisted he would not allow Senator Faraz to speak during Question Hour. This prompted the deputy chairman to abruptly adjourned the house, to meet again on Monday. Soon after the announcement by the chair, PTI lawmakers gathered close to his dais and chanted slogans against what they called \"black laws and verdicts\", \"travesty of justice\" and \"a witch-hunt\". Earlier, during Question Hour, the Senate was informed that data protection and privacy measures were in place to prevent misuse of information available at the National Sex Offenders Register, launched in November last year. Answering a question asked by Senator Quratul Ain Marri on behalf of the interior minister, Law Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar said it was an end-to-end encrypted system and under the rules, its public disclosure was not allowed. About details of authorised institutions and personnel having access to sensitive information along with the penalties for unauthorised access or misuse of the register, he said those found to be involved in leakage of protected data in deviation from their official duties and responsibilities would face action.
