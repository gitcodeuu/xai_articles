    "article_body": "LAKKI MARWAT: Jamaat-i-Islami organised thanksgiving rallies across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Friday to celebrate the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. Jamaat's South KP chief Mohammad Ibrahim led a rally in Bannu, which appeared from Havaid Gate and converged in front of the press club. Party district emir Mufti Arifullah, secretary general Ejazul Haq Soorani and a good number of activists participated. Speaking on the occasion, Mr Ibrahim said Israel continued a genocidal campaign against Palestinians for the last one and half years, but the brave people of Gaza refused to surrender. Activists laud Palestinians' bravery in face of Israeli aggression \"Despite the agreement, Israel continued bombarding people,\" he said. He said over 40,000 people were killed in the Israeli aggression but Muslim countries 'kept mum' over the brutalities. \"The blood of martyrs will herald the freedom of Palestine,\" he maintained. A rally was also taken out in Karak to express solidarity with Palestinians. JI South KP secretary general Mohammad Zahoor Khattak, deputy emir Maulana Taslim Iqbal, district emir Sadiqullah Shaheen and Maulana Mehboob Janan led the rally. The participants carried placards and banners inscribed with slogans in favour of Palestinians. Speakers said the agreement had brought happiness on the faces of Gaza people. They said after implementation of the agreement, the United States would try to force Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other Muslim countries to recognise Israel. They warned the government of stiff resistance if it thought about recognising the Jewish state. In Lakki Marwat, JI's district chief Mufti Irfanullah and secretary general Ismail at a presser in Naurang town said that the illegitimate state of Israel could not be recognised under any circumstances.
