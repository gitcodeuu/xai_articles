    "article_body": "KARACHI: The ongoing teachers' strike at public-sector universities gathered more steam on Friday when the Higher Education Commission (HEC) put its weight behind two of their key demands and urged the Sindh chief minister to consider the autonomous status of universities and withdraw a proposed amendment to the Sindh Universities and Institutes Laws Act. The amendment may allow non-PhD candidates and bureaucrats to become vice chancellors of higher learning institutes. In a letter addressed to Sindh CM Murad Ali Shah, a copy of which is available with Dawn, HEC Chairman Dr Mukhtar Ahmed described the plan to appoint non-academicians as vice chancellors as a \"retrogressive\" step, while reminding the provincial government of an important relevant decision of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) taken at its 44th meeting dated April 7, 2021. According to this decision, \"Higher Education Commission will be the sole standard setting national organisation with regard to higher education in the country.\" Dr Mukhtar urges CM Murad to withdraw proposed amendment to universities law; teachers' boycott of academic activities continues He writes, \"The Amendment, if passed, would bring significant changes in the basic eligibility criteria and would enable the non-PhDs to apply and be considered for selection to the revered position of the Vice Chancellor/Head of the Institution, hence paving way for the appointment of non-academicians - a retrogressive step which will not only have serious consequences on the academic standards, but would also affect academic freedom and critical thinking.\" It might compromise upon the stature and attached veneration of the office, besides creating an unfortunate precedent for other provinces/regions, he adds. The letter clarifies that the guidelines for the selection of the rector/vice chancellor were approved by the commission - the governing body for the country's higher education with representation from all provinces - at its 12th meeting held on Feb 24, 2007. \"The said guidelines entail the eligibility criteria for the position of Vice Chancellor/Rector which requires an outstanding academician of international stature having preferably earned a doctorate degree, teaching and research experience publications in HEC-recognised journals, administrative and financial management expertise in reputable institutions, and an age limit of 65 years and emphasise that the appointment be made through an Independent Search Committee,\" the letter says. It also refers to the universities' autonomous status. \"Moreover, Higher Education Institutions are autonomous entities by virtue of their Acts and governed under provisions of acts/statutes/regulations through their statutory authorities and any such appointments of non-academic administrators undermine the academic integrity of the universities.\" Further, the HEC chairman also emphasises the need for sharing any such proposals with the commission. \"It would be appreciated if such proposals are shared with the HEC for a broader consultation in the commission and consensus be reached in the larger interests of the HE sector.\" Classes remain suspended Meanwhile, classes at most public sector universities in the province remained suspended on the second consecutive day on Friday on account of teachers' strike. The strike call for an indefinite period was given by Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (Fapuasa). \"We took this step to highlight the deteriorating state of higher education, governmental apathy, and the severity of challenges faced by universities,\" said president of Fapuasa Dr Ikhtiar Ghumro. He called upon the provincial government to restore universities' autonomous status and withdraw the proposed amendment/s to the Universities Act under which bureaucrats/non-academicians can head universities. \"The government must stop contractual hiring and address financial crises on campuses,\" he said, adding that shortages of resources were adversely affecting the quality of education.
