    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: Fawad Chaudhry, who was information minister in the previous PTI government, has claimed that PML-N and PPP were both enjoying power because of the differences between the PTI and military establishment. \"The day these differences are removed, PTI will get access to the power corridors because military establishment realises that PTI is the most popular political party of Pakistan, and it clearly emerged to be so during the elections held on Feb 8 last year,\" he said while talking to Dawn. Mr Chaudhry, who met PTI's founding chairman Imran Khan in the Adiala jail a few days ago, said Shehbaz Sharif became premier, Asif Zardari got the office of president and Maryam Nawaz became chief minister of Punjab just because PTI was having sour relations with the establishment. \"However because of this situation, Pakistan, army and the state have suffered a lot. I appreciate the current efforts which have been initiated to bridge the gap between the PTI and military establishment,\" he said. When asked if he had played any role in dialogue with the establishment, he said leaders like Asad Qaiser and Ali Amin Gandapur can play a better role in bridging the gap between the PTI and establishment. In reply to a question about his current status in the PTI, Mr Chaudhry claimed he could have become a minister by joining the Istehkam-i-Pakistan Party but he did not go for it. \"Khan Sahib advised me not to respond to those within the PTI who have been talking against me. The day Khan Sahib came out of the jail, he will himself clear my position,\" he claimed. Published in Dawn, January 18th, 2025",
