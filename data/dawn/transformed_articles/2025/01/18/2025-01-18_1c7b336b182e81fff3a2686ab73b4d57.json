As per police and college sources, two college students, Munib and Shahid were harassed by a senior student, Abrar Fityana, from Tandlianwala, Faisalabad, who leads a gang of students. The sources said that Abrar and his fellows would carry arms on the college premises, harass other students to force them to join the gang. On Friday, Abrar and his six unidentified accomplices began harassing Shahid and Munib, who had just finished their classes and were leaving the college. Following a verbal altercation between Munib, Shahid, and Abrar, the latter, along with his accomplices, attacked the two friends. During the scuffle, Abrar allegedly pulled out a dagger and stabbed Munib in the belly, leaving him unconscious. On being called, a Rescue 1122 team reached the spot and transported Munib to the Sahiwal Teaching Hospital, where doctors declared his condition critical. Meanwhile, Abrar and his accomplices fled the scene. The city police have registered a case against six suspects under sections 324, 148 and 149 of the PPC on the complaint filed by the victim's father, Muhammad Anwar.
