    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik on Tuesday emphasised the urgent need for proactive disaster management strategies and highlighted the importance of social resilience. He was speaking at a two-day consultation event, titled \"Transforming Communities through Women and Girls\" Leadership for Climate Resilience and Gender Equality' organised by the NDMA in partnership with the Gender Task Force (GTF) and various UN agencies. The event aimed to underscore the significant contributions of women and girls in driving change, particularly in the realms of climate resilience and disaster management. Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik acknowledged that climate-related disasters disproportionately affect vulnerable groups, especially women and girls, yet these communities hold the potential to contribute significantly to resilience-building. He called for inclusive frameworks that integrate their involvement in formal disaster risk reduction (DRR) and anticipatory action plans. Senator Samina Mumtaz Zehri, in her address, stressed the importance of incorporating gender considerations into climate change strategies. She pointed out that, in the face of escalating climate challenges, empowering women and girls to take leadership roles was not just an opportunity, but an essential component of sustainable resilience. United Nations Resident Coordinator in Pakistan Mohamed Yahya shared insights on locally adaptable solutions to advance women's leadership and innovation in building climate resilience. Fareeha Ummar, Portfolio Manager for Women Empowerment at UN Women, emphasised the value of cross-sector partnerships in addressing gender gaps in climate resilience policies and practices. She stressed that collaboration was key to bridging these gaps and ensuring women's full participation in shaping climate strategies. The consultation also featured panel discussions on the role of women-led organisations (WLOs) in crisis management, recovery and post-recovery efforts. Panelists included key figures from UNDP, UN Women, the Aga Khan Foundation, Islamic Relief Pakistan and VSO, who shared their expertise on gender financing and the coordination of resources in disaster response. The seminar will continue on Wednesday, with further discussions led by gender researchers and academics, continuing to explore ways to empower women and girls in the fight for climate resilience and gender equality.
