    "article_body": "LAHORE: The Punjab police investigation department is all set to field 1,450 specially trained officers to run the Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units (SSOIUs) across the province in alignment with the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act. These dedicated units were established in Punjab under section 9 of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021 following the longstanding complaints of defective investigations into the rape and other sexual crime cases. The establishment of SSOIUs was mandatory under the law, as section 9 confers special jurisdiction to these units to probe scheduled offences. \"Section 9 of the Anti-Rape Act envisages the creation of a special investigation unit in every district by the provincial and federal governments,\" says a senior police officer. As many as 1,450 trained investigators to run units having one policewoman member each Talking to Dawn here on Tuesday, he said, the units shall comprise police officers who received training in investigation into sexual offences. As per the requirement, every SSOIU would have one female police officer as a member of the newly-created unit. The appointment of the female officer would not only help provide legal assistance and other support to the victims but also increase conviction rate in sexual crimes. Following the situation, the Punjab police facilitated training sessions for the SSOIUs, emphasising the investigation into sexual offences, including transgender offenders and victims of rape. The sessions also included an in-depth analysis of case studies to enhance understanding. On Tuesday, Additional IG Investigation Punjab Azhar Akram issued directions for the implementation of the Act across the province in letter and spirit. Addressing the officers through a video link meeting held at the Central Police Office here on Tuesday, Mr Akram directed that all investigation officers be promptly enrolled in information technology-related courses. Punjab Legal DIG Awais Ahmad Malik, all the city police officers, district police officers and other relevant officers attended the meeting. Mr Akram instructed that investigations into scheduled crimes under Section 9 of the Act should be conducted by the SSOIU unit. He told the meeting that 1,450 officers have been specially trained for investigations under the Anti-Rape Investigation and Trial Act. He also said that if a complainant or accused is unsatisfied with the investigation, the SSP or SP should personally handle the case. He instructed that in cases requiring a change of investigation, senior-ranking officers should be assigned. Azhar Akram highlighted that judicial matters under Section 9 and Standing Order 1/24 of the Anti-Rape Investigation and Trial Act can be efficiently managed. He added that cases involving female complainants or accused should be investigated by female police officers and that all cases under the 2021 Act should only be assigned to trained investigation officers.
