    "article_body": "QUETTA: The ambassadors of various countries to Pakistan, in a meeting with the officials of the Balochistan Board of Investment and Trade (BBoIT), discussed trade, investment opportunities in the province, cultural exchange programmes and objectives of the two-day Balochistan Business Summit planned for the last week of January. The diplomats of 16 friendly countries were gathered at an exclusive dinner hosted by BBoIT vice chairman Bilal Khan Kakar, on Monday evening. They belong to Turkiye, Morocco, Norway, Mauritius, Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan, Ethiopia, Malaysia, Portugal, Jordan, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kenya, Romania, Russia and Italy. The BBoIT officials said that board's chief executive officer, Abdul Kabeer Khan Zarkoon, briefed the diplomats, who expressed keen interest in investment opportunities across Balochistan in various sectors. Mr Kakar highlighted that Balochistan is rich in natural resources and serves as a key trade hub in the region. Owing to its geographical significance, the province offers trade routes through Gwadar port to Central Asia, Gulf countries, the Middle East, and Europe. \"The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a living testament to this purpose,\" he said and emphasised that Balochistan is a land of opportunities for investors, boasting some of the world's largest mineral reserves, including copper, gold, lead, zinc, iron, and chromite. \"Areas like Reko Diq and Saindak have already garnered global attention due to their substantial production of valuable minerals, while countless untapped sites remain to be explored, offering unparalleled opportunities for discovery and investment,\" Mr Kakar informed the diplomats. He noted that lucrative investment potential also existed in agriculture, energy, fisheries, and livestock sectors. He assured the ambassadors that foreign companies investing in Balochistan would receive full support and protection from the provincial government. Published in Dawn, January 15th, 2025",
