    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: The Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) has alleged that Capital Development Authority's (CDA) staff is interfering in restoration work at the site of demolished restaurants in Margalla Hills National Park. The CDA, however, claimed that the civic agency never opposed the restoration of the site and that it only stopped the IWMB from constructing walls. IWMB Chairperson Rina Saeed Khan, through an official letter dated December 31, addressed to Chairman CDA, highlighted \"serious concerns regarding interference of the field staff of the CDA in the ongoing restoration work at the site of demolished Monal and La Montana restaurants.\" She said that on December 31, the CDA staff visited the site and ordered IWMB staff to stop the restoration work. Wildlife board accuses civic body of interference; CDA claims board constructing walls in guise of restoration The IWMB chairperson said that the Saidpur and Nurpur range officers and forest guards visited the site and introduced themselves as CDA staff serving under the command of Deputy Director General Environment Irfan Niazi, and ordered the board to stop ongoing restoration work. \"They instructed IWMB staff to stop their work while they were busy planting trees at the site. Our staff informed them that this work enjoyed the protection of Supreme Court order... Ultimately, to avoid confrontation, the IWMB staff halted their work. When asked for written instruction(s) for the orders...they could not produce any written orders,\" the Chairperson IWMB said. \"Despite their clear directives of the Supreme Court, the field staff of CDA has repeatedly obstructed the efforts of IWMB to carry out necessary restoration work at the site. It is important to clarify that the work being undertaken by IWMB includes restoration and stabilisation for plantation and revegetation. This work is essential to ensure that the site becomes an integral part of the national park, as directed by Supreme Court,\" read the letter. Following the orders of the Supreme Court, the Monal, La Montana, and Gloria Jean eateries were asked to exit Margalla Hills. Monal was set up by the CDA, and it rented out the eatery in 2006 for 15 years. The lease agreement expired in 2021, which led to a dispute on the ownership of land. Subsequently, Monal had started depositing partial payments to both the army and the CDA. However, the claim of the army's Remount, Veterinary and Farms Directorate was rejected by the Islamabad High Court, which directed against commercial activities in the national park. Subsequently, on August 21 this year, the Supreme Court ordered the removal of these restaurants. In its detailed order, the apex court had directed the IWMB to take possession of the restaurants, namely Monal, La Montana, and Gloria Jeans, and obligated the CDA and the police to assist the wildlife board. Interestingly, another restaurant, which is operating in Damn-i-Koh area of the national park area, is continuing to do business. While several other restaurants are operating in national park areas that include two restaurants in Shakarparian and another along Srinagar Highway. The Supreme Court rightly directed an end to commercial activities in the national park after demolishing Monal and other eateries. Though that order was specified for three restaurants, it should be applied to other parts of the national park to protect environment,\" said an official. He said that Islamabad Club and several other buildings are operating in Zone III of Islamabad. When contacted, CDA's environment deputy director general, Irfan Niazi, rejected the claim of the IWMB. \"My team visited the area; we stopped them from the construction of walls only. As far as tree plantation is concerned, we never stopped them; even we are ready to help them with tree plantation,\" he said. He alleged that there are some unconfirmed reports that the IWMB, under the guise of restoration wanted to construct kiosks. \"We will not allow anyone to construct kiosks in Margalla Hills,\" he said, adding that the CDA had evidence and photos that walls were being constructed at the site. The IWMB chairperson, however, clarified that board would not set up any kiosks in Margalla Hills. \"We are focusing only on tree plantation to restore the site of demolished Monal and La Montana,\" she told Dawn.
