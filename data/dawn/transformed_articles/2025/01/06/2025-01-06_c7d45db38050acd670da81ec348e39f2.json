    "article_body": "GILGIT: A protest sit-in against power crisis in Aliabad Hunza continued for the third consecutive day on Sunday with the Karakoram Highway (KKH) remaining blocked. The protest has been launched on the call of Hunza Awami Action Committee and the All Parties Traders Association. The protesters spent Saturday night at their protest camp despite freezing temperature and announced to continue it till the government fulfilled their demand. On Sunday, a protest rally was also held in Ganish village and the participants later joined the sit-in. According to a statement issued by the deputy commissioner Hunza, a meeting was held at his office with representatives of the protesters. The deputy commissioner assured the protesters that the GB government would immediately take measures to improve the electricity supply to Hunza. Govt offers rejected, residents announce to continue protest till resolution of issue For this purpose, a new power transmission line would be laid from Jaglote Guro in Gilgit to central Hunza. This transmission line will provide Hunza 1.5 megawatt of electricity in winters and four to five megawatts in summers. However, the protesters rejected the offer and termed it a fake promise. They said such promises were also made in the past and never implemented. The residents decided to continue the protest for the fulfillment of their genuine demand. Speaking to the protesters, GB assembly member from Hunza Ubaidullah Baig criticised the government for not being serious to tackle public issues. He said the government was keeping the local people deprived of electricity. Awami Workers Party leader Baba Jan said if the government continued to ignore the issue the protest demonstrations would be expanded to other areas. He claimed that over 50,000 people would take to the streets in case the issue was not resolved on a priority basis. One of the protesters said work on power projects in Hunza, including Attabad power project, were being delayed. When contacted, Commissioner Gilgit Division Kamal Khan told Dawn that currently there was shortage of power across GB and Hunza was not an exception. He said power generations in the region depended on hydropower stations which required enough water flow. He said in the winter season when water flow in the channels of powerhouses decreased, power generation also decreased. \"So the power shortage becomes an issue across GB in every winter season,\" he said. The commissioner said many projects were underway to alleviate power crisis in GB. The government has been working on different projects to increase power supply to Hunza. He said government representatives met the protesters to explain the steps. More power supply will be ensured for Hunza very soon. However, he said operation of thermal generators to produce required power shortfall was not a permanent solution. Published in Dawn, January 6th, 2025",
