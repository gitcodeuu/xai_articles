    "article_body": "SWAT: Federal Minister for States and Frontier Regions, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir Affairs Eng Amir Muqam said here on Sunday that restoration of peace in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was vital for the sustainable progress and prosperity of Pakistan. Addressing a function hosted in the honour of Rana Mashood Ahmad Khan, Chairman Prime Minister's Youth Programme, at Malam Jabba here, Mr Muqam said that people of KP had rendered great sacrifices for the country, and that socioeconomic empowerment of its youth was imperative for lasting peace and economic prosperity of the province. He said the country's overall stability and prosperity was linked with peace in KP. Mr Muqam said that terrorism was one of the major challenges confronted by Khyber Pakthunkhwa, and collective efforts were required to wipe out this menace. Peace in KP vital to country's prosperity, says Muqam Eng Muqam insisted that KP people were deceived in the name of the so-called 'change' for the third time by PTI as problems of people had increased significantly due to poor governance, corruption and the use of financial resources for politics of agitation. He said that it would have been better if the share of NFC Award given to KP was used on the people's welfare, strengthening of the Counter-Terrorism Department and police rather than \"launching attacks\" on Islamabad. He insisted that PTI agenda was not welfare of masses rather a person-specific. He claimed that PML-N was the only party that could give tough time to PTI in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Eng Muqam said that Pakistan was making rapid progress under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, who has significantly improved Pakistan's image internationally. \"Foreign investment has started coming to Pakistan, confidence of international monetary institutions restored, stock exchange achieved record progress and price hike decreased considerably due to prudent policies of Shehbaz Sharif government.\" He said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had accorded highest priority to socioeconomic empowerment of youth and, 'Uraan Pakistan' initiative had provided an excellent opportunity to youth to contribute to the country's development progress. Amir Muqam claimed that KP people were eagerly awaiting the visits of PML-N central leadership to the province. He said that whenever difficult situation came on Pakistan the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa stood like a rock for defence of the country. He said that due to sacrifices of the people of Swat, terrorism had been defeated in Malakand division. The federal minister said that he also faced several terror attacks in the past with steadfastness, and always raised voice against terrorism. He said courts would decide the cases of PTI founder Imran Khan. He claimed that in the 2024 general election, PML-N had emerged as the second largest political party in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and that his party enjoyed an important position of the Opposition Leader in KP Assembly. On the occasion, Rana Mashood said that socioeconomic empowerment and provision of dignified jobs to youth was the top priority of the government, and the PM youth skills development programme would open gates of employment for them not only in the country but also abroad. He said Rs36 billion projects were approved under the prime minister's youth programme with special focus on their vocational, IT and technical education. He said the students of all provinces of Pakistan would be largely facilitated under this landmark initiative. \"After necessary education and IT training, these youth would be sent abroad for dignified jobs.\" Published in Dawn, January 6th, 2025",
