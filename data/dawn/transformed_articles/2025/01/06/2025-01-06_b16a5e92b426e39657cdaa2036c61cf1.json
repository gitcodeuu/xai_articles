    "article_body": "DERA MURAD JAMALI: The provincial emir of Jamaat-i-Islami Balochistan, Maulana Hidayatur Rehman, has criticised the country's rulers for perpetuating disappointment and backwardness in Balochistan, alleging that they have usurped the province's resources and exacerbated unemployment. Speaking at a public meeting organised by JI Nasirabad in Dera Murad Jamali on Sunday, Maulana Hidayat accused the federal government of exploiting Balochistan's resources, including Reko Diq and Gwadar Port, while depriving locals of their livelihoods by restricting border trade with Iran. \"People of the province are even deprived of basic facilities like education and health facilities,\" he said, adding that the voice of the people was being gagged whenever they spoke about their rights. Maulana Hidayat criticised the exclusion of major development projects in Balochistan under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), alleging that most initiatives were concentrated in Punjab and Sindh. He urged people to support Jamaat-i-Islami and Haq Do Tehreek in their efforts to secure the rights of Balochistan's citizens. He also criticised the abolishment of the Levies and called for the force to be modernised and equipped to combat terrorism effectively. \"Levies are a traditional force familiar with tribal customs and traditions,\" he said, adding that the government should abolish Frontier Corps (FC) checkpoints instead. Addressing local issues in Nasirabad, Maulana Hidayat called for the implementation of a 12-point agenda to address regional grievances. He warned that failure to act would result in a mass sit-in in Quetta, with over 100,000 participants expected. Published in Dawn, January 6th, 2025",
