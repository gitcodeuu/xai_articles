A ceremony was held at the Khaliqdina Hall, where Karachi Mayor Murtaza Wahab presented the Tamgha-i-Karachi awards to the families of seven martyrs and five distinguished individuals who had dedicated themselves to the betterment of the city. Those who were awarded included intellectual Prof Jamal Naqvi, artist and art educator Durriya Kazi, social activist Fatima Majid, author Saima Saleem and martyred officials of fire department - Khalid Shehzad, Rashid Naeem, Naveed Iqbal, Muhammad Abid, Muhammad Afzal, Muhammad Sohail and Muhammad Mohsin. Addressing the ceremony, the mayor informed the audience that the decision to honour the personalities and martyrs who served Karachi was made by the City Council, and it was the first event organised by the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation. Families of seven martyred firefighters are among recipients of the award \"This event would be held every year on January 5 to acknowledge the contributions of those who have played a role in making this city greater,\" he said.
