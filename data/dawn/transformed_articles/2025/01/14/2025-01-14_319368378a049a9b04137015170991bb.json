    "article_body": "SOUTH WAZIRISTAN: The raging forest fire in Wana Kot Konr mountain of Lower South Waziristan, which gutted precious trees and plants, was finally brought under control on Monday. Rescue 1122 officials said a firefighters' team and fire tenders worked tirelessly for two days to contain the blaze. They said teams from rescue and forest departments participated in the operation. The cause of the fire remains unknown, but its impact was devastating. Precious trees of chestnut and Goor Gorey (blackcurrant) were destroyed in the blaze, which left a trail of destruction in its wake. Rescue officials said despite challenges, the teams completed the operation in extremely difficult conditions, battling darkness, cold and rugged terrain. Their efforts finally paid off as the fire was brought under control on Monday. The forest fire had broken out on Saturday, engulfing hundreds of valuable chestnut and blackcurrant trees.
