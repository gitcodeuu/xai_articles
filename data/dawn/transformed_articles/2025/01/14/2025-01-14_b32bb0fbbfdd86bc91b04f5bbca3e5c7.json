    "article_body": "DOHA: Mediator Qatar gave Israel and Hamas a final draft of a deal to end the war in Gaza on Monday, after a midnight \"breakthrough\" in talks attended by US President-elect Donald Trump's envoy, an official briefed on the negotiations said. The official said the text for a ceasefire and the release of hostages was hammered out at talks in Doha which included the chiefs of Israel's Mossad and Shin Bet spy agencies and Qatar's prime minister as well Steve Witkoff, who will become US envoy when Trump takes office next week. Officials from the outgoing US administration are also thought to have participated. \"The next 24 hours will be pivotal to reaching the deal,\" the official said. Israel's Kan radio, citing an Israeli official, reported on Monday that Israeli and Hamas delegations in Qatar had received a draft and that the Israeli delegation had briefed Israel's leaders. Israel, Hamas and the foreign ministry of Qatar did not respond to requests for confirmation or comment. Norway to host 3rd meeting of Global Alliance seeking two-state solution Officials on both sides, while stopping short of confirming that a final draft had been reached, described progress at the talks. A senior Israeli official said a deal could be sealed within a few days if Hamas replies to a proposal. A Palestinian official close to the talks said information from Doha was \"very promising\", adding: \"Gaps were being narrowed and there is a big push toward an agreement if all goes well to the end.\" The United States, Qatar and Egypt have worked for more than a year on talks to end the war in Gaza. De facto deadline Trump's Jan 20 inauguration is now widely seen in the region as a de facto deadline. The US president-elect has said there would be \"hell to pay\" unless hostages held by Hamas are freed before he takes office, while outgoing President Joe Biden has also pushed hard for a deal before he leaves. The official said talks went until the early hours of Monday, with Witkoff pushing the Israeli delegation in Doha and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani pushing Hamas officials to finalise an agreement. The head of Egypt's general intelligence agency Hassan Mahmoud Rashad was also in the Qatari capital as part of the talks, the official said. Trump envoy Witkoff has travelled to Qatar and Israel several times since late November. He was in Doha on Friday and travelled to Israel to meet Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday before returning to Doha. Biden also spoke on Sunday by phone with Netanyahu, stressing \"the immediate need for a ceasefire in Gaza and return of the hostages with a surge in humanitarian aid enabled by a stoppage in the fighting under the deal\", the White House said. Two-state solution In a related development, dozens of countries will send delegates to Norway on Wednesday as part of a global alliance aiming to find a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Norway's foreign ministry said on Monday. Palestinian Prime Minister Mohammed Mustafa, the head of the UN's Palestinian refugee agency UNRWA Philippe Lazzarini, and UN envoy to the Middle East Tor Wennesland are among those due to attend. It will be the third meeting of the Global Alliance for the Implementation of the Two-State Solution, whose creation was announced in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. \"While we must continue to work for an end to the war (in Gaza), we must also work for a lasting solution to the conflict that guarantees self-determination, security and justice for both the Palestinians and the Israelis,\" Norway's Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said in a statement. Representatives of more than 80 countries and organisations are expected to take part in the meeting, though no official Israeli delegation has been announced. Israel was angered when several countries - including Norway - decided to recognise the Palestinian state. Published in Dawn, January 14th, 2025",
