    "article_body": "SWABI: A man allegedly killed his wife for honour and later died by suicide in Chota Lahor tehsil here on Monday. Police and Rescue 1122 officials said that the incident took place in Jalsai Dhok area. Chota Lahor city SHO Gohar Khan said that the accused shot dead his wife from a close range inside a room of his house, and later also shot himself dead. Sajjad Khan, a brother-in-law of the deceased woman, reported to the police that he was with his family at his house when at 3am his nephew knocked at the door to their room, saying his father opened fire on his mother, and later got himself injured with a pistol. Sajjad said when they went there, his 26-year-old sister-in-law was lying in a pool of blood and his brother was injured, while a pistol was also lying with him. He said his injured brother was taken to Bacha Khan Teaching Hospital, Shahmansoor, where he later succumbed to his injuries. Sajjad said his brother was angry that his wife had gone to her parents' house without his permission, which created a gulf between the couple. The police have registered an FIR and started investigation. Published in Dawn, January 14th, 2025",
