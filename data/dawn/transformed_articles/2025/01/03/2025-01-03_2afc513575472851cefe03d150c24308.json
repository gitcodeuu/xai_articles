According to police sources, a third labourer was found unconscious in the room and was shifted to the hospital where his condition was stated to be critical. Muhammad Fiaz and Ghulam Shabir, who belonged to Kot Addu, had been working at an under-construction house when they slept on Wednesday night after putting a coal stove on. The three labourers were found fainting on Thursday morning. Sources said when their colleagues opened the door, they found the room filled with poisonous gas. Published in Dawn, January 3rd, 2025",
