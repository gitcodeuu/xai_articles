    "article_body": "KOHAT: People from various areas locked the main entrance to the Rawalpindi Road grid station here on Friday night to protest prolonged power cuts. The protesters marched on the grid station after staging a demonstration and locked its entrance to protest loadshedding. The protesters were led by former district nazim Naseem Afridi. Later, Peshawar Electric Supply Company officials accompanied by assistant commissioner Nisar Ahmed Khan and SP Farooq Zaman reached the spot and held talks with the protesters. The protesters said they faced difficulties as long power cuts created water shortage. Later, an agreement was reached between the officials and the protesters that a mutually agreed timing would be decided for loadshedding. Meanwhile, superintendent of Kohat jail Abdul Bari said that the prison was supplied electricity for only seven hours during the past 56 hours, which had multiplied miseries of the inmates, including women and children.
