    "article_body": "LAHORE: Punjab Governor Sardar Saleem Haider ordered dismissal of 228 teachers and other employees appointed or promoted at the University of Agriculture Faisalabad (UAF) by its former vice chancellor during the last month of his four-year tenure. The chancellor cited lack of advertisements of posts and qualification issues as reasons for dismissal of the employees. Reports alleged former VC Prof Iqrar Ahmad held five syndicate meetings in a row to approve these appointments weeks before his retirement. According to the order passed by the governor, there were 103 fresh and 125 old cases of promotions of different cadres, including professors, assistant professors, lecturers, deputy registrars, deputy controllers etc. The appointments included the officers from BPS-17 to 21 Former VC had appointed, promoted employees during the last days of his four-year tenure The governor used his power to dismiss the employees under the Section 11-A of the Act of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad, 1973. \"The chancellor may, of his own motion or otherwise, call for and examine the record of any proceedings in which an order has been passed by any authority for the purpose of satisfying himself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding or order and may pass such orders as he may deem fit,\" states the Act. It further states that no order under this section shall be passed unless the person to be affected thereby is afforded an opportunity of being heard. The appointments were made by former VC Prof Iqrar Ahmad from Aug 16, 2024 to Oct 11. His four-year tenure ended on Oct 19, 2024. The employees who were dismissed from the posts organised the protest outside the main gate of the university. They stated that the governor did not call them to hear their stance on the appointments and promotions and dismissed them at the stroke of a pen. They said that it was mandatory under the Act of the university that they should be given a hearing about the appointments. UAF spokesperson Dr Tayyab told Dawn the employees were filing an appeal against the decision to the chancellor on Monday and they were optimistic that they would be given a chance of hearing. He claimed that the former VC did not violate the Act of the university and conducted the promotion and selection boards under his tenure and no one had raised questions about the postings. However, replying to a query about holding selection board and Syndicate meetings in the last days of tenure of Prof Ahmad as the VC, he said it was routine matter and the previous VCs also held selection board and syndicate meetings during last days of their tenures. Replying to another question about not holding the selection board and Syndicate meetings during the first three years of the tenure of the former VC Mr Ahmad until he neared retirement, Dr Tayyab said the university was waiting for foreign evaluation reports of the faculty members which it took time and caused a delay in holding selection board and Syndicate meetings. He said the university had started holding board and Syndicate meetings after receiving foreign evaluation reports of the employees. Published in Dawn, January 5th, 2025",
