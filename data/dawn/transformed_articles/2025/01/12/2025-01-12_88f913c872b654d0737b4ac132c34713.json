    "article_body": "US President-elect Donald Trump accused California officials on Sunday of incompetence over their handling of deadly wildfires raging around Los Angeles. \"The fires are still raging in LA. The incompetent pols (politicians) have no idea how to put them out,\" Trump said on his Truth Social platform. \"This is one of the worst catastrophes in the history of our Country. They just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?\" he wrote. The speed and intensity of the blazes ravaging Los Angeles have tested its firefighting infrastructure and given rise to questions and criticism about the state's preparedness. Hydrants ran dry in the Pacific Palisades neighbourhood as it was ravaged by one of the region's five separate fires, while water shortages additionally hampered efforts elsewhere. With just over a week before he returns to the White House, Trump has launched a series of evidence-free broadsides accusing California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom of failings in response to the blazes. Newsom has meanwhile invited Trump to visit Los Angeles and survey the devastation with him. The fires have so far killed at least 16 people, displaced 150,000 more, and destroyed more than 12,000 structures according to state officials . \"Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place,\" Trump said in his post. Despite firefighters' heroic efforts, including precision sorties from aerial crews, the Palisades Fire has continued to push east towards the priceless collections of the Getty Center art museum and north to the densely populated San Fernando Valley.",
