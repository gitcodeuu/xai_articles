    "article_body": "LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) cyber crime wing has expanded scope of the probe against those involved in editing and spreading doctored images/videos of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz and United Arab Emirates (UAE) President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan on social media and formed a Joint Investigation Team (JIT). The FIA Lahore on Saturday arrested five persons from different areas of Punjab for allegedly uploading fake images/videos of the foreign dignitary and CM Punjab and also making objectionable comments and booked them under PECA. The JIT comprises the deputy directors from Faisalabad, Gujranwala, Multan and Lahore. The JIT will be headed by FIA Lahore Additional Director Chaudhry Sarfraz. The FIA scrutinised a number of suspected accounts on social media and registered cases against five culprits. According to the FIA, preliminary findings showed that 20 social media accounts were involved in uploading the manipulated images and videos of the UAE president and the Punjab CM. The identified accounts were reportedly used to spread false visuals and create a negative impression among social media users. More arrests are expected in coming days, the FIA said. The UAE president had arrived at the Rahim Yar Khan Airport on Sunday last, where Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif welcomed him. Maryam Nawaz was also present there and greeted the visiting dignitary with a handshake. However, Ms Nawaz faced criticism from some quarters that termed her handshake with the UAE president inappropriate. Later, AI-generated videos and pictures of her interaction with the UAE president were also widely circulated online. CM Maryam reportedly was annoyed over this social media campaign against her and directed the authorities concerned for strict action against those involved in it. Subsequently, the FIA cyber crime wing, Lahore, became complainant in this matter and launched the inquiry. Published in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
