    "article_body": "GUJRAT: Families and children of dozens of missing people from the June 2023 Libyan Coast boat capsize tragedy staged a protest after receiving phone calls from alleged human traffickers in Libya, demanding additional money. The demonstrators from Gujrat, Gujranwala, Mandi Bahauddin, Sheikhupura and Bhimber district of Azad Kashmir gathered at Kutchery Chowk. Their rally culminated at Gujrat Press Club, carrying banners and placards demanding that the government take immediate action for the recovery of their loved ones, dead or alive. The families claimed at least 75 Pakistanis were among those missing in the 2023 tragedy. They chanted slogans against human traffickers and criticised the authorities for failing to meet their expectations. Protesters alleged that hundreds of people were stranded in safe houses controlled by international human trafficking mafias in Libya. Several protesters shared distressing accounts of receiving phone calls from numbers previously used by their missing relatives. The callers, allegedly traffickers, demanded additional ransom for either returning the bodies of the deceased or arranging phone conversations with the missing individuals. Despite sharing this information with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), no action has been taken, they said. One protester emphasised that beyond the 75 missing Pakistanis from the 2023 tragedy, hundreds have been detained by traffickers for years. The captors reportedly demand large sums for their release, exacerbating the families' suffering. The protesters urged Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif to intervene for the safe recovery of those held captive in Libya's safe houses and to ensure the return of the deceased victims' bodies. Gujrat and Gujranwala FIA circles have registered dozens of cases against human traffickers linked to the incident, claiming to have arrested several suspects in crackdowns. However, the victims' families expressed dissatisfaction with the progress and demanded stricter actions to ensure the recovery of the missing persons. Published in Dawn, January 12th, 2025",
