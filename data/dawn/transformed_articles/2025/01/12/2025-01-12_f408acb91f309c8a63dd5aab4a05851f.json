    "article_body": "KHUZDAR: Fifteen personnel of the Levies Force in the Khuzdar district of Balochistan have been dismissed from service for failing to resist terrorists and surrendering their weapons. On Jan 8, 80 militants riding motorcycles and vehicles entered the Zehri Tehsil of Khuzdar and caused damage to several government buildings, including the Levies station, Nadra office, and municipal committee. They also took some Levies personnel hostage, seized their weapons, government vehicles and escaped. The Balochistan government took notice of the local administration's delayed response and ordered an investigation. However, before the investigation was completed, Khuzdar Deputy Commissioner Yasir Iqbal Dashti dismissed the 15 Levies personnel, stating that no inquiry was needed due to their negligence in duty. A notification issued by the Khuzdar deputy commissioner on Saturday stated that the Levies personnel showed cowardice and surrendered during an attack by terrorists.
