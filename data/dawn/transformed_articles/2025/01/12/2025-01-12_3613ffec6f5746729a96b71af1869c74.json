    "article_body": "Firefighters were slowly making progress in their battle to contain the inferno that has burned wide areas of Los Angeles' Pacific Palisades neighbourhood to the ground, but spreading flames and strong winds still threatened communities in the populous San Fernando Valley on Sunday. Aircraft dropped water and fire retardant on steep hills to stem the eastward spread of the Palisades Fire and KTLA television reported that ground crews had managed to save a number of houses, although others were lost. \"LA County had another night of unimaginable terror and heartbreak,\" Los Angeles County Supervisor Lindsey Horvath said. Six simultaneous blazes that have ripped across the second-largest US city since Tuesday had killed at least 14 people as of Sunday morning. At least 16 people are estimated to be missing. California Governor Gavin Newsom said he expected the death toll to rise. \"I've got search and rescue teams out. We've got cadaver dogs out and there's likely to be a lot more,\" he told NBC's 'Meet the Press' programme. Newsom said the fires are likely to be the worst natural disaster in US history \"in terms of just the costs associated with it.\" Active duty military personnel are ready to support the firefighting effort, Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) Administrator Deanne Criswell said in a series of Sunday television interviews, adding the agency has urged residents to begin filing for disaster relief. \"We have the funding to support this response, to support this recovery,\" she told ABC's 'This Week' programme. The blazes have damaged or destroyed 12,000 structures, fire officials said. The flames have reduced whole neighbourhoods to smouldering ruins, destroying the homes of the rich and famous and ordinary folk alike and leaving an apocalyptic landscape. Over the past 24 hours, the Palisades Fire spread over an additional 1,000 acres, consuming more homes, officials reported. California Fire official Todd Hopkins said that while 11 per cent of the Palisades Fire was now contained, it has burned more than 22,000 acres. Hopkins told a press conference that fire had spread into the Mandeville Canyon and threatened to jump into Brentwood, an upscale neighbourhood that is home to many celebrities, and the San Fernando Valley. It also inched toward the north-south 405 freeway. Although the Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames had calmed some over the weekend, the National Weather Service (NWS) warned that stronger gusts of up to 110 kilometres per hour could return early next week. Local officials said they expect the strongest winds to occur on Tuesday. Red Flag warnings remain in effect for LA and Ventura counties through Wednesday, the NWS said. \"These winds, combined with dry air and dry vegetation, will keep the fire weather threat in the area,\" it said. Conditions were expected to moderate by Thursday. Some residents were allowed to return to the sites of their ruined homes on Saturday to see what they could salvage. Teams with the LA County Sheriff's Department were working to sift through the rubble with dogs to search for human remains. Evacuation orders throughout the Los Angeles area now cover 153,000 residents. Another 166,000 residents have been warned that they may have to evacuate, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. US President Joe Biden spoke by phone with officials to get an update on their efforts and was briefed by aides on federal resources that were being dispatched. His declaration of a major disaster unlocked federal assistance for those affected by the wildfires, clearing the way for Fema to provide support. \"Fema is now starting to support, with the major disaster declaration, the individuals that have been impacted,\" Criswell said on Fox News on Sunday, urging people to register for assistance through the website DisasterAssistance.gov. Support can range from funding for home repairs to money to replace lost food or medication, Fema spokesperson Michael Hart said, adding that assistance can be provided within days. Newsom also signed an executive order to reduce the amount of state government red tape needed to rebuild lost homes and businesses. However, President-elect Trump criticised local and state officials he believed had handled the situation badly. \"The fires are still raging in LA. The incompetent pols have no idea how to put them out. Thousands of magnificent houses are gone, and many more will soon be lost. There is death all over the place ... they just can't put out the fires. What's wrong with them?\" he said on his Truth Social media feed. Los Angeles Board of Supervisors Chair Kathryn Barger told reporters she invited Trump - who takes office on January 20 - to visit the county to get a first-hand look at the destruction. In Altadena, official Don Fregulia said managing the Eaton Fire and its impact will be a \"huge, Herculean task\" that he said will take \"many weeks of work.\" The Cal Fire website reported that the Eaton Fire was 27pc contained, up from 15pc on Saturday, after burning 14,117 acres. The two big fires combined have consumed more than 36,000 acres, or 145 square kilometres - two-and-a-half times the land area of Manhattan - in one of the worst disasters in Los Angeles history. Officials have declared a public health emergency due to the thick, toxic smoke and poor air quality, as the fires lofted traces of metals, plastics and other synthetic materials. Progress was reported in bringing electrical power back to Los Angeles neighbourhoods. Southern California Edison CEO Steven Powell said there were now about 50,000 customers without power, down from more than half a million days earlier. Private forecaster AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic loss at $135 billion to $150bn, portending soaring homeowners' insurance costs. Pope Francis in his weekly address to the faithful in St Peter's Square said: \"I am close to the people of Los Angeles ... where devastating fires have broken out in recent days. I pray for all of you.\"",
