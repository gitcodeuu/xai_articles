    "article_body": "The death toll from recent flash floods in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa surged to 332 on Saturday as various districts, especially hard-hit Buner, reported more loss of lives, the Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) said on Saturday. This adds to the casualties in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, where the unprecedented floods have claimed at least 12 and nine lives, respectively, besides causing widespread destruction. KP witnessed devastating scenes yesterday as flash floods caused by heavy rainfall and cloudbursts in multiple districts claimed over 200 lives in a day, including five crew members of a provincial government chopper that crashed in Mohmand during relief and rescue efforts. Buner was the worst-affected district in the province with 208 lives lost in the past 48 hours, according to a PDMA situation report. It added that 120 people were injured, while Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum Khan's office reported that 50 were still missing. According to a PDMA report seen by Dawn.com earlier today, Shangla reported 37 deaths, Mansehra 23, Swat 22, Bajaur 21, Battagram 15, Lower Dir five and a child drowned in Abbottabad. Detailing infrastructure damage, the report said 11 houses were destroyed while 63 were partially damaged due to the floods. Two schools in Swat and another in Shangla were also affected. The KP government declared an emergency in the severely affected districts of Buner, Bajaur, Swat, Shangla, Mansehra, Torghar, Upper and Lower Dir and Battagram. According to a notification available with Dawn.com, the state of emergency will remain in place until August 31 and local administrations in these districts have been authorised to mobilise all resources for relief activities. \"The Provincial Disaster Management Authority shall provide from its central storage ... a reasonable quantity of tents and NFIs (non-food items), and/or any other article available if required for the subject purpose,\" the notification read. The KP government released Rs1 billion in funds to the PDMA for \"timely compensation/preparedness and response to cope with any untoward situation\", a notification shared by it on X said. It also allocated over Rs1.55bn worth of funds for its Communication and Works Department for the restoration of highways and bridges in the flood-affected districts. Additionally, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) said it was closely monitoring the situation in flood-affected areas, noting that flash floods damaged several cellular and fixed-line sites, causing service disruptions. \"PTA teams are on the ground, coordinating with federal [and] provincial authorities, district administrations and telecom operators for swift restoration,\" the PTA said in a statement. In Buner, the PTA held meetings with Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Amir Muqam, PTI Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan, Buner Deputy Commissioner Kashif Qayum and senior officials of PTCL and CMOs (cellular mobile operators) to review recovery efforts. \"PTA, together with operators, is making all-out efforts to restore communication services at the earliest, recognising their vital role in rescue and relief operations,\" the statement added. Additionally, mobile operator Jazz announced in a press release that it would provide free on-net and PTCL calls for all subscribers in KP. \"The Government of Pakistan has also launched the nationwide 911 unified emergency helpline (PEHL), offering citizens free-of-charge access to emergency services across the country,\" the operator added. On the directives of Governor Faisal Karim Kundi, the Pakistan Red Crescent in KP set up an Emergency Relief Centre to assist flood-affected districts. It can be contacted on 0300-5849255 (secretary), 0334-9086169 (admin officer), 091-9333666, or 091-2590846. Meanwhile, state broadcaster PTV News provided a weather advisory on X, warning people of \"a severe risk of floods and landslides on Torghar, Battagram, Shangla, Lower Kohistan, Tatta Pani, Gilgit, Hunza and Swat roads\", discouraging unnecessary travel in these areas. According to the post, GB's Somro Bridge, Ghanche, Saltoro Bridge and Baghicha (Skardu) Bridge were severely damaged and citizens were urged to completely avoid travel. It added that traffic was suspended on the Jaglot-Skardu road, while routes in Ghizer district, Naltar Road, Babusar Top Road and around Hunza were closed, with tourists discouraged from travelling. Meanwhile, the provincial management service (PMS) chairman requested in a letter that the KP finance secretary deduct a day's salary from all PMS officers and redirect the money for relief work, further requesting that the secretary redirect his \"whole salary\". In a statement on X, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said he was \"deeply anguished by the devastation caused by cloudbursts and flash floods in KP and northern Pakistan\". Extending his heartfelt condolences and expressing solidarity, he affirmed: \"The government is mobilising all resources for rescue and relief operations.\" The premier added that he met National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Chairman Lt Gen Inam Haider Malik and directed him to \"expedite rescue operations in the nine affected districts of Swat, Buner, Bajaur, Torghar, Mansehra, Shangla, and Battagram, with urgent focus on Bajaur and Battagram\". \"Immediate relief is being provided to stranded residents, medical aid to the injured, and heavy machinery has been deployed to clear roads and restore connectivity,\" PM Shehbaz said. Buner Police's public relations officer Israr Khan, put the district's death toll at 207, compared to the 204 stated by the PDMA. DC Qayum, in a statement, ordered a ban on the entry of private vehicles into Buner, stating that it was hindering rescue and relief work. PTI's Barrister Gohar, who is an MNA from Buner, and MPA Riaz Khan visited the flood-hit area of Beshonai and met the bereaved families who lost their loved ones in the floods, the KP government said. Later, Gohar chaired a meeting at the Buner DC's office, which was attended by CM Gandapur, the KP chief secretary, provincial ministers and other senior officials. \"Instructions were given to the relevant departments and district administration to expedite the search for missing persons, rehabilitation, and road clearance operations in the affected areas,\" a post on Gohar's X account read. As the nation observed a day of mourning for the five crew members who died in a helicopter crash during rescue efforts, the national flag flew at half-mast at Governor House in Peshawar. CM Gandapur chaired an emergency meeting in Peshawar to review the damage caused by cloudbursts, heavy rains and flash floods across the province, which was attended by the chief secretary, divisional commissioners, deputy commissioners, senior officials and PDMA representatives, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. Officials said rescue operations were largely completed and the focus was now on relief and rehabilitation. The meeting's participants were informed that 309 people were killed and 23 were injured in various rain and flood-related incidents, while 63 houses were partially damaged. Surveys of damage to roads and other infrastructure are still underway. \"Work is being carried out to restore road links to cut-off areas, and medical teams, food, medicines, and essential supplies are being sent to the affected districts,\" the report read. The meeting was informed that the provincial government has released Rs 1.5 billion to the PDMA for rescue, relief, and compensation, while releasing another Rs 1.5bn to the communication and works department for the repair of roads and infrastructure. In addition, Rs500 million was allocated to deputy commissioners to compensate the families of those killed in the flooding. \"The provincial government stands firmly with the people in this difficult time and will use all available resources for their rehabilitation,\" the chief minister said at the meeting. Expressing solidarity with the bereaved families, CM Gandapur praised the provincial and district administrations for their swift response, saying their performance in the crisis had been commendable and urged them to maintain their commitment during the relief and rehabilitation phase. \"Road connectivity must be restored as quickly as possible, with helicopters used to deliver aid to inaccessible areas,\" the CM ordered. \"Compensation payments must be completed within two days and additional medical staff need to be deployed from neighbouring districts. \"Food supplies must be ensured so that no affected family faces shortages.\" The chief minister also instructed the chief secretary and the PDMA to strengthen monitoring and coordination between federal and provincial agencies, mobilise heavy machinery for reconstruction and immediately dispatch all available food and non-food items to flood-hit districts. Earlier, the CM visited Buner to review the damage caused by flooding and ongoing relief operations, according to a post on X by the KP government. \"The divisional and district administration will brief the chief minister on human and financial losses and relief activities,\" the government wrote. \"The chief minister will also visit the affected areas and meet with the affected families.\" The post added that members of the provincial cabinet, the chief secretary, and other officials would accompany CM Gandapur. While speaking to reporters in the area, the chief minister said that rescue operations have started and the government is working to clear roads blocked by the flooding. \"Routes in some areas have been restored; however, some have not,\" he said. \"We have also requested helicopters. Our goal right now is to restore the routes. \"I want to let people know that the provincial government compensate citizens fully for damages to their homes,\" the chief minister added. \"We are in touch with the NDMA and they will provide us with whatever we need.\" Federal Minister Muqam, visited areas in Buner affected by floods today to assess the damage and meet with victims, the Associated Press of Pakistan reported. The minister, who is also the president of the PML-N in KP, was accompanied by the Malakand commissioner and other senior officials. Muqam stated that he was visiting on the instructions of PM Shehbaz, who is personally overseeing the relief operation. \"This is not the time for politics; the entire nation stands with victims,\" he said. The minister added that the prime minister would also be visiting the affected districts soon, but did not say specifically when. During his visit, Muqam directed officials to expedite relief efforts, which are being supported by the local police and district administration. He met with affected families, offering condolences and reviewing ongoing relief activities. The minister noted that the local administration, the Pakistan Army, and Frontier Corps were all participating in the rescue operation. \"Many villages have been completely destroyed and prayers are being offered for those still missing,\" he said. \"Medical camps have been established in affected areas and the federal government will provide all necessary resources.\" According to the Gilgit-Baltistan Disaster Management Authority (GBDMA), 11 people were killed, 25 were injured and four were reported missing during the past 48 hours. The authority added that 92 houses were partially damaged, while 99 were fully destroyed, citing initial reports. Detailed assessments were still ongoing Interior Minister Shams Lone said that the bridge on the Baltistan Highway was swept away in the flood, cutting off four districts of Baltistan from Gilgit for the second day. He said that since July 22, \"thirty-five people died, 35 were injured and four are missing in the flood waves. Similarly, 318 houses have been completely demolished and 674 have been partially damaged.\" Lone said that the GB government does not have the resources, so the Army has taken steps to help in relief efforts. \"The Pakistan Army played an important role in the rehabilitation after the massive destruction caused by the Babusar flood and provided food and other essential items to the victims of Ghizer today,\" he said. \"The Army has played an important role and is still at the forefront in this difficult phase.\" Later, Rescue Information Officer Shakriz said in a statement that the body of a person previously reported missing had been recovered, bringing the overall death toll in the region to 36. Meanwhile, GB government spokesperson Faizullah Faraq said a \"great number of tourists\" were trapped in the Naltar Valley as the land route was disconnected after floodwaters washed away a huge chunk of the Naltar Expressway. In his statement, the official said the power supply in the area had been suspended as the three power plants situated there were shut down due to the floods. According to Faraq, river waters from the Jaglot Goro stream entered several houses and restaurants in low-lying areas. He added that floods across the province caused severe damage to public property and infrastructure. \"Flooding in four locations in Gilgit district today severely damaged four power plants, a bridge and an expressway, while a large number of buildings were submerged in Jaglot Guru.\" Faraq said that the floods in Naltar Valley damaged three power plants, cutting off power supply to thousands of people. \"A power plant and a bridge were also damaged in Bagrot, cutting off power, while land communication was suspended due to the bridge being washed away,\" Faraq said. \"A flood relay containing heavy stones swept away a house within the limits of Allahwali Lake in Astore in the afternoon,\" he added. \"Local people ran to save their lives.\" The KP PDMA told AFP that around 2,000 rescue workers were engaged in recovering bodies from the debris and carrying out relief operations in nine affected districts. Rescue 1122 Director General Muhammad Tayyab Abdullah told Dawn.com that an elite rescue squad of 80 individuals has been formed for areas where operations are facing \"intense difficulty\". \"In the past 12 hours, 3,542 emergencies have been responded to, while 76 vehicles are taking part in the rescue operations,\" he detailed. DG Abdullah noted that the teams were facing challenges in their activities because of ruined roads, while people were also not able to contact helplines due to damaged mobile towers. Similarly, KP Rescue 1122 spokesperson Bilal Ahmed Faizi told AFP: \"Heavy rainfall, landslides in several areas, and washed-out roads are causing significant challenges in delivering aid, particularly in transporting heavy machinery and ambulances. \"Due to road closures in most areas, rescue workers are travelling on foot to conduct operations in remote regions,\" he highlighted. \"They are trying to evacuate survivors, but very few people are relocating due to the deaths of their relatives or loved ones being trapped in the debris.\" Meanwhile, PTV News reported that Pakistan Army personnel have arrived in Buner as part of relief efforts. The broadcaster said in a post on X that special equipment from the Army Corps of Engineers will be used to recover bodies and those injured trapped underneath layers of mud. \"Rations and other supplies are being provided through Pakistan Army helicopters, and people are being evacuated from flood-hit areas to safe locations,\" PTV News wrote. A statement issued by Buner's Rescue 1122 said DG Abdullah, Buner Operations Director Mir Alam, North Region Operations Director Arshad Iqbal and the district emergency officer were supervising the operation themselves. The Rescue DG urged the public not to go near floodwaters, rainwater drains or bridges, and contact the 1122 helpline in the case of an emergency. In Battagram, two more bodies were recovered at the Malkal Gali-Neel Band village, which had been impacted by a cloudburst on early Thursday, according to Assistant Commissioner Muhammad Saleem Khan. The rescue operations had resumed at 6am after being suspended at 7:30pm yesterday due to nightfall and the challenging terrain. Flash floods also severely impacted the power infrastructure in Swat, as floodwaters entered the 132KV Swat grid station, causing the tripping of 41 feeders and the complete suspension of electric supply across the region. The KP PDMA has said rainfall would continue until August 21 in different parts of the province. The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has also warned the Balochistan government to take emergency measures to prepare for a new spell of monsoon rains in the province, which will start from Aug 18 and continue until Aug 22. Beshonai village in Buner, a settlement of more than 80 households, was left in ruins a day after flash flooding tore through the village centre. According to a Dawn.com correspondent on the ground, a steady stream was calmly running beneath the large stones the flood brought in, and though there are some remaining houses along the bank of the stream, most others were completely washed away, along with their inhabitants. Hakeem Jan, a resident of a nearby village, told Dawn.com that he heard \"loud bursts\" in the mountains, then \"a huge rally of water and big stones colliding and raging downward\". \"Multiple cloudbursts in the upper portion of the Elum valley caught the villagers unguarded, leaving them with no time to escape,\" Jan said. \"The survivors are the children who were at school away from the village or the ones who are on jobs outside Buner.\" One survivor, Gul Bacha, told Dawn.com, \"Most people working in the relief operations are outsiders and there are no confirmed figures on the death toll here. I was upstream when I saw a big wave of black water coming in the direction of our village. \"I ran like crazy and was screaming to the villagers ... some people heard me and ran, but most people downstream were caught unawares.\" Javed Khan, a schoolteacher who lost several relatives, told Dawn.com that while no bodies were recovered in Beshornarry, \"seventy corpses were swept away and recovered in Peer Baba and Dagar, later laid to rest by locals\". Peer Baba Union Council Nazim Abbas Shaheen told Dawn.com that accessibility was a major hurdle. \"It is almost impossible to bring heavy machinery into the affected areas,\" he said. In Qadar Nagar, another valley in the area affected by the floods, a collective funeral for 56 people was offered, where one family lost 40 people. The two survivors among them were a father and his son, who were at Islamabad airport to collect another son who had returned home from abroad. After hitting Beshonai village and Qadar Nagar, the floodwater left behind wrecked houses and destroyed vehicles in its path, affecting major towns and villages. Images taken by a correspondent on the ground showed cars swept away and lodged in buildings, as well as flooded school yards. Additional input from Umaid Ali and AFP.",
