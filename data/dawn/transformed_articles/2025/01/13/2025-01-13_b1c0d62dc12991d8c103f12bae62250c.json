    "article_body": "KARACHI: Families displaced by demolition drives to widen roads along Gujjar and Orangi nullahs staged a demonstration on Sunday in protest over the government failure in implementing a Supreme Court order regarding their resettlement. The protest was organised by the Karachi Bachao Tehreek (KBT) outside the Karachi Press Club, where a large number of affectees, including children, gathered to demand alternative houses as promised by the government before the apex court. Carrying placards inscribed with their demands, the protesters called upon the government to disburse lump sum payment of Rs 6.92 billion - cost of construction of their houses on 80-square-yard plots - in one instalment at the earliest, as the affectees are burdened by rising rent costs, inflation, and delayed resettlement. They reminded the government that they lost their homes, livelihoods, and access to education, while struggling to cover basic necessities and asked the authorities to continue issuing cheques for their rent until lump sum payment. The demonstrators also demanded that the cheque issuance process be streamlined in consultation with them. They said that despite submitting applications twice, the commissioner office had rejected requests to include missing IDs in the rehabilitation process. They demanded a transparent mechanism to ensure all missing IDs are counted and corresponding cheques are issued. One of the protesters, Humaira, urged the government to honour the Supreme Court's promise, highlighting the severe impact on her children's education and her family's livelihood. \"The KBT and the affected residents of Gujjar and Orangi Nullahs will persist in their political and legal struggle until every individual is fairly compensated,\" said a press release issued here.
