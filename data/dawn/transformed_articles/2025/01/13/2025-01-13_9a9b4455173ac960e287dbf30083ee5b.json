    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: Senate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani on Sunday called on Muslim communities as well as the international community to renew their commitments towards empowering girls through education. Addressing the concluding session of the International Conference on Girls' Education in Muslim Communities, the Senate chairman said education was not a privilege but a fundamental right, underscoring the teachings of Islam and the vision of Pakistan's founder Quaid-i-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who strongly advocated for gender equality and the importance of education for all. The conference brought together global leaders, including Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Secretary General Hissein Brahim Taha, Secretary General of the Muslim World League Mohammad bin Abdul Karim Al-Isa and distinguished dignitaries such as Nobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai and former Norwegian prime minister Kjell Magne Bondevik to discuss the challenges and opportunities for girls' education in Muslim communities. Minister acknowledges challenges facing girls' education \"The future of any society lies in the education of its youth, particularly girls. We cannot build a prosperous future if we leave half of our population behind,\" Mr Gilani said. He also paid tributes to the global efforts of Malala Yousafzai, whose advocacy had inspired millions, and reiterated Pakistan's commitment to ensuring that every girl, regardless of background, had access to quality education. Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani also highlighted the contributions of former prime ministers Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto for women's education and their endeavours for bringing gender equality, social empowerment and political participation for women in Pakistan. He stated that history reminded us that educated Muslim women had played a major role in shaping societies. He emphasised that literacy, especially among women, was a cornerstone of a sustainable and prosperous society, and said that educating girls not only transformed individual lives but also uplifted entire communities by improving health outcomes and fostering economic empowerment, building resilience, promoting stability and strengthening social cohesion. The Senate chairman called for advancing the cause of girls' education, emphasising that we must embrace a comprehensive approach that combined collaborative action, resource development, and community engagement. He urged distinguished scholars and policymakers to translate the invaluable insights and lessons of this conference into tangible, impactful strategies that would inspire change. Mr Gilani urged governments, civil society, and international partners to work together to create an environment where girls were encouraged, supported and empowered to pursue their education. Speaking at the conference, Education Minister Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui emphasised the need for collective action to overcome the barriers to girls' education, underscoring the importance of education in empowering women and strengthening communities. Speaking at the closing ceremony of a two-day global conference on 'Girls' Education in Muslim Society: Challenges and Opportunities' on Sunday, Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui reiterated his commitment as education minister to ensure that every child in Pakistan, regardless of gender, socio-economic background or geographical location, had access to quality education. \"Addressing educational disparities remains a top priority for the government as education plays a vital role in empowering girls, in their prosperity, development and well-being,\" the minister said. Expressing concern over the persistent opposition to girls' education, he called on the nation to unite in challenging these entrenched societal norms and attitudes. He stressed that girls' education was not only a moral imperative but also an economic necessity, highlighting that educated girls are better equipped to care for their families and access better job opportunities. Meanwhile, the minister acknowledged the significant challenges facing girls' education, noting that millions of girls were still out of school in Pakistan. Highlighting the significant obstacles girls face in accessing education, he said the government had launched several initiatives aimed at increasing girls' enrolment and improving the overall quality of education nationwide. The federal education minister outlined several key measures aimed at improving the quality of education, including teacher training, construction of new schools and provision of scholarships for female students. He also noted that efforts were underway to enhance school infrastructure, particularly in underserved and rural areas, to ensure better educational opportunities for all students. He stressed the need to create a society where girls have access to quality education that enabled them to reach their full potential. The minister also highlighted the vital role of parents, teachers and community leaders in promoting girls' education, urging that their contributions be recognised. He called for collective action to remove the barriers to girls' education and eliminate the existing inequalities in the education system. Published in Dawn, January 13th, 2025",
