The initiative seeks to raise awareness and provide free screenings for tuberculosis (TB) and Hepatitis B and C. \"The campaign's primary focus is on educating the community about the risks, symptoms and preventive measures associated with these diseases,\" a spokesman for the RDMC said on Sunday. He said that IHHN teams, alongside community health workers, have been conducting interactive sessions on essential medical practices, the importance of Hepatitis B vaccination, and the dangers of unsterilised medical equipment and unsafe blood transfusions. In addition to these educational efforts, he said the campaign has also focused on promoting respiratory hygiene, proper ventilation and adherence to TB treatment regimens to reduce transmission.
