    "article_body": "SAHIWAL: Three labourers died and two were critically injured when a Bahawalpur-bound bus rammed into their tractor-trolley from its rear side due to thick fog in the early hours of Sunday on Burewala Road, tehsil Chichawatni. Reports said five labourers were traveling to Burewala city with construction material loaded on a trolley when the speeding bus hit it. Eyewitness said the accident occurred because of dense fog and speeding. The impact was so severe that the labourers were flung from their trolley onto the road. As a result, two labourers, Zahid (25) and Muhammad Farooq (40), died on the spot while one Ghulam Dastagir (32) succumbed to his injuries on the way to hospital. The bus driver fled after the accident, leaving the injured behind. The two critically injured laborers were transported to THQ Hospital. None of the bus passengers were injured. Later, the family members of the deceased refused to let the authorities conduct an autopsy. Chichawatni Police registered a case against the bus driver and impounded the bus.
