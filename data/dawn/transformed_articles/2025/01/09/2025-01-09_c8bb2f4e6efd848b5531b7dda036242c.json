    "article_body": "KARACHI: An unidentified young woman was killed in an execution-style shooting in Orangi Town, police said on Wednesday. A police statement said that two men brought a young woman to a street near the ZMC park late on Tuesday night on their motorbike. \"They got off the vehicle, shot her twice, and rode away,\" it said. The body was shifted to the Abbasi Shaheed Hospital for a post-mortem examination. She remained unidentified on Wednesday as no one has so far approached the police to claim the body. Police Surgeon Dr Summaiya Syed said the woman, aged between 18 and 20, sustained a single bullet wound in the head. The crime scene unit collected two spent bullet casings fired from a 9mm pistol, the statement added. Mominabad SHO Shahbaz Yusuf told Dawn that CCTV footage obtained from the crime scene was blurred. He said that the victim probably did not have a record with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra), as her fingerprints could not be matched with their database. SSP-Investigation (West) Arib Mahar said that a witness saw the victim and the suspects arguing with each other and later shots being fired. Published in Dawn, January 9th, 2025",
