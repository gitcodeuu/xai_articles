    "article_body": "LAHORE: Following public complaints about the issuance of arms licences and other irregularities, the Punjab home department has shuffled the entire staff in its judicial wing and arms branches, also directing all deputy commissioners (DCs) to change their respective arms branches' staff. A home department letter addressed to the DCs in the province says the department has undergone a comprehensive reorganisation on the instructions of the competent authority. \"This reorganisation involved the replacement of previous staff at all levels with newly-designated personnel to enhance operational efficiency and ensure accountability,\" reads the letter. In continuation, the home department has asked all DCs to review and replace the arms branches' staff in respective district offices. CS reviews drive against encroachments It stressed that the DCs should pay particular attention to the personnel who had been serving in the same position for more than a year, and substitute them to align with the established policy. The home department has also asked the DCs to conduct the reorganisation exercise on an annual basis to ensure the optimal functioning of the arms branches, given their sensitive nature of work. ENCROACHMENTS: The Punjab government has directed all deputy commissioners to accelerate the ongoing operation against encroachments in the province. A meeting chaired by Chief Secretary Zahid Akhtar Zaman on Wednesday reviewed the anti-encroachment operation, price control measures, the Suthra Punjab (sanitation) programme, as well as progress on the key performance indicators (KPIs). Expressing his displeasure over encroachments in the Dinga area, he sought a report from Gujranwala commissioner. The chief secretary asked commissioners, DCs and other relevant staff to permanently assign duties to traffic police and municipal staff in bazaars to check encroachments. He also stressed the administrative officers to take stern action against the government employees involved in corruption to provide relief to the common man. The chief secretary also emphasised ensuring availability of food items, including roti at fixed prices, besides effective measures to stabilise the chicken prices. Administrative secretaries of relevant departments attended the meeting, while all divisional commissioners and DCs participated via video-link. TRANSFER, POSTING: The Punjab government on Wednesday posted Farvah Aamir, awaiting posting in S&GAD, as Khushab DC against a vacant post, while Sargodha DC retired Capt Muhammad Waseem was relieved of the post's additional charge. Khushab Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC)-revenue Muhammad Kamran Afzal was transferred and directed to report to the S&GAD for further orders. Khanewal ADC-revenue Abdus Sattar Khan was transferred and posted as ADC(R) Khushab. OSD Khalid Abbas was promoted to BS-18 and posted as ADC(R) Khanewal upon promotion.
