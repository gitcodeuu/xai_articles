    "article_body": "LAHORE: The Federal Investigation Agency on Wednesday quizzed Lahore Electric Supply Company (Lesco) chief Shahid Haider for reinstating two officers who were facing different allegations, including corruption, misappropriation and malpractices. The FIA anti-corruption wing questioned Mr Haider for four hours regarding his role in the reinstatement of two SDOs - Usman Ghani and Salman Samoel - who were earlier dismissed on these charges. Sources said Mr Haider submitted his statement to the FIA taking different pleas to justify his action. The FIA expedited the proceedings against the incumbent Lesco chief.
