    "article_body": "BATTAGRAM: Despite government's announcement of winter vacation in the winter zones throughout the province, majority of private schools here remain open. In December, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government announced winter vacation for both summer and winter zones. Initially, a one-week winter vacation was announced for the summer zone and over two months for the winter zone. However, due to harsh weather conditions, the government extended the winter vacation in the summer zone by another week. In Battagram, which is already classified as a winter zone, only public sector institutions are observing the vacation, while private institutions remain open, violating government orders. DC says officials directed to ensure compliance with govt orders The district administration, responsible for enforcing government orders, has turned a blind eye to the issue. Locals have expressed frustration, stating that the government's claims of uniform education policies are hollow, as private sector institutions are not being held accountable. Mohammad Hayat, a resident, told Dawn that the government's machinery was ineffective, and private sector institutions were not being forced to comply with the government orders. \"It is too difficult for us to send our children to school early in the morning in harsh weather.\" Resident Zameer Khan, whose children attend a private school, said that the government's weakness in implementing its orders was evident. He added that his son and a nephew, students of first and second grades, respectively, were suffering from severe cough and cold as they had to attend school in the harsh winter weather. Said Mohammad, another resident, mentioned that the lack of rain had led to a seasonal flu outbreak, affecting children and the elderly. He stated that it was challenging for parents to keep their children warm and send them to school in the early morning hours. Resident Mohammad Anwar claimed that private school owners were prioritising profits over children's health, refusing to observe winter vacation due to the collection of heavy fees from parents. He added that parents were concerned about their children's health but were forced to send them to school to avoid fines and potential expulsion. Locals have demanded that the government ensure the execution of its orders, rather than simply issuing notifications. Syed Raqib Shah, district president of Private Education Network, said that winter camps were being held for 9th and 10th graders, while vacation was being observed for primary and middle school students. When contacted, deputy commissioner Asif Ali Khan told Dawn on phone that he had directed administrative officials to ensure private schools observed winter vacation according to the government's notified schedule. However, he added that some exceptions were made for schools where exams were being held. \"The government has allowed higher grade classes to hold winter camps, with three to four hours of classes daily, and students are permitted to attend in casual dresses.\" Published in Dawn, January 9th, 2025",
