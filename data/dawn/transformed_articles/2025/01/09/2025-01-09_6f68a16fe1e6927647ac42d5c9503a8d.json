    "article_body": "LAHORE: A man was hospitalised in a critical condition after a stray kite string got entangled around his neck, cutting his jugular vein, in the jurisdiction of Defence C police station here on Wednesday. Identified as Sabir Masih (50), the man was reportedly going to market on his motorbike when the incident occurred. He was immediately rushed to the Lahore General Hospital (LGH) by a Rescue 1122 ambulance as he fell unconscious owing to massive bleeding from his wounds. A police official says that Lahore Operations DIG Faisal Kamran inquired after the injured man in hospital after Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz took notice of the incident and issued an order to initiate action against those defying the anti-kite flying regulations. The CM got furious over the violation of the kite-flying ban, and sought a report from Punjab police inspector general on the matter, says a handout. She directed the authorities concerned to provide the best medical treatment to the injured man. LGH Medical Superintendent Dr Faryad Hussain said the kite string had cut the patient's jugular vein, causing massive bleeding and his surgical procedure was a challenging task for the doctors. He said the man was immediately shifted to the operation theatre and the LGH surgeons saved his life by performing complicated surgery. \"Sabir Masih is now out of danger,\" he said.
