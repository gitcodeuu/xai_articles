    "article_body": "PESHAWAR: A student of Islamia College University allegedly died by suicide after his body was recovered from his locked room at the varsity's hostel on Wednesday, campus police said. They said that according to initial investigation, Ziauddin, a resident of Upper Dir and student of the 7th semester of the varsity's law department, had cut a drawstring into two pieces and used it to commit suicide by strangling himself. \"The postmortem report says there is no torture mark on his body,\" Masood, a police official, told Dawn, adding that the student was alone in his room and had locked it from inside. Meanwhile, a suicide note, which went viral on social media and is purportedly written by the student for his father in Pashto titled 'Why I am committing suicide', read: \"Father, I am in a situation which I cannot explain. I am fed up with the world. I am not in love with anyone nor do I have any love affair but I don't want to live anymore. I don't know why but I cannot live in this society.\" Published in Dawn, January 2nd, 2025",
