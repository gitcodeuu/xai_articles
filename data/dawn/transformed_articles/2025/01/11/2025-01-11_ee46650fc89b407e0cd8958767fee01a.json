    "article_body": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A jirga of Mehsud tribal elders on Friday demanded immediate return of the displaced persons to Upper South Waziristan district and a complete halt to military operations in the region. The jirga was held in the Tank district on Friday, with a significant attendance of tribal elders, political and social figures and youth. During the jirga, it was unanimously decided to present five key demands to the Inspector General of Frontier Corps (IGFC) South. A delegation will meet the FC South chief to highlight the issues after receiving an invitation from his office. The jirga members demanded immediate return of displaced residents of Upper South Waziristan to their homes, a complete halt to military operations in the region, an immediate end to mortar shelling in populated areas, an end to deforestation in the area along with the withdrawal of \"baseless\" FIRs against tribal leaders and the immediate release of detained individuals. The jirga stressed the urgent need to protect the rights of the Mehsud tribe and to prioritise the resolution of their issues. The members reaffirmed their commitment to pursuing a peaceful struggle to achieve their objectives. Published in Dawn, January 11th, 2025",
