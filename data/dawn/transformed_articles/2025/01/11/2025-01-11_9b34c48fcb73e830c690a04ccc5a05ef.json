    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has enlisted Awaam Pakistan (AP) party, recognising its intra-party polls held in June last year. The party will be headed by ex-premier Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, while former finance minister Miftah Ismail will be its secretary general. Both leaders previously associated with PML-N had quit the party, which is currently leading the ruling coalition, after developing differences with its leadership. According to a notification placed by the ECP on its website, the party had submitted details of its intra-party elections on June 26, 2024. However, the two leaders did not announce its launch until a month later. Addressing the media, Mr Abbasi had then lamented that politics had become more about self-preservation than serving public interest. Mr Ismail said his party would not follow the 'hereditary politics'. Published in Dawn, January 11th, 2025",
