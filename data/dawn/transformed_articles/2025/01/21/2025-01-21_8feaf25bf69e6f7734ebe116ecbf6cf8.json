Trump portrays himself as 'saved by God' as he announces slew of executive orders: Trump sworn in as 47th president as US braces for a new era of disruption and division - The Guardian British daily The Guardian took a more critical angle with its coverage, opening its piece by writing, \"The United States was launched on a fresh course of disruption and division on Monday as Donald Trump was sworn in as its 47th president.\" The Guardian notef that his speech \"immediately struck a nationalistic tone ... vowing to \"put America first\", while Trump called his election \"a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal and all of these many betrayals that have taken place, and to give the people back their faith, their wealth, their democracy, and indeed, their freedom\". Trump was quoted by The Guardian as saying, \"The journey to reclaim our republic has not been an easy one, that I can tell you. Those who wish to stop our cause have tried to take my freedom and indeed to take my life. I was saved by God to make America great again.\" The Guardian concluded: \"Despite the alternately positive and threatening tone, Trump's language still departed from the loftier rhetoric deployed at inaugurations by some of his predecessors.\" Read more here.

Trump Makes History: First Convicted Felon To Take Oath As President - The Huffington Post On its homepage, The Huffington Post had a header reading \"Carnage part two: Trump sworn in\", while the story itself noted Trump's historic feat of being the first convicted felon elected to the White House. \"Donald Trump made twofold history Monday, becoming the first to take the oath of office despite having tried to end American democracy, as well as becoming the first presidential convicted felon,\" the opening line read. \"In his 30-minute inaugural speech, Trump wasted little time in lashing out at the criminal prosecutions that flowed from his actions that day,\" Huffpost wrote. \"'The vicious, violent and unfair weaponisation of the department and our government will end,' he said just 90 seconds in.\" Huffpost likened the speech to one of those heard at his campaign rallies, as he \"accused the outgoing government of incompetence in basic functions and painted immigrants as 'dangerous criminals'\". The publication noted that had Trump been convicted for the January 6, 2021, Capitol Riots, he could have received \"decades in federal prison\". \"Instead, he is again commander in chief of the United States armed forces and putative leader of the free world,\" Huffpost wrote.
