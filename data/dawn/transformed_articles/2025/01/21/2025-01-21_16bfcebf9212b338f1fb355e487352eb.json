    "article_body": "The Taliban government said on Tuesday it had released two American citizens from prison in return for an Afghan fighter held in the United States, in a deal brokered by Qatar. Discussions about the prisoner exchange were confirmed last year, but the swap was announced after outgoing US president Joe Biden handed over to Donald Trump, who was inaugurated on Monday. \"An Afghan fighter Khan Mohammed imprisoned in America has been released in exchange for American citizens and returned to the country,\" the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement. The ministry said Mohammed had been serving a life sentence in California after being arrested \"almost two decades ago\" in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar. Taliban government spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid told AFP two US nationals had been released, declining to provide any further details on the exchange. The family of US citizen Ryan Corbett, who was detained by the Taliban in 2022, confirmed he was released and expressed \"overwhelming gratitude\" that he was coming home. \"Today, our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan's life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,\" the family said on their website. They thanked both the Biden and Trump administrations, as well as Qatar, for Corbett's freedom, and called for two other Americans still held in Afghanistan to be released. US media named William McKenty as the second released American detainee, noting little was known about what he was doing in Afghanistan and that his family had asked the US government for privacy in his case. The New York Times said two other Americans remain in detention in Afghanistan, former airline mechanic George Glezmann and naturalised American Mahmood Habibi. In August 2024, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was seeking information about the disappearance of Afghan-American businessman Habibi two years previously. Biden came under heavy criticism for the chaotic withdrawal of US forces from Afghanistan in 2021, more than a year after Trump presided over a deal with the Taliban insurgents to end US and Nato involvement in the two-decade war. After Trump's election win in November, the Taliban government had said it hoped for a \"new chapter\" in ties with the United States. Taliban authorities have repeatedly said they want positive relations with every country since sweeping back to power in 2021. No state has officially recognised their government, with restrictions on women's rights a key sticking point for many countries, including the United States. The Taliban government on Tuesday called the exchange \"a good example of resolving issues through dialogue, expressing special gratitude for the effective role of the brotherly country of Qatar in this regard\". \"The Islamic Emirate views positively those actions of the United States that contribute to the normalisation and expansion of relations between the two countries,\" it added, using the Taliban authorities' name for their government. A 2008 US Department of Justice statement named Mohammed - aged 38 at the time - as a member of \"an Afghan Taliban cell\" and said he was arrested in October 2006 and sentenced in December 2008 to \"two terms of life in prison on drug and narco-terrorism charges\". It was the first narco-terrorism conviction in a US federal court, the statement said. Dozens of foreigners have been detained by the Taliban authorities since the group's return to power. It is unclear how many Afghan citizens are in US custody. At least one Afghan prisoner remains in detention at the secretive US prison Guantanamo Bay in Cuba, Muhammad Rahim, whose family called for his release in November 2023. In February last year, two former prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay until 2017 were welcomed home to Afghanistan, more than 20 years after they were arrested.",
