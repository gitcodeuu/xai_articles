Police officials, while confirming the bomb attack on the OGDCL vehicle, said that an improvised explosive device (IED) was planted on the road leading to the company's camp office on the outskirts of Qila Saifullah district headquarters by unknown miscreants. They said when the vehicle reached the area, the miscreants detonated the IED through a remote-control device. Two people travelling in the vehicle including the driver were seriously injured and shifted to the hospital where one of the injured died, Akhtar Hayat, a senior officer of the Qila Saifullah City police station, said. The man killed in the blast was identified as Gulla Khan Mirzai who had suffered multiple wounds in the bomb blast. The condition of the other injured OGDCL worker is also serious who was shifted to Quetta. \"The target was an OGDCL vehicle,\" Mr Hayat said, adding it was the second attack of the same nature in Qila Saifullah. Two months ago, unknown men had attacked a vehicle with an IED at the gate of the OGDCL camp office in which a driver was injured.
