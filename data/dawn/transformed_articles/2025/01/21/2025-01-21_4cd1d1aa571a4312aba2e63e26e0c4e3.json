    "article_body": "SWABI: A businessman was killed and his brother got injuries here on Monday when unidentified robbers opened fire on them after they resisted an attempt to snatch more than Rs10 million from them. The incident occurred in the limits of Chota Lahor City police station in broad daylight. The deceased businessman, Jamshed Khan, and his brother Firdous Khan belong to Kaya village, Chota Lahor tehsil, and they own a market in Topi main bazaar. The businessman and his brother were on way to bank to deposit the amount when robbers intercepted them near their house and tried to snatch the money from them at gunpoint. However, they resisted and robbers opened fire on them. As a result, Jamshed Khan was killed on the spot while his brother Firdous Khan suffered critical injuries. The body and injured were shifted to Bacha Khan Teaching Hospital. The robbers also took away the money. DSP Fazal Sher Khan said that more than Rs10 million was snatched from them. However, a source claimed that the amount was Rs15.2 million. Chota Lahor police station SHO Gohar Khan told this scribe at 4:30pm that an FIR was not registered yet. \"Police continue efforts and registration of case will take time. I will share information with you but you have to wait,\" he added. Another police official on condition of anonymity said that they were about to trace the robbers and would share news with the media soon. Meanwhile, traders of Topi tehsil staged a protest demonstration against the killing of their colleague. Former MPA Shiraz Khan and Topi tehsil mayor Rahim Jadoon participated in the protest. They said security should be provided to traders. They added that police failed to provide security to business community in the district. Addressing the protesters, Shiraz Khan said traders could not continue their business activities if they were not safe. \"We are standing with businessmen in this hour of grief,\" he said. Rahim said that the incident shook entire business community and they alleged that it was failure of police. He said that provision of security to businessmen should be one of the top priorities of government. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
