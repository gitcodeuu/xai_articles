    "article_body": "LAHORE: Three students were injured when Islami Jamiat Talba (IJT) allegedly attacked them in Punjab University New Campus on Monday. One of the students, a member of People Students Federation (PSF), had an altercation with some IJT activists outside the International Relations Department in the afternoon. Later, a number of IJT activists reached Hostel 14 and picked up the student and his two other fellows. The IJT activists armed with baton allegedly tortured three PSF activists and fled the scene. The injured were taken to nearby hospital where one of them was said to be critical and shifted to the intensive care unit (ICU). A PU spokesperson said that a minor altercation was turned into a major clash in the hostel and three of the PSF activists were injured. He said the administration would move police for the registration of the case against IJT activists. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
