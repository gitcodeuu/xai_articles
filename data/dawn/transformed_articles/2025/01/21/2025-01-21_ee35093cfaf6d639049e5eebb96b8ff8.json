    "article_body": "KARACHI: Amid a surge in flu cases and fears over the spread of Covid-19, the Directorate General Health Services Sindh has directed all district health offices to urgently increase active surveillance for the said viral infections at healthcare facilities. \"Ensure timely and accurate reporting of suspected and confirmed cases and availability and use of personal protective equipment (PPE), and other essential supplies at all healthcare facilities,\" the notification says. It also calls upon the officers to educate the community about the use of seasonal influenza vaccination among vulnerable groups, including healthcare workers, elderly individuals, and patients with chronic conditions. \"Reinforce infection control practices at all public and private healthcare facilities. Launch public awareness campaigns focusing on preventive measures such as mask-wearing, hand hygiene, and social distancing. Disseminate information about the symptoms of Covid-19 and H1N1 and the importance of seeking timely medical care,\" it says. Meanwhile, health minister Dr Azra Fazal Peechuho in a public video message dispelled the fears over the spread of Covid-19. \"There is no Covid-19 epidemic. Out of the 100 plus patients tested for Covid-19, only seven were positive for the infection. They had mild illness,\" she said, emphasising that the few Covid-19 cases being detected were treated as a flu case. Published in Dawn, January 21st, 2025",
