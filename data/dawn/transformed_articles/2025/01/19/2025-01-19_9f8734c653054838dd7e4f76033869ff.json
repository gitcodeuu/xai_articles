    "article_body": "CHARSADDA: Jamiat Ulema-i-Islam (Fazl) emir Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Saturday said that current assemblies had no significance, adding that the very basis of these legislatures was controversial. Speaking at a graduation ceremony at Darul Uloom Islamia, he pointed out that fraudulent and rigged elections should not be used to mislead the masses. He said that Hasina Wajid of Bangladesh had also won elections in a similar manner, but what fate she met is for everyone to see. Maulana Fazl regretted that the purpose of the politics today had become solely to gain power and positions. Alleges conspiracies being hatched against seminaries He said conspiracies were being hatched against seminaries at the global level to undermine the role of religious scholars. However, he said, madressahs and ulema would continue to play their positive role to thwart such conspiracies. He was accompanied by the head of the seminary and party's district leader, Maulana Gohar Shah, district spokesperson Haq Nawaz Durrani, and others. Maulana Fazl praised the religious scholars' contribution to society, adding that they were making efforts to spread the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him). He came down hard on the provincial government, saying it had completely failed to deliver. He recalled that the JUI-F had played an important role during the passage of the 26th amendment. He said it was because of their efforts that 34 controversial clauses had been deleted from the original draft and Islamic clauses added to it. He stressed that the protection of madressahs and politics was the responsibility of religious scholars. He criticised the country's leaders, adding that in the name of Islam such leaders were mocking the faith. The JUI-F chief asserted that the country does not belong to any individual or aristocracy but to all citizens, including bureaucrats and establishment. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
