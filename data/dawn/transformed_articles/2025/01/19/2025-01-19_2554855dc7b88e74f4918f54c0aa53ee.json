    "article_body": "QUETTA: The Forest and Wildlife Department of Balochistan has booked the owner of a private shopping mall and imposed a fine of Rs17 million for felling two ancient Chinar trees in Quetta. The action was taken after two Chinar trees (Oriental plane trees) on Hali Road were cut, according to Muhammad Niaz Khan Kakar, Quetta's divisional conservator of forest. These trees were in front of the shopping mall and had completed their due age. The trees were cut \"without adopting legal procedures\" and \"proper permission\" from the authorities, Mr Kakar said, adding that, as per the law, trees that have completed their biological age could not be cut. He said the department launched an operation and took into custody the remaining trees cut off by the mall management. The conservator said a fine of Rs17m for cutting trees has been imposed for the first time in the history of Quetta. Zarghoon Road, adjoining Hali Raod, was once full of Chimer, Indian Rosewood and Teak trees, some of which were planted a hundred years ago. The 2km road from GPO Chowk to the Railway DS office was also called Thandi Sarak, as the thick tree cover reduced the temperature during summer. Over time, several trees fell after completing their natural age while others were cut for development projects and road widening. Similarly, in the neighbouring Ziarat Valley, the world's second-largest Juniper forest was under threat due to excessive deforestation. The mountains around the valley, once covered with trees, now stood bare as thousands of trees were cut over the years. The Balochistan chief minister, Sarfaraz Bugti, has also directed the authorities to take action against those invovled in cutting trees and illegal hunting of wildlife.
