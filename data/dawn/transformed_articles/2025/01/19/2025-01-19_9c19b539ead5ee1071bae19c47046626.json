    "article_body": "QUETTA: Grand Health Alliance (GHA) Chairman Dr Bahar Shah and Dr Hafeez Mandokhail were re-arrested under the Maintenance of Public Order (MPO3) by the district administration on Saturday, following their release on bail. The GHA leaders, who had been arrested two days earlier, were produced before the local court. Their lawyers submitted bail applications, which were accepted, and they were subsequently released on bail. However, the police took them into custody immediately after their release and served them with orders from the Quetta deputy commissioner regarding their detention under MPO3. They were then sent to Quetta jail for a one-month detention. A spokesperson for the GHA condemned their detention under MPO3, stating that instead of addressing the issues, the authorities were resorting to vindictive actions. He accused the health minister and secretary of raiding doctors' homes, violating their privacy, and illegally detaining them. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
