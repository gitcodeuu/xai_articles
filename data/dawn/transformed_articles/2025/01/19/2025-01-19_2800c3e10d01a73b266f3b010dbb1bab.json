    "article_body": "QUETTA: Balochistan Health Minister Bakht Khan Kakar has assured protesting doctors that the government will resolve their demands but vowed not to buckle under pressure. Talking to the media on Friday, the minister said his government was \"ready to find solutions\" to the issues faced by doctors and other health workers in the province. However, the government won't be blackmailed by anyone or any organisation, Mr Kakar added. Doctors and paramedics across Balochistan have been on strike since Monday and have boycotted outpatient services and non-emergency operations. Mr Kakar warned the protesting doctors of strict action and emphasised that no emergency services, including OPDs, would be allowed to remain closed. Health minister says govt ready to address genuine demands He cited the order of the Balochistan High Court, which prohibited doctors and other medical staff from going on strike. He explained that according to the medical code, doctors and medical staff cannot go on strike as they are essential for emergency services. He added that 72 doctors, who are students and performing duties while receiving salaries, have been issued notices for going on strike. However, despite the warning, the Grand Health Alliance of doctors and other paramedical staff continued its strike in government hospitals across the province. Efforts to improve govt hospitals Mr Kakar said Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfaraz Bugti has issued clear directives that hospitals must provide medical services to patients. \"If any medicine is not available at the hospital, the medical superintendent will ensure the procurement and its cost will be borne by the government,\" the minister said while referring to the issue of medicine shortage in the province's hospitals. The government is taking \"emergency measures\" to improve government hospitals, and a task force will be formed to monitor the availability of medicines. He stated that civil hospitals have already been provided with medicines worth Rs550 million. \"In the past, there was no data on medicines, but now a system will be implemented to track them and prevent corruption,\" the minister claimed. Mr Kakar announced another task force to prevent newborns from being abandoned in hospitals and vowed legal action against guardians. An investigation has been launched into how funds for hospitals were misused in the past and legal action against the culprits will follow. He urged the support of civil society, media, and citizens to improve the standards of government hospitals. The minister said his government was determined to eliminate corruption in health, education, and other departments. Strike continues The Young Doctors Association Pakistan has also observed token strikes in other areas of Pakistan in support of the Grand Health Alliance. The association warned of a complete strike across the country if their demands were not accepted by Monday. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
