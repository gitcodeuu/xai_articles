    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: Islamabad High Court (IHC) Chief Justice Aamer Farooq will administer oath to the newly-appointed additional judges of the court on Monday. The law ministry had notified the appointment of Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas and Justice Mohammad Azam Khan on Saturday. The notification issued by the law ministry says, \"In exercise of the powers conferred by Article 197 read with Clause (8) of Article 175-A of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, the President of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is pleased to appoint following persons as Additional Judges of the Islamabad High Court for a period of one year with effect from the date they take oath of their office.\" Inaam Minhas, a prominent lawyer, played a key role in enhancing the vacancies of IHC judges when he was president of the Islamabad High Court Bar Association (IHCBA). He was also part of the Senate Committee on Legal Reforms at that time. He also actively lobbied for the restoration of the IHC when the then chief justice of Pakistan had declared it illegal along with other orders of former military ruler Pervez Musharraf, on Nov 3, 2007. Azam Khan served as an additional district and sessions judge in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Judicial Service until he was transferred to Islamabad Judicial Service in 2012. He held the important administrative positions and served as the special court judge, which was seized with the high treason case against former president retired Gen Pervez Musharraf. He also served on different administrative posts of the Islamabad High Court. His last assignment was that of sessions judge (West) Islamabad. Published in Dawn, January 19th, 2025",
