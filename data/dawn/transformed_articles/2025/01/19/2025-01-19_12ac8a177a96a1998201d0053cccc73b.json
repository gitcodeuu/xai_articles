    "article_body": "QUETTA: Balochistan Chief Minister Sarfraz Bugti on Saturday stressed the significance of the Reko Diq mining project, highlighting its potential to boost foreign investment and drive the province's development. He described the project as a \"milestone\" for Balochistan and the entire country. Speaking during a visit to the Reko Diq site, Mr Bugti emphasised that revenue generated from the project would primarily benefit the Chagai and Rakhshan divisions, ensuring that local communities, as the true stakeholders, reap the maximum benefits. He reiterated the government's commitment to empowering local communities through quality healthcare, education and skill development. He praised the Reko Diq Mining Company (RDMC) for its social development initiatives, which he said aligned with the provincial government's vision for inclusive growth. During the visit, the chief minister toured the Nokundi Mother and Child Health Centre and the Hunar Foundation Training Institute, commending the quality of services being provided. Mark Bristow, the CEO of Barrick Gold Corporation, the project's operator, hailed Reko Diq as a transformative venture for Balochistan's mining industry. He said Reko Diq has ushered in a new era of mining in the region, emphasising Barrick's commitment to making it a key driver of regional development.He highlighted the company's Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) efforts, which include initiatives in education, healthcare, clean water provision and skill development. These efforts aim to provide essential services to local communities before the project begins generating revenue. The project is set to begin operations this year, with production expected to begin by the end of 2028. Mr Bristow noted that Reko Diq was poised to become a world-class mining operation and reaffirmed Barrick Gold's role as a trusted partner between the federal and provincial governments.
