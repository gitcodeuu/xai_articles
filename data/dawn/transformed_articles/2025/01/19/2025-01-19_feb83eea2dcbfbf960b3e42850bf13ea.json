    "article_body": "A man thought to be a citizen of Bangladesh was arrested in India's financial capital Mumbai on Sunday and is considered the prime suspect in the stabbing of Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan, police said. Thursday's attack on Khan, one of India's most bankable stars, shocked the nation's film industry and Mumbai residents, with many calling for better policing and security. He was out of danger, doctors said, and has left the hospital. \"Primary evidence suggests that the accused is a Bangladeshi citizen and after entering India illegally he changed his name,\" Dixit Gedam, a deputy commissioner of police, told a press conference. The suspect, arrested on the outskirts of Mumbai, was using the name Vijay Das but is believed to be Mohammad Shariful Islam Shehzad and was working with a housekeeping agency after having come to the city five or six months ago, Gedam said. The police will seek custody of the suspect for further investigation, he added. Khan, 54, was stabbed six times by an intruder during a burglary attempt at his home. He had surgery after sustaining stab wounds to his spine, neck and hands, doctors said. Police in Mumbai detained a first key suspect in the attack on Friday, while police in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh detained a second person on Saturday.",
