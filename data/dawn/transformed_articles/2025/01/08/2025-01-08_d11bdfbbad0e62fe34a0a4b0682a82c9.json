    "article_body": "RAWALPINDI: All shops in Saddar remained closed for two hours on Tuesday on the call of Cantonment Traders Association against the closure of Bank Road for traffic by Rawalpindi Cantonment Board (RCB). However, the traders ended the protest in the afternoon after getting an assurance from cantonment officials that the issue would be resolved. RCB turned Bank Road into a walking corridor without any planning for traffic management and parking facilities for offices, shops and visitors which created rush in Saddar. On Tuesday, a token shutter-down strike was observed by shopkeepers of Bank Road, Kashmir Road, Adamjee Road, Haider Road from 2pm to 4pm. Traffic arrangements to be ensured, road to remain pedestrian corridor, says official Traders Association representatives Sheikh Hafeez, Zafar Qadri, Munir Baig Mirza, Munir Mughal, Mushtaq Khan and others led a protest at Kashmir Road and Bank Road Chowk. Speakers on the occasion also announced that they would not pay property tax to the RCB if their demands were not accepted. However, before the protesters announced to go to the cantonment office in the form of a rally, Additional Executive Officer Haider Shuja met traders' representatives at a nearby business centre. After the meeting, Sheikh Hafeez and Zafar Qadri announced that their demands, including the opening of Bank Road, would be accepted by the RCB. They informed the participants that the protest was being called off. Traders Association General Secretary Zafar Qadri told Dawn that cantonment officials led by the additional cantonment executive officer had requested the traders for a meeting. He said earlier the cantonment officials were not available and after the shutter-down strike they sent the additional cantonment executive officer for talks, adding, \"We believe in dialogue for solving problems so we accepted their assurance and ended the protest.\" Last week, traders had tried to meet cantonment officials to convince them not to close Bank Road but the latter refused to meet the traders.

The additional cantonment executive officer met traders' representatives to end the protest as it had created rush on The Mall and adjoining roads.
