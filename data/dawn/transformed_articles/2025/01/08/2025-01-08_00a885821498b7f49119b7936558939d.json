    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: As the Afghan embassy expressed concerns over the arbitrary detention of Afghan nationals in Islamabad, the capital administration said the crackdown only targeted undocumented citizens, with 183 Afghan nationals reportedly deported by the authorities during the current month. Islamabad Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon said those who had valid documents, such as Proof of Registration (PoR), Afghan Citizen Cards (ACC), visas, or those listed for third-country resettlement, were not being repatriated. The administration claimed only two undocumented Afghan nationals were being kept in 'holding areas'. The authorities continue to act strictly in accordance with the law, targeting only those who fail to present valid credentials, the administration said, urging foreign nationals to ensure they carried valid documentation to avoid any inconvenience. A police official told Dawn that they rounded up over 1,000 suspects during the past two days over suspicion of staying in the capital illegally. Out of the total, over 100 were deported, while the others were either 'held' or released. Another police officer said the number of Afghans staying in the capital without documentation was much higher compared to those who had valid visas. He claimed such refugees were coming to the capital either with families or individually. Pakistan was not a signatory of the 1951 Geneva Convention, but had welcomed Afghan refugees on humanitarian grounds, an officer said. There are refugee camps for Afghans: 44 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, nine in Balochistan, and one in Punjab but they have moved to urban areas and also bought properties. It may be noted that the Islamabad police chief, in a November press conference, said that foreigners, including Afghan nationals, who would create a law and order situation would not be allowed to stay in Islamabad. A deadline of Dec 31 was issued for the Afghan citizens to get a security clearance and obtain NOC from the capital administration to stay in the federal capital. Meanwhile, the Afghanistan embassy expressed \"deep concern over the recent detention of approximately 800 Afghan nationals in Islamabad, including individuals holding valid visas, PoR, and ACC cards\". \"The lack of clarity surrounding NOC requirements/issuance process has led to troubling cases of arbitrary detention and deportation,\" said the embassy in a tweet. \"Among those deported are 137 Afghan nationals whose visas had expired but who had already applied for extensions, as well as holders of temporary SHARP/UNHCR registration,\" it said.
