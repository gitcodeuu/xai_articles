    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: The Fertiliser Review Committee has expressed satisfaction with fertiliser production and its market supply position. The meeting, chaired by Industries and Production Minister Rana Tanveer Hussain, was informed on Thursday that the required balance prevailed in the supply and demand of urea for the Rabi season 2024-25, and the fertiliser manufacturing plants were operating efficiently across the country. The committee was informed that there would be no fertiliser shortage during the ongoing crop season and noted that prices were stable and would eventually benefit the farmers. Appreciating the price stability, the minister said it was a positive development for farmers. He also acknowledged the cooperation between the Power Division and the Fertiliser Committee, which has increased production. He directed that all fertiliser production units operate at full capacity to avoid shortfalls and meet the demand during the season. However, the committee was informed that local urea prices were lower than international prices, and there was a need for strict checks on the smuggling to Afghanistan and onwards to Central Asia. The minister emphasised strict action against hoarding and illegal profiteering and instructed upgrading fertiliser production plants with new technologies to improve production and enhance efficiency. Fertiliser is one of the five key sectors that have faced strict criticism from the authorities for being involved in tax evasion and making undue profits through improper means.
