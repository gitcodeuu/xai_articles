    "article_body": "DERA ISMAIL KHAN: A fire erupted in the forests of Koh-i-Suleman on Wednesday night, affecting various points of Dara Zinda tehsil. The fire quickly spread towards the olive and pine forests in the area. Rescue spokesperson Aizaz Mahmood stated that the fire broke out at four different locations, including the village of Tajori on the northern side and Al-Mar-Kalan village on the southern side. The blaze is causing damage to valuable trees, such as olive, pine nut, nettle, and gur-gure, and is also harming local wildlife and bird species. The flames can be seen from the tehsil headquarters in Darra Zinda. Locals report that the fire began two days ago, but in the past few hours, it has spread over several kilometres area and is clearly visible from the ground, especially during the night. According to sources in the forest department, forest fires occur every year and are often started by locals by burning dry grass. Strong winds cause the fire to spread, leading to significant damage to valuable forest areas. Rescue 1122 spokesperson confirmed that the fire had been brought under control through a joint operation involving Rescue 1122 and the wildlife department. In response to the emergency, techniques such as smothering and starvation were employed to extinguish the fire, which proved effective in the high mountainous regions, where fire trucks could not reach.
