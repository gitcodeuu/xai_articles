    "article_body": "QUETTA: After a heavy exchange of fire that ended in the death of three captors, the Levies and their quick-response force on Thursday managed to safely recover a man kidnapped by an armed gang in Qila Saifullah a day earlier. Jumma Rahim and his business partner Masood Khan were intercepted by kidnappers in Gawal Ismailzai - a locality between Qila Saifullah and Zhob - on Wednesday. Masood Khan was killed upon resistance while Mr Rahim was taken away, said Qila Saifullah Assistant Commissioner Naveed Alam. Soon after receiving information, the Levies and their quick-response force immediately started chasing the kidnapper alongside the tribesmen, who also joined the rescue operation. The kidnappers were encircled in a hilly terrain where heavy firing ensued. During the operation when forces tried to arrest them, two of them blew themselves up as they were reportedly wearing explosive-laden jackets while the third abductor was killed in firing. The bodies of the kidnappers were shifted to the hospital. Officials said that a search operation was underway to arrest other members of the gang involved in kidnapping for ransom.
