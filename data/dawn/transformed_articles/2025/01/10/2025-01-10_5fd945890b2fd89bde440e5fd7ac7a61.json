    "article_body": "KARACHI: While the Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) has accused the authorities of exacerbating the humanitarian crisis in Parachinar, and criticised the government's 'harsh' response to 'peaceful protests' organised in solidarity with the people of restive Kurram district, an anti-terrorism court has rejected bail applications of 17 MWM workers booked for assaulting policemen during sit-ins in Karachi in December last year. The court, however, granted bail to two senior MWM leaders. The 19 protesters had filed applications before the ATC-II in Clifton, seeking post-arrest bail. Addressing a press conference here on Thursday, MWM chief Senator Raja Nasir Abbas Jafari said that Parachinar is currently facing a dire humanitarian crisis. \"Over 130 innocent children have died as a result of shortages of food and essential supplies, while the lives of local residents have been paralysed,\" he said. \"And when we protested we were attacked. We strongly condemn the state's harsh response to peaceful protests organised in solidarity with the oppressed people of Parachinar. The Pakistan Peoples Party should be ashamed of its actions, which portrays itself as the champion of democracy. It has in fact violated democratic principles by attacking unarmed citizens in Sindh.\" He said that the conditions in Parachinar were deliberately being worsened with a population of millions facing extreme danger. The lack of medical supplies and food is causing further loss of life, he added. \"The people of Kurram, both Shia and Sunni, have never desired conflict. A peace agreement has been reached between the two factions, and its implementation now lies with the government,\" he added. He emphasised that all available resources should be mobilised to ensure lasting peace in the region. Any efforts to disrupt this peace should be met with stern action, he said. In his appeal to the people of Kurram, Senator Jafari urged them to socially boycott those responsible for creating obstacles in peace and expose the elements trying to destroy the country's stability. He stressed that, as Muslims, it is obligatory to raise one's voice against oppression, no matter where it occurs. Peaceful protests, he said, are both a constitutional and legal right. The MWM chief also urged PPP leader Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari to take notice of the \"brutality\" in Sindh and order investigations into the incidents. He demanded withdrawal of cases against peaceful protesters in Karachi and called for the immediate release of \"innocent\" detainees. ATC grants bail to two leaders An anti-terrorism court on Thursday granted bail to two Majlis Wahdat-i-Muslimeen (MWM) leaders but rejected the bail pleas of 17 other workers. The 19 protesters, including Maulana Asghar Shaheedi, were booked on charges of assaulting policemen, who were removing protesters staging sit-ins at Numaish Chowrangi in December. The suspects had filed applications before the ATC-II in Clifton, seeking post-arrest bail. After hearing both sides and the investigating officer (IO), the court granted bail to Maulana Shaheedi and Muhammad Abbas against surety bonds of Rs50,000 each. Meanwhile, the court rejected the bail pleas of the remaining 17 protesters. Last month, the MWM had staged sit-ins and blocked key arteries of the metropolis for several days to express solidarity with the heirs of the victims of the Parachinar violence in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Kurram district. According to the prosecution, when law enforcement agencies attempted to remove the protesters, they (suspects) allegedly opened fire, injuring one policeman. It further claimed that during the operation, three police personnel were also injured due to stone-pelting by the suspects. A case was registered against the suspects at the Solider Bazar police station under Sections 147 (rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Sections 6 and 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act.
