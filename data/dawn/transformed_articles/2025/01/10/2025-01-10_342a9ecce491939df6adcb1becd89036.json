    "article_body": "MIRPURKHAS: A man and his wife, appeared in the court of the second additional sessions judge of Mirpurkhas on Thursday for protection after the Sindh Human Rights Commission (SHRC) asked the district police to take action against the couple for \"forced conversion of the underage woman and their illegal marriage\". Upon receiving the SHRC communication on Wednesday, Mirpurkhas SSP Shabbir Ahmed Sethar had asked DSP Mir Aftab Talpur of Digri and SHO Haq Nawaz Junejo of the Kot Ghulam Mohammad police station to take legal action against the couple. However, following the court's order on Thursday, the SSP directed his subordinates to provide protection to the couple. According to the Hindu girl, Kajal Meghwar, daughter of Dayaram Meghwar, she had embraced Islam and wedded the Muslim man, Punhoon, son of Akbar, on their freewill on Dec 30, 2024. She submitted her application in the court for protection against police action. Published in Dawn, January 10th, 2025",
