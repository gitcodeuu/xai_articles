    "article_body": "ISLAMABAD: The role of private contractors became a thing of the past on Monday after the Capital Development Authority (CDA) took control of a shuttle service for citizens visiting the diplomatic enclave for their visa applications. Ten electric buses have been deployed for this service as CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa directed the CDA's engineering and design wings to provide the best facilities to visa applicants and upgrade facilities. The service commenced with 10 buses and Rs1,000 will be charged for a trip. Several officials appreciated the CDA/MCI move to end the role of the contractors and endorsed this service to stop the exploitation of citizens. \"The fare should be decreased from Rs1,000, as instead of focusing on revenue generation, the CDA/MCI should focus on providing services to citizens,\" said an official. It is relevant to note that private contractors, who were allowed to get Rs500 to Rs1,000 per trip, had been overcharging the passengers besides running an illegal car service, sometimes minting up to Rs20,000 per trip. Last year, a European diplomat had also informed the then CDA chairman about the overcharging issue faced by visitors to embassies. Following the complaint, the then chairman of the CDA, Anwarul Haq, chaired a meeting and reprimanded DMA officials, prompting them to issue a warning letter to the contractor on September 25. 10 e-buses allocated by civic body to charge Rs1,000 for each trip The bus service has put an end to this practice. Sources told Dawn that the private parties allegedly in connivance with the Directorate Municipal Administration were making all out efforts to remain in charge of the service instead of the CDA. The said service, which transports citizens from outside the diplomatic enclave to embassies inside the enclave, is seemingly the most expensive service across the country. It was launched after the 9/11 attack as a security measure after the federal government banned the entry of private vehicles into the enclave. The contract, which expired on Friday, was awarded in 2020 for Rs102.6 million per year. According to sources, some DMA officials wanted the service to \"continue\" through contractors because they allegedly enjoyed a good relationship with them. Now the CDA buses will charge Rs1,000 per passenger and a computerised fare system will be in place to facilitate the citizens. \"The CDA should run this service permanently to help citizens or this service should be ended for good and visa seekers should be allowed to move freely into the diplomatic enclave of their own country,\" said an official. It is relevant to note that on December 27, the DMA tried to award a new contract, but at the eleventh hour, the tender was deferred and one of the DMA officials was also suspended. Sources said that when the matter was brought to the notice of the chief commissioner, he had directed that instead of private contractors, the CDA's buses should be utilised for the services to help citizens. On the first day of the service, the contractor's staff was still present on the site. However, DMA Director Dr Sania Pasha told Dawn that there was no role of the contractor in running this service anymore. \"Today, some of their staff members were present there to guide the DMA staff about the operations. From now on, they have nothing to do with this project. They are not even allowed to enter the premises,\" she said. Published in Dawn, January 7th, 2025",
