Local residents and police said that the perpetrators first looted the shops and later set fire to them. They escaped the area. The shops were owned by Ejaz Wazir and Najeeb Wazir. Lower South Waziristan district police officer Asif Bahader confirmed the incident, but said that the cause of the fire was unknown. He said that an investigation was underway.
