Commenting on the claim of the petitioner that there are no arrangements for teaching of the Holy Quran in Sindh and Baluchistan, Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi remarked that he has learnt reading the Holy Quran (Nazira) in School in Sindh in 1971-72. Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan was surprised too to hear this and remarked that Baluchistan Assembly has legislated for compulsory teaching of the Holy Quran.

The Court directed the petitioner to provide if there is any evidence of teaching an objectionable translation of the Holy Quran and adjourned the proceedings for next hearing.",
