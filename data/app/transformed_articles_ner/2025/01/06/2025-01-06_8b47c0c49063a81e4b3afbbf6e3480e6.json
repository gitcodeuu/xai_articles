    "article_body": "KARACHI, Jan 06 (APP):Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal on Monday said that the federal government under Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif was committed to ensuring national uplift, which is reflected in the new initiative called aUraan Pakistana. While talking to media persons, along with Sindh Minister for Planning and Development and Energy Syed Nasir Hussain Shah after a meeting on federally-funded PSDP projects at Sindh Planning and Development Department, he acknowledged the challenges saying that they emerged as a mismanagement and mis-governance in the past by the poor conduct of the previous government.

Provincial competition on the basis of export initiatives must take place. Every province must create an export development board to work on factors that would improve export quality and general overall management. Ensuring a foolproof initiative to deal with export servicing will in turn lead to the funds being used for debt servicing and pipe them into projects that would hasten the progress of Pakistan. E-Pakistan is another aspect that must be absorbed as quickly as possible. aThe global arena is currently competing on which country is best able to adapt to the requirements and infrastructure for Artificial Intelligence. We need to generate a massive technology adoption.a Water and food security were also an alarming warning that was being given to us. He pointed the need for a green revolution.
