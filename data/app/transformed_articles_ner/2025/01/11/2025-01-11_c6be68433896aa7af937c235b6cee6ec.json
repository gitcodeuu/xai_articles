He lauded Pakistanas efforts in promoting gender equality, womenas empowerment, and girlsa education, acknowledging the progress made but emphasizing the need for further improvement.

Dr. Mohamad Hasbi bin Abubakar, President of Jamiyah Islamiyah Singapore, stressed the importance of leveraging human resources to improve education. He shared Singaporeas efforts in building an ecosystem to enhance womenas education, livelihood, and development despite its small size. Collaborative measures to make education accessible have had positive effects on overall development, he said, adding that Singapore remains committed to fostering an equitable education system. During the Q&A session, panelists emphasized the role of religious scholars and media in raising awareness about girlsa education at the grassroots level.
