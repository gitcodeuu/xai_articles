When asked about the expected temperature range, Sarfraz replied, aDaytime temperatures will struggle to rise above 8-10AC, while nighttime temperatures will plummet to as low as 2-4AC in some areas.a Sarfraz also cautioned that the cold wave may lead to foggy conditions in the mornings, potentially disrupting air and road travel. aWe urge everyone to check the weather forecast before embarking on their daily commutes and to exercise caution while driving in foggy conditions,a he added.
