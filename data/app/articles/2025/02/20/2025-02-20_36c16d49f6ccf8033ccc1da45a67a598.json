This report will provide a comprehensive analysis of gender-related indicators, highlighting progress in multiple sectors. While Pakistan has made significant reforms to enhance gender inclusivity, challenges in data collection and reporting mechanisms continue to impact international rankings, despite substantial on-ground efforts.\nThe UN Women delegation commended Pakistan’s efforts in advancing gender equality and reaffirmed its commitment to supporting the government in policy development, capacity-building programs, and institutional collaborations. Both sides emphasized the need for enhanced data analytics and evidence-based decision-making to accurately reflect Pakistan’s achievements in gender parity.\nThe meeting concluded on a positive note, with both parties reaffirming their dedication to strengthening collaboration in legal reforms, policy development, and inclusive governance frameworks to ensure sustained progress in women’s empowerment.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
