  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 23 (APP):The experts emphasized that counterterrorism cooperation between Pakistan and Iran remained a top priority for both the countries as they shared a fragile border vulnerable to violent attacks by armed non-state actors.\nThe experts made these remarks during an event held by Institute of Regional Studies Islamabad on Sunday, said a press release.\nSenior Fellow Abdul Basit underlined that the persistence of militant activities across Pak-Iran border necessitated a well-coordinated strategy to enhance security and curb insurgent movements.\nThe visit of late Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi to Pakistan led to an increased focus on security coordination and intelligence sharing but the region’s volatility was further heightened by the presence of terrorist groups like ISKP which had carried out attacks in both countries.\nSpeaking on the occasion, President IRS, Ambassador Jauhar Saleem, traced the history of counter terrorism cooperation between Pakistan and Iran, noting that the presence of  terror groups like TTP alongside Pak-Iran border posed a serious threat to both the countries.\nTo overcome these security challenges, Pakistan and Iran had deployed liaison officers at the border for enhanced coordination.\nAmb. Jauhar also pointed out that regional frameworks such as  SCO with its security arm of Regional Anti-Terrorism Structure (RATS) could help in addressing the issue of terrorism not only for Pakistan and Iran, but also the entire region. Towards this end, both the countries needed to work for a regional approach to address terrorism emanating from Afghanistan.’\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
