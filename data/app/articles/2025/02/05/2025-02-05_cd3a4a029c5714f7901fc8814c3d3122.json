She urged the United Nations (UN) to honor the promises made to the Kashmiris 78 years ago and to support their struggle for the right to self-determination.\nThe Chairperson emphasized the need for collective action to raise awareness about the plight of the Kashmiri people and to pressure the international community to intervene in resolving the longstanding dispute.\nShe also paid tribute to the sacrifices of Kashmiri martyrs and vowed that they would continue their struggle until a just resolution of the Kashmir dispute is achieved, in accordance with the UN-agreed formula and the aspirations of the people of the scenic valley.\nMushaal urged the international community to break its deafening silence and take immediate notice of the egregious human rights abuses perpetrated in occupied Kashmir.\nShe emphasized the imperative of collective action to halt the bloodshed and work towards a durable, peaceful resolution of the protracted conflict, aligning with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and UN resolutions.\nThe Chairperson highlighted the Indian atrocities and inhuman acts inflicted upon prisoners, particularly her husband Yasin Malik, and others.\nMushaal emphasized that the international community’s silence on the Kashmir issue was deafening, as despite the gross human rights violations, forced disappearances, torture and extrajudicial killings, the world miserably failed to take any action.\nShe went on to say that the so-called human rights organizations remained tight lipped and observed criminal silence over the unabated war crimes being committed by the supremacist Indian government.\nMushaal said that her husband has been languishing in notorious Tihar Jail, India, for years. She expressed concern about his health and well-being, fearing that he may be awarded a death sentence in the falsely framed, concocted and politically-motivated cases.\nThe chairperson appealed to the world leaders to uphold international human rights obligations and help implement the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions on Kashmir to find lasting and durable solution to the conflict.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
