For decades, they have endured oppression and injustice, yet their determination remains unshaken”.\nHe said that Pakistan stands resolutely with them (Kashmiris) not just in words but in action, raising their voices on every international platform, bringing attention to their plight, and advocating for a just resolution.\n“The right to self-determination is not a privilege but a fundamental right, recognized by the United Nations and the global community. No force can suppress a people’s aspiration for freedom forever. We urge the world to break its silence to stand for justice and to demand an end to the suffering of innocent Kashmiris”, he added.\n“On this day, we honour the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people and remind them that Pakistan stands beside them today and always until justice prevails and their voices were truly heard”, he maintained.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
