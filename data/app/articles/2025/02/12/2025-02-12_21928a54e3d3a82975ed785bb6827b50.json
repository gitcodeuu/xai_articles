By utilizing radio, these efforts are helping to spread knowledge and encourage positive actions across the country.\nFakhra Nadeem, Managing Director of Power FM 99, expressed concern over the limited coverage of climate change, noting that mainstream media often reports on its effects in isolation.\nShe said that radio’s reach, particularly in remote and rural areas, makes it an ideal platform to educate communities on the causes and impacts of climate change.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
