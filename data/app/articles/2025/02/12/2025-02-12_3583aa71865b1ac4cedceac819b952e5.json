  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 12 (APP):Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari on Wednesday informed the National Assembly that employees of Power Generation Companies (GENCOs) will either be absorbed into distribution companies (DISCOs) or laid off with full compensation, ensuring their rights are not compromised.\nResponding to a calling attention notice regarding the recent decision not to absorb GENCOs employees into DISCOs and other organizations under the Power Division, he clarified that DISCOs are currently facing a staff shortage. Therefore, instead of hiring new workers, GENCOs employees will be accommodated.\nHe revealed that details of 1,335 employees, primarily non-engineering support staff, have already been shared with various DISCOs. He assured that those retiring would receive fair compensation.\nHe said that  GENCOs employees, cost the government Rs. 7 billion annually in salaries, neither belong to the engineering sector nor contribute significantly to the economy.\nHe disclosed that the Guddu and Nandipur power plants are included in the privatization list, stating that these plants are completely non-operational and incapable of generating electricity. “Employees at these closed plants are burdening power consumers with Rs. 7 billion annually,” he said, adding that some workers report for duty without any productive tasks.\nThe government, based on recommendations from the Ministry of Energy, has decided to either sell the non-operational plants and use the proceeds for employee pensions and benefits or merge surplus employees into DISCOs.\nThe minister clarified that Nandipur and Guddu GENCOs are in the final stages of privatization, with balance sheets and clearance processes completed.\nHe also mentioned that a delegation from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) recently raised concerns regarding job security for affected employees. “Employees will either be merged into DISCOs or given full compensation, including Rs. 35 billion in pension benefits, within the next one to two months,” he assured.\nMeanwhile, Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif acknowledged that unproductive employees place a burden on taxpayers.\nHe stressed the need for alternative employment opportunities for displaced workers and called for a rational approach to restructuring.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
