We want to ensure that no child is left behind,” he said.\nThe Education Secretary stressed the need for community ownership of these schools, urging local residents to take pride in and actively participate in maintaining the upgraded facilities.\nHe also revealed plans to extend the initiative to Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir, where schools will undergo similar transformations. Additionally, Danish Schools, known for their high standards, will soon begin operations in these regions.\nWani expressed his gratitude to the officers and staff who worked tirelessly to bring the project to fruition. This is not just a government effort; it is a collective achievement. Everyone should own these projects.\nHe further emphasized the importance of creating a comfortable and aesthetically pleasing environment for students, stating that conventional methods of running schools are no longer sufficient.\n“We cannot compete with private sector schools unless we provide a similar level of comfort and facilities to our students,” he added.\nThe ministry is also focusing on skill-based education and entrepreneurship, with plans to enhance teacher training and capacity building.\nWani believes that equipping students with practical skills will prepare them for the challenges of the modern world.\nParliamentary Secretary Farah Naz commended Secretary Wani for his efforts in reforming public sector schools. “This is just the beginning. We are committed to ensuring that future generations are equipped with the latest and most modern education,” she said.\nThe event concluded on a heartwarming note as students greeted Wani with rose petals, expressing their excitement and gratitude for the upgraded facilities.\nThe ceremony not only marked the revival of a single school but also signaled a brighter future for public education in the federal capital and beyond.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
