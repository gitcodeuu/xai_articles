Europe, Central Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean report lower rates.\nRomina citing research reference said the main activities that attract volunteers in Pakistan are environmental projects, healthcare, community development, sports, disaster relief and youth and volunteer development programmes and added: “Volunteers are at the heart of global climate diplomacy. They serve as the backbone of many initiatives, providing invaluable support and raising awareness among the public about pressing climate change concerns.”\nRomina stressed the vital role that volunteers can play in raising awareness and advocating for climate actions and reflected on her experiences during the COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan, where she witnessed the incredible contribution of volunteers who served delegates from across the globe.\nA United Nations Population Fund report indicates that 64% of Pakistan’s population is under 29, and some are driven to volunteerism despite facing unemployment.\nThe meeting centered around the role of youth and volunteers in addressing climate change, highlighting their importance in fostering greater public participation and advancing the national climate agenda.\nRomina urged the delegation to take an active role in promoting volunteerism among the youth. She encouraged them to contribute to shaping a positive narrative for the country, highlighting its green initiatives and its minimal contribution to global carbon emissions, thus enhancing its soft image internationally.\nThe delegation members pledged their full support in organizing volunteer programs and building partnerships with various stakeholders to enhance the impact of the climate taskforce, environmental sustainability and green Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
