This called for renewed commitment and intensified efforts to alleviate the burden of this disease, he added.\n“The Government of Pakistan, in collaboration with provincial governments, healthcare institutions, and global partners, is making efforts to address this issue. We have initiated measures to strengthen our healthcare infrastructure, conduct a comprehensive situation analysis of cancer interventions, develop national and provincial cancer strategies, and mobilise resources through innovative public-private partnerships,” the president said.\nCancer was not only a health issue but also a societal challenge requiring collective efforts, he said, stressing that they needed to raise awareness about the disease and, in this regard, the support of the media was highly important to educate the people about its symptoms, prevention and early detection.\n“I firmly believe that we can overcome this challenge through the active support of civil society, media, community-based organizations, and international partners. On this occasion, I urge all citizens, healthcare professionals, civil society, and the private sector to join hands in this noble cause. Together, we can ensure that every individual, regardless of socioeconomic status, has access to timely diagnosis, effective treatment, and compassionate care,” President Secretariat Press Wing, in a press release, quoted the president as saying.\nThe president said that they should pledge to make cancer prevention and control a national priority, expressing his confidence that together, they could bring hope and healing to those affected and honour the lives of those who had been lost to this disease.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
