The first case of 2025 has already been detected in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Dera Ismail Khan, reminding us that the virus remains a serious threat,” he said. Environmental surveillance has also identified the presence of the poliovirus in several areas across Sindh, reinforcing the need for ongoing vigilance.\nThe Chief Minister commended the dedication of Sindh’s 82,000 frontline polio workers, who go door to door often under challenging conditions to protect children from this debilitating disease. “These workers are the true heroes of this campaign”, he added.\nTo ensure their safety, we have deployed 21,844 security personnel,” he announced, expressing deep appreciation for the Sindh police’s efforts in safeguarding health teams.\nSending a strong message against any resistance to the vaccination drive, the CM asserted, “We have zero tolerance for any threats or obstruction against our polio teams,” he said and added that anyone attempting to hinder this campaign would face strict legal action.\n“These workers are not just health staff; they are protectors of our children’s future and deserve our full respect and support,” he said.\nHe also introduced a new performance scorecard developed by Chief Secretary Asif Hyder Shah to evaluate efforts at the district level. Best-performing districts will be recognised while under performing areas will be held accountable.\nHe urged parents to cooperate with the vaccination teams, saying, “Open your doors to the polio teams. Don’t let myths or misinformation endanger your child’s future,” he said and added that the polio vaccine was safe, effective, and free of cost.\n“Even if a child has been vaccinated before, they need multiple doses to build strong immunity,” he said.\nAdditionally, he called upon religious leaders, teachers, community elders, and influencers to use their voices to encourage participation in the campaign.\n“Together, with our collective efforts, we will make Sindh – and Pakistan – polio-free. This is our chance to be part of history, fulfilling the vision initiated by Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
