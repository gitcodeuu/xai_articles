We must combat illegal wildlife trade, protect their habitats, and ensure a future where these unique creatures can thrive,” he said.\nWWF-Pakistan has already taken significant steps to conserve pangolins. The organization has collaborated with the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and Punjab Wildlife Departments to implement the “Saving the Pangolin of Pakistan” project. Surveys to map species distribution in KP have been completed, and a community-based Pangolin Protection Zone is being established in the southern districts of the province.\nAdditionally, WWF-Pakistan has partnered with the Tikki Hywood Foundation from Zimbabwe to install radio transmitters for studying pangolin habitats and establish a rehabilitation center. The organization has also implemented the Spatial Monitoring and Reporting Tool (SMART) in key pangolin habitats and developed SAFE Systems strategies to manage human-pangolin conflicts.\nWWF-Pakistan has called on provincial wildlife departments, law enforcement agencies, and local communities to join hands in protecting this critically endangered species. “The time to act is now. If we fail to protect pangolins, we risk losing them forever,” the organization stated in its press release.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
