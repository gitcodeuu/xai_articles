However, last year the incumbent government took a bold initiative and made Hajj system corruption free, he added.\nHe commended Federal Minister for Religious Affairs Chaudhry Salik Hussain for his dedication to making Hajj system transparent and corruption-free.\nThis year, the government had partnered a top-tier company for official Hajj program to ensure better services as compared to the facilities provided by private operators, he added.\nHe, however, regretted that people spent huge money on Hajji but they were not ready to pay taxes in Pakistan.\nAshrafi also highlighted tourism potential of Pakistan and suggested that with proper planning, the country could earn $ 1 billion annually from religious tourism.\nHowever, he lamented that Pakistan’s reputation was often tarnished by reports of begging and drug smuggling by some elements who were traveling to Saudi Arabia and Iraq.\nHe stressed the need for better training for the intending pilgrims and requested Faisalabad Chamber of Commerce & Industry (FCCI) to establish a fund for Hajj training programs.\nHe advised the pilgrims to strictly follow Saudi guidelines and avoid from unnecessary social media usage. They should respect and obey both Pakistani and Saudi laws to ensure a smooth pilgrimage experience, he added.\nFCCI President Rehan Naseem Bharara, Senior Vice President Qaisar Shams Guccha, Vice President Shahid Mumtaz Bajwa and Secretary General Muhammad Ayub were also present in the seminar.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
