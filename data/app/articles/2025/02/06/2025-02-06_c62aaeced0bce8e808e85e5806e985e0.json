The total budget allocated for this initiative was Rs 204 million, he added.\nThe minister highlighted that significant progress has been made in resolving internal issues within the national TV.\n“We have ensured timely payment of salaries to employees, unlike some private media organizations that fail to pay their staff on time,” he stated.\nThe minister also revealed plans to establish a major PTV Center in Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, offering internships to students in the region.\nHe expressed concerns over foreign-backed campaigns aimed at inciting rebellion among the youth in these areas. “Through media, we will address these issues and guide the youth towards a positive direction,” he asserted.\nThe minister further elaborated on the improvements in the PTV Sports Channel, stating that corrupt elements have been removed, and a strong team has been assembled, yielding positive results.\nHe also mentioned ongoing efforts to enhance the performance of PTV and Radio Pakistan, with a focus on expanding coverage in Gilgit-Baltistan and AJK.\nAddressing the issue of financial losses incurred during the tenure of former Minister for Information Fawad Chaudhry, the minister revealed that a court case was underway regarding a controversial contract.\nHe expressed optimism that canceling the controversial contract would double the PTVs revenue.\nThe minister also pointed out that the provincial governments were not adequately supporting the national broadcaster. “While we provide extensive coverage to the provinces, it is their responsibility to allocate advertisements for PTV and Radio Pakistan,” he said.\nThe meeting also reviewed the issues of rents of properties of Radio Pakistan and PTV.\nFederal Secretary Information Ambreen Jan told the meeting that the rents of properties of government institutions are determined by the Ministry of Housing.\nThe committee sought details of properties rented by both institutions in the next meeting.\nThe meeting concluded with a consensus on the need for a balanced approach to media regulation, ensuring both freedom of expression and accountability.\nThe committee members expressed their commitment to working collaboratively to address the challenges faced by the media industry in Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
