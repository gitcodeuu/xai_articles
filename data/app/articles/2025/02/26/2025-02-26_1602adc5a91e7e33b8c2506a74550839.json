The mid-term UPR report will be submitted soon, reinforcing Pakistan’s proactive approach to human rights commitments.\nAddressing global human rights concerns, the Minister condemned Israel’s ongoing atrocities in occupied Palestine, particularly in Gaza, and reiterated that forced displacement and demographic re-engineering violate fundamental principles of international law. He urged the international community to take decisive action to uphold Palestinian rights.\nThe Minister also denounced India’s illegal occupation of Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK) and its continued denial of the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination. He called on the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) to continue monitoring the situation and update its Kashmir reports, while urging the establishment of a Commission of Inquiry to investigate systematic human rights violations in IIOJK.\nExpressing grave concern over the global rise in religious intolerance, particularly Islamophobia, the Minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to combating all forms of discrimination, hostility, and violence based on religion or belief.\nAs a nation aspiring to serve its sixth term on the Human Rights Council, Pakistan remains a steadfast supporter of the Council’s mandate and a vocal advocate for justice, equality, and human dignity worldwide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
