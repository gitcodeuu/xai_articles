He clarified that under the rules, points of order could only be addressed after the completion of the Question Hour and the agenda. Nevertheless, he had been granting the floor for such matters.\nHowever, he said that he would be compelled to strictly follow the rules.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
