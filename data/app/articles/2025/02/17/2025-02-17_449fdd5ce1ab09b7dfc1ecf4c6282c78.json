  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 17 (APP):Engro Polymer and Chemicals (EPCL), a subsidiary of Engro Corporation, has commissioned its Rs 11.7 billion hydrogen peroxide plant, marking a major milestone in its journey of undertaking investments that drive Pakistan’s economic growth.\nThis project has been developed with investment from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to support EPCL’s expansion in the hydrogen peroxide market, said a news release.\nWith an installed annual capacity of 28,000 tons, the hydrogen peroxide plant features state-of-the-art Chematur technology. By ensuring sufficient local production, EPCL will enable import substitution of around USD 11 million, reducing reliance on foreign suppliers and strengthening Pakistan’s industrial base.\nThe company will manufacture and market its high-quality hydrogen peroxide solution, PureOxide, under its wholly owned subsidiary, Engro Peroxide (Private) Limited. As the only hydrogen peroxide manufacturer in southern Pakistan, the company aims to be a responsible supplier offering high quality, reliable delivery and safe packaging with its PureOxide brand.\nCustomers will benefit from lower lead time and costs through just-in-time deliveries in a safety-compliant fleet. PureOxide will be transported in 100% virgin HDPE jerry cans, featuring pressure-release technology to prevent explosions and a vapor-blocking membrane to mitigate fire risks. Additionally, PureOxide has a lower carbon footprint and higher energy efficiency as EPCL derives hydrogen as part of its caustic manufacturing process.\nCommenting on the milestone, Abdul Qayoom Shaikh – CEO of EPCL, said that, “Our HPO business will strengthen local industries, especially export-oriented textiles players, who will be able to source a high-quality product locally. With unmatched quality, safety and sustainability, we are confident that PureOxide will become the preferred choice for customers in Pakistan and beyond.”\nAhsan Zafar Syed, President & CEO – Engro Corporation, added that, “Our Rs 12 billion investment in the hydrogen peroxide plant reflects Engro’s commitment to growth and continued belief in Pakistan’s potential. I would like to thank the EPCL leadership, IFC, project team, partners, and other stakeholders for their support in the successful completion of this project.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
