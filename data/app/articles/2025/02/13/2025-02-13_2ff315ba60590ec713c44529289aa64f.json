  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 13 (APP):Chairman of the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC), Engr Waseem Nazir, Thursday emphasized the need for a structured approach to dispute resolution in the construction industry.\nHe highlighted four key fundamentals including capacity building, legislative support, a resolution framework, and awareness of alternative dispute resolution (ADR).\nSpeaking at the International Alternate Dispute Resolution Conference 2025, organized by the Lahore High Court Bar Association, he addressed the critical role ADR plays in resolving commercial disputes.\nChairman PEC Engr Waseem Nazir pointed out that Pakistan’s construction industry lacks a culture of dispute resolution due to social pressure and other barriers, leading to prolonged legal battles.\nHe hinted at the staggering amount involved  in the cases that remain pending in courts, hampering industry progress.\nHe stressed that contractors, consultants, and clients must develop trust in settlement mechanisms, as delays in construction disputes waste public funds, time, and resources.\nTo address these challenges, Engr Waseem Nazir called for strategic interventions involving regulators, industry stakeholders, and the judiciary. He underscored the need for efficient reconciliation methods, stating that progress depends on the ability to streamline dispute resolution.\nThe PEC, under its mandate, is actively working with the judiciary to establish ADR centers, aiming to make dispute resolution an integral part of the construction industry.\nChairman PEC Engr Waseem Nazir said PEC is establishing Alternate Dispute Resolution centers, staffed by expert professionals to mediate disputes in large-scale projects. These centers will conduct hearings, involving all concerned parties, and provide expert opinions to facilitate resolution.\nHe emphasized that ensuring national and international investment security is a priority, and these centers will play a crucial role in achieving that goal.\nThe conference was attended by senior members of the judiciary, including Supreme Court Senior Judge Justice Mansoor Ali Shah, former DG Judicial Academy Justice (R) Sardar Ahmad Naeem, and Lahore High Court Justices Jawad ul Hassan, Asim Hafeez, and Sultan Tanveer Ahmad.\nOther notable attendees included the Chairman of the Lahore Chamber of Commerce, Lahore High Court Bar Association President Asad Manzoor Butt, Secretary Qadir Baksh, and Vice President Mian Sardar Ali.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
