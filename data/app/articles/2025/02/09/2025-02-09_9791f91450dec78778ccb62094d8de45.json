Over the past 11 months, more than 120+ reforms have been implemented across multiple sectors, shaping the country’s governance, economic policies, legal frameworks, and institutional efficiencies.\nThis initiative is crucial in providing an accurate and transparent account of policy transformations, allowing stakeholders – including policymakers, businesses, and international institutions – to engage with and evaluate Pakistan’s evolving governance landscape.\nBy bridging the information gap, the Pakistan Reforms Report 2025 ensured that reforms are acknowledged, analysed, and serve as a foundation for future governance advancements.\nUnlike most international reports that capture data only from January to May every year, the Pakistan Reforms Report 2025 offers a full-year assessment, presenting a more accurate and holistic picture of governance, accountability, and inclusivity reforms.\nSpeaking at the launch of the Pakistan Reforms Report 2025, Amir Jahangir, Chief Executive Officer of Mishal Pakistan, the Country Partner Institute of the World Economic Forum, highlighted the significance of the report and said, “The Pakistan Reforms Report 2025 is an unprecedented initiative aimed at bridging the knowledge gap in governance reforms. While international assessments often focus on fragmented data, this report presents a full-spectrum analysis of how Pakistan has transformed under the prime minister administration.”\nHe further said, “By documenting reforms in a structured and accessible manner, we empower policymakers, businesses, and global institutions with the knowledge needed to engage with Pakistan’s evolving governance landscape.”\nThe Pakistan Reforms Report 2025 is an essential resource for policymakers, investors, academics, and development organizations seeking to understand Pakistan’s evolving governance framework. Through extensive research, data collection, and stakeholder engagement, the report provides a structured, transparent, and comprehensive overview of the government’s performance in key areas.\nMishal Pakistan is an award-winning business intelligence, public policy, and strategic communications institution.
