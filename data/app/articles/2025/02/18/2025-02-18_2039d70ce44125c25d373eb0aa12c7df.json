He mentioned the establishment of the Consortium of Excellence (CoE), a network of top OIC research institutions, and research fellowships in virology and vaccine development in collaboration with host institutions in Indonesia and Pakistan.\nHe also spoke about scholarship programs for Palestinian and African students, the COMSTECH Technology Portal and Expert Service to facilitate research collaborations, and training programs for technical personnel in handling sophisticated research and lab equipment.\nAdditionally, he highlighted health and STI capacity-building programs for LDC countries in Africa, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Gambia, Niger, Senegal, and Uganda, along with eye camps and medical training workshops in Benin, Chad, and Uganda. COMSTECH is also working on capacity building in medicine and Halal product standardization.\nProf. Choudhary emphasized that this conference presents a unique opportunity to foster knowledge exchange and collaboration among experts, policymakers, and researchers.\nHe called for greater investment in scientific research and local solutions to effectively combat NTDs and improve global health equity.\nExpressing deep gratitude to ICESCO and all participating organizations for their collaboration and commitment to addressing NTDs, he urged all stakeholders to work together towards a healthier, more equitable world and looked forward to fruitful discussions over the next three days.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
