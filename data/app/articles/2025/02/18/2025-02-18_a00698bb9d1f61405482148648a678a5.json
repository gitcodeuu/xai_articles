The actual cost of the project was Rs 4000 million but it was completed at a cost of Rs 3,655 million.\nInterior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said under the prime minister’s direction, the project which was earlier scheduled to be completed in six months had been built in the shortest possible time of 84 days.\nHe further added that a large-scale plantation drive would be launched next month at Margalla Hills and throughout the city to combat air pollution and reduce smog.\nThis project also includes the construction of 4.3 kilometers of roads connecting to F-10, along with 2 kilometers of drains for rainwater drainage.\nUpon completion of the project, 70,000 vehicles per day will benefit from this flyover. Before the project’s completion, around 41,000 vehicles passed through F-8 Chowk daily.\nThis project will benefit residents traveling towards Sector G-8, G-9, Kashmir Highway, and Centaurus Mall.\nThe 1.3-kilometer-long underpass included in the project was completed in 42 days, and a 1.1-kilometer-long flyover has also been constructed.",
