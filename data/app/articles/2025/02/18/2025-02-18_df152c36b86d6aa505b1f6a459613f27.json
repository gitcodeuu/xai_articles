The NCRC was chaired by Dr. Najma Iqbal Malik from the University of Sargodha and co-chaired by Dr. Shahid Iqbal from the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science & Technology, with Mr. Muhammad Ali Baig, Deputy Director at HEC, serving as Secretary of the Committee.\nThe Associate Degree in Psychology will now consist of a minimum of 71 credit hours, while the BS Psychology programme will require a minimum of 134 credit hours. The revised BS Psychology curriculum includes provisions for specialization, offering students the opportunity to focus on areas such as Clinical Psychology, Cognitive Neuroscience, Developmental Psychology, Educational Psychology, Forensic Psychology, Health Psychology, and Industrial-Organizational Psychology.\nUniversities are also encouraged to introduce additional specializations based on faculty expertise and institutional resources. Recognizing the importance of experiential learning, the BS Psychology programme now mandates a supervised internship and a capstone project, each carrying three credit hours, to provide students with hands-on experience in real-world settings. This requirement does not apply to the Associate Degree.\nThe MS Psychology programme has been restructured to include two core courses, six electives, three supervised internships, and a mandatory research component.\nElective courses will be offered based on the availability of faculty and institutional resources. The revised curricula encompass essential academic standards, including eligibility criteria, programme learning outcomes, model schemes of study, course learning outcomes, and degree award requirements. Universities retain the flexibility to determine specific course content while ensuring alignment with contemporary industry and research needs.\nThe HEC has formally issued a notification instructing all universities to implement the revised curricula at the earliest, ensuring consistency and standardization in psychology education across Pakistan. The updated curricula mark a significant step towards modernizing psychology education in Pakistan, equipping graduates with the knowledge and skills required to excel in academia, research, and professional practice.\nHEC remains committed to continuously improving higher education standards in the country, fostering academic excellence, and preparing students to meet global challenges in psychological sciences.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
