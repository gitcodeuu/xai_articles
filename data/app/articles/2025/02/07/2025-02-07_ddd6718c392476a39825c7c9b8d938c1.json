He also advised people to invest their resources in legal employment opportunities rather than paying huge sums to human traffickers.\nHe pointed out that illegal migration not only put individuals at risk but also negatively impacted genuine travelers, making visa approvals more difficult.\nAt the airport, a collective dua was offered for the departed souls before the mortal remains were handed over to their families.\nUnder the directives of Pakistan Sweet Home CEO Zamarud Khan, ambulances were provided to transport the bodies to their hometowns.\nSo far, eight out of 13 bodies have been repatriated, while the remaining five are expected to be transported next week.\nThe bodies were identified after an extensive process of verification by the National Database Registration Authority (NADRA).\nAdditionally, the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF) has set up a facilitation desk at the airport for the families of the deceased.\nA boat carrying 80 passengers, including several Pakistani nationals, setting off from Mauritania, had capsized near the Moroccan port of Dakhla.\nSeveral survivors, including Pakistanis, were lodged in a camp near Dakhla and the Embassy of Pakistan in Rabat remained in touch with the local authorities. The Crisis Management Unit (CMU) in the Foreign Ministry was activated and the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar had instructed the relevant government agencies to extend all possible facilitation to the affected Pakistanis.",
