The delegation held an inclusive meeting with Mohammad Ahmad Muslim Al Khalayleh, Jordanian Minister of Awqaf Islamic Affairs and Holy Places, and other officials.\nDuring the meeting with the Jordanian minister, Abdul Habib emphasized that the core mission of FGRF is to provide extensive support to Palestinian Muslims, just as it had done for victims of the devastating earthquakes in Syria and Turkey.

He assured full cooperation and support for the proposed welfare projects.\nThe FGRF spokesperson expressed optimism that following Maulana Abdul Habib Attari’s meeting with Jordanian minister and other officials, various humanitarian initiatives for Gaza and Palestinian Muslims will commence soon.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
