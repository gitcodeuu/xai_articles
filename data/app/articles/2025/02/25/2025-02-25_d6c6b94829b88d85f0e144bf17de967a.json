  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 25 (APP):Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and Bakhabar Kissan (BKK), with M/S JAZZ as its communication partner have signed an agreement to empower farmers with smart agricultural solutions using space technology.\nThis collaboration aims to drive a sustainable and productive food system in Pakistan by integrating advanced satellite technology into farming practices.\nSince 1989, SUPARCO has played its role in the country’s socio-economic development by leveraging satellite technology to monitor crops and provide timely insights to relevant ministries and departments.\nThis agreement with BKK marks a significant step toward ensuring that crucial agricultural data reaches farmers directly, enabling informed decision-making at the grassroots level.\nSUPARCO will provide Artificial Intelligence (AI)-powered geospatial services to BKK through an Application Programming Interface (API), utilizing high-resolution satellite imagery from its diverse fleet of remote sensing satellites. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, SUPARCO will process vast datasets, performing mass computation with unparalleled efficiency to offer real-time decision-making tools for farmers.\nBKK, in turn, will use this space-based intelligence to provide tailored agricultural consultation through its mobile app, reaching farmers directly.\nBy combining SUPARCO’s strategic oversight from space with BKK’s on-ground connectivity, this partnership will transform cutting-edge satellite intelligence into practical solutions for farmers.\nThis collaboration will enable real-time monitoring of crop health, soil conditions, and weather patterns, advancing precision and smart farming practices.\nFarmers will gain access to data-driven insights for optimized planting, irrigation, fertilization, and pest control-leading to higher yields, reduced input costs, and improved sustainability.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Chairman SUPARCO, Muhammad Yusuf Khan emphasized the importance of this initiative, stating, “This partnership demonstrates our commitment to harnessing space technology for national progress. By bridging the gap between science and agriculture, we are empowering farmers with vital information that will enhance productivity and sustainability.”\nThis collaboration marks a transformative step toward precision agriculture in Pakistan, paving the way for enhanced national food security, improved policymaking, better market price stabilization, and more efficient supply chain management.\nBy integrating space technology into farming, Pakistan is moving towards a smarter, more efficient agricultural future, supporting the vision of “Uraan Pakistan”.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
