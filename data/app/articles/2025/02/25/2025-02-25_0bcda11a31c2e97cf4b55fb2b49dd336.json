After serving a show-cause notice to deputy registrar judicial, the court was adjourned, it said, adding that the division bench was not authorize to issue such order.\nThe appeal further adopted the stance that the constitutional bench had already withdrawn the orders of January 13, and 16.\nAfter the 26th constitutional amendment, a regular bench couldn’t hear cases pertaining to the interpretation of constitution, it added.\nIt may be mentioned here that a division bench comprising Justice Mansoor Ali Shah and Justice Aqeel Abbasi had passed an order on January 27, in deputy registrar judicial contempt case.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
