  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 11 (APP):Federal Minister of Housing and Works Riaz Hussain Pirzada on Tuesday urged the leader of the opposition to refrain from making irresponsible statements regarding the water issue and said that such matters should be resolved through the Council of Common Interests (CCI).\nSpeaking in the National Assembly, he said that under the Indus Waters Treaty, the Sutlej River’s water supply to Bahawalpur was cut off, making water distribution a serious national issue that requires collective decision-making.\nHe further mentioned that Punjab’s share of water from the Diamer-Bhasha Dam has been proposed to provide water to Bahawalpur and stressed the need to avoid any misleading narratives.\nThe minister highlighted that Bahawalpur has already lost one of its rivers and has the right to demand its fair share of water. He called for a responsible, fact-based approach to resolving the issue rather than creating public confusion through baseless statements.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
