Once the names are received, the process for appointing the next Chief Election Commissioner will commence.”\nAddressing another matter, he said that it had been agreed no point of order would be raised during the Question Hour. “We are following the principles agreed upon during the meeting,” he added.\nResponding to another point, he asserted, “Nobody has the right to make statements against the Parliament of Pakistan. This is our prerogative.”\nHe further expressed regret over the 2013 and 2024 Parliaments being labelled as illegitimate, saying, “This is not acceptable. When you win, the Parliament is legitimate, but when others win, it is considered illegitimate.”\nEarlier, Omar Ayub, while speaking in the National Assembly, said that stronger institutions were essential for the progress, prosperity, and development of the country.\nHe urged the government to convene a meeting of the Council of Common Interests (CCI) and ensure the rule of law across the country.\nAyub also called on the federal government to fulfil its commitment to provide a 3% share of the National Finance Commission (NFC) Award to the merged districts of the former FATA.\nRegarding the appointment of the Chief Election Commissioner, he said that he had also written a letter on the matter, stressing that an independent Election Commission was crucial for ensuring free and fair elections in the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
