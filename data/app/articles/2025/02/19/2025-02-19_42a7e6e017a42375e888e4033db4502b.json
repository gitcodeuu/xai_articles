Planting trees is one such investment that benefits not only today’s generation but also safeguards the resources and environment for future generations,” she remarked.\nShe specifically highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate tree species for urban areas like Islamabad, where maintaining environmental balance is essential. “The trees planted in the capital should be species suited to the local environment. Invasive species have caused negative effects, including health problems for residents,” she noted.\nThe Coordinator applauded the RCCI for organizing plantation drives and various environmental awareness activities, emphasizing that these efforts are a vital part of Pakistan’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions.\n“The contribution of private sectors, including businesses, is indispensable to combating climate change. Such initiatives are key steps towards reducing the harmful effects of carbon emissions and fostering a cleaner, greener Pakistan,” she stated.\nRomina Khurshid Alam also elaborated on the long-term benefits of plantation, stressing that the actions taken today will have lasting effects on environmental sustainability. “The trees we plant today will leave a lasting legacy for the next generations as plantation is the foundation for their future, and these trees will help combat climate change, improve air quality, and contribute to biodiversity,” she explained.\nRomina also reflected on the unusual weather patterns that Pakistan has been facing. “This year, we are experiencing the longest dry spell, and for the first time, we are witnessing a winter without rain in Islamabad. This unusual climate event is a stark reminder of the changing weather patterns and the urgent need for action,” she stated.\nRomina Khurshid highlighted the need for regional approaches to address climate vulnerabilities. “We must focus on regional strategies tailored to the specific needs and challenges of countries like Pakistan, in addition to global solutions,” she stated.\nThe plantation drive witnessed widespread participation of the diplomats, business community and civil society.\nThe event is seen as a positive step toward environmental conservation and a green, sustainable future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
