He noted that Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif was currently visiting Central Asian nations to explore further business prospects.\nHe emphasized the need for expanding port capacities in the country, stating that instead of handling four containers, ports should be capable of accommodating ships carrying up to 20,000 containers.\nHe further said that Pakistan was attracting significant interest from global maritime companies and investors. He pointed out that while some nations generate 40 percent of their GDP from the maritime sector, the global average contribution of the maritime industry to GDP is 7 percent. Pakistan, too, can achieve a 5 percent GDP contribution from this sector.\nRegarding fisheries exports, he noted that Pakistan currently earns $400 million from seafood exports, whereas neighboring countries were far ahead in this industry. He revealed that global companies were showing keen interest in investing in country’s fisheries sector.\nHe added that efforts were underway to upgrade the Korangi Fish Harbor, and investment was being made in constructing new auction halls to improve facilities.\nThe minister also announced that the present government had decided that 60 percent of all official imports and exports will be routed through Gwadar Port. He emphasized that Gwadar Port must be upgraded with world-class facilities to establish it as a modern and fully operational deep-sea port.\nQaiser concluded by stating that this workshop would play a vital role in advancing the maritime sector and fostering business growth. He reiterated that the government’s committees and task forces were actively working on maritime policy development.\nIn closing, he assured that Pakistan’s maritime industry will prove to be a key milestone in strengthening the country’s economy in the future.\nThe Ministry of Maritime Affairs organized the National Maritime Policy Workshop 2025, and provided a significant platform for discussion, collaboration, and cooperation on marine pollution control, marine tourism, expansion of blue economy, maritime security, and international cooperation.\nThe workshop facilitated and brought together government officials, industrialists, maritime experts, and international stakeholders to deliberate on the implementation of the recently launched National Maritime Policy (NMP) 2025 and its role in driving the country’s maritime sector forward.\nThe workshop focused on key environmental challenges and marine pollution control measures, emphasizing Pakistan’s commitment to MARPOL 73/78 and the Ballast Water Management Convention.\nParticipants discussed the enforcement of industrial waste treatment regulations, stricter monitoring of offshore waste disposal, and digital pollution tracking systems at ports. The expansion of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) to 30 percent of Pakistan’s Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and strengthening the National Marine Disaster Contingency Plan (NMDCP) were also highlighted as critical measures to safeguard marine ecosystems.\nThe workshop reemphasized the expansion of Pakistan’s blue economy, with detailed discussions on shipbuilding, offshore renewable energy, deep-sea exploration, aquaculture, and marine biotechnology.\nOfficials reaffirmed Pakistan’s goal of increasing its merchant fleet share from 12 percent to 30 percent by 2047 and enhancing Gwadar Port’s capacity as a regional trade hub under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and global maritime networks. The development of shipyards at Gwadar and Port Qasim was recognized as a strategic initiative to strengthen Pakistan’s shipbuilding and repair industry, contributing to national economic growth and job creation.\nThe development of marine and coastal tourism was another key area of discussion.\nExperts outlined strategies to secure Blue Flag certification for Pakistan’s beaches, promote eco-tourism, and attract private sector investment in sustainable tourism infrastructure. The policy’s focus on enhancing ferry services and improving connectivity between coastal cities was identified as a significant step toward making the country a competitive destination for maritime tourism.\nPakistan’s commitment to international maritime cooperation, stronger engagement with IMO and other global maritime organizations were deliberated at length through this workshop.\nFurthermore, it also highlighted in promoting regional maritime trade and security and aimed at enhancing economic collaboration among Pakistan and other countries.
