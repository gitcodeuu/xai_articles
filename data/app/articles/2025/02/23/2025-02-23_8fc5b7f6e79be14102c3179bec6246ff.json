  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 23 (APP):Director General of the Pakistan Halal Authority (PHA), Akhtar A. Bughio, on Sunday said that authority was committed to strengthening its halal certification framework to align with global standards.\nTalking to a PTV news, he said that the role of PHA in ensuring that all consumables, including cosmetics and processed goods, are free from non-halal ingredients through a rigorous verification process.\nHe said that PHA was dedicated to his role to identify halal products and certify and mark those products so that consumers have complete assurance regarding their purchases.\nAnswering a question, he said that Muslim-majority countries assume locally available products are halal, but the global market requires proper certification to verify authenticity. Where, Non-Muslim countries have significantly contributed to the halal market and have captured a major share. Pakistan, despite entering the sector later, is now actively working to streamline certification processes to align with global practices, he added.\nHe further said that modern food processing methods raise questions about the traceability and source of ingredients.\nThe PHA ensures that no haram substances are present in certified products through a rigorous verification system. The authority integrates technology with religious principles to maintain credibility, he added.\nHe also highlighted the issue of self-claimed halal products, noting that some entities falsely label products as halal. To counter this, PHA has established a facilitation center where consumers can verify product certification.\nAnswering a question regarding international collaboration, he said that Pakistan has initiated agreements with global halal certification bodies, including those in the United States and Russia. Recently, an MoU was signed with Turkey during President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s visit to Pakistan, strengthening bilateral cooperation in the halal sector.\nHe further stated that authority plans to launch a halal certification mobile application within the next six months. The app will allow consumers to scan QR codes on products to instantly verify their halal status, including certification details and production origin.\nHe added that PHA is actively engaging with local and international halal bodies and has partnered with 17 organizations, including universities and technology institutes, to enhance research and training in halal certification.\nHe expressed pride in the organization’s structured recruitment and training processes, ensuring that young professionals are well-equipped to contribute to the sector.\nThe director general was committed to adopt international best practices to strengthen its halal certification framework, ensuring transparency and credibility in the global halal market.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
