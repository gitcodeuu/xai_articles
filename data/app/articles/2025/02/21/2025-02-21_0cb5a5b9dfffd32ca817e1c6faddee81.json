  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 21 (APP):The recent collaboration between National Skills University Islamabad (NSU) and Rescue 1122 in hosting a life-saving Occupational Health and Safety Training Workshop in Islamabad highlights the critical need for preparedness in both professional and everyday settings.\nThe workshop, organized by the NSU’s Department of Electrical Engineering Technology, provided participants hands-on training in Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (CPR), First Aid, and Fire Extinguisher usage.\nThese are occupational skills and fundamental life-saving techniques that can mean the difference between life and death in critical situations.\nNSU’s initiative is a model for integrating safety into the educational framework in a country where workplace safety often takes a backseat to production goals, and the practicality of the workshop ensures its effectiveness.\n“Ensuring safety is not just about compliance; it’s about saving lives,” said Mr. Waqas, Chief Instructor from Rescue 1122. This sentiment is particularly relevant in high-risk fields like electrical engineering, where exposure to electrical shocks, fire hazards, and equipment malfunctions is an inherent reality.\nThe workshop provided a stark reminder that safety training should not be an afterthought; it should be embedded within professional education and workplace culture.\nParticipants walked away with more than certificates; they gained confidence in responding effectively to emergencies.\nThey acquired specific skills such as CPR, first aid, and fire extinguisher techniques.\nDr. Waqas Arif, an Assistant Professor at NSU, encapsulated the experience succinctly: “This workshop has been an eye-opener. Learning these techniques will not only help us in our professional careers but also enable us to assist others in everyday emergencies.”\nPakistan’s emergency response services have been reactive rather than preventive for years.\nThe partnership between NSU and Rescue 1122 represents a shift towards a more proactive approach, focusing on education and training to prevent workplace accidents before they happen.\nThis proactive approach is about fulfilling regulatory requirements and instilling a culture of preparedness that extends beyond institutional walls, inspiring and motivating others to follow.\nMore institutions, particularly those in technical and high-risk fields, should follow NSU’s lead in embedding health and safety training into their curricula.\nAs students, educators, and professionals, your active participation in promoting safety training is crucial. Public-private partnerships, like the one demonstrated here, can play a pivotal role in addressing Pakistan’s workplace safety challenges.\nLooking ahead, NSU and Rescue 1122 have signaled their intent to continue collaborating on safety training programs, workshops, and community outreach initiatives.\nThis commitment is commendable, but it must be sustained and expanded. A safer workforce is a more resilient workforce, and in a rapidly evolving industrial landscape, resilience is the key to progress.\nAt a time when the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), characterized by the fusion of technologies and the blurring of lines between the physical, digital, and biological spheres, is reshaping job markets and industries, it is paramount to ensure that workers are equipped not only with technical skills but also with essential safety training.\nAccording to Prof. Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar, NSU’s vision to integrate such training into its academic programs aligns with this new reality, ensuring that graduates are job-ready and socially responsible citizens.\nHe praised the efforts of Prof. Dr. Ishtiaq Ahmad and his team in organizing this event.\nThe collaboration between NSU and Rescue 1122 is a model for what workplace safety initiatives should look practical, accessible, and impactful.\nIt is a step towards a future where safety is not an afterthought but a fundamental component of education and professional development. In that future, lives will be saved not by chance but by preparedness\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
