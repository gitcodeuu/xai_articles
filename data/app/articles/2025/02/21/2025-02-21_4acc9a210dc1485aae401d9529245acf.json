Pakistan wants mutual respect for the sovereignty, independence and integrity of every country.”\nTo a question, he said Iran was a responsible country and there should be no presumptions about their nuclear programme.\nResponding to a question, he said Pakistan would retaliate to an attack from any neighbouring country as it had done so on two occasions.\nHe said terrorists of Fitna Al-Khawarij were based in border areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan.\n“We are well wishers of Afghanistan and wished them prosperity. However, we wanted assurance from the Afghan authorities that their soil will be not used against Pakistan.”\nPakistan shared common religion, culture and history with Afghanistan and would continue to give all assistance to the land-locked country, he added.\nTalking about Afghan refugees, he said different countries decided to take in Afghan refugees living in Pakistan tentatively by the month of September.\n“If it does not happen the refugees will be illegal for Pakistan which may be forced to send them back.”\nIshaq Dar said Pakistan suffered losses of $150 billion in the war against terrorism and more than three million Afghan refugees were a burden for the country.\nHe was of the view that the United States during its withdrawal from Afghanistan should not have left weapons and ammunition which came in access of terrorist outfits.\nHe said Pakistan was raising voice against Islamophobia at every forum, adding the OIC secretary general appointed a permanent representative on Islamophobia who had been voicing the issue at all forums.\nA special day would be observed in the UN General Assembly on March 15 on the issue of Islamophobia, he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
