  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 21 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday inaugurated the Case Assignments and Management System (CAMS), a transformative initiative designed to provide transparent, efficient, and speedy justice for litigants.\nDuring the launching ceremony, the prime minister highlighted the long-standing demand from applicants and litigants for a more transparent and timely justice system, which CAMS is set to address.\n“Case Assignments and Management System was long overdue because litigants and applicants from all over the country wanted transparent and speedy justice and this initiative will go a long way to address their grievances and provide justice in a reasonable time frame,” the prime minister said while addressing the inauguration ceremony held here.\nHe also thanked the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crimes (UNODC) and Canadian High Commission for providing funds for the project.\nThe prime minister mentioned that although, in the past, a track and trace system was introduced in the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), it did not yield the desired results and ultimately failed. However, he emphasized that due to his personal involvement, the current government had successfully launched an effective and efficient system that was now benefiting the people of Pakistan.\n“FBR is now having a trial run of faceless interaction at Karachi port, and once it is fully operational, it will then be replicated at various sea ports, dry ports and other places all over the country,” he added.\nHe regretted that trillions of rupees had delayed for decades due to corruption and lack of modern technology techniques.\n“I have been personally following this,” he said adding that a couple of days, he also met Chief Justice of Pakistan (CJP) to request him ensuring speedy decisions on merit because trillions of rupees worth cases were pending at the tribunal level, at higher forums, high court, and supreme court.\nThe prime minister pointed out that Pakistan was meant to lead many nations due to its tremendous natural and human resources.\n“What has been lacking is ‘will to do’, had we utilized these factors earlier, Pakistan would have been transformed long ago.”\nThe prime minister expressed his resolve to recover each and every penny that was due for the betterment of the people of Pakistan. He mentioned that after making mechanism functional, an amount of Rs 24 billion was adjudicated by the Sindh High Court on merit and this money will now be deposited in the national exchequer.\nMinister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, on the occasion informed that 98.5% of the federal government’s official work was now conducted through technology via the e-business portal.\nHe said the prime minister had always expressed concern over delays in the judicial system, and now the federal laws had been put on a mobile app, ensuring amendments were updated swiftly. “Our response time for amendments is now just 48 hours,” he added.\nCountry Representative of UNODC Troels Vester highlighted that the Office was committed to improving the justice system by making it faster, more efficient, and fairer for all through effective oversight mechanisms.\nHe extended appreciation to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership in driving government reforms, particularly in modernizing Pakistan’s justice sector.\nHe said this launch aligned directly with the Prime Minister’s e-office initiative, and the UNODC was grateful for the support from the Ministry of Law and Justice and its team, whose hard work had turned this vision into reality.\nHigh Commissioner of Canada to Pakistan Leslie Scanlon said this milestone was significant for the Ministry of Law and Justice and showcased how Pakistan’s government was embracing automation, promoting digitalization, and fostering transparency. Additionally, she said it also highlighted the government’s commitment to environmental conservation by reducing paper waste.\nThe prime minister also presented certificates of appreciation to the team members for their hard work.",
