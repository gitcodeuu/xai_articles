In total, 50+ potential startups were showcased before the industry professionals, and venture capitalists.\nRenowned academician, scholar and former Executive Director HEC Dr. Sohail Naqvi was chief guest in the opening ceremony.\nIn his address, Dr. Naqi said that universities serve as the core institutions for driving change and progress in society.\n“Each university has to function as an engine of growth, embrace the transformative power of innovation-led technology and align it with the specific needs of their respective regions to drive meaningful progress and sustainable growth. Nevertheless innovation, by its very nature, requires individuals to challenge conventional norms and think beyond the ordinary. It involves going against the stream, pushing boundaries, and embracing risks.”\nDr. Sohail Naqvi emphasized that while research lays the foundation for discovery, its application is equally important. “Practical implementation of research findings ensures that knowledge is not confined to academic circles but contributes meaningfully to economic and technological advancements. For innovation to flourish, individuals must be given the freedom and space to explore, experiment, and create without unnecessary constraints. To build a prosperous future, society must recognize that the true pathway to success is the application of innovation.”\nIn his welcome address, Chairman HEC Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed extended a warm welcome to the distinguished guests and valued participants of ICE25.\nHe briefly shared the journey of HEC’s efforts to promote innovation and entrepreneurship culture in the higher education sector. He said that HEC, in partnership with all stakeholders, is committed to encourage and facilitate the development of entrepreneurial ecosystem in the country.\nThe Chairman HEC expressed hope that this event would serve as a significant milestone in laying the foundation for a transformative shift in the culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, fostering creativity, collaboration, and sustainable growth.\nMr. Najy Benhassine, World Bank’s Country Director for Pakistan during his remarks said that the potential for innovation and economic growth exists, but it can only be fully realized by effectively linking key stakeholders.“Collaboration among stakeholders is essential to creating an ecosystem where ideas can develop into successful ventures. However, for progress to be meaningful, it must also be sustainable. True, long-term growth comes not just from existing industries but from the emergence of new companies that bring fresh ideas, solutions, and opportunities to the market.”\nHe hoped that this event will support budding entrepreneurs, providing them with the resources, guidance, and investment needed to turn their visions into reality.\nAn insightful keynote by Dr. Naveed Ahmed Sherwani, CEO of RapidSilicon on “Pakistan’s Startup Landscape – Opportunities and Challenges”, shed light on emerging investment trends and the potential for high-growth startups in the country by comparing it with global benchmarks\nThe event also hosted two engaging panel discussions: (i) “Incubators as Catalysts for Startup Success: Beyond Seed Funding”, where experts deliberated on the role of incubators in nurturing sustainable businesses, and (ii) “Deep Tech and Beyond: Investing in the Next Wave of Disruptive Innovations”, focusing on the importance of deep tech investments and emerging trends in venture capital.\nAdding up, a Fireside Chat titled “Are You Investable for a VC?” provided the participants with firsthand insights from prominent venture capitalists on what makes a startup attractive for investment.\nThe event concluded with Investor Connect: One-on-One Office Hours, where startups engaged in direct discussions with investors, further strengthening networking and collaboration opportunities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
