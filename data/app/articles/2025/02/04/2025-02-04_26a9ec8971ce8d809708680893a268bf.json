The Kashmir issue must be resolved in accordance with UN resolutions,” he stated.\nSpeaking on the occasion, NLPD Executive Director Dr Rashid Hameed highlighted that the partition of the subcontinent remains an incomplete agenda since Kashmir was neither geographically nor culturally a part of India.\nHe pointed out that the ongoing tensions between Pakistan and India stem from this unresolved dispute.\n“Pakistan has a firm stance against India’s oppression and exploitation in Kashmir. We remain hopeful that the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people will not go in vain and that one day, Kashmir will achieve freedom,” he remarked.\nThe event concluded with prayers for the martyrs of Kashmir and the liberation of the region.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
