  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 6 (APP): Experts on Friday advised the masses to consume meat in moderation on the occasion of Eid-ul-Azha to prevent health issues.\nDuring this period, the consumption of meat increases significantly, which can sometimes lead to health complications if precautions are not observed, they told APP.\nDr. Arooj Ejaz, MBBS, M.Sc. in Nutrition and Consultant Nutritionist at Medics Hospital Islamabad, highlighted several important guidelines.\nShe recommended that after an animal is sacrificed, one should wait at least 30 minutes before processing the meat.\n“This allows the muscles to relax and initial blood to drain properly, enhancing both the quality and safety of the meat,” she explained.\nDr. Arooj also stressed the importance of cleaning the meat with potable water to remove blood, dirt, and debris. However, she advised against excessive soaking, which can promote bacterial growth.\nWhile red meat is a valuable source of protein, iron, zinc, and B vitamins, excessive consumption — particularly over a short span — can overwhelm the body.\n“Large portions of fatty cuts contribute to high saturated fat intake, which can raise cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease,” she warned.\nDr. Arooj further cautioned that over consumption of meat can slow digestion, causing bloating, constipation and indigestion, advising to take 8 – 10 glasses of water per day for better digestive system.\nThese problems are often worsened when meals lack adequate fiber from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains, she added.\nShe also highlighted that a high-protein load puts additional strain on the liver and kidneys, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes.\n“Many patients tend to forget their dietary restrictions during Eid,” she noted, adding that overeating red meat can significantly worsen existing health issues, which might also result in hospitalization.\nDespite the festive atmosphere and the fact that meat consumption during Bakra Eid is higher than usual, it is important for people to remain mindful. Moderation and proper precautions are strongly advised to enjoy the festival without compromising health.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
