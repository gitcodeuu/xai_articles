Pakistan stands in solidarity with the people and the Government of Lebanon, during this difficult time.\n“We urge the international community, particularly the United Nations and ceasefire mediators, to take immediate action to hold Israeli occupying forces accountable and prevent further escalation,” the foreign office spokesperson said adding that Pakistan remains firmly committed to peace, justice, and the principles of international law.",
