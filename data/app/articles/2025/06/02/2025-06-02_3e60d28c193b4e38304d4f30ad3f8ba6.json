The only way to protect children is through repeated doses of the oral polio vaccine for all children under five as well as the timely completion of all vaccines offered as part of the essential immunization schedule.\nThe Programme is calling on all parents to ensure their children do not miss out on any opportunity to receive polio drops.\nEvery dose of polio vaccine provides an opportunity to further strengthen immunity and protection against lifelong paralysis. With polio still a threat, community support is vital—no child should be missed.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
