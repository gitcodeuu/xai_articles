  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 02 (APP): Capital Development Authority (CDA) has announced sweeping measures against illegal housing and cooperative societies operating in the federal capital.\nThe decision was made during a high-level meeting chaired by CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, on Monday.\nSenior officials including CDA board members, planning directors, and enforcement officers attended the session.\nIt was decided that the CDA will immediately publish a comprehensive list of unauthorized housing societies in major newspapers and on its official website. “We want every citizen to easily verify a society’s legal status before investing their hard-earned money,” stated a CDA spokesperson.\nAuthorities have imposed a complete ban on construction material sales to illegal societies.\nBuilding material suppliers must now verify a society’s approved layout plan and valid No-Objection Certificate (NOC) before any transaction. Violators will face strict legal consequences.\nThe crackdown particularly targets societies involved in illegal plot transfers and those avoiding mandatory CDA transfer fees. “These unauthorized developments not only cheat investors but also create urban planning nightmares,” explained the spokesperson.\nThe measures come after increasing complaints about fraudulent housing schemes cheating thousands of citizens.\nThe CDA urges the public to always cross-check any property investment through their official channels before making payments.\nFor verification of housing societies and regular updates, citizens can visit the CDA’s official website or contact their helpline.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
