We cannot allow valuable port land, which holds tremendous economic potential, to remain encroached or underutilized,” said Minister Chaudhry. “It is imperative that both PQA and KPT work together to enforce land protection measures, implement digital transparency, and enable private sector investment through proper planning and legal frameworks.”\nManagement of the Port Qasim Authority briefed the Minister on the ongoing initiatives being undertaken as part of a new comprehensive masterplan. This masterplan will include the regularization and optimal use of leftover pockets of land, reclaimed areas, and currently non-utilized plots. These spaces are intended to be repurposed for high-value investment, commercial use, and strategic infrastructure development aligned with national economic priorities.\nA significant highlight of the meeting was the PQA’s plan to introduce a digital land automation system, a standalone module that will bring transparency, traceability, and operational efficiency to land management. The system will be fully integrated with the PQA Port ERP system, enabling seamless data synchronization, digital record-keeping, and real-time decision-making.\nThe Karachi Port Trust (KPT) management also presented their updates and reaffirmed their commitment to addressing the issue of encroachment on port land.\nThe KPT officials informed the Federal Minister that enforcement actions are already underway and that the Trust is closely collaborating with the Survey of Pakistan, which is actively conducting a detailed land demarcation survey to accurately identify and map the boundaries of KPT land holdings. This demarcation exercise is expected to pave the way for stronger legal action against encroachments and provide a foundation for more informed land-use planning.\nMinister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry lauded both authorities for their ongoing efforts but reiterated the urgency of translating planning into tangible results.\nThe Minister also expressed his resolve to personally oversee the progress of these initiatives and announced that monthly review meetings will be held to monitor implementation and resolve inter-agency bottlenecks. He urged all maritime stakeholders to align their activities with the national vision of sustainable port development and economic resilience.\n“The maritime sector holds the key to transforming Pakistan into a regional trade and logistics hub. Unlocking the potential of port land through strategic reforms, enforcement, and digitization is a top priority of our ministry,” said the Minister.\nThe meeting concluded with a commitment from both PQA and KPT leadership to work in unison toward a modern, secure, and investment-ready port infrastructure framework.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
