  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 13 (APP): Federal Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhary on Friday praised Pakistan’s strong and timely response to India on May 10, saying it improved the country’s international image further and boosted the confidence of overseas Pakistanis.\nSpeaking in the National Assembly during the debate on the 2025-26 budget, Dr. Fazal said that Pakistan’s desire for peace should not be seen as weakness.\nHe warned that if India takes any aggressive step again, Pakistan will respond even more forcefully. “Ceasefire does not mean the threat is over—we are always ready,” he added.\nHe strongly criticized Indian politicians and media for spreading false propaganda about Pakistan, especially in light of recent tensions. “Let it be clear—this is not a peace deal, only a ceasefire. If India repeats its mistake, we are fully prepared,” he said.\nDr. Tariq Fazal urged the nation to remain united, describing Pakistan’s strength as a solid wall in difficult times. “We must speak with one voice and stand together to defend our country,” he said, adding that the people and armed forces are committed to protecting Pakistan’s honor.\nHe credited Allah Almighty for guiding the country and acknowledged the role of political leaders, the military, and citizens in raising Pakistan’s reputation globally.\nHe shared how overseas Pakistanis had told him they once felt hesitant while showing their passports, but that has changed after May 10. “Now, our passport is seen with respect at immigration,” he said.\nDr. Tariq Fazal stressed that respect must be earned through actions, not just words. He criticized Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for promoting extremist ideology and said that Pakistan has always called for peace but will never allow aggression to go unanswered.\nTalking about the internal situation, Dr. Tariq Fazal said Pakistan is going through a sensitive phase, and unity is more important than ever.\nHe criticized the opposition for focusing on minor issues instead of serious economic and security matters.\nHe accused opposition parties of playing politics instead of helping the country in difficult times, especially regarding security challenges involving the Taliban and tensions with India. “They crossed the line between fair criticism and harming national interest,” he said.\nHe called for harmony among institutions and urged everyone to present a united front. “This is the time to show the world we are united.,” he added.\nDr. Tariq Fazal expressed disappointment that while the international community praised Pakistan’s diplomatic response, some voices inside the country were still critical.\nHe urged Parliament to act responsibly and protect national unity during times of regional stress. “The world is watching—we must not doubt our own people,” he said.\nHe praised the success of Pakistan’s anti-terror operations, saying India’s recent aggression was an attempt to sabotage Pakistan’s action in eliminating terrorist networks.\nThe Minister said the campaign against terrorism would continue until the last terrorist is eliminated. “This is a long-term mission, not a one-time effort,” he stressed.\nOn the economy, he highlighted the positive role of overseas Pakistanis. He credited Prime Minister for encouraging legal remittances and cracking down on black money.\n“In March 2025 alone, we received over $4 billion, and total remittances reached nearly $34.9 billion,” he said, calling it proof of overseas Pakistanis’ trust in Pakistan’s leadership.\nHe also appreciated the government’s efforts to improve peace, security, and the investment environment.\nThe Minister highlighted the Overseas Investment Conference and other steps taken to build trust with investors. “We are committed to rebuilding the economy through transparency and strong governance,” he said.\nDefending the recent salary adjustments for MNAs, he said there had been no increase for 15–16 years, unlike regular annual raises for government employees. “This isn’t about privilege—it’s about fairness,” he said, adding that lawmakers also deserve support to meet rising living costs.\nHe described the federal budget as a shared document for all citizens, not just a few. “This is a people’s budget. Every decision has been made in the national interest,” he said.\nHe welcomed the plan to form a suggestions and recommendations committee to gather feedback and improve the budget.\nDr. Tariq Fazal said Pakistan had shown great strength after May 10 and is now moving forward with a renewed sense of unity and purpose.\nHe urged political parties to put aside personal rivalries for the good of the country. “Let’s not allow politics to divide us. Now is the time to build, to unite, and to show the world what Pakistan stands for,” he said.\nReferring to Pakistan’s role in the region, he said the country has proven its importance and should now work towards becoming the progressive and self-reliant nation that thinker like Allama Iqbal dreamed of.\nDr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhary warned that any attempt by India to block Pakistan’s water share under the Indus Waters Treaty would be treated as a hostile act — equal to a declaration of war.\nHe explained that the Indus Waters Treaty, signed in 1960 with the support of international guarantors, had two options at the time: dividing water by percentage or allocating entire rivers. To avoid future disputes, both countries, with the help of global experts, agreed that three rivers — Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab — would go to Pakistan, and the other three — Ravi, Sutlej, and Beas — would go to India.\n“This agreement was made to ensure long-term peace and clarity. The treaty is internationally recognized and legally binding. Any violation, especially blocking Pakistan’s share, will be considered an act of war,” he warned.\nDr. Tariq Fazal said Pakistan reserves every right — through diplomacy or other means — to respond if India violates the treaty. “We will not let such aggression succeed. Pakistan will act according to international law,” he said firmly.\nHe also pointed out that these rivers originate from Jammu and Kashmir, a region disputed between Pakistan and India. “India has no sole claim over these rivers. Kashmir is a disputed territory, and these rivers are not Indian property,” he said.\nReaffirming Pakistan’s position on Kashmir, Dr. Fazal said the region and its natural resources, including the rivers, do not belong to India. “These rivers rise from Kashmir, not India. The day Kashmir gains freedom, all six rivers will rightfully be Pakistan’s,” he added.\nTurning to Balochistan, Dr. Tariq Fazal said the current government is taking serious steps to address the province’s concerns, especially regarding fair resource distribution. “We are committed to peace in Balochistan and ensuring it receives its fair share of national development,” he said, stressing the importance of equity among provinces.\nHe accused India of supporting terrorism in Balochistan, particularly through backing the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). He said Indian-sponsored terrorists had even targeted schools in the province.\nDr. Fazal also condemned the recent Israeli attack on Iran, saying Pakistan stands in full solidarity with the Iranian people and government.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
