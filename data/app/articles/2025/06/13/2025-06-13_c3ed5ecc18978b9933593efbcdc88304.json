  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 13 (APP):The local administration carried out an anti-encroachment operation in Rawat Bazaar to clear blocked pathways.\nThe drive was led by Assistant Commissioner Rural, who was accompanied by teams from the relevant union councils.\nDuring the operation, illegally set-up stalls and temporary structures that were obstructing the main routes were removed. The administration said the purpose of the action was to ensure smooth pedestrian and vehicular movement in the busy market area.\nTeams moved through various parts of the bazaar, clearing footpaths and roadways that had been occupied by shopkeepers and vendors. The operation was conducted after repeated complaints from citizens about shrinking public space due to increasing encroachments in the area.\nThe Assistant Commissioner monitored the activity on-site and directed the teams to ensure that no part of the cleared area was reoccupied. He also warned vendors that further violations would result in stricter measures, including legal action and fines.\nThe local administration stated that such actions will continue in other commercial areas to improve public access and maintain order. Authorities also urged traders to cooperate with the teams and avoid extending their businesses beyond the allotted spaces.\nThis operation in Rawat is part of a wider campaign by the Islamabad district administration to tackle encroachments across the capital’s rural zones.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
