The victim sustained two gunshot wounds to the chest and was shifted to a hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.\nHe said Sana’s mother added that the suspect could be identified if presented before her.\nHe said Sana Yousaf, a native of Chitral, had around 800,000 followers on TikTok and over 500,000 on Instagram. At the time of the attack, she was at home with her aunt, while her mother was at the market, her father at work, and her younger brother in Chitral.\nIG Rizvi, speaking to the media, said the attacker had posed as a guest to gain entry into the house before committing the murder.\nHe said after registering the case, police launched a swift investigation and apprehended the accused, Umar Hayat alias “Kaka,” from Faisalabad within 20 hours.\nHe said investigations revealed that the suspect had tried to befriend Sana and, after repeated rejections, planned the attack. He added that the police recovered the murder weapon and the victim’s iPhone, which the suspect had taken to destroy evidence.\nIG Rizvi said, “This is a case of repeated rejection. The accused made multiple attempts to contact the victim and stalked her persistently.”\nIG Rizvi said the suspect had remained outside the victim’s house for over eight hours on May 29, her birthday, attempting to meet her. On June 2, after spending several more hours trying to contact her, he executed his plan and shot her.\nIG Rizvi said the Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi remained in constant contact during the investigation and issued timely directives. The Islamabad Police kept him regularly updated.\nIG Rizvi said seven police teams led by DIG Tariq, SSP Investigation, SSP Operations, and DSP CIA played key roles in the investigation.
