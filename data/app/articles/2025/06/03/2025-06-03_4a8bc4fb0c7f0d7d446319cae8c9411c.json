The committee recommended that the ministry initiate criminal proceedings against OEPs involved in sending deportees abroad and provide details of OEPs who sent the maximum number of Pakistanis abroad who have been found involved in beggary and other criminal activities.\nThe committee also sought segregated data of 5,000 deportees who went abroad on permit and visit visa to determine the role of OEPs in the matter. Officials from the Interior Ministry stated that around 58,000 Pakistanis have been deported since 2023, with 5,600 deported on account of beggary from Saudi Arabia, Oman, and Qatar.\nThe committee was also briefed about the economic diplomacy to increase migration of skilled labor abroad. The Managing Director of the Overseas Employment Corporation (OEC) informed the committee that around 10.3 million Pakistani skilled workers are employed in various countries, and OEC has MoUs with 18 countries.\nThe committee appreciated the work done by OEC and decided to pay a visit to laboratories established by OEC in the upcoming meeting. The committee also sought a report from the DG Passport and Immigration regarding 24,000 speaking orders issued to facilitate deportees during the last three months.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
