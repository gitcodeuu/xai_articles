  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 03 (APP): The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) will expand their joint efforts to treat children suffering from severe acute malnutrition in Pakistan.\nThis was stated by BISP Chairperson Senator Rubina Khalid and WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo during visit to nutrition stabilization centre (NSC) at the Federal Government Polyclinic hospital.\nThey said each year, the partnership helps around 43,000 children under the age of two who have medical complications caused by malnutrition.\nThey added these children are treated at 169 nutrition stabilization centres (NSCs) across the country.\nSenator Rubina Khalid said, “We want to make sure no mother or child is left behind. Healthy mothers and children are the foundation of a strong Pakistan.”\nShe said that under the Benazir Nashonuma programme, WHO-supported centres funded by BISP have treated 46,000 children since 2022 and given counselling to more than 64,000 mothers and caregivers.\nShe said that in 2025, the number of centres will increase to 199, aiming to treat 80,000 children and counsel 120,000 mothers each year.\nDr. Luo praised the programme’s success, highlighting a 98% cure rate — well above the global standard of 75%.\nHe said that Pakistan is still facing serious challenges with child nutrition as about 40% of children under five are stunted and nearly 18% suffer from wasting.\nHe said that climate change is making the situation worse. He added malnutrition is also causing an estimated $17 billion in economic losses each year, or 6.4% of Pakistan’s Gross National Income.\nHe said thar WHO will continue to work with BISP, the government, and other UN agencies like WFP and UNICEF to detect malnutrition early and provide life-saving support.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
