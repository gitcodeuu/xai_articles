  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 3 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has inaugurated the 300 kW solarization project at KPT Izhar Abbasi Hospital in Karachi on Tuesday.\nThe initiative, implemented at a cost of Rs 31.83 million, aims to reduce the hospital’s dependence on fossil fuels and address the worsening issue of climate change.\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by senior officials including members of the KPT Trustees (Transition Committee), General Manager Engineering, Rear Admiral Habib Ur Rehman, Rear Admiral Atiq-ur-Rehman (GM Operations), Brigadier Muhammad Younis (GM Administration), and other key leadership from the Ministry and Karachi Port Trust (KPT).\nAddressing the event as a chief guest, Federal Minister Junaid Anwar said KPT hospital solarization is milestone in national sustainability efforts. He emphasised the urgent need to transition to clean energy, especially in essential public service institutions like hospitals.\n“The solarization of the hospital is not only a solution to persistent power outages in Keamari but also a strategic move to reduce its carbon footprint,” the minister added. “Generators running on fossil fuels consume up to 5,000 litres of fuel monthly, contributing heavily to carbon emissions and climate degradation.”\nHighlighting the project’s broader significance, the minister noted that this effort aligns with the government’s Climate Change Policy and is part of Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif’s directive to transition government facilities to renewable energy sources.\n“Solarization will result in Rs 21.6 million in annual savings and a substantial reduction in carbon emissions, providing both environmental and economic benefits,” he added.\nThe 25-year lifecycle of the solar project comes with minimal maintenance costs of Rs 450,000 annually, making it a cost-effective and environmentally responsible initiative. The minister stressed that such projects not only combat climate change but also contribute to national self-reliance and economic resilience.\nAmidst rising temperatures and an ongoing heatwave — clear manifestations of global climate change — the minister reiterated the government’s commitment to sustainable energy solutions and urged other public institutions to follow suit.\nFollowing the ceremony, Federal Minister Junaid Anwar toured the hospital, visiting patients in various wards and reaffirming the government’s dedication to improving public healthcare infrastructure through environmentally sustainable means.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
