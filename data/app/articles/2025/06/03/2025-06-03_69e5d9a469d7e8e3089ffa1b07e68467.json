  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 03 (APP): A recent university campaign organized by the Institute of Urbanism (IoU) in collaboration with the International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI) and the Prime Minister Green Youth Movement Club IIUI has drawn attention to the dangers of open waste burning (OWB) and promoted eco-friendly alternatives.\nThe event, titled “Let’s Learn Why Not to Burn,” brought together experts, environmental regulators and youth activists to discuss the severe environmental and health risks posed by OWB.\nIslamabad produces more than 1,575 tons of waste daily, with a large amount left uncollected, particularly in non-sector areas. Much of this waste is either dumped openly or illegally burned, releasing toxic pollutants and greenhouse gases.\nDr Irfan Khan, Retired Dean of Basic & Applied Sciences, warned, “Burning waste emits harmful substances that can cause respiratory diseases and even cancer. This practice damages both public health and the environment.”\nDr Ejaz Ahmad, Executive Director of IoU, stressed the importance of education and research in tackling the issue. “Universities must lead in innovation and advocacy to promote sustainable waste management,” he said.\nMr Ashiq Nawaz from Pak-EPA acknowledged enforcement challenges, stating, “Open burning is banned, but weak implementation and lack of awareness hinder progress.”\nMeanwhile, Afsheen Tajamal of 2Insects presented entrepreneurial models that convert waste into useful resources.\nYouth engagement was a key focus, with Dr Hafiz Ghufran Ahmad and Dr. Hafiz Muhammad Naseer emphasizing the role of young people in driving sustainable change.\n“Pakistan’s youth can lead the shift toward cleaner cities through innovation and activism,” Naseer said.\nThe campaign called for stronger policies, public awareness, and community-driven solutions to curb open waste burning and adopt greener alternatives.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
