The intense heatwave currently affecting many parts of the country is expected to gradually subside during the forecast period.\nThere is a risk of urban flooding in low-lying areas of Lahore, Rawalpindi, Gujranwala, and Islamabad during heavy downpours. Farmers are advised to manage their crop activities in line with the forecast.\nGeneral public, travelers, and tourists are urged to take precautionary measures and avoid unnecessary travel to vulnerable or flood-prone areas.\nThe PMD has advised all concerned authorities to remain on alert and take necessary measures to prevent any untoward situation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
