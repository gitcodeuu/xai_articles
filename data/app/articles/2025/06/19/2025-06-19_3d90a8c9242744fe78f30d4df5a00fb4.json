The discussion focused on the need to develop a national strategy for energy storage to improve energy security, reduce vulnerability to supply disruptions, and stabilize supply chains.\nThe event was opened by President IPRI, Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Majid Ehsan, HI(M), who spoke on the importance of policymaking in energy security and cooperation between public and private sectors. He noted that the launch of the study is part of ongoing efforts to support policy discussions and identify practical steps for the energy sector.\nThe keynote address was delivered by Ambassador Inam-ul-Haq, Chairman of the Board of Governors at IPRI. He said energy is a key strategic issue and called on policymakers and industry professionals to focus on energy storage as a necessary part of Pakistan’s economic planning and national security.\nThe speaker panel included Brigadier Dr. Raashid Wali Janjua (Retd.), Director Research at IPRI; Mr. Shehryar Omar, CEO of the Petroleum Institute of Pakistan (PIP); and Mr. Muhammad Aamir Salim, Executive Director (Petroserv) at Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL).\nBrigadier Dr. Raashid Wali Janjua, while outlining the study’s main points, called it “a humble first step in the roadmap towards strategic storages.” He discussed the need for a policy approach that brings together long-term planning, technical input, and private-sector involvement to create oil and gas storage capacity.\nMr. Shehryar Omar shared an industry perspective, saying that “energy security is the cornerstone of national progress.” He noted that in a time of global change across political, economic, and technological areas, Pakistan must take steps to ensure continuous access to affordable energy.\nMr. Muhammad Aamir Salim spoke about trends in energy demand before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. “The energy demand came back post-COVID,” he said, explaining that demand fell during the pandemic and increased afterward, adding pressure to energy systems. He highlighted the role of strategic reserves in protecting against price changes and supply problems.\nThe research study is intended to support further discussion and provide recommendations for developing energy storage as part of Pakistan’s energy planning.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
