We have extended Afghan nationals access to our education system, healthcare and other social sectors, reflecting our firm commitment to empower them to contribute meaningfully in their country’s peace and development.”\n“We take pride in Afghan nationals excelling in sports and various professions, drawing on the education and training they received in Pakistan,” he added.\nThe prime minister said, “As they begin returning to their homeland, we are confident they will serve as a bridge of goodwill, further strengthening the enduring bonds of brotherhood between our two nations.”\n“On this occasion, let us recommit ourselves to the core values of humanity, compassion and international cooperation.\nThe refugees, their host communities and their countries of origin require continued solidarity and support through burden sharing and demonstrating international responsibility,” he continued.\nHe said, “Return of the refugees to their beloved homeland is the best and most durable solution that we must collectively strive to achieve.”\nHe commended the efforts of humanitarian workers, humanitarian organizations and especially UNHCR in providing assistance and protection to refugees and forcibly displaced persons despite enormous challenges.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
