  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 19 (APP):The Senate on Thursday passed the Civil Servants (Amendment) Bill, 2025, aimed at enhancing transparency and enabling public access to the asset declarations of senior government officials.\nThe bill, moved by Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar on behalf of Senator Ahmed Khan Cheema, Minister for Establishment, seeks to amend the Civil Servants Act, 1973, as reported by the Standing Committee.\nThe legislation is intended to further operationalize the Government Servants (Conduct) Rules, 1964—specifically Rules 12, 13, and 13-A—and align them with the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2017.\nUnder the proposed framework, asset declarations of officers in Basic Pay Scale (BPS) 17 to 22—including assets beneficially owned domestically or abroad by the officials or their family members—will be filed digitally and made publicly accessible.\nThe bill provides that sufficient safeguards will be ensured to protect sensitive personal information, such as national identity numbers, residential addresses, and bank or bond account numbers.\nThe Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) will maintain the digital platform, while the Establishment Division will be equipped with a robust framework, resources, and tools to conduct risk-based verifications of the submitted declarations.\nThe move is aimed at promoting transparency, strengthening public trust, and enhancing accountability across the federal bureaucracy.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
