He added that the Sukkur-Hyderabad Motorway has been divided into 5 zones. The Islamic Development Bank will finance three of these zones while funding for the remaining two will be sought from other banks or donor agency”.\nThe federal minister extended his thanks to the Chief Minister of Sindh and stated that the Federal Government would definitely not hesitate to request the Sindh Government’s contribution of PKR 25 billion, if needed. He affirmed the Federal Government’s desire to complete this USD 2 billion project as swiftly as possible through its own resources.\nMoreover, Abdul Aleem Khan stated that the National Highway Authority (NHA) is actively working on the Lyari Expressway. This project will also be upgraded to meet international standards and, upon completion will be presented as a gift to the people of Karachi.",
