  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 14 (APP):Federal Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Saturday called on the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to hold an emergency meeting to develop a joint strategy in response to Israel’s ongoing aggression.\nSpeaking in the National Assembly, the minister condemned Israel’s brutal actions, especially its military aggression against Iran.\nHe called it a serious threat to regional and global peace. “Palestinian children are being killed, yet there are more protests in non-Muslim countries than in Muslim nations,” he remarked with regret.\nHe said Iran is not just a neighbour but a brotherly country with deep-rooted ties with Pakistan.\nHe warned that if the Muslim world doesn’t act together, every country will eventually become a target. “The way Israel has targeted Yemen, Iran, and Palestine shows a larger plan. Most Muslim nations are already facing security risks. Strong leadership is needed now,” he said.\nKhawja Asif said, “Israel has innocent blood on its hands. Pakistan stands firmly with Iran and will continue to support it on international forums,” he said.\nThe minister referred to India’s recent aggression, saying it had faced consequences. “India’s false pride has been broken, and their leadership is now embarrassed at home. This was only possible due to our strong military and the unity of our people,” he said.\nHe praised the armed forces and the people for standing firm in the face of threats. “We proved to the world that Pakistan is not weak — not yesterday, not today,” he declared. He said enemies tried to weaken Pakistan, but their plans failed.\nHe highlighted how the world was closely watching Pakistan’s coastal borders during recent tensions, and how Pakistan’s armed forces defended the nation bravely. “Our navy’s response forced the enemy to retreat,” he said.\nThe defence minister said that while Pakistan’s military strength is commendable, the economy must also be strong.\nHe praised Pakistan’s youth, especially cyber experts, for delivering a strong blow to India during a recent cyber conflict. “Our young people shut down lights in stadiums, disrupted IPL matches, and even affected dams. Their skills surprised the world,” he said.\nHe added that the recent military operation Bunyanum Marsoos was a turning point, both strategically and for national morale. He said Pakistan’s response to Indian attacks was firm and timely. “We struck back with full force,” he said.\nKhawaja Asif also spoke about Pakistan’s sacrifices in the fight against terrorism. “Our soldiers and civilians have lost lives in attacks, especially in Balochistan. Groups like the TTP and BLA are fighting India’s war on our soil,” he claimed.\nHe strongly condemned anyone who supports these militants. “Such people are not Pakistanis. They are enemies of the country,” he said.\nHe insisted that while political problems should be solved through dialogue, foreign interference, especially from India, must not be taken lightly. “Pakistan’s unity — from Balochistan to Punjab — is our top priority,” he added.\nThe defence minister said politics should be based on ideology, not individuals. “No person is bigger than the country. Leaders come and go, but the nation and its values remain,” he said.\nHe criticized those who reduce politics to personal legacy. “Political parties that are built on ideas survive even after their leaders are gone,” he said. He gave examples of political martyrs in Pakistan whose parties lived on because of their beliefs, not their names.\nHe praised the role of Pakistani youth in the fight against terrorism. “Nations are built through the sacrifices of martyrs, not by worshipping individuals,” he said. The strength of a country, he said, comes from unity, not division.\nTurning to the economy, Khawaja Asif said Pakistan suffers huge losses due to tax evasion, especially in sectors like tobacco, real estate, steel, and tyres. “We lose around Rs 300 billion annually in tobacco taxes alone,” he said.\nHe acknowledged that the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made some improvements, but much more needs to be done. “If we can just improve our tax collection by 50%, we wouldn’t need foreign loans,” he noted.\nHe demanded accountability and urged the finance ministry and FBR to brief the parliament on the people behind large-scale tax evasion.\n“We need honesty in governance. Only then can we provide real relief to the people,” he said.\nHe gave the example of how public shops in Punjab are rented for very low rates, while private shops in the same area earn ten times more. “This has continued for decades without accountability,” he pointed out.\nHe called for a national campaign to end corruption, particularly in sectors dominated by a few corrupt families.\nKhawaja Asif praised Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, calling him a professional and experienced person. He credited him for bringing back international trust in Pakistan’s economy.\nHe shared encouraging economic data: GDP growth improved from -0.2% to +2.7%, inflation dropped to 4.6%, and the current account posted a $1.2 billion surplus. Foreign investment rose by 20%.\nHe admitted that the public may still be feeling economic pressure but said positive changes are happening. “The business community is showing more confidence, and the stock market recently hit a historic 125,000-point high,” he said.\nHe criticized those who now attack the government’s economic policy but had once urged the IMF not to support Pakistan. “These people tried to sabotage our economy,” he said.\n“Pakistan is not about any one person. It is a mission, a belief, and a shared history,” he added. He urged political leaders to rise above personal ambitions and serve the nation with sincerity.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
