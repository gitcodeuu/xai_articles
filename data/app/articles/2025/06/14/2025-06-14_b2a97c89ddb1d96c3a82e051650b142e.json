Adding momentum, Professor Sarwar Khawaja announced a generous £100,000 gift to the OPP’s endowment fund, contributing to the OPP’s long-term sustainability and institutionalisation.\nSponsored by Oxford alumni Dr. Omer Suleman and Mr Shamyl Malik (co-founders of financial technology firm Haruko), the dinner brought together donors, academics and OPP supporters to celebrate the programme’s impact. Since its inception, the OPP has awarded nearly £1 million in student support to 52 scholars, many from underserved regions in Pakistan such as Sindh, Balochistan and South Punjab, to study at Oxford.\nThe OPP’s co-founders underscored Pakistan’s demographic urgency, noting that two-thirds of its population is under 30, fuelling unprecedented demand for educational opportunities. Among this generation are brilliant minds who could be Pakistan’s future thought leaders and change makers, to whom the OPP is providing opportunities as well as hope.\nThroughout the evening, focus was also given to the need to develop educational aspiration and achievement amongst the British Pakistani community, to allow them to make a positive contribution to British society and public life. Through its scholarship programme, the OPP has provided substantive financial support to talented British Pakistani scholars.\nNobel Laureate Malala Yousafzai, a longstanding OPP advocate, delivered a keynote speech affirming: “When you support the OPP, you invest in Pakistan’s greatest resource: its youth. These scholars will return to lead industries, shape policies, and transform communities—creating ripples of progress for generations.”\nAttendees included Pakistan’s High Commissioner to the UK Dr. Mohammad Faisal, Ms Naz Shah MP, the Principal of Lady Margaret Hall Professor Stephen Blyth, Professor Sir Aziz Sheikh, as well as prominent business leaders, professionals and academics from the UK.\nThe event featured testimonials from OPP scholars and gratitude to cornerstone donors, including Ms Malala Yousafzai, Mr Ali Tareen, the Government of Balochistan, the COSARAF Foundation, the Dunya Foundation, and a growing community of philanthropists supporting partial scholarships.\nThese include: Mr Suleman Raza, Mr Hamid Ismail, Professor Stephen Blyth, Mr Areeb Azam, Mr Ammad Ahmad, Syed Babar Ali, Syed Sheharyar Ali, Pir Muhammad Sadiq, Mr Farouq Sheikh OBE and Mr Haroon Sheikh through the COSARAF Foundation, Mr Amir Hashmi, Mian Amer Mahmood through the Dunya Foundation, Mr Abdul Ghani Dadabhoy, Mr Mohammad Khaishgi, Professor Sarwar Khawaja, Dr Tariq and Mrs Abida Zaman, Mr Ahmed Owais Pirzada, Mr & Mrs Sheraz Mehmood, Mr Areeb Azam, Mr Omar Ghauri and Mr Asad Ghauri.\nWith these new pledges, the OPP moves closer to its founding mission to ensure that no Pakistani or British Pakistani student offered a place at Oxford is ever turned away due to financial barriers.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
