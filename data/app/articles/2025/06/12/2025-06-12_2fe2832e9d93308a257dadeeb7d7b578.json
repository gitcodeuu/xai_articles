  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP): The Supreme Court has released the reserved judgment in Noor Muqadam murder case dismissing the appeal filed by Zahir Jaffer, the primary accused in the brutal murder of Noor Mukadam, upholding his death sentence.\nIn a detailed 13-page verdict released on Thursday, the apex court declared that the murder was committed with extreme brutality and the convict did not deserve any leniency.\nThe judgment endorsed the rulings of the lower courts, terming them legally sound and based on incontrovertible evidence. The court stated that there was no room for doubt regarding the guilt of accused.\nIn a significant legal development, the Supreme Court recognized the “Silent Witness Theory,” stating that video footage obtained from a reliable source can serve as admissible evidence even in the absence of an eyewitness. The court noted that this principle has already been adopted in several countries, including the United States.\nThe court accepted all key pieces of evidence presented during the trial — including CCTV footage, DVR recordings, hard drives, DNA reports, and the murder weapon containing blood stains — as credible. The videos showed scenes of physical torture inflicted on Noor Mukadam.\nThe court also maintained the convictions of co-accused Muhammad Iftikhar and Muhammad Jan but ordered their release on the grounds that they have already served a substantial portion of their sentences.\nJustice Ali Baqar Najafi is expected to add a supplementary note to the verdict, offering further legal insight into the\ncase.",
