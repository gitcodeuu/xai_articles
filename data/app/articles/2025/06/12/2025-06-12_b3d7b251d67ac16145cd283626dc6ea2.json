Through this festival, we aim to share a cherished part of our culture with our friends in the diplomatic community,” Jam Kamal said in his brief remarks.\nHe said that while Pakistan is among the top producers of mangoes, there is still significant untapped potential in the mango industry that needs to be explored.\nHe also referred to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s ‘mango diplomacy’, emphasizing how the country’s signature fruit is being used to strengthen diplomatic ties and promote a positive image of Pakistan internationally.\nForeign Secretary Amna Baloch on the occasion highlighted the significance of the event as a celebration of Pakistan’s iconic fruit — the mango, often referred to as the ‘king of fruits’. She noted that Pakistan is the fifth-largest producer of mangoes in the world, that shows the country’s strong agricultural potential.\nShe further emphasized the government’s commitment to modernizing the agriculture sector, with a focus on enhancing the export of value-added agricultural products. The goal, she said, is to empower farmers and exporters to compete effectively in international markets.\nShe also thanked the Chief Executive Officer of the Serena Hotels Aziz Boolani for supporting the ministry in organizing the event.\nDuring the event, guests were treated to an exquisite variety of mangoes from across Pakistan, including Sindhri, Chaunsa, Anwar Ratol, and Langra. The event also featured mango-based desserts and drinks.",
