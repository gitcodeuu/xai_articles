  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP):The National Database and Registration Authority, upon the recommendations of Federal Minister for Interior and Narcotics Control Mohsin Naqvi and with the subsequent approval of Federal Cabinet, has implemented major changes to its Child Registration Certificate (CRC), also known as Form-B, introducing a revised structure that aims to strengthen child identity verification and block loopholes previously exploited in human smuggling.\nNADRA’s spokesperson and Director Public Engagement, Syed Shabahat Ali told Associated Press of Pakistan (APP) on Tuesday that the previous system lacked biometric or photographic identification for individuals under the age of 18. This absence of post-birth identification measures created vulnerabilities in the national registration system, making it susceptible to misuse by organized networks engaged in illegal migration and trafficking.\nTo counter these threats and ensure a secure and verifiable registration system, NADRA has now discontinued the earlier group form method that allowed multiple children to be registered collectively on a single form. With the amendments in NIC Rules 2002 notified on 19th Jun 2025, every child will require a separate, individual CRC form, enhancing an accuracy and accountability.\nThe new system introduces age-specific protocols for registration. For children under the age of three, NADRA will issue a CRC without a photograph or biometric data, and this certificate will automatically expire when the child turns three. From the age of three to under ten years, the child’s photograph becomes a mandatory requirement, and in NADRA centres equipped with advanced facilities, an iris scan may also be recorded. Once the child reaches ten years of age, a full biometric profile, including fingerprints, photographs, and iris scan (where available), is compulsory. The certificate issued at this stage remains valid until the child turns 18.\nAn important condition under the new policy is that parents must now present a birth registration certificate issued by the relevant Union Council before they can obtain a CRC from NADRA. Without this official document, the authority will not proceed with the registration process.\nMr. Shabahat emphasized that these changes were introduced to preserve the integrity of family structures in the national database and to ensure that only genuine familial links are reflected in official records. The updated system, he said, would protect the identities of Pakistani citizens from unauthorized inclusion and identity manipulation.\nHe further clarified that despite the introduction of biometric requirements and expiry dates, there has been no increase in the CRC processing fee, which remains the same.\nNADRA, he noted, has remained committed to offering affordable identity services . “When it comes to serve the registration of Pakistani nationals, Our objective has never been profit. It has always been to protect and authenticate the identity of Pakistanis,” he stated.\nIn addition to reforms in child registration, NADRA has made updates to the basic National Identity Card, commonly referred to as the non-smart or simple card. This version of the card now features a QR code to support digital verification, which can be scanned through NADRA’s official mobile application. Moreover, to assist citizens applying for travel documents, the applicant’s name and father’s name are now printed in both English and Urdu. This update is particularly aimed to facilitate card holders who want to obtain their passport to ensure consistency in data ( particularly spellings of their name) between national ID cards and passports, reducing the likelihood of discrepancies in spelling or transliteration.\nMr. Shabahat reiterated that the first-time issuance of the non-smart NIC upon reaching the age of 18 remains entirely free of charge. While citizens are later given the choice to apply for a smart card, which includes an electronic chip and enhanced security features, the non-smart card remains a valid and fully functional identity document.\nHowever, the NADRA spokesperson expressed serious concern over the growing number of citizens holding expired identity cards. Citing internal statistics, he revealed that more than 10 million citizens are currently using expired NICs, often unaware of the risks involved. He warned that expired cards can hinder access to emergency services, delay legal documentation, and pose significant challenges in critical situations such as hospital admissions or travel.\n“When a citizen’s ID card expires, it reflects a decade-old record. It becomes necessary for NADRA to update that individual’s biometric information to ensure continued authenticity,” he said.\nMr. Shabahat concluded by underlining that these comprehensive reforms were not only about data management but also about national security and identity protection. With improved verification processes, individual CRCs, biometric integration, and expiry tracking, NADRA aims to close long-standing gaps and reinforce the legitimacy and security of Pakistan’s identity infrastructure.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
