It unites Muslims from across continents, regardless of their language, ethnicity, or culture, under the banner of Tawheed and the finality of Prophethood (Peace Be Upon Him),” he noted.\nReferring to the Prophet Muhammad’s (Peace Be Upon Him) saying, “A believer to another believer is like a building whose parts support one another,” the ambassador highlighted how Hajj reflects the values of peace, solidarity, and fraternity among Muslims – principles that Saudi Arabia strives to uphold and promote through its global religious engagement.\nHe also reiterated Saudi Arabia’s leading role in supporting Muslim causes worldwide, especially the Palestinian issue. “The Kingdom has always stood at the forefront in defending the rights of Palestinians and providing humanitarian aid. It continues to work for a just and lasting solution to the crisis in Gaza through active diplomacy and international advocacy,” he said.\nAs custodian of Islam’s holiest sites, the ambassador said Saudi Arabia has made it a top priority to ensure the comfort and safety of pilgrims. He pointed to the Makkah Route Initiative – a flagship program launched by the Saudi Ministry of Hajj and Umrah – as a transformative step in streamlining the travel experience for pilgrims from countries including Pakistan.\n“These achievements would not have been possible without the guidance and personal supervision of King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,” he remarked. He concluded by praying for the peace, stability, and prosperity of Pakistan and the wider Muslim Ummah.\nThe conference concluded with a reaffirmation of the shared commitment of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan to continue working together in facilitating Hajj and promoting unity among Muslim nations.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
