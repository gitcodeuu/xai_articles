  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) successfully thwarted two major criminal attempts in separate operations conducted at Sialkot International Airport and in Multan.\nAt Sialkot Airport, the FIA Immigration officials prevented two murder suspects from fleeing the country. The suspects, identified as Jamshed Ashraf and Fahad Jamshed, were attempting to travel abroad on flight G9-533. Both individuals were wanted in a recent murder case registered just two days ago at Tanda Police Station in Gujrat district. Acting on a tip-off from local police, FIA apprehended the suspects from the airport’s waiting lounge and handed them over to concerned law enforcement authorities.\nIn a separate operation, the FIA Composite Circle Multan arrested a MEPCO (Multan Electric Power Company) employee red-handed for accepting a bribe in exchange for reducing an electricity bill. The suspect, identified as Khalid Sharif, was posted as a meter inspector in Melsi. He was caught while receiving Rs. 70,000 in bribe from a citizen. The accused had demanded the bribe to reduce a detection bill from Rs. 2 million to Rs. 400,000. Following the arrest, investigations have been initiated to identify other potential accomplices involved in the bribery scheme.\nFIA spokesperson confirmed both actions, reiterating the agency’s commitment to cracking down on corruption and criminal attempts to evade justice.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
