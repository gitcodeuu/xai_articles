  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): The federal capital currently lacks any operational government hostel for working women, a situation that has added to the challenges faced by female professionals in need of safe and affordable accommodation.\nAccording to an official source, the Nusrat Hostel in Sector G-6, which previously served as a residence for working women, was converted into a Girls Child Protection Center, which is also not functional at present. Similarly, the Staff Welfare Women Hostel in Sector G-7 was vacated approximately three months ago and has yet to be reopened.\nWorking women posted in various government departments, healthcare institutions, and educational organizations have expressed concern over the lack of residential facilities in Islamabad.\n“Affordable accommodation is a basic need. Without official hostels, we are left to search for expensive private options which are not always secure,” said Sadia Khan, a schoolteacher from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. “Many of us come from distant areas and do not have relatives here. Every month, a major portion of our salaries is spent on rent, which makes it difficult to manage other expenses”, she said.\nTalking to. APP, Samina Ali, a junior government officer from Punjab, shared her concern saying, “When I was transferred to Islamabad, I assumed there would be hostel support. But despite repeated inquiries, there is no clear response or timeline for reopening these facilities.” She added that staying in private hostels comes with its own set of challenges, including limited facilities, frequent rent hikes, and lack of proper security.\nFarzana Bibi, a nurse working at a public hospital, noted, “We work long shifts and need a safe place to rest. Living in shared private accommodations is neither ideal nor always safe. Government support in this regard would be greatly appreciated.” She emphasized that for female health workers and essential staff who often work night duties, proximity and safety are vital concerns that only official facilities can ensure.\nWhen contacted, Member National Assembly Shahida Rehmani, former Senate Chairman Nayyar Hussain Bukhari, and Senator Sherry Rehman acknowledged the issue and underlined the need for suitable residential arrangements for women professionals in the capital.\nThey expressed their commitment to raising the matter at relevant forums, emphasizing that a secure and affordable living environment plays an important role in supporting women’s participation in the workforce.\nConcerned individuals and stakeholders have urged the relevant authorities to take necessary steps for the revival of previously functional hostels and the establishment of new facilities to cater to the increasing number of working women in Islamabad.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
