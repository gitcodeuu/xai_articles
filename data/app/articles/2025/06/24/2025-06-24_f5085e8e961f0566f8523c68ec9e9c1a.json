  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 24 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday disposed of a petition regarding the recent elections of the Pakistan Tennis Federation (PTF) and stated that if anyone is aggrieved, they may seek remedy from the relevant forum, the Pakistan Sports Board, as per law.\nJustice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani heard the case and issued the instructions.\nThe petitioner, Lt. Col (Retd.) Muhammad Asif Dar, contended that the PTF held elections on February 10, 2024, in contravention of the directions issued by the PSB and contrary to judicial orders, and thus the elections should be declared null and void.\nThe legal counsel representing the PTF argued that the elections were conducted in accordance with constitutional provisions. Moreover, the petitioner neither contested the elections nor was a candidate, and hence cannot be considered an aggrieved party.\nPSB’s Legal Advisor, Saif-ur-Rehman Rao, submitted before the court that, in 2022, had directed the Pakistan Sports Board to notify the Election Commission, Election Regulations, and a Model Constitution for Sports Federations in accordance with the law and the 2022 Constitution.\nHe further informed the court that in compliance with the said judicial directives, the current Director General of the Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) had obtained approval from the PSB’s Board of Directors for the establishment of an Election Commission and Election Regulations and had also constituted an independent Panel of Adjudicators to hear appeals at the designated forum.\nAfter hearing arguments from all parties, the bench issued a detailed five-page judgment, disposing of the petition with directions that if any person is aggrieved by the electoral process, they may approach the PSB under its Constitution and seek remedy from the relevant forum (PSB).\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
