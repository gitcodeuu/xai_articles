  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Islamabad’s district administration has completed its preparations to manage waste during Eid ul Azha, ensuring a citywide cleanup operation to swiftly remove animal remains after sacrifices.\nThe spokesman of ICT administration told here Thursday that the Islamabad administration had announced a joint sanitation plan involving the Capital Development Authority (CDA), Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) and district departments. The plan includes dedicated dumping sites, distribution of special waste bags and deployment of staff and vehicles to ensure timely disposal of animal remains across the city, he told.\nIn this regard, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon recently visited one of the designated dumping points and briefed the media about the arrangements. He said that this year’s strategy builds on last year’s plan, with improvements in scale and coordination.\nTo facilitate proper disposal, 107 designated dumping points have been set up at 55 locations across Islamabad. These points will be used for collecting and managing animal waste during the three days of Eid.\nIn an effort to support households, the administration has doubled the number of biodegradable bags being distributed. Last year, 100,000 bags were handed out, while this year, 200,000 will be provided. These bags have been distributed to all union councils and delivered to individual homes.\nMore than 375 vehicles will be deployed throughout the city to collect waste from different areas. The sanitation operation will be supported by over 2,700 workers who will remain on duty during the Eid holidays to ensure quick response and efficient waste removal.\nA central control room will be active throughout the three days of Eid at the Safe City headquarters. Citizens have been asked to report delays in waste collection if teams fail to reach within 4 to 6 hours. A third-party monitoring system will also be in place to observe operations in all areas and help identify any shortcomings.\nThe DC appealed to residents to use the biodegradable bags for animal waste. A tracking system has been put in place to ensure that every area has a designated vehicle responsible for lifting waste. This system aims to streamline the entire process and ensure better coordination among field teams.\nSanitation teams will begin operations on the first day of Eid at 10:00 a.m. Residents have been urged to inform the authorities if any waste remains visible by the evening. Separate operational systems have been designed for various localities, including Rawat, Tarnol, and Nilore, to address the specific needs of each zone.\nIn addition to cleaning residential areas, arrangements have also been made for washing and cleanup at collective sacrifice points across the city.\nThe administration has also taken steps to prevent illegal cattle sales in public spaces. So far, 55 individuals have been detained for selling animals on highways and streets. The DC noted that buying and selling animals on main roads and intersections is not part of Islamabad’s tradition and warned of further action against violations.\nThe overall plan aims to keep Islamabad clean and organized during Eid ul Azha, with public cooperation considered key to its success.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
