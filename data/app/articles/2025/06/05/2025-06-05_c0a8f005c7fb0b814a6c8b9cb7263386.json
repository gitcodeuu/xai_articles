  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):More than two-thirds of vehicles tested in Islamabad’s emission monitoring campaign failed environmental standards, authorities revealed Thursday, with only 24 out of 75 vehicles passing inspections.\nThe joint operation by the Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency (Pak-EPA) and Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) at IJP Road and Subzi Mandi Thanna checkpoint found alarming pollution levels.\nSeventeen vehicles were fined for exceeding 75% smoke emissions, while four were impounded for emissions above 80% – levels described as “poison machines on wheels” by officials.\nAuthorities issued warnings to 30 drivers whose vehicles showed emission levels between 40-50%. “This campaign’s goal is cleaner air, not revenue collection,” a Pak-EPA spokesperson emphasized, noting repeat offenders could face registration cancellation.\nThe year-long initiative comes as Islamabad battles worsening air quality.\nMotorists are advised to service vehicles regularly and use quality fuel ahead of upcoming checks at Srinagar Highway and Murree Road this weekend.\n“These aren’t just traffic violations, but public health hazards,” an ITP officer warned, urging citizens to comply with emission standards for safer urban environment.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
