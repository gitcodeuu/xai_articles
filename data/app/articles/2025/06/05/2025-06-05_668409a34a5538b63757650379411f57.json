  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):The Capital Development Authority has launched its largest-ever Eid-ul-Azha cleanliness operation, deploying 2,500 sanitation workers and 250 vehicles across the federal capital.\nThe emergency measures come as the city prepares to handle more than 10,000 tons of sacrificial animal waste during the three-day festival.\nSanitation Director Tariq Ali told APP that the capital has been divided into five operational zones, with 107 specially-prepared disposal pits at 55 locations.\nHe said authorities have established two 24-hour emergency control rooms at the Sanitation Directorate (G-6/1-4) and Fire Headquarters (G-7/4), along with a central complaint center at Safe City in Sector H-11.\nResidents can report waste collection issues through multiple channels including the sanitation helpline (1334 or 9213908), phone calls (9203216, 9211555), or WhatsApp/SMS (03355001213).\nThe CDA, Ali said has distributed biodegradable bags across urban and rural areas and warned against illegal dumping in drains, forests or public bins.\nSanitation director said special arrangements for rural areas, with union councils handling cleanup in 15 suburban regions. “We’ve learned from previous years,” Ali said. “Our sector-wise teams and modern equipment will ensure timely waste removal.”\nHe warned of strict legal action against violators, particularly those slaughtering animals outside designated areas.\nHe noted that the cleanup operation will continue until all sacrificial waste is properly disposed of, with special focus on major sectors during the first two days of Eid before shifting to suburban areas.\nMeanwhile, Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa announced the cancellation of all sanitation staff holidays during a high-level meeting Wednesday. “We’re implementing a foolproof system to keep Islamabad clean and disease-free,” Randhawa said. “Our teams will work round-the-clock, but public cooperation is equally crucial.”\nRandhawa appealed to citizens: “Help us maintain Islamabad’s beauty. Proper waste disposal protects everyone’s health.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
