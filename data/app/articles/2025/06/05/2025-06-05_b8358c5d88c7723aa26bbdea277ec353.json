  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP):Experts on the World Environment Day 2025 webinar on Thursday urged the government and stakeholders to join forces for promoting circular economy, policy reform and grassroots action to tackle plastic pollution.\nThe Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) convened a high-level webinar to mark World Environment Day 2025, bringing together a diverse panel of policymakers, experts, development partners, and private sector stakeholders to tackle the growing challenge of plastic pollution, and to promote circular economy models aligned with the global theme: “Beat Plastic Pollution”, said a press release.\nDr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director SDPI, said: “Plastic isn’t the real problem—it’s the way we manage it.” He underscored the need for a system approach, involving plastic segregation, recycling infrastructure, and climate justice, stressing that Pakistan must not bear the burden of Western overconsumption.\n“Those exporting their plastic waste must co-finance our waste management and technology transfer.”\nOpening the session, Ubaidur Rehman Zia, Head of Energy Unit at SDPI, emphasized the deep interlinkages between pollution and plastics, stating that the health and ecological toll on Pakistan has become unsustainable. He stressed that reuse and circularity should take precedence, and that waste-to-energy should be treated as a last resort. A call was made for policy-centric and diplomatically aligned action plans moving forward.\nDr Hassan Daud Butt, Head of Energy (China), lauded SDPI’s efforts as a torchbearer of clean energy, stating: “It’s time for tangible action. Any environmental effort today is an investment in future generations.”\nHe called for cross-border climate cooperation, citing China’s recent reduction of 1% CO2 emissions amidst economic growth. Dr Butt emphasized making green solutions “fashionable and affordable,” particularly electric vehicles, and suggested CPEC Phase 2 be turned into a Green Energy Accelerator for off-grid solutions in regions like Gilgit Baltistan and KP.\nDr Irfan Yousaf highlighted that plastic waste must be recognized as a top-tier development challenge. He suggested reusing plastics in construction, industrial design, and local crafts, especially in Karachi and Lahore where informal innovation thrives. However, he warned against bans on single-use plastics without viable alternatives, advocating for inclusive approaches that create jobs and empower marginalized communities.\nAsad Mehmood, an energy expert, pointed to the critical governance gap, emphasizing the need for local governments to lead in managing plastic use transitions and engage with communities to ensure inclusive data collection and decision-making.\nHammad Bashir, an expert from PFAN (Private Financing Advisory Network), shared success stories of clean energy and\ncircularity projects that have mobilized over $3.5 billion globally, with several exclusive projects in Pakistan. From women-led recycling firms in Lahore to automated plastic vending machines in Karachi, Pakistan’s private sector is innovating but needs financial and regulatory support to scale.\nSaleha Qureshi, Head of Industrial Decarbonization Programme, called for a more systemic and coordinated approach to waste management and decarbonization. She cited Pakistan’s 40 million tonnes/day waste production as a “massive opportunity” for industrial recycling and suggested utilizing agricultural residue as a clean fuel substitute in cement production.\nShe also flagged the absence of a regulatory framework for Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR), particularly regarding solar panel recycling.\nILO’s Razi Haider Mujtaba raised a vital human dimension: the poor working conditions of workers in the plastic value chain, many lacking PPEs, contracts, or safety nets. He urged the inclusion of these informal workers in all strategies, stating, “Decent work must be the foundation of any circular economy transition.”\nWWF’s Nazifa Butt echoed the urgency, pointing to poor infrastructure and drainage systems clogged by plastics in urban centers like Islamabad. She emphasized the need for on-ground actions, proper landfills, and investment in climate-smart waste management, especially in neglected regions.\nHumaira Jahanzeb from the Living Indus Initiative emphasized that plastic pollution is both a waste and development issue. With wetlands revival, social inclusion, and the Indus ecosystem at stake, she called for harmonized policies that integrate plastic management with long-term climate resilience.\nRepresenting SwitchAsia, Ranga Pallawalla called plastic pollution part of the “Triple Planetary Crisis” (climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution). He highlighted that EPR frameworks should go beyond compliance, and foster innovation in plastic design to reduce environmental impact.\nZia Hyder Naqi from Spel Group critiqued Pakistan’s poor data infrastructure, noting that real plastic waste may be overestimated due to lack of verifiable data. He advocated for creating intrinsic value for plastics to promote voluntary recycling—much like PET bottles.\nConcluding the event, Dr Zainab Naeem, SDPI’s Head of Circularity and moderator of the webinar, emphasized: “Plastic regulations are meaningless without infrastructure and implementation. We must build consensus, commit to action, and move from intention to execution.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
