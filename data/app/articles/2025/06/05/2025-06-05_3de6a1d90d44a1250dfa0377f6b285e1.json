  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 5 (APP): India’s political landscape has, over the years, been increasingly influenced by the ideology of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a right-wing Hindu nationalist organization advocating for a unified cultural and religious identity rooted in Hindutva. This ideology includes the concept of Akhand Bharat (Undivided India), envisioning a greater Indian civilization extending beyond current national borders. Concerns about this ideology have been expressed both within India and across South Asia.\nSeveral neighboring countries—Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, and others—have voiced concerns over India’s ideological shift, fearing risks to regional peace, minority safety, and diplomatic ties. Despite its global influence, India’s tilt toward Hindutva politics has raised alarms about press freedom, minority rights, and regional trust.\nUpon asking has Hindutva ideology made it harder for India to maintain good relations with neighbouring countries? Former Ambassador General (retd) Raza Muhammad, talking to APP, responded that “India’s founding fathers such as Gandhi and Nehru had envisioned a secular state, but the RSS even in its early years functioned as a Hindu extremist group. Gandhi himself was assassinated by an RSS follower. Today, the influence of the RSS has deeply penetrated the BJP, Indian society and governance under Modi resulting in irrational and aggressive foreign policy behavior”. He also pointed to the Akhand Bharat mural displayed in the Indian Parliament as a symbol of India’s expansionist mindset encompassing much of South Asia parts of Afghanistan and even China. Populism and religious extremism have taken root, leading to strained or hostile relations with nearly all of India’s neighboring countries including Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and even Bhutan. He explained that Hindutva has now become central to India’s national conduct leading to systemic atrocities against minorities. Despite this, India’s strategic significance especially as a counterweight to China for the U.S. has shielded it from international scrutiny. He stated that international silence is rooted in political expediency. The influence of the U.S. and the West on global institutions like the UN discourages open criticism of India.\nTurning to the perspectives of journalists offers clearer insight into how ideological shifts are represented in Indian media and how press freedom has evolved under Hindutva influence. AJJ TV journalist Aqsa, in an interview with APP, stated that “Under PM Modi’s government, press freedom in India has faced significant challenges, with increased censorship and pressure on journalists to align with the government narrative. The rise of RSS and Hindutva ideology has contributed to this trend, with many media outlets promoting a nationalist agenda.”\nShe highlighted that journalists reporting on minority rights or foreign relations face intense pressure, including online harassment, legal threats, and physical intimidation. Many outlets now reflect a pro-government bias, particularly in coverage of neighboring countries, often portraying them negatively to reinforce nationalist narratives. This erosion of press freedom illustrates how deeply Hindutva has penetrated Indian institutions, including the media.\nAdding a political dimension, Dr. Zohaib Gillani, a renowned political analyst talking to APP, emphasized the ideological influence on India’s foreign policy. He explained, “The RSS, the ideological parent of the ruling BJP, wields significant influence, shaping Indian identity through a majoritarian Hindu lens. Under Modi, this framework has increasingly influenced foreign policy, tying diplomatic narratives to Hindu history and civilizational pride.”\nHe also noted that RSS ideology favors assertiveness over non-alignment, particularly in dealing with Muslim-majority neighbors like Pakistan and Bangladesh, where ideological differences strain relations. In contrast, India is trying to strengthen ties with countries like Nepal and Sri Lanka by emphasizing shared Hindu-Buddhist cultural heritage. This often sidelines secular diplomatic norms in favor of religious and cultural diplomacy. As a result, India’s regional diplomacy has become more complex, especially regarding minority rights and the internal diversity of neighboring nations\nIn light of expert views, it is clear that RSS and Hindutva ideology have deeply influenced India’s media, diplomacy, and regional relations. This shift from secularism to religious nationalism has strained ties with its neighbors. The long-term impact on India’s democratic image and regional stability is concerning.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
