  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP): The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has issued a severe heatwave warning across most parts of the country during the upcoming Eid-ul-Adha holidays and the following week.\nAccording to the Met Office, a high-pressure system is expected to develop over the country on June 07, which will grip most regions from June 08 onwards, significantly increasing day temperatures.\nDaytime temperatures are expected to rise 5-7C above normal in the upper half of the country, including central and upper Punjab, Islamabad, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan from June 7-12.\nIn the southern half, covering upper and central Sindh, southern Punjab, and parts of Balochistan, temperatures are likely to remain 4-6C above normal during the same period.\nDust storms and gusty winds are also anticipated over the plains due to excessive surface heating.\nThe Met Office has urged the general public, especially children, elderly, and women, to avoid prolonged sun exposure and stay well-hydrated.\nThe citizens are advised to take all precautionary measures to prevent heat-related illnesses.\nRising temperatures in the northern areas could accelerate the snowmelt rate, potentially affecting water flows in rivers. The authorities have urged the judicious use of water and requested farmers to plan their crop activities in line with the forecast.\nAll concerned departments have been advised to stay alert and take necessary actions to mitigate risks during this severe weather spell.\nThe Met Office also recommended regularly checking official weather updates for the latest information and safety guidance.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
