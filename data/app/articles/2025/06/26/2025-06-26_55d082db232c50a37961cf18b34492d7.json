  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP):Lawmakers in the National Assembly on Thursday called for the extension of tax exemptions for the merged tribal districts (former FATA) and PATA, citing ongoing security concerns and the hardships faced by internally displaced persons (IDPs).\nFederal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan Engineer Amir Muqam, reminded the House that after the initial five-year tax exemption period ended, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had generously extended the relief once more. He urged the government to further continue the exemption due to worsening law and order and rising terrorism in the region.\nFormer National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser also appealed to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb to restore the tax exemption. “The same conditions still exist today. The tribal people are suffering and their difficulties must be recognized,” he said.\nAnother member, Shehryar Afridi, emphasized the ongoing border security threats and the sacrifices of the tribal communities who have long served as Pakistan’s frontline defenders.\nHe said the situation in ex-FATA remains similar to when the relief was first granted, making it essential to continue support.\nLawmakers jointly requested the Speaker and Finance Ministry to devise a comprehensive rehabilitation plan, particularly to assist the IDPs who remain displaced and neglected.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
