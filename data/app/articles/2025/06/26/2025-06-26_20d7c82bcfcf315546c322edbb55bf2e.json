The committee confirmed that the crescent marking the beginning of Muharram 1447 AH has been sighted.\nConsequently, the first day of Muharram-ul-Haram 1447 AH will fall on Friday, June 27, 2025, marking the start of the new Islamic year for Muslims across Pakistan.\nMuharram is the first month of the Islamic lunar calendar and holds profound religious significance, particularly for commemorating the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain (RA) and the tragedy of Karbala.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
