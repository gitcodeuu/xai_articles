  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP):The members of the Kashmiri delegation, present in Geneva, have called upon the international community to take stock of the Indian government’s relentless and brutal suppression of political and human rights in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nDuring their interactions with various diplomats, representatives of international NGOs and officials of the UN human rights council, the members of the delegation including Mrs. Shamim Shawl, Dr Saira Farooq Shah, Naila Altaf Kayani and Ms. Mehr ur Nisa Rehman briefed them about the latest situation in the held territory that witnessed a new wave of oppression following the India’s false flag operation in Pahalgam, received a press release from Geneva here on Thursday.\nReferring to the continued bloodshed and violence in the restive region, the delegates voiced their grave concern over arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings of Kashmiri youth and witch-hunting of political and human rights defenders.\nSeeking the UNHRC and other relevant bodies’ effective role to prevent bloodbath of innocent Kashmiris, they said that effective accountability was vital to hold perpetrators to account.\nThey observed that the lack of a proper accountability system in the region was one of the major reasons behind the unrest and chaos—that reigns the region supreme—despite Indian government’s claims of so-called normalcy. They noted with concern that there was no letup in state repression and human rights abuses. Citing media reports the Kashmiri delegates stated that following the BJP government’s controversial decision to abrogate Articles 370 and 35-A the region continues to seethe in anger while essential fundamental freedoms including the right to freedom of opinion and expression, the right to peaceful protest and assembly remain largely curtailed.\nThey said that Indian actions such as arbitrary arrests and detention of Kashmiri youth under draconian laws and witch-hunting of political activists and human rights defenders have created a climate of fear and insecurity amongst the Kashmiri populace. “Blatant invocation and application of draconian laws such as PSA, UAPA and AFSPA by the Indian government have led to ruthless suppression of dissent and dissenters in the region”, they said, while seeking the international community’s proactive role to hold the India’s human rights abusing regime accountable.\nThey said that despite growing calls for states to be held accountable for violating international law, the Indian government was using these colonial era laws to suppress legitimate political voices and the Kashmiris’ rightful demand for right to self-determination guaranteed to them by the international community.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
