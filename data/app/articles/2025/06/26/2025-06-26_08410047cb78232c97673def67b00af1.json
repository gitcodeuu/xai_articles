I pray that Allah may make our state and national institutions more strong, effective and a real model of service to the people, give our youth expertise in knowledge and skills and high character and make Pakistan successful among the comity of nations as a honourable, peaceful and developed state. Ameen. Long Live Pakistan,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
