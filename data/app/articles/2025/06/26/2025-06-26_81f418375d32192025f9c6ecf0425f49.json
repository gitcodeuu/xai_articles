  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 26 (APP): As the month of Muharram begins, the Islamabad administration has announced strict security measures to ensure peace during religious processions and imposed ban on the use of drones and similar devices.\nAccording to the spokesman of district administration, the authority has enforced a ban on flying drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) without prior approval during Muharram. The move is part of the broader security arrangements aimed at maintaining order throughout the month, which holds religious significance for many.\nAccording to an official notification issued by the Additional Deputy Commissioner General (ADCG) Islamabad, the use of drones, drone cameras, and other similar equipment is strictly prohibited under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The restriction will remain in effect for the next two months.\nThe notification stated that the decision has been made to prevent any security threats during gatherings and processions. Law enforcement agencies have been directed to ensure compliance with the ban, and legal action will be taken against those found violating the order.\nThe administration has also advised the public to cooperate with authorities and avoid flying drones near religious gatherings. Officials said the measure is essential to prevent any potential misuse of technology that could compromise safety during Muharram events.\nIn a related development, the Additional Deputy Commissioner General recently visited Bari Imam to inspect arrangements for the 11th Muharram procession. During the visit, he reviewed security protocols, cleanliness along the route, and overall management plans.\nOfficials from the Secretariat sub-division briefed the ADCG on preparations made for the procession. Sanitation workers have been deployed to clean the procession route, while security personnel will be stationed at key points to manage crowds and ensure smooth movement.\nThe city administration is working closely with law enforcement agencies and religious organizers to finalize all necessary arrangements for upcoming processions. Checkpoints will be set up along key routes, and surveillance systems will be used to monitor activity.\nIn addition to ground deployment, authorities are also focusing on crowd control and emergency response planning. Rescue teams will be on standby, and medical services will be available near the main congregation areas.\nSpecial attention is being given to maintaining cleanliness and waste management along procession routes to ensure a safe and hygienic environment. The Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) has been tasked with regular cleaning and sanitation duties throughout Muharram.\nPolice and Rangers are expected to patrol sensitive areas and keep an eye on suspicious activities. Officials said the use of metal detectors, walk-through gates, and surveillance cameras will be part of the standard security procedure.\nThe Islamabad administration has urged citizens to report any unusual activity to the nearest police station or helpline. A central control room will also be established to respond to emergency calls and coordinate efforts among various departments.\nTraffic plans are also being finalized to avoid congestion during major processions. The Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) will issue alternative routes for commuters and provide updates through social media and FM radio.\nIn areas where processions are expected, streetlights will be checked and repaired, and additional lighting will be installed where needed. Water tankers and mobile toilets will also be provided along longer routes.\nThe Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration emphasized that these efforts are part of a broader plan to facilitate peaceful observance of religious activities while ensuring the safety of participants and the general public.\nThe enforcement of Section 144, combined with enhanced surveillance and community engagement, is aimed at maintaining public order and avoiding any untoward incidents during Muharram.\nAuthorities have appealed to all residents of Islamabad to cooperate with the administration, follow guidelines, and avoid actions that could disrupt public peace.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
