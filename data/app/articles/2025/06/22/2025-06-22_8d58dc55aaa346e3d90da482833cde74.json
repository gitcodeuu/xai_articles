Moreover, the use and abuse of black laws such as AFSPA, UAPA and Public Safety Act against javelins, arbitrary detention of political leaders, killing of unarmed civilians and the issue of un-named mass graves discovered in many areas within and outside the valley of Kashmir would be highlighted at the august forum to seek rights bodies’ urgent attention towards the simmering situation in the region.\nThe delegation is comprised of Ghulam Muhammad Safi the Convenor All Parties Hurriyat Conference AJK chapter , Sardar Amjad Yousaf Executive Director KIIR, Syed Faiz Naqashbandi, Mrs Shamim shawl, Dr Saira Shah , Naila Altaf Kani and Ms Mehr ur Nisa.\nPertinently, Jammu and Kashmir is a UN recognized disputed territory, a significant portion of which is under the illegal control of India. Since 1947, the people of region have been engaged in a peaceful struggle for their right to self-determination as promised to them by the international community as well as the respective leadership of both India and Pakistan.\nCurrently, nearly a million Indian military and paramilitary troops are stationed in the region, which makes it the world’s highest militarized region.\nOperating with immunity under black laws, the Indian forces are grossly involved in serious human rights violations. The human rights organizations have repeatedly classified their conduct as war crimes.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
