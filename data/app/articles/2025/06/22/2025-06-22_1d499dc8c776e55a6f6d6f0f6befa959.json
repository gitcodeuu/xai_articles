  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 22 (APP): As Islamabad faces yet another punishing heatwave with “feels like” temperatures soaring to 50°C, the city’s shrinking tree cover is turning entire sectors into heat traps. In neighborhoods where mature trees still stand, residents find some refuge from the scorching sun—but in many areas, the absence of shade is making life unbearable. The capital’s changing climate is no longer a warning—it’s a lived reality, demanding urgent action from both the civic authorities and the citizens.\nIn areas like F-6 and parts of E-7, mature trees—such as neem, peepal, bohar, and amaltas—do more than beautify the streets. They lower temperatures, allow for breezes, and make it possible for residents to sit outdoors even during scorching afternoons.\nBut the situation changes dramatically in places like G-6, G-7, G-13, and G-14. Here, tree cover is sparse or consists of younger trees that provide minimal cooling. “The streets feel like ovens,” said Kamran Khan, a G-6 resident. “The sun burns from above, and the heat radiates from below. There’s no escape.”\nIslamabad urgently needs thousands of new trees—especially in rapidly urbanizing sectors like G-13, G-14, the H-sectors, and Bhara Kahu. But not just any trees—the city needs native, climate-resilient species that provide real shade and cooling benefits.\n“Trees are no longer a luxury—they’re a necessity,” said Noreen, a resident of G-7. “If we want to survive these summers, we need shade, not just more concrete.”\nOne major misstep has been the widespread planting of safeda (eucalyptus) trees. Though they grow quickly, these trees are now criticized for consuming vast amounts of groundwater, providing little shade, and leaving the ground warmer. “It might grow fast, but it gives back very little,” wrote one concerned citizen on Facebook. “We need trees that help the environment, not just fill space.”\nEnvironmental expert Nasir Ali Panhwar warns of worsening urban heat island effects in fast-growing cities like Islamabad. He stresses the importance of nature-based solutions, including extensive tree plantation and green infrastructure like green roofs and vertical gardens. “These not only cool urban areas but also restore biodiversity and improve air quality,” he explained.\nThe climate threat is growing, compounded by rapid urbanization and unchecked population growth. According to Global Forest Watch, Pakistan lost 5.35 thousand hectares of tree cover to fires and 4.19 thousand hectares to other causes between 2001 and 2024. Alarmingly, in just one week, from June 8 to June 15, 2025, 2,587 fire alerts were recorded across the country. This marks a steep rise compared to previous years.\nUnder the leadership of Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has launched an ambitious tree-planting campaign, aiming to plant one million trees during the Spring and Monsoon seasons of 2025. But experts caution that planting alone isn’t enough, it’s about planting the right trees in the right places.\nNaseer Memon, a leading voice on climate change and urban planning, paints a grim picture: “Our cities are fast becoming mini-hells. Green belts are disappearing, replaced by unchecked infrastructure. Vehicular emissions and overuse of air conditioning are creating hot islands across urban Pakistan.”\nMemon calls for aggressive social forestry measures, enforced by building control agencies. “Every new structure should be mandated to plant and nurture trees until they reach maturity,” he said. “Cosmetic plantation drives won’t solve the problem. Trees are a nature-based solution to improving microclimates in cities exposed to severe and frequent heatwaves.”\nWhen Islamabad was established in the late 1960s, it was planned as a green city surrounded by forests, with nearly two-thirds of its land covered by trees. Over the decades, rapid urban growth and development have reduced this tree cover dramatically. Today, less than one-third of the city’s original forest area remains, making the loss of greenery a visible and urgent challenge for the capital’s climate and livability.\nAs Islamabad continues to expand, experts and residents alike are calling for smarter urban forestry strategies. Planting native, climate-adapted trees is not just about comfort, it’s about survival, in the face of escalating climate change and global warming.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
