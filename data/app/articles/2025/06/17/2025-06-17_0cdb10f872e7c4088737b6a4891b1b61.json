  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP): The Directorate of Municipal Administration (DMA) has terminated its contract with AJCL, the firm responsible for digitizing Islamabad’s parking system, after uncovering financial irregularities, contractual violations, and systemic negligence.\nOfficials from the DMA told APP on Tuesday that AJCL failed to implement promised digital payment solutions, instead conducting unrecorded cash transactions that led to revenue losses.\nThe company also neglected security measures, resulting in thefts and public complaints.\nDespite repeated warnings, AJCL did not address these issues, prompting the DMA to revoke the contract and file a police report (FIR) at Kohsar Police Station.\nSince taking direct control of parking operations, the DMA reports a significant increase in revenue, attributing the improvement to transparent management.\nAJCL has challenged the termination in court, but the administration vows to defend its decision, emphasizing its commitment to fair and efficient public services.\n“DMA will not tolerate negligence or malpractice that harms citizens’ trust,” the spokesperson said. “We are determined to ensure accountability and better services for Islamabad’s residents.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
