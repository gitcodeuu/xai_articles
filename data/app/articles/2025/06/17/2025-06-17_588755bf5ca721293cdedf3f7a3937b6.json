With the Benazir Hunarmand Programme, we are enabling people to stand on their feet, build skills, and step out of the poverty cycle with dignity,” said Chairperson BISP Senator Rubina Khalid, while addressing participants at the consultative workshop held at BISP Headquarters on Tuesday.\nThe workshop brought together key stakeholders under the Friends of BISP platform, including representatives from the Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Pakistan, development partners such as WFP, WHO, GIZ, and various non-governmental organizations (NGOs). All participants welcomed the initiative and pledged full support for its successful execution.\nChairperson Rubina Khalid emphasized that the Benazir Hunarmand Programme is deeply rooted in the vision of Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, who believed that “skill is your asset.”\n“We are already improving lives through financial support, but now we aim to transform those lives by offering market-relevant, demand-driven skill development and international certifications,” she added.\nSecretary BISP, Amer Ali Ahmad also addressed the session and assured full institutional support for the programme, reaffirming BISP’s commitment to inclusive, evidence-based, and people-centered development.\nIn an open discussion stakeholders not only appreciated BISP’s innovative approach to poverty graduation but also expressed strong willingness to collaborate in program implementation, industry linkage, and employment facilitation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
