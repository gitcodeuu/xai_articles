  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP):Federal Minister for Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar on Tuesday assured the Senate that the Ministry of Finance and all relevant departments are actively considering the Senate’s recommendations during the ongoing budget discussions for fiscal year 2025–26.\nResponding to a query raised by Opposition Leader Senator Shibli Faraz, he clarified that both the Senate and National Assembly Finance Committees are holding daily meetings.\nThese sessions include participation from the Finance Minister, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) officials, and representatives from all political parties, he added.\nHe emphasized that the Senate is playing its constitutional role in the budget process by forwarding its recommendations to the National Assembly.\n“All Senators put forward their suggestions and objections, and voting takes place when required,” he said.\nAzam Tarar said that he is personally attending the meetings and relevant departments are closely following the proceedings.\nHighlighting the government’s commitment to transparency and collaboration, Azam Tarar said that under the current leadership, ministers are not only present in the House but also actively engaged in committee meetings — a contrast to previous years when only a Minister of State would attend.\nSenator Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui also acknowledged the validity of the Opposition Leader’s concerns, saying that the suggestions being raised deserve proper attention.\nHe reassured the House that senior officials from the Finance Ministry are in attendance during the sessions, taking detailed notes and that the Finance Minister himself is overseeing the process.\nSiddiui said the Senators are submitting their recommendations in writing to the concerned committees, ensuring their input is formally recorded and reviewed./APP rzr-tsw-mkz\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
