  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): UN Women, in partnership with the Ministry of Human Rights, has completed the refurbishment of the Family protection and rehabilitation center in Islamabad.\nThis initiative marks a substantial upgrade in the center’s capacity to deliver high-quality, survivor-centered services in a safe, confidential, and dignified environment.\nThe refurbishment was undertaken under the Essential Services Package (ESP) initiative, with support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), Australia. The ESP aims to provide a coordinated set of essential, multisectoral services to survivors of violence, aligned with international human rights standards and global best practices.\nSpeaking at the occasion, Mr. Jamshed Kazi, UN Women Country Representative, emphasized the importance of the initiative, “The refurbishment of the Family protection and rehabilitation center is not just about infrastructure, it represents a crucial link in a wider ecosystem of support for survivors of gender-based violence. When combined with legal reforms, institutional capacity building, and community engagement, initiatives like this can catalyze systemic change. Our aim is to ensure that every survivor, regardless of where they are in Pakistan, has access to quality, coordinated services that uphold their dignity and rights.”\nThe upgraded facility now features improved infrastructure, private consultation rooms, and integrated service delivery including medical care, psychological counseling, legal assistance, and safe referrals—all under one roof. The enhancements aim to ensure survivors are not only supported but also empowered through every stage of recovery and justice-seeking.\nMr. Azam Nazir Tarrar, Federal Minister for Human Rights, underscored the value of strong partnerships in addressing GBV, “We are grateful to UN Women for its continued partnership in strengthening Pakistan’s response to gender-based violence. This initiative reflects our shared commitment to improving essential services for survivors, particularly the most vulnerable. The upgraded Family protection and rehabilitation center will allow us to respond more effectively, ensuring dignity, safety, and support for every woman and child who seeks help\nThis joint effort is part of a broader strategy to strengthen Pakistan’s national response to GBV, focusing on survivor-sensitive case management, improved coordination among service providers, and building institutional capacity. UN Women continues to work with federal and provincial authorities to scale up access to essential services across the country.\nThrough this initiative, UN Women and the Ministry of Human Rights reaffirm their commitment to a Pakistan where survivors of GBV are supported, protected, and empowered—with access to justice, healing, and a future free from violence.\nGender-based violence (GBV) remains a critical human rights issue in Pakistan and globally, with nearly one in three women worldwide affected, according to UN Women. In Pakistan, over 63,000 cases were reported between 2020 and 2023, the majority involving domestic violence. These figures likely underrepresent the true scale, as many survivors face stigma, fear of retaliation, and limited access to support. GBV not only endangers lives but also restricts women’s participation in education, employment, and public life. Addressing it requires both legal reform and practical support services. Facilities like the Family protection and rehabilitation Center play a vital role by offering integrated, survivor-focused care—providing safety, dignity, and critical services under one roof to help women and children rebuild their lives.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
