  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration took action against the indoor sheesha café operating in Sector F-8, where officials sealed the premises and arrested those running the business.\nThe spokesman of ICT administration said that an indoor sheesha café in Sector F-8 of Islamabad was sealed on Friday after being found operational in violation of rules, despite holding a terrace-only smoking permit.\nAccording to the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, the establishment had been granted permission to offer sheesha on the terrace only. However, during a surprise inspection, a magistrate discovered that the café was serving sheesha indoors, which is not allowed under local regulations.\nThe inspection was led by an magistrate, who found multiple sheesha pipes in use inside the closed area of the café. Following the inspection, the café was immediately sealed and a case was registered against the owners.\nThe magistrate stated that such actions will continue against all businesses found violating sheesha regulations. Indoor smoking is banned across public places in the capital, and only outdoor or terrace areas are allowed to offer limited smoking services under special permits.\nOfficials also added that several complaints had been received from local residents about indoor smoking in the café. Acting on these reports, the magistrate conducted the raid without prior notice.\nThe administration has reiterated that it will not tolerate unauthorized indoor smoking facilities in cafés, restaurants or lounges. ICT officials said a city-wide campaign is ongoing to monitor all sheesha outlets and ensure they follow the terms of their permits strictly.\nBusiness owners have been reminded to operate only in permitted zones and warned that violation of these conditions will result in strict action, including arrests and permanent closure of outlets.\nIn recent weeks, the ICT administration has intensified inspections of public entertainment and food outlets after receiving reports of indoor smoking and unlicensed sheesha services. Several cafés in various sectors of Islamabad have already been issued notices or sealed for similar violations.\nOfficials emphasized that the move aims to protect public health and ensure compliance with anti-smoking laws. The crackdown will continue in the coming days.\nThe administration has urged citizens to report any such violations through helplines or official portals so that prompt action can be taken.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
