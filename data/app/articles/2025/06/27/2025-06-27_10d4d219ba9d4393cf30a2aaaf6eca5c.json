Reflecting on global injustices, he noted that the world has witnessed three major genocides in the last three decades– Rwanda, Bosnia, and the ongoing one in Gaza and highlighted the double-standards of the international system.\nHe commended the growing Pakistan–Rwanda relationship in diverse areas from political to economic to defence, and called for deeper South-South cooperation, underscoring the potential for enhanced engagement between Pakistan, Rwanda, and the broader African continent.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood, Director General ISSI, recalled the tragic events of the 1994 genocide against the Tutsi community and noted that Rwanda’s Liberation Day stands as a solemn reminder of that painful chapter, as well as a powerful symbol of the country’s journey towards healing, reconciliation, and national transformation.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood commended Rwanda’s success in fostering inclusive governance, digital advancement, social cohesion, and sustainable development, highlighting its reputation as a model of post-conflict recovery and institutional reform.\nHe underlined Pakistan’s admiration for Rwanda’s progress and reaffirmed the significance of Pakistan’s diplomatic outreach to Africa within the framework of “Engage Africa” policy.\nHe noted that the milestones like mutual establishment of each other’s resident missions mark a shared commitment to expanding bilateral ties in sectors such as trade, agriculture, higher education, healthcare, technology, and professional training.\nReferring to the recent visit of Foreign Minister Olivier J. P. Nduhungirehe to Islamabad, during which he also visited ISSI and delivered a talk on Rwanda’s role in Africa’s transformation, Ambassador Sohail Mahmood welcomed the growing momentum in bilateral relations and stressed the importance of sustained dialogue and cooperation. He also highlighted Pakistan’s longstanding contribution to UN peacekeeping in Africa, including in Rwanda, as part of its commitment to peace, stability, and progress on the continent.\nAmbassador Hamid Asghar called the Rwandan genocide a failure of the UN system, with its legacy echoed in Gaza today. He praised Rwanda’s resilience and development under President Kagame and expressed Pakistan’s interest in deeper ties.

She emphasized the deepening Rwanda–Pakistan relationship, marked by diplomatic missions and MoUs in key sectors. She thanked Pakistan for its hospitality and expressed commitment to expanding cooperation in trade, education, and tourism.\nNaeem Khan noted the growing strength of Pakistan-Rwanda relations, marked by a rise in trade from $34 million to $127 million and a growing Pakistani community in Rwanda. He highlighted high-level visits, business delegations, and scholarships for Rwandan students as key drivers of deeper economic, cultural, and educational ties, reflecting the strong mutual commitment to enhanced cooperation.\nLt Col Shyaka Kajugiro Ismail recalled Rwanda’s long history of kingship and the struggle for liberation, marking the 31st anniversary with a reminder of the international community’s failure during the 1994 genocide.
