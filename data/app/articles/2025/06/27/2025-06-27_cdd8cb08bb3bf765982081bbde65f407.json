  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 27 (APP): The district administration has launched an operation in Islamabad’s Blue Area to remove encroachments in front of shops, cleared the occupied space and detained seven shopkeepers for resisting the removal.\nAccording to the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, shopkeepers had placed items and structures in front of their shops, violating municipal regulations and obstructing pedestrian movement. In response, a team from the local administration, accompanied by law enforcement, arrived at the scene and removed the encroachments.\nDuring the operation, authorities confiscated the displayed items placed on footpaths and public walkways. The enforcement team acted after repeated warnings issued to the shopkeepers had gone unheeded.\nOfficials said that seven shopkeepers who tried to interfere with the operation or failed to comply with instructions were taken into custody and shifted to the local police station. Legal proceedings have been initiated against them under relevant municipal and public obstruction laws.\nThe ICT administration stated that similar operations will continue across commercial areas in the capital to ensure public access and compliance with civic rules. Officials also noted that despite prior notifications, several businesses continue to occupy sidewalks and service lanes, creating difficulties for pedestrians and violating city planning guidelines.\nThe operation is part of a broader campaign by the district administration to reclaim public space and maintain order in key commercial zones. Authorities say the drive aims to ensure that public walkways remain clear and accessible.\nIn the coming days, inspection teams will continue to visit various sectors of Islamabad, particularly busy business zones, to identify and remove unlawful extensions or setups outside shops and markets.\nThe administration has called on all shop owners to voluntarily remove any encroachments in front of their outlets and avoid placing goods outside their designated premises. Failure to do so will result in further actions including fines, arrests, and sealing of shops, officials warned.\nPublic response to the operation has been mixed. While some residents welcomed the move to clear blocked sidewalks, others urged the administration to also address traffic congestion and illegal parking, which they say are major problems in the Blue Area.\nThe ICT administration has assured that its campaign will address all forms of encroachment and obstruction in commercial zones, and urged citizens to report violations through official helplines.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
