Patients from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Kashmir, and other districts of Punjab come here for treatment, placing an overwhelming burden on the city’s limited healthcare system,” he said. “I request the Prime Minister to pay special attention to this issue in this budget.”\nOn education, he noted that many schools in Islamabad are facing serious challenges. “There is a dire need to improve the infrastructure of schools and recruit more teachers to uplift the standard of education,” he said.\nRaja Khurram also highlighted the neglect of rural areas within Islamabad. “Basic amenities are lacking in these regions. The budget should allocate more funds for their development,” he said.\nWater scarcity was another major concern, he said adding “Both of Islamabad’s main dams are facing shortages, creating serious difficulties for residents. This issue must be addressed in the budget.”\nHe further pointed out the lack of industrial development in Islamabad and the ongoing ban on new gas connections, which has been in place for three years. “Industrialization is crucial for economic growth and employment, and the gas connection issue needs an immediate resolution,” he suggested.\nMember of the National Assembly Asad Alam Niazi underlined the need for prompt action on several national issues, ranging from infrastructure development and food security to energy production and economic policy negotiations.\nNiazi stated that the proposal to rename Islamabad Airport as “Benazir Bhutto International Airport” has already been approved by the relevant committee. “A formal notification should be issued without delay to implement this decision,” he urged.\nTurning to Pakistan’s ongoing negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Niazi stressed the importance of broad political participation. “Representatives from all political parties and provincial chief ministers should be included in IMF meetings so they can speak on behalf of their provinces,” he said.\nExpressing concern over regional development, Niazi pointed out the omission of funding for the “Hyderabad-Sukkur Motorway” in the current budget. “This crucial infrastructure project has been ignored, which is a matter of concern,” he added. He also highlighted the worsening “water crisis in Karachi”, calling for immediate government intervention to address the issue.\nDiscussing Pakistan’s energy potential, Niazi hailed the development of a “wind energy project in Sindh”, which is currently producing 2,700 megawatts of electricity. “If further developed, this project could generate even more low-cost electricity and help reduce our reliance on expensive energy sources,” he said.\nOn the issue of agriculture, Niazi urged the government to “purchase wheat from local farmers” and provide them with greater financial and policy support. “Farmers are the backbone of our economy. The government must stand with them, especially during tough times,” he added.\nHe said that budget allocation is insufficient for climate change and food security, two sectors he termed as “critically important and facing serious challenges.” Niazi called on the government to prioritize these areas in order to ensure long-term national stability.\nMNA Riaz Ftyana said “I salute our armed forces for delivering a decisive blow to aggression from India. Their bravery speaks for every Pakistani.”\nHe continued, praising Pakistan’s representatives at the United Nations and in the United Kingdom. “Their diplomatic efforts reflect true dedication,” he said, “and we must acknowledge their contributions.”\nTalking on the budget, he said that in my constituency, Sahiwal, Chichawatni, Kamalia, and Shorkot, motorway “has been overlooked in the current budget. No allocation for the motorway that connects our people, no steps toward upgrading the railway services. Our development has been paused — and it’s time it was resumed.” Gas connections remained uninstalled, projects half-completed. “We are not asking for favors,” he said. “We are asking for our right to be part of a growing Pakistan.”\nTurning his attention to the national economy, he said “Our expenses continue to outweigh our income. This imbalance threatens our future.”\nSpeaking about emerging economies around the world, he talked about the nations that had transformed themselves through vision, discipline, and capable leadership. “We need qualified economists in the government,” he stressed, “individuals educated in their field and proven in their practice.”\nHe said “There must be mental health services and youth centers established across Pakistan,”. “Our future depends on how we nurture our youth in body, mind, and spirit.”\nMember of Parliament Arshad Abdullah Vohra said the deteriorating industrial sector and the disproportionate budgetary allocation to Karachi, the country’s financial hub is not acceptable.\nSpeaking on the floor, Vohra said, *“The industrial sector is collapsing. Over the last ten years, no new industries have been established, and existing ones are shutting down. This sector urgently needs attention.”\nHe also criticized K-Electric, the main power utility in Karachi, for continuing with prolonged load-shedding. “K-Electric must eliminate load-shedding. It has enough funds to improve power supply, yet the people suffer daily,” he added.\nVohra highlighted regional budget disparities, stating that Punjab receives 55% of the national budget, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 15%, and Sindh only 25%. “Karachi generates a major portion of the country’s revenue, but its share in the budget is minimal. This is unjust to the people of Karachi,” he asserted.\nHe further expressed dissatisfaction over the delayed completion of the Green Line bus project in Karachi and called for immediate action to transform the city into a ‘Safe City’ through improved security infrastructure. “I appeal the Prime Minister to focus on Karachi’s development and ensure justice is done to its people,” Vohra said.\nMember of National Assembly (MNA) Ali Zahid has the government for presenting a “pro-people and balanced” budget despite challenging economic conditions. He also congratulated the government, highlighting its recent decision to reduce electricity prices by Rs. 7 per unit. “This move will help stabilize the economy and protect local industries from collapse,” he said.\nHe further pointed to positive signs from international economic institutions, which have indicated a decline in inflation and gradual economic recovery in Pakistan. “I am hopeful that Pakistan will soon emerge as a strong economy,” he added.\nOn foreign policy and defense matters, Zahid strongly condemned recent statements made by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi regarding Pakistan, calling them “an act of aggression.” He said that India had received a “strong and appropriate” response from Pakistan during recent aggression.\nReferring to historical actions taken during the tenure of former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, Zahid emphasized Pakistan’s defense advancements, particularly the development of the JF-17 Thunder fighter jets in collaboration with China, and the nuclear tests conducted in response to India’s provocations. “Despite facing sanctions and imprisonment, Nawaz Sharif prioritized national defense,” Zahid noted.\nHe also criticized previous governments poor foreign policy as when Pakistan was linking to terrorism at international forums such as the United Nations. “That was a reflection of their incompetence,” he said adding, due to current government’s diplomatic efforts, which Pakistan’s image globally improved.\nHe also condemned the ongoing Israeli aggression in Gaza, expressing solidarity with the Palestinian people and calling for an end to the violence.\nSenior politician and Member of the National Assembly, Shehryar Afridi, said that the primary objective of the national budget should be the welfare of the people, especially the underprivileged segments of society.\nAfridi said that the government must focus on addressing the basic needs of the poor and marginalized when drafting financial plans. “The budget should reflect the real needs of the common man. It must be rooted in compassion and social justice,” he stated.\nHe also underlined the importance of consultation with all stakeholders, including political parties, in the budget-making process. “It is essential to engage every relevant unit, particularly political parties to ensure that the budget is inclusive, transparent, and representative of the people’s aspirations,” Afridi added.\nParticipating in the budget debate, Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) lawmaker Aasia Ishaque Siddiqui commended the government for providing relief to salaried class and presenting a balanced budget for 2025–26\ndespite ongoing financial challenges.\nShe emphasized the need for enhanced budgetary allocations to critical sectors such as healthcare, climate change,\nand women empowerment.\nAasia Ishaque also urged the government to reconsider the General Sales Tax (GST) on solar panels, saying that people in areas without access to electricity, should be able to benefit from solar energy systems.\nSunni Ittehad Council (SIC) MNA Sher Afzal Khan also called for higher budgetary allocations, particularly for the information technology, health, and education sectors.\nSher Afzal highlighted that youth make up 60 percent of Pakistan’s population but regretted lack of adequate funding for their development.\nHe recommended a review of the export policy to enhance exports and attract foreign investment, which would help boost national revenue for public welfare.\nPakistan People’s Party Parliamentarians (PPPP) legislator Dr. Mahesh Kumar Malani lauded the government and paid tribute to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir and the Pakistan Armed Forces for their firm response to Indian aggression.\nHe also applauded PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari for promoting a positive image of Pakistan internationally in the aftermath of these events.\nDr. Mahesh Malani strongly condemned the Israeli attack on innocent civilians in Iran and expressed solidarity with the country, saying that the entire Pakistani nation and Parliament stand united with Iran in this critical hour.\nHe reiterated the PPP’s opposition to the GST on solar panels and called for increased funding for the Higher Education Commission to support academic development in the country.\nSpecial Assistant to Prime Minister Mubarak Zeb on Tribal Affairs expressed deep concern over the deteriorating security situation in the region, saying that “We talk about lawlessness, but the reality is that we face bomb blasts and rocket attacks on a daily basis.”\nHe said that his house was attacked by some culprits for second time within a month. “Sixteen months ago, my brother Rehan Zeb was martyred, but justice has yet to be served. The culprits remain at large,” he added.\nMubarak Zeb vowed to realize the vision of development for Bajaur, saying, “The dream we saw for the progress of Bajaur will be fulfilled.”\nHe called for the formation of a high-level investigation committee to probe the murder of his brother and the attacks on his residence. “A thorough investigation must be conducted to identify and punish those responsible,” he said.\nSIC MNA, Rana Atif criticized the federal budget 2025-26, saying that the situation in the country was better during their tenure and that the power to arrest over tax evasion should be withdrawn.\nPakistan Muslim League legislator, Farakh Khan called for electricity tax relief for families with minimal consumption, such as those using only one fan and one light bulb.\nEmphasizing women empowerment, she urged the government to take special initiatives to financially support women and advocated for a 15-20 percent employment quota for educated women.\nFarakh Khan also proposed the establishment of daycare centers across the country and praised the Speaker of the\nNational Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq for facilitating a daycare center within Parliament House.\nShe also commended the increase in the defense budget, saying that the sacrifices of soldiers cannot be measured in monetary terms. “We must reflect on what we have truly given back to Pakistan,” she added.\nPML-N MNA, Kiran Haider highlighted that the budget laid the foundation for national development and prosperity, crediting Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership for navigating the country through economic challenges.\nShe reminded the House that the country was on the brink of default when the current government took the charge.
