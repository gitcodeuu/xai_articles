  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 16 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister/ Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar on Monday expressed deep concern in the Senate over the spread of false information and AI-generated content on social media after the June 13 events, warning that such misinformation could threaten national security and undermine diplomatic efforts.\nIshaq Dar said that a widely circulated interview of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, purported to be recent, was in fact from 2011. “Such deceptive content is causing confusion and is being monitored closely by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,” he told the House.\nHe pointed to a fabricated news graphic that falsely claimed Pakistan could have 70% of its debt written off by rolling back its nuclear program. “This is a blatant lie and a product of artificial intelligence,” he said, also flagging a manipulated video involving  Defence Minister Khawaja Asif and U.S. President Donald Trump as another example of digital misinformation.\nHe urged the public and media to exercise caution. “This is a sensitive time; spreading fake content can be disastrous,” he emphasized.\nRegarding Pakistan’s role in de-escalating tensions between Iran and the U.S., Dar revealed that the foreign ministers of Iran and Oman kept Pakistan in the loop during the negotiations. “Four rounds of talks were held in Muscat and Rome,” he said.\nDar noted that because Iran is not a member of the United Nations, Pakistan facilitated a UN Security Council meeting. “Iran formally thanked Pakistan, Russia, China, and Algeria for standing with them diplomatically,” he added.\nHe said that Iran had conveyed its intention to retaliate after the attack but also expressed willingness to resume dialogue if Israel refrained from further aggression.\nIn response to the Iran-Israel conflict, Dar said Pakistan had taken swift steps to assist its nationals. “We established a Crisis Management Unit in the Foreign Office and activated a 24/7 hotline at our embassy in Tehran,” he said, adding that 251 Pakistani students in Iran are being brought back to Quetta.\nHe said over 500 Pakistani pilgrims in Iraq were also being assisted, including 209 who had traveled by road, and arrangements were being made for their safe return.\nDar shared that Iran requested Pakistan’s help in repatriating around 20,000 Iranian Hajj pilgrims currently in Saudi Arabia. “We assured them that these pilgrims would be received in Karachi and sent back with full honor—they are our guests,” he stated.\nSaudi Arabia has also announced that these Iranian pilgrims would remain as guests until conditions stabilize, he added.\nDar strongly refuted a fake video being circulated on social media that falsely quoted an Iranian general as saying Pakistan would attack Israel if Iran was targeted. “This is completely false and artificial; even the Daily Mail picked it up. It’s dangerous and irresponsible,” he warned.\nReflecting on Pakistan’s nuclear history, he reminded the House of the 1998 nuclear tests. “At the time, regional peace and security made it necessary. It was a bold decision taken by former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif,” he said\nDar said India later requested a ceasefire in recent years, underscoring Pakistan’s position of strength. “We are neither signatories to the NPT, nor are India and Israel. National defense is our sovereign right,” he declared.\nHe also cautioned against any attack on nuclear facilities, warning that targeting the nuclear assets of any country would not only violate Article 51 of the United Nations Charter but would also amount to a serious international crime. “Such an act could result in catastrophic consequences for regional and global peace,” he said.\nIn reply to a question from Opposition Leader of Senate, Senator Shibli Faraz, Dar said: “We do not take any news or situation lightly. The nation is united, and if anyone casts an evil eye on Pakistan, we will respond with full force. Our nuclear assets are national assets—built through great sacrifice—and we will safeguard them at all costs.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
