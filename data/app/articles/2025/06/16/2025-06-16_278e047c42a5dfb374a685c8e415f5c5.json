  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 16 (APP): Federal Minister for Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, SAFRON Engineer Amir Muqam has said that Chief Minister KPK Ali Amin Gandapur keeps calling for protests to keep his party and government’s declining reputation alive, his protest will also fail like the previous two protests, he is making fun of the people by asking them to take the approval of the province’s budget from the founder PTI.\nSpeaking to “APP” in his chamber at the Parliament House on Monday, Engineer Amir Muqam said that the people of KP should be given relief in the provincial budget, so far the Chief Minister is talking about budget approval from the founder PTI, which is a complete joke with the people, “the founder PTI is in jail for his corruption, nor is he a member of any assembly, so it is foolish to talk about taking the approval of the budget from him”.\nHe said that in fact, he is left with only words to give relief to the people in the budget.\nIn response to a question, he said that by repeatedly calling for protests, Ali Amin Gandapur keeps on giving oxygen to the declining reputation of his party and the government, the protest call will fail like the previous protests.\nHe said that we have not allowed any new tax to be imposed on the people of the merged districts of FATA and PATA, 10 percent sales tax is imposed on raw materials, regarding which it is said that the goods made from this imported raw material are sold in other populated areas.\nMuqam said that we have also proposed steps to provide relief to FATA and PATA from the federal government in the current budget. He said that a political group is creating a false narrative to mislead the public for point scoring.\nHe said that this is the same party that has imposed sales tax on services in areas like Malakand, Bajaur, Swat, and\nKhyber through CAPRA since July 25, 2023 and it is now trying unsuccessfully to become an angel in front of the public.\nHe said that if he really sympathizes with the people of FATA and PATA, he should get his government to abolish the taxes imposed by CAPRA. The people have rejected his false narrative before and will not listen to his propaganda in the future either.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
