  "content": "PESHAWAR, Jun 11 (APP): The Speaker Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly paid no heed to the pinpointing of the lack of quorum in the House and continued the proceedings on Wednesday.\nThe House resumed proceedings of the session convened on the requisition of the legislators of the ruling party. However, it also kept its traditions of delaying in the beginning of the proceedings by three hours.\nSoon after recitation from the Holy Qur’aan, PML-N woman legislature Sobia Shahid pinpointed the lack of quorum. But the Speaker Babar Saleem told her to let him announce the panel of chairmen and petition committee before counting the members. On counting, the House was found in order, however, she continued pinpointing the quorum.\nMeanwhile, Daud Shah, a member of the panel of chairmen took the chair, but Sobia Shahid continuously pinpointed the quorum. However, he paid no heed to her point of order and said that the members have been counted for three times and the house has been found is in order.\nThe consecutive pinpointing of the quorum angered the Provincial Minister for Law Aftab Alam and other members of the treasury benches. However, at the same moment several treasury members come of the lobby and took their seats in the house. The treasury benches welcome them by thumping their desks and after the counting the House found in order.\nThe House adopted the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sentencing (Amendment) Bill, 2025 and the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Commission on the Status of Women (Amendment) Bill, 2025 by majority.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
