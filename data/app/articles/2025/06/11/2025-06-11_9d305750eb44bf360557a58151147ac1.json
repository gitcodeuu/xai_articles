It hampers their development and poses a serious obstacle to national progress.\nIn his message on World Day Against Child Labour, the minister said, “I reaffirm the Government of Pakistan’s strong commitment to eliminating child labour in all its forms. In line with our Constitution and international obligations, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, we continue to take concrete steps to safeguard the rights and dignity of every child.”\nHe said the Ministry of Human Rights, together with the National Commission on the Rights of the Child, is actively engaged in policy development, awareness campaigns, and monitoring mechanisms to address this issue.\nI call upon all sectors, government, civil society, private institutions and communities, to work collectively to eliminate child labour and ensure a safer, brighter future for our children, he added.",
