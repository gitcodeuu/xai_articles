  "content": "LONDON, June 11 (APP): Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Chairman and head of high-level parliamentary delegation Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, on Wednesday said India’s narrative was based on ‘lies and propaganda,’ while Pakistan’s stance was rooted in’truth and peace.’\nHe criticized India for using terrorism as a foreign policy tool and pointed out that Indian agencies had been targeting Sikh activists around the world.\nSpeaking at a press conference along with delegation members, Bilawal said US President Trump’s multiple offers of mediation reflected his desire to establish peace between Pakistan and India. However, he regretted that Indian government seemed to be sabotaging such efforts.\nHe welcomed the US State Department’s recent statement, highlighting former President Donald Trump’s willingness to mediate Kashmir issue during his tenure.\n“Pakistan has always sought peace through dialogue and diplomacy,” Bilawal said, emphasising that resolving all outstanding issues, including Jammu and Kashmir dispute, must come through peaceful negotiations.\nHe stressed that lasting peace between Pakistan and India was in the interest of international community.\nBilawal asserted that India had repeatedly failed to produce credible evidence to support its terrorism allegations against Pakistan. “Despite our continuous demands, India has not been able to prove any of its claims,” he said.\nHe said : “India knows well that Pakistan has no links with terrorism. Its efforts to malign us will fail, and we will continue to pursue peace in the region.”\nHe further said that Pakistan sought peaceful solutions to all disputes — Kashmir, and water issues — through dialogue.\nBilawal said: “Even President Trump acknowledged that dialogue on Kashmir is essential. If the U.S. must push India to the negotiating table, it should, because peace is in the world’s best interest.”\nBilawal also condemned India’s reported campaign against Sikh communities abroad and its involvement in terrorism within Pakistan. “We call on India to stop sponsoring terrorism beyond its borders,” he added.\nHe warned that India’s threats to cut off water supplies to Pakistan were a violation of UN Charter.\nCommenting on Pakistan’s recent security achievements, Bilawal said: “The recent conflict has shown that even as a smaller nation, Pakistan has the strength to defend itself on all fronts.”\nHe said that elevation of Asim Munir to the rank of Field Marshal was a recognition of his leadership and Pakistan’s military success in recent standoff with India.",
