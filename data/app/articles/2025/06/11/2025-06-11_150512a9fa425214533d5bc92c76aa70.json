Firefighting teams launched an operation to control the blaze, which had started in a forested section of the hills.\nAccording to a spokesperson of the district administration, over 50 firefighters were actively involved in the operation. The official expressed confidence that the fire would be brought under control soon. The cause of the fire had not been confirmed at the time of reporting.\nThe Margalla Hills, which attract visitors year-round for hiking and picnicking, often face fire incidents during dry weather. Authorities believe many of these fires are linked to human activities, particularly careless disposal of burning material or  bonfires.\nThe incident has occurred just days after Eid-ul-Azha, when families often head to the hills and green belts for barbecues and picnics. In light of the fire and rising temperatures, the district administration has reinforced restrictions already in place to prevent such gatherings in sensitive forest areas.\nThe spokesperson said that Section 144 has been imposed, banning barbecues and bonfires in all green belts and across the Margalla Hills National Park.
