BISP will take strict legal action against any form of malpractice.”\nShe also underscored the importance of efficiency in service delivery, directing that only those beneficiaries who receive a payment notification via 8171 should approach the campsites. “Given limited resources, repeated surveys are not feasible,” she stated, instructing staff to place clear and informative banners at each site to ensure transparency.\nAt the Village Council Office Togh Bala, Senator Rubina Khalid directed BISP staff to provide attentive and respectful support to all beneficiaries, ensuring a seamless and dignified experience for the deserving women.\nLater, Senator Rubina Khalid met with Deputy Commissioner Kohat, Mr. Abdul Akram, to review arrangements at BISP campsites.\nThe meeting focused on improving facilities such as shaded waiting areas, clean drinking water, and enhanced cooperation from partner banks to ensure optimal service delivery. The Deputy Commissioner assured full support and presented a commemorative shield to the Chairperson in recognition of her efforts.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
