He further urged the government to create an enabling environment for the business community, particularly by facilitating investment in the manufacturing sector.\nHe welcomed the government’s recently announced five-year tariff reform plan, describing it as a “transformative initiative” with the potential to boost Pakistan’s exports by several billion dollars—provided it is implemented transparently and in alignment with market needs.\nQureshi also underscored the need to simplify regulations, streamline business licensing procedures, and reduce bureaucratic hurdles to improve the overall investment climate.\nHighlighting the pivotal role of youth and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), he called for targeted support in areas such as skills development, technology adoption, and access to global markets to unlock Pakistan’s full economic potential.\nHe congratulated Muhammad Anwar, CEO of FGP, and his team for launching Freedom Gate Dialogues, expressing hope that the podcast will raise awareness on critical economic and development issues and promote informed public discourse.\nQureshi also mentioned the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) recently signed between ICCI and FGP to advance shared goals in economic empowerment and climate change resilience.\nThe episode further highlighted ICCI’s ongoing initiatives to foster public-private partnerships, improve industrial infrastructure, and ensure effective representation of the business community’s interests in policymaking.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
