  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 15 (APP): World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD) was observed on Sunday to focus on the abuse of older adults in long-term care facilities.\nThe Day aims to highlight the necessity of protecting and supporting older individuals during emergencies, such as natural disasters, pandemics, and conflicts.\nThe theme of the day this year is “Addressing Abuse of Older Adults in Long Term Care Facilities: Through Data and Action”.\nThe Day was officially recognized by the United Nations General Assembly in its resolution, December 2011, following a request by the International Network for the Prevention of Elder Abuse (INPEA) to commemorate in June. It represents the one day in the year when the whole world voices its opposition to the abuse and suffering inflicted to some of our older generations.\nElder abuse can be defined as “a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person”.\nIt is a global social issue which affects the Health and Human Rights of millions of older persons around the world and an issue which deserves the attention of the international community.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
