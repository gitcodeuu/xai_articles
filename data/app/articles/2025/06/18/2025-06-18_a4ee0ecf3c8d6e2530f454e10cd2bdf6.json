  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP): Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change, Romina Khurshid Alam on Wednesday expressed that Pakistan sees the Global Development Initiative (GDI) not merely as a global framework but as an intrinsic element of its national development strategy—one that emphasizes public accountability, equity, and ownership by the people through their elected representatives.\nAddressing a seminar on “Global Development Initiative in Pakistan: A Parliamentary Roadmap for Shared Prosperity,” she underscored the significance of the event as the realization of a long-held vision.\nShe described it as the embodiment of years of commitment as a legislator, development advocate, and a dedicated partner in the evolving parliamentary diplomacy between Pakistan and China.\nReflecting on the origins of the GDI, she recalled the powerful moment when Chinese President Xi Jinping introduced the initiative at the United Nations General Assembly in 2021, calling for development to be a universal right rather than a selective privilege. That message, she said, deeply resonated with her, especially in her capacity as a woman parliamentarian from the Global South, where development needs are acute and the aspirations of people are high.\nAs both Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change and Convener of the Pakistan-China Parliamentary Friendship Group, she embarked on extensive consultations with stakeholders including policymakers, youth leaders, international experts, and civil society. The outcome of these engagements made it clear that for the GDI to be truly effective in Pakistan, it must be grounded in parliamentary processes and democratic institutions.\nAs Pakistan approaches 75 years of diplomatic relations with China, she highlighted how the relationship has matured into a comprehensive partnership that not only strengthens bilateral ties but also serves as a beacon of solidarity in the Global South.\nThis enduring friendship, she noted, has transitioned from strategic cooperation to practical collaboration, as demonstrated by initiatives like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and the solar-powered Parliament, projects that have tangibly uplifted institutions and communities.\nThe GDI now marks the expansion of this partnership into new domains of development cooperation, education, digital access, climate justice, and public health.\nShe emphasized, GDI stands as a global platform for South-South cooperation and a practical response to the development challenges that many nations face, particularly those with aspirations but limited means.\nRomima Khursheed commended China’s leadership in creating tools like the Global Development and South-South Cooperation Fund and the GDI Implementation Framework at the UN.\nPakistan, she said, takes pride in standing shoulder-to-shoulder with China to promote development justice.\nA national program is being launched to embed the GDI across Pakistan’s legislative, academic, and civic sectors. With multi-party consensus, this program aims to mainstream GDI through policy dialogues, public outreach, youth and academic engagement, human security frameworks, and strengthened parliamentary cooperation with China.\nShe concluded by affirming that this is more than a symbolic launch. It marks the beginning of a transformative chapter in Pakistan-China relations and a global model of localizing international cooperation through democracy.",
