Both organizations have reached a consensus on the equivalence of competency assessments, evaluation procedures, and quality assurance systems, which will significantly streamline accreditation for professional engineers from both countries.\nThe agreement is set to provide a skilled and certified workforce vital for the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and other joint initiatives under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\nThis further reinforces the robust partnership between China and Pakistan in engineering and technological development.\nDuring the forum, participants also adopted the “Consensus on Belt and Road Engineering Capacity Building,” which underscored the importance of skills development, standardization, and international cooperation in engineering. The event drew over 160 representatives from six international organizations and 26 national engineering bodies, alongside leading experts from academia and industry.\nTo mark this historic agreement, Mr. Wang, President of the China Society for Engineers (CSE), presented a commemorative souvenir to Engr. Waseem Nazir, Chairman of the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC).\nThe significance of this milestone in Pak-China engineering relations was underscored by the presence of Engr. Dr. Nasir Mahmood Khan, Secretary/Registrar, Pakistan Engineering Council, Mr. Zang Bin, Deputy Secretary-General, Chinese Society of Engineers, and Engr. Sohail Khan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
