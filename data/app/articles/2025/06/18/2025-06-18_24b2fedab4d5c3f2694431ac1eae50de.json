  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP): Chairperson Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), Senator Rubina Khalid, has termed the upcoming Benazir Hunarmand Program (BHP) a timely and strategic intervention to address Pakistan’s growing employment challenges and unlock economic opportunities for underprivileged communities.\nShe expressed these views during a meeting with the Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, Chaudhry Salik Hussain, at his office in Islamabad. Senator Rubina Khalid briefed the Minister on the vision and scope of BHP and extended a formal invitation for its launch ceremony, scheduled to be held at Aiwan-e-Sadr on June 21.\nHighlighting the importance of skill development, Senator Rubina Khalid said with a rising young population and limited employment avenues, especially for marginalized groups, Pakistan urgently needs initiatives that provide sustainable solutions.\n“BHP is not just a training initiative—it is a pathway to dignity, self-reliance, and decent work. By equipping low-income families with market-relevant, competency-based skills, we are investing in their future and in the economic progress of the country,” she remarked.\nShe explained that the program aims to train BISP beneficiaries and their family members in skills aligned with both local market needs and international demand—particularly in sectors like construction, healthcare, hospitality, and information technology.\nA key focus of the initiative is to prepare participants for employment opportunities in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and beyond.\nMinister Salik Hussain lauded the Chairperson’s efforts to move beyond traditional financial assistance by offering transformative skill-building opportunities under BISP.\n“This is a step in the right direction. Instead of only giving financial support, BISP is now creating avenues for long-term empowerment. Skill development leads to self-sufficiency, and that is what we need at this stage,” he stated.\nHe assured full support from his ministry to help link BHP graduates with international employment opportunities.\nThe Minister emphasized that platforms like the Overseas Employment Corporation (OEC) and licensed foreign employment promoters could play a crucial role in job placements abroad.\nSalik Hussain also committed to sharing real-time international labour market data with BISP during the training phase, to ensure that the program’s curriculum matches global workforce demands.\nHe stressed the importance of partnering with institutions whose certifications are internationally recognized,thereby improving the employability and competitiveness of BHP graduates.\nBoth leaders agreed to institutionalize collaboration between BISP and the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis by nominating focal persons from both sides. These designated officials will coordinate efforts to identify overseas demand, align skill training accordingly, and ensure effective follow-up and placement support.\nThis partnership is expected to create thousands of job opportunities for individuals from low-income families, empowering them to break the cycle of poverty and contribute meaningfully to the national economy.\nThe initiative reflects a shared commitment to human capital development and a future-oriented approach to welfare.\nThe Benazir Hunarmand Program will be formally launched at a high-level event on June 21 at the Presidency, with participation from government officials, international partners, training institutions, and private sector representatives.",
