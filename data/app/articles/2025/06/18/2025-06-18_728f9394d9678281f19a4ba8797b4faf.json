  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 18 (APP):Minister of State for Climate Change, Dr. Shezra Mansab Ali Khan Kharal, emphasized the critical role of data-driven decision-making in Pakistan’s water and climate policies during the launch of three innovative digital platforms on Wednesday.\nThe tools, developed by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), aim to enhance water, food, and energy security amid growing climate challenges.\nThe newly introduced platforms—Water Productivity Atlas, Water Body Inventory of Pakistan, and Hydro-Economic Model for the Indus Basin—were unveiled at a national workshop in Islamabad.\nThe event, centered on the Water, Energy, Food, and Environment (WEFE) Nexus, was organized by IWMI and CGIAR, with support from the UK’s Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO).\nDr. Kharal praised the initiative, stating that these digital tools would enable evidence-based policymaking and improve transparency in resource management.\n“Access to real-time data is crucial for effective planning, especially as Pakistan faces increasing climate vulnerabilities.\nThese platforms will help balance competing demands across water, agriculture, and energy sectors while ensuring environmental sustainability,” she said.\nShe stressed the need for inter-ministerial collaboration, urging provincial and federal stakeholders to adopt a unified approach to climate resilience.\nFederal Secretary for Water Resources, Syed Ali Murtaza, highlighted the growing strain on Pakistan’s water resources due to transboundary tensions with India and inefficient usage.\n“Better planning is essential to optimize water distribution and support our agricultural backbone,” he said, endorsing the new tools as a step toward smarter resource allocation.\nDr. Mohsin Hafeez, IWMI’s Director, emphasized that Pakistan must move away from soiled approaches to water, food, and energy management.\n“These sectors are interlinked—climate resilience requires systemic solutions,” he asserted.\nAnna Balance, Senior Climate Lead at FCDO, reaffirmed the UK’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s climate resilience through programs like the Water Resource Accountability in Pakistan (WRAP).\n“We encourage ministries to collaborate, scale up these tools, and build institutional capacity for long-term sustainability,” she said.\nDr. Mark Smith, IWMI’s Director General, called for stronger partnerships between scientists, policymakers, and government agencies.\n“This workshop is just the beginning—sustained action is needed to turn research into policy,”* he remarked.\nRepresentatives from Punjab, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shared insights on improving local water management through data-driven strategies.\nThe event also saw the launch of two new CGIAR global science programs—Policy Innovations and Climate Action—aimed at strengthening climate and agricultural policies.\nDr. Muhammad Ashraf, IWMI’s Pakistan Country Head, urged continued engagement beyond the workshop.\n“These tools must be integrated into government planning and investment frameworks to ensure lasting impact,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
