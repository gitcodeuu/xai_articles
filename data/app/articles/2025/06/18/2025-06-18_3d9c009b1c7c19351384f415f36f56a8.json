He expressed his intent to benefit from the institution’s expertise in marine sciences and maritime education to build awareness and capacity at the grassroots level.\n“Our goal is to promote inclusive development by enabling access to quality education for youth from over 70 coastal and fishing communities, especially in Sindh and Balochistan,” said the Minister. “This is essential for cultivating a skilled maritime workforce that will serve as a foundation for Pakistan’s blue economy.”\nIn line with this vision, the Minister announced the launch of the Maritime Educational Endowment Fund (MEEF), a new initiative aimed at providing scholarships to deserving and talented students from coastal regions.
