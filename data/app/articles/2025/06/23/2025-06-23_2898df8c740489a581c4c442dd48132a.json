They told the court that the case had gained widespread media attention, and the accused was being denied access to his family.\nIn response, the judge remarked that since the suspect had now been sent on judicial remand, such meetings could take place in jail under standard procedures.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
