Student enrolment increased from 1.1 million to 1.65 million; a 47% growth, and faculty strength grew from 27,633 to over 38,000, marking a 39% increase. These figures illustrate a deliberate policy focus that places education, innovation, and access at the core of Pakistan’s national development strategy.\nProf. Iqbal championed the expansion of universities in underserved regions, including Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan, Azad Jammu & Kashmir, and other remote areas, ensuring that education is no longer a privilege for the few but a right for all, regardless of geography, gender, or background. His focus on inclusive access also extended to women and minority communities, strengthening key development indicators and aligning Pakistan’s education system with international equity goals.\nAs early as 1998, Prof. Iqbal launched a game-changing initiative to award 5,000 overseas and 5,000 local Ph.D. scholarships in science and technology, laying the foundation for a new generation of researchers, scientists, and faculty.\nSubsequently, he spearheaded the establishment of the Pakistan-U.S. Knowledge Corridor, aimed at training 10,000 Pakistani Ph.D. candidates at top U.S. universities.\nHis investment in IT and cyber technologies has created a strong cadre of professionals who now contribute to global digital ecosystems and protect Pakistan’s cyber frontiers in an increasingly complex digital battlefield.\nThrough Vision 2010, Vision 2025, and now Uraan Pakistan, Prof. Iqbal has consistently prioritised education, science, and innovation in his planning philosophy.\nHe pioneered the establishment of National Centres of Excellence in AI, Robotics, Big Data, Space Science, Cybersecurity, and Genomics via university consortia, thereby creating bridges between scientific research and industrial innovation.\nMore recently, he has led the development of cutting-edge institutions such as the National Center for Nanotechnology, the Center for New Manufacturing, and the Center for Quantum Computing, laying the groundwork for Pakistan to compete in the Fourth and Fifth Industrial Revolutions.\nHis most recent visionary initiative is the launch of Quantum Valley, which is set to become a national innovation ecosystem inspired by Silicon Valley, designed to align academia, government, finance, and industry under a unified tech agenda. Supporting this vision, a national venture capital fund has been rolled out to unlock deep-tech entrepreneurship and support the commercialisation of R&D.\nThis recognition by ICESCO follows recent international accolades, including the 2024 Asian Productivity Organisation’s Distinguished Award, presented in Kuala Lumpur, which places him among only five Asian leaders to receive such an honour for innovation-led, inclusive development.\nAs per the citation issued by ICESCO Prof. Iqbal as “a true architect of Pakistan’s resilient, knowledge-powered future” and praised his “rare synthesis of vision, planning discipline, and reformist courage.” This honour represents more than a personal milestone for Prof. Ahsan Iqbal; it reflects the growing international recognition of Pakistan’s leadership in advancing education, innovation, and inclusive development. It underscores the enduring value of long-term public service and the belief that genuine progress stems from investing in people, their intellect, potential, and opportunities.\nProf. Iqbal’s journey provides a compelling example of what sustained vision and commitment can achieve for a nation.\nProf. Ahsan Iqbal expressed his deep gratitude to Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, noting that such recognition for Pakistan was only possible under the Prime Minister’s visionary leadership and steadfast support for a knowledge-driven development agenda.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
