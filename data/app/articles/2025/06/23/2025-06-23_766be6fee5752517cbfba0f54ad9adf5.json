  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP): The Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration has warned residents and builders against starting any kind of construction — residential or commercial — without official approval.\nIn this regard, the Deputy Commissioner has made it clear: building without permission may lead to legal consequences, including jail time, said the spokesman of ICT administration here.\nThe district administration of Islamabad has issued a clear directive: no construction can take place in the federal capital without prior approval from the Capital Development Authority (CDA). Whether it’s a small renovation or the construction of a multi-storey commercial building, proper permits are mandatory.\nMeanwhile, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon said that the city administration will take legal action against anyone involved in unauthorized construction activities. These actions will not only target property owners but also the labourers working on such sites.\n“Both the person who owns the property and those carrying out the work will be held accountable,” said the Deputy Commissioner, adding that relevant magistrates have been directed to enforce the law without delay.\nThe warning extends beyond construction sites. Businesses that sell construction material without verifying the builder’s official permission will also face legal consequences. “Anyone selling building materials to those without proper approval will be considered a part of the violation,” said Memon.\nThis move is part of the administration’s efforts to control unregulated development in Islamabad. In many areas, buildings are constructed without proper layout approval, safety checks, or environmental assessment, putting residents at risk and disturbing planned urban development.\nExplaining the seriousness of the matter, officials drew comparisons to building without a foundation — not just risky for those living in it but also harmful for the surrounding area. Unauthorized buildings can affect drainage systems, block roads, and pose safety risks.\nThe Deputy Commissioner has urged residents to follow the proper legal process before starting any construction. “We request citizens not to become part of any construction activity unless the required permissions are obtained,” he said.\nCDA officials confirmed that the permission process includes structural checks, adherence to zoning laws, and compliance with environmental regulations. This process ensures that new buildings are safe and fit within Islamabad’s master plan.\nResidents and builders are advised to contact the CDA before beginning construction projects. Details about the approval process and required documents are available on the CDA’s official website and help desks.\nIn recent months, the city administration has intensified its efforts to regulate construction practices in Islamabad. Several illegal constructions have been sealed or demolished, and multiple FIRs have been registered.\nOfficials believe that this strict approach will encourage lawful building practices and help maintain Islamabad’s urban infrastructure. The administration also plans to carry out regular inspections in housing societies, commercial areas, and developing sectors.\nThe Deputy Commissioner stressed the importance of public cooperation. “This is not just about following rules. It’s about building a safer, more organized city. Every resident has a role to play in keeping Islamabad’s future secure,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
