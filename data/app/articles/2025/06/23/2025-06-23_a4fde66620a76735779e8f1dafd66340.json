  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP):To strengthen Pakistan’s technical and vocational education landscape, a high-profile Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signing ceremony was held on Monday at the National Skills University Islamabad (NSU), presided over by Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training, Dr. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui.\nThe event marks a significant chapter in Pakistan’s pursuit of technology-integrated skills development, fostering international collaboration in vocational and professional training.\nIn addition to senior faculty members and administrative staff from the University, a four-member delegation from Tongwon University, Republic of Korea, visited NSU to explore potential academic and training partnerships in various technology domains.\nThe Korean delegation emphasized the importance of Korean language proficiency as a prerequisite for education in Korea, underscoring that Pakistani students who meet this requirement could benefit from Korea’s ‘earn and learn’ model. This model, which combines vocational training with work opportunities, has garnered success and popularity in several countries, providing students with practical experience and a source of income while they study.\nIn his address, Federal Minister Dr. Siddiqui expressed appreciation for the Korean delegation’s interest in Pakistan and welcomed further engagements in skills development. “The Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training is fully committed to advancing technology-oriented training, especially in fields aligned with the fourth industrial revolution,” he said. “We recognize the role of international partnerships in helping Pakistan’s youth tap into global job markets while acquiring world-class competencies.”\nThe Minister also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to enhancing cooperation with institutions such as NAVTTC (National Vocational and Technical Training Commission) and other development partners. These institutions play a crucial role in the development and implementation of vocational training programs, and their collaboration with NSU and Tongwon University will further strengthen the vocational education landscape in Pakistan.\nHis presence at the ceremony, in the capacity of Pro-Chancellor of NSU, was hailed as a historic moment by Prof. Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar, Vice Chancellor of NSU.\n“This is a defining occasion for NSU,” said Prof. Mukhtar. “The Pro-Chancellor himself presiding over today’s session reflects the government’s genuine interest in uplifting the technical and vocational training sector in Pakistan.”\nProf. Mukhtar also highlighted the university’s ongoing progress, particularly the growing footprint of NSU through its sub-campus in Muridke, which aims to cater to the underserved youth of Punjab by offering industry-relevant certifications and degrees.\nProf. Mukhtar also praised the Federal Minister’s initiative of establishing the eagerly awaited National Skills University Islamabad Campus in Karachi.\nThe collaboration with Tongwon University could serve as a template for how transnational educational partnerships can help reshape Pakistan’s skills education infrastructure.\nKorea’s longstanding expertise in smart manufacturing, automation, electronics, and renewable energy technologies may prove vital in preparing Pakistani youth for high-demand global sectors.\nMoreover, the introduction of Korean language proficiency programs tied to opportunities abroad represents an innovative approach to labor mobility and global employability.\nIf implemented systematically, it could significantly diversify Pakistan’s expatriate workforce, which currently relies heavily on the Middle East for employment.\nThis diversification could not only provide more opportunities for Pakistani workers but also strengthen Pakistan’s ties with other regions, contributing to the country’s global presence and influence.\nThe Korean delegation also expressed their readiness to establish six Korean language centers under the Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training.\nThis initiative holds the promise of enhancing the global employability of Pakistani students, opening up new avenues for their career growth and contributing to the diversification of Pakistan’s expatriate workforce.\nSince its inception, NSU has emerged as Pakistan’s first public sector skills university, offering both degree and skills programs in fields such as mechatronics, construction technology, and medical laboratory sciences. With the launch of the Muridke campus and increased engagement from international partners, NSU is positioning itself as a hub for future-ready education.\nThe university’s focus aligns with Pakistan Vision 2025, which emphasizes human capital development, innovation, and entrepreneurship.\nBy merging traditional education with hands-on training and global exposure, NSU is crafting a blueprint for other institutions across the country.\nThe Pro-Chancellor of the National Skills University Islamabad, Dr. Khalid Maqbool Siddiqui, in his concluding remarks, emphasized that the government sees skills education not merely as an academic endeavour but as a national economic strategy.\nHe assured continued ministry support for institutions like NSU, especially in expanding global pathways for Pakistani youth.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
