Remote regions will benefit from EdTech (Education Technology) solutions to ensure learning continuity, she added.\nIn line with the Prime Minister’s vision of universal access to education, she said Artificial Intelligence and other emerging technologies would be introduced from kindergarten through grade six. “The Prime Minister wants every child in Islamabad to receive education,” she stressed.\nThis smart education model, she said, would eventually be extended to Gilgit-Baltistan and other remote areas to provide quality digital learning even in the most isolated schools.\nOn the health front, the Ministry of IT is working with the Ministry of Health on a “One Patient, One ID” initiative to streamline healthcare records and services nationwide. Internet access is being ensured at BHUs to enable telemedicine, allowing patients to consult medical experts online.\nTo promote digital literacy, she said the Prime Minister has formed a special committee to integrate IT education into the national curriculum.\nHighlighting efforts in IT capacity-building, the minister said the government aims to train 500,000 youth in advanced digital skills. She noted that Google will train 200,000 students, Huawei 300,000, and Microsoft 200,000, preparing them to meet international job market standards.\n“Boys and girls will start learning AI from the primary level so that they can excel in the digital economy,” she added. “We are taking coordinated steps to build a globally competitive national IT workforce.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
