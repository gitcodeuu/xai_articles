  "content": "PESHAWAR, Jun 30 (APP): Sarhad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) has condemned the recent suicide bombing on convoy of security forces in Mirali area of North Waziristan, calling it as cowardice and wicked act.\nSCCI president Fazal Moqeem Khan, Senior Vice President Abdul Jalil Jan, Vice President Shehryar Khan and members of the Chamber’s Executive Committee in a joint statement issued here on Monday, described the attack on security forces as a heinous and cowardly act of terrorism and attempt to sabotage efforts for bringing peace and stability in motherland.\nThese acts are not just attacks on our soldiers, but an assault on our national sovereignty and economic future, say senior office bearers.\n“The goal is to undo the progress made in stabilizing post-conflict regions like the merged districts, and hinder the efforts for promotion commercial and trade activities”,\nThe SCCI stressed it as imperative to frame a comprehensive socio-economic uplift plan alongside the actions/operation of security forces to eliminate terrorists.\nThe senior office bearers put forward several proposals, mostly related to improvement and investment in basic infrastructure such as transport, energy and trade routes, special investment packages for tribal merged districts and overseas Pakistanis, creating employment avenues of youth, along with practical implementation on framework in collaboration with public-private sector to bear fruit of the peace and stability.\nThey emphasized on considering policy of closure of trade routes/borders during operations against terrorists and their sanctuaries elsewhere in the country, because business and trade of people especially living adjacent to border localities are attached with Afghanistan so it is of paramount importance to keep the wheel of business and industries spinning to produce employment avenues and boost trade and export as well, the SCCI said.\nThe Chamber’s senior office bearers paid rich tribute to armed forces, stating that our forces are not only guardians of the nation but they are also strategic partners in economic revival and prosperity in the whole region.\nSCCI called upon the government, international development organizations and civil society to play a proactive role in exposing Indian-state sponsored terrorism globally.",
