  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 30 (APP):Leading experts, diplomats, and policymakers unanimously urged on Monday to embrace a shift toward human-centered, integrated development for Balochistan under Phase-II of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to establish the latter as gateway to sustainable growth and development.\nThe Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) under its Monday Seminar Series organized a high-level policy seminar titled “Balochistan’s Gateway to Sustainable Development: Market Opportunities and Investment Pathways under CPEC” moderated by Engineer Ubaid-Ur-Rehman Zia, Head of SDPI’s Energy Unit, said a press release.\nOpening the session, Dr. Hassan Daud Butt, Senior Advisor, Energy China and former project director CPEC, emphasized that “Gwadar is not just a port, it’s Pakistan’s gateway to Eurasia.” Highlighting Balochistan’s untapped economic potential, he pointed out the province accounts for 44% of Pakistan’s landmass and 40% of the country’s livestock, while also possessing one of the largest wind energy corridors in South Asia. By 2050, Balochistan’s population is expected to grow to 24 million, further amplifying the urgency for sustainable development planning, he added.\nHe noted that Chinese and Kazakh investors have shown interest in Balochistan’s rail infrastructure, with Kazakhstan alone willing to invest $500 million. “Projects like ML-1 and the establishment of an oil city in Gwadar are long-term, but we need sustainable growth along the coast immediately,” said Dr. Hassan Butt, adding that Gwadar is strategically positioned to become a petrochemical and industrial base.\nAmbassador Jauhar Saleem, President of the Institute of Regional Studies, noted that Balochistan holds one of the largest reserves of critical earth minerals—making it pivotal to global supply chains. “Pakistan can become a $40 billion transit economy by 2035 if Gwadar is developed effectively,” he remarked, also calling attention to Balochistan’s agricultural strengths including high-value fruits and vast livestock reserves.\nHowever, he strongly criticized governance inefficiencies, corruption, and lack of basic amenities in Balochistan, urging a re-evaluation of CPEC to ensure it benefits local communities. “Without focusing on vocational training, technology transfer, and grassroots engagement, CPEC will fail to deliver,” he warned.\nAhad Nazir, Head of Policy at SDPI, stressed that without institutional reform, CPEC’s connectivity gains won’t translate into development. “Balochistan is mineral-rich but human-poor. Policy inconsistency, lack of coordination, and political interference are key barriers,” he said. He outlined five strategic levers including the establishment of an Investment Facilitation Unit and agro-business clusters.\nHe also cited international models, like Chile’s royalty reinvestment in mineral-rich regions, as pathways Balochistan could follow. Nazir also cautioned that public distrust, water scarcity, and security gaps pose risks to investor confidence.\nDr. Faiz Kakar, former provincial minister for Health, and Environment pointed out that despite ambitious plans, not a single motorway under CPEC runs through Balochistan. While Gwadar boasts a new international airport, major SEZs remain underdeveloped due to bureaucratic deadlock. “Chinese firms have proposed $2 billion investments, but demand a unified and streamlined one-window operation,” he said, stressing the need for urbanization and climate resilience planning.\nRenowned anthropologist Dr. Quratulain Bakhteari, Founder and Director, Institute for Development Studies and Practice (IDSP) raised a unique cultural lens to the debate, cautioning that reducing Balochistan to minerals and trade ignores its people. “Business and trade do not unite nations—people do. Development must be rooted in the community,” she urged.\nIn his closing remarks, Ambassador Saleem appreciated the “diverse, timely, and out-of-the-box” perspectives shared at the seminar. He underscored the importance of cultural understanding, community participation, and policy consistency to realize Balochistan’s role as a true gateway to regional development.\nHe concluded that Balochistan’s future under CPEC must go beyond infrastructure to invest in its people, environment, and institutional capacity.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
