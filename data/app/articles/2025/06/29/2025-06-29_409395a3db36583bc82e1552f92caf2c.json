  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 29 (APP): As heavy monsoon rains loom on the horizon, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has unveiled a sweeping contingency plan aimed at mitigating flash floods and safeguarding public life and infrastructure across Islamabad.\nThe emergency measures—effective from July 1 to September 30, 2025—focus on rapid disaster response, critical infrastructure preparedness, and public awareness, CDA spokesperson Nawazish Ali Asim told APP on Sunday.\nHe said a dedicated Flood Relief Cell under the CDA’s Directorate of Emergency & Disaster Management (E&DM) will serve as the central hub for all monsoon-related emergencies.\nResidents can report flood incidents, blocked drains, or request rescue through helplines: 16, 1122, 051-9252842-3 (for fire and rescue), and 1334, 051-9213908 (for sanitation issues).\n“Our priority is to minimize disruption and protect lives,” the CDA spokesperson said. “We urge citizens to cooperate with authorities and follow safety guidelines during heavy rainfall.”\nLed by Director E&DM Zafar Iqbal, with support from USAR Wing Head Muhammad Akram and Rescue Incharge Tariq Masood, specialized teams—including urban search and rescue personnel, sniffer dogs, and sanitation crews—have been mobilized for swift deployment in vulnerable zones.\nTo reduce the risk of urban flooding, Asim said all relevant CDA departments have been instructed to clear stormwater drains, nullahs, and road gullies of debris before rainfall begins.\nEfforts also include inspecting sunken graves in cemeteries to prevent collapse, removing wild vegetation and fallen trees obstructing water channels as well as monitoring high-risk katchi abadis (informal settlements) and relocating residents living near flood-prone nullahs.\nSimilarly, he said Capital Hospital and affiliated dispensaries will remain on high alert, with emergency medical teams ready to respond.\nDe-watering pumps, jet-suck machines, and heavy machinery like shovels and loaders have been pre-positioned at strategic flood-prone sites.\nThe Electricity and Maintenance Directorate will ensure backup power supplies and quick repairs to avoid prolonged outages, while coordination with IESCO and Sui Northern Gas aims to ensure utility safety and continuity.\nFurthermore, he noted that the CDA’s Public Relations Directorate will launch a multimedia public awareness campaign—via TV, radio, and newspapers—urging residents to avoid illegal drainage connections from basements, which exacerbate flooding.\nCitizens are also encouraged to monitor weather alerts from the Pakistan Meteorological Department and use official helplines to report emergencies or obstructions.\nThe CDA spokesperson stated that the authority will maintain close coordination with the ICT Administration, Islamabad Police, IESCO, Sui Northern Gas, and, if needed, the Pakistan Navy for high-risk rescue operations.\n“We’re taking a proactive, multi-agency approach this year,” said an official from the E&DM wing. “Every department has clear instructions and defined roles to ensure Islamabad stays safe.”\nEmergency Contact Information Rescue & Fire Services: 16 / 1122 / 051-9252842-3, Sanitation Complaints: 1334 / 051-9213908 Director E&DM: Zafar Iqbal – 0333-5123536, USAR Wing Head: Muhammad Akram – 0334-4091169, Rescue Incharge: Tariq Masood – 0331-5881117\nThe CDA has advised all residents to stay informed, take precautionary measures, and follow official updates during the upcoming monsoon season.",
