These facilities not only provide education and emotional support but also offer children the opportunity to reclaim their childhood in safe, nurturing environments.\nThe Orphan and Widow Support Program ensures monthly stipends to families of school-going orphans, while free cochlear implant surgeries help children with hearing impairments rediscover the world around them.\nTo uplift women economically and socially, PBM runs 165 Women Empowerment Centers across the country, providing skill-based vocational training aimed at enabling financial independence. In the health sector, PBM supports critical medical treatments for impoverished patients and offers rehabilitation initiatives for persons with disabilities.\nFor youth advancement, scholarships and sponsorships are provided to deserving students, helping bridge financial barriers to education and technical training. In addition to this, mobile food vans distribute hot meals to the destitute and homeless, while shelters offer safety and support to those in dire circumstances.\nThe MD emphasized that PBM is shifting its approach from short-term aid to long-term empowerment. He underscored the need to equip citizens with the tools of self-reliance, adding that the mission goes beyond service—it is about uplifting people with dignity, empathy, and fairness.\nMD of Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal (PBM), has voiced serious concern over the deepening socio-economic crisis in the country, citing nearly 40% of the population living below the poverty line and 26 million children out of school, with girls forming a disproportionate majority.\nHe also highlighted the plight of over 3 million children engaged in labor, calling it “a heartbreaking reflection of society’s failure to protect its most vulnerable.” PBM chief emphasized the need for urgent, inclusive measures to ensure no child is deprived of education or a safe childhood.\nHe concluded with a call to unity and collective responsibility, reaffirming that PBM’s compassionate model of governance must serve as a beacon for national solidarity.
