  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 29 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has raised a serious concern about the intensifying threat that extreme heat poses to ocean ecosystems, coastal urban environments and port-dependent communities.\nIn a statement on Sunday, the minister warned that the mounting heat is severely disrupting daily life in urban coastal areas, where dense populations, limited green spaces, and inadequate infrastructure amplify the impacts of extreme weather.\n“Our ports are the engines of national trade,” he said, “but the communities that support them cannot be left behind in our climate response. Building climate resilience starts by protecting the lives and livelihoods of those living in our coastal zones.”\nThe Minister announced the launch of the “Port Community Climate Resilience Program,” a pilot initiative to be rolled out in select neighborhoods of Karachi and Gwadar. This program will engage local communities in shaping localized, sustainable climate solutions and improving public awareness.\nHe highlighted the urgent need for coordinated responses to rising temperatures. Stressing collaboration with regional friendly countries, the minister called for joint scientific research on the impact of warming sea surface temperatures on marine biodiversity and human health.\nHe said that a comprehensive national action plan would also be developed in coordination with provincial authorities, port administrations, and climate experts to prepare a series of immediate interventions, including urban greening projects and ventilation retrofitting in informal settlements near ports to reduce urban heat accumulation and improve living conditions for vulnerable populations.\nThe federal minister also underscored the importance of improving labour safety standards at ports. He called for mandatory rest areas with shade and potable water, regulation of work hours during heatwaves, and enforcement of work stoppages during red-level heat alerts. “Port workers are at the frontline of our maritime economy. They must be protected from the worst effects of extreme heat,” he stated.\nHe linked long-term resilience to climate-conscious development strategies, pointing to the Karachi Master Plan 2047 as a critical opportunity to embed heat adaptation into infrastructure and city planning. This includes the construction of green corridors, reflective surfaces, and architecture designed to promote airflow.\nTo strengthen structural resilience, the minister advocated for investing in climate-smart infrastructure using heat-resistant materials and sustainable construction methods to withstand future heat extremes and reduce environmental strain.\nAcknowledging the economic vulnerabilities of port side communities, many of whom depend on outdoor work such as fishing, transport, and cargo handling, he stressed the importance of promoting alternative livelihoods. Diversifying income sources, he said, will reduce exposure to extreme weather and open up safer employment opportunities.\nCommunities living near ports are among the first to feel the effects of climate change. In areas like Karachi’s coastal belts and informal settlements near the fish harbour, residents face high exposure to heat without access to cooling, clean water, or medical services. The Minister noted an increase in cases of heatstroke, respiratory distress, and dehydration in these zones. In Gwadar, fishing operations and small businesses have suffered, while children and elderly residents remain at heightened risk due to a lack of emergency healthcare services.\nQuoting World Health Organization statistics, the Minister noted that nearly half a million people die annually due to heat-related causes—a figure expected to rise by 50 percent by 2050. “This is not only a public health issue,” he said. “It’s a growing development crisis that is already disrupting our urban economies, damaging labour productivity, and overloading public systems.”\nHe reiterated that climate change can no longer be viewed as a distant environmental concern, but rather as an immediate development challenge for maritime future. Rising heat is cutting into work hours, slowing port operations, and endangering the well-being of labourers who form the backbone of the national logistics network.\nFinally, he urged development partners and international donors to support Pakistan’s push toward protecting its coastal populations and ensuring the continuity of critical maritime functions in the face of escalating climate risks.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
