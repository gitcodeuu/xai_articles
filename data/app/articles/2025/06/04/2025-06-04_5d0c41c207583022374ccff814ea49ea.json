  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 04 (APP):Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) and Minister of State, Syed Tariq Fatemi, on Wednesday concluded a three-day official visit to the Russian Federation from June 2 to 4 amid a significant diplomatic engagement aimed at deepening bilateral cooperation.\nDuring his visit, Fatemi held a series of high-level meetings, including with the Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and, Minister of Energy and Co-Chair of the Pakistan-Russia Inter-Governmental Commission (IGC) Sergey Tsivilev.\nThe discussions covered a comprehensive range of bilateral issues, including trade, energy, connectivity, cyber security, and the prospect of a new steel mill project.\nHighlighting Pakistan’s growing energy needs, Fatemi underscored the importance of expanding energy cooperation with Russia. He also provided a detailed briefing on the recent developments in South Asia, commending Russia’s constructive role in promoting regional stability and de-escalating tensions.\nMinister Tsivilev expressed satisfaction with the outcomes of the ninth Pakistan-Russia IGC held in Moscow last year and conveyed optimism for a fruitful follow-up session set to take place in Pakistan later this year. He noted Pakistan’s emerging role as a regional “transit hub,” pointing to the country’s strategic connectivity potential.\nIn a separate engagement, Fatemi called on Yury Ushakov, Senior Aide to the Russian President on Foreign Policy. Their conversation focused on the regional security environment, with Fatemi elaborating on Pakistan’s position regarding India’s recent aggressive posture, particularly New Delhi’s unilateral suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty.\nBeyond official meetings, Fatemi appeared in interviews on major Russian television networks, where he offered insights into the strengthening ties between Islamabad and Moscow and voiced Pakistan’s concerns over India’s actions in the region.\nFatemi also engaged in substantive discussions with Russian academics and journalists, and delivered a keynote address at the Valdai Discussion Club, a premier Moscow-based think tank. His talk centered on South Asia’s evolving geopolitical landscape and Pakistan’s strategic partnership with Russia.\nThe visit was widely regarded as a diplomatic success, further cementing the foundations of a multifaceted partnership between the two countries. Observers noted the growing warmth in bilateral relations, particularly in areas such as energy collaboration, trade, investment, and regional connectivity.\nAs Pakistan seeks to recalibrate its foreign policy priorities, Fatemi’s engagements in Moscow are seen as a step toward reinforcing a strategic alignment with Russia in pursuit of mutual economic and geopolitical goals.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
