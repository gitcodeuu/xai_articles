Global media outlets quoted how ridiculous propaganda was aired by Indian media”, he said.\nOn the contrary Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Inter Services Public Relations and media houses of Pakistan did play their role in an effective but responsible manner,  he added.\nThe minister said that Maarka-e-Haq and Operation Bunyan Marsus would always be remembered as great triumph since Allah Almighty honoured Pakistan against its enemy.\nIn tense and critical situation, the Pakistani nation demonstrated exemplary solidarity and unity, Attaullah  Tarar said adding under the leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Pakistan Armed Forces acted in a coordinated manner and foiled Indian nefarious designs.\nAttaullah Tarar said after defeat on every forum, India was now spreading false propaganda in an effort of face-saving. He said now even in India, questions were being raised about PM Modi’s failed strategy.\nThe minister said that New Delhi was involved in acts of  terrorism in multiple countries including Pakistan as Indian state sponsored terrorism had reached Canada, America and Australia.\nReferring to proofs on Indian involvement in terrorist activities in Balochistan, he said Indian Navy serving commander Kulbhushan Jadhav was captured from Balochistan. He said India was funding terrorist acts in Balochistan but Pakistan was determined to eliminate all types of terrorism by defeating India proxies.\nThe minister said terrorism in other countries was part of India’s  foreign policy, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had admitted that India supported Mukti Bahini in 1971.\nHe said when Jafar Express train incident happened, Indians somehow celebrated hostage taking and Indian media had given special coverage to terrorists by showing their interviews live.\nHe said when Pahalgam incident happened, Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif offered an impartial, transparent international investigation, but India did not respond as it would have exposed the false flag operation.\nTarar expressed the determination that the Fitna-ul-Hindustan will be eliminated from Balochistan at all costs.\nDuring Attaullah Tarar’s press conference, video evidence of Indian terrorism was also shown to media.
