  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 04 (APP): Federal Minister for National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination, Mustafa Kamal has reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthen the domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing base.\nHe was chairing a meeting with a delegation of Pakistan Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PPMA) to discuss a range of pressing issues within the pharmaceutical sector.\nThe meeting also discussed other areas included amendments to drug regulations, indigenous production of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs), and efforts to expand pharmaceutical exports, especially in collaboration with Afghanistan.\nThe minister said, “We must work jointly to ensure local production of APIs, not only to reduce reliance on imports and save valuable foreign exchange reserves, but also to unlock the export potential of our pharmaceutical products.”\nHe instructed the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) to prepare a detailed concept note on the establishment of a Naphtha Cracker facility.\nThis facility would produce vital raw materials needed for API manufacturing—marking a strategic step toward reducing Pakistan’s dependence on foreign chemical imports.\nTackling the issue of counterfeit drugs, the minister announced the introduction of a nationwide trace and track system.\nThe system will feature a unique barcode printed on each medicine package, enabling consumers to verify authenticity and retail pricing through their mobile phones.\nThe meeting concluded on a positive note, with both parties agreeing to enhance public-private partnerships, streamline regulatory frameworks, and implement strategic measures to ensure medicine quality and boost pharmaceutical exports.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
