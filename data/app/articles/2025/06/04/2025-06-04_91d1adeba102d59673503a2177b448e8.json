  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 4 (APP): Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Wednesday said that while military-to-military understanding between India and Pakistan remains intact and the ceasefire is holding, political rhetoric from the Indian leadership continues to stir tensions, potentially due to domestic considerations, including upcoming elections in Bihar.\n“Another round of conflict seems remote, but we must remain vigilant,” the deputy prime minister said while speaking at a press conference here.\nHe emphasized that the “timeline goalposts” agreed upon between the two sides had been implemented that showed the sincerity of the purpose or seriousness. However, he warned that “political rhetoric was still on,” and could have internal reasons, pointing to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s and Defence Minister’s recent statements, including one referring to recent hostilities as “just a trailer.”\n“I wish sense prevails. we have told the world that we are peace lovers and focused on economic revival,” the deputy PM stressed. But he said, “Dignity, sovereignty, and territorial integrity come first — and any conflict can escalate unpredictably.”\nDPM Dar reiterated that Pakistan was open to dialogue — especially on counter-terrorism, but criticized India’s rigid stance, particularly Indian Foreign Minister Jaishankar’s claim that India would only engage in discussions centered on terrorism. “We have already exposed Indian agencies’ involvement in our territory,” Dar said, adding that the independent movements within its borders were not under the Pakistan’s control.\nHe also highlighted his recent diplomatic engagements, particularly the informal bilateral visit to China on May 19, which included discussions around a trilateral meeting involving Afghanistan.\nHe also noted a broader regional outreach, citing engagements with Turkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan. “Our visit to Iran was especially positive,” Dar said, adding that both countries agreed to boost bilateral trade to $10 billion and maintain peace in the region. The Pakistani delegation also met with Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who expressed support for Pakistan’s regional stability and Kashmir resolution efforts.\nDar revealed that Azerbaijan had reiterated its stance on undertaking a $2 billion investment in Pakistan, while discussions on multilateral cooperation, territorial integrity, and regional connectivity projects, including the Trans-Afghan railway and Peshawar-Kabul highway, are progressing.\nTo a question, the deputy PM criticized India’s stance on the Indus Waters Treaty, calling New Delhi’s push to renegotiate the agreement a violation of international law.\nHe said Pakistan and India were corresponding for last three years, that this treaty needed review and re-negotiation. “We received the last letter from India on April 8, and the reply was due on May 8 which we gave on time despite escalation of tension between the two countries.”\nThe treaty cannot be unilaterally suspended, he said adding that any such act would be treated as an act of war.\nTo another question, he said Saudi Arabia and the UAE played “active roles” in de-escalating recent tensions.\nDar emphasized that Pakistan’s diplomatic efforts had been recognized internationally. “From April 23 to May 11, we explained our position to the world. Our narrative prevailed. Indian claims, including about shooting down of F-16, were exposed.”\nHe confirmed that Pakistan would assume the presidency of the UN Security Council in July, with “promoting international peace and security through multilateralism and peaceful settlement of disputes” as its central theme.\nThe deputy PM stated that Pakistan had no intention of initiating conflict but would respond robustly if provoked. “We never initiated war, but we gave a befitting response,” he said. He also confirmed the downing of six Indian aircraft during recent hostilities, including three to four Rafale, one SU-30, and a UAV.",
