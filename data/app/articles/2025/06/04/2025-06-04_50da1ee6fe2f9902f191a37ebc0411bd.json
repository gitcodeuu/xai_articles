  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 04 (APP): As  intercity travel increases and a huge rush of travellers was seen ahead of Eid, complaints are surfacing against transporters charging more than the fixed fares at some bus terminals while some passengers claimed they were being asked to pay extra in the name of “Eidi.”\nMany passengers who were heading to Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and other parts of the country expressed concern about fare hikes. A few said that despite the presence of officials, some transporters still attempted to overcharge, especially during evening hours.\nWhen contacted the Islamabad district administration, its spokesman said that the authority has taken notice of the issue and launched monitoring operations at all major bus stands. According to officials, several teams led by Assistant Commissioners are visiting terminals, including Faizabad and 26 Number stop, to prevent overcharging.\nIn this regard, Deputy Commissioner Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon has directed that all Assistant Commissioners and magistrates remain on duty at bus stands throughout the Eid rush. He stated that any transporter caught demanding more than the approved fare will face immediate action.\nHe also urged citizens not to pay even one rupee above the official fare. “If any driver or operator asks for extra money, report it on the spot,” he said. He added that passengers should cooperate with the administration to stop illegal practices.\nThe administration’s move is aimed at ensuring smooth travel and protecting passengers from fare manipulation during the busy holiday period, the spokesman added.\nDC Irfan Memon also emphasized the need to ensure that the passengers treated with respect. “Providing a fair and decent journey to all travelers is our responsibility,” he said.\nOperations at the terminals include random checks, inquiries from passengers about fares, and verification of fare charts displayed at ticket counters. In several instances, transporters were warned or fined for failing to follow the rules.\nThe Deputy Commissioner has appealed to the public to report any violations directly to the Assistant Commissioners present at the terminals. He said such complaints are being addressed immediately, with transporters either being penalized or barred from continuing their services.\nThe administration has also set up helpline numbers and complaint desks at major terminals to facilitate passengers. Special squads have been formed to monitor transport activities during peak hours.\nThe administration has also warned transport companies and terminal managers that strict action will be taken if any violations are reported. Fines and permit suspensions are among the measures being considered against those who break the rules.\nMeanwhile, travelers are being reminded to verify fares before buying tickets and to immediately report any irregularities.\nBy increasing field presence and encouraging public cooperation, Islamabad’s district administration aims to keep transport fair and accessible for everyone this Eid.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
