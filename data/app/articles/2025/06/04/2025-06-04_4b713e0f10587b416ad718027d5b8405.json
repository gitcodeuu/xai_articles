She stressed the importance of integrated, evidence-based approaches to managing Pakistan’s water crisis, especially in the face of upstream interventions and climate change.\nEnvironmental legal expert, Rafay Alam delved into the legal dimensions of the IWT, underlining Pakistan’s rights under international law and its potential recourse through the International Court of Justice.\nAddressing the broader geopolitical implications, Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed called the suspension a blow to regional diplomacy, warning it could damage India’s global reputation and further strain its relations with China.\nHe termed the weaponization of water as a crime against humanity.\nClimate expert, Ali Tauqeer Sheikh discussed the compounded risks of climate change in the wake of the treaty’s suspension and called for a national water strategy to address Pakistan’s growing vulnerability.\nRenowned defence analyst, Ikram Sehgal linked India’s aggressive posture to a broader pattern of hostility, warning that water could become the new battleground if diplomatic solutions fail.\nIn his concluding remarks, Dr. Iqbal Choudhary, Coordinator General, OIC-COMSTECH, summarized the seminar’s deliberations and emphasized the need for Pakistan to pursue all available diplomatic, legal, and multilateral channels to safeguard its water interests.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
