The current global retreat from justice demands collective action from religious, legal and political leaders to restore trust in fair governance and human rights.”\nChief Justice of Pakistan echoed these sentiments, reaffirming Pakistan’s dedication to judicial integrity and the application of Islamic legal principles in contemporary contexts.\nHe said, “The teachings of Islam provide a timeless framework for justice, and it is our duty as jurists to ensure these principles are upheld amidst modern complexities. Collaboration between scholars and judicial institutions is essential to address systemic injustices.”\nHaving remained associated with the Saudi justice system in various capacities, Pakistan is eager to learn from the expertise of Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Alissa in the domain of orphans and widows’ rights, inheritance rights and contractual obligations, he said.\nThe meeting also explored avenues for enhanced cooperation between the Muslim World League and the Supreme Court of Pakistan to advance educational and legal initiatives promoting justice and ethical governance. Both leaders agreed on the necessity of fostering dialogue among Muslim nations to strengthen judicial systems in line with Islamic values.\nOn the invitation of the Chief Justice of Pakistan, Sheikh Dr. Mohammed Alissa agreed to visit Pakistan for institutional engagement with the Judiciary of Pakistan to generate intellectual dialogue, particularly on Islamophobia and interfaith. They remained very cordial and would open up new avenues of dialogue and cooperation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
