For which we are deeply grateful to our Pakistani brothers and sisters living abroad, the current account has improved, he added.\nThe minister said that our government would provide more facilities to Pakistanis abroad so that they continue to play an active role in the country’s development.\nIn light of the orders of the Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, several steps were being taken for Pakistanis living abroad, such as the establishment of special courts in peace, he said.\nThe minister said that an online system would be introduced for registering cases and collecting evidence, and relevant civil procedures would be mandatory changed to prevent false cases.\nThe federal government is setting a quota for children of overseas Pakistanis in chartered universities and medical colleges, and scholarships will be provided for skill training, he said.
