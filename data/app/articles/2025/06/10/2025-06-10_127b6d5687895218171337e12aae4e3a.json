It promotes peaceful coexistence based on mutual respect and paves the way for joint solutions to the great challenges of our time.”\nHe urged to facilitate exchanges among civilizations, advocating for gaining insight through conversations between civilizations to tackle global issues and expand the options for global development.\nHe said that the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI)- a diplomatic initiative of China complements the Global Security Initiative (GSI) and the Global Development Initiative (GDI) and serves to establish a multipolar world order and to seek progress for humanity and harmony for the entire world.\nHe said that China and Pakistan have agreed to take the lead in implementing the GCI by enhancing civilizational exchanges and amity between their peoples. He added that China and Pakistan have also agreed to make joint efforts regarding GSI.\nOther speakers at the event focused on the urgent theme, “The Imperative of Dialogue among Civilizations in a Changing World.” They warned that as the world faces interconnected crises—ranging from conflict and inequality to mistrust and environmental degradation—dialogue remains the most effective tool to bridge divides and build peace.\nThey described dialogue to eliminate prejudice, foster mutual understanding, and strengthen global cooperation.\nThe International Day for Dialogue among Civilizations, they added, serves as a reminder of the importance of cultural diversity, inclusivity, and shared humanity in an increasingly polarized world.\n“The world is celebrating the contribution of Chinese civilization to what the world is today, and we are also celebrating the diversity of humanity, and out of this diversity we make a beautiful tapestry and a beautiful mosaic of the world,” speakers said.\nSpeakers praised China for proposing the initiative, saying that dialogue among civilizations can help solve global challenges such as climate change, poverty, pandemics, conflicts and migration.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
