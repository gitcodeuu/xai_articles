In this regard, he said a significant reduction in income tax rates is proposed for salaried people in all income slabs.\nThis relief will not only simplify the tax structure but will also ensure a balance between inflation and take-home salary by reducing the tax burden on the middle-income earners.\nThe tax rate for those earning between Rs. 600,000 and Rs. 1.2 million has been reduced from 5% to just 1%. Furthermore, it is also proposed to reduce the tax amount for salaried people earning between Rs. 1.2 million and\nRs 2.2 million from Rs. 30,000 to Rs. 6,000 and the minimum tax rate is also proposed to be reduced to 11% from 15%.\nSimilarly, a reduction in tax rate is being proposed for those earning higher salaries. The tax rate for those earning between Rs. 2.2 million and Rs. 3.2 million is proposed to be reduced from 25% to 23%. This move reflects the government’s commitment to making taxes fairer and reducing the burden on salaried individuals, the finance minister said.\nIn order to stop brain drain from the country, he said that the government has proposed to remove one percent surcharge on the people having income of more than 10 million.\nHe said the super tax rate on the corporations earning annual income between Rs 200 million to 500 million is being reduced by 0.5%.\nIn the construction sector, the government has also proposed to reduce the rate of Withholding Tax on the purchase of property from 4% to 2.5%, from 3.5% to 2%, and from 3% to 1.5%.\nLikewise, the finance minister also announced to eliminate the federal excise duty of up to 7% imposed last year on the transfer of commercial properties, plots, and houses.\nFurthermore, he said tax credit is being introduced for houses up to 10 marla and flats of up to 2000 sqft to provide loans for the construction of low-cost houses and to encourage mortgage.\nThe government has also proposed to reduce the stamp paper duty on the purchase of property in Islamabad from 4% to 1%. He hoped that the provinces will also support the federal government’s move by slashing heavy taxes imposed on the immovable property.\nHe said the tax rate on the interest income has been proposed to increase from current 15% to 20%.

He made it clear that the government has no intention to impose tax on the low and middle income pensioners.\nIn order to promote cashless economy, the government has proposed to increase the advance tax rate on withdrawing cash for the non-filers from current 0.6% to 1%.\n“We are making necessary reforms to remove loopholes, improve equity and make tax laws easier to comply with,” the finance minister said adding that rental income from commercial properties will now be recognized at a standard rate of 4% of the fair market value. This will limit the discretionary powers of the tax authorities.\nThe finance minister said the government was going to propose steps to improve enforcement, reduce tax theft and promote transparency in the tax system.\nHe said that in order to encourage local manufacturing of solar panels, the government has proposed to impose 18% sales tax on the import of solar panels.\nSimilarly, the finance minister said the government has decided to remove the tax exemption for the newly merged districts of KP and Balochistan.
