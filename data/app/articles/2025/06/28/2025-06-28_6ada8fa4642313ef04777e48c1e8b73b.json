But today, they are at the heart of one of the city’s most severe public health challenges.\n“We’re not just cutting trees – we’re protecting lives,” said CDA Environment Director Irfan Niazi “This operation is one of the most critical environmental health initiatives in the city’s history, ” he told APP.\nThe urgency is rooted in the tree’s pollination cycle. Each spring, male paper mulberry trees release vast amounts of light, windborne pollen that causes severe allergic reactions in tens of thousands of Islamabad residents.\nIn peak season – typically March to early April – hospitals across the city report an alarming rise in asthma attacks and allergy-related complications.\nAccording to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), more than 12,000 allergy patients are treated each year due to mulberry pollen.\nEmergency rooms see a 30% rise in asthma admissions. Children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing respiratory issues are most at risk.\n“Timing is everything,” said CDA’s horticulture official Akhtar Rasool. “If we don’t remove a critical mass of these trees before the next flowering cycle, we’ll see another health disaster next year.”\nThe CDA’s tree removal campaign – which began last year – has now entered an accelerated phase.\nTeams have been deployed across Islamabad’s most affected sectors, including G-6, G-7, F-6, and F-8, where mulberry trees are most densely planted.The process is anything but random.\n“We’ve mapped tree locations with GPS tagging,” explained Rasool. “Each tree is assessed for age, size, and proximity to sensitive locations like schools and hospitals. Only male trees are targeted, and all operations are recorded for transparency.”\nChainsaws buzz daily through the capital’s residential sectors as workers, clad in neon safety vests and dust masks, cut down the trees, chip the trunks, and haul away the remains.\nSpecialized traffic management and safety teams coordinate efforts to ensure public mobility and protection of infrastructure.\nPerhaps the most ambitious part of the campaign is the post-removal replantation plan.\nFor every paper mulberry removed, the CDA is planting at least 10 native trees in its place. These include species like phulai (Acacia modesta), amaltas (Cassia fistula), sukh chain (Dalbergia sissoo), and wild olive (Olea ferruginea), all chosen for their shade, biodiversity support, and most importantly, low allergenic potential.\n“These trees don’t release airborne pollen the way mulberries do,” said CDA botanist Rana Kashif. “They’re heavy-pollinated or insect-pollinated, which means their reproduction doesn’t harm human health.”\nTalking to APP, he said to support the initiative, CDA’s nurseries have ramped up production. Over 100,000 saplings are being cultivated this year alone, with planting scheduled during the ongoing monsoon season.\nAt Polyclinic Hospital, the atmosphere is cautiously optimistic. Dr. Swaira, a medical officer has been advocating for mulberry removal for over a decade.\nIn an exclusive chat with APP, she said “For years, we’ve watched this crisis escalate. In some cases, patients develop chronic asthma after repeated pollen exposure,” she said. “Now that action is finally being taken, we hope to see a measurable decline in allergy cases by 2026.”\nPIMS and Polyclinic hospilitals has added dedicated allergy clinics, enhanced emergency room capacity during peak pollen months, and is collaborating with CDA to monitor health outcomes as tree removals progress.\nYet, not everyone is convinced. An urban planner and landscape architect warns of ecological side effects. “A sudden removal of any dominant species can cause ripple effects – affecting birds, insects, even underground water absorption patterns,” he said. “Urban reforestation needs balance.”\nSome residents, too, have raised concerns about heat exposure. “We appreciate the health concerns,” said F-7 resident Salma Rehman, “but when they cut down these massive shade trees, our homes become unbearably hot.”\nTo address such worries, the CDA says new saplings are being planted strategically to ensure they mature near walkways, buildings, and schools, and are supplemented by fast-growing, non-invasive canopy species.\nA large part of CDA’s strategy now hinges on public cooperation. The authority has launched city-wide awareness campaigns, using FM radio, pamphlets, billboards, and social media to educate citizens.\n“We’re urging residents to support replanting efforts and avoid planting new paper mulberry trees, especially male ones,” said CDA spokesperson Nawazish Ali. “We’re also encouraging private property owners to allow native trees on their premises and report any illegal mulberry planting.”\nIn addition, Nawazish told APP that CDA has partnered with local schools and universities to involve youth in tree planting drives and monitor biodiversity restoration.\nOn removal of paper mulberry trees, the CDA spokesperson clarifies that it is one of authority’s top environmental health priorities.”\n“We are executing a two-phase removal plan, starting with the uprooting of both large and small trees from high-impact sectors such as F-8, G-8, and along Srinagar Highway.\nEach removed tree will be replaced with ten native, non-allergenic saplings—totaling over 57,000 new trees—to ensure greener, healthier, and more breathable neighborhoods. We urge citizens to report any unauthorized tree cutting and to support this transition towards a more sustainable Islamabad.”\nWhile the complete eradication of paper mulberry may take several years, early indicators are promising.\nAir quality monitors installed in test sectors have shown a modest reduction in particulate allergens this spring.\nCDA plans to release quarterly updates on allergy case trends, temperature fluctuations in tree-removed zones, and biodiversity recovery.\n“We are creating a new, safer, more sustainable Islamabad,” said CDA’s Environment Director.\n“Yes, there will be discomfort in the short term. But in the long run, this is an investment in our city’s future health and resilience.”\nAs Islamabad prepares for yet another spring in 2026, the hope is that with fewer mulberries in bloom, more of its citizens will breathe freely – without fear, medication, or emergency room visits.\nIn this race between health and horticulture, the chainsaws may just be carving out a path toward cleaner air.",
