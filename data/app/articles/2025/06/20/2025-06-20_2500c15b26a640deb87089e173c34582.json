  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 20 (APP): The Supreme Court’s Constitutional bench on Friday adjourned the hearing of review petitions against the verdict on reserved seats until June 23. The eleven-member bench, headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan, heard the case.\nRepresenting Kanwal Shauzab, senior lawyer Salman Akram Raja argued that Article 184(3) of the Constitution empowers the Supreme Court to act in the public interest and for the protection of fundamental rights, particularly in exceptional circumstances. Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail concurred, stating that the Supreme Court must act if there is a constitutional violation even in the absence of a specific article.\nHowever, Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar noted that Article 199 cannot be read in conjunction with Article 187, as the Supreme Court does not possess the same jurisdiction as the High Courts under Article 199. Raja responded that the Supreme Court has broad constitutional powers which can be exercised wherever necessary.\nJustice Mandokhail inquired whether the original verdict on reserved seats involved any constitutional or legal violation.\nRaja replied in the negative but explained that independent candidates were allowed to join political parties within 15 days instead of three, as no alternative was available under existing law.\nDuring the hearing, Justice Mandokhail pointed out that reserved seats relate to both minorities and the general public, to which Raja affirmed, adding that the general electorate’s role is equally important.\nJustice Najafi asked whether securing reserved seats is a fundamental right of political parties. Raja asserted that the public, through their votes, essentially endorse reserved seats as well, making it a fundamental right of parties, albeit one regulated by law.\nThe court then adjourned the hearing until June 23.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
