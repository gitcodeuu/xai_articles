Salik Hussain emphasized the importance of expanding safe, orderly, and regular avenues for migration, highlighting Pakistan’s commitment to ensuring the dignity, development, and well-being of its people.\n“Today’s thematic focus on legal pathways for migration, a topic of high relevance and priority for our government, is both timely and relevant,” he stated. “As global mobility increases and the demand for labour across various sectors rises, it becomes ever more important to expand safe, orderly, and regular avenues for migration.”\nThe Minister expressed his appreciation for the partnership with the Budapest Process, which brings together countries of origin, transit, and destination in a spirit of shared responsibility. “Pakistan has remained a steadfast partner of the Budapest Process for over two decades, and we value this unique platform,” Minister Ch. Salik Hussain said. “I would like to commend the Budapest Process Secretariat and the International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD) for their continued commitment to building consensus on migration governance through constructive dialogue and cooperation.”\nMinister Ch. Salik Hussain highlighted the significance of labor mobility for Pakistan’s economy and the well-being of its people. “Over 11 million Pakistanis abroad contribute not only to their host economies but also to our national growth through remittances and knowledge exchange,” he stated. “Our overseas Pakistanis continue to be a vital pillar of national resilience, and we are committed to ensuring that their migration journeys are safe, well-governed, and mutually beneficial.”\nThe Minister reaffirmed the government’s commitment to strengthening cooperation with destination countries and partners. “To this end, Pakistan has developed a robust legal migration framework that facilitates the deployment of our workforce abroad through structured, transparent, and rights-based processes,” Minister Ch. Salik Hussain said. “When managed well, migration benefits all parties, promoting development, economic growth, and shared opportunity.”\nMinister Ch. Salik Hussain also highlighted the importance of the Ministerial Declaration and Call for Action. “The recently adopted Ministerial Declaration and Call for Action, endorsed at the 7th Ministerial Conference in Budapest in November 2024, provides a renewed strategic framework for regional cooperation,” he stated. “Its strong focus on strengthening legal migration and mobility pathways aligns closely with Pakistan’s priorities.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
