  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 20 (APP): A national event titled She Nourishes Change marked the conclusion of a groundbreaking initiative that empowered thousands of rural women to lead the way in transforming agriculture, nutrition, and food security in Pakistan.\nThe event brought together policymakers, researchers, civil society, and community leaders to honor the achievements of women who played a central role in redefining rural resilience.\nCARE Pakistan, with support from PepsiCo Pakistan and in partnership with the PepsiCo Foundation’s long-term commitment to driving social impact, marked the successful conclusion of its flagship She Feeds the World (SFtW) program with a national event titled She Nourishes Change.\nLaunched in 2023, SFtW was designed to address some of the most pressing challenges in rural Pakistan—including climate stress, food insecurity, limited access to clean water, and the persistent exclusion of women from agricultural systems. What emerged from the fields of Vehari and Okara over two years was not just progress, but transformation.\nThe program directly supported over 130,000 people, while indirectly reaching an additional 1.5 million individuals.\nWomen-led Village Savings and Loan Associations mobilized over PKR 8.9 million, enabling the launch of micro-businesses and strengthening financial independence.\nThe adoption of climate-smart farming practices led to impressive yield increases—maize harvests rose from 63.5 to 74.7 maunds per acre, and potato yields improved from 60.1 to 69.4 maunds per acre. Access to clean water was significantly enhanced through the installation of ten water filtration plants, which now serve 32,717 people—many of whom gained access to safe drinking water for the first time.o\nAdditionally, 2,700 kitchen gardens were cultivated, empowering women to provide healthier meals for their families while reducing household expenses.Welcoming guests and dignitaries, Adil Sheraz, Country Director, CARE Pakistan, stated:“This program reminded us that real transformation doesn’t come from outside—it grows from within. She Feeds the World showed what’s possible when women lead with knowledge, confidence, and community support. We’re not just celebrating results—we’re witnessing the beginning of a movement led by women who are shaping the future of agriculture and dignity in Pakistan.”\nDelivering the keynote address, Hatim Khan, Senior Director, International Programs at the PepsiCo Foundation, shared:\n“What we’ve seen through She Feeds the World is not just improved farming – it’s a lasting impact that will continue to help transform the food system in communities across Pakistan. At the PepsiCo Foundation, we’re focused on building more inclusive and resilient farming communities and know that when women are trusted with resources, respected for their knowledge, and supported to lead, they don’t just grow crops – they can help build a stronger food future.”\nThe She Nourishes Change event featured powerful community stories—like that of Nageena, a poultry entrepreneur and savings group mentor.\nThe event featured a high-level panel discussion on inclusive agricultural value chains and policy pathways for scaling gender-responsive food systems in Pakistan, with distinguished panelists including Haseeb Malik, Senior Director Supply Chain – Foods, PepsiCo Pakistan, who shared insights on PepsiCo’s vision and dedication to advancing a more inclusive and sustainable agricultural future for Pakistan.\nThe knowledge, skills, and confidence imparted to program participants are poised to create impact not just today, but for generations to come. With proven results and strong community ownership, the model can be adopted at scale—across provinces, sectors, and systems.\nCARE Pakistan calls on donors, government institutions, and private sector leaders to invest in what works: women-led, community-rooted solutions that build resilient food systems and brighter futures.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
