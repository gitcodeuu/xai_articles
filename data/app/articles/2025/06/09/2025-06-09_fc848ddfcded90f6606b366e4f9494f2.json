In 2021, PTA introduced the Mobile Device Manufacturing (MDM) Regulations, which helped set up local manufacturing units.\nAs a result, 36 companies—both local and international, including joint ventures—have been granted 10-year MDM licenses to manufacture devices in Pakistan, strengthening the country’s position in the global mobile industry.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
