  "content": "He said, the government successfully completed the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Standby Arrangement (SBA) program with a focus on fiscal consolidation, gradual withdrawal of import restrictions, market-determined exchange rates, energy, SOEs, and governance reforms.\nAdministrative actions and central bank interventions helped narrow the gap between interbank and open market exchange rates, while incentives under the Pakistan Remittance Initiative (PRI) boosted formal remittance inflows.\nIn the agriculture sector, access to credit, fertilizer, machinery, and certified seeds was improved to enhance productivity. Investment inflows were encouraged through the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), particularly in sectors like energy, IT, agriculture, and mining, as part of a broader growth strategy.\nThe policy rate was reduced from 22% to 11% as inflation eased. The KSE-100 index surged by over 52%, investor sentiment improved, and Pakistan’s credit ratings were upgraded by both Fitch and Moody’s.\nEnergy diversification efforts continued, with the total installed power capacity reaching 46,604 MW. Overall, macroeconomic stability, enhanced investor confidence, and improved fiscal and external fundamentals signal a positive trajectory for the economy in FY2025.\nInvestments in education are ongoing, with Rs 61.12 billion allocated to HEC in FY2025 and literacy initiatives underway. Pakistan’s literacy rate stands at 60.65%, with urban literacy at 74.09% and rural at 51.56%.\nThe minister termed IT and telecom sectors are key drivers of digital growth and economic resilience. In July–March FY2025, ICT exports rose by 23.7% to $2.8 billion, with a trade surplus of $2.43 billion and $400 million contributed by freelancers.\nHe said, Global GDP growth was projected to slow to 2.8% in 2025 before improving to 3.0% in 2026, while inflation is expected to decline from 5.7% in 2024 to 4.3% in 2025 and 3.6% in 2026—offering relief for domestic price pressures.",
