  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 09 (APP): Renowned corporate strategist Imran Ghaznavi has released a landmark book, Reputation Management and Crisis Communication: A Study of Corporate Sector, offering a vital guide for business leaders navigating reputational challenges in an increasingly complex corporate world.\nNow available internationally, the book presents a comprehensive roadmap for managing corporate reputation—an intangible asset the World Economic Forum estimates contributes up to 65% of a company’s market value.\nWith over 30 years of experience advising multinational firms through major disruptions like the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, Ghaznavi emphasises that “reputation is not just an image; it’s hard-earned capital that can disappear within minutes.”\nThe publication introduces a structured, three-phase model for crisis management, focusing on pre-crisis planning, real-time response, and post-crisis recovery. It also argues for embedding reputation risk into corporate governance, suggesting that 30% of executive compensation be tied to reputation performance.\nKey features of the book include in-depth analysis of high-profile corporate crises, such as the Volkswagen emissions scandal and Apple’s supply chain issues, strategies for managing online backlash, disinformation, and the rising challenge of deepfakes and ready-to-use templates for crisis communication, media engagement, and reputation audits.\nThe book, which is targeted at CEOs, board members, public relations experts, risk professionals, students, and policymakers, is being lauded as a must-read for modern leadership.\nIndustry analysts say Ghaznavi’s work bridges a critical gap in business literature by blending academic research with real-world applications, setting a new benchmark for corporate crisis leadership in the digital era.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
