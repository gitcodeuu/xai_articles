Current expenditure increased by 18.3 percent to Rs 14,588.2 billion in July-March FY2025 (Rs 12,333.3 billion last year).\nThe Federal PSDP expenditure increased by 28.6 percent to Rs 413.6 billion (Rs 321.6 billion last year).\nOn the other hand, total revenues rose 36.7 percent to Rs 13,367.0 billion during July– March FY2025 (Rs 9,780.4 billion last year). Non-tax revenues surged 68.0 percent to Rs 4,229.7 billion (Rs 2,517.9 billion last year).\nTotal tax collection grew by 25.8 percent to Rs 9,137.3 billion during July–March FY2025 (Rs 7,262.5 billion last year). Both federal and provincial tax revenues improved significantly, supported by tax enhancing measures introduced under the Finance Act 2024.\nFBR net provisional tax collection rose 25.9 percent to Rs 10,233.9 billion during July–May FY2025 (Rs 8,125.7 billion last year). During July–March FY2025, provinces collectively recorded a surplus of Rs 1,053.3 billion, significantly higher than Rs 435.4 billion in the previous year.\nFiscal performance remains encouraging, driven by ambitious reforms coordinated with provinces, vital for long-term sustainability and inclusive growth, it says.\nAccording to the report, the global fiscal situation worsened in 2024, due to the lingering effects of high subsidies, social benefits, other current spending from the COVID-19 pandemic, and higher interest payments.\nConsequently, the global fiscal deficit increased by 0.1 percentage points to an average of 5.0 percent of GDP in 2024, while the global public debt increased by 1 percentage point to 92.3 percent of GDP in the same period.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
