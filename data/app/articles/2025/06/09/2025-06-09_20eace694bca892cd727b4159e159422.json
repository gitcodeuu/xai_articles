It includes biometric checks through NADRA’s e-Sahulat centers, easy online payments, and instant fee confirmations, making the process faster, safer, and fully digital.\nThese efforts improve Pakistan’s cybersecurity and build a strong telecom system, helping the country move towards a successful digital economy.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
