  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 09 (APP):Pakistan experienced its seventh wettest year since 1961 in 2024, with national rainfall surging 31% above the long-term average, according to the Economic Survey 2024-25 report.\nThe country received 390.0 mm of rain—well above the 297.6 mm average—but the yearly total masked dramatic monthly fluctuations, from record-breaking downpours to severe droughts.\nThe year began with an alarming 72% rainfall deficit in January, followed by a sharp recovery in February and March.\nApril shattered records as the wettest in over six decades, with 164% more rain than usual. However, May saw a drastic reversal, becoming the second-driest May on record.\nThe monsoon season brought mixed results: August was the second-wettest in 64 years, with rainfall 147% above average, while September saw a 30% drop. The year ended with an exceptionally dry December, ranking as the 10th driest since 1961.\nExperts highlight increasing climate volatility, noting that the all-time annual rainfall record of 526.9 mm—set just two years earlier in 2022—remains unchallenged.\nThe report underscores Pakistan’s vulnerability to extreme weather patterns, urging better water management and disaster preparedness.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
