  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP):In a major boost to the international mobility and recognition of Pakistani engineers, the Pakistan Engineering Council (PEC) has secured a six-year extension in its full membership of the International Professional Engineers Agreement (IPEA), under the umbrella of the International Engineering Alliance (IEA).\nAccording to the PEC, the announcement was made during the IEAM 2025, held from in Mexico.\nPEC was represented at the meeting by Senior Vice Chairman, Engr. Dr Sarosh Lodhi.\nThe IPEA is a multilateral agreement that facilitates the cross-border recognition of experienced professional engineers among member economies.\nWith this extension, engineers registered with PEC as International Professional Engineers (IntPE-PAK) will continue to enjoy professional recognition in all IPEA member countries without the need for further assessment. This development marks Pakistan’s sustained compliance with global benchmarks in engineering standards, regulation, and practice.\nPakistan first attained full IPEA membership in June 2018 after a rigorous peer-review process by the IEA. Since then, PEC has implemented a robust system to award the IntPE title to qualified engineers, enhancing their credibility and employment prospects abroad.\nThe six-year renewal acknowledges PEC’s commitment to upholding international best practices in engineering education, professional development, and ethics.\nChairman PEC, Engr Waseem Nazir, termed the extension a landmark achievement for Pakistan’s engineering sector.\n“This renewal reaffirms the international community’s trust in PEC’s regulatory framework and the professional competence of our Engineers.\nIt opens greater opportunities for Pakistani Engineers to contribute towards global projects and strengthens Pakistan’s footprint in the international Engineering landscape,” he said.\nWith this renewed mandate, PEC aims to further simplify the registration process for IntPE applicants, expand outreach to engineering professionals, and promote international collaboration.\nThe extension not only enhances the global standing of Pakistani Engineers but also reflects Pakistan’s growing role in the global Engineering fraternity.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
