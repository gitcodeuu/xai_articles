  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has taken a new step in the ongoing appeals of PTI founder and his wife Bushra Bibi in the £190 million reference by appointing a special prosecutor to represent the bureau in the Islamabad High Court.\nIn a significant development in the £190 million reference case, the National Accountability Bureau has appointed Advocate Javed Arshad as a special prosecutor to represent the bureau in the Islamabad High Court.\nThe case involves appeals and suspension requests filed by the PTI founder and his wife Bushra Bibi, challenging their convictions. According to an official notification issued by Acting Prosecutor General Mohammad Akbar Tarar, the appointment of Javed Arshad has been approved by the NAB Chairman.\nJaved Arshad will represent NAB specifically in the appeals and applications seeking suspension of the sentences handed down in the reference. The decision is aimed at ensuring focused legal representation in the high-profile case that is currently under review in the Islamabad High Court.\nThe court is hearing the appeals against the conviction related to the £190 million settlement that was allegedly mishandled. The NAB has accused the PTI founder of misuse of authority during his time in office, linking the case to assets acquired through the UK’s National Crime Agency’s repatriated funds.\nWith the appointment of a special prosecutor, NAB appears to be strengthening its legal team as the proceedings continue in the High Court. The next hearing in the case is expected soon.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
