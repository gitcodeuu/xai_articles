  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday temporarily suspended the notification of Pakistan Sports Board (PSB) for lifetime ban and a penalty of Rs. 1 million on former President and secretary general of Pakistan Boxing Federation.\nThe Court has referred the matter to the Panel of Adjudicators constituted under Clause 23 of the Constitution of the PSB.\nJustice Arbab Muhammad Tahir heard the case filed by former President of the Pakistan Boxing Federation and former Secretary General, Lt. Col. (R) Muhammad Nasir Ijaz.\nIn a written order, the court said that since an effective appellate forum exists under the PSB Constitution, the filing of a writ petition before this Court at this stage is premature.\nThe Court accordingly converted the writ into a grievance petition and deemed it pending before the Panel of Adjudicators, directing that the matter be decided strictly in accordance with law after affording fair hearing to all parties.\nCounsel for the petitioners, Mr. Asad Javed Advocate and Mr. Syed Hassan Ali Raza Advocate, presented their arguments before the Court.\nOn behalf of the PSB, Legal Advisor Mr. Saif ur Rehman Rao contended that an adequate appellate mechanism is available under the PSB Constitution and that the petitioners should avail the remedy provided therein.\nThe PSB assured the Court that the decision of the Panel of Adjudicators—whether in favour of or against the Board—shall be fully honored and implemented. It was further submitted that no member of the initial inquiry committee shall be included in the adjudicating panel to ensure impartiality, and that the proceedings shall be conducted in a fair, transparent, and independent manner.\nThe controversy arose during a boxing tournament in Italy in February 2024, when PN boxer Mr. Zohaib Rasheed was alleged to have unlawfully entered the hotel room of UK-born Pakistani boxer Ms. Laura Akram, stolen cash and his own passport, and fled the scene. Following the incident, the PSB held the senior officials of the Pakistan Boxing Federation responsible and imposed disciplinary sanctions.\nThe Court, while refraining from expressing any opinion on the merits of the impugned orders, clarified that the operation of the impugned Notification dated 27 September 2024—regarding the lifetime ban and penalty—shall remain suspended until the final decision is rendered by the Panel of Adjudicators, in order to allow the panel to exercise its jurisdiction effectively.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
