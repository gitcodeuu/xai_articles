  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 8 (APP): Health experts have revealed that taking daily doses of Vitamin D can significantly help lower high cholesterol levels, reduce the risk of hypertension and diabetes, and improve insulin production in the body.\n\nAccording to a study published in an international medical journal, American and Chinese researchers reviewed 99 global studies involving around 18,000 participants.\n\nThe findings showed that regular Vitamin D intake offers multiple health benefits and can help prevent several chronic diseases.\n\nExperts noted that while daily Vitamin D consumption benefits all age groups, it is particularly effective for older adults, as the body’s natural Vitamin D levels decline with age.\n\nThey emphasized that individuals above 50 years of age could gain the most advantage from regular supplementation.\n\nThe study suggested that even a single daily capsule of Vitamin D could aid in controlling cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes.\n\nHowever, experts advised that natural Vitamin D sources — such as sunlight exposure and nutrient-rich foods — should be prioritized, and supplements may be used when necessary to maintain healthy levels.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
