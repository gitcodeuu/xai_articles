  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 08 (APP): Inspector General of Police (IGP) Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi reviewed the performance of Deputy Superintendents of Police (DSPs) across the district and heard 15 appeals of police officers during an orderly room held at the Central Police Office.\n\nAn official told APP on Saturday that IGP Rizvi also issued directives for the posting of officers who demonstrated excellent performance as Sub-Divisional Police Officers (SDPOs) in various circles, ensuring all transfers and postings were carried out purely on merit.\n\nThe IGP emphasized that SDPOs are directly responsible for maintaining law and order in their respective areas and must work closely with their subordinates to deliver the best possible services to citizens. He noted that the performance of supervisory officers directly affects the overall efficiency of the force; therefore, each officer must take a personal interest in crime prevention, timely investigation, and community engagement.\n\nHe said that all police officers should always consider public service their foremost mission and dedicate their efforts to improving institutional performance and public confidence in the police.\n\nLater, the IGP heard 15 appeals of police personnel during the orderly room — 14 were approved and one was rejected. He directed senior officers to complete all pending inquiries on priority and ensure early resolution of departmental matters.\n\nHe reaffirmed that the welfare of police officers and the protection of citizens’ lives and property remain top priorities of Islamabad Police.\n\n> “The doors of my office are always open for all officers,” he said. “The purpose of holding the orderly room is to address welfare concerns, motivate the force, and strengthen their morale.”\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
