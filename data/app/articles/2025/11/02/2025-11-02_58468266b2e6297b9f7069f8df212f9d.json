  "content": "LAHORE, Nov 01 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif has praised the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) for achieving a record 5.9 million tax return filings during the fiscal year 2025 and expressed gratitude to the nation for demonstrating a strong sense of responsibility.\n\nIn a statement issued on Friday, the Prime Minister said that the inclusion of 900,000 new tax filers in the tax net reflects the public’s growing trust in the government’s economic policies. “We are deeply thankful to the people of Pakistan for their confidence in the government’s reforms,” he added.\n\nShehbaz Sharif said that by the grace of Allah Almighty, the government’s efforts to reform the tax system have begun to yield positive results. He emphasized that meritocracy has been given top priority within the FBR, introducing a performance-driven culture that rewards competent and hardworking officers while discouraging poor performance.\n\nThe Prime Minister noted that he personally supervises the digitization of the FBR by chairing weekly meetings, adding that tax return filing has been made easier and more user-friendly.\n\nHe further stated that the introduction of an automated clearance system at ports has helped eliminate corruption and enhance efficiency, while the expansion of the Point of Sale (POS) network has reduced sales tax evasion and curbed the informal economy.\n\nHighlighting the success of the reforms, the Prime Minister said that a Rs 9 billion increase in tax revenue compared to the previous fiscal year stands as clear evidence of the effectiveness of the government’s FBR reforms.\n\n“The process of further reforms in the FBR system is continuing without interruption,” he concluded, reaffirming the government’s commitment to eradicating corruption and the informal economy.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
