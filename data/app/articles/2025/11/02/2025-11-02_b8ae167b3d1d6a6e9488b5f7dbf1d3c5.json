  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 02 (APP): Islamabad is once again set to dazzle with the colors, sounds and spirit of Pakistan’s cultural diversity as Lok Virsa transforms into a vibrant hub of creativity and celebration.\n\nUnder the clear autumn skies, the sprawling grounds bustle with artisans giving final touches to their stalls, musicians tuning their instruments, and the scent of traditional food filling the air-heralding the grand opening of Lok Mela 2025, the country’s most awaited folk festival.\n\nOrganized by the National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa) under the National Heritage and Culture Division, the ten-day festival will run from November 07-16, promising to turn the capital into a vibrant hub of Pakistan’s folk heritage.\n\nThis year’s theme, “Celebrate Pakistan’s Colors, Crafts, and Culture -all in one place,” captures the essence of the event-a joyful union of provinces, traditions, and communities.\n\nPavilions representing Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu and Kashmir are being set up with distinctive decorations that mirror each region’s identity. Artisans are arranging displays of embroidered textiles, mirror work, pottery, and handmade jewelry.\n\nIn another corner, woodcarvers from Chiniot, ajrak printers from Sindh, and women embroiderers from Balochistan prepare to showcase their skills to visitors who will soon fill the grounds.\n\nThe International Pavilion, which attracted much attention last year, is doubling in size this year-with around a dozen foreign countries participating to share their traditional crafts and performances alongside Pakistani artists. Flags of friendly nations already flutter above their designated spaces, adding to the global cultural charm of the festival.\n\nFederal Minister for National Heritage and Culture Aurangzeb Khichi said that Lok Mela represents Pakistan’s true soft power and creative strength. “It’s not merely a festival, it is the living heartbeat of our identity,” he said. “When our artisans, musicians, and storytellers gather here, they remind the world that Pakistan’s culture is its greatest source of unity and pride.”\n\nThe festival will come alive every evening with Cultural Nights dedicated to the rich musical traditions of each province.\n\nThe opening day, November 07, will feature a grand Inaugural Ceremony and Qawwali Night, setting a spiritual tone for the celebrations. Balochistan Night will follow on November 08, highlighting the deep rhythms and soulful dances of the region, while Punjab Night on November 09 will fill the air with bhangra beats and traditional folk songs.\n\nA special Dhol Mela on November 10 will celebrate the country’s rhythmic traditions, and the following evenings will spotlight the cultures of Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir, leading up to a Grand Closing Ceremony and Musical Night on November 16.\n\nExecutive Director, Lok Virsa Dr. Muhammad Waqas Saleem said that since its inception in 1981, Lok Mela has remained a symbol of Pakistan’s cultural continuity and resilience. “This is where the artisans of Pakistan tell their stories  through the textures of their crafts, the rhythm of their songs, and the beauty of their traditions,” he said.\n\nThe venue is being decorated with traditional motifs, regional flags, and handcrafted installations, while food courts are readying to serve sajji, chapli kebab, haleem, biryani, and jalebi-offering visitors a taste of Pakistan’s culinary diversity.\n\nSecurity, crowd management, and family-friendly facilities have also been enhanced to make the festival enjoyable for all.\n\nAs the final touches unfold-lights twinkling across pavilions, artisans arranging their masterpieces, and drums echoing in the background- the excitement in Islamabad is unmistakable.\n\nIn just a few days, the city will be awash in color, laughter, and song, as Lok Virsa’s Lok Mela 2025 once again becomes a living portrait of Pakistan’s unity, talent, and timeless heritage.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
