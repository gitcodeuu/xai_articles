  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 02 (APP): Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police arrested a suspect and impounded his vehicle after he allegedly assaulted Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) personnel during a routine checking in I-8 Markaz and fled from the scene.\n\nAn official told APP on Sunday that a traffic sergeant signaled a black Honda Civic for checking after witnessing dangerous driving.\n\nThe driver reportedly under the influence suddenly turned aggressive, shouting abuses, assaulting officers, tearing a sergeant’s uniform, snatching his official wireless set, and attempting to run them over with the vehicle.\n\nHe fled from the spot, and while escaping, opened straight fire with a pistol, creating panic among citizens.\n\nOn directions of Inspector General of Police (IGP) Islamabad Syed Ali Nasir Rizvi, CIA teams and SHO Industrial Area Police Station traced the suspect within hours and arrested him along with his vehicle.\n\nFIR No. 1366/25 has been registered under Sections 279, 382, 353, 186, 324, 506-II PPC and 7-ATA. Further investigation is underway.\n\nChief Traffic Officer (CTO) Capt. (R) Hamzah Humayun appreciated the swift coordinated action by CIA and SHO Shahid Zaman, stating:\n\n“Islamabad Police will not tolerate any attempt to harm police personnel on duty.\n\nRespect for law is mandatory — no one is above the law.”\n\nA government employee, Tahir Azad, told APP:\n\n“Police showed great performance by arresting the accused quickly. It boosts public trust.”\n\nAnother witness, Mudassir Ahmed, said citizens must respect police enforcing laws, adding that an inquiry can determine what sparked the altercation — but “violence is unjustified.”\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
