A free, responsible, and secure media is essential for the preservation of democracy and the rule of law.”\n\nReiterating Pakistan’s commitment to international principles of human rights and press freedom, the Chairman called upon all relevant institutions, civil society organizations, and the international community to work collectively to create an environment where journalists can perform their duties without fear or reprisal.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
