The initiative aligns national plans with the Doha Political Declaration and global commitments on social protection and financing for development.\n\nThe President will underline Pakistan’s intent to work closely with development partners and multilateral institutions to mobilise financing for social protection and green employment through mechanisms such as the SDG Stimulus, debt-for-social or climate swaps, and South–South cooperation under China’s Global Development Initiative.\n\nPresident Zardari will also reaffirm Pakistan’s commitment to translating the outcomes of the Doha Summit into concrete actions that strengthen social protection systems and support sustainable, inclusive economic growth.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
