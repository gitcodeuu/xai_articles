  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 03 (APP):The Supreme Court’s constitutional bench on Monday issued a notice to the Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in a suo motu case pertaining to the supply of contaminated water from Khanpur Dam.\n\nThe five-member bench, headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, Justice Shakeel Ahmed and Justice Aamer Farooq, heard the matter.\n\nDuring the proceedings, WAPDA’s counsel Hasan Raza informed the court that Khanpur Dam is the sole source of drinking water for around five million people. He stated that the number of boats operating in the dam has drastically increased — from 20 in the past to the present 326 — due to recreational activities and resorts, which has led to rising pollution levels. He added that the district administration continues to facilitate these activities.\n\nJustice Jamal Khan Mandokhail remarked that the Parks and Horticulture Authority (PHA) is also present and should formulate certain rules in this regard. Justice Shakeel Ahmed observed that the dam administration has the authority to prohibit motorboats.\n\nChief Justice Aamer Farooq questioned how so many boats were operating without permission, while Justice Mandokhail asked what measures WAPDA had taken to stop boating.\n\nThe counsel for WAPDA replied that an application had been filed before the magistrate, but the situation worsened after Khanpur was granted tehsil status.\n\nJustice Amin-ud-Din Khan asked WAPDA to propose alternatives if motorboats were contributing to pollution. The counsel responded that electric boats were available and could be used as an eco-friendly alternative.\n\nThe court then issued a notice to the Advocate General of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and adjourned the case indefinitely.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
