  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 03 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC)’s Justice Raja Inaam Ameen Minhas on Monday recused himself from hearing the interim bail plea of Director Anti-Corruption Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Siddique Anjum, who was nominated in the social media campaign case against Judge Humayun Dilawar.\n\nThe court sent the file to the Chief Justice IHC to transfer the case to another bench. Justice Inaam remarked that he has already given a decision on the petitioner’s request for dismissal of the case, so he cannot hear his other case.\n\nIt should be noted that some objections were also raised on the application by the Registrar’s Office. The Sessions Court has already rejected the interim bail of Siddique Anjum, after which he has approached the Islamabad High Court.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
