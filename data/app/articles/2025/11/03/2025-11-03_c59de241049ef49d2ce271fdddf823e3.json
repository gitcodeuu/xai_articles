  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 03 (APP): The Supreme Court’s constitutional bench on Monday issued notices to the parties concerned during the hearing of a case pertaining to the Speaker’s full access to the Governor House Sindh.\n\nThe five-member bench, headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan and comprising Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail, Justice Aqeel Ahmed Abbasi, Justice Shakeel Ahmed and Justice Aamer Farooq, took up the matter.\n\nAt the outset of the hearing, Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan addressed Governor Sindh Kamran Tessori’s counsel, suggesting, “You may sit together and resolve the matter yourselves.”\n\nJustice Aqeel Abbasi questioned what stage of legal proceedings the matter had reached.\n\nAdvocate Abid Zuberi, representing Governor Sindh, argued that the Sindh High Court had passed its order after just one hearing without issuing notices to the parties. “We appeared on the date given by the High Court, but a decision was issued without hearing us,” he added.\n\nDuring the hearing, counsel for the Speaker of the Sindh Assembly requested time, stating that the Speaker had contacted him only yesterday and he needed time to prepare.\n\nAfter hearing the arguments, the court adjourned the case.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
