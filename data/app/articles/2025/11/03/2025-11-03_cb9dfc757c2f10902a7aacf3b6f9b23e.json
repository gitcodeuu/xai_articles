  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 03 (APP): Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja on Monday announced that the government will launch the pilot phase of the National Data Exchange Layer (NDEL) in December — a key step toward Pakistan’s digital transformation.\n\nAddressing a press conference alongside Federal Ministers for Finance, Senator Muhammad Aurangzeb, Power, Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari, and Advisor to the Prime Minister on Privatisation, Muhammad Ali, she said the project is being developed by NADRA in close coordination with the Ministry of IT.\n\n“The National Data Exchange Layer will be a major breakthrough in building a connected and transparent digital ecosystem,” Shaza said.\n\n“It will make government services faster, simpler, and more convenient for citizens, while also improving the country’s tax and revenue systems.”\n\nNDEL aimed to interlink data across various government institutions, thereby improving governance, increasing transparency, and enhancing the efficiency of public services.\n\nThe implementation of the NDEL will facilitate the development of a new portal that provides online access to services like paying electricity bills, renewing ID cards, and verifying academic degrees, eliminating the need for citizens to visit offices in person.\n\nShe explained that after the project’s launch, citizens will no longer need to visit offices or stand in long queues for basic services. “Most government services will be available online — just one click away on mobile applications,” she said.\n\nCiting a Bank for International Settlements (BIS) study, the minister said that a 10 percent rise in digital payment adoption could boost GDP growth by one percent. “For Pakistan’s $400 billion economy, that means a potential $40 billion impact,” she added.\n\nShaza Fatima credited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for personally leading the digitalization drive. “The Prime Minister chairs meetings on digital payments himself, and his direct involvement has greatly accelerated progress,” she said.\n\nThe minister said over 45 million electricity bills have already been digitized with QR payment options through cooperation between the Ministry of Energy and the National IT Board.\n\nShe also highlighted that more than one million women opened digital bank accounts under the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP), and around eight million now use them for bill payments and other transactions.\n\n“This shows how a single decision can empower millions of women and bring them into the digital and financial mainstream,” she said.\n\nShe added that NADRA’s Pak ID app now supports QR-based payments for CNICs and family certificates, while the Islamabad Super App and Smart Islamabad have been integrated with Raast, Pakistan’s instant payment system.\n\n“Through Smart Islamabad apps, citizens paid over Rs1 billion in vehicle token taxes this year — all digitally, without visiting any office,” she said.\n\nThe government, she added, plans to extend such digital services nationwide to ensure that every citizen benefits from quick, safe, and transparent access to public services.\n\nShaza Fatima said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif personally monitors progress on digital transformation, with review meetings held every two weeks.\n\n“In June 2025, around 500,000 merchants were accepting digital payments. Our target is two million by June 2026, and by September, the number had already reached 570,000,” she said.\n\nSimilarly, digital banking users have surged to 112 million — surpassing the December target of 105 million and moving closer to the June 2026 goal of 120 million. “This rapid growth shows that digital adoption is now shaping the future of Pakistan’s economy,” she added.\n\nThe minister emphasized that digitalization promotes inclusion, especially for women. “The gender gap in financial inclusion currently stands at 33 percent. We aim to bring it down to 30 percent by June 2026,” she said.\n\nShe also spoke about the Prime Minister’s upcoming “Asaan Khidmat” initiative, under which 150 federal services will be digitized, with payments made electronically. “The Prime Minister has directed that all government payments managed by the Controller General of Accounts (CGA) be fully digital by June 2026,” she said.\n\nGovernment-to-government (G2G) and public-to-government (P2G) payments, including provincial and FBR transactions, will also be made 100 percent digital by that date.\n\nShaza Fatima said that these reforms will enhance efficiency, improve tax collection, encourage innovation, and create new opportunities for youth.\n\nShe highlighted three key benefits of digitalization — convenience, transparency, and efficiency. “People can now make payments or access services from home. Digitization ensures direct transfers without intermediaries and saves the government millions by reducing delays in payments,” she explained.\n\nShe added that the growing use of digital payments will also strengthen Pakistan’s credit system by giving banks reliable transaction records for assessing loans to individuals, farmers, and small businesses.\n\n“Expanding digital transactions will help bring Pakistan’s informal economy into the formal sector, increasing documentation and improving tax revenue,” she said.\n\nThe minister also announced that government-to-person (G2P) and person-to-government (P2G) payments have already been made digital, while coordination with provinces, AJK, and Gilgit-Baltistan is underway to implement the same reforms.\n\nDespite limited resources, Shaza Fatima said, the government remains determined to make Pakistan a cashless economy. “The Prime Minister has approved Rs3.5 billion for the Raast Merchant QR initiative to promote QR-based payments nationwide. This investment will help formalize the economy and enhance tax collection,” she added.\n\nShe said improving internet access through a stronger fibre network is also a priority. “Following the Prime Minister’s instructions, Right-of-Way charges for fibre installation have been abolished, and provinces are cooperating on this front,” she said.\n\nTo coordinate the digitalization agenda, three committees have been formed under the Prime Minister’s chairmanship — one led by the State Bank Governor to boost digital payments, another by Shaza Fatima to strengthen digital infrastructure, and the third by the Finance Minister to digitize government payments.\n\nOutlining the Digital Pakistan Roadmap, she said it is built on three pillars — a Digital Society, a Digital Economy, and a Digital Government. “Together, these pillars define our vision of a connected, innovative, and inclusive Pakistan,” Shaza said.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
