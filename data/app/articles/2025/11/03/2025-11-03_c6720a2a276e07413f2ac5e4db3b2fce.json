If this system works as promised, it will save people like me a lot of time and frustration.”\n\nAnother resident, Mustafa, added, “Digital records are a step in the right direction. It will reduce corruption and make the whole process much safer for buyers and sellers.”\n\nA spokesperson for the Capital Development Authority said: “This move is about creating a transparent and accountable process where citizens’ rights and investments are protected.”\n\n“The launch of the E-Stamp Paper system marks a significant step in Islamabad’s journey toward digital governance, combining modern technology with citizen-focused services to simplify one of the city’s most complex administrative processes,”he told APP.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
