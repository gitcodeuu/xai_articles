  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (APP):Federal Minister for Health Syed Mustafa Kamal on Monday said that Pakistan’s healthcare system is in a state of decline due to a lack of focus on prevention and public health awareness.\n\nAddressing a Pharmacovigilance Workshop, he said the global healthcare model has transformed and now emphasizes protecting people from falling ill rather than only treating diseases.\n\nHe added that the world has shifted towards lifestyle medicine, which promotes healthier living without relying solely on medication.\n\n“Hospitals in the country are under immense pressure because a proper primary healthcare system is missing,” he said, adding that “healthcare begins outside hospitals.”\n\nHighlighting the deteriorating sanitation situation, he said, “We don’t even have a concept of proper sewage treatment in Pakistan.”\n\nHe pointed out that contaminated water is the major cause of diseases, responsible for nearly 70 percent of illnesses in the country.\n\n“If clean water is ensured, the burden of patients on hospitals would drop by 70 percent,” he emphasized, adding that polluted water flowing from Gilgit-Baltistan to Karachi continues to spread diseases.\n\nHe said establishing sewage treatment systems at the local level was essential to control waterborne diseases.\n\nKamal stressed that “prevention is better than cure,” and Pakistan’s national health strategy must prioritize precautionary and preventive measures.\n\n“We need to adopt a healthier lifestyle,” he said, noting that lifestyle medicine is closely aligned with the natural order of health.\n\nHe remarked that while the world will likely overcome cancer within the next decade, Pakistan may still be debating whether vaccines are halal or haram.\n\nThe health minister said Pakistan, unfortunately, ranks among the top countries for hepatitis, diabetes, and heart diseases.\n\nHe further said that a comprehensive Healthcare Management System is being developed at the National Institute of Health to improve service delivery and efficiency.\n\nKamal emphasized that Pakistan needs committed and ethical doctors to bring real reform and improvement in the healthcare system.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
