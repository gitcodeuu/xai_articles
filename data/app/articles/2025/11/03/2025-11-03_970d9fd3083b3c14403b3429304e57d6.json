During the address, initiatives of global significance were put forward, including the development of inclusive education, the convening of an international forum of experts on AI ethics, the establishment of an International Institute of Digital Heritage, and the adoption of joint effective measures to counteract the spread of biased information, public manipulation, and discrimination in virtual space. These approaches demonstrate that Uzbekistan is a reliable partner in international diplomacy and the humanitarian sphere.\nUzbekistan’s policies aimed at protecting the rights of women and youth, as well as addressing climate challenges, reflect a humanistic character and underscore the country’s commitment to social justice and sustainable development. On the international stage, Uzbekistan has introduced a new concept of humanitarian diplomacy, based on the principles of unity, dialogue, and trust.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
