  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 03 (APP):An Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) on Monday directed the police to complete the identification parade of arrested workers of a banned religious party, otherwise the case would be dismissed.\n\nAnti-Terrorism Court Judge Abual Hasanat Muhammad Zulqarnain heard the case.\n\nDuring the hearing, a request was filed by the police to postpone the identity parade, to which the court expressed strong anger and said that these people are not sheep and goats; why is the police not conducting the identity parade?\n\nThe court remarked that their families have been suffering for several days; what is their fault? What you people are doing is not a procedure. The court summoned the concerned SSP and DIG, on which SSP Investigation Usman Tariq appeared in the court.\n\nThe court clarified that if the identity parade is not completed within two to three days, the case will be dismissed. The court later adjourned the hearing of the case.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
