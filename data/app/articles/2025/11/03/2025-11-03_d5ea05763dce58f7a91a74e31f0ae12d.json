The port, he added, has the potential to deliver a large share of the national revenue target owing to its industrial complex and strategic location along key shipping routes.\n\nThe minister also highlighted the government’s $13 billion savings plan for the country in the next decade through the establishment of the country’s first “Sea-to-Steel Green Maritime Industrial Corridor, designed to revive Pakistan Steel Mills.\n\nThe initiative, he said, will integrate port operations with industrial activity, creating a continuous value chain from maritime logistics to steel manufacturing.\n\nIn the second phase of the project, Minister Chaudhry said the Iron Ore and Coal Berth (IOCB) terminal to oversee its revival.\n\nHe said an Integrated Maritime Industrial Complex (IMIC) will be established there, linking ship recycling facilities with steel production to enhance domestic output and generate employment. “The ‘Steel-to-Green Sea’ project will be jointly implemented by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and the Ministry of Industries to ensure sustainable industrial development,” he added.\n\nThe minister said the Port Qasim Authority (PQA) is also driving multiple projects aimed at expanding capacity and improving efficiency.\n\nHe cited the development of new multipurpose and container terminals, the Port Qasim Special Economic Zone (PQSEZ), and the integration of environment-friendly “Green Port” technologies.\n\nThese, he said, are part of a broader modernization plan that also includes dredging, improved cargo handling systems, and digital connectivity to facilitate trade flows.\n\nMinister Chaudhry said the PQSEZ will serve as a modern industrial and logistics hub attracting both local and foreign investment.\n\nHe added that enhanced connectivity through upgraded road, rail, and communication networks will reduce logistics costs and strengthen national trade competitiveness.\n\nEnergy and industrial projects, including LNG terminals and power plants within the port area, are also contributing to Pakistan’s energy security and industrial growth.\n\nReaffirming the government’s commitment to maritime-led development, Junaid Chaudhry said modernization of port infrastructure, expansion of trade corridors, and creation of specialized industrial zones were central to achieving long-term economic stability.\n\n“The vision is to make Port Qasim not just a cargo handling facility, but a comprehensive maritime-industrial ecosystem powering Pakistan’s future growth,” he said.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
