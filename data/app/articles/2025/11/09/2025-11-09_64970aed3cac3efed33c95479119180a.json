  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 09 (APP): The Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) Immigration Wing at Islamabad International Airport foiled a bid to travel abroad using forged immigration stamps and offloaded a passenger attempting to fly to Malaysia.\n\nAn FIA official told APP on Sunday that the accused, identified as Nabeel Akhtar, a resident of Rawalpindi, was intercepted while attempting to board Flight PK-894 bound for Malaysia.\n\nDuring scrutiny, FIA officers discovered fake arrival and departure stamps on the passenger’s passport. Upon verification, no corresponding record was found in the official immigration system.\n\nThe suspect was immediately taken into custody and handed over to the Anti-Human Trafficking Circle, Islamabad for further legal proceedings.\n\nAccording to the FIA spokesperson, the agency is maintaining strict vigilance at all entry and exit points to curb human smuggling and illegal travel attempts.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
