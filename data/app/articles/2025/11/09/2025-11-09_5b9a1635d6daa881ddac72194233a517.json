  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 08 (APP): The Islamabad District Administration teams have conducted indoor spraying at 912 houses and carried out fogging at 1,159 identified hotspots in both urban and rural zones.\n\nAccording to the latest dengue surveillance report, in total, 37,863 locations were inspected for potential breeding sites and other risk factors contributing to the spread of the virus.\n\nThe report confirmed that 21 new dengue patients were detected during the last 24 hours — 15 from rural areas and 6 from urban sectors. At present, 35 patients are under treatment in various hospitals across the federal capital.\n\nDuring inspections, larvae were found positive at 157 sites, while 7 sites showed negative results, indicating a gradual decline in the presence of dengue larvae compared to earlier findings.\n\nThe administration has directed field teams to continue operations without interruption in all high-risk areas, especially in neighborhoods where repeated breeding activity has been reported. The surveillance and response teams have been instructed to maintain strict monitoring and ensure immediate fumigation wherever larvae are detected.\n\nAccording to the district administration, several places violating dengue Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) were sealed, and multiple individuals were detained for non-compliance. These actions are part of the ongoing enforcement measures to ensure that building owners, residents, and commercial units adhere to preventive guidelines.\n\nOfficials stated that health departments and hospital administrations are maintaining continuous treatment services in dedicated dengue wards. Medical staff remain on alert to provide timely care, and essential medicines are being supplied regularly to all government hospitals treating dengue patients.\n\nThe administration emphasized that despite ongoing efforts, lasting control of dengue depends on public cooperation. Citizens have been urged to inspect their homes, rooftops, and surrounding areas for stagnant water, as it provides ideal conditions for mosquito breeding.\n\nThe surveillance teams have been particularly active in inspecting construction sites, junkyards, nurseries, and open water containers, as these are recognized as recurring sources of dengue larvae. Awareness activities are also being carried out to guide the public on preventive steps such as covering water tanks, cleaning roof gutters, and using mosquito repellents.\n\nDistrict authorities reaffirmed that their efforts are aimed at preventing the situation from escalating during the peak dengue season. The campaign will remain active until the risk period subsides, with daily monitoring reports being shared to assess progress and plan further interventions.\n\nOfficials reiterated that continued vigilance, regular inspections, and community participation remain key to keeping Islamabad safe from dengue outbreaks.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
