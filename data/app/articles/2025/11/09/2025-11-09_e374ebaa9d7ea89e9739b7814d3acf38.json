In line with past parliamentary practice and considering the significance of the proposed constitutional amendments as well as the need for broader deliberations on the subject, the Standing Committee on Law and Justice is directed to invite the chairman and members of the Standing Committee on Law and Justice of the National Assembly to participate in its proceedings and share input on the bill,” the Chairman Senate said.\n\nEarlier, Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Tariq Fazal Chaudhry moved a motion in the House to suspend the regular agenda in order to introduce the 27th Constitutional Amendment.\n\nSpeaking in the Senate, Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar said that the 27th constitutional amendment bill had 49 clauses. “There are three main areas and two ancillary and it will address five subject areas,” he said.\n\nThe minister that one of the things agreed in the Charter of Democracy signed in 2006 was the formation of a federal constitutional court which would have superior court judges from all provinces and hear constitutional matters while regular courts would continue to hear all other matters.\n\n“During consultations on the 26th Constitutional Amendment, some of our friends suggested to refrain from making such a huge change and to experiment by making constitutional benches,” he said.\n\nThe minister said that constitutional benches had been made but judges spent most of their time listening to such matters and other cases during the rest of the time. Some argued that constitutional benches were a “court within a court” and also raised other objections, he said.\n\nThe existing Supreme Court and High Courts would continue to handle civil, criminal, rent, family, and corporate cases, helping to reduce the heavy backlog of more than 60,000 pending cases, he said.\n\nThe Minister said it has also been proposed that the   President may transfer a Judge of a High Court from one High Court to another on the recommendation of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan. For this purpose the chief justices of both high courts shall also be members of the Judicial Commission of Pakistan.\n\nThe minister added that the draft included provisions to ensure protection of seniority, prevent disputes over the transfer and tenure of judges, and provide procedural safeguards in consultation with Chief Justices of relevant High Courts.\n\nThe minister said that the 27th Amendment aimed to ensure coherence in defense command structure, remove ambiguities, and recognize meritorious military service while maintaining constitutional oversight.\n\nRegarding amendment to Article 243, he said that in light of Pakistan’s strategic defense developments and recent national circumstances, clarifications had been proposed regarding the appointment and status of the Chief of Defence Forces, a title to be held by the Chief of Army Staff, while also giving constitutional recognition to honorary titles such as Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force, and Admiral of the Fleet.\n\nHe emphasized that these titles were to honor national heroes and that any conferment or withdrawal would fall under the purview of Parliament, not the executive, underscoring the principle that such honors reflect the nation’s collective will.\n\nHe also explained that the appointment of the chief of air staff and chief of naval staff will be made on the advice of the Prime Minister.\n\nHe said the office of the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee shall stand abolished with effect from 27 November 2025.\n\nAzam Nazeer Tarar said the Prime Minister shall, on the recommendation of the Chief of the Army Staff concurrently the Chief of the Defense Forces, appoint the Commander of the National Strategic Command from the members  of Pakistan Army and shall also determine his salaries and allowances.\n\nHe said that where the Federal Government promotes a member of the Armed Forces to the rank of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet, such officer shall retain the rank, privileges and remain in uniform for life. Upon completion of the term of his command, under the law, the Federal Government shall determine the responsibilities and duties of Field Marshal, Marshal of the Air Force or Admiral of the Fleet in the interest of State.\n\nAmendment has also been sought in article 248, proposing that no criminal proceedings whatsoever shall be initiated or continued against the President for his life and for a Governor during his term of office in any court.\n\nTarar also highlighted other key aspects of the amendment, including synchronized Senate elections, cabinet size adjustments for smaller provinces like Balochistan, and provisions related to the President’s advisory powers.\n\nHe said that the government had also consulted its allied parties- the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), and Balochistan Awami Party (BAP), and welcomed further debate in the Standing Committee on Law and Justice to refine the proposals.\n\nAzam Tarar said that the amendments were framed with the intent to stabilize the constitutional system, ensure democratic continuity, and prevent any future misuse of judicial powers, stating that “laws are made for the people of Pakistan, and the amendments proposed are aimed at strengthening institutions, not personalities.”\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
