  "content": "RIYADH, Oct 28 (APP):Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday urged the global north to develop synergy and unity with the global south for transfer of technology and resource sharing for ensuring shared prosperity of humanity bracing adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation.\n\nThe prime minister opined these views while participating in a high-level roundtable discussion on the topic “Is Humanity Heading in the Right Direction?” under the 9th Edition of the Future Investment Initiative Conference 2025 in Riyadh.\n\nPM Shehbaz called for mutual cooperation to support countries like Pakistan that are battered by the climate catastrophes and ruled out loans as the only option to recover. He added that repeated loans would erode the economic might of such countries stagnating economic development.\n\nTherefore, he said if humanity had to move forward then it should proceed in unison, share its bounties and grievances together and share modern technologies s with those countries which can use it to grow its production in the areas of agriculture, industry, and employment among others.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also extended felicitations to the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia for the event and his vision to transform societies like he has done in Saudi Arabia.\n\n“I represent the country which is rich in resources and ever since our inception we have made very honest mistakes and learnt from it. We all are human beings, prone to mistake but important is to learn from your mistakes,” he said.\n\nPM Shehbaz informed the forum the massive reforms being implemented in Pakistan and termed them the most robust changes and deep rooted reforms that were direly required at this time.\n\n“For example our Federal Board of Revenue, the tax collecting institution has been completely digitized and we are attacking corruption with full might…but Rome was not built overnight. We are undertaking industrial reforms and have a youth bulge as 60 per cent of our population is very young and…it’s a challenge as well as an opportunity,” the prime minister said.\n\nThe government of Pakistan was offering its youth skill trainings and lot of other portfolios for productive employment, he added. Pakistan, an agrarian economy, is among the top 10 countries which are exposed to the vagaries of weather and climate change despite its least share in the global warming.\n\n“Our GHG emissions are less than the fraction of one percent yet in 2022 we faced devastating cloudburst floods and storms and our economic losses reached around 130 billion dollars. Large swathes of our land under were water, crops were destroyed and millions of houses were destroyed and then we have to borrow loans to rebuild the areas that were devastated,” he said.\n\nHe added that in 2025 again, Pakistan had witnessed terrible floods and cloudbursts leaving it absolutely helpless. “This is not acceptable and it should not be the direction for humanity to proceed in times of crisis,” he said.\n\nPrime Minister Sharif added that the country was striving to recover and revive its economy but it had to be shared by the global humanity to come to the rescue of suffering humanity otherwise this lopsided system would provide devastating results.\n\nPakistan, he said is resolved to become one of the most going countries through hardwork, untiring  efforts, collating its youth, natural resources and strength to emerge as an honourable country in the comity of nations by the grace of God.\n\nResponding to a query, he said Pakistan is already set and speedily moving towards AI and technology adoption.\n\nHowever, AI has its pros and cons that demanded the global north to come for a dialogue on AI for its positive, productive use and have synergy with global south.\n\nPakistan is equipping its youth with AI, IT and technology using all out means to create hubs and data centers that requires huge investment, he added.\n\nThe prime minister mentioned his father’s struggle of reviving from turmoil after nationalization of his one of the largest steel engineering plants in the country in 1972, enunciating the message of untiring effort, indomitable resolve and tireless efforts as the cornerstone to achieve unimaginable outcomes in times of extreme crisis.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
