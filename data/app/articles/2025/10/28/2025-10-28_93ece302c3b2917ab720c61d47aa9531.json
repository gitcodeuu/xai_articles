During the visit, he expressed satisfaction over the pace and quality of work and directed that construction standards must be upheld at all costs.\n\n“There will be no compromise on quality or speed,” said Minister Naqvi. “The completion of the T-Chowk Flyover will allow commuters from GT Road to reach Islamabad without any traffic signals, marking a major milestone in resolving urban traffic congestion.”\n\nThe minister emphasized that the T-Chowk Flyover will significantly improve traffic flow, while the Shaheen Chowk Underpass will serve as a modern addition to Islamabad’s development landscape.\n\nNaqvi instructed authorities to maintain round-the-clock (24/7) construction work to ensure timely completion within the next 30 days, stressing that the early conclusion of these projects is crucial to reduce public inconvenience, especially during school hours and peak traffic times.\n\n“Relieving citizens from traffic problems is our top priority,” he added.\n\nEarlier, the Member Engineering of the CDA briefed the Interior Minister on the latest progress and construction timelines for both projects.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
