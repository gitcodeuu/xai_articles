  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 07 (APP):The Supreme Court has issued the written verdict in the case of Justice Tariq Jahangiri. The five-page judgment, authored by Justice Amin-uddin Khan, was uploaded to the court’s official website on Tuesday.\nJustice Shahid Bilal endorsed the judgment but also added a separate five-page note expressing his additional views.\nIn his note, Justice Shahid Bilal observed that in the present case, the bench proceeded with the matter without deciding on the preliminary objections, which, he stated, was legally incorrect.\nHe added that continuing proceedings without first addressing the objections had no legal standing. According to him, disposing of the objections along with the final decision was inconsistent with established legal procedure, and the Islamabad High Court had failed to follow the proper legal process in this case.\nJustice Bilal further pointed out that the High Court did not clearly establish the petitioner’s legal standing or provide solid grounds for dismissing the objections. He stated that the proceedings were advanced without sufficient justification.\nHe also emphasized that Justice Jahangiri was barred from performing judicial work without being given an opportunity to be heard, which he termed a violation of the principles of the nature of justice.\nThe Supreme Court also clarified that the issue of obtaining information about a judge had already been settled in a previous decision of the court.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
