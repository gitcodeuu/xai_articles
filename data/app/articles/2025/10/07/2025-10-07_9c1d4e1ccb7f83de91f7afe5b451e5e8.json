  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP):The District & Sessions Court of Islamabad on Tuesday directed Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatha to submit their written replies on the charge sheet in the controversial tweet case by the next hearing on October 11.\nAdditional District and Sessions Judge Muhammad Afzal Majoka heard the case, where both accused, Imaan Mazari and Hadi Ali Chatha, appeared in court.\nDuring the proceedings, their representatives requested the court to postpone the hearing, citing the unavailability of defense lawyers.\nThe prosecution opposed the request, arguing that the accused were using delay tactics. Prosecutor Usman Rana told the court that the same excuse was made during the previous hearing and urged the court to continue the trial without further delay.\nJudge Majoka remarked that if Hadi Ali Chatha’s lawyer failed to appear at the next hearing, the court would appoint a state counsel to represent him. The court was informed that both accused had yet to submit their written responses to the charge sheet.\nAfter hearing the arguments, the judge directed Mazari and Chatha to submit their replies by the next date and adjourned the hearing until October 11.\nIt is worth mentioning that the case was registered by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency against the two over a controversial post on social media.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
