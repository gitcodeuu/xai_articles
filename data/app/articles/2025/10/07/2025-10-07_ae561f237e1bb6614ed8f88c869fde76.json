Participants then took part in a practical session, where they learned to design and assemble their own rockets using PET bottles and simple, low-cost materials.\nThe highlight of the workshop was the rocket launching activity, where teachers proudly launched the rockets they had built, witnessing the real-time application of physics in action.\nThe excitement and joy of watching their creations soar high into the sky turned abstract scientific concepts into a memorable learning experience.\nThe Islamabad workshop is part of a nationwide series organized by SUPARCO in Karachi, Lahore, Peshawar, and Gilgit, reflecting Pakistan’s active engagement in global space education initiatives.\nWorld Space Week (October 4–10) is celebrated annually in more than 90 countries to mark humankind’s achievements in space science and technology.\nThe 2025 theme, “Sustaining Space for Sustainability on Earth,” highlights how innovations in space exploration contribute to solving global challenges. Through activities like the Water Rocket Workshop, SUPARCO continues to nurture scientific curiosity among youth and educators, aligning with its mission to promote STEM education across Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
