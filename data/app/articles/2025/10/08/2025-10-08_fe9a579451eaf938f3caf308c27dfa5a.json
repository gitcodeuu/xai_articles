This chronic scourge, imported and fueled by malicious machinations, remains a shared menace across our region, where traitorous elements, in collusion with international terrorism, target peace, security, and stability, he added.\nThe ambassador said confronting this ominous phenomenon demands collective, determined, and united efforts, both regionally and internationally. He said all countries must play an active role in uprooting every form and manifestation of terrorism and violent extremism, which have claimed the lives of countless innocent people over the past decades.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
