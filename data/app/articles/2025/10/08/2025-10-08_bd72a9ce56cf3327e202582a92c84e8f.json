  "content": "ISLAMABAD, October 08 (APP):Saudi national Dr. Omar M. Yaghi, along with Susumu Kitagawa of Japan and Richard Robson of Australia, has been awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their groundbreaking development of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of materials with vast applications in gas storage, catalysis, and environmental protection.\nThe Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced the award recognizing the three scientists “for the development of metal–organic frameworks,” a transformative contribution that has opened new frontiers in materials chemistry.\nAccording to Saudi Press Attache Dr. Naif Al-Otaibi on Wednesday, the Nobel-winning research builds upon seminal works by each laureate: Omar M. Yaghi – “Design and Synthesis of an Exceptionally Stable and Highly Porous Metal–Organic Framework”, Susumu Kitagawa – “Functional Porous Coordination Polymers” and Richard Robson – “A Net-Based Approach to Coordination Polymers”.\nDr. Yaghi’s recognition marks a historic moment for Saudi Arabia, as he becomes one of the first Saudi scientists to receive a Nobel Prize in the sciences. His work has been celebrated for its innovative approach to building crystalline frameworks with atomic-level precision, revolutionizing how chemists design and utilize porous materials.\nCongratulatory messages poured in from around the world including Pakistan. Taking to social media platform X, Raja Mohsin Ijaz wrote: “Amazing! Heartfelt congratulations to Saudi scientist Omar Yaghi for this outstanding achievement in Chemistry!”\nAbrar Ishaq Rana added: “MashaAllah & Alhamdulillah. Heartiest congratulations to Dr. Omar Yaghi on this remarkable achievement! His pioneering contributions have brought immense pride to the Kingdom and the Muslim world – a true inspiration for scientists everywhere!”\nSohail Iqbal Bhatti also congratulated all three laureates, stating: “Heartfelt congratulations to Omar Yaghi, Susumu Kitagawa, and Richard Robson on winning the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry.”\nDr. Yaghi’s award is being hailed across the Kingdom and beyond as a testament to Saudi Arabia’s growing global presence in science, innovation, and higher education.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
