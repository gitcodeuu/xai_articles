He extended gratitude to US President Donald Trump and the leadership of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Turkiye, Jordan, Egypt, and Indonesia for their efforts during the UNGA-80 session, where they met Trump to advance the cause of resolving the Palestine issue.\nHighlighting recent developments, the Prime Minister said that the statement issued by Hamas offers a ray of hope for a ceasefire and provides a pathway to ensuring peace. He stressed that this opportunity must not be allowed to close again. “Pakistan, In-sha-Allah, will continue to work hand in hand with its friendly and brotherly nations for permanent peace in Palestine,” he reaffirmed.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
