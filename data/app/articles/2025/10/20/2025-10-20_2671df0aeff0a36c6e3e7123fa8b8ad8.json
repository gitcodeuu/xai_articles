He said the late scientist had told him that success comes when every individual, from a security guard to a scientist, considers themselves part of a national mission.\\n\\nHighlighting economic progress, Prof Ahsan Iqbal said that when the present government took office, the country faced the threat of default, but under the leadership of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan not only avoided bankruptcy but achieved economic stabilization and growth within two years. He termed this recovery an exemplary achievement and said that today the world recognizes Pakistan’s improving economic outlook.\\n\\nPaying tribute to the armed forces, he said Pakistan’s military had given a befitting response to Indian aggression and made tremendous sacrifices in the war against terrorism. “The nation is proud of its martyrs, and our armed forces’ courage and professionalism are a source of strength for every Pakistani,” he added.\\n\\nThe minister said the government’s “Uraan Pakistan” vision focuses on empowering youth through education and employment so that they can play an effective role in the country’s development. He reiterated that Pakistan cannot afford extremism or instability and that social harmony and progress must go hand in hand.\\n\\nThe planning minister said the National Rescue Challenge 2025 strengthens professional skills, discipline, and coordination among emergency service institutions. Fifteen national teams from Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Gilgit-Baltistan participated, showcasing live rescue operations including accident response, firefighting, and high-angle and deep-water rescues.\\n\\nProf Ahsan Iqbal said such competitions enhance the technical capacity of rescue teams and foster inter-provincial cooperation and knowledge exchange. He noted that a nation’s progress depends on protecting its human capital and efficiently managing emergencies, and that Rescue 1122 has become a symbol of both.\\n\\nHe said that the Ministry of Planning is determined to promote a results-based culture in all public institutions to ensure Pakistan’s safe, sustainable, and prosperous future.\\n\\nProvincial Minister Khawaja Salman Rafique, Director General Rescue 1122 Dr Rizwan Naseer, and other senior officials also attended the event.\\n\\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
