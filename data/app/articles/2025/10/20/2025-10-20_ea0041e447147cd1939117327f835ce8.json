  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 20 (APP): The Pakistan Advanced Materials Forum (PAMF) has announced to hold the 19th International Symposium on Advanced Materials (ISAM) in Islamabad from October 27–31, bringing together leading global scientists, engineers, academicians and industry experts to discuss the latest innovations in materials science and engineering.\nSince its inception in 1989, ISAM has become Pakistan’s flagship scientific event and one of the most prestigious international forums in South and Southeast Asia. The symposium highlights the critical role of materials science in driving Pakistan’s transformation toward a knowledge-based, high-tech, and sustainable economy.\nThis year’s symposium will feature plenary and keynote lectures by world-renowned experts, along with technical sessions, poster presentations and panel discussions on recent advances and emerging trends in materials research. An industrial exhibition will also showcase the latest innovations, technologies, and applications developed through advanced materials engineering.\nIn an interaction with APP, Dr. Anjum Tauqir from the Institute of Space Technology (IST) said that ISAM has become a cornerstone of Pakistan’s scientific landscape, strengthening engagement with the global research community and inspiring young scientists and engineers to contribute to national development through innovation in materials science.\nThe symposium will focus on cutting-edge themes such as artificial intelligence in materials research, additive manufacturing, advanced materials characterization, corrosion control, and smart coatings.\nA special poster session on engineering failure analysis will provide valuable insights for both public and private sector industries, emphasizing lessons from material and component failures to improve safety, reliability, and performance.\nThe event also aims to bridge academia, research, and industry by promoting technology transfer and encouraging the commercialization of scientific discoveries. The discussions are expected to support key national sectors, including energy, environment, health, construction, electronics, and defence, while fostering collaboration between scientists, engineers, and policymakers.\nAccording to the organizers of the event, ISAM 2025 will play a vital role in addressing the challenges of Pakistan’s ageing industrial infrastructure.\nBy promoting research-based solutions and fostering partnerships, the symposium aims to reduce dependence on imported technologies and encourage modernization of the country’s manufacturing and industrial systems.\nThese developments are expected to enhance industrial safety, sustainability, and competitiveness while creating new opportunities for skilled professionals and innovators.\nThe participants will also visit Pakistan’s expanding research infrastructure, including modern laboratories equipped with state-of-the-art tools such as Scanning Electron Microscopes and X-ray diffractometers, reflecting the country’s growing capability to support high-level research and develop a future-ready technical workforce.\nA PAMF spokesperson said materials science is the backbone of modern innovation, driving progress across every major industry from clean energy and electronics to aerospace and national defence. “ISAM 2025 will not only showcase Pakistan’s scientific achievements but also help establish stronger global collaborations to accelerate our transition toward a knowledge-based and sustainable economy,” the spokesperson added.\nResearch presented at ISAM often emphasizes sustainable materials and green technologies, directly contributing to environmental protection, efficient resource use, and cleaner industrial practices.\nThe symposium’s outcomes are expected to promote economic growth, job creation, and technological advancement while improving the overall quality of life.\nOver the years, ISAM has become a symbol of Pakistan’s scientific strength and commitment to innovation. The participation of international experts alongside Pakistani researchers, students, and industrial representatives underscores the country’s growing role in global scientific collaboration.\nThe Pakistan Advanced Materials Forum (PAMF) has been promoting materials science and engineering in Pakistan for over three decades. Since organizing the first ISAM in 1989, it has worked to build scientific capacity, foster research excellence, and connect Pakistan’s scientific community with global networks dedicated to advancing technology and sustainable development.\\n\\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
