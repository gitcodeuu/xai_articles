This initiative, which was outlined at the meeting, aims to address the profound and unprecedented shifts occurring in the international order.\n\nLiu Zhenmin, a prominent Chinese diplomat, highlighted the initiative’s importance in his article History as Our Guide: Toward a Better Future for Global Order. According to Liu, as the world faces transformations in the international landscape, especially in major-country relations, China believes that nations must work collaboratively to build a peaceful, stable, and balanced world order.\n\nThe article emphasizes the need for nations to actively engage in the reform of the global governance system. Liu argued that the 80th anniversary of the United Nations (UN) offers an important opportunity to push for changes that will address global challenges, including those related to economic globalization, geopolitics, and international law.\n\nIn line with the evolving global landscape, the United Nations is taking significant steps toward reform. In September 2024, the UN held its first “Summit of the Future,” where it adopted the Pact for the Future, recommending 19 actions for global governance reform. In parallel, UN Secretary-General António Guterres launched the UN80 Initiative on the occasion of the UN’s 80th anniversary, setting in motion key processes to reshape the UN’s role and effectiveness.\n\nGuterres’ initiative, focusing on safeguarding the UN’s core missions, enhancing its authority, and addressing the critical issue of representation, aims to ensure that the UN can continue to provide vital services to all nations and address the needs of humanity at large.\n\nAs a major developing country, China has reiterated its commitment to both its national development and the reform of the global governance system. China aims to deepen its engagement in the making of international rules and strengthen its leadership in global governance.\n\n“While pursuing its own development, China must engage deeply with other Global South countries to advocate for an inclusive, multipolar world order that is fair and beneficial for all,” said President Xi at the SCO+ meeting. China’s approach calls for the continued promotion of peaceful coexistence, stability, and equitable development for all nations.\n\n2025 marks the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II and the establishment of the UN, events that forever altered the course of human history. Over the past eight decades, the UN-centered international system and the international law-based global order have helped maintain global peace, fostered development, and advanced progress worldwide.\n\nLiu Zhenmin observes, the world now stands at a new historical crossroads. The continued evolution of the contemporary international order will require all nations to address the challenges of a changing global landscape, including the economic centers, and emerging global risks.\n\n“At this juncture, it is essential to reflect on the lessons of the past and the opportunities of the future,” Liu said. “Only through collaboration and a commitment to justice can we shape an international order that works for everyone.”\n\nAs the world continues to face unprecedented challenges, the reform of global governance and the fostering of a shared future for humanity are becoming ever more pressing issues. China’s proactive stance in these efforts signals its growing role as a key player in global decision-making and its continued commitment to a more just and equitable international system.\n\nChina’s Global Governance Initiative represents a bold vision for a new international order — one rooted in cooperation, fairness, and shared prosperity. As nations prepare for the next phase of reform, the emphasis on multilateralism, inclusivity, and collective responsibility will likely define the global trajectory in the years to come.\n\nWith the 80th anniversary of the UN on the horizon, 2025 presents an ideal moment for reflection, action, and collaboration toward a more stable and harmonious world order.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
