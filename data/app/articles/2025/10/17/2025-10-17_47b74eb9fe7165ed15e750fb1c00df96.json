  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Friday said that the protest calls from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) for today were inconclusive and had ended up in a no-show.\nTalking to the media, the minister said cities and markets were bustling, as people from all walks of life, including traders, had completely rejected their calls for protest.\nTarar said the public is celebrating Pakistan’s crucial role in the Gaza peace process and its foreign policy successes.\nHe specifically highlighted the honor Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif received from President of the United States Donald Trump who invited the prime minister to address on the occasion of Gaza peace process in Sharmal Sheikh.\nThe minister reiterated that Pakistan has been strongly advocating for an independent Palestine with Al Quds Sharif as its capital, and has condemned Israeli oppression at every platform.\nPakistan is being taken seriously on the global stage following its successes from the “Mark-e-Haq,” leading to greater respect for its people worldwide, he said, adding “this is the respect for Pakistan and it is the Almighty’s blessing that the foreign policy is progressing in the right direction, elevating the status of green passport.”\nThe minister also condemned the “political stunt” of Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Sohail Afridi, who did not attend a high-level meeting chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the repatriation of Afghan refugees.\nTarar noted that the meeting, which lauded the sacrifices of Pakistani soldiers, involved important decision-making and follow-up on previous decisions.\nHe stressed that all provincial governments and institutional representatives were present, except for the CM KPK.\nWhile CM Advisor Muzamil Hassan attended and briefed the federal government on various initiatives, including a support program for police martyrs, the minister stressed that the CM’s presence was highly crucial given the importance of law and order matters in his province.\nTarar noted that abstaining from the meeting might be a “political stunt” to garner praise on social media, but it would have a serious impact on the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nHe argued that the CM would waste time understanding the background when he held his own briefing later.\nThe minister called the political point-scoring over an important law and order meeting “regrettable”. “The KPK CM’s absence showed that he did not believe in discussions,” he added.",
