Members emphasized that these allotments must be made on an ownership basis as originally promised, instead of being converted to a rental policy.\nThe Committee called upon the Council of Common Interests (CCI) to urgently convene and resolve the constitutional and administrative status of the WWF. It directed the Ministry to submit a chronological record of CCI deliberations along with any related legal documents or opinions, to ensure clarity and transparency between the federal and provincial levels.\nWhile acknowledging that WWF collections have significantly increased in recent years, members of the Committee stressed that all financial figures must be verified through audited accounts and reconciled ledgers before being accepted. The Committee emphasized that transparency and fiscal integrity must remain at the heart of all WWF operations.\nThe Committee also observed a clear gap between WWF’s reported progress and on-ground realities. It demanded documentary evidence for all major projects, particularly the Zone-V housing scheme. The Committee directed WWF to furnish complete beneficiary lists, project dossiers, and details of any disciplinary or legal actions taken in cases of irregularities.\nChairman Syed Rafiullah observation reflected the Committee’s concern that claims of public service must be backed by results visible to workers and beneficiaries on the ground.\nThe Committee also sought detailed updates on a range of projects including the F-6 WWF office reconstruction, Rawat land project, and the status of WWF schools in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, along with teacher and staff rosters. It further requested information on assistance to coal-mine workers, the Fund’s investment policy and returns, and a complete inventory of WWF assets with ownership and maintenance details.\nMembers also recommended that WWF employees be provided with the same welfare facilities as the workers they serve. The Committee also urged the Ministry to implement a comprehensive health insurance scheme to ensure medical coverage and welfare protection for all workers across the country.\nThe meeting was attended by MNAs Nasir Iqbal Bosal, Saeeda Jamshid, Erum Hamid, Fateh Ullah Khan, Zulfiqar Ali Behan, Dr. Mehreen Razzaq Bhutto, Farhan Chishti, and Sofia Saeed Shah (virtually), along with senior officials from the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development.\nConcluding the session, the Committee reaffirmed its commitment to transparency, accountability, and protection of workers’ rights. It urged the Ministry and WWF to align all welfare initiatives with constitutional clarity, public trust, and principles of good governance, ensuring that every worker benefits directly and fairly from the nation’s welfare programs\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
