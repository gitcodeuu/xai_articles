  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): The federal government on Friday decided to ensure expedited and dignified repatriation of Afghan nationals without further extension.\nThe decision was made after a high-level meeting chaired by the prime minister on the repatriation of Afghan refugees, where the PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s longstanding commitment to supporting Afghanistan in times of difficulty but noted that continued involvement of Afghan nationals in cross-border terrorism was a matter of grave concern.\nPrime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif directed all provincial governments and relevant federal institutions to work in close coordination to ensure the early and orderly repatriation of all Afghan nationals residing illegally in Pakistan, emphasizing that no further extension would be granted for their stay.\nThe prime minister appreciated Pakistan’s decades-long hospitality towards millions of Afghan refugees despite enormous economic and security challenges, recalling that Pakistan had borne heavy losses in the war against terrorism both in lives and resources.\nHe noted that despite multiple diplomatic efforts, including high-level visits by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Defense Minister, and other senior officials to Kabul, Pakistan’s concerns regarding the use of Afghan soil by terrorist groups remained unresolved.\n“Pakistan’s brave people, who have sacrificed so much in the fight against terrorism, now rightly ask how long we can continue bearing the burden of Afghan refugees,” the prime minister remarked.\nThe forum was briefed that as of October 16, 2025, more than 1.47 million Afghan nationals had already been repatriated in a phased manner. Authorities informed that only those holding valid Pakistani visas would be allowed to stay, while the number of exit points on the border was being increased to facilitate a faster return process.\nThe prime minister instructed that the repatriation be carried out in a dignified and humane manner, particularly ensuring respect for the elderly, women, children, and members of minority communities. He warned that harboring or sheltering illegal Afghan residents, including allowing them to stay in guest houses, was a punishable offense under the law.\nPM Shehbaz Sharif also lauded the Pakistan Armed Forces under the leadership of Field Marshal Asim Munir for effectively repelling recent cross-border attacks from Afghanistan and reaffirmed that Pakistan’s armed forces have always proven their professional excellence in defending the homeland.\nThe meeting participants, including the Prime Minister of AJK and provincial leaders, appreciated Pakistan’s diplomatic achievements and praised the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Field Marshal Asim Munir in steering national policy on the issue.\nConcluding the session, the PM directed all provincial governments and institutions to fully implement the agreed recommendations and extend complete cooperation to ensure the timely and dignified repatriation of all illegal Afghan residents from Pakistan.\nThe meeting was attended by Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir, Chief of Army Staff, federal ministers, the Prime Minister of Azad Jammu and Kashmir, chief ministers of Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, and Gilgit-Baltistan, and the representative of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister, Muzzammil Aslam.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
