It reflects the UAE’s confidence in Pakistan’s financial sector and reform agenda, while paving the way for greater cooperation and investment between the two nations.\nEstablished in 1989, First Women Bank operates as a full-fledged commercial bank with a nationwide presence of 42 branches, offering a comprehensive range of retail, SME, and corporate banking services.\nIHC’s investment in Pakistan’s financial and banking sectors represents a significant milestone in its strategy to build and strengthen resilient financial institutions that support comprehensive growth strategies and enable the full expansion of business operations.\nFollowing the acquisition, IHC will ensure that the bank meets the Minimum Capital Requirement (MCR), strengthening its capital base and enabling expansion of operations and its footprint across Pakistan. The transformation strategy will focus on creating a modern AI-enabled financial institution by modernizing core banking infrastructure, automating processes, and integrating digital channels with advanced analytics and artificial intelligence to deliver faster, smarter, and more efficient services.\nA key component of this transformation will be investment in people, driving talent development, capacity building, and a performance-driven culture to empower teams and deliver innovative solutions at scale. The bank will also undergo a rebranding exercise, adopting a new name and identity to reflect its broader mandate to serve all segments of society and accelerate financial inclusion across the country.\nThe acquisition follows the landmark joint venture signed in February 2025 by International Resources Holding (IRH), another IHC subsidiary, with the government of Balochistan and local partners, further deepening UAE–Pakistan economic cooperation across key sectors. Together, these strategic initiatives reaffirm IHC’s long-term vision of fostering sustainable growth, advancing technology-driven transformation, and strengthening global economic connectivity.\nEstablished in 1999, IHC has become the most valuable holding company in the Middle East and one of the world’s largest investment firms, with a market capitalization of AED 881.6 billion (USD 239.9 billion).\nSince then, it has transformed to represent a new generation of investors. IHC’s commitment to sustainability, innovation, and economic diversification spans over 1,300 subsidiaries, driving growth across industries like asset management, healthcare, real estate, financial services, IT and more.\nIHC continually looks beyond the stand-alone value of its assets for opportunities, stepping outside of traditional approaches and artificial barriers to unlock opportunities across its portfolio, enabling sector-agnostic Dynamic Value Networks and creating results that are often much greater than the sum of their parts.",
