  "content": "ISLAMABAD, October 15 (APP): Saudi Arabia is set to host the World Championship in Fire and Rescue Sport for the first time in the Arab world, marking another milestone in the Kingdom’s emergence as a global hub for international sporting and professional events.\nThe tournament, organized by the General Directorate of Civil Defense in partnership with the International Sport Federation of Firefighters and Rescuers (ISFFR), will take place at Prince Faisal bin Fahd Sports City in Riyadh from October 26 to November 1, 2025. The Minister of Interior Prince Abdulaziz bin Saud bin Naif bin Abdulaziz will officially inaugurate the championship during its opening ceremony on October 28.\nThe event coincides with the centenary of the Civil Defense Directorate’s founding, adding symbolic significance to the Kingdom’s hosting of the competition.\nDirector General Maj. Gen. Dr. Hamoud bin Sulaiman Al-Faraj commended the interior minister’s patronage, emphasizing that the championship reinforces Saudi Arabia’s growing reputation as a global destination for major sporting events – an achievement aligned with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030.\nThe Riyadh championship will feature delegations from 22 countries and more than 300 competitors, who will take part in four main events – the 100-meter hurdles, 400-meter relay, ladder tower climb, and combat race. The contests are designed to test physical endurance, teamwork, and technical proficiency through realistic firefighting simulations.\nLaunched in 2002 in Moscow, the World Fire and Rescue Championship has evolved into a leading international competition blending athletic excellence with professional discipline. Over two decades, it has grown to include participants from more than 25 countries across Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America, with both men’s and women’s categories officially recognized.\nThe Riyadh 2025 edition, representing the 20th men’s and 11th women’s championships, underscores the Kingdom’s recognized capability to host complex, specialized global events. It will also highlight modern firefighting technologies, promote international cooperation among fire and rescue services, and uphold WADA anti-doping standards to ensure sporting integrity.\nThe tournament carries a profound humanitarian message celebrating firefighters’ heroism, professionalism, and selfless dedication to saving lives. Riyadh’s hosting reflects Saudi Arabia’s commitment to advancing safety awareness, enhancing national capabilities, and showcasing its leadership role in organizing high-profile international events.\n“This championship not only celebrates courage and teamwork,” said Maj. Gen. Al-Faraj, “but also reflects the Kingdom’s broader vision to promote community safety and international cooperation under the transformative framework of Vision 2030.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
