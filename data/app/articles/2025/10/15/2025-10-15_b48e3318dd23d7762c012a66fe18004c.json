The project includes extending the runway by 3,000 meters and widening it to 45 meters to accommodate larger aircraft.\nHe further shared that the Authority is considering two options for Sukkur — either constructing a new international airport or upgrading the existing one to meet international standards.\nResponding to public queries, the Deputy DG (Planning & Development) clarified that DG Khan and Hyderabad airports are fully operational, though final decisions regarding flight operations lie with the airlines, which determine routes based on commercial viability.\nSumair Saeed also emphasized the need to raise passenger awareness regarding their right to compensation in cases of flight delays or cancellations.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
