The project, expected to be completed within six weeks, will improve health conditions and enhance the learning environment for young girls, she added.\n“Clean water and education are the foundations of sustainable development,” the TIKA country coordinator said adding, “By investing in both, we are investing in a healthier, more equitable future.”\nSaliha remarked that TIKA’s initiatives continue to reflect Turkiye’s commitment to human-centered development, fostering resilience and opportunity for communities particularly women and youth across Pakistan and beyond.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
