Tarar added that President Asif Ali Zardari had taken cognizance of the issue, while Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and PML-N chief Nawaz Sharif were committed to reconciliation.\nHe said the recent deluge was a natural calamity, while climate change remained a global challenge — one in which Pakistan had no direct role, yet continued to suffer its devastating consequences.\nThe Punjab government had allocated a substantial amount to compensate victims affected by flooding in three major rivers, he added.",
