Visitors will have a chance to experience Balochistan’s cultural tourism, food tourism, eco and coastal tourism, medical and adventure tourism, as well as archaeological treasures that reflect its ancient heritage.\nA highlight of the festival will be dramatic performances of Baloch folk tales, including the timeless romantic story of Hani and Sheh Mureed and the soulful poetry of Mast Tawakali. These presentations will blend storytelling, music, and performance art — bringing to life the emotional depth and wisdom of Baloch folklore.\nEqually enticing will be the Balochi food stalls, offering traditional dishes that have become a favorite among Islamabad’s food lovers. From aromatic Sajji to spiced Kaak bread and dates from Turbat, the culinary segment will celebrate the authenticity of Baloch flavors.\nThe festival’s atmosphere will be further enriched by performances from legendary Balochi singers and folk musicians, who will fill the air with the rhythm of dambura, suroz, and soulful melodies reflecting the essence of desert and sea.\nDiplomats, members of the international community, media, and locals are expected to attend the event.\nAccording to the organizers, the festival aims to project a positive and inclusive image of Balochistan, countering stereotypes and highlighting its potential as a hub for tourism, investment, and cultural exchange.\nAs Dawood Tareen puts it, “Balochistan is not just a land of vast mountains and deserts but it is a land of stories, songs, flavors, and traditions that deserve to be celebrated. This festival is our way of inviting the world to see the real Balochistan-peaceful, welcoming, and full of life.”\nThe Balochistan Grand Tourism Festival 2025 thus stands as a powerful reminder that beyond the headlines, there is a province waiting to be discovered where culture meets nature, and tradition meets tomorrow.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
