This program will end in two years. But if entrepreneurs from both Pakistan and Malaysia step forward, commit to joint ventures, and build lasting business relationships, I believe we can say goodbye to the IMF forever,” the prime minister added.\nPrime Minister Anwar Ibrahim on the occasion stressed the need to foster collaboration under ASEAN, noting that expanding the grouping’s economic footprint would benefit the entire region.\nHe assured Pakistani entrepreneurs of his government’s support in facilitating smoother business processes and regulatory cooperation.\nHe also uttered a few few words in Urdu that was warmly applauded by the audience, further highlighting the warmth between the two nations.\nPM Shehbaz said as the fifth-largest producer of cotton and milk, and the fourth-largest mango producer globally, Pakistan offered immense potential for value-added agricultural exports. “Our mangoes are among the best in taste worldwide. With Malaysian expertise, we can build SME-based processing units for off-season packaging, value addition, and export.”\nHe said Pakistan will export $200 million worth of Halal meat to Malaysia assuring to compete on price, quality, and shipment commitments.\nHighlighting the vast mineral potential of Pakistan, he pointed to the Rekodek copper and gold mine in Balochistan as a major opportunity for joint investment, especially in the context of the global energy transition.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan had also vast potential of tourism as the country’s northern areas Gilgit, Baltistan, Hunza, Nanga Parbat, and K2 and many other areas offered world-class destinations. “With Malaysian tourism expertise, we can transform these regions into major international tourist attractions,” he said.\nHe also proposed leveraging the country’s young and skilled labor force to support Malaysian industries, where rising labor costs had become a concern. The prime minister pointed out that Pakistan also offered cost-effective skilled labor, and by combining investment portfolios, both sides could establish joint production units that export to Gulf countries, Central Asia, and beyond.\nAs regards the government’s performance on the economic front, the prime minister noted that Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators were showing encouraging results. Inflation has dropped from 36% to single digits, and policy rates have decreased from 22.5% to 11%, he said.\nThe prime minister emphasized that combined efforts could unlock new horizons in trade, investment, and industrial collaboration.",
