  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 19 (APP): Surrounded by traffic and trapped in a sea of concrete, communities living along the Islamabad Expressway, from Faizabad to Khanna Pul, are raising a simple yet urgent demand: turn the long-unused greenbelt into a safe, accessible public space.\\n\\nOriginally meant as a natural buffer, this strip has become a symbol of neglect — overgrown, littered, and forgotten. Yet residents believe it holds the potential to be a lifeline: a place for walking tracks, children’s play areas, and greenery that supports both physical and mental well-being in a city rapidly losing its breathing spaces.\\n\\nOn a battered bench between the noisy Expressway and the streets of Iqbal Town, Salma from Shakrial sits with her two children. Their two-room home is dark and damp, so she brings them out for fresh air.\\n\\n“My children are like flowers. Without fresh air and the morning dew, they are withering away,” she says softly talking to APP.\\n\\nThe children laugh as they slide down the only working slide — until their play is interrupted. A taped tennis ball, hit hard by older boys playing cricket, strikes seven-year-old Zainab.\\n\\nThis single ruined patch is all they have. Women, toddlers, and boys share it — playing, sitting in the dust, dodging cricket balls. People throw garbage here too, making it dirty and unsafe.\\n\\nEhsan, who came at his daughter Aqsa’s request, told APP:\\n\\n“The parking mafia and building material dealers are taking over this place too. Even this little space is shrinking for us. When I take my daughter back home, she will be covered in dust.”\\n\\n“We have no other place to bring our kids on weekends. From Faizabad to Khanna Pul there is a wide strip of land. If it were leveled and grass planted, families could spend a few peaceful hours.”\\n\\nBashira Bibi, her cheeks red from the sun, says:\\n\\n“Only two slides remain. The swings and benches are broken or stolen. If someone damages anything, nobody stops them.”\\n\\n“There are holes everywhere, dust and stones all around. Three or four cricket teams play at once, and their balls keep hitting us. But we have no choice?” he told APP,.\\n\\n“We tried to improve the space with local effort. A few swings were installed, but without money for a boundary wall or proper equipment, nothing lasted. Now this wide strip from Faizabad to Khanna Pul is being grabbed by mafia or turned into graveyards. With just a little attention, this could become a safe space for thousands of residents.”\\n\\n“We know women and children are disturbed by our cricket balls, but tell us where else can we go? Artificial turf grounds in the city charge by the hour. We cannot afford them.”\\n\\n“The space is here. If a portion was set aside for us, we could play in peace.”\\n\\nOld Jamila Bibi, walking with a stick, says:\\n\\n“I spent my life in open fields in the village. Now I come here hoping for fresh air, but the dust and the cricket balls push me to the edge. If there was grass, I could sit in comfort even for a while.”\\n\\nOn the Islamabad side — from Dhoke Kala Khan to Zia Mosque — the need is the same. Sitting on a patch of wild grass near the mosque, Asim says:\\n\\n“We have no park or open ground. Our cramped homes force us to sit here among pits and garbage.”\\n\\nThis long, wasted greenbelt — touching Iqbal Town, Murshid Town, Khanna Kak, Shakrial, Madina Town, Aliabad, Raja Shafiq-ur-Rehman Town in Rawalpindi, and the Zia Mosque strip in Islamabad — could become a true lifeline. Instead, it remains a dusty wasteland where families search for peace among broken swings, flying cricket balls, and garbage heaps.\\n\\nHealth and Relief: Parks improve air quality, reduce dust and heat, and offer space to walk, sit, and breathe.\\n\\nFor Children and Families: Kids need space to play. Women and elders need safe, calm places to relax. Without these, crowded homes become suffocating.\\n\\nGlobal Standards: The WHO recommends at least 9 m² of green space per person.\\n\\nLocal Reality: In Pakistani cities, green space falls far below this. Experts suggest 20–25% of urban land should be green — yet many Rawalpindi neighborhoods have none, even where land lies idle.\\n\\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
