  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 05 (APP): Sky gazers are in for a celestial treat as the first Supermoon of 2025 will light up the night sky on October 7.\nThe spectacular event will occur at 8:47 p.m. PST, when the Moon reaches its closest point to Earth in its elliptical orbit, appearing noticeably larger and brighter than usual.\nA Supermoon appears up to 14% larger and nearly 30% brighter than a typical full moon. On October 7, the Moon will be at a distance of 224,599 miles from Earth, making it about 6.6% larger and 13% brighter than an average full moon.\nAccording to the SUPARCO, the October Supermoon will rise in the east shortly after sunset and set in the west before dawn, providing several hours of viewing opportunity.\nThis year’s brightest Supermoon, however, is expected in November when the Moon will be 221,817 miles away from Earth.\nThe phenomenon will be visible across the world, including in Pakistan, promising a breathtaking night sky for observers and photographers alike. Adding to the visual delight, the planet Saturn will appear close to the Moon, visible to the west (left) on the evenings of October 06 and 07.\nFollowing this event, two more Supermoons will adorn the skies on November 05 and December 05, marking a memorable end to the year for astronomy enthusiasts.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
