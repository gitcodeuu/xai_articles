  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 05 (APP):Residents of various sectors of the federal capital have demanded intensified efforts to tackle the rising number of stray dogs in the city.\nCitizens report that several areas — including sectors G-6, G-10, I-8, F-11, and surrounding localities — are witnessing increased activity of stray dogs, often moving in aggressive packs.\nMultiple dog bite cases have been reported, with children and elderly residents being the most vulnerable.\n“This is not just a matter of nuisance — it’s a public safety emergency. Authorities must act swiftly to implement humane and effective population control measures, ensure vaccination of stray animals, and protect residents from further harm,” said Dr. Riaz Naru, a resident of G-6/4, who was bitten by a stray dog near Qutub Shaheed Masjid on Street 55.\nResidents have urged the CDA, Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation (IMC), and district health authorities to take immediate and coordinated action.\nThey emphasized that mass sterilization, vaccination drives, and the creation of designated shelters are essential to address the issue in line with public health priorities and animal welfare standards.\nMeanwhile, a CDA official said that the Municipal Corporation Islamabad (MCI) and CDA have intensified efforts to address and prevent the rising number of complaints regarding stray dogs in the federal capital.\nJoint teams from CDA and MCI are actively conducting operations, and the registration and resolution process for public complaints has been expedited. Citizens can register complaints through the 24/7 operational helpline 1334, which caters to both urban and rural areas of Islamabad.\nImproved arrangements have also been made at the Stray Dog Centre located in Tarmri, where the Trap, Neuter, Vaccinate, and Release (TNVR) method is being implemented. Under this method, stray dogs are captured, neutered, vaccinated, and relocated to safe areas.\nAccording to CDA records, between July and September 2025, action was taken on hundreds of reported cases from various markets, residential sectors, and rural localities. Areas covered include sectors G-14, D-12, F-6, F-7, I-9, I-10, G-10, F-11, and neighborhoods such as Saidpur, Margalla Town, Bhara Kahu, and the Red Zone.\nDuring this period, over 550 stray dogs were relocated to the Stray Dog Centre.\nThe MCI administration stated that all complaints are being addressed promptly and that the Stray Dog Centre is fully operational. Citizens can lodge complaints through the 1334 helpline or the DC Office Portal for immediate action regarding stray dogs.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
