  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 22 (APP): The Standing Committee on Information Technology and Telecommunication was informed on Wednesday that the Islamabad IT Park project was expected to be completed within its revised timeline of December 31, 2025.\n\nThe meeting was chaired by Syed Amin ul Haq. While reviewing the progress of the Islamabad IT Park, the Committee observed that the project was initially scheduled for completion by October 31, 2025; however, only 80 percent of the work has been completed so far.\n\nThe Ministry informed the Committee that the delay occurred due to changes in the contractor and consultant from Korea, which significantly affected the project’s pace and caused delays.\n\nIt was further conveyed that the Prime Minister had issued clear directions to ensure the project’s completion within the current year.\n\nThe Committee also directed the Ministry to launch development projects in smaller cities to promote industrialization and economic growth across the country.\n\nIn response, the Ministry briefed that Special Technology Parks are being established in smaller cities through the private sector, under which interest-free loans are being provided to support such initiatives.\n\nThese projects aimed to facilitate entrepreneurs and local investors while promoting technology-based industries in underdeveloped regions.\n\nThe Committee decided to defer “The Prevention of Obscenity and Indecency in Digital Media Bill, 2025” to the next meeting, as the mover of the Bill was not present. It was agreed that the Bill would be taken up in the upcoming session.\n\nMeanwhile, the Sub-Committee, constituted under the convenorship of Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti, presented its report to the Committee.\n\nThe Committee expressed satisfaction over the report and endorsed its recommendations, directing the Ministry to ensure their strict implementation in letter and spirit.",
