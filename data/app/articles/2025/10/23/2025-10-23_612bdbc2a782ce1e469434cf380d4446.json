  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 22 (APP):Pakistan Academy of Letters (PAL) hosted an informal session of its weekly literary series “Chai, Baatain aur Kitaabain” here on Wednesday.\n\nThe event was organized under the leadership of the Academy’s Executive Director and Editor-in-Chief, Muhammad Asim Butt.\n\nThe session witnessed enthusiastic participation from writers, poets, and intellectuals from Rawalpindi and Islamabad, all of whom share a deep connection with the Pothohari language.\n\nSpeakers discussed the literary and aesthetic dimensions of Pothohari poetry and prose, emphasizing that Pothohari literature not only reflects the rich cultural heritage of the Pothohar region but also serves as a vital medium for transmitting local traditions and values to younger generations.\n\nA special tribute was paid to renowned writer Aziz Malik. According to the speakers, he was held in such high regard that even the prominent Urdu literary figure Mumtaz Mufti used to share his prose works with him. This, they said, highlights the significant influence Pothohari writers have had on Urdu literature as well.\n\nParticipants also shed light on the historical and geographical significance of the Pothohar region. They noted that although the area has long served as a corridor for various conquerors, its people have preserved their unique culture, language, and traditions through creativity and resilience.\n\nSpeakers called for institutional efforts to safeguard the literary heritage of the Pothohari language. Toward the end of the session, poets presented their work in Pothohari, which was warmly received by the audience, adding vibrancy to the literary gathering.\n\nDuring the event, participants collectively requested Muhammad Asim Butt to convey their appeal to the Chairperson of the Academy, Dr. Najeeba Arif. The request included a proposal to establish a dedicated section in the Academy’s library for books written in Pothohari, to ensure the systematic preservation of the language’s literary treasures. They also urged the Academy to initiate a formal award to recognize outstanding writers and poets contributing to Pothohari literature.\n\nNotable attendees of the session included Asim Butt, Shamsa Noreen, Sharif Shad, Farzand Ali Hashmi, Fareed Zahid, Zaheer Chaudhry, Iqbal Hussain Afkaar, Saadia Batool Pirzada, Akhtar Usman, Hayat Swati, Sardar Yousafzai, Sabeen Younas, Khair-un-Nisa Khairi, Jameel Mughal, Dr. Amir Zaheer Bhatti, Atta Sheikh, Muneer Fayyaz, and Ehsan Baloch.\n\nThe session concluded with an expression of appreciation for PAL’s continued efforts to foster dialogue, celebrate regional languages, and promote literary diversity across Pakistan.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
