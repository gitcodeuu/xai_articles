  "content": "HYDERABAD, Oct 21 (APP):Leading agricultural scientists have raised serious concerns over the steep decline in cotton cultivation across Pakistan, particularly in Sindh, warning that a combination of climate change, shrinking water resources and unsustainable farming practices has slashed national cotton yields by nearly 50% over the past 15 years.\\n\\nSpeaking at the “Cotton Mela 2025”, organized by the Centre of Agriculture and Biosciences International (CABI) at the Business Incubation Centre of Sindh Agriculture University (SAU), Tandojam, experts called for urgent and coordinated research, innovation and policy reforms to protect and revive Pakistan’s most vital cash crop.\\n\\nVice Chancellor of Sindh Agriculture University Prof. Engr. Dr. Altaf Ali Siyal said the country’s cotton output had been on a continuous decline due to multiple interlinked challenges including climate change, dwindling irrigation supplies, middlemen exploitation, unfair pricing mechanisms, rising input costs and declining export quality. “Traditional cotton belts such as Multan, Ghotki and Sanghar are now shifting to sugarcane and rice, a deeply alarming trend that threatens the agricultural balance and economic sustainability of Pakistan,” Dr. Siyal warned.\\n\\nHe emphasized that the development of climate-tolerant varieties, modern research and institutional cooperation had become indispensable for the conservation and restoration of cotton.\\n\\nProject Manager of CABI Dr. Hebatullah Asad said that Pakistan’s overall cotton production has declined by more than half over the past fifteen years, which was an alarming sign for the country’s agricultural economy. He added that around 65 percent of toxic chemicals and pesticides were being used in cotton cultivation, contributing to environmental pollution and increasing health-related risks.\\n\\n“CABI has trained over 30,000 farmers in natural and sustainable pest management practices to reduce chemical dependency and ensure long-term crop resilience,” he added.\\n\\nCoordinator of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Sindh Office Dr. Ashfaq Ahmed Nahiyoon stressed the need to restructure Pakistan’s cotton supply chain, from seed to market and export to restore the crop’s competitiveness.\\n\\nHe further mentioned that FAO was implementing several projects across Sindh to enhance farmer capacity building, rural women’s economic participation and food security resilience amid climate pressures.\\n\\nJuma Khan Bajkani from the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council (PARC) shared recent figures showing that Pakistan recorded its lowest cotton yield in 2024–25, with Sanghar and Ghotki districts among the hardest hit. He urged immediate technical assistance, research interventions and policy attention to restore productivity in the country’s cotton belt.\\n\\nThe event also featured a cotton-themed agricultural and cultural exhibition, showcasing innovations and products from Sindh Agriculture University, CABI, public institutions and private sector partners.\\n\\nIn the concluding session, Vice Chancellor Dr. Altaf Ali Siyal distributed souvenirs and shields among participants, experts and institutional representatives, acknowledging their efforts in promoting cotton research and sustainability.\\n\\nThe event was attended by Dean of the Faculty of Crop Protection and CABI Focal Person Dr. Abdul Mubeen Lodhi, Professor Dr. Aijaz Ahmed Soomro, Chairperson of the Women Chamber of Commerce Shahida Talpur, Kamran Shoaib from Gul Ahmed Group, Reshma Thebo, Abdullah Keryo, Zohaib Khanzada, Rafique Ahmed Jamali as well as a large number of teachers, agricultural experts, farmers and students.\\n\\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
