She will collaborate with UN Women to raise awareness, inspire collective action, and amplify the voices of those often unheard, particularly in areas related to women’s economic empowerment, leadership, digital inclusion, and the prevention of gender-based violence.\nHania Aamir succeeds Muniba Mazari, who held the honorary position until August 2025 and continues to be an influential global advocate for women’s rights, inclusion, and social justice.\nExpressing her gratitude and sense of duty, Hania Aamir remarked:\n“I am deeply honored to be designated as UN Women’s National Goodwill Ambassador for Pakistan. This is more than just a title — it is a commitment to speak up for women and girls whose voices deserve to be heard. I hope to contribute meaningfully by championing equality, promoting empowerment, and helping create opportunities where every woman and girl can shape her own future with confidence and dignity.”\nWelcoming her appointment, Jamshed M. Kazi, Country Representative of UN Women Pakistan, highlighted the significance of this milestone:\n“Hania’s appointment comes at a pivotal time as we commemorate 30 years of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action — a landmark global agenda for women’s rights and gender equality. Her passion, creativity, and strong connection with Pakistan’s youth make her an ideal advocate to carry forward UN Women’s mission. We look forward to working closely with her to turn awareness into concrete action and transformative change for women and girls across Pakistan.”\nAs National Goodwill Ambassador, Hania Aamir will take part in UN Women-led campaigns and initiatives aimed at strengthening women’s participation in the economy, leadership roles, and digital innovation. She will also support advocacy efforts addressing climate resilience, education access, and protection from gender-based violence, reinforcing her commitment to a more equitable and inclusive society.\nUN Women is the United Nations organization dedicated to gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. The organization works in partnership with governments, civil society, and communities to advance women’s rights, shape inclusive policies, and create systemic change for a fairer, more equal world.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
