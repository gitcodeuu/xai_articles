For example, UN Women supports programs that empower women and youth, both key players in achieving food security.”\nOkoth said empowering women farmers and youth entrepreneurs can help drive productivity and innovation in agriculture. “Their participation strengthens the social and economic foundations of rural communities,” he added.\nAddressing Climate Challenges Through Early Action\nPakistan’s exposure to floods, droughts, and other natural disasters continues to threaten its agriculture sector. Okoth said FAO is supporting the government in anticipatory action and early warning systems to prepare for climate-related shocks.\n“For every dollar invested in preparedness, around eight dollars are saved in response costs,” he said. FAO is helping introduce climate-resilient farming techniques, strengthening recovery programs, and guiding the use of geo-spatial tools for appropriate land management.\nOkoth said that FAO collaborates with research institutions to develop adaptive crop varieties and livestock breeds suited for changing weather patterns. “Our focus is to bring global best practices and technologies to local communities\nto improve resilience,” he added.\nEmpowering Youth and Women in Agriculture\nFAO’s initiatives in Pakistan place strong emphasis on youth engagement and women’s empowerment. “The future of agriculture depends on young people and women,” Okoth said.\nHe noted that FAO is working to make agriculture more appealing and accessible. “Digital tools and mobile technology are transforming opportunities for rural women and youth,” he said. “Through e-commerce platforms, female farmers and artisans can now reach wider markets without leaving their communities.”\nHe added that the goal is to redefine agriculture as a profession of choice, offering dignity and innovation, rather than being seen as a last resort.\nFAO’s Future Vision for Pakistan\nAs FAO enters its next decade, Okoth said the organization is focusing on transforming the agri-food system as a whole rather than through isolated interventions. “Fragmented efforts have limited impact. We need an integrated approach that connects farmers, traders, processors, and consumers,” he said.\nUnder the UN Joint Programme on Agri-Food Systems, FAO, WFP, UNICEF, IFAD, and other agencies are collaborating to address food production, distribution, and nutrition-sensitive agriculture.\nOkoth also highlighted FAO’s focus on digitalization and data-driven decision-making to improve food safety and strengthen Pakistan’s position in global markets. “We aim to ensure that Pakistan’s agricultural exports meet international standards and remain competitive,” he said.\nWorld Food Day 2025: A Call for Collective Action\nOn the occasion of World Food Day 2025, Okoth reflected on the importance of shared responsibility. “This year’s theme, ‘Hand in Hand for Better Food and Better Future’, reflects FAO’s mission,” he said. “It reminds us that governments, UN agencies, and communities must work together to produce safe, sustainable, and nutritious food for everyone.”\nHe added that FAO’s 80-year journey is a reminder of how far global food systems have come — and how much more needs to be done to ensure food security and nutrition for all.\nAs FAO looks ahead, its focus in Pakistan remains clear: improving food systems, addressing climate challenges, empowering youth and women, and promoting sustainable agricultural growth.\n“World Food Day is not just a celebration,” Okoth said, “it is a reminder that food security is a shared goal, and collective action is the only way forward.”",
