He said that the young reciters and huffaz of the Qur’an were the spiritual ambassadors of Pakistan, who would spread the message of the Holy Book around the world.\nHe stated that the recitation of the Qur’an was not only about the beauty of voice but also about the purity of the soul. “Those who hifz the Qur’an are chosen servants of Allah,” he said, emphasizing that learning and teaching the Qur’an were among the most virtuous acts, as mentioned by the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him): “The best among you are those who learn the Qur’an and teach it.”\nSardar Yousaf extended his felicitations to both the winners and the participants who could not secure top positions, saying that all were worthy of appreciation for their dedication to the Qur’an.\nThe minister highlighted that the national competition, which has been held annually since 1981, aims to strengthen Qur’anic education and promote proper recitation and hifz among youth. The event also encourages students to understand and apply the teachings of the Qur’an in their lives.\nEarlier, the ceremony began with the recitation of the Qur’an and Naat.\nIn his speech, Sardar Yousaf said that reciting the Qur’an with focus and understanding brings peace to the heart and strengthens the connection between individuals and their Creator. “The Qur’an should be read with reflection, as its message guides us toward discipline, morality, and unity,” he added.\nSardar Yousaf praised the efforts of teachers, parents, and organizers who trained and supported the participants. He said that such initiatives play a vital role in building a generation that lives by the teachings of the Holy Qur’an.\n“The reciters and huffaz of the Qur’an are a blessing for the nation,” he remarked. “They remind us of the values that form the foundation of our faith and identity.”\nHe concluded the ceremony with a prayer for the success of all participants and for Pakistan’s continued progress as a nation guided by the principles of the Qur’an and Sunnah.\nThe event ended with the distribution of prizes among the winners, as the audience applauded the young participants for their remarkable commitment to learning Holy Qur’an.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
