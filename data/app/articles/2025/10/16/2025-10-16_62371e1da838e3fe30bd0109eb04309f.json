  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP):Chairman Senate Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani Thursday underlined the need for joint efforts to create awareness and educate the masses about breast cancer, as the disease still continues to pose a threat to women’s population of the country.\nHe expressed his views while addressing a seminar on breast cancer awareness jointly organized by Maroof International Hospital and the Islamabad Marriott Hotel.\nThe event aimed to promote early detection, education, and community engagement in the fight against breast cancer.\nIn his keynote address, Chairman Senate Gilani commended Maroof International Hospital and Islamabad Marriott Hotel for their collaborative efforts in raising awareness about breast cancer, stating that such partnerships between the public and private sectors were vital for advancing preventive healthcare and saving lives.\nHighlighting the significance of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, Chairman Senate Gilani said that October is not merely a symbolic period marked by pink ribbons and public campaigns, but a time for renewed commitment and education about a disease that continues to claim too many lives.\nHe expressed concern over the growing prevalence of breast cancer among women in Pakistan and the challenges of delayed diagnosis due to social stigma and lack of awareness. “Behind every number is a mother, a sister, a daughter — someone whose dreams and potential are cut short by this devastating disease,” he remarked.\nGilani stressed the need for integrating mental health support into cancer care, underscoring that psychological counselling and support groups must be accessible from diagnosis through recovery. “Healing the mind is as integral to healing the body,” he said.\nHe also apprised the medical community of the recent passage of the National Institutes of Health (Reorganisation) Amendment Act 2025, which mandates the establishment of a national cancer patient registry at the National Institute of Health.\nThis initiative, he said, will provide vital data to help policymakers design evidence-based cancer prevention and control strategies nationwide.\n“The Parliament stands ready to support all initiatives that promote women’s health, early cancer detection, and access to quality healthcare for all, regardless of background or income,” he affirmed.\nRecalling his tenure as Prime Minister, Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani said he had consistently championed health awareness and access to care, recognizing that a nation’s progress rests upon the health and empowerment of its women. “When a woman remains untreated or unheard, it is not just a personal tragedy; it is a loss for society as a whole,” he emphasized.\nGilani paid tribute to the courage of those battling breast cancer and mental health challenges, urging collective compassion and commitment.\n“Together, through awareness, empathy, and coordinated action, we can turn the tide against breast cancer and the stigma surrounding mental health,” he said.\nThe Chairman Senate encouraged the breast cancer survivor Aliya Agha and proposed that she should be declared goodwill ambassador for the pink ribbon and breast cancer awareness.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
