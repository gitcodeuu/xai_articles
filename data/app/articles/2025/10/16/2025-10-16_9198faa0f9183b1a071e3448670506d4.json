  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): The Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) has rejected recent unverified reports and social media claims predicting an extremely cold winter across Pakistan, terming them scientifically baseless and inconsistent with official climate assessments.\nIn an official statement issued on Thursday, the PMD clarified that its Seasonal Winter Forecast (December–February), derived from regional and global climate prediction models verified under World Meteorological Organization (WMO)-supported systems, indicates near-normal to slightly below-normal rainfall and slightly above-normal temperatures for most parts of the country.\nWhile localized cold spells may occur due to passing western disturbances, the department stated that no evidence supports predictions of an exceptionally severe or record-breaking winter.\nAccording to the PMD, current atmospheric analyses show the presence of a weak to moderate La Nina phase over the equatorial Pacific Ocean. Historically, La Nina conditions tend to reduce the intensity and frequency of winter weather systems over South and Southwest Asia, including Pakistan—resulting in fewer western disturbances, less rainfall and snowfall, and milder temperatures in many regions.\nPMD urged the public and media to rely solely on its official forecasts and verified communication channels, cautioning that spreading false or exaggerated weather claims can cause unnecessary fear and confusion.\nReaffirming its commitment to scientifically accurate and evidence-based forecasting, PMD emphasized that all its predictions align with WMO standards to ensure the safety and socioeconomic well-being of the nation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
