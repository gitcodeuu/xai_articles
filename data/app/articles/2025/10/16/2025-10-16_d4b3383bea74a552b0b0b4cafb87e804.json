Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary, Coordinator General, OIC-COMSTECH, delivered the welcome remarks, while the proceedings were conducted by Mr. Muhammad Murtaza Noor, Focal Person/Coordinator, CCoE, Outreach & Media, OIC-COMSTECH.\nIn his address, Prof. Dr. M. Iqbal Choudhary said the forum aims to develop a comprehensive roadmap for the rehabilitation and restructuring of Gaza’s higher education institutions. “The systematic destruction of universities, research centres, and schools in Gaza has deeply affected the intellectual and developmental foundations of an entire generation,” he stated. “Through joint academic planning, knowledge transfer, and institutional support, OIC-COMSTECH and partner universities aim to restore academic life and reignite the flame of learning and innovation that no war can extinguish.”\nProf. Dr M.F. Ayman Sobh, President of Al-Aqsa University Gaza, expressed heartfelt gratitude to OIC-COMSTECH and the Government of Pakistan for their support and solidarity. “This forum gives us renewed hope to rebuild our academic institutions and create new opportunities for our students and researchers,” he said, noting that collaboration with Pakistan would help revive laboratories, research infrastructure, and academic programs in Gaza.\nThe seven-member Palestinian delegation, comprising presidents, rectors, and senior academic leaders from Gaza, is on a week-long visit to Pakistan, facilitated by OIC-COMSTECH. The delegation will visit leading universities in Islamabad, Faisalabad, and Lahore to explore avenues of academic collaboration and partnership with Pakistani institutions.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
