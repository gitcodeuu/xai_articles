  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): In a decisive move to reduce youth unemployment and foster entrepreneurship, the government has further expanded the Prime Minister’s Youth Loan Scheme (PMYLS) under the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme (PMYP).\nThe initiative provides interest-free and low-interest business loans to young entrepreneurs and professionals across Pakistan through public-private partnerships with leading commercial banks. The scheme is being implemented nationwide  and was relaunched earlier this year to empower youth, promote financial inclusion, and stimulate small business growth.\nChairman Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan has been at the forefront of these efforts, leading multiple loan distribution events across the country to ensure fair and transparent delivery of funds. “We are not just issuing cheques we are investing in a future built by our youth,” he said in an exclusive interview with APP. “Our mission is to transform dreams into sustainable enterprises that create jobs and drive national growth.”\nIn recent weeks, hundreds of loans from PMYLS plateform have been distributed to young beneficiaries in Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, and Peshawar. Rana Mashhood met with start-up founders, artisans, and skilled graduates. At the Lahore Youth Business Expo, he personally handed over loan certificates to 250 young entrepreneurs, encouraging them to innovate and become role models for others.\nDuring a loan disbursement ceremony in Islamabad, he emphasized that the PMYLS represents the government’s firm belief in the creative power of youth. “Every rupee invested in our youth is an investment in Pakistan’s economic strength,” he noted, while addressing a packed audience of students, small business owners, and media representatives.\nAt another event in Karachi, Rana Mashhood announced the expansion of partnerships with private banks to accelerate processing times and reach underprivileged applicants. “We are taking this scheme to every district from Gwadar to Gilgit  so that no young Pakistani is left behind,” he stated.\nUnder the PMYLS, financing from PKR 0.5 million to PKR 7.5 million is offered across three tiers, carrying minimal interest rates between 0 and 7 percent.\nApplicants from all provinces, including Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir, are eligible. Priority is given to youth-led start ups in technology, agriculture, renewable energy, tourism, manufacturing, and creative industries.\nTo apply, interested individuals can visit the official PMYP Loan Portal (www.pmyp.gov.pk), where they can fill out an online application, upload their CNIC, business proposal, and bank details. The portal allows applicants to track their application status in real time.\nApplicants must be Pakistani citizens aged between 21 and 45 years with a valid CNIC. For IT and e-commerce related businesses, the minimum age is 18 years with at least matric-level education or equivalent training. Special preference is given to women, differently-abled persons, and rural youth.\nThe scheme has already begun transforming lives across Pakistan. Sara Khan, a young entrepreneur from Islamabad, shared her experience with APP how her organic skincare brand expanded after receiving a Tier-1 loan. “Before this, I had the skills but no capital. This programme helped me launch my business and employ two more women from my area,” she said.\nAmmar Hussain, an IT graduate from Rawalpindi, developed a mobile delivery app through the scheme. “It feels empowering to earn through my own idea instead of waiting for a job,” he said.\nIn Punjab’s rural areas, Shahid Ali from Sargodha used the PMYLS to introduce solar powered irrigation pumps. “It’s reduced our costs and inspired other farmers to innovate,” he said.\nChairman PMYP emphasized that these success stories reflect the government’s broader vision of economic inclusion. “We are connecting entrepreneurs with the Digital Youth Hub, Skill for All, and Start-Up Pakistan platforms for sustainable growth,” he said.\nYoung applicants and mentors have lauded the government’s initiative, calling it “a national investment in Pakistan’s most valuable resource which is its youth.”\nBy blending financial support, mentorship, and digital access, the Prime Minister’s Youth Loan Scheme continues to stand as one of Pakistan’s most impactful initiatives which is  shaping a generation ready to build, lead, and transform the nation’s economy.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
