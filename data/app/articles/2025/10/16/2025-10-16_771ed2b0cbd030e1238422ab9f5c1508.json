  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): The suspended Assistant Professor, Islamabad Model Postgraduate College, H-8, Muhammad Akram, on Thursday sought his reinstatement in accordance with Islamabad High Court (IHC) directions, who was suspended earlier for three months over the allegation of violation of rules.\nAccording to a press release, last week, Justice Muhammad Asif of the IHC had issued a stay order on the notification issued by the Federal Directorate of Education on October 3, 2025, under which Professor Akram was suspended for three months.\nThe matter started when some students of the college staged a peaceful symbolic protest for a few minutes against the closure of BS programs, which took place only during the college break time in the college premises and did not disrupt any classes. Which was later linked to Akram, it added.\nAccording to his lawyer, suspension fell under the category of violation of the Civil Servants (Efficiency and Discipline) Rules 2020, as neither a formal inquiry was underway nor was there any concrete evidence.\n“While issuing the stay order, the court directed the parties to submit their paragraph-wise comments by the next hearing. Not reinstating his client despite a clear court order is a clear violation of court orders,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
