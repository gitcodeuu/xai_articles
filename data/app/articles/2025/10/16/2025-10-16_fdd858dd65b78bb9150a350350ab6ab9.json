Resultantly, 57% of such trained beneficiaries (76% women) are self-employed while 16% of trained individuals (29% women) are employed with others.\nA PPAF official told Wealth Pakistan that the PM’s Interest-Free Loan Programme stands as a strong example of inclusive and sustainable financial empowerment. Beyond the impressive statistics, the initiative demonstrates how targeted economic interventions can trigger long-term social transformation at the grassroots level, he said.\nHe said, by empowering women and small-scale entrepreneurs, the programme not only supports household incomes but also fosters community resilience, self-reliance and employment generation.\nHe believed that this initiative has set a new benchmark for public sector-driven microfinance, ensuring that even the most marginalised individuals can access credit without falling into debt traps. He said the repayment rate of over 97% reflects not just financial responsibility but also the trust and ownership developed among beneficiaries.\nThe official said the programme highlights how transparent mechanisms and community-based support can strengthen public confidence in government welfare schemes. Furthermore, the diversification of loan utilisation across productive sectors has enhanced rural economic activity and created value chains in regions previously neglected by commercial lenders.\nHe said with continuous focus on skills training and women’s participation, the programme is expected to build an ecosystem of inclusive growth where small entrepreneurs evolve into stable contributors to the national economy.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
