They highlighted the crucial role of early diagnosis in treatment success and stressed the life-saving potential of regular mammograms.\nAliya Agha, breast cancer survivor and CEO of Margalla Tribune, shared her personal journey. “If my journey encourages even one woman to seek early screening, then I’ve done something worthwhile.\nIn his closing remarks, CEO Haroon Naseer of Maroof International Hospital said, “Over 40,000 women lose their lives to breast cancer in Pakistan each year — most due to late diagnosis. That is a statistic we cannot accept. Awareness must be matched with access.”\nThe seminar concluded with a renewed sense of purpose among attendees, underscoring the urgent need for continuous education, accessible screening, and collective responsibility in the fight against breast cancer.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
