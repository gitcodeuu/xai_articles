  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Thursday said that the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) had committed vandalism and arson in the guise of protest which is not acceptable at any cost.\nAddressing the media, the minister questioned the TLP’s decision to resort to violence and property damage. “Does any organization have a right to come out on the street and damage public and private property when the whole world is celebrating peace in Gaza,” he asked.\nThe whole world witnessed the protests for peace in Palestine as thousands of people took to the streets in London, Italy and Australia in a peaceful manner, but in Pakistan, the TLP mobilized with guns, daggers and other ammunitions, said the minister who was flanked by Federal Minister for Interior Syed Mohsin Naqvi, State Minister for Interior Talal Chaudhry and Minister for Religious Affairs Sardar Muhammad Yousaf.\nAtta Tarar said the TLP’s conduct exposed an orchestrated plan to disrupt law and order.\nHighlighting the tragic loss of lives, the minister asked what was the fault of the inspector who got martyred because of their firing.\n“No religion or constitution allows the killing of police officials,” he said.\nThe minister said the TLP raised the slogans that demonstrate their love for the Holy Prophet (SAW), but their actions of killing the people negate the teachings of our Holy Prophet (SAW).\nThe minister said police officials also had families who prayed for their protection when they left their homes for discharge of official duties.\nHe cited the Jamat-e-Islami’s recent large-scale, yet peaceful, protests as an example of how citizens can exercise their constitutional right to protest. The constitution does not only grant the right to protest but also impose certain conditions for exercising this right.\nThe minister said it seemed that the TLP held the violent protests to impose their will because the Gaza peace is being celebrated worldwide.\nHe highlighted the government’s diplomatic efforts, stating that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif advocated for the Palestinians at every forum, including at a recent international gathering in Sharm el-Sheikh where Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas expressed gratitude to the PM and people of Pakistan for supporting Palestinian brothers and sisters in every way.\nTarar said the successful diplomatic efforts for peace were met with tears of joy from residents of Gaza, the West Bank, and Rafah as they celebrated the end of oppression.",
