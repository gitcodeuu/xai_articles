  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): Former Ameer Jamaat-e-Islami, Sirajul-ul-Haq, Thursday emphasized on religious values, ideological foundations and firm goals to transform Pakistan as a strong Islamic welfare state.\nAddressing a seminar titled “Stability of Pakistan and Ideological Challenges Facing the Youth” at the National Press Club, Sirajul Haq underscored the importance of youth training, quality leadership, and revival of the collective ideology of the Muslim Ummah, said a press released on Thursday.\nThe event was also addressed by Haroon Ali Gilani, Raja Majid Hussain, Bilal Kakar and other speakers. He said that leadership must draw inspiration from the guiding principles of Islam and Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\nSirajul Haq stated that Quaid-e-Azam vision was not monarchical like king Akbar but modeled on the governance system taken from Islamic values.\nHe said the vision of Quaid-e-Azam was also commendable because he presented a clear Islamic vision based on a system ensuring justice, minority rights, and socio-economic balance.\nHe pointed out contradictions in the country’s educational system and social training, noting that created mental and ideological confusion among youth.\nHe urged comprehensive training of youth based on the concepts of Ummah, justice, courage, and leadership to enable them to play a constructive role in national development.\nDiscussing global issues, Sirajul Haq cited the Palestinian resistance and emerging intellectual movements as examples of organized, educated leadership that inspire optimism for the future.\nSirajul Haq urged youth “not to complain but to light their own candle,” adding that collective small peaceful efforts could become a powerful tide of change.\nHe stressed that state institutions, educational curricula, and political leadership should jointly ensure transparency, opportunity, and justice for the younger generation to achieve national stability and progress.\nHe said Pakistan’s stability depends not only on economic resilience but also on ideological strength.\nThe new generation, he noted, faces threats like Western intellectual influence, moral decline, and digital misinformation.\nTo counter this, he emphasized the need to embed Pakistan’s ideology in education, promote ideological content on social media, and modernize the presentation of religious, moral and historical values.\n“When the youth reconnect with their faith, ideology, and sense of purpose,” Sirajul Haq said, “Pakistan will truly become a strong Islamic welfare state.”\nParticipants and organizers appreciated his ideas, agreeing that ideological training and youth leadership development are essential to preserve the country’s collective identity and ensure a secure future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
