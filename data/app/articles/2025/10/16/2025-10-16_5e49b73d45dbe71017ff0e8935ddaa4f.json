  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP):Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi on Thursday reaffirmed that Pakistan Railways will not leave an inch of its land to anyone, directing authorities concerned to further intensify the anti-encroachment campaign against land grabbers.\nChairing a meeting to review the overall performance of the Multan Division, the minister reiterated his policy of zero tolerance against encroachments and emphasized the Railways’ unwavering commitment to passenger facilitation.\n“We will not take an inch of anyone else’s land, but we will not leave an inch of railway land to anyone,” said the minister.\nAccording to the briefing, the train punctuality during the current fiscal year stood at 88 percent, compared to 86 percent during the same period last year.\nDespite disruptions caused by recent floods, the division’s overall performance remained satisfactory, said Divisional Superintendent (DS) Multan.\nThe division’s revenue increased by Rs. 77 million in the first quarter of the current fiscal year compared to the same period last year. Meanwhile, a vigorous campaign against ticketless travel generated Rs. 13.5 million in additional revenue.\nThe strict measures are also being enforced against theft and smuggling, in line with the Minister’s zero-tolerance directive. So far, 87.5 acres of railway land have been retrieved under the ongoing anti-encroachment drive, which the minister ordered to be pursued with even greater determination.\nBriefing the meeting, the DS informed that the solarization project in Multan Division is progressing successfully under the Minister’s direction. Fourteen stations, including the DS Office Multan, have been completely converted to solar energy, resulting in Rs. 30 million savings in electricity costs during the current fiscal year.\nThe staff rationalization process is also underway to ensure efficient utilization of resources, while pensions to retired employees are being paid timely and without delay.\nThe DS said that monthly open courts (Khuli Kachehris) are being held regularly to address passenger grievances and service issues.\nDirecting all divisional officers, Hanif Abbasi urged them to conduct regular inspections, interact with passengers and ensure zero negligence in service delivery.\nReaffirming Pakistan Railways’ resolve, the minister said that the organization remains fully committed to providing safe, reliable and comfortable travel facilities to passengers across the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
