A daily review meeting, chaired by Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad Irfan Nawaz Memon, evaluated the campaign’s field performance and overall progress.\nDuring the briefing, officials reported that 287,817 children had been administered polio drops so far. The total target for the campaign stands at 461,125 children, leaving thousands still to be vaccinated in the coming days.\nThe briefing further revealed that teams faced 15,841 refusal cases, all of which were addressed on the spot through effective community engagement and awareness efforts. The DC directed health teams to ensure complete coverage and to adopt stronger follow-up measures in areas where resistance persists.\n“Ensuring that every child receives polio drops is a collective responsibility,” said DC Irfan Nawaz Memon, emphasizing the importance of community participation. He commended the continuous efforts of vaccination teams and noted that the number of refusal cases had significantly declined due to their persistent outreach work.\nThe DC also instructed officials to strengthen awareness campaigns at the community level to encourage greater cooperation from parents and guardians. He highlighted that timely coordination among field teams and community leaders was essential for eliminating polio from the region.\nHealth officials reiterated their commitment to reaching every household and reaffirmed that no child would be left unvaccinated during the campaign. They also appreciated the cooperation of local residents and volunteers who supported the vaccination teams in door-to-door efforts.\nThe Islamabad administration continues to monitor field operations closely, with special attention to high-risk areas. Teams have been deployed across urban and rural zones, ensuring the inclusion of all children under five years of age.\nAs the drive enters its final phase, authorities aim to sustain the momentum built over the past four days. The administration remains focused on achieving full coverage and preventing any gaps that could hinder the eradication of polio in the capital.\nThrough coordinated efforts, public engagement, and consistent monitoring, Islamabad’s health department continues its campaign to secure a polio-free future for every child in the city.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
