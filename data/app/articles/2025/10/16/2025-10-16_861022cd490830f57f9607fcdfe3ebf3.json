He emphasized that the protection of fundamental rights represents the highest expression of justice, which strengthens the moral fabric of society.\nFederal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar, National Commission for Human Rights Chairperson Rabiya Javeri Agha, and Senator Farooq H. Naek also addressed the symposium, highlighting the need to uphold equality, tolerance, and inclusion as essential elements of Pakistan’s constitutional democracy.\nIn his concluding reflections, Former Chief Justice Tassaduq Hussain Jillani said the judiciary has a sacred constitutional duty to safeguard pluralism, equality, and the rule of law. He noted that a just and tolerant society is built when citizens and institutions alike honor these principles.\nThe symposium concluded with the adoption of a “Declaration on Interfaith Harmony and Fundamental Rights,” reaffirming Pakistan’s resolve to promote unity, mutual respect, and justice as the cornerstones of its governance and national identity.\nThe event was attended by judges of the Supreme Court and High Courts, members of the district judiciary, diplomats, representatives of the bar, civil society, and the media. The proceedings were live-streamed nationwide, enabling the judiciary and bar across Pakistan to benefit from the discussions and reflections shared during the event.",
