  "content": "ISLAMABAD, October 13 (APP):The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences has awarded the 2025 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to distinguished Saudi scientist Professor Omar Monees Yaghi, marking a monumental achievement for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Arab world.\nProfessor Yaghi received the prestigious honor for his groundbreaking work on Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), crystalline materials capable of storing gases such as hydrogen and carbon dioxide, and harvesting water from air, even in arid environments.\nHe shares the award with Australian scientist Richard Robson and Japanese researcher Susumu Kitagawa, who together pioneered the field of reticular (network) chemistry – a new scientific discipline that has revolutionized materials science, environmental chemistry, and energy technology.\nIn an official statement following the announcement, Professor Yaghi expressed deep pride in representing Saudi Arabia on the global scientific stage.\n“This success is the fruit of a scientific culture nurtured by the Kingdom’s wise leadership under King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman,” he said. “Through Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia has committed to advancing knowledge, innovation, and research to global standards. I dedicate this prize to the youth of Saudi Arabia as a source of inspiration to pursue science and discovery at the highest level.”\nBorn in Amman, Jordan, in 1965 to a Palestinian family, Professor Yaghi pursued his higher education in the United States, earning his Ph.D. in Chemistry from the University of Illinois. He currently serves as Professor of Chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley.\nWidely recognized as the founder of reticular chemistry, Yaghi has developed methods to construct complex structures from simple molecular components, enabling breakthroughs in clean energy, environmental protection, and smart materials.\nProfessor Yaghi’s Nobel triumph represents not only a personal victory but also a historic achievement for Saudi Arabia and the wider Arab world – a powerful testament to the Kingdom’s growing contribution to global science and innovation.\nHis achievement is seen as a symbol of Saudi Vision 2030’s success in fostering a world-class ecosystem for research, innovation, and education, propelling the nation toward a future defined by knowledge and technological excellence.\nThis Nobel Prize is more than a scientific honor. It is a reflection of Saudi Arabia’s transformation into a hub of innovation and a beacon of intellectual progress in the Arab world.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
