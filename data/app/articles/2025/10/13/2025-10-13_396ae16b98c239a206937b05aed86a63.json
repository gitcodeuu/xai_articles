  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP):From traditional home remedies to modern cosmetic shelves, alum stone known scientifically as potassium alum, has stood the test of time as a healing mineral. Herbalists, botanists, and researchers are now revisiting its uses to determine what ancient wisdom got right and where caution is still needed.\nUsed for centuries across South Asia and beyond, the translucent crystal is praised for its astringent, antiseptic, and deodorizing qualities. Today, it continues to be used to stop minor bleeding, soothe shaving cuts, treat mouth ulcers, tighten skin pores, and even as a natural deodorant. Its renewed popularity has prompted fresh discussions among medical experts about its safety and scientific credibility.\nAlum, or KAl (SO4)2·12H2O, is a naturally occurring hydrated double sulfate compound that found early use in dyeing, leather tanning, and water purification.\nIn homes, however, it earned a trusted place in the medicine cabinet. Many Pakistanis, particularly in rural areas, still wet the small stone and apply it to shaving cuts or pimples, relying on its instant tightening and disinfectant effect.\nHerbal practitioners say this simple mineral deserves recognition for its effectiveness  but they also urge responsible use.\nLocally, herbal experts in Islamabad echo similar sentiments. Hakim Abdul Ahad, who runs a traditional herbal medicine shop  known as Ahad  Pansar store  in E-11 Markaz, said alum stone has been part of Unani medicine for generations. “We use it for oral ulcers and minor bleeding because it dries and disinfects. But moderation is key , excess use can cause skin irritation,” he explained.\nBotanists, meanwhile, study alum’s chemical behavior beyond medicine. Linda Brewer, a soil scientist from Oregon State University, highlights  how aluminum sulfate as a compound related to alum  alters soil pH, influencing hydrangea in flower colors and soil chemistry. “It’s a powerful compound that works by changing acidity levels, but overuse can harm plants,” she notes. Similar caution applies in human applications, where concentration and exposure time determine whether alum acts as a healing agent or an irritant.\nScientific studies lend some credibility to these traditional practices. Laboratory tests have confirmed alum’s antiseptic, styptic, and mild antimicrobial properties. Researchers report that alum contracts tissue, controls minor bleeding, and prevents bacterial growth  the same principles that make it a reliable aftershave block or mouth ulcer rinse.\nHowever, medical reviewers caution that human clinical trials remain limited. The compound’s efficacy is proven in controlled lab conditions and animal studies, but its therapeutic effects in humans require more evidence. Experts stress that while alum can complement modern medicine, it should never replace professional treatment.\nPhysicians also warn about misuse and potential risks. Internal consumption or long term topical use on large skin areas can lead to aluminum absorption, which is unsafe in excess. Doctors recommend using only pharmaceutical grade alum and rinsing thoroughly after topical application.\nDr. Sarah Malik, a dermatologist at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), told APP “Alum is fine for occasional use  say, after shaving or for a mouth rinse  but people must avoid using it daily on the face or ingesting it. Aluminum compounds can cause irritation or toxicity if misused.”\nDespite these warnings, many people continue to rely on alum for practical everyday needs.\nRehana jabeen a housewife in Rawalpindi told APP that I keep it in my kitchen for purifying water and cleaning utensils as well.\nA Young man Hamza said” I use it after shaving to prevent infection”\n. Herbal shops and Pansar stores in Peshawar and Islamabad report steady sales, with customers calling it a “natural antibiotic.”\nSuch continued popularity shows that alum’s centuries-old reputation endures  though modern science now advises a balanced, informed approach. Experts across disciplines  from herbalists to botanists to physicians  agree on one thing: alum’s simplicity is its strength, but its power demands respect.\nIt is a versatile natural mineral that offers genuine astringent and antiseptic benefits when used carefully. However, it should not be seen as a cure-all, nor a substitute for medical treatment.\nAccording to Dr Mustafa Ahmed ,a botanist at NIRC  “Nature gives us wonderful medicines, but it’s our responsibility to use them wisely.”\nIn the end, alum stone stands as a rare example of ancient tradition meeting scientific insight , a reminder that while old remedies can hold truth, modern knowledge helps ensure their safe and effective use in everyday life.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
