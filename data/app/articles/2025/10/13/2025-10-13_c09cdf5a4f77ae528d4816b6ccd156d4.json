So far this year, 29 cases have been reported.\nMore than 400,000 trained polio workers have been mobilized across the country to reach every household and vaccinate children.\nThe campaign will continue from October 13 to 19 in most parts of the country, while in seven districts of South Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, it will be conducted from October 20 to 23.\nThis is the fourth national polio campaign of 2025, targeting over 23 million children in Punjab, 10.6 million in Sindh, 7.2 million in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, 2.6 million in Balochistan, 760,000 in Azad Jammu and Kashmir, 228,000 in Gilgit-Baltistan, and 460,000 in Islamabad.\nThe campaign comes at a crucial time as the country faces an uptick in polio virus transmission, with 29 children affected so far this year.\nRecent floods have damaged sanitation systems, displaced communities, and disrupted healthcare services, increasing the risk of virus spread.\nThe nationwide effort reflects the Government of Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to protecting every child and fulfilling national and global promises for a polio-free future.\nPrime Minister’s Focal Person on Polio Eradication, Ms. Ayesha Raza Farooq, stated, “While the overall presence of the virus has declined compared to last year, our mission is not yet complete.”\nShe said, “The risk of transmission remains high, especially after the recent floods. Protecting children from polio is our shared responsibility.”\nShe said, “I urge all parents to open their doors to polio workers and ensure that their children receive these life-saving drops.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
