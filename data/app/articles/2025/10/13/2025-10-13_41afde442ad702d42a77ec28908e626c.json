  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP):Chief Executive Officer of the Pakistan Housing Authority Foundation (PHA Foundation), Muhammad Shahid Hussain, has said that adopting prefabricated construction technology is essential for resolving Pakistan’s growing housing challenges in a sustainable and cost-effective manner.\nIn an exclusive interview with APP, he stated that Pakistan’s traditional construction practices—based on bricks, steel, and cement—are no longer sufficient to meet the country’s increasing housing demand. “The modern world has shifted towards prefabricated structures that offer faster, cheaper, and higher-quality housing solutions. If we follow this path, we can complete projects on a fast-track basis and reduce construction costs by up to 30 percent,” he emphasized.\nThe CEO highlighted that the PHA Foundation is fully utilizing its resources to ensure the timely completion of ongoing projects and delivery of facilities to allottees. “Our top priority is to complete public welfare projects with transparency and quality. To achieve this, we have introduced reforms at financial, administrative, and technical levels,” he noted.\nDiscussing recent progress, Muhammad Shahid Hussain said that longstanding issues related to the Kuri Road project, graveyard, and parks in Islamabad have been resolved, while the grey structure of all blocks of Sector I-12 is 95% complete. Arrival of lifts for these apartments has started and payment has been made to the contractor. As soon as the capital Development Authority completes the necessary infrastructure, such as roads/ electricity, and gas, possession of these apartments will be offered to the allottees. He added that possession in Sector I-16 began two years back upon payment of additional costs. lift units stuck at Karachi Port have been paid for and are being installed. “Today, we can proudly say that nearly 100 percent of allottees have been given possession,” he said.\nRegarding the PHA Peshawar Residencia project, he mentioned that although it was launched in 2019 but did not progress even to PC-1 approval, it has now entered the on-ground construction phase. “We held meetings with the KP government and the Commissioner, finalized the design, signed agreements, and construction work is now underway,” he added.\nResponding to a question, the CEO said that the PHA Officers Residencia Park Road Islamabad project includes a proposal to develop residential plots on additional greenbelt areas, though no final decision has been made yet.\nHe further stated that issues with contractors in the Kuchlak housing project have been resolved and other related matters will also be settled soon. “Our goal is to complete all under-construction projects on time and deliver what rightfully belongs to the people,” Shahid Hussain asserted.\nThe CEO revealed that new housing projects in Gilgit-Baltistan are under preparation, while in Islamabad, PHA Foundation is ready to launch mega housing projects if CDA provides land and basic facilities.\nHe also shared that PHA Foundation has introduced an online payment mode and a digital record management system, which has eliminated unintentional plot cancellations and significantly enhanced transparency.\nConcluding, Muhammad Shahid Hussain said his focus is on personally reviewing on-ground progress and ensuring practical implementation. “My greatest satisfaction comes when people’s problems are resolved, and we successfully deliver on our commitments. Public satisfaction is our true success,” he remarked.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
