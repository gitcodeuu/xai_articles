  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP):The closure of roads in the federal capital affected judicial activities at the Islamabad High Court (IHC) as majority of lawyers and litigants couldn’t reach court.\nThe proceedings of several pending cases were adjourned without hearing due to the situation. The cause list of the division bench of Justice Babar Sattar and Justice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan was cancelled, while the normal proceedings in other courts were also affected.\nAccording to a statement issued by the Islamabad High Court Bar Association, all the entrances to Islamabad are closed due to the protest of a religious party, due to which the access of esteemed lawyers to the courts has become extremely difficult.\nThe statement further said that the esteemed judges are requested not to issue any adverse order against the lawyers if they are unable to appear in their cases.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
