He emphasized that the three nations stood together with unwavering solidarity against all acts of aggression that threatened their sovereignty and stability.\nReferring to Pakistan’s recent confrontation at its borders, Speaker NA highlighted that the support extended by Türkiye and Azerbaijan went beyond diplomatic formalities, calling it “a profound manifestation of a shared destiny and collective resolve.” He reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for Azerbaijan’s complete territorial integrity and Türkiye’s just position on Northern Cyprus, terming it a moral duty rather than a policy choice.\nTouching upon regional and global injustices, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq condemned the ongoing genocide in Gaza and the systemic oppression in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, calling them “open wounds on the conscience of humanity.” He said these tragedies symbolized the normalization of state terrorism and the erosion of international norms.\nSpeaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq reiterated Pakistan’s steadfast support for the Palestinian cause, welcoming the recently concluded Gaza ceasefire as a “hopeful step toward the Two-State Solution,” while stressing the need for tangible actions to end decades of suffering.\nAddressing regional security challenges, he underlined that terrorism remained a shared menace that transcended borders. He noted that while Pakistan continued to champion peace, including through its recent strategic agreement with Saudi Arabia, it was imperative for all regional stakeholders, especially the Afghan government, to prevent their soil from being used for terrorism. He strongly condemned the recent unprovoked joint attack by Taliban and Indian-sponsored elements, which was effectively repelled by Pakistan’s armed forces.\nReaffirming Pakistan’s decades-long support to the Afghan people, he urged the Taliban-led regime to reciprocate with responsibility and gratitude by ensuring that Afghan territory is not used against Pakistan.\nHighlighting the existential threat of climate change, he called for a unified regional response. He cited the devastating floods in Pakistan, the wildfires in Türkiye, and water scarcity in Azerbaijan as stark reminders of shared vulnerability. He stressed the need for a regional model of cooperation focusing on disaster preparedness, renewable energy, and joint adaptation initiatives to ensure a sustainable future.\nSpeaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq said that the Islamabad Declaration, adopted at the conclusion of the conference, was not merely a document but “a blueprint for collective action.” The declaration reaffirms the three nations’ commitment to enhanced communication, coordinated action in times of crisis, and structured dialogue at political, diplomatic, military, and social levels.\nHe emphasized that the declaration also represented a united demand for a just and lasting peace in Palestine and Kashmir in line with the aspirations of their people and relevant UN resolutions.\nExpressing deep appreciation for the participation of the Speakers of Türkiye and Azerbaijan, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq lauded their “principled stands on Palestine and Jammu & Kashmir” and commended the sincere contributions of all delegates that made the conference a success.\nConcluding his address, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq extended heartfelt gratitude to the officers and staff of the National Assembly for their tireless efforts in organizing the event and reaffirmed that “Pakistan will always remain the second home for our brothers from Türkiye and Azerbaijan.”\nHe formally declared the conclusion of the Third Trilateral Speakers’ Meeting concluded, with a resounding affirmation: “Long Live Pakistan–Azerbaijan–Türkiye Brotherhood! Pakistan Zindabad!”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
