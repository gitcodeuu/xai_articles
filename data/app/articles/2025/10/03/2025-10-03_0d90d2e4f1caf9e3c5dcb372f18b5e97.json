  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 3 (APP): Minister of State for Education and Training, Wajiha Qamar, has said that skills and expertise are not merely tools for employment but serve as weapons for Pakistan’s dignity and instruments for economic growth.\nShe expressed these views while addressing the two-day Global Dialogue organized by NAVTTC.\nCommending NAVTTC Chairperson and event organizer, Gulmina Bilal Ahmad, the Minister said that her efforts have motivated international institutions to work towards aligning Pakistan’s technical and vocational sector with global standards.\n“This international dialogue has shown us that Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is no longer a secondary agenda—it is central to socio-economic development in today’s rapidly changing environment. The reality is clear: about 64% of our population is under the age of 30, yet less than 8% of our youth are formally enrolled in TVET programs. Each year, nearly 2 million young Pakistanis enter the labor market, but only a fraction of them possess industry-relevant skills. This mismatch is both our biggest challenge and our greatest opportunity,” she remarked.\nHighlighting the government’s priorities, she said, “The Prime Minister has given us a clear direction: skills must be aligned with the future of work. His emphasis on electric vehicles, agricultural technology, and the green economy reflects new frontiers of growth where Pakistan must be ready to compete. If our training system remains outdated, we risk leaving our youth behind. But if we safeguard and reform our TVET sector, Pakistan can become a regional hub for skilled workforce.”\nShe stressed that TVET curricula must be industry-driven and directly linked to employment opportunities to ensure sustainable economic development.\nAt the closing session, Head of the EU Delegation, Jeroen Willems, said that the role of Chairperson Gulmina Bilal was crucial in bringing together TVET practitioners, educators, policymakers, and government officials to this global dialogue.\n“This dialogue was supported by Germany and Europe, and it has yielded 24 recommendations of critical importance. With 3 million young Pakistanis entering the labor market each year, it is vital to equip them with skills that meet global standards,” he said.\nGerman Ambassador to Pakistan, Ina Lepel, emphasized that the recommendations developed during this dialogue are highly important for the growth of the TVET sector, industry, and development sector. She affirmed that Germany would continue its cooperation for the development of the TVET sector in Pakistan. The Ambassador praised the roles of the Minister of State, the Federal Minister of Education, and the NEVTTC Chairperson.\nChairperson Gulmina Bilal noted that industry practitioners, educators, policymakers, and all stakeholders had worked diligently to prepare recommendations that would play a key role in the sector’s advancement. “This was made possible only through the cooperation of all stakeholders and international partners. Our goal is to provide globally competitive skilled youth for Pakistan,” she said.\nIn his concluding remarks, the Executive Director of NAVTTC thanked all participants, emphasizing that the TVET sector is a guarantor of sustainable development and acknowledging the indispensable role of global partners.\nThe dialogue also recommended that Parliament legislate to clearly define the roles and responsibilities of federal and provincial governance bodies in order to ensure better coordination.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
