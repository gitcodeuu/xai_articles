Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, he added, had just returned from his foreign visit earlier in the day. Meanwhile, PML-N leader Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, though back in the country, was following medical advice.\n“The exchange of accusations and counter-accusations must stop, and I am hopeful that the situation will calm down. With Allah’s grace, we will succeed in putting things back on track,” he said.\nEarlier, PPP senior leader Naveed Qamar, along with party members, staged a walkout from the proceedings but later rejoined the session.",
