  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 03 (APP): The Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) on Friday issued a show cause notice to the President of Aga Khan University (AKU), Karachi, over non-compliance with the Commission’s earlier order for disclosing exam leak inquiry.\nThe show cause notice has been issued under Section 20 (1)(f) of the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017, seeking an explanation from the President of Aga Khan University, Karachi, to explain why proceedings may not be initiated against him under Section 20 (1)(f) of the Act.\nEarlier, the Pakistan Information Commission, vide order dated 11-08-2025, had ruled that Aga Khan University falls within the definition of a “public body” under the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017, and directed the institution to release details of an internal inquiry into a leaked examination paper held on August 6, 2023.\nThe decision was made after an appellant filed a request seeking certified copies of the investigation report, recommendations of the inquiry committee, names of committee members with their Terms of Reference (TORs), and details of AKU employees and outsiders allegedly involved in the paper leak.\nThe appellant also demanded to know what disciplinary and legal actions were taken against those implicated, whether any complaints were filed with law enforcement agencies, and what preventive measures were adopted to avoid future leaks.\nDespite being issued notices, no representative appeared on behalf of Aga Khan University during the hearing. The University, however, had submitted a written reply claiming that it does not qualify as a public body under Section 2(ix) of the RTI Act.\nThe appellant countered this by arguing that Aga Khan University was established under the Aga Khan University Order of 1983, amended in 2002, making it a statutory body corporate with perpetual succession, powers to hold property, and the ability to sue or be sued in its corporate name. He further pointed out that the University had been granted land by the Federal Government, was benefiting from government subsidies and tax exemptions, and operated under a licence issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.\nAfter reviewing the relevant documents and hearing arguments, the Commission concluded that under Section 2(ix)(d) of the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017, any statutory corporation or body established by the Federal Government qualifies as a public body. It noted that Aga Khan University, being established through a Presidential Order, falls within this definition.\nThe PIC also held that the requested information related to the paper leak inquiry did not fall under any exemption clauses of the law. “There is no legal justification for withholding this information,” the order stated. Accordingly, the Commission allowed the appeal and directed the President of Aga Khan University to furnish all requested documents and details to both the appellant and the Commission within ten days.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
