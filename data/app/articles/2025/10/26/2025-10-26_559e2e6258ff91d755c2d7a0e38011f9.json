The group comprises recent graduates and faculty members from the VM Centre for Traditional Arts, Karachi, alongside Muzammil H. Chandio, an alumnus of the National College of Arts, Lahore.\n\nTheir collective works explore the intersections of faith, craft, and aesthetics, reviving traditional Sindhi motifs while reinterpreting them through a modern artistic vocabulary.\n\nDrawing inspiration from Sindh’s artistic and spiritual legacy, the artists incorporate Ajrak patterns, rally designs, Makli architecture, and the sacred geometry of Thatta.\n\nThrough layered compositions, rhythmic forms, and symbolic motifs, the exhibition pays homage to Sindh’s timeless visual identity where geometry breathes, color speaks, and tradition endures. Each piece reflects the warmth of Sindhi hospitality and the continuing dialogue between craftsmanship and creative expression.\n\nCurator Nageen Hyat shared her thoughts on the occasion, saying, “It gives me great pleasure to conceptualize and curate Sindhu Sur-Melody of Sindhu, highlighting the rich culture of Sindh through illumination and contemporary art.\n\nThe participating artists aim to revive traditional skills and reconnect them with today’s creative landscape.”\n\nMs. Mariam Ahmed, Director Visual Arts Division, PNCA, added, “PNCA remains committed to providing platforms that celebrate Pakistan’s cultural diversity and empower creative voices nationwide.
