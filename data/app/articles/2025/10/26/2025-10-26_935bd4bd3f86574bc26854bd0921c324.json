  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (APP): Speaker National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Sunday said that 27th October, 1947 marks a dark chapter in history, the day when India forcibly occupied Jammu and Kashmir, trampling upon the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people.\n\nIn his message on Kashmir Black Day, he said that the illegal occupation that began on 27 October 1947 continues to this day through systematic oppression and denial of the right to self-determination.\n\nAyaz Sadiq reaffirmed that the right to self-determination is an inalienable and internationally recognised right of the Kashmiri people, for which they have rendered immense and unforgettable sacrifices.\nHe said that India has persistently tried to suppress this right through coercion and brutality but has utterly failed to break the resolve of the Kashmiri people.\n\nReferring to the illegal and unilateral Indian actions of 5 August 2019, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq strongly condemned the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A of the Indian Constitution, terming it a blatant violation of international law and United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions. He said these measures stripped the Kashmiri people of their distinct identity and land, which the Kashmiris have categorically rejected.\n\nThe Speaker NA reiterated Pakistan’s unwavering political, diplomatic, and moral support for the Kashmiri people’s just struggle for their right to self-determination. He also paid rich tribute to the martyrs and leaders of the Kashmir freedom movement, stating that their sacrifices will always be remembered.\n\nSardar Ayaz Sadiq stressed that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains an unfinished agenda of the partition of the subcontinent, and its resolution in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people is essential for lasting peace and stability in the region.\n\nReferring to the recent 80th Anniversary of the United Nations, Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq highlighted that the international community is emphasizing the need to strengthen and restructure the UN’s peace and conflict-resolution mechanisms.\n\nHe said this global momentum must be utilized to initiate meaningful and peaceful dialogue for the permanent resolution of long-standing conflicts, including Gaza, Palestine, and the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\n\nHe urged the international community to accelerate this process and ensure that the writ and resolutions of the United Nations Security Council are implemented in their true letter and spirit to achieve enduring international and regional peace.\n\nSpeaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq called upon the international community to play its due role in supporting the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination and in ending human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.",
