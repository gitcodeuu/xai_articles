Lifestyle Medicine offers a clear path forward to build a healthier nation,” he emphasized.\n\n“ICLM 2025 is not just a conference—it’s a movement toward a more compassionate, community-centered model of healthcare,” said Dr Shagufta Feroz , Director of RILM.\n\n“We hope every attendee leaves inspired to become an agent of change in their own communities,” he added.\n\nReflecting its “whole-person” philosophy, ICLM 2025 integrates science with wellbeing—offering plant-based meals, meditation and mindfulness sessions, and discussions on digital health, sleep, and behavioral change,\n\nThe program included plenary talks, workshops, and research presentations focused on nutrition, movement, emotional resilience, and social connection as the pillars of a healthier society.\n\nWith PALM leading advocacy, training, and education, and RILM pioneering clinical integration and academic innovation, Pakistan continues to emerge as a regional hub for Lifestyle Medicine—redefining health as not merely the absence of disease, but the presence of vitality, purpose, and connection.\n\nDelegates from the United States, United Kingdom, UAE, and across Pakistan are collaborating on research, training, and advocacy initiatives to strengthen preventive medicine and medical education across South Asia. The event will conclude with the “Islamabad Declaration”—a set of recommendations to integrate lifestyle medicine into primary healthcare, policy, and medical curricula nationwide.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
