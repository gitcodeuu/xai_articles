Amir Muqam has said that October 27 will once again be observed as “Black Day” across Pakistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and among Kashmiri communities worldwide to condemn India’s illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAddressing a press conference along with leaders of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) at Aiwan-e-Iqbal, here on Sunday, the minister said that the day marks India’s forcible and unlawful occupation of Jammu and Kashmir on October 27, 1947, in blatant violation of the principles of partition, human rights, and United Nations resolutions. He said Pakistan and its people have always stood shoulder to shoulder with their Kashmiri brothers and sisters and will continue to do so until they are granted their inalienable right to self-determination.\n\nEngr. Amir Muqam paid rich tribute to the unmatched sacrifices of the Kashmiri people, saying that more than 8,316 people have been martyred in fake encounters and illegal detentions, over 100,000 houses destroyed, 22,000 women widowed, 1,916 children orphaned, and 11,229 women subjected to assault under Indian occupation. He said thousands of Hurriyat leaders remain imprisoned, while India is trying to execute senior leader Yasin Malik. “More than 900,000 Indian troops have turned the occupied valley into a prison,” he said, urging the international community to ensure implementation of UN resolutions for the freedom of Kashmiris.\n\nThe minister said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has boldly presented the Kashmir cause at global forums, exposing Indian atrocities and highlighting the plight of oppressed Kashmiris. He said that Pakistan will continue its political, moral, and diplomatic support to the people of Jammu and Kashmir until their legitimate struggle reaches its destination. “The issue of Kashmir is not of one party, it is the issue of all Pakistanis,” he added.\n\nEngr. Amir Muqam announced that a one-minute silence will be observed at 10 a.m. on Sunday across the country to express solidarity with the Kashmiri people, while rallies and walks will also be held in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. He said that the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs is coordinating with all relevant departments to observe Kashmir Black Day in an organized and impactful manner, to send a strong and clear message to the international community that the Kashmir issue must be resolved in accordance with the will of the Kashmiri people and in line with the United Nations resolutions.\n\nTo a question about Azad Kashmir’s political situation, the minister said that although the AJK Prime Minister is an honest man, he has failed to control the situation and that a change in government has become inevitable. He said the PML-N in AJK has decided not to join any coalition government and will sit on the opposition benches. “The development of Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan is our foremost priority,” he added.\n\nTo another query, he said that every political party has the democratic right to form government, but urged the Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to act responsibly and speak within constitutional limits. “Khyber Pakhtunkhwa is part of Pakistan. If provinces start negotiating with foreign countries independently, where will the federation stand?” he asked.\n\nEngr Amir Muqam emphasized that the real issue in South Asia is the Kashmir dispute, which should be resolved in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions. He appreciated the growing international awareness of the issue, saying even global leaders, including former U.S. President Donald Trump, have recognized the need for a just resolution of the Kashmir conflict.\n\nEarlier, senior APHC leader Syed Faiz Ahmad Nakshbandi, while speaking on the occasion, expressed profound gratitude to the Government and people of Pakistan for their unwavering and effective support to the oppressed people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. He thanked the Federal Minister for his comprehensive statement and steadfast advocacy for the Kashmir cause.\n\nNakshbandi lauded Pakistan’s continued efforts to expose the grave human rights violations being perpetrated by Indian occupation forces in occupied Kashmir and for effectively presenting the true situation before the international community. He also extended appreciation to the Pakistani media for amplifying the voices of Kashmiris across the world, describing them as “our pen and eyes” that convey the truth of Kashmir’s struggle for freedom to the global audience.\n\nHe said that October 27 is observed as Black Day by Kashmiris across Azad Jammu and Kashmir, Pakistan, and the diaspora worldwide to send a strong and unified message to India against its illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nRecalling the tragic events of October 27, 1947, Nakshbandi said Indian forces had unlawfully landed in Kashmir through a fraudulent and forceful act, which was strongly condemned by the people of Srinagar. Since that day, he noted, India has continued to commit atrocities in the occupied territory, including killings, arson, and enforced disappearances, under draconian laws such as the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), aimed at suppressing the Kashmiri people’s legitimate struggle for self-determination. He said that, on behalf of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, he conveyed heartfelt gratitude to the people, government, and military leadership of Pakistan for their unwavering commitment and for keeping the Kashmir cause alive on the global stage. He thanked the people and government of Pakistan for their continued support and said India’s oppression, killings, and destruction of homes remain a matter of grave concern. “Our only goal is the freedom of occupied Kashmir and the realization of our right to self-determination,” he said.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
