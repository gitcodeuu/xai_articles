  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 01 (APP): A high-level seminar on “Adapting to Climate Change and Flood Management” was held at the National Library of Pakistan on Wednesday, bringing together policymakers, security experts and climate specialists to discuss Pakistan’s growing vulnerability to floods.\nParliamentary Secretary for Information and Broadcasting Barrister Daniyal Chaudhry attended the event as the chief guest, while other notable speakers included Senator Hidayatullah, General (R) Samrez Salik, climate policy expert Sohail Malik, and Abdullah Khan, Managing Director of the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies.\nAddressing the seminar, Barrister Daniyal said that floods must be recognized as a national challenge rather than a political issue.\nHe stressed that Pakistan must move beyond political point-scoring and short-term fixes. “The floods of recent years are not just natural disasters but also indicators of systemic and administrative shortcomings. The repeated destruction in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa shows how urgently we need fundamental reforms in our disaster management structures,” he said.\nThe parliamentary secretary added that the current provincial and local governance systems lack the capacity for rapid response.\n“In remote regions like Chitral and Gilgit-Baltistan, emergency aid delivery is often delayed. These logistical gaps leave vulnerable populations exposed and demand urgent structural reforms,” he pointed out.\nRepresenting Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Senator Hidayatullah drew attention to the plight of flood victims in the province.\nHe said communities have endured displacement, food insecurity, and heavy economic losses, yet continue to demonstrate resilience.\n“The people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa must not be left to suffer in silence. Relief must go beyond temporary aid and include long-term rehabilitation programs,” he urged.\nGeneral (R) Samrez Salik added a security dimension to the discussion, warning that repeated climate-induced disasters threaten not just human lives but the stability of the state itself.\n“When populations are displaced, food supply chains are disrupted, and infrastructure collapses, it directly affects national security. Pakistan must treat climate resilience as part of its security doctrine,” he emphasized.\nBarrister Daniyal also called for a modern, technology-driven disaster management framework.\nHe highlighted the importance of early warning systems, digital mapping, and inter-provincial coordination to strengthen preparedness.\n“We need a proactive system that not only addresses today’s vulnerabilities but also prepares Pakistan for future climate shocks,” he said.\nThe seminar concluded with a consensus among participants that climate change and floods are emerging as existential threats to Pakistan’s security, economy, and long-term development.\nSpeakers urged comprehensive reforms, stronger institutions, and coordinated national action to safeguard lives, protect infrastructure, and build resilience for the future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
