  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 09 (APP):Minister for Defence Khawaja Muhammad Asif on Thursday reaffirmed Pakistan’s resolve to defend its territory and defeat terrorism through unity, determination.\nSpeaking in the National Assembly, he said that the issue of terrorism required a united approach beyond political or regional divisions. “Our political matters—whether related to Karachi, Sialkot, or Peshawar—can wait for another day. Today, our focus should be on how to eliminate this menace of terrorism once and for all,” he added.\nKhawaja Asif said that political and ideological differences should be set aside when it comes to national security.\nHe said that the Armed Forces had not only safeguarded the country’s borders in the recent war with India but also earned international recognition for their professionalism and bravery. “Our forces have proved their mettle both at home and abroad, and it is our moral obligation to stand by them,” he said.\nThe minister said the sacrifices of martyrs had brought pride and dignity to the nation. “We can proudly say that our Armed Forces have once again demonstrated their strength and strategic superiority—India still bears the scars of its defeats,” he added.\nKhawaja Asif said the credit for Pakistan’s global respect and recognition went to its Armed Forces, who had ensured national stability and enhanced the country’s international standing.\nHe said that Pakistan’s image was being positively acknowledged across the world, from the Gulf region and the Islamic world to major powers such as the United States.\n“Recently, at the United Nations, one could sense a renewed pride in Pakistan’s stature. This recognition is the result of our Armed Forces’ sacrifices and the nation’s resilience,” he said.\nThe minister said the sacrifices rendered by the Armed Forces demanded acknowledgement and national unity. “We must remember our martyrs, express condolences to their families, and demonstrate solidarity with our forces fighting terrorism,” he urged.\nHe expressed deep grief over the martyrdom of two officers and nine soldiers who laid down their lives in recent terrorist attacks, saying their sacrifices called for national unity and collective resolve to support Pakistan’s Armed Forces.\nRecalling his recent meeting with the mother of a martyred soldier, he said, “A few months ago, she told me with unwavering faith that if she had more sons, she would have sacrificed them too for Pakistan.”\nHe said such spirit and devotion among the families of martyrs were a source of strength and inspiration for the entire nation. “While we live normal lives in peace, it is because of these heroes who defend our homeland.,” he said.\nThe minister called upon all federal and provincial governments, including those of Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Punjab, and Islamabad, to stand together in solidarity with the Pakistan Army and the families of martyrs.\nRecalling his visit to Afghanistan three years ago, Khawaja Asif said he had raised the issue of cross-border terrorism directly with Afghan authorities. “We candidly told them that their soil was being used for terrorist activities in Pakistan,” he said.\nThe minister said Pakistan had urged Afghanistan to control these militants and dismantle their sanctuaries. “We asked them to shut down the safe havens and stop providing shelter or support to these groups,” he said.\nHe added that Afghan officials had demanded financial assistance, claiming that with such aid, they could relocate these groups to western provinces away from Pakistan’s border.\nHowever, Khawaja Asif said Pakistan had sought a firm guarantee that these militants would not return—a condition the Afghan authorities were unwilling to accept. “Due to the absence of that assurance, the proposal could not be finalized,” he said.\nKhawaja Asif also proposed urgent diplomatic action to curb cross-border terrorism, suggesting that a delegation be sent to Kabul within the next day or two to press Afghan authorities to dismantle safe havens being used against Pakistan.\nMeanwhile, former Speaker of the National Assembly Asad Qaiser paid rich tribute to the martyrs who laid down their lives in various operations for the country’s security and stability.\nHe said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) highly valued the sacrifices of those who had embraced martyrdom in the line of duty, both within the country and along its borders.\nAsad Qaiser emphasized that PTI firmly believed in strengthening national institutions to ensure Pakistan’s progress and stability. “We consider this country our own, and the Armed Forces are ours. Therefore, we salute their sacrifices and pay them our deepest respects,” he said.\nHe reaffirmed that PTI stood united with the security forces in their mission to defend the homeland and uphold national integrity. Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Amir Dogar said that the entire House stood united in denouncing terrorism and expressing solidarity with the armed forces.\nHe particularly paid tribute to the 11 valiant soldiers who were martyred in the Orakzai district. Amir Dogar said that over the past 25 years, Pakistan—particularly Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan—had suffered immensely from terrorism, with nearly 90,000 people, including soldiers, police personnel, and civilians, having lost their lives.\n“The entire nation stands behind its armed forces in this fight for Pakistan’s stability and survival,” he added. MNA Shahida Akhtar said Pakistan was facing multifaceted challenges, emphasizing the need to strengthen the state and its institutions instead of engaging in political rivalries or personal agendas.\nShe praised the armed forces for their sacrifices in the fight against terrorism, saying that the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI) had always stood by the martyrs and would continue to support the defenders of the nation. “We salute the brave soldiers who laid down their lives for Pakistan. The martyr’s death is the life of the nation,” she added.\nShe called upon all political parties to rise above their differences and take a unified stance against terrorism. “This House should not only unite in times of external threats or natural disasters but also for the welfare of our people and the stability of Pakistan,” she said.\nEarlier, the National Assembly offered Fateha for the 11 officers and soldiers who embraced martyrdom during an operation against Indian-sponsored terrorists.\nAt the beginning of the session, Deputy Speaker Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah requested Member of the National Assembly Ali Muhammad Khan to lead the Fateha Khwani for the martyrs. The lawmakers prayed for the elevation of the martyrs’ ranks in heaven and for strength and patience for their bereaved families.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
