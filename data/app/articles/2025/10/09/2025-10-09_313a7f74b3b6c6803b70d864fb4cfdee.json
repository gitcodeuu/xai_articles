  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 09 (APP):Muttahida Qaumi Movement-Pakistan (MQM-P) leader Dr. Farooq Sattar on Thursday lauded Pakistan’s leadership for recent diplomatic and economic achievements, while emphasizing the need for national unity in the face of renewed security challenges.\nSpeaking in the National Assembly, Dr. Sattar said the country’s progress on the external front and improving economic indicators reflected growing global confidence in Pakistan. However, he warned that recent terrorist incidents in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Balochistan, and North Waziristan indicated a resurgence of threats aimed at destabilizing the nation.\nHe paid rich tribute to the armed forces personnel who embraced martyrdom during an intelligence-based operation (IBO) in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’s Orakzai district, stating that “the entire nation stands shoulder to shoulder with its defenders.”\nDr. Sattar praised Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif, Field Marshal General Asim Munir, and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar for their roles in improving Pakistan’s global standing and strengthening foreign relations.\nHe said that despite external propaganda and hybrid warfare tactics targeting Pakistan, the government and security institutions had demonstrated strong resolve. “Our leadership has shown nerves of steel amid multifaceted political, economic, and security challenges,” he remarked.\nDr. Sattar noted that the success achieved on May 10 marked a turning point for Pakistan’s global image, opening doors for renewed engagement with key partners, including the United States, Europe, and Arab countries. “These developments have revived hope and confidence in the country’s future,” he added.\nThe MQM leader stressed that economic stability and national security were deeply interlinked. “No nation can ensure lasting peace without a strong economy. Unemployment, poverty, and inflation are among the biggest challenges we must overcome,” he said.\nDr. Sattar also called for a unified stance by all political parties to condemn and combat terrorism in every form—religious, ethnic, or regional. He urged political reconciliation at both national and provincial levels, saying that “polarization must give way to dialogue, cooperation, and collective national interest.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
