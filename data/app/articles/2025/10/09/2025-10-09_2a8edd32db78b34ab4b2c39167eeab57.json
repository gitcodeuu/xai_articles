The team — comprising Minahil Rukhsar, Muhammad Numan Umar, Faiza Mazhar, and Maryam Rukhsar — developed a Centralized Collaborative System for the Supreme Court of Pakistan, aimed at automating and streamlining judicial work-flows.\nAddressing the closing ceremony, Rabiya Javeri Agha, Chairperson NCHR, commended the participants for their forward-thinking ideas:Dr. Samuel Rizk, Resident Representative of UNDP Pakistan, emphasized the human-centered role of technology:\n“Technology is most powerful when it serves people, not just markets. This hackathon reflects exactly that spirit. UNDP is proud to work with NCHR and the EU to turn ideas into action through the creativity and drive of young minds shaping the future of justice in Pakistan.”\nSpeaking on behalf of the Ministry of Law and Justice, Barrister Aqeel Malik, Minister of State for Law and Justice, reaffirmed the government’s commitment to supporting innovation-led reform:\nHe added that technology, when thoughtfully applied, can serve as a tool for transparency, efficiency, and accountability — ultimately making justice more humane and accessible.\nThe event was attended by representatives from Jazz, the Malala Fund, various UN agencies, and other international and local stakeholders. The all-women panel of judges — Jehan Ara, founder of Katalyst Labs; Sarah Belal, Executive Director of Justice Project Pakistan; and Rohma Labeeb, Country Director of Accelerate Prosperity — ensured a fair and balanced evaluation of the finalists’ work.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
