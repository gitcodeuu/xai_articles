  "content": "ISLAMABAD, October 09 (APP):As Pakistan’s logistics sector evolves amid growing investment and infrastructure reforms, Saudi-based supply chain expert Muhammad Tahir Siddiqui has called for a practical, data-driven approach to modernizing the country’s transport and logistics networks, anchored in rail integration, digital connectivity, and workforce empowerment.\nSpeaking in the context of deepening Pakistan–Saudi economic cooperation under Vision 2030 and Pakistan’s investment-led growth framework, Siddiqui emphasized that logistics and infrastructure have become shared priorities between the two nations. Saudi interest in Pakistan’s ports, rail corridors, and industrial zones, he said, complements Islamabad’s efforts to enhance supply chain resilience and efficiency.\nA seasoned logistics professional with experience at Airbus Helicopters in Riyadh and Procter & Gamble in Pakistan, Siddiqui outlined a pragmatic roadmap: shift suitable bulk freight to rail, connect data across the logistics chain, and empower frontline teams. “Resilience and agility are not opposites,” he said. “A chain that can reroute quickly while maintaining standards is the chain that delivers.”\nHe identified heavy lanes such as cement, steel, fertilizers, and packaged goods as natural candidates for rail transport, provided schedules remain reliable and handoffs seamless. He urged private operators to run controlled pilots, share before-and-after results, and scale up only when data supports the economics.\nAt the core of his strategy lies data integration. Drawing from experience with SAP systems and Power BI dashboards, Siddiqui argued that “if warehouse and transport systems don’t talk, planners are guessing.” He advocated for unified ETA tracking, early alerts, and regular data-driven performance reviews to strengthen decision-making.\nSiddiqui also underscored the importance of people and process discipline – training supervisors to solve problems on-site, maintaining daily safety routines, and rewarding skill-based leadership. “Technology only delivers when people own their numbers,” he said.\nOn costs and sustainability, he said efficiency and environmental goals can align: route optimization reduces fuel waste, energy-smart warehouses cut bills, and rail transport lowers emissions and congestion. “Savings that don’t hurt service are the ones that last,” he said, urging firms to back reforms with clean data and transparent performance evaluations.\nHe acknowledged infrastructure constraints such as uneven track quality and limited rolling stock but urged prioritization instead of hesitation. “Pick the lanes with the best shot at success. Wire up their data first. Build flood-season playbooks before the monsoon,” he suggested.\nFrom a regional perspective, Siddiqui highlighted the role of new trade corridors and public–private partnerships in reshaping connectivity across South Asia and the Middle East. He called for greater transparency and shared performance metrics, emphasizing traceability as a non-negotiable standard in modern supply chains.\nLooking ahead, Siddiqui said progress will be measured “not by broad claims but by a few well-run pilots” – one freight lane shifted to rail with verified efficiency gains, one exporter integrating customs visibility into logistics data, one distributor cutting empty miles and reinvesting savings.\n“These are small steps,” he said, “but they compound into real change when companies make them routine. The opportunity is here for those ready to act.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
