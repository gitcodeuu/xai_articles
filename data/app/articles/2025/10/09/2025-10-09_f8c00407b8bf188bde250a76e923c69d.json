Work is reportedly continuing around the clock.\nChairman Randhawa expressed satisfaction with the pace of work.\n“The T-Chowk Flyover will significantly reduce traffic congestion and provide smooth, signal-free movement for commuters,” he said.\nHe directed the CDA team to expedite work further to meet deadlines and ensure quality.\n“High construction standards must be maintained at all costs,” he stressed.\nRandhawa also instructed the development of a landscaping and horticulture plan to enhance the project’s aesthetic appeal and called for the installation of permanent LED lighting. “Cleanliness must be ensured in all completed sections,” he added, emphasising both efficiency and safety.\nThe T-Chowk Flyover is a key infrastructure project intended to improve connectivity between Islamabad and neighbouring areas, including Punjab, by easing one of the busiest traffic corridors in the capital region. Its completion is expected to reduce travel times, improve commuter convenience, and support economic activity.\nConstruction of the flyover is a central part of the CDA’s broader urban development agenda, aligning with Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s direction to fast-track major infrastructure projects.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
