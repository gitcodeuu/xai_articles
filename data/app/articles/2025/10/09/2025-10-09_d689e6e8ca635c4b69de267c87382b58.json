The Committee, it was noted, is tasked with formulating concrete recommendations to accelerate resolution of such cases and reviewing proposals from the Attorney General for Pakistan concerning the recognition and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards.\nParticipants acknowledged that the establishment of specialized commercial benches across the High Courts has already delivered encouraging results by reducing pendency. Justice Siddiqui appreciated these outcomes and suggested extending the specialized bench model to cases involving foreign arbitral awards for swift and expert adjudication.\nChairman FBR while welcoming judiciary’s proactive engagement, affirmed FBR’s commitment to strengthen institutional coordination and expeditious resolution of revenue-related disputes. He also endorsed the proposal to create a dedicated Legal Department within FBR to ensure consistent legal strategy and institutional support.\nConcluding the session, Justice Siddiqui reaffirmed the judiciary’s resolve to enhance judicial efficiency and foster effective inter-institutional collaboration, which is vital for strengthening economic governance and ease of business. The Committee’s recommendations will be submitted to the NJPMC for consideration in its forthcoming meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
