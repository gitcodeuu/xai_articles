It reminds us that the true strength of a nation lies in empowering all its citizens without discrimination.\nThe government of Pakistan remains committed to its goals of inclusion, accessibility, and equal education. “We are determined to create employment opportunities for persons with visual impairments and fulfill our responsibilities under the UN Convention on the rights of persons with disabilities,” the prime minister added.\n“We take great pride in the achievements of our visually impaired citizens, who continue to bring international recognition to Pakistan in various fields,” he said adding that a shining example is Saima Saleem, Pakistan’s first visually impaired civil servant and diplomat, currently serving at Pakistan’s Permanent Mission to the United Nations.\nHe also called for building a Pakistan where every citizen, regardless of any physical limitation or challenge, can move forward freely, contribute fully to the nation’s development, and pursue their dreams without barriers.\n“May Allah Almighty bless our efforts and guide us toward a Pakistan that embodies mutual respect, compassion, and harmony,” the prime minister added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
