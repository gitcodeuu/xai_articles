It is not the job of the court to recommend any officer. The court has no sympathy for any officer. Why not send the matter to the Prime Minister that you are seeking a recommendation in the court?\nJustice Mohsin Akhtar said that if someone is going on deputation, let him go. Don’t talk about such things here. He is a public servant, there is no special feature in an officer. Have you come here for your work or have you come to save the job of an officer, the court asked.\nThe court rejected the miscellaneous application for the transfer of the CDA Deputy Commissioner and directed the CDA to decide on the applications of the C-13 victims within a month and adjourned the hearing of the case till next month.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
