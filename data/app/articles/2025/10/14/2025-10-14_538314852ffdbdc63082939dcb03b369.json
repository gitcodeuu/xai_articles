After several follow-up meetings, the Committee decided to return the NHA’s reply to the House along with the remarks submitted by the Honorable Member.\nThe Calling Attention notice moved by Mr. Sahibzada Sibghatullah, MNA, concerning the inflated prices of essential food items at motorway toll areas, was deferred to the next meeting due to the absence of the Honorable Member.\nThe Committee reviewed “The Toll Plaza Rationalization and Equity Bill, 2025” as moved by Syed Abrar Ali Shah.
