The decision further said that all fines and penalties imposed on the appellants are cancelled. The appellants were accused of misrepresentation and evasion of duty and tax in imported goods, the value of which was stated to be more than Rs 19.2 million.\nOn this basis, the Customs Collector had ordered to confiscate the goods and impose a fine of 20 percent, which the appellants had challenged in the tribunal.\nThe tribunal ruled that since the goods are still at the sluggish dry port of Gilgit-Baltistan and duty and tax evasion have not been proven, they should be re-inspected at the request of the petitioners.\nAccording to the decision, all consignments are under 100 percent customs inspection. The total value of these petitions under hearing in the Customs Appellate Tribunal was more than Rs 13 billion, while the tribunal has pronounced decisions on petitions worth more than Rs 109 billion in the last 14 months.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
