  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP):The Pakistan Business Forum (PBF) on Tuesday strongly endorsed the recent strategic actions undertaken by Pakistan’s Armed Forces in response to escalating cross-border violations and threats.\nThe leadership of PBF talking to APP on Tuesday praised the precision, professionalism, and restraint demonstrated by the military in neutralizing terror elements operating with external support.\nPBF President Khawaja Mehboob ur Rehman stated that Pakistan’s business community stands united behind the Armed Forces, who have once again proven their unwavering commitment to safeguarding the country’s borders without compromising humanitarian principles. “The surgical strikes conducted with exceptional accuracy have reaffirmed that Pakistan will not remain passive in the face of threats to its national integrity,” he said.\nPBF Chief Organiser, Chaudhry Ahmad Jawad highlighted that while Pakistan has historically shown unparalleled hospitality, particularly towards its neighbors, this goodwill must not be mistaken for weakness.\nHe said “Pakistan has hosted millions of Afghan refugees for over four decades — offering shelter, education, and economic opportunities. However, recent provocations and support for anti-Pakistan elements from across the western border are deeply concerning,” he remarked.\nWhile expressing grave concern, Senior Vice President Amna Awan added that the shift in tone and conduct from Kabul is disappointing. “The region’s peace hinges on mutual respect and responsible governance. Any attempt to destabilize Pakistan through proxy violence cannot and will not be tolerated,” she emphasized.\nChairman Central Punjab Mohammad Naseer Malik said the swift action by the Armed Forces reinforces Pakistan’s stance that national security is non-negotiable.\nChairman South Punjab, Malik Talat Suhail noted that the business community fully backs the state in its efforts to root out terrorism and secure economic stability.\nChairman Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ashfaq Paracha highlighted the importance of a unified national front, particularly in provinces closest to the western frontier.\nChairman Balochistan Daroo Khan Achakzai underscored the historic sacrifices made by Pakistan, especially in Balochistan, in the fight against terrorism and extremism.\nThe PBF leadership collectively acknowledged the Armed Forces’ operational excellence, ensuring no civilian casualties during the cross-border missions — a testament to Pakistan’s commitment to ethical conduct even during military engagements.\nThe forum further reiterated that any external aggression or internal conspiracy against the country’s peace, economy, or people will be met with a resolute and united response from every segment of society — especially the business community, which recognizes peace as the foundation of progress.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
