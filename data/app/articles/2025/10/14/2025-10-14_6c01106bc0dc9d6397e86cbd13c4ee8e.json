  "content": "ISLAMABAD, October 14 (APP):The sub-committee of the National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony on Tuesday reviewed the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) governing the annual parliamentary delegation’s visit to the Roza-e-Rasool (Peace Be Upon Him) on 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal.\nThe meeting, chaired by Convener Shagufta Jumani, focused on identifying shortcomings in the existing SOPs and proposed amendments to make them more effective and well-structured. The members unanimously agreed on the need to update the procedures first formulated in 2020 to ensure smoother coordination and better facilitation for the sacred visit.\nSeveral members shared their inputs on the proposed revisions, which the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony was directed to incorporate into the SOPs and present in the next meeting for approval.\nThe sub-committee also decided to invite the Additional Secretary for the Middle East from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the upcoming session to discuss logistical and diplomatic arrangements related to the visit.\nConvener Shagufta Jumani emphasized that the 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal visit represents a profound expression of devotion to the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him).\nShe urged that the delegation’s access to other holy sites during the visit also be ensured and announced that the sub-committee would formally request the Speaker of the National Assembly to personally lead the delegation next year.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
