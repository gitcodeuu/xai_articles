  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP):The Ministry of Law and Justice has launched a Dashboard to track progress against the Anti-Rape Act 2021, a landmark initiative designed to strengthen transparency, accountability, and data-driven policymaking across Pakistan’s justice system.\nDeveloped under the framework of the Anti-Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act, 2021, the dashboard consolidates national data from key institutional mechanisms established to improve the response to sexual and gender-based violence.\nThis includes statistics on Anti-Rape Crisis Cells, Special Prosecutors, Special Courts, Special Sexual Offences Investigation Units, and the Sex Offenders Register (SOR). By presenting integrated insights on institutional performance, and inter-agency coordination, the platform enables policymakers, reform committees, and the public to monitor implementation and outcomes more effectively.\nThe MoLJ Dashboard represents a major step toward modernising justice delivery through digital governance and transparency. It provides an evidence-based foundation for reform, allowing the Ministry and its partners to identify systemic gaps, improve coordination between investigation and trial stages, and enhance services for survivors of sexual offences.\nThe initiative reflects the Ministry’s commitment to strengthening rule of law through innovation, openness, and data-driven reform. The dashboard can be accessed at:  https://molaw.gov.pk/Detail/NjYzNjFiOTQtMDI1YS00YjcyLTk4YmEtMjExNjUxODlmNWEz\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
