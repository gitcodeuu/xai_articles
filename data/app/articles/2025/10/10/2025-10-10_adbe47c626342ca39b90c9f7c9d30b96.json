  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 10 (APP):Speaker of the National Assembly Sardar Ayaz Sadiq announced on Friday that the digitisation process has been initiated to establish an e-Parliament, aimed at modernising the legislative system.\nSpeaking at the start of the National Assembly session, the Speaker said the digitisation work had almost been completed in the Secretariat, while the system would soon be extended to the Parliament Lodges for the facilitation of members.\nHe said that under the new system, members would receive the Order of the Day, a copy of the Constitution, the Rules of Business, and other legislative documents digitally instead of in paper form.\n“A help desk has been set up at Gate where members can configure their passwords and collect their iPads,” he added.\nThe Speaker urged members to inform colleagues who were not present in the House to collect their iPads as well. “Once members start using the new digital system, the practice of placing paper documents on their desks will be discontinued,” he said.\nAyaz Sadiq further said that in case any member forgets to bring their iPad, a limited number of paper copies or spare devices would be available as a backup.\nHe added that the new system would enable members to conveniently access the Order of the Day, the Constitution, and the Rules of Business from anywhere, making their parliamentary work more efficient.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
