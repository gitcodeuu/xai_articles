  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 18 (APP): Mastung is set to get a new 220-kilovolt (kv) grid station to strengthen the power transmission network and improve electricity supply reliability in Balochistan.\nAccording to official documents available with Wealth Pakistan, the National Grid Company (NGC) has finalized the site for the new grid station at Moza Chakol Kalozai, located about three kilometres from Mastung city.\nThe site was chosen after detailed technical surveys, land assessments, and consultations with multiple government departments.\nOfficials said the new grid will enhance power transmission capacity, reduce voltage fluctuations, and support uninterrupted electricity supply to Mastung, Kalat, Quetta, and nearby areas that face shortages.\nThe project falls under the federal government’s broader plan to upgrade Balochistan’s transmission infrastructure and ensure sustainable energy access across the province.\nFollowing detailed scrutiny, the Chief Engineer (Design) convened the Sitting and Layout Board, which approved Moza Chakol Kalozai as the most feasible and technically sound site for the 220kV Mastung Grid Station. The location was chosen for its suitable terrain, accessibility, and proximity to existing transmission lines.\nA senior official from the Ministry of Energy (Power Division) told Wealth Pakistan that the new grid will help stabilize Balochistan’s power network and meet rising industrial and residential demand. “This project will significantly reduce load constraints and improve voltage stability in southern Balochistan,” he added.\nThe documents also show progress on related transmission projects, including the 765/500/220/132kV Islamabad West Grid Station (Lot-IV) — a World Bank–financed project under Pakistan’s power infrastructure enhancement program.\nExecuted by M/s NWEPDI–TBEA JV with M/s GOPA Intec as consultant, the USD 180 million Islamabad West project began on May 21, 2024, and is due for completion by January 21, 2027. A 1,625-kanal site was handed over in July 2024, and construction of boundary walls and equipment procurement is underway. The NTDC reports 18 percent physical and 16.8 percent financial progress, with work proceeding as scheduled.\nBoth the Mastung Grid Station and other ongoing projects represent vital investments in modernizing Pakistan’s national transmission system and providing stable, regionally balanced power supply.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
