  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): Islamabad Traffic Police (ITP) suspended two traffic officers following allegations that a biker was manhandled by police officials at a checkpoint, raising public concern and demands for action on social media. Chief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (retd) Hamza Humayun took the matter seriously and issued suspension orders pending a formal inquiry.\nCTO Hamza stated that misuse of authority in uniform would not be tolerated and directed all officers to maintain polite and professional conduct while performing their duties.\nShahnawaz, a citizen, told APP, “While citizens must respect the law, any punishment should be decided by courts, not by officials on the spot. The authority to penalize rests with the courts, not with individual officers.\nIbrahim, a private company rider, shared his grievance, saying, “Many times, traffic officials get aggressive when they see our specific-colored helmets. We work under financial pressure, and CTO Hamza should ensure that his officers avoid unfair behavior towards riders.”\nSarfaraz, a resident of I-9, called the CTO’s action a positive step, saying, “When senior officers take timely action, it discourages those officials who misuse their powers.”\nOfficials said the suspended officers will remain off duty until the inquiry is completed. They reiterated that ITP is committed to promoting road safety and ensuring smooth traffic flow, while maintaining professional and ethical enforcement.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
