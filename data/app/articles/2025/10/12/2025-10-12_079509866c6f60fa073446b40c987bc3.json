  "content": "PESHAWAR, Oct 12 (APP):Pakistani security forces have launched a robust retaliatory strikes against unprovoked aggression of the Afghan Talibans and Fitnaul Khawaraj, destroying multiple posts of the aggressor and terrorists hideouts, while capturing 19 key posts across the border, security sources confirmed on Sunday.\nThe retaliatory strikes were carried out following unprovoked gunfire from Afghan Talibans and Fitnaul  Khwaraj targeting several Pakistani border posts, including those in Angoor Adda, Bajaur, and Kurram last night.\nAdditional cross-border attacks were also reported in Dir, Chitral, Baramcha, and other border areas of KP.\nThe security sources told APP on Sunday that unprovoked attacks from Afghan territory were intended to facilitate the infiltration of Khawarij militants into Pakistan.\nIn response, Pakistani forces launched a coordinated counteroffensive, targeting Afghan forces positions and militant strongholds associated with Daesh and Fitnaul Khwarij.\n“Our troops responded with full force. Afghan forces were thrown into panic and reportedly requested a cessation after several of their posts, including Duran Mela and Turkmanzai terror camps, were destroyed,” a security official added.\nPakistani forces destroyed key Afghan military posts in Kurram, Jandosar, and Shahidan, inflicting significant casualties on Afghan troops and associated militant groups. The operation also targeted Kharlachi sector, where video footage confirmed the destruction of several Taliban posts and the surrender of some Afghan militants.\nIn Chagai, strikes demolished hostile checkpoints, while in Brabcha, the Taliban’s Second Battalion headquarters allegedly used as a launchpad by Fitna al-Khawarij and Fita al-Hindustan was razed to ground. The Ghaznali headquarters in the Nushki sector was also destroyed, killing dozens of militants and TTP terrorists.\nPakistani troops raised the national flag over a captured Afghan post in Angoor Adda, while another post in the Zhob sector was seized, with a Humvee vehicle destroyed in the operation.\nSecurity sources said the Durrani camps I and II, reportedly used as launchpads for cross-border raids, were hit with precision fire, killing at least 50 militants. The Taliban’s Manojaba Battalion headquarters was also wiped out.\n“These operations were not directed at civilians but specifically at terrorist hideouts and command centers,” a security official clarified.\nMeanwhile, Interior Minister Syed Mohsin Naqvi condemned the Afghan aggression declaring it a clear violation of international law, stating that Pakistan’s response proved such provocations would be met with force.\nHe said Afghanistan is playing a dangerous game of fire and blood, allegedly with Indian support. The people of Pakistan stand like a reinforced wall with the armed forces,” he said.\nTribal elders also voiced strong support for the Pakistan military, pledging to stand by the Armed Forces of Pakistan in its efforts to protect the homeland from all threats.\nMeanwhile, the international community has expressed concern over the escalation as Saudi Arabia urged both nations to show restraint and pursue dialogue.\nIran offered to mediate, calling for urgent talks while Qatar emphasized the need for peace and warned of regional instability if tensions persist.\nTensions between Islamabad and Kabul have grown in recent months, with Pakistan repeatedly calling on Afghanistan’s interim government to act against terrorist groups operating from its soil, particularly the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP).\nSince the Taliban’s return to power in 2021, Pakistan has witnessed a surge in cross-border attacks, especially in KP and Balochistan.\nThe Afghan Govt has failed to stop the infiltration of Fitnaul Khwarij and secure border, complicating security and diplomatic relations.\nA recent UN Security Council report confirmed a nexus between the Afghan Taliban and TTP, claiming that Kabul continues to provide logistical, operational, and financial support to the banned terrorist outfit.\nPakistan has also intensified the Illegal Foreigners Repatriation Plan, under which more than 554,000 undocumented Afghans have been repatriated since April 2025.\nDG ISPR Lt. Gen. Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry in a recent press conference at Peshawar said that Pakistan had raised its deep concerns with Afghanistan through multiple channels, including the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, and the UAE.\n“The space given to non-state actors in Afghanistan is not only against Pakistan’s interests but also dangerous for Afghanistan itself,” he said, reiterating that evidence had been shared with Kabul, including proof of Indian proxies using Afghan soil to launch attacks on Pakistan.\nHe highlighted that much of the U.S. military equipment left behind after the withdrawal had ended up in the hands of terrorist networks.\nThe official emphasized that while Pakistan desires peaceful relations, it will respond decisively to any further aggression, adding that the strikes were aimed solely at dismantling anti-Pakistan terror infrastructure and not harming Afghan civilians.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
