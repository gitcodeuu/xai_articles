  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has strongly condemned the incidents of unprovoked firing by Afghan forces on Pakistani territory, terming it a blatant violation of international law and norms of neighborly relations.\nIn a strongly worded statement issued on Sunday, the Interior Minister said that the firing on civilian areas by Afghan forces reflects a reckless and hostile attitude that threatens regional peace and stability. “Firing by Afghan forces on civilian populations is a blatant violation of international law,” he said.\nMohsin Naqvi praised Pakistan’s security forces for their swift and effective response, stating that the prompt retaliation has made it clear that any provocation will not be tolerated under any circumstances. “Our brave forces have once again demonstrated that Pakistan’s sovereignty and security are non-negotiable,” he asserted.\nThe Interior Minister said that Pakistan’s forces remain fully alert and vigilant along the border, and a strong message is being sent to Afghanistan through an effective and measured response. He emphasized that the “dangerous game” being played by Afghanistan appears to be influenced by Pakistan’s “perennial enemy,” without naming any country.\n“The people of Pakistan stand shoulder to shoulder with their valiant armed forces like a wall of steel,” Naqvi declared. He further warned that Afghanistan will be given a decisive response similar to the one Pakistan delivered to India in the past, ensuring that no one dares to look toward Pakistan with hostile intent.\nThe Interior Minister reiterated Pakistan’s commitment to regional peace but said that peace cannot come at the cost of national dignity and security. “While Pakistan desires friendly relations with all neighboring countries, any aggression against our people and territory will be met with an iron hand,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
