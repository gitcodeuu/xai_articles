  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP): Pakistan has fast-tracked post-flood reconstruction in Balochistan under the World Bank-funded Integrated Flood Resilience and Adaptation Project (IFRAP), completing 7,031 new houses for affected families and targeting another 3,000 units in October 2025.\nThe US$161 million component titled “Resilient Housing Reconstruction and Restoration” is the largest part of IFRAP and is jointly implemented by the Quetta-based Housing Reconstruction Unit (HRU) and the Federal Project Management Unit of the Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives (MoPDSI) and the Government of Balochistan.\nAccording to documents available with Wealth Pakistan, the project envisions rebuilding 97,000 housing units while establishing and strengthening village reconstruction committees to promote community-led rebuilding and long-term climate resilience.\nThe government is currently verifying data for 284,312 flood-affected individuals across 33 districts to ensure transparency in fund utilization. So far, 231,661 beneficiaries (81.4%) have been revalidated under the system.\nThe Housing Reconstruction Unit has achieved its physical and financial targets for FY2024-25 and continues to build momentum in the current fiscal year.\nFinancial records show that PKR 4.5 billion was allocated in FY2024-25, against which PKR 5.75 billion was released and fully utilized. For FY2025-26, the allocation has surged to PKR 18 billion, with PKR 2.7 billion released and PKR 2.44 billion utilized so far.\nConstruction work has begun in 13 districts, where 27,109 beneficiaries have started rebuilding their homes after receiving the first tranche of the housing grant through designated partner organizations.\nTo ensure accountability, a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&E) system has been rolled out for real-time tracking, quality assurance, and tranche verification.\nThe government has also introduced several innovative measures to resolve operational challenges — including seeking the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) support to improve fund disbursement, and enabling partner banks to process withdrawals through local banking agents for easier access in remote areas.\nLocal construction material suppliers are being encouraged to scale up delivery, while mason training programs have been launched to uphold quality standards and create local employment opportunities.\nA senior official Planning Ministry told Wealth Pakistan that the housing reconstruction drive under IFRAP is not just about rebuilding homes, it’s about restoring livelihoods, empowering communities, and strengthening Pakistan’s climate resilience in one of its most vulnerable provinces.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
