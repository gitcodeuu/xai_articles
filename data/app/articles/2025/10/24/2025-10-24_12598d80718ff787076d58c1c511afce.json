Pakistan, he added, is committed to reducing road traffic fatalities through stronger regulation, enforcement, and public awareness.\n\nThe president outlined Pakistan’s ongoing efforts to upgrade road infrastructure and modernise traffic management systems. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to building a safer, more inclusive, and sustainable transport network.\n\nPresident Zardari expressed confidence that the Office of the UN Secretary-General’s Special Envoy and UNECE would continue to work with Pakistan to advance shared goals on road safety.\n\nTodt informed the President that road accidents claim nearly 1.2 million lives across the world every year. He noted that reducing this alarming number requires concerted efforts towards better road safety education, stricter law enforcement, improved quality of roads, and safer vehicles. He further pointed out that road crashes also cause economic losses worth billions of dollars globally each year.\n\nSenator Sherry Rehman and Senator Saleem Mandviwalla were also present during the meeting.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
