He noted that despite the availability of natural resources, population pressures and unsustainable consumption have intensified water insecurity.\n\nHe pointed out that floods, often seen as disasters, can also serve as natural recharge systems that replenish groundwater reserves when properly managed. He called for adopting nature-based and climate-resilient solutions to sustain Pakistan’s water resources, including efficient infrastructure, public awareness, and evidence-based policymaking.\n\nHe stressed the need to recognize water as an economic good, to value and price it appropriately, and to ensure that research and innovation guide future water governance in Pakistan.\n\nDr. Shujaat noted that access to safe and clean water was both a basic human right and a cornerstone of national productivity. Despite Pakistan’s extensive natural endowments, he said, the country faces significant challenges including contamination, over-extraction, and institutional weaknesses that make water insecurity one of the nation’s gravest public-health challenges.\n\nCiting UNICEF data, he emphasized that nearly 70 percent of households use contaminated water, and 30 to 40 percent of diseases—such as diarrhea, hepatitis, and typhoid—stem directly from unsafe water consumption.\n\n“The challenge is not just scarcity—it is coordination and management challenges that affect both human and economic development,” he stated.\n\nDr. Hifza Rasheed’s revealed a comprehensive national overview and said that Pakistan’s per-capita freshwater availability had plummeted from 5,260 m³ in 1951 to below 1,000 m³ in 2024, officially placing the country in the “water-scarce” category. Agriculture consumes about 93 percent of available freshwater, yet irrigation efficiency remains only around 40 percent due to seepage and outdated systems, she said and added that over 1.3 million tubewells were operating in Punjab alone, with groundwater extraction now averaging 50 million acre-feet annually, causing severe depletion—depths have reached 600 to 1,200 feet in parts of Baluchistan and Islamabad.\n\nPCRWR monitoring shows that only 47 percent of Pakistan’s population currently has access to safe drinking water, a modest rise from 39 percent in 2022, but still far from the SDG 6.1 goal of universal access by 2030, she said..\n\nShe warned that unsafe water causes to an estimated 53,000 child deaths every year and contributes to Pakistan’s high rates of stunting—nearly 44 percent of children nationwide.\n\nIndustrial waste, pesticides, and untreated sewage are polluting surface and groundwater, with arsenic levels dangerously high across southern Punjab and Sindh.\n\nWater quality in the Eastern Rivers (Ravi and Sutlej) has sharply deteriorated due to transboundary pollution and unchecked industrial discharges.\n\nOnly 38 percent of domestic wastewater in Pakistan is effectively treated, and the country ranks among the top 10 nations globally with the largest population lacking access to safe water\n\nDr Hifza also highlighted Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change, noting that it ranks fifth among the world’s most water-insecure countries and faces a projected 3–6 °C temperature rise by the end of the century. The recent floods of 2025 caused an estimated USD 14.9 billion in damages and USD 15.2 billion in economic losses, exacerbating water contamination and disease outbreaks.\n\nPCRWR responded with mobile and solar-powered water-treatment units in flood-hit areas, contributing to cholera prevention and relief operations. She stressed that for every USD 1 invested in water and sanitation, the return is USD 4.3 through reduced healthcare costs and improved productivity, while Pakistan currently loses PKR 93 billion annually due to unsafe water and inefficiencies in the water sector.\n\nDespite incremental progress, Pakistan must accelerate efforts seven-fold to achieve the SDG targets for safe and affordable drinking water by 2030.\n\nDr. Hifza attributed the slow pace to coordination challenges, fragmented policies, weak enforcement, and a lack of financial sustainability in water-supply models. However, she cited promising pilot projects such as community-managed filtration plants in Karachi and metered water-supply schemes in Sargodha, which recover up to 87 percent of operational costs and demonstrate scalable, sustainable solutions.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
