We are ready to facilitate partnerships, provide land access, and ensure smooth coordination at every stage,” the minister stated.\n\nThe Ambassador of Qatar, Ali bin Mubarak Al Khater, appreciated the warm hospitality and reaffirmed Qatar’s commitment to deepening cooperation with Pakistan.\n\nHe acknowledged that Pakistan possesses immense agricultural potential and a highly skilled workforce, which can play a vital role in Qatar’s food security strategy under Vision 2030.\n\nThe Ambassador announced that the Qatari Minister of Commerce will soon visit Pakistan to discuss new investment opportunities and expressed his willingness to remain available at all times to facilitate communication and collaboration between the two sides.\n\nHe also proposed assigning focal persons from both countries to ensure continuous engagement and follow-up on mutually agreed projects.\n\nBoth sides agreed to work on formalizing collaboration through a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on agricultural cooperation and to strengthen B2B linkages between Pakistani exporters and Qatari importers.\n\nIn conclusion, Rana Tanveer Hussain reiterated that Pakistan and Qatar are bound by ties of faith, fraternity, and friendship, and that Pakistan stands ready to serve as a reliable partner in fulfilling Qatar’s agricultural and food security goals.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
