Muqam directed all relevant departments to finalize arrangements for the day’s observance.\n\nThe meeting was attended by senior officials including Additional Secretary Kamran ur Rehman Khan, APHC leadership, and representatives from key ministries and departments — including Foreign Affairs, Interior, Information and Broadcasting, Communications, Education, Information Technology, PIA, ICT Administration, Islamabad Police, Motorway Police, CDA, MCI, and provincial governments including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\n\nIt may be recalled that on October 27, 1947, Indian forces entered and illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir — an act that Kashmiris denounce every year by observing October 27 as Black Day.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
