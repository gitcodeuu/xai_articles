The forces cut communications and jammed signals as the flotilla carrying more than 40 civilian boats approached the blockaded Gaza.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, in a post on his X timeline said, “This barbarity must end. Peace must be given a chance and humanitarian aid must reach those in need.”\nHe expressed the hope and prayed for the safety of all those who have been illegally apprehended by Israeli forces and called for their immediate release.\n“Their crime was to carry aid for the hapless Palestinian people,” the prime minister remarked.",
