He emphasized that no officer will be allowed barbers, cooks, or personal attendants from the official staff, said a press release.\nAbdul Aleem Khan further instructed that there must be 100% enforcement of over-speeding and axle load policies. He announced that fines will be imposed on vehicles exceeding 120 km/h while First Information Reports (FIRs) will be registered against those driving over 150 km/h.\nTo prevent accidents and raise public awareness, he also directed the launch of awareness campaigns at entry points, distribution of pamphlets and installation of warning boards.\nThe minister stressed the need for greater vigilance against crimes on Motorways and asked NHMP to submit practical and concrete proposals regarding their respective jurisdictions.\nThe meeting also reviewed proposals to outsource the vehicle fitness inspection system and to introduce electronic monitoring on the pattern of developed countries.  Highlighting the need for efficiency and accountability, Abdul Aleem Khan remarked that lavish attitudes will not be tolerated.\n“Reduction in unnecessary expenditures and tangible performance will be the true benchmarks,” he added, urging the bureaucracy to move beyond traditional practices and adopt practical solutions.\nIssuing a one-week deadline, Federal Minister instructed the Motorway Police to demonstrate clear improvement in performance, warning that strict measures will follow in case of failure.\nHe added that only through better performance will the Motorway Police qualify for further incentives. Abdul Aleem Khan emphasized that holding offices is not a privilege but a responsibility to serve the nation, underscoring: “We must dedicate ourselves fully to this country.”\nThe meeting was attended by the Federal Secretary for Communications, Inspector General of Motorway Police and senior officials. Briefings were also given on linking the Safe City project with local police and other relevant institutions.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
