Stipends and Hunarmand programmes.\nSpeaking about the Nashonuma Programme, she said a healthy mother is the foundation of a healthy society.\nSo far, 3.6 million mothers have been registered, and an Aga Khan University study has recorded a 3.6 percent decrease in child stunting nationwide, while stunting among children under 20 months has declined by 20 percent.\nShe cautioned that if stunting is not addressed in the first two years of life, it becomes irreversible.\nDiscussing the Education Stipends Programme, Senator Khalid said it was launched in 2012 and has enabled 17 million children to attend school.\nShe added that 216 billion rupees have already been spent on children’s education, and the results are evident. This year, 503 students from across the country secured top grades in matriculation examinations, including several who took first positions in their boards.\nShe said that the Kafaalat Programme remains the backbone of BISP, providing regular cash support to the poorest households.\nThe administrative cost of the entire programme is just one percent, while the remaining 99 percent goes directly to beneficiaries.\nConcluding her remarks, Senator Rubina Khalid said the Pakistan People’s Party has always respected state institutions and sought to strengthen them.\nShe reaffirmed that BISP, through its multiple initiatives, is not only serving millions of underprivileged families but also carrying forward the vision of Benazir Bhutto for an inclusive and dignified society.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
