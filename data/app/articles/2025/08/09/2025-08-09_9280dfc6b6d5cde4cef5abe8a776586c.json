The authority will also upgrade existing football and cricket grounds, add paddle courts, and enhance pedestrian bridges in sports and recreational areas.\n\nRandhawa stressed that transparency and quality will be maintained throughout the project. “Every development initiative will undergo third-party audits. Our goal is to make Islamabad a model capital where sports, recreation, and urban development go hand in hand,” he said.\n\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
