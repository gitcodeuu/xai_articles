Omar Matoug, and Aamir Zareef Khan (SEVP & Company Secretary, Pak-Libya Holding Company).\nWelcoming the delegation, the Chairman highlighted the decades-long partnership between Pakistan and Libya, strengthened by the establishment of the Pak-Libya Holding Company in 1978.\nHe commended the recent turnaround of the institution under its new leadership, noting its stronger governance framework, diversified investment portfolio, and enhanced role in SME, renewable energy, and private sector financing.\nJehad Jamal Al-Buragh, Director-designate of LAFICO, expressed appreciation to the Chairman Senate for giving priority to the meeting, noting that it reflected the importance Pakistan attaches to bilateral economic relations.\nHe reaffirmed that LAFICO remains strongly focused on Pakistan, is actively exploring new avenues of growth, and is committed to synergizing investments between the two countries.\nTariq Mahmood, CFA, Managing Director & CEO of Pak-Libya Holding Company, briefed the Chairman that the institution is now moving on a positive trajectory after a successful turnaround, and is once again focused on its original mandate as a Development Finance Institution.\nHe highlighted that Pak-Libya is now working to synergise investors from both Pakistan and Libya, creating joint opportunities in priority sectors.\nHe further informed that delegations from the textile and pharmaceutical sectors are already engaged, and that a road show is being planned to attract wider participation and investment interest. In addition to project financing, Libya’s Central Bank reserves could be beneficially placed with the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), thereby reinforcing Pakistan’s fiscal buffers and reflecting Libya’s confidence in bilateral financial cooperation.\nHe also paid tribute to the contribution of Libyan board members of Pak-Libya Holding Company in corporate governance, investment strategy, and risk management, particularly through their leadership of the Audit and Risk Committees.\nBoth sides underlined the importance of taking practical steps to enhance cooperation in renewable energy, agriculture value chains, IT and fintech, and Islamic banking.
