Offering fateha at multiple sites, she extended her condolences to the bereaved and assured them of continued support.\nThe Chairperson also visited Pir Baba shrine, which had been completely submerged, and a local Gurdwara where she met members of the Sikh community and expressed solidarity with them.\nEmphasizing dignity in relief operations, Senator Rubina Khalid urged rescue teams and NGOs to avoid showmanship while helping victims. Locals also presented her with a list of nearly 100 deceased persons, which she directed officials to verify and include in future relief packages.\nHighlighting environmental concerns, she cautioned residents about the dangers of plastic pollution, noting its role in climate change. She personally joined a cleanliness drive alongside locals and BISP staff to collect plastic waste.\nAt the Swat Press Club, where a BISP Mobile Registration Vehicle (MRV) had been deployed, Senator Rubina Khalid monitored ongoing surveys and registration of new beneficiaries. She personally observed women’s registration and recertification processes.\nShe also visited a medical camp, handed over medicines, and met doctors and volunteers, appreciating their dedicated services.
