Through an engaging dialogue, she inspired the girls to become informed leaders and reminded them that “the climate crisis will define your generation, but your response to it can define your legacy.”\nSaaremeen Fatima, Program Manager for Youth Development at FGP, who led the session, said that this session was about more than just gathering data — it was about listening to voices that are often overlooked. The energy, curiosity, and leadership potential these girls displayed were extraordinary.\nThe Principal of TLS praised the initiative, stating: “We are deeply grateful to Freedom Gate Prosperity for bringing this vision to our students. The session opened up a new world of possibilities, allowing our girls to voice their hopes and learn about real skills that can transform their lives. We look forward to a long-term partnership that enriches education with relevance and impact.”\nAdding a strategic and values-based perspective, Muhammad Anwar, CEO of FGP, emphasized: “This initiative reflects the urgent need to reframe education in Pakistan, where learning must prepare young girls not just for exams, but for life, livelihoods, and leadership. Climate resilience and economic empowerment are no longer optional — they are essential. Our girls must be equipped to navigate environmental challenges and shape sustainable futures for their communities.”\nFGP extended its heartfelt gratitude to Afia Salam for her impactful contribution to this session and to the TLS principal and team for their vision, hospitality, and enthusiastic partnership.\nThe session marked the beginning of a dynamic partnership focused on skill development, climate awareness, and youth-led innovation among adolescent girls in rural Punjab.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
