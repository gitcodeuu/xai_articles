WHO and the Ministry of Health convened the national and international experts for a discussion.\nKamal said,  “This is a commitment. I, along with my entire team, will work day and night, and we will leave no stone unturned to achieve our target.”\nHe said,”  Millions of people are already affected, and many more are getting affected every single day. We must act now to save our people.”\n“The fight against hepatitis is not a job, but a passion, a commitment and a mission. We have to screen our population.”\nAccording to data presented during the event, the implementation of the Prime Minister Programme could save 150,000 lives and avoid 210,000 infections by 2030, preventing 90,000 liver cancer cases and 71,000 cirrhosis cases.\nThis prevention will also save over the next five years 1.3 billion Pakistani rupees (PKR) (USD 4.6 million) in treatment and over PKR 2 billion (USD 7 million) in hospitalization costs, totaling savings of PKR 3.3 billion.\nWHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo said, “Detecting and treating hepatitis is essential, but prevention is the key to end the disease.”\nHe said, ” We will continue to partner with Pakistan to implement science-based approaches and adapt to the Pakistani context best practices and lessons learned from around the world.”\nWith 10 million of the 50 million estimated cases worldwide, Pakistan has the heaviest burden of hepatitis C globally.\nIt is estimated that, every year, 110,000 people are infected in the country as 62% due to unsafe medical injections (including blood transfusions) and 38% due to injection drug use.\n“WHO reiterates its full support for Pakistan’s efforts to fight the disease, including the Prime Minister’s National Programme for the Elimination of Hepatitis C Infection.”\nThe Programme aims to test 50% of the eligible population (82.5 million people aged 12 years and above) and treat five million people by 2027.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
