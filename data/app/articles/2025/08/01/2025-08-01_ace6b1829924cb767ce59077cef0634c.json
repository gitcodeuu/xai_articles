It aims to reduce environmental pollution and enhance urban aesthetics through sustainable development.\n\nAs part of the initiative, old railway carriages will be converted into libraries and cafes, adding a cultural and recreational dimension to the corridor.\n\nThe project has been divided into four development packages: Shahdara to Railway Station, Walton, Walton to Kot Lakhpat, and Raiwind.\n\nThe Housing Department of Punjab has submitted the PC-1 of the project to the Planning and Development Department for formal approval.
