Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah lauded the unity and courage of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and other patriotic forces, which contributed decisively to the global fight against fascism.\nDeputy Speaker NA also noted that, although Pakistan had not yet gained independence during the war, thousands of soldiers from present-day Pakistan served in the British Indian Army and fought in the Burma Campaign, easing pressure on Chinese fronts and reflecting the deep-rooted historical ties between the peoples of Pakistan and China.\nHighlighting the evolution of Pakistan–China relations into a comprehensive strategic partnership described as “higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea”, he emphasised that the two nations share more than geography, with their histories marked by struggles against colonial domination and their foreign policies anchored in mutual respect, non-interference, and sovereignty.\nWhile pointing to the transformative role of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor under the Belt and Road Initiative, Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah reaffirmed that Pakistan and China have consistently stood by each other in times of natural disasters, pandemics, and other challenges, offering unwavering support and solidarity.\nHe stressed that this commemoration is not only about remembering the past but also about upholding peace and justice in today’s complex global environment. “We must learn from history. Militarism, unilateralism, and the glorification of violence lead only to suffering,” he stated, adding that in the face of modern challenges such as pandemics, climate change, economic instability, and rising extremism, cooperation and dialogue remain the only viable path forward.\nChinese Ambassador was also present  on the occasion.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
