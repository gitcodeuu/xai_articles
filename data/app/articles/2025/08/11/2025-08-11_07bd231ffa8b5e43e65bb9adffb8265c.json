Each scholar was given 10 minutes to comprehensively defend their topics. Education experts raised questions on academic, research, and technical aspects, which the scholars answered in detail.\nThe Dean of the Faculty of Social Sciences, Professor Dr. Abdul Aziz Sahir, instructed scholars to further refine their proposals from technical, intellectual, literary, and thematic perspectives to ensure they meet high standards. Several synopses were returned for revision with constructive suggestions, while the majority were approved by the Faculty Board.\nOn the second day (Tuesday), another 16 scholars will present their synopses.
