Children with undiagnosed genetic eye conditions often face delayed schooling, limited mobility, and social isolation, factors that compound over time to restrict their economic potential.\nIn rural areas, where access to specialized care is even more limited, families frequently rely on informal remedies or remain unaware that the condition may be inherited and preventable.\nIn Pakistan, where marriages within the family are common, the risk of inherited disorders is significantly higher. However, genetic testing is virtually unavailable in public hospitals due to a lack of laboratory infrastructure and trained personnel.\nConsequently, many children receive a diagnosis only after irreversible vision loss, affecting their education and future productivity.\nTo address this gap, Al-Shifa Trust now offers free genetic testing for patients referred through its hospital network, a service that typically costs around Rs100,000 per person.\nSince the department was launched, “We have analyzed a select group of complex cases – each requiring intensive DNA sequencing – to identify hereditary patterns and build a growing national genetic database,” Dr Afghani said.\nAl-Shifa Trust urges families with children suffering from unexplained or congenital vision problems to seek evaluation promptly.\nEarly genetic diagnosis not only improves clinical outcomes but also reduces the long-term financial and emotional toll of blindness on individuals and society.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
