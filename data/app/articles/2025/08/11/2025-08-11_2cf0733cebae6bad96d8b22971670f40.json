The initiative sought to encourage citizens to take responsibility for their surroundings and to adopt sustainable practices in daily life, said a press release on Monday.\nSpeaking on the occasion SSDO Executive Director Syed Kausar Abbas said that independence is incomplete without the commitment to protect the country’s environment.\nHe remarked that our freedom comes with the responsibility to safeguard our land, our water and our air.
