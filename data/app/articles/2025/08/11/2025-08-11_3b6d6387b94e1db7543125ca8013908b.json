  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 11 (APP):Pakistan was a responsible nuclear weapon state with an elaborate command and control structure under full civilian control and had always exercised discipline and restraint, while dealing with the issues of such importance, Foreign Office Spokesperson said in a statement on Monday.\nHe was responding to a statement made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).\nResponding to media queries regarding the statement made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) on the remarks attributed to Pakistan’s Chief of Army Staff, the Spokesperson said: “Pakistan strongly rejects the immature remarks made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs earlier today, which is yet another demonstration of their chronic tendency to distorting facts and twisting statements out of context.”\n“The Indian narrative of an alleged nuclear blackmail is a misleading and self-serving construct. Pakistan remains firmly opposed to the use or threat of use of force. India’s sabre rattling and war mongering whenever confronted, invite unfounded allegations bereft of rationality,” he added.\nHe said, “Pakistan’s sustained and credible counterterrorism efforts are internationally-acknowledged.”\n“Our security forces remain the bulwark against terrorism. The Indian MEA’s spurious insinuations are irresponsible and without a shred of evidence,” he noted.\nHe said, “We also note with concern a pointless reference to the third countries, in a bid to exert pressure on Pakistan. This not only reflects India’s lack of diplomatic confidence but also constitutes a futile attempt to unnecessarily involve other countries.”\nHe said contrary to India’s belligerent and jingoistic approach, Pakistan shall continue to act as a responsible member of the comity of nations.\n“However, any act of Indian aggression or violation of Pakistan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity will be met with an immediate and matching response. The onus of any ensuing escalation will rest squarely with the Indian leadership,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
