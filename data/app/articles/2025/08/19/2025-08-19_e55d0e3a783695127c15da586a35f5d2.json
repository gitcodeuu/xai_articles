So far, security clearance of 585 companies has been completed, while 95 new companies submitted their documents during the latest extension, he added.\nHe further informed that existing companies can submit their documents until August 31, while new applicants will remain eligible to apply until September 10.\n“The registration certificates of Ziyarat companies that fulfill all requirements will be issued soon,” the spokesperson confirmed, urging prospective organizers to complete their documentation at the earliest.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
