He added that the situation had turned dire: schools, hospitals and entire neighborhoods had been swept away and the fate of many missing ones remained unknown.\nIftikhar Wali stated that rescue operations were underway by various government organizations including the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) youth wing. He urged philanthropists to come forward and contribute toward relief operations.\nExpressing deep sorrow over those who lost their lives or are missing, he called on the KP government to let the political differences set aside and focus on serving the public during this crisis with mutual efforts.\nHe assured full federal support, noting that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had called the KP’s Chief Minister for full support and maximum coordination from the federation for relief activities and the rehabilitation process.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
