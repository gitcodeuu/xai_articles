If it ignores ecosystems and sidelines communities, it will do more harm than good. Ecotourism is the way forward because it keeps the balance between people, culture and nature,” he said.\nParticipants engaged in a lively interactive discussion on how to practically integrate ecotourism in their respective regions. Many agreed with Ahmed’s view that communities must be made central to tourism planning and benefit-sharing.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
