Besides, millions of homeless and landless people were  forced to occupy banks of  water lanes, rivers and streams and flood areas or mountain ridges during the last hundred years to construct houses risking life against such natural calamities.\nHe appealed to the government and relief organizations to implement a robust plan of lending complete help to the sufferers of the latest flash floods. He hoped that the government and the UN agencies would join hands to work out the United Nations global warming plan in the country .\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
