The initiative is limited to upgrading the existing ground,” the Authority said.\nResponding to concerns about environmental impact, CDA officials noted that no green areas or family spaces will be disturbed.\nInstead, the project includes additional landscaping, improved turf management, and measures to further enhance greenery. Children’s play areas and family recreational zones will remain unaffected.\nThe Authority also reassured citizens that the project poses no new security or accessibility risks. “F-9 Park remains open, safe, and fully accessible to the public during and after the upgradation,” the statement added.\nOfficials said the purpose of the initiative is to provide Islamabad residents with a world-class cricketing and recreational facility within the existing infrastructure of F-9 Park.\nThe CDA reaffirmed its commitment to safeguarding the city’s natural beauty while improving recreational opportunities for citizens.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
