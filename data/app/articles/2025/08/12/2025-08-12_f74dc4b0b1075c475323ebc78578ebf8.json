The government is supporting such initiatives through new cultural policies, provincial engagement, and public awareness campaigns to strengthen the bond between people and their heritage”, he said.\nThe exhibition, coinciding with Pakistan’s 78th Independence Day celebrations, features breathtaking works by acclaimed wildlife artists Ahsan Qureshi and Kamran Qureshi.\nThe displayed paintings depict iconic national wildlife, including the snow leopard, Markhor, and Chakkor, symbolizing the country’s biodiversity and cultural identity.\nArtist Kamran Qureshi shared, “Having spent our lives together in the wilderness, we’ve learned to appreciate the harmony of all creation. We hope our canvases inspire others to preserve and protect this precious beauty.”\nAhsan Qureshi expressed concern over environmental degradation, saying, “It is distressing to see pristine environments deteriorate. Our works aim to capture nature at its best to spark a sense of responsibility in preserving what remains for future generations.”\nPNCA has also organized a wood-carving workshop with a pocket knife by Kamran Qureshi, aimed at engaging youth and artists in creative practices that promote wildlife appreciation and conservation.\nThe exhibition will remain open until August 22 daily, excluding Saturdays and public holidays.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
