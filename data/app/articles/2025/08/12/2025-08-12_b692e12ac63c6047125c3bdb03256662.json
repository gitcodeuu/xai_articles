  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 12 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday warned India that any attempt to block Pakistan’s water in violation of the Indus Waters Treaty would be met with a decisive response.\n“You threaten to stop our water. If you attempt such a move, Pakistan will teach you a lesson you will never forget,” the prime minister said while addressing an event held here in connection with International Youth Day.\nHe emphasized that water was a lifeline for Pakistan, and no compromise would be made on the country’s rights under international agreements.\nThe prime minister said that a “new Pakistan” had emerged after the armed forces of Pakistan defeated India May 10.\nHe said India’s pride was sunk on May 10 when the Pakistan Air Force downed six Indian fighter jets. He called it a historic moment for Pakistan.\nPM Shehbaz announced that 100,000 laptops would be distributed interest-free to students purely on merit. “This government believes in transparency and merit, and we will ensure both in the distribution process,” he assured.\nThe prime minister said that the country’s future was in the hands of youth, reaffirming his government’s commitment to empowering youth through education and technology.\nDuring his address, PM Shehbaz also congratulated the nation on Independence Day and praised the role of minorities and all segments of society in the creation and development of Pakistan.\nMinister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Sardar Muhammad Yousaf said the government was taking effective measures for the protection of minorities. All citizens have equal rights as per the Constitution, he said adding that “To ensure representation, the government has formulated a policy to promote interfaith harmony. Under this policy, minorities will be granted a 5% quota in jobs”.\nMinister of State for Religious Affairs Khel Das Kohistani said Islam respects all other religions, and Pakistan’s Constitution also protects the rights of all people, regardless of their faith. “The Prime Minister is taking the country forward in line with the vision of the founder of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah,” he said.\nChairman PM Youth Program Rana Mashhood Khan said Pakistan’s first youth policy was introduced in 2011 by the then Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Under this initiative, laptops, soft loans, and scholarships were provided to talented students across the province.\nThe Punjab Educational Endowment Fund (PEEF) was also launched by Shehbaz Sharif, he said adding that today, it had evolved into the Pakistan Education Endowment Fund, which benefits students from all over the country. “Every child in Pakistan can benefit from this initiative.”",
