  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 13 (APP):Member of Planning Commission and Vice Chancellor of Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) Dr Muhammad Nadeem Javaid said the Ministry of Planning has so far rolled out 286 projects under the ‘URAAN Pakistan’ Initiative aimed at transforming the country into a $1 trillion economy by 2035 and a $3 trillion economy by 2047.\nThe projects have been formulated at the federal level under the 5Es Framework and were complemented by parallel initiatives from provincial departments, he told Wealth Pakistan.\nThe programme seeks to align national development priorities with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) while strategically mobilizing resources from both the public and private sectors.\nHe said the initiative has moved from the conceptual stage to the initial implementation phase, with multiple interventions designed to activate the framework’s key growth drivers.\nHe said right now, things were being rolled out, adding many projects have been conceived, and provincial governments are actively involved.\nDr Nadeem said the projects span diverse sectors, including infrastructure, human capital development, agriculture, and technological innovation.\nHe said federal and provincial governments were working in coordination to ensure interventions are targeted, scalable and capable of delivering measurable outcomes.\nHe emphasized that although the government was playing a facilitating role in launching these interventions, the private sector’s participation will be crucial for their long-term success.\nHe stressed the role of the private sector was much more important than that of the government. For the private sector, macroeconomic stability and policy continuity are essential.\nThe 5Es Framework, which is central to the URAAN Pakistan initiative, focuses on five strategic drivers to foster inclusive growth, innovation and resilience.\nBy integrating these drivers with the SDGs, the government aims to create a development roadmap that addresses both immediate national priorities and long-term global commitments.\nDr Nadeem highlighted that small but targeted interventions were being prioritized to catalyze broader structural transformation.\nThese efforts are aimed at building momentum, attracting investment, and strengthening institutional capacity.\nHe suggested that a strong emphasis on public-private partnerships, coupled with policy stability, could significantly boost investor confidence and accelerate development.\nHe maintained that the initiative is not just a policy document, but a practical plan that is already being implemented.\nThe federal government has unveiled the Rs17 trillion URAAN Pakistan five-year development plan, which is aimed at achieving economic self-sufficiency.\nThe federal share will be Rs7 trillion, while the provinces will contribute Rs10 trillion.\nFor FY2025–26, the development budget is set at Rs4.2 trillion, including Rs1 trillion under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
