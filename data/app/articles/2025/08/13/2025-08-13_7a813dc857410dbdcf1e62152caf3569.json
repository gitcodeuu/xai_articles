A prominent step in this regard was a significant cut in the rates of electricity, which had provided an across the board relief to the general public and industries.\n“As a Prime Minister, I particularly express my commitment that the government is utilizing all resources to make the country effectively meet the new economic, industrial technological demands of the present era,” he added.\nApart from these policies and programmes, he said the main source of strength behind the progress of Pakistan was their unity.\n“Like military prowess, a strong and stable economy is also inevitable for an impregnable national defence and sovereignty, for which we all need to demonstrate the spirit of Marka-e-Haq and the Pakistan Movement,” he added.",
