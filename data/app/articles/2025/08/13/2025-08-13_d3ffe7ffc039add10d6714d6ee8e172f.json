A special ceremony is also planned at Shakarparian.\nCongratulating the entire nation on both Independence Day and the victory in the Maarka-e-Haq, Tarar said this historic occasion symbolized Pakistan’s unity, resolve, and courage.\nIn response to a question, he said a consultative meeting of the PML-N regarding the upcoming by-elections had taken place in Murree.\nHe noted that Senior Punjab Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb was abroad and did not attend the meeting, as one of her brothers is contesting from a constituency.",
