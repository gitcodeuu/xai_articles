In the wake of recent turbulence, I laud the resolve of our Armed Forces and our people who stood together to safeguard our sovereignty. This collective resilience reflects not only formidable military readiness but also a principled foreign policy that has earned widespread international support,” he remarked.\nThe deputy prime minister said that the celebration of independence day and Marka-e-Haq was a reminder to the fact that freedom was preserved not only by defending country’s borders but also by upholding the principles of truth, justice, and dignity in international engagements.\n“Our foreign policy will continue to project Pakistan as a responsible, peace-loving nation—ready to build partnerships, resolve disputes through dialogue, and play an active role in shaping a stable and prosperous region,” Deputy Prime Minister Dar said calling on every fellow citizen to remain united, protect democratic values, and collectively contribute to building a strong, dignified, and prosperous Pakistan — for today and times to come.",
