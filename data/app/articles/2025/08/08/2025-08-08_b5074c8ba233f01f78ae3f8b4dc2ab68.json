This is the architecture for an inclusive and tech-driven agricultural transformation under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s Digital Nation Pakistan, in collaboration with Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC),” she noted.\n\nDG LIMS, Maj General (R) M Ayub Ahsan Bhatti also addressed the platform and highlighted the significance concentrated by this momentous initiative. He specified that Agri-Stack/PAKGROW is an exceptional concept that will innovate the Agricultural Arena of Pakistan by transforming and improving the lives of small farmers and convening policymaking.\n\nCEO LIMS, Dr M Waqar Yasin, accentuated that LIMS, being the technical backbone of the initiative, will serve as the Central Agency and National Agri Database for Pakistan by amalgamating data from multiple streams to generate Farm Specific information relevant to cater to the needs of key stakeholders.\n\nCEO Ignite, Rafique Ahmed Buriro, supported the Federal Minister’s and DG LIMS’ remarks and reaffirmed the commitment to building open, secure, and scalable digital infrastructure, positioning Agri Stack as the backbone of sustainable and innovative agri-solutions across the country.\n\nFoundational components include farmer digital IDs and registries, consent-based data exchange, trusted payment rails, satellite-driven crop intelligence, and digital market platforms.\n\nThe consultation aimed to align stakeholders on governance and fast-track implementation through LIMS. Participants endorsed the formation of a Steering Committee co-chaired by MoITT and MNFSR, a Technical Working Group on data and cybersecurity and pilot squads from the public and private sectors.\n\nOver the next 12–18 months, the initiative will prioritize use cases such as smart input subsidies, weather-indexed crop insurance, credit access through alternative data, and market linkages through LIMS. The session concluded with a clear roadmap for establishing working groups, launching 3–4 pilot projects and setting measurable milestones for a digitally empowered agricultural future.\n\nThe Agri Stack represents a critical step in reimagining agriculture as a digitally enabled ecosystem, empowering farmers, enhancing transparency and boosting economic resilience. The Ministry of IT reaffirmed its commitment to driving innovation and collaboration for a sustainable agricultural future.",
