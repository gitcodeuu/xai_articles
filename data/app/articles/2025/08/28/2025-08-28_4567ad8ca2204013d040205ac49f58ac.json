The SSGCL representative informed the Committee that the work would be completed by October this year, improving gas supply in the affected areas.\nThe meeting was attended by Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, MNAs Asiya Ishaque Siddique, Raja Qamar ul Islam, Shagufta Jummani, Shahida Rehmani, Hameed Hussain, Muneeba Iqbal, Syed Javed Ali Shah Jillani, Sofia Saeed Shah, as well as secretaries of the concerned ministries and senior officials of relevant departments.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
