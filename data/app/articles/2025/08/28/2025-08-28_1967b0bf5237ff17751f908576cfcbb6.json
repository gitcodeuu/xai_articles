A discharge ranging between 650,000 to 700,000 cusecs has been forecast, raising the risk of widespread inundation. Authorities have been directed to evacuate residents from nearby low-lying zones, while emergency teams remain on standby to manage the anticipated deluge.\nEvacuation directives have been issued for potentially affected districts including Hafizabad, Chiniot, Multan, Punjnad and Bahawalpur, while authorities may use the left bank area of 18-Hazari along the Chenab River as a breaching site to mitigate the expected flood situation.\nAccording to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), a rapid surge has been recorded in the Ravi River, with a high flood ranging from 150,029 to 200,000 cusecs expected at Balloki Barrage by 7:00 AM on August 29.\nThe flood wave is anticipated to reach Sadhnai by September 1, where flows between 125,000 and 150,000 cusecs may pose a serious inundation threat to surrounding areas.\nAuthorities have placed multiple regions on high alert due to the risk of flooding.\nIn Lahore, high-risk union councils include Shahdara, Kot Mahbo, Jia Moosa, Aziz Colony, Qaiser Town, Faisal Park, Dheer, and Kot Begum.\nIn Sheikhupura and Ferozewala, vulnerable areas include Faizpur Khoo, Dhameke, Daka, Burj Atari, and Kot Abdul Malik.
