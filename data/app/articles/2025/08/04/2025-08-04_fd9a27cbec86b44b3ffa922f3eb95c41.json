  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 04 (APP): Federal Minister for Information Technology and Telecommunication Shaza Fatima Khawaja said Monday that providing fast and uninterrupted internet is among the government’s top priorities, especially as internet usage in Pakistan has increased by 25% over the past year.\n\nSpeaking at the launch of TikTok’s STEM Feed, the minister said hat 5G services would soon be introduced in Pakistan. She emphasized the importance of high-speed internet, stating that it is essential for the country’s development.\n\nHighlighting the rapid growth of Pakistan’s IT sector, she called for responsible and ethical use of technology in all areas of life. “Technology is now part of every field. We must use it wisely and positively,” she said.\n\nAddressing the youth, she encouraged them to keep learning and to use digital platforms for sharing knowledge. “A single person can create change in education and jobs through technology,” she said.\n\nAcknowledging TikTok’s widespread use across different sections of society, she said the platform follows Pakistan’s local laws. “We have strong working relations with TikTok,” she added.\n\nShe said the government aims to use TikTok as a tool to promote learning, especially through STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) content.\n\nShe praised the collaboration between TikTok, the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, and the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme.\n\nShaza Fatima also recognized the role of media in spreading awareness about technology and urged young people to use online platforms responsibly and guide others as well. “These platforms can help the country grow if used responsibly,” she said.\n\nThe minister announced that new legislation has been passed to provide every citizen with a digital identity. Through the Digital Pakistan Act, all governance, data, and services will be available through a single digital platform. “Every citizen will have a digital identity,” she said.\n\nReferring to past achievements, she said that 4G services were launched during former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s government in 2014. Now, a new spectrum auction is planned to improve 3G and 4G services and to roll out 5G, with a target of reaching 550 MHz.\n\nShe said the National Fiberization Plan will expand optic fiber connectivity across Pakistan, making the internet more stable and faster.\n\nShe also shared that one of the largest new submarine cables has already reached Pakistan and will become operational by the end of this year.

She also noted that women’s limited access to financial resources remains a key challenge.\n\nShaza Fatima said that over 1.2 million laptops have been distributed so far under the current government.
