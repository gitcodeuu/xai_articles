The same was also notified\n\nto the Directorates of Education and FBISE-affiliated institutions. As a result, a total of 528 students from across Pakistan registered for the Pakistan Olympiad in Informatics (POI).\n\nFBISE successfully conducted two rigorous rounds of nationwide testing to identify and select the\n\nmost outstanding young programmers. The first round of Pakistan Olympiad in Informatics\n\n(POI) was held at 12 examination centers across the country, including Lahore, Karachi, Quetta,\n\nMultan, Peshawar, Gilgit-Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Rawalpindi, and Islamabad.\n\nAfter a tough competition, 25 students were shortlisted, culminating in the final selection of the top four performers.\n\nThe following four shining stars represented Pakistan at International Olympiad in Informatics\n\n(IOI) 2025 and each secured a bronze medal, Muhammad Aneeq, Ghulam Junaid, Muhammad Saram and Ahmed Imran Malik.\n\nThis landmark success underscores the merit-based, transparent selection process implemented by FBISE. It is a testament to the untapped potential and brilliance of Pakistan’s youth in computer science and informatics.\n\nFBISE extended heartfelt congratulations to the students, their families, mentors, and partner institutions for their dedication and excellence that have brought international recognition and immense pride to the nation.\n\nThis victory not only marks a milestone in Pakistan’s journey in international informatics but also reflects the growing emphasis on STEM education and youth empowerment in the country.",
