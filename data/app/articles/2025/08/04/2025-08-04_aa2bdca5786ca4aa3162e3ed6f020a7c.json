During these operations, several retailers were found either overcharging or refusing to sell sugar, claiming unavailability.\n\nOfficials confirmed that 35 shops were sealed and four persons arrested in one day alone.\n\nDeputy Commissioner Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon, said the government is making sure that sugar is supplied to retailers at wholesale market rates. He added that action is being taken against those who falsely claim shortage or withhold stock to create artificial price hikes.\n\nTo streamline sugar availability, a focal person has been appointed to oversee and ensure timely supply to retailers.\n\nIrfan Memon stated that sugar sale stalls are also operating across the city where citizens can buy sugar at Rs172 per kilogram.\n\nHe urged residents not to purchase sugar at inflated prices and to report such incidents to the administration.\n\n“Public cooperation is essential. We request citizens to inform us about retailers who are overcharging or hoarding stock,” the Deputy Commissioner said.\n\nThe administration’s focus remains on stabilizing sugar prices and ensuring that it is available to all segments of the population at the notified rates.\n\nMeanwhile, the market monitoring will continue in the coming days. Officials are expected to conduct surprise visits to curb any attempt to manipulate sugar supply or pricing.\n\nThe district administration has reiterated its commitment to keep basic commodities within reach of the public and said that violators will face strict legal action.\n\nAuthorities have warned traders to follow government pricing rules or risk fines, shop closures, or legal proceedings.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner has asked the public to use the helpline and other complaint channels to report violations.\n\nThe district government has also started collecting data on the daily sugar demand and supply trends to address possible gaps and prevent stock manipulation.\n\nDC Memon assured that efforts will continue until fair pricing is ensured across the city.",
