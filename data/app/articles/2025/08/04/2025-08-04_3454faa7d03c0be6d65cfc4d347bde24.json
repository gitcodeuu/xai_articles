He said killing, torture and arrest have never weakened our freedom sentiments for which innumerable sacrifices have been rendered in the length and breadth of Kashmir. He said the peaceful movement will continue till it reaches its logical conclusion.\n\nThe Hurriyat leaders urged the international community to take some tangible steps and use their good offices to stress upon India for the early resolution of the Kashmir issue. He said it was unfortunate that the world community closed its eyes when it comes to the atrocities of forces being committed against the innocent and unarmed people of Kashmir.\n\nHe said the people of Kashmir will continue to fight with tooth and nail for the resolution of the Kashmir issue until the dawn of Freedom is not witnessed in the Kashmir valley so that we can also breathe in a free atmosphere.\n\nHe said it was high time for the Indian government to shun its stubborn approach and take concrete steps for the resolution of the Kashmir issue so that the life and property of the people of Kashmir could be saved from getting more devastated due to the lingering issue of Kashmir.",
