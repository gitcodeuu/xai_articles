This facility has been started from the Pakistani embassy in London, which will soon be extended to other countries where a large number of Pakistanis live.\nHe added that this initiative will save overseas Pakistanis from the hassle of coming to Pakistan, taking long vacations and going through the rounds of patwaris. Earlier, most people were forced to give Power of Attorney, which was misused and they lost their savings.\nChaudhry Tariq Subhani further said that PLRA has introduced an international standard system, in which an ownership audit trail of each person will be kept.\nIn this process, a “green certificate” will be issued after verification of the citizen and verification of the land through NADRA. Through this green certificate, the buyer will be able to get satisfaction that the property is legally protected and there will be no problems like possession or identification.\nHe said that properties with which NADRA identity records are not linked are also being brought into the system and after official verification, green certificates will also be issued to these properties. This step is making the process of buying and selling properties transparent, safe and easy.\nPresident Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SCCI) Ikram-ul-Haq, in his address congratulated Chaudhry Tariq Subhani on becoming the Chairman of PLRA and said that under his leadership, the problems faced in buying and selling property will be eliminated.\nPresident SCCI expressed the hope that now the common man will also be able to buy and sell property without fear and will not be a victim of any kind of fraud.\nAdditional Director General Farooq Akmal said that the government will provide satisfaction through the green certificate. There will be a geo-tag barcode on the certificate. This will increase the value of the land\nThe meeting was attended by Member Provincial Assembly (MPA) Chaudhry Faisal Ikram, Additional Director (ADC) General Farooq Akmal, relevant authorities and members of the Chamber of Commerce in large numbers.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
