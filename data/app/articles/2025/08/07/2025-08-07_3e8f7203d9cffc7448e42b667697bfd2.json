Mr. Sohail Ahmed Mashori, Additional Resident Secretary, Law and Justice Commission of Pakistan (LJCP), was also present during the meeting.\n\nAccording to a press note released here Thursday, the CJP noted that the Government is actively engaged in addressing the infrastructural requirements of the judiciary in line with contemporary standards. Given Karachi’s status as the economic hub of Pakistan, he underscored the urgency of establishing a judicial infrastructure that can meet the city’s expanding legal and commercial demands.\n\nTo improve coordination and implementation of reforms, he said the Additional Resident Secretary in each province to serve as a liaison entity with the district judiciary. This initiative aims to bridge the gaps through meaningful collaboration between the bench and bar.\n\nThe visiting representatives expressed their appreciation to the Chief Justice for his time and for addressing the pressing issues faced by the legal community in Karachi.
