For sectors I and H, traffic may use Rawalpindi Peshawar Road and IJP Road via connecting service roads.\n\nThe route from Murree Road to Serena Hotel and Faizabad via Rawal Dam will remain temporarily closed during the delegation’s movement, the official added.\n\nChief Traffic Officer (CTO) Captain (R) Syed Zeeshan Haider said traffic wardens have been deployed at key locations to assist and guide commuters throughout the day.\n\nCTO Zeeshan urged citizens to allow an additional 20 minutes of travel time and to stay updated through ITP’s social media platforms.
