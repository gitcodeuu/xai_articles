He noted that diplomatic and economic initiatives of this nature are vital for revitalizing exports and attracting foreign direct investment.

We must now focus on compliance, innovation, and diversification to fully capitalize on this success.”\n\nIftikhar Ali Malik termed the development a turning point in Pakistan-U.S. trade relations, opening avenues for mutual growth, employment, and long-term economic stability. He urged Pakistani exporters to seize the opportunity by enhancing product quality and aligning with international standards.",
