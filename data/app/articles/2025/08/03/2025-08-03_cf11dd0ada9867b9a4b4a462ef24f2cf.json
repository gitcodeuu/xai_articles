We do not accept a homeopathic solution, nor any formula that goes against the aspirations of the Kashmiri people and international commitments. We want a final, comprehensive and sustainable solution in which the Kashmiri people are the real parties”, he added.\n\nHe further said that the Hurriyat Conference considers bilateral talks on the Kashmir issue as insufficient and fully supports tripartite talks, in which India, Pakistan as well as the Kashmiri leadership have a central role.\n\nGhulam Muhammad Safi clarified that “When we talk about the right to self-determination, it includes Kashmiri Muslims, Pandits, Sikhs, Christians and Dogras. This is a comprehensive movement that is above religion, race and language.”\n\nHe said that along with political and diplomatic struggle, the Kashmiri people also have the right to military resistance against the illegal Indian occupation under international law.\n\nSenior Hurriyat leaders Muhammad Farooq Rahmani, Advocate Pervaiz Ahmed (General Secretary), and Mushtaq Ahmed Butt (Secretary Information) who were part of the delegation appreciated the efforts of the delegation for the Kashmir issue and said “We are going to organize protests at the global level in the month of August, and we request the Jammu and Kashmir Community International to participate and cooperate fully”.\n\nThe delegation of Jammu and Kashmir Community International said that we stand by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference and we will actively participate in all the activities of the Hurriyat Conference. The delegation assured the Hurriyat leaders of its full support and said that they will devote all their energies to highlighting the Kashmir issue worldwide.\n\nThe delegation expressed regret over the indifference and silence of the international community, especially the Western world, and said the international powers should not only look at economic interests but also fulfill their legal, moral and political responsibilities for the rights of the oppressed Kashmiri people.",
