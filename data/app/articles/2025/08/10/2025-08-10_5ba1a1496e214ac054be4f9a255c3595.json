FIFA’s 2016 reforms also emphasized the importance of women’s full participation in shaping the future of the sport.\nOn the occasion, PFF President Syed Mohsen Gilani said, I am proud to see women taking managerial role in the history of Pakistan football. We believe her presence will inspire more women to take up key roles in football.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
