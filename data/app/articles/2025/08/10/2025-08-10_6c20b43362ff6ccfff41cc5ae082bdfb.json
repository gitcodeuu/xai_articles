  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 10 (APP):: Every summer, as the subcontinent bakes under an unforgiving sun, something quietly ripens in its orchards. From the hot, humid fields of Sindh and Malihabad to the coastal valleys of Ratnagiri, the mango, known as the King of Fruits, returns with its golden glow, sweetening both palates and hearts.\n\nBut beyond being a seasonal delicacy, the mango has long played a refined and surprising role: i) It is the fruit that speaks when politics fall silent, ii) A humble diplomat in straw-lined crates, iii) A golden ambassador that revives stranded relations, and sweetens those already strong.\n\nThe monsoon messenger\n\nEvery year, around the arrival of Sawan, mango crates begin their quiet journey, not just to markets, but to embassies, foreign ministries, presidential residences, and homes of friends and families across borders. Often, these are not mere gifts. They are deeply symbolic gestures—fragrant peace offerings wrapped in jute and tradition.\n\nA tradition rooted in history\n\nMango diplomacy is nothing new. It has shaped soft power exchanges for decades across South Asia and beyond.\n\n1955: During the Cold War era, Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru sent crates of Alphonso mangoes to Soviet leaders in a subtle bid to strengthen ties with Moscow.\n\n1968: Pakistan’s Foreign Minister Mian Arshad Hussain presented a crate of Sindhri mangoes to Chairman Mao Zedong. The gift sparked China’s now-famous Mango Cult, with the fruit becoming a symbol of Mao’s affection for the working class during the Cultural Revolution.\n\n1981: Amid high tension with India, Pakistan’s President Zia-ul-Haq sent crates of Anwar Ratol mangoes to Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The gesture, though small, was widely reported as a move to thaw diplomatic frost.\n\n2022: Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina dispatched one metric tonne of Amrapali mangoes to Indian leaders including President Ram Nath Kovind and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, reinforcing regional friendship through fruit.\n\nMango’s roots: A 4,000-year-old legacy\n\nBelieved to have been cultivated in South Asia more than 4,000 years ago, the mango has traveled through ancient trade routes and empires—from Buddhist monks planting groves in the 4th century BCE, to Mughal emperors breeding royal varieties in their palace gardens. Today, it is a shared heritage fruit among countries that often find little else in common.\n\nMore than a fruit: A cultural bond\n\nFor millions across the subcontinent, the mango is not just a fruit, it’s a season, a memory, a shared joy. It evokes long, sticky summers, mango juice dripping down chins, school holidays, and monsoon meals. To give a mango is to share something sacred: family, identity, abundance. In every bite lies something ancestral.\n\nA fruit that nourishes, not just charms\n\nBeyond diplomacy and culture, the mango is a nutritional powerhouse of Vitamin C that boosts immunity, Vitamin A supports skin and eye health, Antioxidants & fiber that aid digestion and fight inflammation. Just one cup of mango offers nearly 70% of the daily Vitamin C requirement—making it as good for your health as it is for your heart.\n\nGlobal Varieties and Sweet Influencers\n\nMangoes come in hundreds of varieties worldwide, each with its own fanbase. Top five Mango varieties loved around the world are: 1) Alphonso (India): Saffron-colored, silky texture, sweet aroma, 2) Sindhri (Pakistan): Large, juicy, early-season favorite, 3) Nam Dok Mai (Thailand): Slender, golden, intensely aromatic, 4) Keitt (Egypt/USA): Green-skinned, tangy-sweet, and fiberless, 5) Miyazaki (Japan): Deep red, incredibly sweet, and extremely rare.\n\nAt the luxury end of the market, Japan’s Miyazaki mangoes are the world’s most expensive, selling for up to $4,000 a pair. Cultivated under precise conditions, they’re less a fruit and more a luxury statement.\n\nMango giants: The world’s top producers\n\nAccording to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the five biggest mango-producing countries include India, China, Thailand, Indonesia, and Pakistan. Together, they account for over 75% of the world’s mango supply.\n\nA golden future for fruit-led diplomacy\n\nWhile policies may freeze and borders may close, the mango continues to quietly cross them, wrapped in straw, kissed by the sun, and welcomed with open arms. As the world navigates rising nationalism and fragile diplomacy, the mango reminds us that sometimes, sweetness can go where strategy can’t. And in the stormy theatre of politics, it remains the softest, and most delicious, diplomat we’ve ever known.",
