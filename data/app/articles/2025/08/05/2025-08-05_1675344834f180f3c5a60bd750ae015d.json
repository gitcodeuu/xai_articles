Referring to the spirit of Bunyanum-Marsoos , he praised the strategic unity and strength of the Pakistani nation and its armed forces in standing shoulder to shoulder with Kashmiris.\n\nHe further declared, “India’s pride was shattered with the downing of the Rafale,” referring to the symbolic blow dealt to India’s military superiority narrative. While official details on any Rafale incident remain unconfirmed, the statement drew attention and applause for representing the sentiment of resistance and defiance.\n\n“Pakistan’s flag flew with pride,” Khan added, “and victories are being discussed across the country — because truth and justice are on Kashmir’s side.”\n\nZamurrad Khan’s remarks echoed the collective national sentiment on Yom-e-Istihsal, marking six years since India’s unilateral revocation of Article 370, which stripped Jammu & Kashmir of its special status under the Indian Constitution.",
