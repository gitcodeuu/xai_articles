India’s unilateral move to revoke the special constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir is a grave violation of international law and basic human rights. Pakistan stands shoulder to shoulder with the Kashmiri people and fully supports their right to self-determination.”\n\nHe emphasized that the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people will not go in vain and reiterated Pakistan’s firm stance that Kashmir will one day become part of Pakistan.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar congratulated Chaudhry Anwarul Haq on successfully organizing Youm-e-Istehsal.",
