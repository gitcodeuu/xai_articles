We remain committed to peace and peaceful coexistence, but no one should misconstrue it as weakness, as we will give a robust response to any aggression,” the deputy prime minister said, addressing a rally held in connection with Youm-e-Istehsal at D Chowk here.\n\nRejecting Indian plans of designating Kashmir as a Union Territory, further consolidating its control, and Indian claims of calling Kashmir an internal matter, he said that as a party to the dispute alongside the Kashmiri people, Pakistan would not accept any Indian unilateral decisions, which also violated the UN resolutions and international norms.\n\nHe recalled that on August 5, 2019, India unilaterally revoked the special status of Jammu and Kashmir under Article 370 of its Constitution, to bring Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) under its direct control.\n\nHe said that in the name of democracy and development, India took draconian measures, including the imposition of a months-long lockdown, restrictions on public movement, and the suspension of fundamental rights. Political leaders were imprisoned, and access to communication and freedom of expression was curtailed, he added.\n\nHe said that India continued to strengthen its control over IIOJK and even the Indian Supreme Court upheld these unilateral actions, disregarding the fact that it was an internationally recognized disputed territory, whose fate could not be decided through domestic laws.\n\nHe said India altered demographic delineations, issued domiciles to non-Kashmiris, and allowed them to purchase property in IIOJK, as an attempt to transform it into a state like any other in India. These actions appear designed to establish a government aligned with New Delhi’s policies, Dar observed.Cultural exchange programs\n\nHe said that Pakistani political parties were united on the Kashmir issue and criticised a political party for announcing demonstrations on the Day to press their demands, calling it an attempt to divide the masses and divert attention from India’s actions.\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Dar reaffirmed that Pakistan would continue its moral, political, and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri people in their struggle for their right to self-determination.\n\nFederal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar said that Pakistan has been  advocating the cause of the Kashmiris at every forum to protest against Indian illegal occupation and expose human rights violations committed by Indian Armed Forces in Kashmir.\n\n“Pakistan will continue its moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris till realisation of goal of freedom”, Attaullah Tarar reiterated the commitment while addressing the participants of the Kashmir Youm-e-Istehsal  rally.\n\nThe minister said that Kashmiri people were not alone in their struggle, the state of Pakistan  and people of Pakistan firmly stood with them.\n\nHe said August 5 was the darkest day in history as on this day, India attempted to illegally usurp Kashmiris fundamental rights by abolishing Article 370 and 35A.\n\nThe minister said that bonds between Kashmiris and Pakistan were eternal which can never be broken by any Indian conspiracy.\n\nHe reminded that dead  bodies of martyred Kashmiris like youth icon Burhan Wani  were wrapped in colour of Pakistan’s flag, which was manifestation of Kashmiris love and affection for Pakistan.\n\nHe said that for past over seven decades in general and after August 5, 2019 India has been committing unprecedented atrocities in the paradise-like valley of Kashmir.\n\nAbout military stand off with India, he said when Indain PM Modi cast  a malicious eye, the Pakistani forces gave him a befitting response.\n\n” India was not only defeated in the military arena, it was also humiliated in the field of narrative and on the diplomatic front” Attaullah  Tarar remarked.\n\nAttaullah Tarar said that the victory in the Ma’arka-e- Haq has boosted the morale of  Kashmiri masses.\n\nPakistan, he assured, will not only continue to raise the voice of its Kashmiri brothers at every forum, God willing, but will also continue to fight for their cause all over the world.Cultural exchange programs\n\nFederal Minister for Kashmir Affairs, Gilgit Baltistan & SAFRON Engr Amir Muqam has urged the international community to play a role in a solid solution to the longstanding Kashmir issue in this region because no peace is possible in the region without a solution to the Kashmir issue.\n\nThe minister said that so so-called world’s largest democratic state, India violating human rights continuously since August 5, 2019 adding that the international community should put pressure on India to curb state terrorism, the continued military siege for the last six years, and other atrocities in IIOJK.\n\nPakistan will not allow India to succeed in its nefarious designs of turning the Muslim majority into the minority in the IIOJK, he added.\n\nA protest rally was taken out from the Foreign Office led by Chairman Kashmir Committee MNA Qasim Noon, to D Chowk.

That day, India scrapped the special status of IIOJK and bifurcated it into two so-called ‘Union Territories’ to alter its internationally recognized disputed status and undermine the right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people.\n\nHurriyat leaders Abdul Hameed Lone, Mohammad Farooq Rahmani, and government representatives participated in the rally.\n\nOne minute’s silence was also observed in memory of the martyrs in Kashmir.",
