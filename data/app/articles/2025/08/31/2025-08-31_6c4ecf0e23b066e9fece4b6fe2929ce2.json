It includes judicial oversight and safeguards to provide recourse against misuse and abuse of power, unlike past arbitrary practices,” President Secretariat Press Wing, on Sunday, said in a press release.\nThe amendment aimed to improve counter-terrorism efforts while ensuring legal oversight and safeguards. This is an important step in addressing Pakistan’s ongoing security challenges, it was further added.",
