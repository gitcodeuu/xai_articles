  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 20 (APP): The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Wednesday issued a travel advisory urging citizens and tourists to avoid visiting parts of Gilgit-Baltistan due to hazardous weather conditions, ongoing flooding, and increased risks of landslides and road closures.\nThe advisory, released by the National Emergency Operations Centre (NEOC), warned that multiple roads in the northern region have been severely damaged by persistent rainfall and glacial activity. It highlighted Gilgit-Baltistan as particularly vulnerable, advising travelers to exercise extreme caution and avoid unnecessary movement in affected areas.\nAccording to the NDMA, the Shyok River bridge near Saltoro has been blocked by landslides, cutting off access along the route.\nThe Astak Bridge on the Jaglot–Skardu Road has also been partially damaged, restricting traffic to one-way movement.\nSeveral key routes remain inaccessible due to landslides and flash flooding. These include the Diamer–Ghizer Road, Shandur Road, Khalti Road, Dain Road, and Ishkoman Road. In Skardu, roads leading to Kargil, Kharmang, and Shigar via Thangol Nala are completely blocked. The Gilgit–Naltar Road has also been affected, halting traffic entry.\nDespite widespread disruption, restoration efforts have reopened several routes. The Surmo Bridge in Ghanche and Bagicha Road in Skardu are now operational. Traffic has also resumed on the Gulmit–Gojal Road in Hunza, the Jaglot–Gilgit Road via Guro, and Chilam Road in Astore following clearance work.\nThe NDMA continues to monitor the situation and has advised the public to stay updated through official channels before\nundertaking any travel to the region.",
