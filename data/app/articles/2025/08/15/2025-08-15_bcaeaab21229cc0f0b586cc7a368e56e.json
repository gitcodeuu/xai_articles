The festival brought together young writers and established literary figures from across the country in celebration of Pakistan’s Independence Day and Marka-e-Haq. The event was attended by participants from Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Multan, Bahawalpur, Rajanpur, D.G. Khan, Malakand, Chitral, Kashmir, Quetta, Gilgit, Waziristan, and other regions, alongside renowned poets, writers, and international personalities.\nThe festival opened with a flag-hoisting ceremony at PAL’s Chamanistan-e-Adab, attended by noted artist Syed Jamal Shah, Federal Secretary for National Heritage and Culture Division Asad Rehman Gilani, and celebrated literary icons including Zehra Nigah, Sahar Ansari, Kishwar Naheed, Waheed Ahmed, and others.\nThroughout the two days, multiple sessions—including Mitti ka Qarz and Dialogue with Representative Young Creators—explored themes ranging from post-independence opportunities to climate change, cultural traditions, and the responsibilities of young writers. Four parallel training workshops—covering prosody, prose writing, and translation—engaged youth in practical literary exercises.\nA major highlight of the festival was the All Pakistan Mushaira, featuring celebrated poets Anwar Masood, Iftikhar Arif, Sahar Ansari, Anwar Shaoor, among others. Federal Minister for National Heritage and Culture Division Aurangzeb Khan Khichi and Federal Secretary Asad Rehman Gilani were also present.\nThe closing ceremony, presided over by Mahtab Akbar Rashdi with Hafeez Khan as chief guest, praised the youth’s literary contributions.
