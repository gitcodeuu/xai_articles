She clarified that the registration process is fully computerized and free of cost, requiring no forms or payments.\nAdvising beneficiaries to only visit payment centers after receiving an official SMS from 8171, she said this would help prevent overcrowding and inconvenience.\nShe also announced plans to launch a dedicated awareness portal for deserving women.\nThe Chairperson instructed BISP officials to connect successful scholarship recipients from deserving families to the Benazir Hunarmand Program for skill development and economic empowerment.\nShe also directed that BISP beneficiaries be given priority assistance at NADRA offices.\nDuring the session, women highlighted issues such as biometric verification problems during payment collection, and delays in receiving Benazir Taleemi Wazaif and Nashonuma stipends.\nThey also requested the establishment of a dynamic registration center in Nathia Gali to ease travel difficulties.\nSenator Rubina Khalid assured the attendees that their concerns would be addressed on priority and that steps would soon be taken to meet their demands.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
