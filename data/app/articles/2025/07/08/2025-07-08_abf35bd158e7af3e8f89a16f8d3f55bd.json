  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):Director General of Frontier Works Organization (FWO) Major General Abdul Sami Tuesday met with Federal Minister for Railways Muhammad Hanif Abbasi to review progress on the Thar rail connectivity project.\n“Thar’s affordable and indigenous coal will now be transported directly to power plants across the country,” Hanif Abbasi said.\nHe highlighted that the electricity generated using local coal will cost only Rs. 4.7 per unit, compared to Rs. 15 per unit for electricity produced using imported coal — making Thar coal a highly viable alternative for Pakistan’s energy needs.\nThe project is expected to be completed by next year, with FWO assuring timely execution.\nKey project components — including rails, fastenings and thermite welding — are being imported, while sleepers are being manufactured locally. The geotechnical and hydrological surveys have been completed, paving the way for execution of critical implementation stages.\nThe minister said the Thar Rail Project will breathe new life into the national economy and added that the initiative would help save valuable foreign exchange and bring affordable electricity to the masses — “a major good news for the people.”\nThe Ministry of Railways reiterated its full support and commitment to ensuring the swift and successful completion of this national-level strategic initiative.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
