In cases where an individual has already received a Civil Award, only clearly exceptional services rendered thereafter should warrant reconsideration.\nIt was further emphasized that gender balance, provincial representation, and inclusion of minorities and persons with disabilities must be duly reflected in the nomination process, aligning with the principles of equity and national unity.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
