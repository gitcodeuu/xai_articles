  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) of NDMA has issued impact-based weather alerts due to the likelihood of moderate to heavy monsoon rainfall across various regions of Pakistan till July 10, 2025.\nThis weather activity is driven by enhanced moisture inflow from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, coupled with a westerly wave, and is expected to affect the catchment areas of all major rivers, including the Indus, Kabul, Jhelum, and Chenab.\nAs a result of this anticipated weather system, increased river flows are expected, particularly in the Kabul, Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab Rivers. Tarbela, Kalabagh, Chashma, and Taunsa barrages are currently experiencing low flood levels, with further increases in inflows and outflows anticipated in the coming days.\nRiver Chenab at Marala and Khanki, and River Kabul at Nowshera are likely to reach low flood levels. Additionally, River Swat and Panjkora, along with their associated streams and nullahs, may swell due to rainfall in their upper catchments. At present, Tarbela reservoir is at 73% and Mangla at 43% of their respective storage capacities.\nResidents near rivers, nullahs, and flood-prone streams are advised to remain alert for sudden water surges, especially at night or during heavy rain. Vulnerable communities should identify safe evacuation routes and secure valuables, vehicles, and livestock at higher ground.\nEmergency kits, food, water, and essential medicines should be stocked for 3 to 5 days. Local administration, particularly in northeastern and central Punjab, must ensure dewatering equipment is ready to tackle urban flooding. Public is also advised to avoid crossing causeways, low bridges, and flooded roads and stay updated through official TV, radio, mobile alerts, and the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert App.\nSeparately, NEOC has also issued a landslide alert for northern mountainous regions, including Gilgit-Baltistan and AJ&K. Isolated heavy rainfalls are likely in valleys of Gilgit, Skardu, Hunza, Astore, Diamir, Ghanche, and Shigar, while widespread heavy rainfall is expected in Muzaffarabad, Neelum Valley, Rawalakot, Haveli, Bagh, and adjoining areas of AJK.\nAreas such as Kohistan Lower (RD 180), Kolai Palas (RD 200), Nagar (RD 480), Hunza (RD 500), and multiple locations in Rondu Valley identified through JSR mapping, are at risk of landslides, mudslides, and rockfalls.\nAuthorities and residents in high-risk zones are advised to be cautious of slope failures, landslides, and ground subsidence. Travel to vulnerable regions should be avoided unless essential. Relevant Departments are directed to ensure availability of emergency personnel and machinery in the indicated areas and remain on standby for a swift response.\nNDMA continues to coordinate with PDMAs and DDMAs to ensure proactive response measures are in place and to safeguard communities across the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
