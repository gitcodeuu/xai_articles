  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 08 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has announced the establishment of a high-level committee tasked with developing concrete measures to reduce container dwell time at ports by up to 70 percent.\nThe decision was made during a high-level meeting held at the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) headquarters. The session was chaired by the Federal Minister and attended by FBR Chairman Rashid Mahmood Langrial, alongside senior officials and technical representatives from the Ministry of Maritime Affairs, FBR, Customs, and Karachi Port Trust (KPT).\nThe committee will be headed by Additional Secretary of Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Umer Zafar Sheikh, and will include representatives from all key stakeholders—Karachi Port Trust, Pakistan Customs, terminal operators, FBR, and other relevant ministries and departments.\nAddressing the participants, the minister stated that the dwell time of containers at port terminals will be reduced by up to 70%, cutting it down from one week to just two days following the directives of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif.\nThe committee has been tasked with identifying concrete steps to remove procedural hurdles and streamline cargo clearance processes. It will present a comprehensive set of recommendations within ten days.\nThe minister further announced the establishment of a monitoring room at the Ministry of Maritime Affairs to oversee the movement and timing of container handling. A dedicated team will manage the entire monitoring process.\n“Drones and AI technology will also be deployed to monitor vessel docking operations through to the container’s exit from the terminal,” he added.\nMinister Junaid Chaudhry emphasized that reducing dwell time is not merely an administrative change, but a strategic move to enhance port efficiency, lower logistics costs, and strengthen Pakistan’s standing in the regional trade and logistics landscape.\nHe also pointed out that persistent delays in container release have imposed additional costs on importers and exporters, diminishing the competitiveness of Pakistani ports.\nThrough this initiative, the government aims to reduce port congestion, facilitate smoother goods movement, and ensure that the maritime logistics sector plays a strong role in advancing national economic goals, the minister added..\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
