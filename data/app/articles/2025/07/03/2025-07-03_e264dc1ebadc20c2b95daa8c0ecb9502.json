These schools aim to uplift the most marginalized segments of society by providing access to quality education.\nNow, other provinces are also taking steps to replicate this model to support talented students from underprivileged backgrounds. The federal government also plans to establish new Daanish Schools in underserved districts. For this purpose, land has been proposed and detailed visits will be conducted during the feasibility stage.\nThe establishment of these schools represents a major step forward in addressing challenges faced by the education sector, especially in less developed areas.\nBy offering quality education to students from disadvantaged backgrounds, the initiative aims to empower youth, build stronger communities, and help create a more inclusive and equitable society. These schools will move beyond traditional rote learning methods and promote 21st-century education models by integrating technology to improve delivery and track student progress.\nThe core objective of the project is to set up fully functional boarding schools with staff residential facilities, equipped with modern education systems. These institutions will serve both boys and girls from Grade 6 to 12.\nEach school is envisioned as a model institution that combines advanced learning technologies with traditional values, focusing on innovation, entrepreneurship, and digital literacy, all within a safe and inspiring learning environment.\nWhile reviewing the proposals, Federal Minister Ahsan Iqbal stated that more than rs 25 million children in Pakistan are currently out of school, which is a serious national concern.\nHe stressed that raising the literacy rate to 90 percent is essential for the country’s development. He reaffirmed the federal government’s commitment to invest in education and support the provinces in building modern, quality institutions like Daanish Schools under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).\nThe minister appreciated the Government of Balochistan for allocating land for the construction of a Daanish School and for agreeing to bear 50 percent of the project cost, setting a positive example for other provinces.\nHe further said that in line with the Prime Minister’s vision, the initiative aims to expand access to quality education in underdeveloped districts.\nThe Daanish Schools, originally introduced by the Punjab government, are among the largest networks of boarding schools in the country, providing free education to deserving boys and girls from marginalized communities.\nAhsan Iqbal emphasized that the facilities will also be open today to scholars to ensure wider access and promote social equity.\nHe added that by shifting from traditional rote learning methods to modern pedagogical techniques, Pakistan can empower its youth and provide a skilled workforce to drive the national economy forward.\nThe Daanish Schools initiative marks a major step toward building an inclusive and forward-looking education system, especially for children in remote and underserved areas, said Ahsan Iqbal.",
