  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 3 (APP):Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Information for Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Affairs, Ikhtiar Wali Khan criticized the Chief Minister (CM) of KP for mishandling the Swat tragedy, highlighting KP government inefficiency and lack of interest in serving people.\nWhile talking at the press conference on Thursday, he stated that resorting to allegations and propaganda is the hallmark of PTI’s politics, focusing that such tragic incidents could happen all over the world, but the response to those events indicated the performances of the authorities, which the KP government failed to maintain.\nIt is a matter of grave concern that more than one and a half dozen, including women and children, were stuck in river for two hours seeking help. Those could be saved by minor efforts like dropping rope through a drone and other means, Wali Khan said.\nHe added that the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government has focused on only one vision: to release their incarcerated leader without considering legal requirements.\n“This incident has uncovered the KP government priorities, as the victims were 15 yards away from the mainland, seeking help,” he said.\nCM has not officially taken the public into confidence on this incident, as their government was enjoying luxuries, involving corruption, blaming and propaganda against the federal government, dividing people, and others, he focused.\nSeveral examples, followed by other countries during tragic incidents, were quoted by their leader as a precedent, but in the case of the Swat incident, no such practical measures were taken, which clearly indicated an absence of their will for public safety.\nWhile talking about their false claims regarding the non-provision of funds to the provincial, he said, during the current budget, they were expecting 1500-plus billion to be received from the federal government in respect of NPC shares, royalties, and others. While billions of amount were given to the provincial government during 12 years of their ruling.\nWhile talking about the education system in the province under the PTI government, he said the provincial government has announced the construction of schools but has no roadmap for that, while the condition of universities is in a deteriorating state, where most have no vice-chancellor and the remaining ones face financial crises and are on the verge of closing.\nOn the medical situation in the province, he said, during their rule of 12 years, they have not constructed even a single hospital.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
