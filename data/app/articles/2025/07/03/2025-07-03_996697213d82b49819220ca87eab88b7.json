  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 3 (APP):A delegation representing the people of Jammu and Kashmir concluded a series of meetings in Geneva with leading human rights activists and United Nations experts, bringing to light the deteriorating human rights situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and the detrimental impacts of the increasingly militarized Amarnath Yatra pilgrimage.\nThe delegation detailed how the annual Amarnath Yatra, traditionally welcomed by the Kashmiri Muslim community, has been increasingly exploited by the Indian government as a tool to advance a religious agenda, leading to significant socio-economic and environmental consequences for the region, said a press release issued here on Thursday.\n“Kashmiri Muslims have always extended hospitality to Yatris and respected their religious practices,” stated Hurriyat Leader Altaf Hussain Wani. “However, in recent years, the Yatra has been transformed into a vehicle for furthering a Hindutva agenda, resulting in widespread disruption to our daily lives, economic hardship, and severe ecological damage.”\nThe delegation highlighted the heavy militarization surrounding the Yatra, which effectively turns the Kashmir Valley into a security zone, restricting the movement of local residents, disrupting essential services like healthcare and education, and infringing upon fundamental human rights. They presented evidence of increased surveillance, frequent identity checks, and intrusive searches impacting the civilian population.\n“The scale of the security apparatus deployed during the Yatra is disproportionate and creates an atmosphere of fear and intimidation,” the spokesperson added. “Our people are treated as suspects in their own land.”\nFurthermore, the delegation expressed deep concern regarding the environmental impact of the Yatra. They presented reports detailing the significant increase in pollution, deforestation, and glacial melt due to the influx of large numbers of pilgrims and the associated infrastructure development.\nExperts warn that unchecked expansion of the Yatra poses a serious threat to the fragile Himalayan ecosystem.\nThe delegation emphasized that the current approach to the Yatra is not only a violation of human rights but also a deliberate attempt to alter the demographic and cultural identity of IIOJK. They urged the international community to intervene and hold the Indian government accountable for its actions.\nThe delegation comprised Ghulam Muhammad Safi, Syed Faiz Naqashbandi, Sardar Amjad Yousaf, Shamim Shawl, Dr, Saira Shah , Naila Altaf Kayani and Mehru Nisa.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
