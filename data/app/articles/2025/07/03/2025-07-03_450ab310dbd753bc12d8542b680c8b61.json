  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP): Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa has announced a series of wide-ranging development initiatives aimed at transforming Islamabad into one of the world’s most beautiful and citizen-friendly capitals.\nPresiding over a high-level meeting on Thursday, Randhawa laid out plans that include major infrastructure upgrades, new sports and recreational facilities, modern solid waste management, and a strong push for urban beautification.\nAmong the key announcements was the operationalization of a Food Street and Parking Plaza in Blue Area, and the construction of pedestrian-friendly tracks with modern pathways.\nRandhawa directed that the Food Court and pedestrian track be completed on a fast-track basis and that work on the Parking Plaza be expedited for early public access.\nTo encourage healthy lifestyles and youth engagement, CDA has initiated a public auction for five padel courts at different locations across Islamabad.\nThe initiative is expected to generate a record Rs. 76 million in monthly revenue.\nFurthermore, following directions from Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, land has been earmarked for 25 football and 25 cricket grounds, in addition to three futsal fields, one indoor cricket facility, and five cricket academies.\n“These projects reflect our vision of making Islamabad not only more beautiful but also healthier and more active for its citizens,” said Randhawa.\nThe meeting also approved the installation of modern and aesthetic lighting across city parks, with particular focus on F-9 Park and Lake View Park.\nIn a notable development, a dancing fountain will be installed at F-9 Park under a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiative.\nOn the urban infrastructure front, Randhawa emphasized that key highways — including Margalla Road, Club Road, Park Road, Faisal Avenue, and Expressway — are undergoing comprehensive renovation. This includes repairing footpaths, improving green belts, upgrading lane markings, and installing modern lighting.\n“We are paying special attention not just to traffic solutions like new underpasses and expressways but also to the aesthetics and environment of the city,” Randhawa stated. “Projects such as cable cars, electric air-conditioned buses, a theme park, and a Ferris Wheel are also in final stages of planning.”\nThe meeting also reviewed the ongoing model highway beautification project, which includes planting seasonal flowers, installing wooden signage, and using decorative planters. CDA will also replace outdated solid waste machinery with modern equipment to raise cleanliness standards citywide.\nDirectives were issued to upgrade all sector parks with better horticulture, walking tracks, swings, and lighting.\nRandhawa also called for a fully functional sprinkler system to maintain plant health and support greening efforts.\nReaffirming his commitment, Randhawa said, “CDA is using all its resources to enhance residential, transportation, recreational, and environmental standards. The results of these efforts will directly improve the quality of life for residents.”\nThe meeting was attended by senior CDA officials, including Board Members, Chief Officer of MCI, DG Environment, DG Building Control, DG Works, and heads of Enforcement, DMA, and Solid Waste Management.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
