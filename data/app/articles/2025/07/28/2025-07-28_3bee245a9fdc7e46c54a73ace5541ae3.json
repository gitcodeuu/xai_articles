  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):The lower court of Islamabad on Monday suspended the six-month jail sentence of four Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) workers, granting them bail in a case registered under the Peaceful Assembly and Public Order (PAPO) Act.\nJudicial Magistrate Mureed Abbas’s court approved the bail of four PTI workers after suspending their sentences. The workers — Danish, Essa, Ejaz, and Muhammad Essa — had been convicted in a case registered at Tarnol Police Station.\nThe court order came after PTI lawyers Sardar Masroof Khan and Zahid Bashir Dar appeared before the court and filed separate applications requesting suspension of the sentence on behalf of the workers.\nAfter hearing the arguments, the court approved their requests and issued directions for filing an appeal against the sentence within 30 days. Once the bail bonds were submitted, release orders for all four individuals were issued.\nThe four had previously been sentenced to six months’ imprisonment under the PAPO Act in connection with the case lodged at Tarnol police station.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
