The outcomes of our discussions have been formally encapsulated in the Protocol of the session, marking another important step in our shared pursuit of deepening bilateral cooperation.\nThroughout this session, we have reaffirmed the strong convergence of our respective priorities, particularly in promoting trade, investment, and regional connectivity, he added and said that both sides reiterated their commitment to raising bilateral trade to USD 100 million and emphasized the importance of expediting the Transit Trade Agreement. These efforts will be reinforced by the revival of the Joint Business Council, enhanced B2B engagement, and the finalization of MoU on Electronic Data Interchange.\n“I am especially encouraged by the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between the National Investments Agency of the Kyrgyz Republic and Pakistan’s Board of Investment. This strategic partnership lays the foundation for targeted sectoral collaboration and will be further supported by upcoming investment forums on the margins of high-level visits”, he added.\nBeyond trade and investment, the minister said this session has also reflected meaningful progress in several other priority sectors. In agriculture, we look forward to the finalization of the MoU and increased cooperation in phytosanitary control and trade of key food commodities. In the energy and environment domain, both sides agreed to deepen collaboration on electricity transmission and mineral exploration.\nEqually important is our shared focus on regional connectivity. The finalization of the postal cooperation agreement, facilitation of cargo under the 1995 International Motor Transportation Agreement, and prospects for enhanced air connectivity represent promising developments. In the financial sector, agreements on interbank cooperation and training exchanges reaffirm our commitment to building resilient financial linkages.\nWe also welcome the expanding scope of cooperation in healthcare, marked by Kyrgyz pharmacia’s interest in Pakistani pharmaceuticals and ongoing work on the MoU in higher medical education. Furthermore, the proposed Agreement on Art and Culture, along with plans for joint media projects, will further enrich our people-to-people ties.\nBoth sides reiterated their resolve to enhance academic collaboration, particularly in STEAM disciplines, and to build stronger institutional linkages between universities.\nThis 5th session has clearly demonstrated that our partnership is evolving into a comprehensive and forward-looking relationship, driven by shared values, regional vision, and mutual respect. We now have a solid roadmap before us, and the responsibility lies with both sides to maintain the momentum through timely follow-up and result-oriented implementation.\nOn behalf of the Government of Pakistan, minister extend heartfelt appreciation to Kyrgyz delegation, for active engagement and valuable contributions.
