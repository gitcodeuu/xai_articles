  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP):Chairman Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, has reaffirmed his administration’s commitment to removing all illegal encroachments across the city, declaring that no unlawful construction will be tolerated under his watch.\nSpeaking at a high-level meeting at CDA headquarters on Monday, Randhawa said the anti-encroachment campaign — launched under the direction of Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi — is aimed at reclaiming public land, restoring green spaces, and safeguarding Islamabad’s master plan.\n“Islamabad was built under a beautiful and well-planned framework, and we are taking all possible measures to preserve that vision,” Randhawa said. “Dozens of illegal shops, structures, and encroachments have already been removed in recent operations. This action will continue, strictly in accordance with the law.”\nThe chairman emphasized that encroachments not only disrupt the city’s planned layout but also block public pathways, water channels, and green areas meant for community use.\nHe directed all relevant departments to take immediate and indiscriminate action against such violations.\n“To protect the city’s future, we are putting in place a permanent monitoring system to ensure encroachments do not return once removed,” Randhawa added.\nHe also urged the public to cooperate with CDA by reporting any illegal construction, especially on drains and public land. “Citizens are our partners in this mission. We encourage them to notify the Building Control Department and Enforcement Directorate so that legal action can be swiftly taken,” he said.\nThe meeting was attended by CDA officials, senior police officers, and administrative heads who reviewed the progress of the ongoing crackdown. Authorities reiterated their resolve to make Islamabad a safer, cleaner, and more accessible city for all.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
