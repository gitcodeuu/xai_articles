  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP): Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Dr. Musadik Malik has directed an urgent overhaul of Pakistan’s regulatory framework for genetically modified (GMO) soybean meal imports, stressing the need for science-led decisions to strengthen national food security and agricultural sustainability.\nVideo Playerhttps://www.app.com.pk/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/gmo.mp400:0000:0000:00Use Up/Down Arrow keys to increase or decrease volume.\nChairing a high-level committee meeting in Islamabad, Dr. Malik emphasized that all future decisions must be grounded in rigorous scientific analysis.\nHe highlighted Pakistan’s lagging soybean yields compared to other countries and questioned why locally produced soybean seed and meal remain significantly more expensive than imported alternatives.\n“We cannot afford to make uninformed choices. Our agriculture policy must be guided by facts, not assumptions,” Dr. Malik stated, directing relevant departments to conduct a comparative analysis of domestic versus international yield and production costs.\nThe Minister also flagged biosafety concerns, including the risk of gene escape—where genetic traits from GMO crops may unintentionally spread to native or non-GMO varieties.\nHe called for the urgent development of clear safety protocols to safeguard ecosystems and crop integrity.\nTo guide future policy, Dr. Malik appointed Prof. Kosar Abdullah Malik to lead a national conference within ten days, bringing together scientific experts and researchers to advise on seed and biotechnology policies.\nIn a bold policy directive, the Minister ordered the finalization and implementation of a comprehensive biosafety and biotechnology regulatory framework within 90 days. “This is critical to ensure sustainable agricultural development, protect biodiversity, and secure our food systems,” he said.\nPakistan has increasingly relied on imported soybean meal—mainly for poultry and livestock feed—due to underdeveloped domestic production.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
