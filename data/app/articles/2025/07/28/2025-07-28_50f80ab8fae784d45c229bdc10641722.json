By issuing millions of domiciles and settling non-state people, the demographic structure of the state is being changed so that the Muslim majority character of the state can be changed into a minority.\nHe made it clear that despite all these atrocities, intimidation, and political revenge, the Kashmiri people will not back down even an inch from their demand for their right to self-determination. The Hurriyat leadership and the Kashmiri nation are determined to achieve their fundamental right in accordance with the UN resolutions.\nMushtaq Ahmed Butt strongly appealed to the UN, the European Union, the OIC, and international human rights organizations to, take immediate notice of these cruel measures by India, fulfill their legal, moral, and humanitarian duty to stop the ongoing human rights violations in Kashmir and apply global pressure and take practical steps to give the Kashmiris their right to self-determination.\nAugust 5 is not just a date, but a symbol of tyranny against which the Kashmiri people have raised the flag of resistance. No matter how severe the oppression, the light of truth defeats it.\nThe Hurriyat leadership is with the Kashmiri people, and this struggle will continue until the goal is achieved, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
