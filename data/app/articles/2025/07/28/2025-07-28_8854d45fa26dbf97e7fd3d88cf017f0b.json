  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP): Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited the residence of Major Ziaad Saleem in Rawalpindi, who was recently martyred during a security operation in Balochistan.\nMajor Ziaad, a brave officer of the Pakistan Army, laid down his life for the nation, twenty years after his father, Brigadier Saleem, embraced martyrdom in service of the country in 2005.\nDuring his visit, Minister Mohsin Naqvi met with the martyr’s grieving family, including his mother, brothers, and sister. Expressing heartfelt condolences, he offered Fatiha and prayed for the elevation of the martyr’s rank in the hereafter and for strength and patience for the bereaved family.\nThe Minister praised the exceptional courage and fortitude displayed by the family, particularly Major Ziaad’s mother, saying, “Brave and resilient mothers like you are the pride of our nation. Your strength is unmatched, and your son’s sacrifice will never be forgotten.” He also lauded the bravery of Major Ziaad’s siblings, appreciating the family’s steadfast commitment to Pakistan.\nMohsin Naqvi assured the family that the state would stand by them in every possible way. “We will take care of your family in every respect. The sacrifices made by our martyrs and their families are a debt the nation can never fully repay,” he said.\nThe visit turned even more poignant when the martyr’s brother played Major Ziaad Saleem’s final audio message, recorded shortly before his martyrdom. The emotional moment deeply moved everyone present.\nSpeaking with grace and strength, Major Ziaad’s mother shared that her son had recently married but remained unwavering in his devotion to the country. “His love for the homeland bordered on obsession. Even when injured, he continued to protect his comrades without any concern for his own life,” she recalled.\nShe further stated, “After my husband’s martyrdom in 2005, I now give my son to the soil of Pakistan. I have always stood with the country and the Pakistan Armed Forces and I always will.”\nMajor Ziaad’s sacrifice has drawn comparisons to his father’s, Brigadier Saleem, who also laid down his life in the line of duty, making the family a shining example of patriotism and service.\nIslamabad Inspector General of Police Ali Nasir Rizvi and Chief Commissioner Islamabad Muhammad Ali Randhawa also accompanied the Interior Minister and paid their respects to the martyr’s family.\nMajor Ziaad Saleem’s sacrifice, along with the legacy of his martyred father, stands as a beacon of courage and unwavering loyalty to the nation. Their story will be remembered as a proud chapter in Pakistan’s history of heroism and resilience.",
