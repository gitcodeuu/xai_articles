The second session involves calligraphy training based on Islamic and Turkish cultural themes, aimed at developing the children’s aesthetic and artistic abilities. The third session introduces traditional Turkish games such as archery and Mangala, encouraging physical activity and offering children a deeper, hands-on appreciation of Turkish traditions.\nAddressing the opening ceremony, Dr. Zahid Majeed stated that this is the University’s third Turkish Summer Camp, and it continues to serve as an effective platform to nurture children’s hidden talents, broaden their exposure to global cultures, and shape their personalities with confidence and awareness. He further announced that the camp’s closing ceremony will feature AIOU Vice Chancellor, Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood, and the Ambassador of Türkiye to Pakistan as chief guests.\nProf. Dr. Khalil Tokar, in his remarks, expressed hope that the summer camp would further strengthen the cultural and emotional bonds between the people of Pakistan and Türkiye. Education Attaché Mehmet Tugrul Türker added that the camp provides children with more than just language skills—it also offers a comprehensive understanding of Türkiye’s rich history, cultural values, and modern advancements.\nThe event reflects AIOU’s commitment to fostering international collaboration and cultural exchange, especially among younger generations.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
