The ISSI delegation was led by Ambassador Sohail Mahmood, Director General of ISSI, accompanied by Mr. Jetha Nand, Second Secretary at the Embassy of Pakistan in Moscow.\nThe dialogue focused on current regional and global developments, including the shifting geopolitical landscape, evolving security trends, and opportunities for enhanced bilateral cooperation in the political, economic, humanitarian, and strategic domains. Both sides also explored avenues for multilateral engagement and sustainable development within the broader Eurasian context.\nThis round of engagement builds on the institutional partnership formalized earlier this year when ISSI and ICCA RAS signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in April 2025 in Islamabad. The MoU aims to promote joint research, scholarly exchanges, and dialogue on critical regional and global issues.\nThe meeting reaffirmed the shared commitment of both institutions to fostering long-term academic and research collaboration and contributing to the rapidly evolving multi-faceted Pakistan–Russia partnership.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
