Unfortunately, our train has fallen behind, and it is now our responsibility to set it back on the right track”.\nHe stressed the need for building an inclusive society, stating, “Pakistan needs people who could spread love, not command from above. We are all Pakistanis, whether part of a majority or a minority, and that singular identity must prevail.”\nHe said: “On the instructions of the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, I’m here to reaffirm that the dream envisioned by Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and embedded in our Constitution is not just an aspiration, it is a living reality. Every citizen, regardless of religion, deserves equal rights and recognition under the law”, he added.\nHighlighting social responsibility, he said: “We must also turn our attention to the underprivileged, the children playing in the dirt and the brick kiln laborers. These are the segments of Pakistan that need our compassion and focus.” He also spoke about the Civil Services Academy, calling it a vital institution for nurturing future nation-builders. “This is no longer the era of colonial command-and-control. What we need now is love, empathy, and dialogue, not hatred,” he emphasized.\nReferring to the white in Pakistan’s flag, he said it symbolizes minorities and that the spirit must be reflected in our behavior, not just our symbols.\nThe senator also highlighted the formation of the National Commission for Minority Rights, established under Articles 20, 26, 27, and 36 of the Constitution, to ensure equal opportunities and protection for non-Muslim citizens. “These provisions are not dormant clauses, they are living elements of our constitutional fabric. With sincere efforts, a time will come when special quotas for minorities will no longer be necessary, as inclusivity becomes the norm,” he said. He expressed gratitude to the organizers, artists, and attendees and prayed for Pakistan’s progress and interfaith harmony.\nLater, talking to the media, Azam Nazeer Tarar said that the suspension of 26 members of the Punjab Assembly falls within the Speaker’s jurisdiction. He added that the speaker had the authority to refer a reference to the Chief Election Commissioner to de-seating the assembly members as he was the head of the House. He noted that all assembly members had taken an oath under the Constitution to perform their duties with honesty and integrity. “If any member violates this oath, the speaker has the authority to take action against them,” Tarar said.\nSenator Tarar acknowledged the opposition’s right to protest but condemned acts of violence and vandalism. “Throwing chairs, breaking microphones, and damaging assembly property is not protest, it is a violation of the law,” he remarked. He expressed hope that the speaker of the Punjab Assembly would resolve the issue in a way that upholds the dignity of the House and democratic traditions.\nOn the occasion, Patron-in-chief Pakistan Hindu Council Ramesh Kumar Vankwani Dr Ramesh Kumar said that the term “non-Muslim” should be preferred over “minority”, as the latter reflects a narrower, exclusionary mindset. He urged that this terminology be adopted across all government institutions, including the academy.\nDr. Ramesh Kumar also advocated for increasing the age limit for civil service exams to 35 years to give more opportunities to young aspirants, particularly from marginalized backgrounds.\nState Minister for Political Affairs Talha Burki, Punjab Human Rights Secretary Farid Ahmad Tarar, Member National Commission for Human Rights Punjab Nadeem Ashraf CSA Director General Farhan Aziz Khawaja, Director Capacity Building Dr Shabeer Akbar and others were present.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
