  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 07 (APP):The traditional 11th Muharram procession in the federal capital was taken out from the historic Bari Imam Imambargah on Monday under stringent security arrangements to commemorate the sacrifices of Imam Hussain (RA) and his loyal companions in Karbala.\nThe procession, comprising mourners from across various sects, followed its traditional route through Bari Imam and concluded peacefully at the Peer House in the same locality. A large number of faithful participated in the procession, paying rich tribute to the martyrs of Karbala through Noha Khwani, Matam, and Zikr-e-Shuhada.\nProminent religious and spiritual leader Pir Syed Haider Gilani, while addressing the mourners and media, emphasized that the message of Karbala is one of truth, justice, and unwavering moral values.\n“We are the inheritors of a sacred legacy,” he said. “Our mission is to uphold the flag of truth and righteousness. We urge all Muslims to draw lessons from Karbala and stand with justice, regardless of the circumstances.”\nHe further underscored the importance of embodying the values of Imam Hussain (RA) not only in belief but also in character and conduct to establish a just and equitable society.\nThe Islamabad Police, in collaboration with other law enforcement agencies, ensured foolproof security during the procession. Containers and barbed wire were placed along key routes leading to the Bari Imam shrine and Imambargah, while strict checking protocols were enforced at all entry and exit points.\nMultiple Sabeels (free water stations) and Langar (free food stalls) were set up along the route, reflecting the spirit of service and devotion that defines Muharram.\nAt the conclusion of the peaceful procession, organizers and community leaders praised the efforts of the security forces and expressed hope that the same atmosphere of unity, discipline, and interfaith harmony would continue throughout the month of Muharram.\nThe event stood as a powerful reminder of the enduring relevance of Karbala’s message and the strength of religious tolerance in Pakistan’s diverse society.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
