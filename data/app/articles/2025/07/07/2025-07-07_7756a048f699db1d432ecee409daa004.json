The committee, he said, would engage all stakeholders, including elected representatives, and would work through broad consultations to address tribal concerns and enhance governance in the region.\nSecretary of the Ministry of Kashmir Affairs and Gilgit-Baltistan, Zafar Hasan was also present during the press conference.",
