The proposed changes include ensuring 33% women representation in the Senate of PIFD, in line with the Prime Minister’s Office directive for all federal bodies.\nFurthermore, the new clause proposes that the Vice Chancellor’s appointment be restricted to a four-year term, with no extensions, but open to competitive re-selection. “This will lead to transparency and credibility — we don’t want heads to be bigger than the institutions themselves. Legislation should solve problems, not create them,” the Chairman remarked.\nShe also stressed that a mandatory quarterly Senate meeting must be held to maintain checks and balances and sought a complete list of federal institutions where vice chancellors have served beyond one or two terms.\nThe Committee next deliberated the Federal Supervision of Curricula, Textbooks and Maintenance of Standards of Education (Amendments) Bill 2024, moved by Senator Qurat-Ul-Ain Marri. After extensive debate on sensitive aspects — particularly age limits for reproductive health education — the Bill was deferred for further input.\nWhile Senators Kamran Murtaza and Gurdeep Singh rejected the Bill outright, other members suggested amendments, including setting the age for reproductive health education at 13 or 16 years, respecting cultural sentiments and local context. “The intention is clear: to curb child abuse, misinformation on the internet, and ensure that ‘reproductive health education’ equips children with accurate knowledge about their physical, mental, and social well-being,” the Chairman emphasized.\nOn the agenda item moved by Senator Sarmad Ali regarding “provision of free milk in ICT educational institutions”, Ministry officials acknowledged the noble intent but highlighted cost implications — estimating a requirement of “Rs. 900 million” — and potential food safety risks due to milk’s perishable nature.\nThe Committee decided to review the “Punjab Government’s provision of free milk model” and invited stakeholders, including representatives from “Nestlé” and “Olpers”, to deliberate on sustainable frameworks.\nIn a detailed briefing, the “Directorate General of Special Education (DGSE)” presented its current roles, functions, and ongoing projects. The Chairman reiterated the urgent need to table a “comprehensive policy draft” for Special Education, lamenting that the sector still operates under outdated legislation predating the 18th Amendment.\nDuring the meeting key financial figures were also discussed:\n“FY 2023–24”:Grant Rs. 950.364 million, Expenditure Rs. 886.614 million, Deficit Rs. 63.75 million “FY 2024–25: Grant Rs. 726.008 million, Expenditure Rs. 840.753 million, Deficit Rs. 114.745 million “FY 2025–26:”Requirement Rs. 1,436 million, Allocation Rs. 788.188 million\nInstitutions under DGSE include the National Special Education Centres for “Visually Handicapped, Physically Handicapped, Hearing Impaired Children”, and the “Rehabilitation Centre for Children with Developmental Disorders”.\nThe Committee directed that the “Secretary of the Health Ministry” be called in to discuss the inclusion of test through which children with hearing issues be detected and also be included in Children health Card”, ensuring tests are done within six months of birth. It also called for a comprehensive review of the “PSDP budget allocations” for special education.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
