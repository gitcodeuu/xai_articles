  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 7 (APP):National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) of National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) on Monday issued a two-day alert as strong monsoon currents from the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, coupled with a westerly wave, may cause heavy rainfall and potential riverine and flash flooding across major river catchments till July 10.\nAccording to NEOC, these weather conditions are expected to bring moderate to heavy rainfall, particularly over major river catchments, with a high likelihood of both riverine and flash flooding in vulnerable areas.\nAuthorities urge residents in at-risk regions to stay informed and take necessary precautions.\nAccording to NEOC’s forecast, increased water flows are expected in all major rivers including Kabul, Indus, Jhelum and Chenab.\nCurrently, low flood levels are being observed at Tarbela, Kalabagh and Chashma on the Indus River, while Taunsa is also expected to reach the low flood mark.\nRiver Chenab is likely to experience low flood levels at Marala and Khanki stations. River Kabul at Nowshera is expected to rise to low flood levels, while Swat and Panjkora Rivers, along with their associated streams and nullahs, may swell due to rainfall in their catchment areas.\nRiver Jhelum, along with its tributaries, is expected to experience elevated inflows, resulting in localized flash floods. Inflows at Mangla Dam on River Jhelum are projected to reach the low flood limit.\nIn northeastern Punjab, nullahs originating from the Pir Panjal range may experience significant increases in water levels, possibly reaching medium flood intensity. Hill torrents in Dera Ghazi Khan and Rajanpur districts may once again become active, generating medium to high flows. In Balochistan, nullahs and seasonal streams in the northeastern districts including Jhal Magsi, Kachi, Sibi, Qila Saifullah, Zhob, and Musakhel are also likely to experience high flows. In Gilgit-Baltistan, the Hunza and Shigar rivers may see increased water discharge, with flash flooding possible in their tributaries, including Hispar, Khunjerab, Shimshal, Braldu, Hushe and Saltoro Rivers.\nResidents living near rivers, streams and nullahs are advised to stay vigilant for sudden increases in water levels, particularly at night or during periods of intense rainfall. Communities are urged to stay informed through official flood alerts and weather warnings.\nPeople living in vulnerable areas should identify safe evacuation routes and relocate essential items, vehicles, and livestock to higher and safer locations. Emergency kits, including food, drinking water, and medical supplies, should be prepared for at least three to five days. District Administration, particularly in northeastern and central Punjab, should ensure the availability and functionality of dewatering pumps to cope with potential urban flooding.\nNDMA is closely monitoring the evolving flood situation and remains in constant coordination with PDMAs and DDMAs to ensure timely preparedness and response measures. NDMA reiterates its commitment to safeguarding vulnerable communities and urges the public to remain vigilant, follow official advisories, download and use Pakistan NDMA Disaster Alert App for timely updates and safety guidance.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
