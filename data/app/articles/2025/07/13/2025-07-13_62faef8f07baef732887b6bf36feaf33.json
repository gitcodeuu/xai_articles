As the corridor enters its next phase, it is the significant number of women, trained across the country under CPEC-linked initiatives, who are poised to take the lead, reshaping industries, uplifting communities, and ensuring that the promise of progress is shared more equally than ever before.\nIn Tharparkar, Sindh, women are breaking barriers under the flagship of CPEC. Through the Thar Block II Project of Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), up to 70 women have been trained as heavy dump truck drivers, a first for this traditionally conservative and underprivileged region.\nSimilar stories are emerging from Balochistan’s coastal city of Gwadar, where over 20 women have been trained in garment production at a tailoring center inside the Gwadar Port Free Zone. Supported by China Overseas Ports Holding Company (COPHC) and the Chinese Consulate, the initiative provides women with stipends as they produce uniforms for port workers.\nSpeaking exclusively to APP, Umair Pervez Khan, Secretary of the Consortium of Asia Pacific Studies (CAPS), noted that CPEC is evolving from an infrastructure-focused vision to a human-centered model of inclusive and sustainable development.\n“CPEC is not just about roads and trade,” he said. “It is a platform of opportunity, and women are at the heart of this transformation.”\nAccording to Pervez Khan, the second phase of CPEC focuses on sustainable development, special economic zones (SEZs), vocational training, and community empowerment.\n“We are witnessing the start of a social shift. Women who once had no access to education or income opportunities are now contributing to their local economies with skill and dedication,” he noted clearly impressed.\nAs SEZs become operational in various provinces, policymakers and development partners are working to integrate women’s roles into industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and operations—sectors traditionally dominated by men.\nPervez Khan emphasized that CPEC’s long-term success depends on the inclusion of women at all levels of economic activity, particularly within SEZs like Rashakai and Dhabeji.\n“The only way forward is to build inclusion into the foundation of our economic zones—so women are part of the system from the start,” he said.\nHe also stressed the need for vocational centers, daycare facilities, and women-friendly work environments to become standard features in all SEZs, to support women’s participation and retention in the workforce.\nBeyond income generation, CPEC is also reshaping social attitudes. In regions where women’s mobility and public presence were once highly restricted, local success stories are inspiring communities and creating new pathways for young women to find employment.\n“These early achievements need support through awareness campaigns and local partnerships,”  Umair  Khan said.\n“When one woman steps forward, it encourages others. That ripple effect can only last with continued community engagement and recognition.”\nKhan believes Pakistan can set a regional example through CPEC by promoting gender-inclusive development.\n“With inclusive policies, Pakistan can use infrastructure and trade to uplift not just GDP, but human lives,” he remarked.\nAcross the country, progress is already visible. In Sindh, 70 women are trained as dump truck drivers in Tharparkar, while 21 others work in solar maintenance. In Balochistan, over 20 women are employed and trained at the Gwadar Women Garment Factory. In Punjab, improved energy access in SEZs has boosted female employment in the textile sector. In Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, better transport links have opened urban jobs and training opportunities for women. Additionally, 191 female police officers have joined Sindh’s CPEC security force.\nAs the Pak-China partnership advances under the Belt and Road Initiative, this multi-billion dollar corridor is connecting Pakistan to global markets while driving regional growth. Now focused on sustainability and inclusion, it is empowering women in remote areas with skills and opportunities, enabling them to contribute meaningfully to both the national and global economy. Their role is no longer secondary, it is central to lasting progress.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
