  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 13 (APP):Pakistan’s non-formal education sector has recorded significant strides in access and inclusion, with a 20% increase in enrollments and promising gender indicators, according to the 2023–24 National Non-Formal Education (NFE) Statistical Report released by the Pakistan Institute of Education (PIE).\nThe annual report, unveiled here the other day, presented a detailed snapshot of the country’s non-formal learning landscape, spotlighting both achievements and persistent gaps. The number of non-formal education centers across the country has reached 35,427, serving over 1.29 million learners, reflecting a 20% increase in enrollment compared to the previous year.\nThe report notes that in 2023–24, enrollments in non-formal education centers grew by 20%, with 57% of learners being girls, marking a promising step toward gender parity. Female teachers make up 82% of the workforce, demonstrating strong female participation in the non-formal education system.\nA total of 3,382 adult literacy centers are currently operational, serving 80,093 learners, indicating an increasing focus on youth and adult literacy. Additionally, 10,181 refugee children, mostly from Afghanistan, are enrolled in NFE programs. Innovative models like ALP (Middle-Tech) have been introduced, integrating both academic and vocational skills to improve retention and outcomes.\nDespite the progress, the report highlights substantial regional disparities, particularly in enrollment rates across remote and underserved areas. According to the Pakistan Economic Survey, female literacy remains significantly lower than male literacy, especially in rural Balochistan, where only 31% of women are literate. The latest UN report ranks Pakistan 164th out of 193 countries on the Human Development Index (HDI), and 144th out of 173 on the Human Capital Index (HCI), with education being a key contributing factor.\nAmong the report’s key recommendations is the expansion of ALP programs, particularly the Middle-Tech model, which boasts a 70% completion rate. The report also calls for greater investment in adult literacy programs, the adoption of modern tools like Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL), and targeted measures to reduce gender and regional disparities. Furthermore, it stresses the need for enhanced data collection and analysis to support evidence-based policymaking.\nThe report underscores the use of NF-EMIS, a web-based data management system that collects and integrates real-time data from all provinces to strengthen decision-making.\nNon-formal education has been described as a “second-chance model” that is cost-effective, flexible, and community-based. The monthly cost per child ranges between PKR 1,000 to 1,500, considerably lower than the expenses of formal education systems.\nPIE’s annual report affirms that non-formal education is emerging as an effective, low-cost alternative that is bringing millions of children, youth, and adults into the learning stream. However, the continued challenges of low female literacy, regional inequality, and the large out-of-school population demand urgent and sustainable action. The report offers a comprehensive roadmap for strengthening educational foundations to drive national development.\nThis national effort has been made possible through the active involvement of both public and private sector partners. At the federal level, institutions such as the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE), National Education Foundation (NEF), Basic Education Community Schools (BECS), and Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU) have played key roles.\nIn Punjab, the Punjab Education Foundation (PEF), PEIMA, and the School Education Department (South Punjab) are contributing. In Sindh, the Sindh Education Foundation (SEF); in Balochistan, the Social Welfare Department; and in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the Elementary and Secondary Education Foundation (ESEF) are leading efforts.\nNational and international NGOs (NGOs/INGOs) are also crucial stakeholders in expanding educational access across the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
