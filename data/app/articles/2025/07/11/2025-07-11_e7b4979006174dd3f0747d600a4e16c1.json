With a focus on structural reforms and service efficiency, the Board endorsed several landmark decisions aimed at reshaping the authority’s internal and external functioning.\nThe key outcomes included the regularization of employees, release of pending salaries, and immediate disbursement of wages to staff in BS-01 to BS-04—steps that signal a renewed commitment to the well-being of the PSQCA workforce.\nThe Board also approved the deployment of solar energy systems across PSQCA offices nationwide, aligning the institution with national goals of sustainability and cost-effective energy use.\nFurthering Pakistan’s global trade objectives, the Board gave the green light to an MoU with the UK’s Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA), expected to facilitate smoother export processes for Pakistani food products.\nIn another major move, the Board sanctioned the implementation of SAP software in finance and HR systems to digitalize and streamline operations.\nThe other important decisions included approval for new vehicles to support fieldwork (pending clearance from the Finance Division’s Austerity Committee), continuation of medical services under existing rules, and endorsement of a Mutual Recognition Agreement with an international automobile testing lab to strengthen standards in the auto sector.\nKhalid Hussain Magsi lauded the Board’s proactive approach and directed all departments to ensure immediate execution of approved reforms.\nHe emphasized the need for transparency, accountability, and results-driven governance to restore public confidence and institutional credibility.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
