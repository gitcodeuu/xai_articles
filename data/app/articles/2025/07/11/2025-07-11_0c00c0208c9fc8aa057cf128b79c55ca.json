He added that, fortunately, their partner organizations are committed to achieving this goal. He explained that the university, in collaboration with the Ministry of Education, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA), and the Pakistan Institute of Education, is providing education up to the matriculation level to children from underprivileged areas, especially girls.\nDr. Nasir Mahmood further stated that over 1.3 million children are currently receiving education under the ALP project. The university aims to include all out-of-school children in the education system and achieve 100% literacy in the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
