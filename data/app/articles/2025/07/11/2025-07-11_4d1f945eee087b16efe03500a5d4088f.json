He requested the court to dismiss the charges against his client on similar grounds as those previously acquitted.\nFollowing the arguments, the court reserved its decision on Qureshi’s acquittal plea. The case was initially registered at Tarnol Police Station.\nMeanwhile, the hearing of another case related to the Haqeeqi Azadi March, involving the PTI founder and party workers, could not proceed due to the unavailability of PTI founder.\nThe court marked the attendance of the other accused and adjourned the proceedings without further developments.\nAdvocate Sardar Muhammad Masroof Khan appeared on behalf of PTI workers during the hearing.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
