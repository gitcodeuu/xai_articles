Despite having paid the full cost of the plot and 50% of the development charges, her repeated visits to the Bahria Town management yielded no results.\nFollowing a thorough review of the case, FOSPAH found that Bahria Town failed to provide any notice or opportunity of hearing before cancelling the plot;  a fundamental violation of the complainant’s rights.\nIn her final order, the Federal Ombudsperson ruled that: “The failure to pay a relatively minor amount in additional charges does not give the management the right to cancel the entire allotment without due process. Citizens must be given notice and an opportunity to be heard before any such punitive action.”\nUnder the directions of Ms. Fauzia Viqar, Bahria Town has now allotted Ms. Romana a new plot of equivalent value in a developed sector and issued her an official allotment letter.\nThis case highlights FOSPAH’s important role in the enforcement of women’s right to property under the Enforcement of Women’s Property Rights Act, 2020.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
