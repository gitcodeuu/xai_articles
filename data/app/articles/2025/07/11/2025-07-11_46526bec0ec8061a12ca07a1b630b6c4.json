  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP):The National Assembly Standing Committee on Railways, chaired by MNA Rai Hassan Nawaz Khan, has constituted a sub-committee to probe the audio leak involving the Divisional Superintendent of Pakistan Railways Karachi and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Pakistan Railways.\nThe committee met late Friday night at Parliament House in Islamabad for its 11th session.\nThe sub-committee, to be convened by MNA Shafqat Abbas, will also include MNAs Ibrar Ahmad, Sadiq Ali Memon, and Syed Waseem Hussain. It is tasked with examining inquiry reports and presenting its findings within 30 days.\nDuring the session, a report presented by the Commissioner of Dera Ghazi Khan regarding the land at Mouza Sonaki in Muzaffargarh was rejected by the committee.\nTo resolve the long-standing dispute over ownership, the committee summoned the Senior Member of Punjab’s Board of Revenue and the Commissioner of Dera Ghazi Khan for the next meeting.\nRailways Minister briefed the committee on recent improvements in passenger amenities. “Water filter plants and coolers have been installed at major stations, and we plan to expand these facilities,” the minister said.\nHe also assured that the quality of food and cleanliness at stations is being monitored regularly, with janitorial services outsourced to waste management firms.\nMembers raised concerns over the winding-up of state-owned enterprises such as the Railway Construction Company (RAILCOP), Pakistan Railway Advisory and Consultancy Services (PRACS), and Pakistan Railway Freight and Transportation Company (PRFTC).\nThe minister explained that the closure was part of the government’s right-sizing policy. “These services are now being handled directly by Pakistan Railways,” he added.\nThe committee recommended reassigning experienced employees from the dissolved companies to relevant departments.\nThe committee was informed that Pakistan Railways’ petition regarding the Shalimar Hospital land dispute in Lahore was refused by the Attorney General’s office.\nThe committee urged the ministry to reapproach the office to escalate the matter to the Supreme Court.\nThe committee also took stock of the Royal Palm Golf and Country Club leasing process, which is being supervised by the Supreme Court.\nA pre-bid meeting held in April saw participation from 16 firms, with bid openings scheduled for July 22.\nPakistan Railways currently provides only 5–8% of national freight services.\nThe CEO acknowledged the gap and said that outsourcing to international firms is underway to expand capacity.\nThe minister added that interest from multinationals would help boost the service soon.\nOn the long-awaited ML-1 railway track upgradation project, the committee was informed that the Punjab Chief Minister had shown willingness to finance Rs. 350 billion for the dualization of railway tracks in the province.\nThe committee expressed concern over 47 railway officers who are living abroad while drawing full salaries and benefits.\nThe minister assured that these cases are under review, and a detailed report will be presented in the next meeting.\nAdditionally, the committee directed the ministry to repair the Red Bridge over the Kabul River in Nowshera, particularly the pedestrian walkway.\nThe meeting was attended by several MNAs, including Ramesh Lal and Waseem Qadir (via Zoom), as well as senior officials from the Ministry of Railways and Pakistan Railway.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
