  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 04 (APP): Federal Minister for National Food Security and Research, Rana Tanveer Hussain on Friday praised the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s longstanding humanitarian support to Pakistan, calling it a reflection of “deep-rooted, historic, and unbreakable bonds” between the two brotherly nations.\nAddressing a ceremony organized by the Saudi Embassy to mark the launch of the third phase of the Food Security Support Project, the minister thanked Saudi leadership for providing 30,000 food baskets to underprivileged communities across Pakistan. The initiative is being executed through the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief).\n“This noble gesture is more than an act of charity – it is a reaffirmation of our spiritual, cultural, and strategic brotherhood. Saudi Arabia has always stood by Pakistan – in times of disaster, economic challenges, and beyond,” Rana Tanveer said.\nHe recalled the Kingdom’s swift and generous responses during key crises in Pakistan’s history, including the earthquakes of 2005 and 2013, and floods in 2010, 2014, and 2022. “Whether it’s food, medicine, shelter, or cash assistance, Saudi Arabia has always led from the front,” he remarked.\nRana Tanveer highlighted Saudi Arabia’s contributions to Pakistan’s food security and agricultural development, citing over $220 million in aid provided in 2023 alone for food stability programs. He also praised the Saudi Fund for Development’s (SFD) role in strengthening agricultural infrastructure and enhancing storage and irrigation capacity across the country.\nHe further noted that the Kingdom’s support extends beyond emergency aid. “From financing hospitals and schools to vocational centers and health camps, Saudi Arabia’s development assistance is transforming lives in Pakistan,” he said.\nRecognizing the spirit of people-to-people generosity, the minister recalled contributions from Saudi leaders and citizens including a $200 million donation by the late King Abdullah for the 2010 flood victims, and continued aid under King Salman bin Abdulaziz.\n“This friendship is mutual,” he asserted, noting the Pakistan Army’s consistent military cooperation with the Kingdom, including participation in regional security initiatives such as the Islamic Military Counter-Terrorism Coalition. He also acknowledged the role of over 2.5 million Pakistani workers contributing to Saudi Arabia’s growth and sending vital remittances back home.\nCalling the distribution of food baskets a “symbol of unity of the Ummah,” the minister said the Pakistan-Saudi relationship remains a beacon of Islamic solidarity in a fractured global landscape. “On behalf of the Government of Pakistan, I extend our heartfelt gratitude to the leadership and people of Saudi Arabia. May our friendship continue to grow, and may Allah guide us toward a future of shared prosperity,” he concluded.",
