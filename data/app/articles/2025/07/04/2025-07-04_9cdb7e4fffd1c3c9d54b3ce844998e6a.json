Our approach will remain anchored in the principles of the UN Charter, multilateralism, and international law.”The Spokesperson announced that Pakistan will convene two high-level signature events including an open debate on “Promoting International Peace and Security through Multilateralism and the Peaceful Settlement of Disputes” on July 22, and a briefing on “UN Cooperation with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)” on July 24.Additionally, Pakistan will preside over the quarterly open debate on the Question of Palestine on July 23, all chaired by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, he added.“These meetings reflect Pakistan’s intent to serve as a bridge between the Council and the broader UN membership,” the Spokesperson added.Ambassador Shafqat also announced that Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif is currently in Khankendi, Azerbaijan, leading Pakistan’s delegation to the 17th Summit of the Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO).“The Prime Minister will articulate Pakistan’s vision for regional connectivity, trade, climate resilience, and sustainable development, in line with the ECO Vision 2025,” said the Spokesperson, adding that the Prime Minister is also expected to hold bilateral meetings with fellow ECO leaders.Touching on recent bilateral diplomacy, the Spokesperson confirmed that Foreign Minister Senator Ishaq Dar had a telephonic exchange with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, in which they discussed regional developments and the upcoming ASEAN Regional Forum scheduled for July 10–11 in Kuala Lumpur.He announced that Ambassador Kamran Akhtar, Pakistan’s Permanent Representative to the UN in Vienna, has been elected President of the 53rd Session of the Industrial Development Board (UNIDO).He said, “This is the first time Pakistan has held this prestigious position, a recognition of our constructive global engagement and commitment to sustainable industrial development.”The Spokesperson also welcomed a Supplemental Award issued on June 27 by the Court of Arbitration in the Kishenganga and Ratle hydroelectric dispute between Pakistan and India.“The Court reaffirmed its competence to continue proceedings despite India’s unilateral attempt to hold the Indus Waters Treaty in abeyance. This Award vindicates Pakistan’s legal and moral stance,” he stated. “We call upon India to resume normal functioning under the Treaty and fully honor its international obligations.”Ambassador Shafqat briefed the media on the Fifth Round of Pakistan-China Consultations on Multilateral Issues, held on June 26 in Beijing. “Led by Special Secretary Ambassador Nabeel Munir, Pakistan and China reaffirmed convergence on a wide range of UN-related issues and agreed to further strengthen coordination on global peace and security,” he noted.Providing an update on consular matters, the Spokesperson confirmed that Pakistan and India exchanged lists of prisoners on July 1, 2025, as mandated by the 2008 Agreement on Consular Access.He said, “Pakistan shared a list of 246 Indian or believed-to-be-Indian prisoners, while India provided a list of 463 Pakistani or believed-to-be-Pakistani prisoners.”He reiterated Pakistan’s call for the immediate release of prisoners who have completed their sentences, particularly those with confirmed nationality, and urged India to grant special consular access to all those still awaiting verification, including mentally and physically challenged detainees. “Humanitarian issues remain a priority in Pakistan’s foreign policy,” Ambassador Shafqat emphasized.The Spokesperson expressed serious concern over the deteriorating health of senior Kashmiri leader Shabbir Ahmed Shah, incarcerated in India’s Tihar Jail for over eight years.“Mr. Shah has now been diagnosed with prostate cancer. His condition requires urgent medical attention, which cannot be administered in prison,” Ambassador Shafqat said. “We strongly urge Indian authorities to release Mr. Shah on humanitarian grounds.”“Pakistan continues to pursue a principled and balanced foreign policy—guided by diplomacy, cooperation, and respect for international law,” concluded the Spokesperson.Responding to media queries, the Foreign Office Spokesperson reiterated Pakistan’s position on several bilateral and international matters during its weekly media briefing.He said Pakistan rejected India’s denial of the supplemental award by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA), terming New Delhi’s position “illegal” and lacking legitimacy under international law.The spokesperson emphasized that the Indus Water Treaty remains operative and the award reaffirms Pakistan’s stance.

On Islamophobia in India, he condemned the demolition of religious sites in Uttarakhand, calling it part of a broader anti-Muslim agenda.Ambassador Khan added that the recent visit by Pakistan’s Air Chief to the US was highlighted as part of ongoing bilateral defence cooperation, despite the ten-year gap in such high-level exchanges.Responding to comments by India’s External Affairs Minister on an alleged Pakistani military threat, he said Pakistan reaffirmed its right to self-defence and condemned arbitrary threats to its sovereignty.
