The martyrdom of Imam Hussain ibn Ali (R.A.), the grandson of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), and his small group of companions against the vast forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid has inspired centuries of reflection, resistance, and remembrance.\nThis tragic episode not only holds deep religious and cultural significance but also occupies a powerful place in world literature—spanning languages, genres, and time periods. From the earliest days, poets and writers composed elegies (marsiyas) to mourn Imam Hussain (R.A.) and celebrate his virtues. These literary expressions were not only emotional laments but also forms of protest, preserving the memory of Karbala in defiance of oppressive regimes.\nIn Urdu literature, the Karbala narrative found its most refined form in marsiyas—long elegiac poems narrating the events of Ashura. Mir Anees, a 19th-century poet from Lucknow, is considered the master of this genre. His works are renowned for their vivid imagery, rhythmic excellence, and emotional intensity. Mirza Salaamat Ali Dabeer, a contemporary and literary rival of Anees, also made lasting contributions, and their poetic legacy is still alive today, especially during Muharram mourning gatherings (majalis).\nThese marsiyas are more than mere laments—they are rich dramatic texts filled with dialogue, moral reflection, and emotional depth. Imam Hussain (R.A.) is portrayed as the ideal figure of moral courage and sacrifice, while Yazid represents tyranny and injustice. The Karbala narrative in poetry remains a timeless representation of the battle between truth and falsehood.\nIn Arabic literature, poets such as Al-Farazdaq and Kumayl ibn Ziyad wrote verses that reflected deep sorrow and reverence for the martyrs. In the Persian tradition, poets like Mohtasham Kashani gave the story epic treatment, with lines such as “Again the month of Muharram has come / Again the cry of ‘Ya Hussain’ has risen” still resonating to this day.\nThe imagery of Karbala has also permeated modern political and revolutionary literature. During the Islamic Revolution of 1979 in Iran, Karbala’s symbolism was frequently invoked. The slogan “Every day is Ashura, every land is Karbala” became a rallying cry for justice and resistance.\nIn South Asia, modern poets and writers like Faiz Ahmad Faiz drew subtle parallels with Karbala in their works to critique authoritarianism and inspire social justice. Karbala became a metaphor for standing firm against oppression—regardless of era or geography.\nIn an exclusive interview with APP, Hameed Qaiser, poet, writer, and Director of Media Programmes at Nazaria-e-Pakistan Trust, emphasized the relevance of Karbala in literature today.\n“Youm-e-Ashura holds immense importance in the literary world. It teaches us to distinguish between truth and falsehood and gives us the courage to stand firmly with what is right. The sacrifice of Imam Hussain (R.A.) and his family is timeless and continues to inspire those who seek justice and truth,” he said.\nZohaib Chaudhry, Director of Planning and Promotion at the Sadequain Foundation, also shared his perspective with APP.\n“Karbala is not merely a battle. It is a historic verdict between truth and falsehood that continues to awaken the conscience of humanity. On the burning sands of Karbala, the thirsty Hussain (R.A.) taught us that real success lies in sacrifice for the sake of truth,” he said.\nHe added that Ashura reminds us that no matter how powerful falsehood may seem, the voice of truth can never be silenced.\n“Ashura teaches patience, sacrifice, and unwavering commitment to principles,” Zohaib concluded.\nTalking to APP, a spokesperson from the National Language Promotion Department (NLPD) highlighted the essential role of literature in keeping Karbala’s memory alive.\n“Literature has preserved this legacy through poems, plays, essays, and stories—not as a static historical memory but as a living, moral force. Karbala inspires us to speak against injustice, stand with the oppressed, and answer the call of our conscience,” she stated.\nShe warned that reducing Imam Hussain’s (R.A.) message to mere rituals risks diluting its powerful meaning.\n“If today’s youth, writers, and leaders truly absorb the essence of this message into their work and lives, Karbala will not remain just a memory—it will become a continuous movement. It will echo through their words and actions, reminding the world of the power of a principled stand, even in the face of death.”",
