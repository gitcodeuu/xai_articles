His philosophy remains a guiding light for all of humanity.\n“Highlighting the spiritual and moral essence of Ashura, the minister added that “The path of faith shines only through action, as taught by the grandson of the Prophet (PBUH).”\nNaqvi emphasized that Ashura is not merely a historical date but a “Center of awakening, where faith triumphed over the sword and the greatest sacrifice ensured the survival of Islam.”\nCondemning oppressive regimes, he remarked, “Yazeed was the name of arrogant power that was wiped out, while Hussain (A.S.) is an eternal symbol of truth and righteousness.”\nHe further noted that “despite being denied water, Imam Hussain (A.S.) delivered a message that continues to spiritually nourish the faithful to this day.”\nThe minister drew parallels between the forces of Yazeed and modern-day conspiracies, particularly referring to “the mischief of India”, which he alleged was working to fulfill nefarious designs.\nHe called upon the nation to “follow the luminous teachings of Imam Hussain (A.S.) to foil these evil ambitions.”\nStressing unity, Naqvi urged Pakistanis to “rise above internal divisions and stand together against false forces to safeguard the country.”\nHe concluded with a prayer: “May Allah grant us the strength to follow the path of Imam Hussain (A.S.).”\nAshura, the 10th of Muharram, commemorates the martyrdom of Imam Hussain (A.S.) and his companions in the Battle of Karbala — an event deeply revered across the Muslim world for its enduring message of sacrifice, resistance, and moral clarity.",
