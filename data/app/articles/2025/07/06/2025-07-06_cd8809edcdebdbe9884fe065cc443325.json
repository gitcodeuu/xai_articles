Imam Hussain (A.S) chose martyrdom over submission to tyranny, reminding humanity for all time that remaining silent in the face of falsehood was akin to abandoning the path of righteousness, stated a press release.\n“The message of Karbala is universal. It teaches us to embody the values of patience, perseverance, courage, and sacrifice — qualities that form the foundation of any just and humane society. As a nation and as individuals, we must reflect on these teachings and commit ourselves to uphold justice, speak out against injustice, and protect the vulnerable in every sphere of life,” he added.\n“On this sacred day, let us pledge to make these values part of our personal and collective character. Let us reaffirm our commitment to a society where truth prevails over tyranny, where human rights are protected, and where no voice is silenced by fear,” the minister concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
