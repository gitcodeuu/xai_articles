His stance has allowed both Muslims and non-Muslims to envision a just society founded on the principles introduced by the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) fourteen centuries ago in the state of Medina.Imam Hussain (A.S.) left behind a timeless legacy of courage, steadfastness, and moral integrity. He refused to submit to an unjust, corrupt, and oppressive ruler, becoming a beacon for all generations. His unmatched sacrifice conveyed a powerful message: to protect Islamic ideology, its traditions, and even its physical boundaries.A notable example of his moral foresight was his departure from Makkah after performing Umrah, to avoid bloodshed in the sacred city—a trap laid by Yazid’s forces. This reminds us of Allah’s promise in the Holy Qur’an: He is the protector of His divine message and the revered family of the Prophet (Ahle Bayt). Through the sacrifice of his family, Imam Hussain (A.S.) remains eternally alive in the heavens, illuminated by the light of divine grace.Imam Hussain (A.S.) is revered across communities, nations, sects, and ideologies for his unwavering honesty, bravery, and commitment to justice. His name continues to live in the hearts of his followers, who see in him a symbol of dignity and resistance against oppression.His journey to Karbala was undertaken for the noblest cause—upholding the true values, ethics, and righteousness of Islam. His life serves as a guiding light for his followers, teaching them to live with honor, justice, and without prejudice.It is essential that our younger generations understand the noble cause of Imam Hussain (A.S.)—his resistance to tyranny, his fight for justice, and his call to remember the values of compassion, fairness, and truth. They must stand for a just system that upholds religious freedom, human rights, women’s empowerment, child protection, and the dignity of marginalized communities.Let us keep the flag of Islam raised high—not to bow before tyrants, but to strive for a pure, just, and righteous system, as envisioned by the founding father of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, 78 years ago.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
