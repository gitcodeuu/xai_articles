  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday lauded Federal Minister for Power Sardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari for his pivotal role in energy sector reforms, called his performance a turning point in the nation’s journey toward economic resilience and energy security.\nIn a formal letter addressed to the Federal Minister, the Prime Minister extended heartfelt appreciation for Leghari’s efforts in reducing the circular debt by a staggering Rs 780 billion—bringing the total stock down to Rs 1,614 billion. He termed the achievement “Herculean,” highlighting the complex institutional coordination it required.\nThe letter also praised Leghari’s decisive role in renegotiating Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with over 35 Independent Power Producers (IPPs), including the complete termination of six costly contracts. These reforms, the Prime Minister noted, have led to an estimated national saving of Rs 3.6 trillion—an unprecedented fiscal gain.\nThe prime minister underscored the Rs 8.35 per unit reduction in power tariffs compared to the previous year, which has delivered substantial relief to households while also stimulating industrial growth. This drop in electricity prices, he emphasized, is expected to create long-term benefits across various sectors of the economy.\nPM Shehbaz Sharif also commended people-centric reforms such as the “Apna Meter, Apni Reading” initiative, calling it a progressive step toward transparent and citizen-focused governance in the energy sector.\n“I congratulate you and your team on these commendable strides, and I trust your continued efforts will further fortify Pakistan’s energy landscape and economic outlook,” the Prime Minister concluded.",
