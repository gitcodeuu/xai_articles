  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): The Sahiwal Coal-Fired Power Plant (CFPP) has surpassed its annual capacity test (ACT), generating an impressive 1252.03 MW—well above the assigned benchmark of 1243.517 MW.\nThis result, achieved during a rigorous six-hour full-load test this week, underscores the plant’s operational excellence and bolsters its role in ensuring the stability of Pakistan’s national power grid, said the focal person of Sahiwal Coal-Fired Power Plant on Thursday.\nOperated by Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Pvt. Limited, the Sahiwal Power Plant has long been considered a pillar of the country’s energy infrastructure. Since its commercial operation began in October 2017, it has consistently provided reliable power to the grid, and the latest test results further cement its status as one of Pakistan’s most efficient and dependable energy assets.\nThis year’s ACT has further solidified its status, reflecting a high level of preparedness, technical proficiency, and a proactive approach to grid responsibility by Huaneng Shandong Ruyi.\nThe annual capacity test, a vital benchmark for assessing a power plant’s ability to deliver its declared output, was conducted under the close supervision of key power sector bodies, including the Central Power Purchasing Agency – Guaranteed (CPPA-G), the Independent System and Market Operator (ISMO), and the National Grid Company (NGC). Representatives from these organizations ensured that the test adhered to national standards and regulations, providing transparency and reliability to the process.\nAmong those overseeing the test were CPPA-G’s Deputy Manager Bilal Khalid and Assistant Manager Arslan Ahmed, who monitored the plant’s performance to ensure compliance with purchasing authority guidelines. Additionally, technical officials from ISMO, including Deputy Manager Mubasher Hussain and Assistant Manager Rizwan Rahman, offered real-time evaluation of the plant’s synchronization and compatibility with the national grid. Tariq Mehmood Bhatti, Additional Manager at the 220kV Kasowal Grid Station, and Muhammad Hashim Bhatti, Deputy Manager at the 500kV Yousafwala Grid Station, also participated in overseeing the plant’s integration with regional grid systems.\nThe high level of representation from CPPA-G, ISMO, and NGC reflected the importance of the test not only for the plant itself but for Pakistan’s broader energy security. These regulatory and operational bodies, tasked with ensuring continuous and balanced supply throughout the country, praised the outcome and commended the plant’s flawless execution during the full-load test.\nThe management of Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Pvt. Limited was represented by its senior leadership, including the Chief Executive Officer, Vice President, and the Directors of Health, Safety & Environment (HSE) and Operations departments. Their presence at the site during the test symbolized the strategic importance placed on continuous performance monitoring, stakeholder engagement, and operational transparency.\nThe Vice President of the company praised the plant’s technical team for their role in delivering this outstanding performance, stating, “This achievement not only highlights our team’s technical prowess but also reaffirms our dedication to providing a stable and reliable power supply to the national grid.”\nOfficials from ISMO and NGC lauded the plant’s ability to supply both active and reactive power, crucial for maintaining voltage regulation and frequency control in the grid. These capabilities are vital for ensuring grid stability during peak demand periods, when fluctuations in power generation and consumption can pose challenges. By enhancing its reactive power capability, the plant has played a key role in reducing transmission stress, improving frequency control, and mitigating power disruptions.\nThe seamless integration of the Sahiwal Power Plant with the national grid was also praised by officials from the Yousafwala and Kasowal grid stations. They noted the plant’s direct positive impact on regional grid health, adding that the improved reactive power capability observed during the test contributes significantly to reducing transmission stress and enhancing frequency control measures. These factors are vital in ensuring uninterrupted power delivery across residential, industrial, and agricultural sectors.\nWith over 7 years of successful commercial operations, the Sahiwal Power Plant remains a shining example of China-Pakistan collaboration under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) umbrella. Huaneng Shandong Ruyi has remained committed to ensuring the plant’s long-term success by investing in technical training, system upgrades, and digital monitoring tools that enhance both performance and compliance with national power sector regulations.\nThe plant’s performance during the ACT also demonstrates its readiness to adapt and align with national grid demands, ensuring that it can support Pakistan’s future energy landscape while continuing to meet current capacity needs. Huaneng Shandong Ruyi’s management reiterated its dedication to investing in technical training, system upgrades, and digital monitoring systems that further enhance reliability, efficiency, and compliance with national power sector regulations.\nThe successful completion of the capacity test was not just a regulatory formality—it was a vivid illustration of teamwork, technical excellence, and a shared vision for Pakistan’s energy future. It reinforced the critical role played by Sahiwal Power Plant in maintaining a stable and sustainable electricity supply. From CPPA-G and ISMO to the grid station teams and the plant operators, the coordinated effort and mutual accountability demonstrated during the ACT stand as a model for others in the industry.\nAs Pakistan continues to strengthen its power infrastructure to support economic growth, the role of high-performing plants like Sahiwal becomes even more vital. Through strategic oversight, skilled manpower, and consistent performance, Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Pvt. Limited is not just powering homes and industries—it is powering the future of a nation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
