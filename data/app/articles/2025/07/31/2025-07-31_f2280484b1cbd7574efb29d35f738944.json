  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): Vice President of the Pakistan Peoples Party, Senator Sherry Rehman has strongly condemned the dumping of rotting meat and animal waste in Rawalpindi’s stormwater drains, calling it a dangerous act of environmental vandalism.\n“What we are witnessing in Rawalpindi is far more than civic irresponsibility, it is environmental sabotage,” she said in a statement. “Throwing rotting meat and animal remains into storm drains is not only generating unbearable stench and breeding disease, it is laying the groundwork for devastating urban floods.”\nSenator Rehman emphasized that blocking natural drainage systems dismantles the very protections nature has built against floods. “These drains are not garbage bins. In a climate-vulnerable country like Pakistan, they are lifelines. Clogging them means sabotaging our own survival.”\nShe stressed that climate change is no longer a distant or abstract threat. “It’s not just about melting glaciers or receding snow caps. Climate change has come to our streets, our homes, and our daily lives. The filth choking our drains today is the flood knocking on our doors tomorrow.”\nSenator Rehman reminded that Pakistan remains ranked number one on the Global Climate Risk Index, yet there is a glaring disconnect between the scale of the crisis and everyday civic behavior. “We can no longer afford to be blind to the consequences of our actions. Environmental degradation is no longer just a global agenda item, it’s a local emergency.”\nCalling for urgent action, she said, “Environmental policy must not stay confined to conferences or paperwork. It must be implemented with urgency and accountability. Those polluting public waterways must face consequences so that this behaviour does not become normalized.”",
