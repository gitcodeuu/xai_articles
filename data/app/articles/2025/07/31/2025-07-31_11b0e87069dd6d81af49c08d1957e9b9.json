Both sides emphasized that the IWT is of immense importance for the people of Pakistan, serving as a crucial source of water and a lifeline. Any politically motivated decision to alter or stop the flow of Indus waters would be regarded as an act of war and would be met with an appropriate response.\nIn this regard, the President of SCBAP proposed organizing seminars and conferences not only in the UK and Pakistan but also in other capitals around the world so as to address this pressing issue and effectively present Pakistan’s perspectives on the global stage, fostering greater understanding and engagement with key international audiences regarding the IWT.\nAdditionally, the delegation led by the President SCBAP asserted that Pakistan is a peace-loving nation that abhors terrorism in any form or manifestation. Both sides emphasized that Pakistan’s commitment to international peace should not be misconstrued by our adversaries as an opportunity for aggression against her.\nAt this juncture, the President SCBAP also praised the role of the Pakistani diaspora in the development and progress of the UK. He also appreciated the role of Pakistani lawyers in UK, in this regard. He urged the Pakistani High Commission to enhance support for the Pakistani community in the UK by facilitating their needs and introducing streamlined online platforms to address their queries efficiently.\nThe President SCBAP also called upon the relevant authorities in Pakistan, particularly the Foreign Office, to take concrete steps to support and empower diaspora communities worldwide, ensuring their concerns are addressed and their contributions recognized.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
