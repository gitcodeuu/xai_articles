The broad participation reflected a united commitment to creating inclusive and sustainable economic opportunities for women.\nA highlight of both days was the exhibition of women-led small and medium enterprises (SMEs) supported by the GRASP project. Showcasing ventures in agriculture, livestock, food processing, and traditional crafts, the stalls demonstrated the innovation and resilience of Balochistan’s women entrepreneurs.\nVisiting the exhibition, the Governor praised the entrepreneurial spirit of rural women and stressed the need for continued institutional and policy support.\nThe Speaker of the Balochistan Assembly echoed this sentiment, saying that empowering women is not only a social priority but an economic necessity.\nThe seminars emphasized building ecosystems that give women equal access to finance, digital tools, training, markets, land ownership, and gender-sensitive policies. Discussions also focused on integrating entrepreneurship and vocational skills into the education system to enable women to lead in various sectors.\nFederal Minister for Education and Professional Training stated, “Education is the foundation of empowerment. By linking learning with entrepreneurship, we equip women not just to earn, but to lead.”\nFederal Minister for Poverty Alleviation added, “Empowerment begins at the grassroots. When women have access to tools, knowledge, and ownership, they uplift entire communities.”\nDeputy Speaker Ghazala Gola stressed the need for data-backed legislation and strategic budgeting to support rural women, while the Advisor to the Chief Minister on Women Development called for system-wide planning to place women at the heart of digital and agricultural development.\nSenior government officials, including the Director General of Public Relations and secretaries of Women Development, Agriculture, and Planning departments, also addressed the event.\nThe Secretary of Women’s Development said the department was aligned with government goals for inclusive growth, while the Agriculture Secretary acknowledged the historical under-recognition of women’s contributions and vowed to make the sector more gender-inclusive.\nAcademics and researchers added depth to the discussions by providing evidence-based insights on policy gaps, gender equity, and market access, reinforcing the need for long-term reforms.\nThe two-day seminar served as a platform for cross-sector collaboration and policy momentum, reaffirming the commitment to building a more inclusive and sustainable economic future for women across Balochistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
