The launch marks a major milestone in the country’s space journey and strengthens its position in Earth observation capabilities.\nThe project is the result of a strategic collaboration between the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO), China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC), and MICROSAT China, said a news release on Thursday.\nEquipped with advanced imaging technology, the Remote Sensing Satellite will significantly contribute to urban planning, precision agriculture, disaster management, environmental protection, and food security.\nIt is expected to aid in tracking deforestation, glacier recession, and climate change, while also enhancing management of water resources and agricultural land.\nThe satellite will also play a crucial role in infrastructure monitoring, mapping transportation networks, and supporting regional planning efforts, particularly in connection with national development projects like the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). It is designed to help identify geohazard risks and provide timely warnings for natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, and landslides.\nOn this occasion, Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal congratulated the nation on the successful launch of the Remote Sensing Satellite.\nHe extended warm felicitations to the entire team at SUPARCO, including its engineers and scientists, for achieving this remarkable feat.\n“We are deeply grateful to China for its unwavering support and cooperation in this project,” said Ahsan Iqbal.\nHe confirmed that the satellite has successfully entered its designated orbit and will soon begin delivering critical data for national use.\nHe further stated, “We are committed to restoring Pakistan’s leadership in space technology. With China’s help, we plan to send a Pakistani astronaut into space next year. By 2035, we will also successfully complete our lunar mission and land on the moon.”\nChairman SUPARCO, Mohammad Yousaf Khan emphasized that the launch lays the foundation for a robust and integrated Earth Observation System.\nHe said the new satellite will serve national priorities and contribute meaningfully to Pakistan’s sustainable socio-economic development.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
