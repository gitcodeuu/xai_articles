Calling him a dynamic and visionary statesman, the President said the late leader not only led the freedom movement but also represented the Kashmir cause effectively at the United Nations.\nRecalling his personal association with Ghazi-e-Millat, President Sultan said, “I had the honour and privilege of working under his guidance for five years.” He noted that during that time, several major development initiatives were launched, including the Jagran Hydel Power Project, which still contributes billions of rupees in revenue to the state.\nReaffirming his commitment, the AJK President pledged to continue advocating for Kashmir’s right to self-determination and exposing India’s human rights abuses in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) on international forums.\nMeanwhile, AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Anwar ul Haq, in a special statement, said that Ghazi-e-Millat’s mission was to liberate Kashmiri Muslims from Dogra rule and unite the region with Pakistan according to the aspirations of the people. “His mission is still alive and will continue until Kashmir’s freedom and the completion of Pakistan,” the Prime Minister declared.\nHe praised Sardar Ibrahim Khan for leading a life of principle and resilience from 1915 to 2003, never compromising on his values. “His personality is an inseparable part of the Kashmir freedom movement,” the Prime Minister said, adding that Ghazi-e-Millat played a key leadership role both militarily and politically.\nHighlighting the historic event of July 19, 1947, he said when Muslims were not even allowed to gather in Srinagar, Sardar Ibrahim Khan passed the Resolution of Accession to Pakistan from his residence, shaping the future of the Kashmiri nation. “Today, the people of occupied Kashmir are carrying forward that vision, resisting Indian repression with unwavering resolve,” he added.\nThe AJK Prime Minister emphasized that Kashmiris have never compromised on their identity or right to self-determination and will continue their struggle until complete freedom is achieved.",
