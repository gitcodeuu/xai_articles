The court took a break to wait for the written plea.\nWhen the hearing resumed, the exemption request was submitted. After reviewing the application, the court accepted the plea and granted temporary exemption to Gandapur from attending the hearing.\nThe court also directed that arguments on Gandapur’s statement under Section 342 and his acquittal request be presented at the next hearing. The case was adjourned until September 6.\nThe case against Gandapur was registered at the Bara Kahu Police Station and involves allegations related to possession of alcohol and illegal arms.
