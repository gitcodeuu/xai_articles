  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP):Authorities closed the spillways of Rawal Dam on Thursday after a brief water release operation triggered by a rise in water levels due to rainfall in Islamabad and nearby areas.\nAccording to the spokesman of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, water levels in Rawal Dam increased following rainfall in the federal capital and surrounding areas, prompting officials to open the spillways at 6 a.m. when the dam’s level reached 1,750 feet.\nThe controlled release of water from the dam continued for six hours. Once the level dropped to 1,749 feet, the spillways were shut down to prevent further outflow, he added.\nBefore the spillways were opened, relevant departments, including Rescue 1122, were stationed at bridges, streams, and low-lying areas to ensure safety and monitor any potential risks from the discharge.\nAssistant Commissioner Nilore supervised the entire operation, including water flow and public safety arrangements.\nThe move is part of standard procedures followed during monsoon rains to manage dam capacity and reduce the chance of overflow.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
