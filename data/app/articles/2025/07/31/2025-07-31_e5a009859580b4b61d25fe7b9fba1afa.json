  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): Chairman of Islamabad Transport Authority (ITA) Irfan Memon on Thursday visited inspection site of Vehicle Emission Testing System to review progress and urged the public to support the campaign.\nIn a move to address the increasing air pollution, vehicle inspections under the Islamabad Vehicle Emission Testing System are continuing on a daily basis to reduce harmful emissions from road traffic.\nOfficials from the ITA and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) briefed the Chairman on the ongoing drive.\nAccording to the briefing, a total of 237 vehicles were checked for emission levels during the day. Out of these, 214 vehicles met the required standards and were cleared. However, 21 vehicles failed the inspection due to excessive emissions and will need corrective action before being allowed to operate further.\nMemon clarified that in the initial phase, vehicles manufactured in 2021 or later are not required to undergo testing. However, he added that this exemption is temporary and may be reviewed in the future. He also warned that vehicles found operating without a valid emission certificate in the coming months could face restrictions or removal from roads.\nSpeaking at the site, Memon urged citizens to cooperate with the emission testing program and contribute to improving Islamabad’s air quality. He stressed that reducing pollution is not only the responsibility of the government but also of vehicle owners and the public at large.\nThe inspection system is part of a broader effort to monitor and regulate air quality in the capital. The ITA is working closely with EPA to ensure vehicles comply with environmental standards aimed at controlling smog and other airborne pollutants.\nDaily inspections are being conducted at multiple locations across the city. Officials said that the data collected through these tests is helping authorities better understand emission patterns and enforce regulations more effectively.\nThe Transport Authority also plans to gradually expand the scope of the program to include a larger number of vehicles, especially older models that are more likely to contribute to pollution.\nResidents have been advised to keep their vehicles properly maintained and ensure regular servicing to reduce emissions. Vehicle owners can get their cars checked at designated inspection centers to receive an emission clearance certificate.\nThe initiative is part of the Islamabad administration’s broader clean air strategy, which includes stricter checks on industrial emissions and waste burning, alongside improved traffic management.\nThe campaign will continue in the coming weeks with the aim of creating a more sustainable and healthier environment for the city’s residents.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
