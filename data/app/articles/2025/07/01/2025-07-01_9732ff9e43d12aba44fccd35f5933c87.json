  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP):After remaining stalled for over a decade, construction on the long-delayed Model Jail project in Islamabad has finally gained momentum.\nFederal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi visited the under-construction facility in Sector H-16 on Tuesday and issued a clear directive to complete the first phase of the project within the current year.\nAccompanied by Minister of State Talal Chaudhry, Naqvi inspected various parts of the site and reviewed the pace of development work. During the visit, he stressed that construction activities must continue day and night to meet the deadline.\nAccording to officials, two barracks have already been completed, while security check posts and the central watchtower are nearing completion. In the first phase, the jail will be able to accommodate 1,500 prisoners. Naqvi further instructed that two additional barracks be constructed within the next 90 days.\nThe minister also ordered the rapid completion of a 34-bed hospital and the jail’s main kitchen, emphasizing the importance of fully functional facilities before operations begin. He directed the DIG Islamabad Police to present a comprehensive staffing plan for the jail.\nThe Model Jail project was originally launched in 2011 but has seen repeated delays due to administrative and logistical hurdles. Officials present at the site briefing included the Federal Secretary for Interior, DIG Islamabad Police, Deputy Commissioner, Additional Deputy Commissioner General, CDA representatives, contractors, and project consultants.\nWith the government now pushing for swift progress, authorities hope to deliver a modern correctional facility that meets international standards and helps decongest existing prisons in the capital.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
