  "content": "LAHORE, Jul 01 (APP):Railways Minister Hanif Abbasi has said that the government is committed to transform the Pakistan Railways through structural reforms, improved public services and a strong focus on workers’ welfare.\nHe emphasized that these reforms aim not only to modernize the railways but also to restore dignity and rights of its dedicated workforce, especially the long-neglected porters (coolies) and low-grade employees.\nHe expressed these views while launching a welfare initiative for railway porters, formalized through an Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Pakistan Railways and Akhuwat Islamic Microfinance at the Lahore Railway Station on Tuesday, offering interest-free loans of up to Rs 50,000.\nUnder the agreement, registered porters with a minimum of two years of service will be eligible to receive loans, repayable over 20 monthly installments. The scheme includes a death coverage benefit, whereby porters contributing an additional 1 per cent above their monthly installment will be provided with death insurance by the Pakistan Railways.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Hanif Abbasi said that the railways could be transformed through comprehensive reforms and pro-worker policies.\n“We are determined to revamp railways and improve lives of those who serve it,” he said.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif committed to develop the institution, pulling the country out of crisis, and defeating every challenge, economic or external, he added.\nThe railways minister also announced that Rs 4 million had been allocated for the welfare of Railway Police constables from Grade 1 to 5, and that porters at major stations, including Rawalpindi, Karachi, Multan, and Khanewal, will benefit from this interest-free loan scheme.\nHe assured that luxury saloons would no longer be used for unofficial or personal purposes. Railway officers will use these facilities for inspection only, not for joyrides. These are public assets and should be made available to the public on rent, he said. He mentioned that locally manufactured coaches, based on Chinese technology, were part of the modernization efforts.\nReflecting on national affairs, Hanif Abbasi credited Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif for saving the country from default during the tenure of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) government. “When the PDM took over, many called it a political mistake. But someone had to step forward to save the country, and we did. Our armed forces gave a historic response to enemy attacks that the world will remember, he remarked.\nOn the occasion, Akhuwat Chairman Dr Amjad Saqib called the porters “unsung heroes” who carry the burdens of society. He announced that, in the first phase, 150 registered porters will be granted Rs 50,000 each from an initial pool of Rs 4 million. These funds will help them cover educational expenses, family needs, or invest in small business tools.\nDr Amjad Saqib added that Akhuwat had already disbursed over Rs 300 billion in interest-free loans to more than 4 million families, and this partnership with the Pakistan Railways marks the beginning of a dedicated nationwide support system for railway workers. “If a porter’s son or daughter passes intermediate and wants to pursue computer training, we will provide free three-month computer courses,” he announced. He clarified that only porters who are officially registered with the railway department for over two years will qualify under the MoU.\nHe said the Akhuwat Foundation was striving to improve the economic well-being of porters and restore their dignity through meaningful and sustainable empowerment.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
