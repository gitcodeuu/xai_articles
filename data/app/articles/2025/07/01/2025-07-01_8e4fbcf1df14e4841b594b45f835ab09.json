We have a great capital of civilization and culture, of which the entire nation is rightly proud. The government is not considering implementing any proposal to close or merge national institutions of scientific, literary, historical and cultural importance. On the contrary, we will try to make these institutions more strong, effective and efficient,” PM Shehbaz Sharif said.\nSenator Siddiqui, who has long been associated with the country’s literary and academic community, conveyed the deep concerns of scholars, writers, poets, and artists regarding the recommendations of the government’s Rightsizing Committee.
