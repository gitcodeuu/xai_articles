  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP):In a landmark shift in Pakistan’s identity system, NADRA has, for the first time, declared the Family Registration Certificate (FRC) a legal document following Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi’s recommendation and Federal Cabinet approval.\nThis change brings the FRC into the same legal category as other core identity documents such as the Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) and the Child Registration Certificate (B-Form), NADRA’s Spokesperson and Director Public Engagement, Syed Shabahat Ali told APP.\nPreviously, the FRC was used merely as a reference for family composition and was not enforceable in legal terms. Now, under new rules, providing false or misleading information on an FRC can lead to criminal charges. This accountability measure is aimed at preventing fraudulent claims and reinforcing the integrity of identity data in the national registry.\nAnother major change introduced is the requirement for applicants to verify their entire family tree when applying for an FRC.\nIndividuals will now be shown a complete list of their family members as recorded in NADRA’s database.\nIf the information is correct, they will verify it through a signed declaration, known as affidevit “Bayan-e-Halfi”. This process ensures that all individuals named in the certificate are validated by the applicant themselves.\nMoreover, the reforms allow family members to be added to the FRC even if they are not physically present. This means that if a family member is abroad or otherwise unavailable, they can still be included based on the applicant’s information, provided that necessary identification details are submitted. NADRA officials will then process the request and determine its validity through internal checks.\nA notable provision has been made to address the realities of polygamous marriages. Under the new framework, if a person has more than one wife, all spouses and their children must appear in the FRC. This ensures that no woman’s rights are sidelined and that every child is properly linked to their biological mother, thereby maintaining the integrity of family data.\nIn another development, NADRA has made it possible for individuals to obtain a certificate that includes both their birth family and married family referred to in internal terms as Alpha and Beta compositions, on a single document. This is particularly useful for legal matters, travel documentation, and inheritance claims.\nDespite the sweeping reforms, NADRA has announced that there will be no increase in the application fee. The cost remains Rs. 1,000 for either the Alpha or Beta version, and Rs. 2,000 for the combined certificate.\nMarried women stand to benefit significantly from these changes. Under the new rules, women who wish to retain their father’s name on their CNIC after marriage can now do so without facing administrative hurdles. Previously, such women were often required to update their records to reflect their husband’s name before applying for official documents like passports. This reform reinforces a woman’s autonomy in choosing how her identity is recorded.\nIn addition to reforms in family registration, NADRA has also upgraded its Teslan card—the non-chip version of the CNIC. These cards will now include English spellings of names alongside Urdu, making them valid for passport applications and other services that require English documentation. A QR code has been added to the card, enabling users to link it to the digital wallet on the Pak Identity mobile application. The card’s delivery time has also been shortened to 5–15 days, and the fee structure remains unchanged. Importantly, first-time applicants will continue to receive this card free of cost.\nTo make the process even more accessible, citizens can now view their family composition online through NADRA’s Pak Identity app. After biometric verification through fingerprint submission, users can check their registered family details without visiting a NADRA center. If a citizen finds an error,such as an incorrect addition to the family, they can report it via NADRA’s complaint portal (complaints.nadra.gov.pk) or by calling the helpline at 1777.\nNADRA officials have also confirmed that agents on the helpline are authorized to lodge complaints on behalf of users who are unable to access online services.\nCitizens who previously obtained identification documents through false declarations have been given a unique opportunity under these reforms. NADRA has opened a one-time amnesty window where individuals can voluntarily surrender fraudulently obtained documents, be it CNICs, Child Registration Certificates, or juvenile cards without facing any legal consequences. Officials emphasized that those who come forward voluntarily will not be prosecuted, but this offer may not last indefinitely.\nTo reduce delays in identity verification processes, NADRA has also introduced a new timeline for decisions. Once an individual has submitted all required documents, the relevant NADRA officer must issue a decision within 30 days. This time-bound approach aims to curb bureaucratic inefficiency and ensure quicker resolutions for applicants.\nFurthermore, NADRA has standardized the definition of “biometric” information. Biometric data is now officially defined as any personal information based on physical or behavioral characteristics such as fingerprints, iris scans, or facial photos that can be used to identify a person. This definition is expected to be adopted by other regulatory bodies, including the State Bank of Pakistan, the Federal Board of Revenue, and the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority.\nThese sweeping reforms, guided by the Ministry of Interior under Mohsin Naqvi, reflect NADRA’s commitment to closing loopholes, empowering citizens—especially women—and increasing the accuracy and accessibility of identity data in Pakistan.\nAs implementation continues, citizens are urged to review their family records and correct any discrepancies to avoid future legal complications.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
