He was accompanied by the Additional Secretary of Health and the Joint Secretary of Health.\nThe Chief Executive Officer, Federal Sehat Sahulat Program Muhammad Arshad and the Divisional Head (H&AI) of State Life Insurance Corporation of Pakistan Muhammad Ashar gave a briefing on the functions and operations of the data centre.\nThe Minister also toured the E-Claims Centre.\nThe CEO, SSP informed that Sehat Sahulat Program has introduced a paperless environment through digitalization of the program since day one and is using CNIC as Universal Medical Record.\nMustafa Kamal stated that Pakistan currently lacks a Universal Medical Record system, making it difficult to trace a patient’s medical history.\nHe emphasized the need to develop a Universal Medical Record system for non-Sehat Card patients as well within the National Database of the Sehat Sahulat Program, where every citizen’s Computerised National Identity Card (CNIC) number would serve as their medical record number.\nThis would allow real-time, comprehensive health data of all 240 million citizens of Pakistan to be recorded and accessed.\nHe stated that such a system would significantly improve access to healthcare, enabling doctors to instantly retrieve patients’ medical histories, which in turn facilitates timely diagnosis and treatment.\nHe said that quick access to accurate healthcare data leads to better health outcomes and that comprehensive and authentic health data would support the Ministry in formulating more effective public health policies.\nThe minister appreciated the efforts of Federal Sehat Sahulat Program and State Life teams for their wonderful work.",
