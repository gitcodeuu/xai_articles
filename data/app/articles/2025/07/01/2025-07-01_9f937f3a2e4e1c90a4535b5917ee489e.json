Research Institute of Chemistry, Karachi), Dr. Bibi Amna (Quaid-i-Azam University, Islamabad), Dr. Tabassum Malik (University of Peshawar), and Palwasha Khan (COMSATS University, Lahore Campus).\nIt is pertinent to mention that 278 applications were received for this year’s meeting. After a rigorous selection process, 10 candidates were shortlisted for nomination to the Lindau Council. In March 2025, the Lindau Council finalized the selection of five scholars.\nFurthermore, a special training camp was held at PIEAS on June 26, presided over by Rector PIEAS Dr. Naseem Irfan. The camp was also attended by Dr. N.M. Butt, the program’s founder since 2003.\nThe purpose of this camp was to brief the participating scholars on the activities of the Nobel Laureate Meeting and prepare them to derive maximum benefit from the experience.\nIt is important to note that since 2003, 22 Pakistani delegations have participated in this meeting, serving as a shining example of science promotion in the country. The primary objective of the program is to encourage young scientists to pursue research careers through dialogue with Nobel Laureates.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
