  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 01 (APP):Tehzeeb Hussain Bercha, a freelance journalist and columnist from Gilgit-Baltistan, Pakistan, proudly represented his country at Eurasia Global 2025, one of the world’s premier international youth forums, held in Orenburg, Russia.\nBercha was the sole delegate from Pakistan among more than 300 young leaders representing 110 countries and over 80 regions of the Russian Federation. His participation at the high-profile event underscores the growing role of Pakistani youth in global conversations on peace, media, and sustainability, said a press release received here on Tuesday.\nEurasia Global is organized annually by the Russian Federal Agency for Youth Affairs (Rosmolodezh) in collaboration with the Government of the Orenburg Region and the Directorate of the World Youth Festival. The forum serves as a platform for youth from around the globe to engage in intercultural dialogue, develop international cooperation, and explore solutions to shared global challenges.\nSpeaking to various Russian media outlets during the forum,  Bercha emphasized the critical need for youth involvement in shaping a more peaceful and multipolar world.\n“In light of increasing global challenges such as geopolitical tensions, climate change, and the erosion of trust between nations, youth must emerge as proactive leaders. We are the future, and it is our responsibility to contribute meaningfully to peacebuilding, sustainability, and international dialogue,” he stated.\nHe further highlighted the double-edged role of media in the modern world: “Media, when used responsibly, is a powerful instrument of diplomacy and dialogue. However, in today’s world order, it is also often misused by some powers to manipulate narratives and spread disinformation. It is imperative for young journalists and communicators to reclaim media as a tool for truth, understanding, and global cooperation.”\nMr. Bercha’s participation at Eurasia Global 2025 not only marks a proud moment for Pakistan on the international stage but also strengthens the message that the country’s youth are ready to contribute to the global discourse on peace, development, and responsible media.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
