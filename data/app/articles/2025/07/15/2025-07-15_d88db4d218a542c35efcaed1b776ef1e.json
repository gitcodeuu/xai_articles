The event brought together Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan, Akamatsu Shuichi, FAO Representative in Pakistan, Florence Rolle, and senior representatives from national and provincial partners.\n“The Government of Japan has always prioritized human security in its development cooperation,” said Ambassador Akamatsu, adding, “This project reflects our commitment to helping the people of Pakistan recover from the devastating floods and rebuild their lives through practical and sustainable agricultural support.”\nFAO’s response involved the distribution of seeds, fertilizers, and training to help families restart food production. Over 14,000 households received inputs for vegetable and field crop cultivation, while 1,500 hectares of agricultural land were rehabilitated. As a result, farming families were able to grow a wide range of crops, including wheat, rice, maize, okra, brinjal, and tomatoes, improving food availability and income opportunities.\nSupport to livestock-owning families included the distribution of animal feed, mineral blocks, poultry, and small ruminants, along with the construction of animal shelters and a mass vaccination campaign that reached more than 629,000 animals, benefiting 35,000 households.\nSpecial focus was given to female-headed households, who received livestock and poultry packages along with training in animal care and poultry production to help diversify and stabilize their incomes.\n“This project made a real difference in the lives of rural communities that lost nearly everything to the floods,” said Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan. “With Japan’s timely support, families not only regained their ability to produce food but also strengthened their resilience against future shocks.”\nImplemented in close coordination with the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, disaster management authorities, and non-governmental partners, the project also helped enhance local knowledge of climate-smart practices, food security planning, and livestock management—laying the foundation for more resilient rural systems in the future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
