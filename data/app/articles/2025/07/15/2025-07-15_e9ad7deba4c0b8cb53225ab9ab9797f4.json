  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP): The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has approved the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) application for reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly, following the announcement of its reserved judgment issued earlier this week.\nAs per the latest seat allocations, both PML-N and Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) have been granted nine reserved seats each. In a further boost to its representation, PML-N has also secured a minority seat.\nThe Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) has been allotted five reserved seats, while PTI Parliamentarians and the Awami National Party (ANP) have each obtained one additional seat in the provincial legislature.\nHowever, two seats remain undecided and will be settled through a draw. One minority seat will be contested between PML-N and JUI-F, and a reserved women’s seat will be determined by a toss between ANP and PTI Parliamentarians.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
