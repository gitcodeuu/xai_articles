  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):The British Council has announced a free three-day online professional development conference for English language teachers across South Asia, set to take place from 17 to 19 July 2025. The South Asia TeachingEnglish Online Conference 2025 invites primary and secondary school educators to engage in a rich and dynamic learning experience focused on current trends and future directions in English language teaching.\nCentred around the theme “Supporting Teachers’ Professional Development,” the event will feature nine expert-led sessions, including three panel discussions. The sessions are designed to equip teachers with practical strategies and deeper understanding of three core themes: inclusive education, integration of 21st-century skills, and the transformative use of digital technology and artificial intelligence in English classrooms.\nThe conference opens with a focus on inclusive practices, guiding teachers on how to create classrooms where every learner—regardless of background or ability—feels supported and valued. Sessions will offer actionable insights on designing equitable learning environments and teaching strategies that cater to diverse needs.\nThe second theme addresses the incorporation of 21st-century skills into language education, encouraging teachers to nurture students’ critical thinking, collaboration, creativity, and global citizenship. These skills, considered essential for success in an increasingly complex and interconnected world, will be explored through real classroom examples and regional best practices.\nThe third and final theme looks at the role of digital technologies and artificial intelligence in enhancing both teaching and learning. With tools ranging from AI-assisted lesson planning to interactive online learning environments, the conference aims to give teachers a toolkit of strategies to meaningfully engage their students using technology. The sessions will also demystify the role of AI in education and demonstrate how it can be used inclusively and responsibly.\nSpeakers at the conference include renowned education experts from Pakistan, India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the UK, and Greece. With backgrounds ranging from grassroots teaching to international consultancy, they bring a wealth of knowledge and experience grounded in local contexts. Notable names include Amena Ahmed (Pakistan), who leads textbook reform and inclusive learning initiatives; Nahid Ferdous Bhuiyan (Bangladesh), a leading TESOL trainer and AI integration specialist; and Dr. Bimali Indrarathne (Sri Lanka), a global authority on dyslexia and inclusive education.\nBritish Council South Asia Director of English and School Education, Sarah Rogerson, said the event is timely and critical for teachers navigating new challenges in education. “As we navigate an educational landscape transformed by technology and diversity, our focus remains clear: every teacher must feel equipped to make English learning inclusive, meaningful, and future-ready. True innovation comes not from tools alone, but from empathy, reflection, and a commitment to reaching every learner,” she said.\nBritish Council Pakistan Country Director James Hampson added that the conference offers teachers a rare opportunity to connect with global expertise and stay at the forefront of change. “We’re helping teachers of English from Pakistan and across South Asia by connecting them to world-class expertise. This Conference will introduce new ideas, new technologies, and new skills which will benefit millions of students they teach today and into the future.”\nEducators attending the conference will also receive e-certificates for each session. The event not only aims to build teachers’ knowledge and capacity but also foster regional collaboration and inspire a shared vision for the future of English language teaching.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
