  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP): Minister of State for Interior Talal Chaudhry on Tuesday informed the Senate that the federal government has launched a comprehensive plan to tackle the worsening water shortage in the federal capital, including mandatory installation of rainwater recharge wells in new housing projects and the establishment of a high-level task force to develop a sustainable water supply strategy.\nResponding to a question raised by Senator Fawzia Arshad, the minister stated that Islamabad’s current daily water demand is estimated at 120 million gallons, while the available supply stands between 65 and 80 million gallons.\nThe supply is sourced from a combination of dams and tube wells. However, the underground water table has seen a significant decline due to over-extraction, particularly from tube wells.\nTo mitigate the shortfall, new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are being formulated to make rainwater recharge wells mandatory in all new constructions, especially residential units. The initiative aims to facilitate groundwater replenishment and stabilize falling water levels.\nChaudhry further said that a task force has been constituted by the Prime Minister, headed by the Interior Minister and co-chaired by Dr Tauqir, with participation from federal departments and elected representatives of the area. The task force is working on a master plan for Islamabad’s long-term water security.\nAs part of the plan, feasibility studies for four dam sites—Tarbela, Chiniot, Shahdara, and others —have been initiated. The Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) has been tasked with conducting these studies, and the first tender is expected to be floated shortly.\nOriginally, the feasibility process was expected to take 18 months. However, the committee overseeing the project has recommended reducing the timeline to six months. Meetings of the task force are being held every 15 days, with two already completed.\nTerming the issue “longstanding but now receiving focused attention,” Senator Talal Chaudhry assured that measurable progress would be visible within the current year.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
