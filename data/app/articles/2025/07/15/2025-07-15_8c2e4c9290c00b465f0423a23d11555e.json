  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Dr. Musadik Malik, has reiterated Pakistan’s firm commitment to developing a transparent, inclusive, and future-ready carbon market aligned with the global climate agenda.\nSpeaking during a high-level meeting with the delegation of SPAR6C (Supporting Preparedness for Article 6 Cooperation), on Tuesday, Dr. Malik said that Pakistan is determined to strengthen its institutional and technical readiness to participate effectively in international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.\n“Pakistan is fully committed to building a carbon market that is not only environmentally sound but also economically empowering,” the minister said. “We believe transparency, credibility, and inclusivity must be at the heart of this system — and we are taking the necessary steps to ensure this.”\nHe emphasized the importance of aligning national efforts with global best practices and deepening partnerships with both international collaborators and the domestic private sector.\n“The collaboration with SPAR6C is a valuable opportunity to learn, adapt, and implement mechanisms that work for our economy, our climate goals, and our people,” Dr. Malik noted.\nThe Minister also highlighted the critical role of youth and academia in shaping Pakistan’s carbon market future, particularly through the SPAR6C-sponsored student research program.\n“The expertise of our young professionals must be channeled into real-world solutions. This is not just a technical agenda—it’s a development opportunity.”\nDr. Malik’s remarks come at a time when Pakistan is intensifying efforts to access global climate finance, scale up low-carbon projects, and attract investment through international emissions trading systems.\n“By investing in our readiness today, we are creating opportunities for sustainable economic growth, climate resilience, and global cooperation tomorrow,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
