Additionally, a Grant Agreement outlining the implementation details of the project for fiscal year 2025 was signed between Chief Representative of the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) in Pakistan, Naoaki MIYATA and, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Miran Mohiyuddin Soomro.\nThe JDS Program is part of Japan’s commitment to strengthen the administrative capacities of the government of Pakistan which was initiated in 2018. The program offers highly capable Pakistani government officers the opportunity to pursue Master’s and Ph.D. degrees at leading Japanese universities. These officers are selected from those involved in planning and implementing social and economic development policies.\nThrough the JDS Program JICA has so far sent over hundred government officers to Japan, out of which nearly 70 scholars have successfully completed their studies and returned to Pakistan, contributing their enhanced knowledge and skills to the country’s development. The focus areas of study under this program include public administration and finance (Disciplines of Public Policy and Development Studies), Industrial Promotion and Investment Climate, Energy Policy and Response to Climate Change and Agribusiness and Food Security.\nOn this occasion, Ambassador AKAMATSU stated, “The Government of Japan fully understands the importance of social and human capital development in Pakistan and believes among the key enablers is a responsive and accountable public administration. Building the capacity of young outstanding civil servants in various technical areas is thus imperative in strengthening public administration that can effectively address the multi-dimensional development challenges in this country.”\nNaoaki MIYATA, added, “This program will make a significant contribution to human resource development in Pakistan. JDS fellows will acquire advanced knowledge and skills which will enhance their capacities in policy planning and implementation. We believe these individuals will play pivotal leadership roles within the Government of Pakistan, contributing to national development and the well-being of the people. Moreover, the JDS Program is a testament to the enduring partnership and friendship between Japan and Pakistan.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
