  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 15 (APP):The Turkish Cooperation and Coordination Agency (TIKA) on Tuesday planted 253 saplings at Fatima Jinnah Park in the federal capital – each symbolizing a life lost in the defense of democracy in a poignant tribute to the martyrs of the failed 2016 coup attempt in Turkiye.\nThe tree plantation drive, held in collaboration with the Capital Development Authority (CDA), was organized to commemorate Turkiye’s Democracy and National Unity Day, and drew the participation of Turkish Ambassador Dr Irfan Neziroglu, diplomats, senior Pakistani officials and members of civil society.\nDespite the rainy weather, the ceremony resonated with a spirit of unity and shared resolve between the people of Turkiye and Pakistan.\nWelcoming the participants, TIKA Country Director Saliha Tuna expressed heartfelt gratitude to those who attended. “We are here today, alongside our Pakistani brothers and sisters, to honor the sacrifice of 253 martyrs who stood against tyranny and defended democracy,” she said. “This plantation drive reflects the growing roots of our friendship and our shared values.”\nAddressing the gathering, Ambassador Neziroglu described July 15, 2016, as a night of both terror and triumph. “It was a night that began in darkness but ended in the dawn of unity and the unshakable resolve of the Turkish people,” he said. “Citizens from all walks of life took to the streets, not with weapons, but with unwavering belief in democracy.”\nRecalling his own experience during the coup, Dr Neziroglu shared, “I was the Secretary General of the Turkish Parliament, and we were in session when it was bombed. Allah Almighty saved our lives.”\nHe commended Pakistan for its decisive and prompt actions against the Fetullah Terrorist Organization (FETO), describing it as a powerful testament to the enduring Turkiye-Pakistan brotherhood. “Together, we continue to uphold the principles of democracy, freedom, and sovereignty,” he said.\nSpeaking to the media, Saliha Tuna reiterated TIKA’s mission to commemorate the martyrs of July 15 alongside Pakistan. “This event is a reflection of our shared history and solidarity in the face of extremism,” she noted.\nThe ceremony concluded with Ambassador Neziroglu planting a sapling and offering prayers for the continued growth of the deep-rooted friendship between the two nations. “Turkiye-Pakistan friendship is not just diplomatic – it is emotional, historical, and everlasting,” Ambassador Neziroglu remarked as the final sapling took root.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
