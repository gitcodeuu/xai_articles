Communities will be trained to interpret these warnings, evacuate safely and protect their farms and homes before disasters strike.\nAt the same time, the project will strengthen the capacity of local institutions such as disaster management authorities, district governments, and emergency response teams, by equipping them with the tools, training and infrastructure needed to respond swiftly to climate-related emergencies.\nThe workshop was attended by key stakeholders from federal and provincial governments, including the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination (MoCC & EC), the national and provincial disaster management authorities, and relevant planning and development departments.\nSameera Sheikh, Joint Secretary of the MoCC & EC, welcomed the initiative, noting its alignment with national priorities.\n“Pakistan is among the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, and the impacts are becoming more intense each year,” she said, adding “initiatives like this are vital to help vulnerable communities in districts such as Buner and Shangla better prepare for and respond to climate shocks like floods and landslides.”\n“The Government of KP deeply values the strong collaboration and joint governance established through this initiative,” said Dr. Ehtisham Ulhaq, Chief of the International Development Section of the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n“This project not only addresses immediate climate risks but also lays the groundwork for long-term resilience and opens doors to future climate finance for our most vulnerable communities.”\n“Recurring climate shocks are a driver of hunger and malnutrition, threatening lives, livelihoods and entire food systems,” said Coco Ushiyama, WFP Pakistan Representative and Country Director. “This project represents a multi-layered investment – not only in early warning systems and anticipatory action, but also in local adaptation planning and institutional capacity.”\nThe initiative aligns with Pakistan’s national policies and KP’s disaster risk management frameworks. It supports GCF Strategic Plan 2024–2027 by addressing urgent adaptation needs in underserved areas, bridging critical capacity gaps in flood preparedness and reinforcing community resilience.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
