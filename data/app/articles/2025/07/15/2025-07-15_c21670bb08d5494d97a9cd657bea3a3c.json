Upon hearing this, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) member of the Election Commission remarked that the ECP held the authority to disqualify him.\nThe decision followed the approval of two petitions against him, one of which was a reference filed by the National Assembly Speaker seeking his disqualification.\nThe Election Commission has also directed authorities to initiate legal proceedings against Jamshed Dasti.\nIn May, the Election Commission decided to have Jamshed Dasti’s academic credentials authenticated by the Karachi Education Board.\nJamshed Dasti, elected from NA-175 Muzaffargarh in the previous general elections, faced legal proceedings under Articles 62 and 63, as well as Sections 4, 9, and 137 of the Elections Act, 2017. Petitions seeking his disqualification were filed by Ameer Akbar, Zulfiqar Dogar, and Sardar Faizul Hassan.\nMeanwhile, the ECP rejected opposition leader Omar Ayub’s request to drop the assets-related case, and adjourned the hearing until July 29.\nA five-member bench, led by the Chief Election Commissioner, convened to hear the case concerning Omar Ayub’s assets.\nRepresenting the PTI leader and Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly, his lawyer contended that asset and liability details are mandated to be submitted by December 31.\nAccording to the rules, the Election Commission is authorized to initiate a complaint against a Member of the Assembly within 120 days of receiving inaccurate asset declarations. However, in this instance, the Commission issued the notice after April 29 this year.\nOmar Ayub’s counsel contended that the Election Commission’s notice violated procedural rules and urged its withdrawal. However, the Commission dismissed the request.\nElection Commission member Shah Mohammad clarified to Omar Ayub’s legal counsel that the initial notice was issued within the prescribed timeframe and affirmed that the Election Commission had ensured the provision of a fair trial.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
