  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):The United Kingdom has officially introduced digital eVisas for Pakistani students and workers, marking a significant move toward a modernized and streamlined immigration process. Starting from 15 July 2025, most main applicants applying for UK study or work-related visas will no longer require a physical sticker visa in their passports. Instead, they will be issued a digital record of their immigration status, known as an eVisa.\nAn eVisa is an online confirmation of an individual’s permission to enter, stay, or work in the UK. It also outlines any conditions attached to their immigration status. This digital status can be accessed and managed through an online UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) account. The change does not affect an individual’s immigration status or the conditions of their stay but represents a shift in how this information is stored and shared.\nAccording to the British High Commission in Islamabad, the eVisa system aims to make the visa process more secure, efficient, and user-friendly. British High Commissioner Jane Marriott CMG OBE emphasized the convenience of the new system, stating that the transition to eVisas would simplify the process for Pakistani students and professionals. “These changes to the UK visa system will make it much simpler for students and workers to prove their identity and visa status. It also means applicants can hold onto their passports, saving them time,” she said.\nThe rollout applies to a wide range of visa categories. These include students—both for long-term and short-term study up to 11 months—along with individuals applying under the Global Business Mobility routes such as Senior or Specialist Workers, Graduate Trainees, and Secondment Workers. Other eligible categories include Global Talent, International Sportspersons, Skilled Workers (including those in the Health and Care sector), various Temporary Work routes, and applicants under the Youth Mobility Scheme.\neVisa holders will be able to link their travel documents, such as passports, to their UKVI accounts to enable smoother international travel. Through the ‘view and prove’ service, individuals can securely share their immigration status with employers, landlords, or other authorized entities, particularly in England.\nHowever, not all visa applicants will receive an eVisa at this stage. Those applying as dependants or under visa categories not related to work or study—such as general visitor visas—will still be issued a physical sticker visa. Similarly, individuals who already possess valid physical visa stickers do not need to take any action, as their existing documents remain valid.\nThis is part of a phased approach by the UK Home Office to fully digitize its immigration system. The goal is to eventually replace all physical immigration documents with secure, accessible digital records. The transition to eVisas aligns with global trends in immigration management and reflects the UK’s commitment to using technology to improve the customer experience for visa applicants worldwide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
