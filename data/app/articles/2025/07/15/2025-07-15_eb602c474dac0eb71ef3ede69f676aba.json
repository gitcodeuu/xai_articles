  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 15 (APP): Federal Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf on Tuesday urged companies intending to operate as Zaireen Group Organizers (ZGOs) to immediately register with the ministry under the newly approved pilgrim management framework.\nAddressing a press conference here, the minister said the federal cabinet had already approved the new ZGO regulatory system, and in compliance, the ministry had issued a public notice inviting registrations. “So far, over 1,400 companies have submitted applications for registration,” he added.\nOf these, 585 companies that have received security clearance have been instructed to complete their online registration through the ministry’s website and submit all required documents by July 31.\nHe further announced that a second advertisement has also been published seeking fresh applications from new companies interested in becoming ZGOs. These firms have until August 10 to apply.\nResponding to a question, the minister emphasized that the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony is responsible not only for Hajj and Umrah pilgrims, but also for religious visitors (Zaireen) traveling to Iran, Iraq, and Syria.\n“In the past, there was no formal mechanism in place for these Zaireen. The policy for their regulation was approved in 2021, but the previous government made no significant progress,” Yousaf explained.\nHowever, under the special directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, the implementation of the Zaireen Management Policy has now been expedited. “Just as Hajj pilgrims travel through registered Hajj tour operators, Zaireen will also travel exclusively through registered ZGOs,” he maintained.\nEach ZGO will now be required to offer comprehensive travel packages, including logistics, accommodation, and safety measures – mirroring the system used for Hajj tour operators.\nThe minister added that Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi and Religious Affairs Secretary Dr Syed Ata-ur-Rehman are currently visiting Iran to participate in a trilateral meeting with Iran and Iraq on Zaireen management. “We are working towards linking pilgrim travel to a modern computerized system that will ensure better coordination and security,” he said.\nSardar Yousaf disclosed that Pakistan had faced serious issues in the past due to the absence of a centralized Zaireen tracking mechanism. “More than 40,000 Pakistani Zaireen remained in Iran, Iraq, and Syria over the years without returning. If we had maintained proper records, we could have known who went where,” he added.\nHe noted that authorities in Iraq, Iran, and Syria had also formally raised concerns with Pakistan over the issue of undocumented Zaireen.\nThe minister concluded by reaffirming the government’s commitment to ensuring secure, organized and transparent religious travel under the new framework.",
