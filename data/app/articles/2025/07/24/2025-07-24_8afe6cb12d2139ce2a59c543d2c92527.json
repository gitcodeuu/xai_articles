The focus was on promoting responsible family planning, maternal and child health, and socio-economic stability – all grounded in the values of Islam.\nDr. Ali Muhammad Mir, Senior Director of Programs and Research at the Population Council, opened the session by highlighting the dire implications of Pakistan’s rapid population growth. He pointed to high maternal and child mortality rates, rising health complications, and the increasing pressure on essential services and education. “Without addressing this issue, the burden on our future generations will be immense,” he warned.\nCiting data, Population Council’s Director of Communications Ali Mazhar revealed that over 11,000 women die annually in Pakistan due to complications during pregnancy and childbirth. “Pakistan has the highest maternal mortality rate among Islamic countries,” he said, noting that 62 in every 1,000 children dies before their first birthday. Furthermore, 40% of children under five are stunted, 18% suffer from acute malnutrition, and 29% are underweight.\nMazhar urged scholars to use their pulpits and arches to promote natural methods of birth spacing, including the Quranic guidance of two years of breastfeeding. “This isn’t just about numbers; it’s about the health of mothers, survival of newborns, and the nation’s wellbeing,” he emphasized.\nA joint declaration issued at the end of the session called for an Islamic and constitutional approach to balancing family size with available resources. It underscored that protecting life and lineage are core objectives of Shariah, birth spacing – without the use of harmful or un-Islamic methods – is not only religiously permissible in case of health concerns but a parental responsibility and maternal and child health, family stability, and societal welfare are Islamic imperatives.\nThe declaration affirmed scholarly consensus across all sects that temporary family planning measures are religiously acceptable in cases where a mother’s life or health is at risk, or where successive pregnancies cause severe complications.\nDr. Naeemi proposed the formation of a technical committee comprising religious scholars and health experts to guide public messaging rooted in Islamic teachings. He also emphasized the need to expand this consultative process to provincial and district levels and publish awareness content in religious journals.\nProminent participants included Justice (R) Zafar Iqbal Chaudhry, Dr. Abdul Ghafoor Rashid, Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, Justice (R) Altaf Ibrahim Qureshi, Allama Yusuf Awan, Dr. Mufti Intikhab Ahmad, and Sahibzada Saeedul Hassan Shah, among others. Women scholars and civil society representatives such as Saad Muhammad Abbas and Hameer Masihuddin also participated.\nThe session concluded with a united pledge from religious leaders to promote the message of “Tawazun” (Balance) from mosques and media platforms, support national health campaigns, and collaborate closely with the government to educate communities about reproductive health, women’s wellbeing, and child development through an Islamic and socially responsible lens.\n“Let us serve the nation with wisdom, sincerity, and a sense of divine responsibility,” the declaration concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
