  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):The Senate on Thursday unanimously passed a strong resolution condemning the public and illegal execution of a couple in broad daylight in Balochistan, allegedly on the orders of a so-called jirga in the name of “honour.”\nThe resolution, moved by Senator Sherry Rehman on her own behalf and on behalf of Senators Mohammad Abdul Qadir, Jan Muhammad, Mohsin Aziz, Haji Hidayatullah Khan, Kamil Ali Agha, Raja Nasir Abbas, Palwasha Mohammad Zai Khan, Irfan-ul-Haque Siddiqui, Quratulain Marri, and Syed Faisal Ali Subzwari, was adopted by the House during its sitting on July 24.\nThe resolution condemned the heinous and premeditated act as an abhorrent crime and a gross violation of human rights, the Constitution, and the laws of Pakistan. It declared that such barbaric killings must not be justified under cultural or tribal practices and emphasized that the concept of “honour” cannot override constitutional protections.\nIt highlighted that despite existing legal safeguards, the implementation on the ground remains weak, leading to subversion of justice, particularly in cases targeting women.\nThe House resolved that such so-called honour killings constitute murder and must be prosecuted under the relevant laws without compromise. It called upon the government to ensure immediate and transparent investigation into the recent killings and bring all those involved—including those who convened or sanctioned any jirga—to justice without delay.\nThe resolution also urged law enforcement agencies to treat such incidents strictly under the Pakistan Penal Code and called on the Ministry of Law and Justice and Ministry of Human Rights to review enforcement gaps in existing laws.\nFurthermore, it stressed the need to train prosecutors and investigators to handle gender-based and honour-related crimes as serious offenses and urged both federal and provincial governments to launch awareness campaigns rejecting honour-based violence and reaffirming the primacy of constitutional law.\nThe Senate reaffirmed its commitment to upholding the rights, safety, and dignity of all citizens, especially women, as guaranteed by the Constitution of Pakistan, according to the resolution passed by the House./\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
