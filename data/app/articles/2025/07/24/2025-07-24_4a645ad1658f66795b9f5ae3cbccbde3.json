From diplomatic strategies to field case studies, the book is a rich resource for scholars, policymakers, and students of international affairs.\nThe book included a foreword by former Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood, enhancing its academic value. Already, it has been described as a “masterpiece of modern diplomatic thought” in both academic and diplomatic circles.\nProf. Dr M. Iqbal Choudhary, Coordinator General of COMSTECH, lauded Dr. Sirohey’s contribution to diplomacy, praising his service in Africa and his efforts to elevate Pakistan’s international presence. He emphasized the importance of intellectual contributions like this in projecting a positive national narrative.\nCurrently serving as Director General at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Ahmed Ali Sirohey shared personal insights during the event and reflected on the importance of science diplomacy and knowledge-sharing among OIC member states, especially the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) in Africa.\nHe also expressed gratitude to COMSTECH for advancing policy-oriented platforms that encourage innovation and strategic dialogue in diplomacy.\nWith The Currency of Influence, Dr. Ahmed Ali Sirohey provides a compelling blueprint for understanding how influence, narrative, and strategic engagement shape today’s global diplomatic landscape. This work is a timely and essential read for practitioners and students alike.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
