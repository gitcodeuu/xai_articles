Their vehicle stalled near a stormwater drain and was carried away by the powerful current.\nHe said that rescue teams comprising police, Rescue 1122 personnel, and divers launched an immediate search operation. Parts of the vehicle, including its bumper and side mirror, were found downstream, which helped rescue workers identify the likely area of submersion.\nHe said the father’s body was recovered early Thursday morning from the Soan River. However, despite continuous efforts, the daughter has not yet been found, and rescue operations are still underway.\nHe added that the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) Police and emergency services have been placed on high alert amid ongoing monsoon activity.
