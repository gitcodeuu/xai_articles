  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):The Overseas Investors Chamber of Commerce and Industry (OICCI) has released the results of its Annual Security Survey 2025, reflecting feedback from leading foreign investors operating across Pakistan.\nCovering the period from June 2024 to May 2025, the survey reveals a measurable improvement in the overall security environment, particularly in key business hubs of Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.\nAccording to the survey, over 70 per cent of respondents reported a notable decline in serious crimes in Karachi, Lahore, and across Punjab, with street crimes also reducing significantly in Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad.\nAdditionally, employee perceptions of personal safety during daily commutes improved for two-thirds of the respondents, especially in the aforementioned cities.\nCommenting on the findings, Secretary General OICCI M Abdul Aleem said, “The OICCI Security Survey 2025 reflects a cautiously optimistic outlook, with clear gains in major cities like Karachi and Lahore, a positive signal for investor confidence.\nHowever, sustaining and expanding these improvements across all regions is essential to maintain momentum and reassure both local and foreign stakeholders about Pakistan’s overall security trajectory.”\nWhile the number of overseas business visits to Pakistan remained similar to 2024, the decline in meetings held abroad indicates growing confidence in Pakistan’s internal security environment.\nOICCI reiterates its commitment to partnering with government and law enforcement institutions to promote a more secure and enabling business climate throughout Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
