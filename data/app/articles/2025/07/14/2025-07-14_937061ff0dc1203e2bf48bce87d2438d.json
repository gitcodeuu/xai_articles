  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP):The lower court of Islamabad on Monday granted a two-day physical remand of five foreign nationals arrested by the National Cyber Crime Investigation Agency (NCCIA) in connection with an illegal call center operation.\nJudicial Magistrate Abbas Shah approved the remand after NCCIA officials presented the suspects in court.\nDuring the hearing, the prosecutor informed the court that the arrested individuals were allegedly involved in running an unauthorized call center that was being used for online fraud activities.\nThe prosecution argued that the suspects operated as part of a structured network engaged in defrauding people through digital means. The NCCIA requested physical custody of the suspects to further investigate their activities, uncover additional evidence, and identify other individuals involved in the scheme.\nAfter reviewing the arguments, the court granted the investigation agency a two-day remand. The suspects are scheduled to be brought before the court again on July 16.\nEarlier, NCCIA officials had raided the illegal call center, leading to the arrest of the five foreigners. The agency claims that the operation was part of efforts to dismantle organized cybercrime networks operating in the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
