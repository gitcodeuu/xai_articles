Over 74,000 households—equivalent to more than 520,000 people—benefited from the initiative, which combined agricultural support with livestock protection and targeted assistance for female-headed families, said a press release issued here on Monday.\nAt a project closing ceremony held at FAO’s Islamabad office, key stakeholders gathered to mark the milestone and commend the impact of Japan’s timely intervention. Present at the event were Japan’s Ambassador to Pakistan, H.E. Akamatsu Shuichi, FAO Representative in Pakistan Ms. Florence Rolle, and senior officials from national and provincial institutions.\n“The Government of Japan has always prioritized human security in its development cooperation,” said Ambassador Akamatsu Shuichi, adding, “This project reflects our commitment to helping the people of Pakistan recover from the devastating floods and rebuild their lives through practical, sustainable support.”\nFAO’s response involved the distribution of seeds, fertilizers, and training to help families restart food production. More than 14,000 farming families received inputs to resume crop cultivation across 1,500 hectares of land, enabling the production of staple and nutritious crops such as wheat, rice, maize, okra, brinjal, and tomatoes.\nSupport to livestock-owning families included the distribution of animal feed, mineral blocks, poultry, and small ruminants, along with the construction of animal shelters and a mass vaccination campaign that reached more than 629,000 animals, benefiting 35,000 households. Special focus was given to female-headed households, who received livestock and poultry packages along with training in animal care and poultry production to help diversify and stabilize their incomes.\n“This project made a real difference in the lives of rural communities that lost nearly everything to the floods,” said Ms. Florence Rolle, FAO Representative in Pakistan. “With Japan’s timely support, families not only regained their ability to produce food but also strengthened their resilience against future shocks.”\nImplemented in close coordination with the Ministry of National Food Security and Research, disaster management authorities, and non-governmental partners, the project also helped enhance local knowledge of climate-smart practices, food security planning, and livestock management—laying the foundation for more resilient rural systems in the future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
