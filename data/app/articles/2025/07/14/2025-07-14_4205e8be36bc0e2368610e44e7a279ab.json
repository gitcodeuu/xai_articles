  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP):The Excise Department has set up a checkpoint at Bhara Kahu Bypass under the supervision of the Assistant Commissioner Secretariat, to inspect vehicles for violations related to window tinting and non-standard number plates.\nDuring the operation, several vehicles were stopped and inspected.\nThe inspection teams identified multiple vehicles using dark tinted windows that obscure visibility from the outside, a violation of local traffic and security regulations. Additionally, a number of cars were found displaying number plates that did not match the official format issued by the authorities.\nAfter inspection, fines were imposed on drivers in violation of these rules. The total amount of fines collected during the operation reached Rs 279,000. The purpose of the campaign was to ensure compliance with vehicle display standards and discourage the unauthorized modification of cars that could pose security risks or hinder law enforcement efforts.\nThe Assistant Commissioner Secretariat supervised the entire operation and emphasized the importance of enforcing these regulations to maintain public order and security. Officials stated that such violations not only breach traffic laws but can also complicate investigations when vehicles involved in criminal activities use non-standard number plates or conceal identity through darkened windows.\nAuthorities have announced that similar operations will continue across other areas of Islamabad to prevent the use of illegally modified vehicles. The Excise Department has urged citizens to ensure their vehicles comply with the prescribed standards for window visibility and officially issued number plates to avoid legal action.\nThe campaign reflects a broader effort by the administration to enhance road safety, improve law enforcement monitoring, and curb the misuse of vehicles in sensitive areas.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
