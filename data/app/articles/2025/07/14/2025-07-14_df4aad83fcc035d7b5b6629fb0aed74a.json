The four suspects — Rana Saleem, Muhammad Asif, Zaheer Ahmed, and Muhammad Sajid — were produced before the court after completing their initial three-day physical remand.\nDuring the proceedings, the police requested additional time to further investigate the suspects. The court accepted the request and handed the accused back to the police for one more day of physical remand.\nThe suspects were arrested in connection with the death of Noman Khan, who reportedly died while in police custody at Tarnol police station. A case against the accused has been registered under murder and other relevant charges at the same station.\nThe investigation into the incident remains ongoing, with the authorities seeking further evidence to establish the circumstances surrounding the death in custody.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
