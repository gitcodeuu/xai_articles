  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP):The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Monday reserved its verdict regarding the allocation of reserved seats in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly after concluding the hearing.\nThe case was reviewed by a five-member bench led by Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Sikandar Sultan Raja.\nDuring the proceedings, legal representatives from major political parties—including Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F), Awami National Party (ANP), and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P)—presented their arguments before the bench.\nDuring the hearing, the PML-N’s legal counsel urged the Election Commission to allocate nine reserved seats to the party—matching the count given to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F).\nIn response, the JUI-F lawyer contested the claim, arguing that the independent lawmaker who joined PML-N did so after the official deadline and should not be included in the seat tally.\nMeanwhile, legal representatives from the Awami National Party (ANP) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) emphasized that seat distribution should reflect the results of the general elections.\nJamiat Ulema-e-Islam’s counsel, Kamran Murtaza, raised a key question during the proceedings—whether the case concerning the allocation of reserved seats applies solely to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or could have nationwide implications.\nMeanwhile, the Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) lawyer highlighted that the High Court’s detailed ruling, following its initial short order, had been released. He noted that the candidate in question, Tariq Awan, was officially notified on February 22. In line with legal requirements, a party membership certificate must be submitted within three days—Awan complied within two. The lawyer emphasized that Awan’s vote on the minority seat was valid and counted.\nThe legal representative of Pakistan Muslim League-N (PML-N) maintained that both parties were entitled to an equal share of nine reserved seats. Citing relevant legal provisions, the lawyer noted that in situations where seat counts are tied, the law permits a toss to determine final allocation. Accordingly, PML-N formally requested the Election Commission to conduct a toss to resolve the matter on the basis of equality.\nThe lawyer representing Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) contended that the allocation of reserved seats should be directly proportional to the number of general seats secured in the elections. He emphasized that the reserved seats must reflect the actual electoral strength of the party. Additionally, he highlighted that the most crucial aspect of the case is the determination of the cut-off date, which governs eligibility for reserved seat allocation.\nDuring the proceedings, Sindh Member Nisar Durrani raised a query regarding the possibility of reducing reserved seats for a party if its number of general seats dropped following by-elections. Responding to the concern, the lawyer for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Parliamentarians (PTI-P) asserted that reserved seats, once allocated, cannot be revoked.\nHe also voiced objections over what he claimed was a miscount, noting that two of the party’s representatives were erroneously counted as one. Based on the official notifications, he argued, PTI-P is entitled to two reserved seats.\nAfter considering the arguments presented by all parties involved, the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) reserved its judgment on the matter.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
