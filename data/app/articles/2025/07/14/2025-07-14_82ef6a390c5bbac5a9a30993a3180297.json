Both agreed that the upcoming meetings of the Selection Board and Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) must remain top priorities, with a particular emphasis on transparency and fairness, said a press release issued here on Monday.\nThe two dignitaries also discussed IIUI’s ongoing reform measures, including the digitisation of administrative systems, enhanced student engagement, and efforts to strengthen faculty development programs. Both sides reiterated the importance of protecting and promoting IIUI’s unique role as a centre of Islamic learning and contemporary scholarship—rooted in tradition, yet responsive to present-day academic and societal needs.\nIt was agreed that the new leadership must work to ensure transparent, rule-based, and equitable decision-making. The President affirmed his resolve to help build a system that is institutionally strong and not vulnerable to manipulation or hijacking by vested interests.\nProf. Dr. Ahmed Saad Alahmed also expressed his firm commitment to enhancing the university’s research culture, fostering an environment conducive to innovation and scholarly inquiry. He emphasised that immediate attention would also be given to improving campus infrastructure and student facilities, recognising that a well-equipped and supportive physical environment is essential to the academic experience.\nBoth the President and the Rector also agreed on the need to improve the university’s financial sustainability. They discussed the importance of generating new streams of revenue, encouraging public-private partnerships, and attracting investment to strengthen IIUI’s long-term institutional stability and autonomy.\nChairman HEC appreciated the student-oriented approach of the IIUI President, noting that he had worked sincerely from day one to reduce the gap between students and the administration. He observed that such a proactive and reform-driven leadership style would contribute meaningfully not only to IIUI’s academic resurgence but also to further strengthening Pakistan-Saudi educational relations.\nHe reaffirmed HEC’s full support for the university’s academic and structural reforms, particularly in areas such as quality assurance, curriculum development, and merit-based faculty promotions.\nIt was also agreed that the dialogue between IIUI and HEC would continue in the weeks ahead to align the university’s institutional reforms with broader national higher education goals.\nDr. Ahmed Saad Alahmed thanked the Chairman for his continued guidance and support, reiterating his commitment to quality education, institutional transparency, and fostering a campus environment that truly serves students’ academic and personal growth.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
