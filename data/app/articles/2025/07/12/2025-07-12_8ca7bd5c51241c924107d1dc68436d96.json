  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 12 (APP):In an exclusive interview, Director General (DG) of the Ministry of Human Rights (MoHR), Abdul Sattar here on Saturday, outlined recent developments and ongoing challenges in the Ministry’s efforts to uphold child rights and human rights commitments at both national and international levels.\nSpeaking on institutional frameworks, Abdul Sattar highlighted the critical role of the National Commission on the Rights of the Child (NCRC) and the National Commission on the Status of Women (NCSW) in protecting vulnerable children, especially girls. “These girls are not enjoying their rights the way they should. That’s where our national commissions play a vital role,” he said.\nHe drew attention to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2016, and the newly introduced Early Child Marriage Restraining Act, which sets the legal age for marriage at 18. “The new legislation strengthens protections, but the real challenge is implementation, especially in remote areas,” Sattar noted.\nAddressing these implementation gaps, he explained that the 18th Constitutional Amendment had devolved human rights responsibilities to the provincial and district levels. “Now, human rights are a provincial subject. Each district, especially in Balochistan and Sindh, has its own department or social welfare setup. Our role at the federal level is now focused on policy, coordination, and international reporting,” he stated.\nSattar also elaborated on Pakistan’s international obligations: “We’ve ratified seven out of nine core human rights conventions and regularly submit reports under these frameworks. We’re also responsible for defending Pakistan’s human rights record in international forums.”\nAbout the query of help line ,the DG said that the Ministry’s 1099 Helpline has become a central mechanism for addressing complaints related to child abuse, early marriages, and other violations. “Complaints are received, digitally registered in our IT system, and followed up with relevant departments across the country,” said the DG.\nOn child labor and begging, particularly involving Afghan refugee children, Sattar stressed the need for coordinated action. “We play an advisory role, but law enforcement and local governments are the primary implementers. In Islamabad, the Chief Commissioner’s Office and Police are actively working to address child labor,” he shared.\nHe also emphasized the work being done under Pakistan’s GSP+ trade status, which is linked to the country’s human rights performance. “Our compliance with international treaties and conventions is directly tied to our trade incentives. Human rights protections are not just moral obligations—they are also economic imperatives.”\nIn addition to legislative reforms and human rights monitoring, DG Abdul Sattar emphasized the rising importance of cybersecurity, particularly in safeguarding children from online threats such as exploitation, cyberbullying, and harassment.\n“With increased internet usage, children are more vulnerable than ever to online abuse. It is crucial that parents and guardians closely monitor their children’s digital activity, including social media, gaming platforms, and chat applications,” he warned.\nTo address these concerns, the Ministry of Human Rights, in coordination with other relevant bodies, has taken proactive steps. “A special Cyber Wing has been established to respond to cases of online abuse, cyber harassment, and exploitation of children,” Abdul Sattar confirmed. “This wing works in coordination with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and other law enforcement institutions to ensure rapid action and digital protection”,he added.\nThe Cyber Wing not only investigates cybercrime cases but also plays an educational role. “We are raising awareness about digital literacy and safe internet practices through schools, public campaigns, and community outreach,” he added. “It’s not just about punishing offenders — it’s about preventing cybercrime before it happens,further he added.\nHe urged families to remain vigilant. “Children today have access to technology, but not always the judgment to use it safely. It is the shared responsibility of parents, teachers, and the government to create a safe digital environment for child.\nThe Ministry is also collaborating with civil society and tech platforms to implement reporting mechanisms and content regulation. “When a child is exposed to harmful content or contacted by suspicious individuals online, we want to ensure there’s a clear and safe way to report and resolve the issue immediately.”\nAs Pakistan continues to develop its digital infrastructure, Sattar stressed that cybersecurity must remain a national priority. “Digital rights are human rights. Just as we protect children in schools and homes, we must also protect them in the digital world.”\nIn closing, Abdul Sattar reiterated the Ministry’s commitment: “Laws are in place, institutions are working, and international obligations are being fulfilled. But without stronger local implementation and awareness, our vision for a rights-respecting society will remain incomplete.”\nSattar, urged parents across Pakistan to take a more active role in the upbringing and supervision of their children — both at home and in society. Emphasizing the importance of strong moral and social guidance, he stated.\n“Parents should keep a close eye on their children — not just to protect them from mobile addiction or harmful digital content, but also to ensure they don’t fall into bad company. Good training at home is the first line of defense. Children are the future of Pakistan, and it is our duty to raise them with care, discipline, and values.”\nHe stressed that alongside schools and the state, families have a crucial role to play in ensuring a child’s emotional and psychological well-being.\nAbdul Sattar also highlighted the need for community-level vigilance, especially in cases of child abduction or missing persons. He encouraged citizens to take swift action if a child goes missing or is suspected of being kidnapped.\n“At the grassroots level, people should immediately contact the emergency helpline 15 to alert the police in case of any suspicious activity or abduction. Time is critical in such cases, and quick reporting can save lives.”\nThe Ministry of Human Rights is working to strengthen collaboration between law enforcement agencies and communities to ensure quicker responses and better child protection outcomes. The Ministry also promotes public awareness campaigns on safe parenting, child safety, and reporting mechanisms.\n“Protecting children is a shared responsibility. From home to street to school — every space must be made safe for our children,” Abdul Sattar concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
