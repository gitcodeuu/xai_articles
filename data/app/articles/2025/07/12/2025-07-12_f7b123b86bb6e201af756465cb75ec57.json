We invite the world to join us in preserving and celebrating our shared cultural legacy” said Huzaifa Rehman.\nHis speech earned a standing ovation, and Chinese media affectionately referred to him as the “Young & Handsome State Minister of Pakistan.”\nPakistan’s vibrant presence was in stark contrast to India’s absence of a senior delegate, marking a key milestone in cultural diplomacy.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
