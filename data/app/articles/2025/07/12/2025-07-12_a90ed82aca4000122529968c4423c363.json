The candle of freedom that their sacrifice lit in the hearts of the Kashmiri nation is still burning brightly today,” he added.\nHe said, “Pakistan pays tribute to the bravery, determination and sacrifices of the Kashmiri people, who have stood firm against Indian rule for decades and continue to struggle for their freedom.”\n“India’s illegal occupation of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir has turned it into a military prison where extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, political imprisonment, attempts to change the population ratio and systematic conspiracies to erase the identity of Muslims are ongoing,” he added.\nHe said, “Today, we salute these martyrs and all other Kashmiris who sacrificed their lives for freedom.”\n“Pakistan will continue to provide political, moral and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri brothers until they achieve their right to self-determination in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
