We are determined to close these gaps,” he said.\nThe killing of the black bear, a species already facing significant threats due to habitat loss and illegal hunting, has drawn condemnation from conservation groups and environmental advocates.\nDr Malik reaffirmed the government’s commitment to protecting the country’s endangered wildlife and stressed the need for public cooperation in conservation efforts. “Our wildlife is not just a national treasure — it is part of our identity. Protecting it is a responsibility we all share,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
