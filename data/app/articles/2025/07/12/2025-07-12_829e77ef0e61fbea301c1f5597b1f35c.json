We are upgrading its infrastructure to match international standards while preserving its unique heritage,” he stated.\nAt Melody Food Street, Randhawa directed authorities to accelerate renovation and maintenance work to improve visitor experience and hygiene standards.\n“These projects—whether it’s the Gardenia Hub, Saidpur Village, or Melody Food Street—are part of our broader vision to make Islamabad a clean, green, and vibrant city with top-tier recreational spaces,” Randhawa said, reaffirming CDA’s commitment to sustainable urban development.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
