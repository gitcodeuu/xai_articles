It’s time for collective action to break down barriers and create a society where women and girls can reach their full potential.”\n– Women’s labor force participation in ICT remains low at 22.5%\n– Girls outnumber boys in public schools, but their representation declines in higher education and technical fields\n– Healthcare access, especially mental health and reproductive services, is alarmingly unequal\n– Conviction rates for violence against women remain dismally low\nThis report provides a robust evidence base for policy-making and programming, highlighting systemic failures and areas for improvement. NCSW and UNFPA are committed to working with Ministry of Human Rights, policymakers, stakeholders, and civil society to implement the report’s recommendations and drive meaningful change.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
