In the aftermath of Pakistan’s devastating 2022 floods, more than 2.8 million malaria cases were reported nationwide.\nThese staggering figures underscore the urgent need for innovative strategies, such as G6PD testing and new treatment protocols, to control and eliminate the disease.\nPakistan’s Drug Regulatory Authority (DRAP) officially approved Tafenoquine for use in September 2024, following endorsement by the World Health Organization (WHO).\nThis positions Pakistan among the first countries in the region to adopt the treatment.\nThe dissemination event was attended by key representatives from WHO, UNICEF, The Global Fund, CMU, and other national and international partners.\nStakeholders lauded the project as a model of technical innovation and collaborative leadership.\nDr. Bharath also announced plans to host the National Summit for Malaria Elimination in early 2026 in Islamabad.\nThe summit aims to evaluate progress, share global best practices, and foster partnerships across public, private, and development sectors.\n“This summit will convene our partners to chart a unified path forward,” he said. “Our goal is to build political momentum, catalyze investment, and reinforce accountability from the federal to grassroots level.”\nFurther strengthening institutional coordination, the Directorate of Malaria Control signed a Memorandum of Understanding with DRAP’s Pharmacovigilance Centre in March 2024.\nThe agreement will ensure the continued safety and efficacy of anti-malarial drugs through rigorous regulatory oversight.\nIn a powerful call to action, Dr. Bharath emphasized the moral and national imperative of malaria elimination: “This is not merely a health target, it is a duty to our people. With continued unity, innovation, and determination, we will see a malaria-free Pakistan.”\nHe concluded by commending the leadership of Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar and acknowledging the vital contributions of Dr. Caroline Anita Lynch, Regional Advisor at MMV, along with national and international partners dedicated to the shared goal of eradicating malaria.",
