  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq on Sunday strongly condemned Israel’s continued aggression in Gaza, describing it as a “grave humanitarian disaster” and urging immediate international action to halt the violence and protect innocent civilians.\nReaffirming Pakistan’s unwavering support for the Palestinian people, the Speaker called on global institutions to fulfil their moral and legal responsibilities by working toward peace and safeguarding human rights.\nIn his official statement, Speaker Sadiq expressed deep sorrow over the escalating crisis, stating that “Israeli forces have crossed all limits of cruelty and barbarism.” He revealed that more than 60,000 Palestinians — including a significant number of children, women, and elderly — have been martyred since October 7, 2023.\nHe condemned Israel’s military actions, which have targeted civilians, hospitals, schools, homes, and aid centers, calling the blockade of humanitarian assistance and medical supplies “unacceptable and inhumane.”\nThe Speaker emphasized that unarmed civilians are being fired upon while seeking food and aid, further intensifying the humanitarian emergency.\nHighlighting the worsening situation in Gaza, Speaker Sadiq said the blockade has led to severe shortages of essential goods, placing already vulnerable populations at risk of starvation. He appealed to the international community to intervene urgently to halt the suffering and ensure protection for civilian lives.\nThe Speaker denounced Israeli atrocities, asserting that they defy humanitarian, moral, and international legal standards. He said the Zionist regime’s false narrative and propaganda have been globally exposed, and accused it of fabricating charges against innocent Palestinians to mask its acts of terrorism. He called the conduct of Israeli forces “inhumane and abhorrent.”\nUrging global stakeholders to play a decisive role, Speaker Sadiq called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. He stressed the need for international pressure on Israel to end its occupation and recognize the Palestinian right to self-determination.\nHe reiterated support for the establishment of a viable, independent, and contiguous Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. Reaffirming Pakistan’s consistent position, he noted that the Parliament has passed multiple resolutions in favor of Palestine and pledged continued advocacy for Palestinian rights across regional and global forums.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
