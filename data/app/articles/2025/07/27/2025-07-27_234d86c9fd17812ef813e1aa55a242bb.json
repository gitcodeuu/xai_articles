  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):In a major development ahead of the Arbaeen pilgrimage, the government has announced that Zaireen (pilgrims) will not be allowed to travel to Iraq and Iran by road this year. The decision follows extensive consultations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Balochistan Government, and key security agencies.\nAccording to an official statement from the federal interior minister Mohsin Naqvi, released on X (formerly Twitter), on Sunday, the restriction has been imposed purely in the interest of public safety and national security, amid ongoing regional security challenges and threats along the land routes.\nDespite the road travel ban, the government has ensured that Zaireen will still be able to perform their pilgrimage through air travel. Prime Minister Mian Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif has directed the concerned authorities to arrange the maximum number of flights to accommodate pilgrims in the coming days.\nThis move aims to strike a balance between enabling religious freedom and ensuring the safety of citizens during the sacred journey. Further details regarding flight schedules and registration procedures are expected to be announced soon.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
