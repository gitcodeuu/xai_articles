  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):The alumni of Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) Islamabad,  Pakistan’s top-ranked and internationally recognized higher education institution, have issued an urgent appeal for immediate financial assistance to rescue the university from an escalating budgetary crisis.\nIn a collective statement, QAU alumni called upon the President of Pakistan (in his capacity as Chancellor of QAU), the Prime Minister of Pakistan (as the Controlling Authority of the Higher Education Commission), and the Federal Minister for Federal Education and Professional Training (Pro-Chancellor of QAU) to approve a special bailout package of PKR 5 billion to address the university’s growing financial deficit.\nQAU stands as a national symbol of academic excellence and has produced generations of leaders, scholars, and professionals contributing to Pakistan and the global community. However, the institution is now facing a critical financial crisis that threatens its ability to maintain core academic functions, sustain research productivity, and support student facilities.\n“The financial deficit poses a serious risk to the university’s infrastructure, academic integrity, and future development,” stated a representative of the alumni. “This is a defining moment to reaffirm our commitment to education and safeguard a premier national institution.”\nThe alumni community also expressed strong support and appreciation for the QAU Coordination Council for its ongoing efforts and advocacy in highlighting the gravity of the issue and seeking sustainable solutions.\nAs Pakistan aspires to compete globally in science, innovation, and higher learning, the preservation and strengthening of institutions like QAU must remain a national priority. The time to act is now.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
