Therefore, mutual efforts of scholars, students from agricultural universities and researchers from AARI-like institutions are imperative to resolve key challenges being faced by the farming community. The results of such joint research, if timely transferred to the fields, could also significantly boost farmers’ income and contribute to national economic growth, he added.\nSpeaking in the meeting, Chief Scientist Agriculture Research Punjab Dr. Sajid-ur-Rehman expressed optimism about the growing synergy between UAF and AARI. He said that partnership between UAF and AARI would prove instrumental in introducing new crop varieties and equipping the farmers with knowledge to combat modern agricultural challenges. It would also help in promoting safe use of pesticides and tackling climate change challenges more effectively in addition to ensuring prosperity of the farmers and achieving national food security goals, he added.\nThe meeting also explored possibilities for initiating new joint research projects and enhancing internship programs for university students to strengthen practical knowledge and industry linkages.\nHeads of both institutions vowed to promoting innovation in seed development, safe use of agrochemicals and effective response mechanisms to climate change impacts.\nLater, Chief Scientist Agriculture Research Punjab Dr Sajid-ur-Rehman also presented a commemorative shield to Vice Chancellor UAF Prof Dr Zulfiqar Ali while Chief Scientist Wheat Research Department AARI Dr. Javed Ahmad was also present on the occasion.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
