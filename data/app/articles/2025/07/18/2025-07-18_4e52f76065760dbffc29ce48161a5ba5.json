  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 18 (APP):Minister for Communications Abdul Aleem Khan informed the Senate on Friday that the National Highway Authority (NHA) achieved a historic increase of Rs 50 billion in revenues during the 2024–25 fiscal year, with earnings climbing from Rs 64 billion to Rs 110 billion—a remarkable 100% rise .\nDuring the Question Hour, the minister also updated senators on progress regarding the Lowari Tunnel’s access roads. He stated that the 33.2 km network is split into two phases. The first phase, covering 18.6 km, was completed in 2010 and has been serving traffic since. The second phase, stretching 14.6 km, saw its southern segment finished in December 2020, while progress on the northern section stalled at 61.6% due to a legal battle between contractors.\nHe said rigid pavement was laid on 2.6 km of the 7.3 km stretch before work was halted following a court stay amid contractor disagreements. The contractor has since demobilized.\nAleem Khan explained that after securing government funding, work on the northern access resumed in June 2025. With Rs 480 million approved under RMA funds, construction is now underway and is expected to be wrapped up by December 2025.\nResponding to Senator Fawzia Arshad’s concerns about Chitral’s deteriorating roads, Aleem Khan acknowledged that several scenic tourist regions in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir are hampered by poor road conditions.\nHe said millions of local tourists visit these areas every summer, but damaged roads are undermining both their experience and local revenue generation. He said letters have been sent to provincial Chief Secretaries and the Prime Minister of AJK recommending that these roads be transferred to the NHA. The authority will then oversee their maintenance, redevelopment, and resurfacing.\nTo maintain transparency and accountability, the minister stressed that the NHA’s enhanced revenue base is critical for funding road maintenance, resurfacing, bridge repairs, and new construction,despite lower PSDP allocations.\nOn another matter, he assured lawmakers that any violations in NHA board appointments—especially those defying Supreme Court orders—will be dealt with firmly, including dismissal if necessary.\nAleem Khan invited senators to submit any specific cases for his direct inquiry, pledging to personally follow up on each one.\n“If you bring any case forward, I’m ready to investigate it myself,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
