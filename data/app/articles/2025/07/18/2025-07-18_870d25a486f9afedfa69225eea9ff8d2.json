Children start protesting after some time. Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro said that the children should sit and study. What are they doing? It does not seem right that the police have put handcuffs on them.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer said that will they do this to all the children because of two or four students? Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro asked the university officials, “Are you parents, do parents do this to their children?” Yes, you filed FIRs against the students.\nThe university registrar said that we had to file the FIR under compulsion, the hostel is in a bad condition, he is not fit to live in, in the previous fight they had burnt the hostel.\nThe petitioner lawyer said that the hostel fee challans should be called, the summer fee has been taken.\nThe university lawyer said that they will not suffer any harm in terms of education. The university registrar said that the summer session is for two months, now the time is less.\nJustice Khadim Hussain Soomro asked the university registrar if you do not want to fight, then do not respond.\nThe court reserved the decision on the students’ request.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
