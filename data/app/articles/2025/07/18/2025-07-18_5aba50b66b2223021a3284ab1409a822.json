The rains are believed to have caused water seepage and flooding, placing structural stress on the sacred Hindu site, which is a significant part of Pakistan’s cultural and religious heritage.\nMinister Khichi emphasized the federal government’s commitment to preserving the historic complex, assuring full cooperation for restoration efforts. He described the Katas Raj Temple as a “shared national treasure” and a vital symbol of the country’s multicultural identity. “We will extend all possible support to ensure that this unique heritage is protected and preserved for future generations,” he stated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
