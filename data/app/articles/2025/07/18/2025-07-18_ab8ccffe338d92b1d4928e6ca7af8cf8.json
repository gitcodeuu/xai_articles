  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 18 (APP): Federal Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Sardar Muhammad Yousaf on Friday addressed recent misunderstandings stemming from his earlier remarks about Pakistani pilgrims, clarifying that there was no indication of thousands of Zaireen being missing abroad.\nHe emphasized that his previous comments were misinterpreted and stressed that the issue at hand relates to outdated manual records that have yet to be fully digitized – not to any mass disappearance of pilgrims.\nIn a statement issued to clear the air, the minister said his earlier reference to ‘40,000 Zaireen’ was not meant to imply mass disappearances. “The reality is that older, paper-based records have not yet been fully integrated into our central digital registry,” he explained.\nTo ensure the safety and facilitation of pilgrims, the ministry has introduced a modern online registration and monitoring system, which issues QR code-based e-cards to pilgrims and group organizers.\n“This system will provide immediate access to verified information for both families and the government,” he said, noting that lists of pilgrims will now be shared in real-time with the authorities in Iran, Iraq, and Syria – the primary destinations for Zaireen.\nThe minister urged all tour operators and pilgrims to register their complete details on the official portal by August 31, 2025, to avoid being placed in an “incomplete list.”\n“This step will eliminate confusion and misinformation, allowing us to better serve citizens and maintain full transparency,” he added, calling on the media and civil society to help dispel unfounded speculations.\nReaffirming the government’s commitment, Sardar Yousaf said: “The well-being of Pakistani citizens travelling abroad remains our top priority. Let’s work together to ensure the success of this digital system and demonstrate to the world that Pakistan is responsibly using modern technology for transparent, secure pilgrim management.”",
