  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):The Supreme Court of Pakistan on Thursday rejected the request of former minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain to stay his trials in May 9, cases and ruled that it is the authority of high court.\nThe Chief Justice of Pakistan, during hearing, remarked that thankfully the courts are working.\nThe court asked Fawad Chaudhry to approach the Lahore High Court (LHC) for plea to club his cases.\nA bench of the top court headed by Chief Justice of Pakistan Justice Yahya Afridi heard the case.\nDuring hearing, the Chief Justice said that the decision will be written in presence of all respondents so that rights of anyone wouldn’t be affected.\nThe Chief Justice summoned Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi and Fawad Chaudhry to the chamber.\nThe Chief Justice said that the petitioners are getting exemptions from appearance in courts due to the cases being filed in different districts, and even Fawad Chaudhry has been exempted from appearing in LHC.\nOn this occasion, Special Prosecutor Zulfiqar Naqvi raised the objection that the case was not heard on merits in LHC, but was only declared inadmissible and an objection was raised. He said that the Supreme Court has been approached against this decision of LHC.\nThe Supreme Court ruled that these objections are also to be seen by the LHC, so the case should be heard there.\nThe apex court also rejected the request of Fawad Chaudhry to stay the trial of the cases until the final decision. Chief Justice Yahya Afridi remarked that it is the High Court’s authority to order a stay on the trial.\nFawad Chaudhry complained that his trial continued till midnight, to which the Chief Justice remarked, “Thankfully, the courts are working.”\nChief Justice Yahya Afridi further said that if the Supreme Court gives a decision, it may affect the cases of both the parties, so this matter should be decided in the High Court itself.\nThe CJP remarked that it is your request that all the cases be combined and sent to Faisalabad. I have received the reports of the anti-terrorism courts. Your words yesterday were very shocking. All the courts heard your requests for non-appearance. Now, appearances can be made from any city through video link.\nThe court said that our observations will affect the parties, adding that 100 people are nominated in each case of May 9.\nFawad Chaudhry said that decisions in different cases of the same nature would create uncertainty, to which the Chief Justice said that decisions have already been made regarding the disposal of the cases.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
