Just as we visit Makkah and Madinah freely, we yearn for unimpeded access to the first Qibla,” he said.\nAmbassador Zaid, in response, expressed deep appreciation for Pakistan’s steadfast and selfless support for the Palestinian cause. “The people of Palestine hold Pakistan’s unwavering solidarity in the highest regard,” he said.\nHe added that many graduates from Pakistani universities are now serving in key positions across Palestine, further strengthening the bilateral relationship. The ambassador emphasized that Masjid Al-Aqsa remains under illegal Israeli occupation, but the Palestinian people remain determined to sacrifice their lives, wealth, and families for its freedom.\nAmbassador Zaid also announced that Dr. Mahmoud Al-Habbash, Adviser to the Palestinian President, along with the Imam of Masjid Al-Aqsa, will soon undertake an official visit to Pakistan.\nThe meeting concluded with both sides reaffirming the importance of strong religious, cultural, and political ties, and pledging continued cooperation in support of the Palestinian struggle.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
