China is not just a neighbor but a brother,” said Rehman during his speech. “We aim to work with all member states to make the SCO a robust, forward-looking, and effective platform.”\nRehman’s remarks were met with appreciation from fellow ministers, particularly for their emphasis on regional connectivity, protection of shared cultural heritage, and collaborative tourism promotion. His approach underscored a vision of diplomacy rooted in civilizational harmony, people-to-people ties, and shared values.\nThe minister’s active participation at the Qingdao forum reflected Pakistan’s evolving foreign policy, which places cultural diplomacy and soft power engagement at the heart of its international outreach.\nHis visit also reaffirmed Islamabad’s deepening strategic and cultural ties with Beijing.\n“Pakistan and China are more than just neighbors-we are brothers at heart,” Rehman noted in his concluding remarks. “We envision a region where culture and tourism drive sustainable peace and unity.”\nAs geopolitical tensions reshape the global order, Pakistan’s constructive and inclusive diplomacy stands in sharp contrast-offering the region and the world a cooperative, heritage-rich, and forward-looking vision.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
