  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):Chairman Senate Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani on Thursday said that World Population Day is a strong reminder of the serious challenges caused by rapid population growth, especially for countries like Pakistan.\nIn his message on the occasion, observed globally on July 11, Gilani said the main purpose of the day is to raise awareness about population-related issues and to develop effective national and international strategies to tackle them.\nHe emphasized that unchecked population growth is one of the most urgent problems Pakistan faces today. If not addressed in time, future generations could struggle to access necessities like healthcare, education, food, water, and jobs.\nGilani stressed that without achieving population balance, efforts to reduce poverty, create employment, protect the environment, and ensure sustainable development will remain unsuccessful.\nHe called for a joint and long-term approach to address this issue, involving Parliament, the federal and provincial governments, religious leaders, educational institutions, media, and civil society.\nThe Senate Chairman also reaffirmed Parliament’s commitment to introduce all necessary laws and policies to control population growth, paving the way for a more balanced, prosperous, and developed Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
