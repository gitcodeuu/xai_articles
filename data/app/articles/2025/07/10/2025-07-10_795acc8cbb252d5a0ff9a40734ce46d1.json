  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 10 (APP):Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi has strongly condemned a “malicious and orchestrated campaign” aimed at undermining the top civilian and military leadership of the country.\nIn a statement posted on the social media platform X, Naqvi said the government is fully aware of those behind the disinformation drive targeting President Asif Ali Zardari, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Asim Munir.\n“There has been no discussion—nor does any such idea exist—regarding the President being asked to resign or the COAS seeking to assume the presidency,” Naqvi clarified, firmly dispelling rumors circulating on digital platforms.\nHe highlighted that President Zardari enjoys a “strong and respectful” relationship with the Armed Forces, and reiterated the President’s own remarks: “I know who is spreading these falsehoods, why they are doing so, and who stands to benefit from this propaganda.”\nNaqvi emphasized that the COAS remains committed solely to the strength and stability of Pakistan, asserting that “nothing else” is on his agenda.\nIssuing a stern warning to those propagating the narrative, the Interior Minister stated: “Do whatever you wish in collaboration with hostile foreign agencies. As for us, we will do whatever is necessary to make Pakistan strong again, InshAllah.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
