  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 25 (APP):Civil Socity have  demanded Capital Development Authority (CDA) and Ministry of Human Rights to expand public childcare services, especially in areas with a high concentration of working women such as G-6, G-9, and Blue Area.\nWhile a few state-run daycare facilities do exist — such as the one near Rawal Lake — residents argue they are too few to meet the growing demand. Working mothers, especially those from low and middle-income households, often face difficulty finding reliable, affordable childcare during office hours.\nNusrat Bano, a government employee and mother of two kids islamabad i, said: “There is only one government daycare near my office, and it’s already full. I have to leave my child with a neighbor, which is risky and not always dependable.”\nAs more women join the workforce in Pakistan’s capital, citizens and civil society activists are raising concerns over the lack of adequate government daycare centers in Islamabad.\nAdvocates for women’s rights Aliyea  Hina say the issue is not just about convenience — it’s about enabling economic participation. “Without adequate daycare, many women are forced to choose between a career and their children,” said activist Mehnaz Akbar.\nOfficials from the Ministry of Human Rights acknowledged the problem and said new proposals for expanding daycare access are under review. However, no timelines have been confirmed.\nUntil then, many working mothers in the federal capital continue to juggle responsibilities in a system that has yet to fully support them.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
