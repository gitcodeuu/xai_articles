He highlighted that despite low growth, Pakistan’s macroeconomic indicators have shown signs of improvement, such as declining inflation (below 5%) and a recent upgrade in the country’s S&P credit rating from CCC+ to B-. However, he emphasized the need to transition from mere stabilization to robust growth.\nDr Khurram Ejaz presented a comprehensive overview of the current economic context and proposed strategies to move towards a stable growth path under URAAN Pakistan.\nHe noted that Pakistan’s economy has faced a multitude of external and internal shocks, including post-pandemic disruptions, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the devastating 2022 floods.\nThese factors pushed the country toward fiscal and balance-of-payment crises, culminating in the signing of an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) with the IMF in September 2024.\nThe IMF program emphasized restoring macroeconomic stability through fiscal tightening, monetary policy, and external sector stabilization.\nWhile it succeeded in curbing inflation and modestly reviving growth (estimated at 2.7%), it limited the fiscal space for development spending (PSDP capped at 2.6% of GDP).\nDr Ejaz contrasted this with the ambitious targets of URAAN Pakistan, which envisions 6% GDP growth by 2029 with significantly higher employment generation.\nHe acknowledged a critical financing gap between what is possible under the IMF framework and what URAAN Pakistan aspires to achieve.\nHe proposed five initial strategies to bridge this gap including repositioning Development Finance Institutions (DFIs) to fulfill their core mandate rather than investing in low-risk securities; migrating suitable PSDP projects to Public-Private Partnership (PPP) mode to crowd in private capital;  issuing diaspora, green, and SDG-linked bonds to unlock innovative financing; devolving social sector expenditures to provinces in a phased manner;  reducing losses from State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and monetizing non-strategic public assets like ports under a structured asset recycling program.\nDr Nasir Iqbal recommended establishing village-level economic zones, leveraging idle public infrastructure, and simplifying business registration to boost local entrepreneurship.\nDr Karim Khan emphasized that IMF programs and growth are not inherently contradictory and that sustainable growth must be private sector-led. He urged leveraging CPEC Phase II and capitalizing on productive investment avenues.\nDr Shujaat Farooq added that governance reform and performance-based budgeting are crucial. ize.\nDr Muhammad Zeshan noted the inefficiencies within PSDP allocations and tariff structures that perpetuate rent-seeking and protect low-productivity sectors.\nHe advocated enabling emerging industries such as halal meat exports, seafood, and IT, and preparing for the Fourth Industrial Revolution through digitization, cloud infrastructure, and robotics.\nDr Mehmood Khalid appreciated the absence of tax rhetoric in the presentation but criticized the lack of growth diagnostics and the absence of evidence from existing research.\nDr Hafsa Hina and several young scholars raised concerns about the realism of projected inflation and growth targets, advocating for stronger macroeconomic modeling and prioritization of primary education returns over higher education.\nThe session concluded with remarks from Dr Muhammad Arshad and Naila Dar, who acknowledged the constructive criticisms and reaffirmed the Planning Commission’s willingness to incorporate suggestions into its strategic planning.\nIn his final remarks, Dr Shujaat Farooq reiterated that Pakistan’s growth challenges are less about strategy and more about implementation, coordination, and accountability.\nHe urged integrating line ministries, defining measurable KPIs based on policies and frameworks, and improving budget credibility.\nHe emphasized the importance of including the private sector, reforming public institutions, and preparing the youth with relevant skills to ensure inclusive and resilient growth.\nThe seminar served as a candid and constructive exchange between policymakers and researchers, marking the beginning of a collaborative effort to refine and operationalize URAAN Pakistan.\nParticipants unanimously agreed on the need for realistic planning, productivity-enhancing reforms, provincial coordination, and evidence-based policymaking to navigate Pakistan toward long-term, inclusive growth under fiscal constraints.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
