The new facility is expected to benefit nearly 3.5 million residents of Hyderabad and Jamshoro, two of southern Sindh’s most densely populated districts.\nThe inauguration ceremony was attended by high-profile dignitaries including Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan Shuichi Akamatsu, Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, Provincial Health Minister Dr. Azra Fazal Pechuho, and Naoaki Miyata, Chief Representative of JICA Pakistan Office.\nEquipped with modern departments for obstetrics and pediatrics, as well as labor rooms, neonatal and maternal-fetal ICUs, outpatient consultation rooms, and diagnostic laboratories, the center is fully furnished with essential medical equipment, including ultrasound devices and neonatal incubators.\nAmbassador Akamatsu, while addressing the event, stated, “This facility brings essential medical services closer to home and provides mothers and babies with the timely, quality healthcare they deserve. We hope it will be sustainably and effectively utilized.”\nJICA Chief Naoaki Miyata added, “This project at LUMHS will contribute to reducing maternal and child mortality and ensure greater access to quality healthcare in Sindh.”\nIn her remarks, Dr. Azra Fazal Pechuho acknowledged the acute shortage of specialized maternal and child healthcare facilities across Sindh. She noted that the new center would help reduce the burden on tertiary hospitals in Karachi and Hyderabad, while increasing lifesaving interventions for vulnerable populations in rural and underserved areas.\nThe Government of Japan and JICA have prioritized maternal and child health in their development strategy for Pakistan and reiterated their continued support for initiatives aimed at enhancing public health outcomes.\nThis project marks a milestone in Pakistan-Japan cooperation, reaffirming shared commitments to human development and sustainable healthcare infrastructure.",
