While acknowledging some reservations, she stated that the majority of members viewed the bill as timely and essential. With six votes in favor and two against, the bill was approved by the committee.\nSenators Afnan Ullah Khan, Syed Masroor Ahsan, Ashraf Ali Jatoi, Fawzia Arshad, and Rahat Jamali supported the bill.\nSenators Kamran Murtaza and Falak Naz opposed it, citing cultural sensitivities, while Senator Khalida Ateeb suggested limiting its application to secondary education.\nThe committee was also briefed on the case of Bahauddin Zakariya University (BZU) law students affected by academic transition issues.

Concerns were raised over quality, sugar content, lactose intolerance, and real-time delivery monitoring. Officials reported initial success in pilot districts, but the committee urged a thorough review of its nutritional impact and sustainability, particularly in light of rising childhood health issues.\nAdditional discussion included accessible transport for students with disabilities, designated parking, and improving coordination between federal education institutions.
