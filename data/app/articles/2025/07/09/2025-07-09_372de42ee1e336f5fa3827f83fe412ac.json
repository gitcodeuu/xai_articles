  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):The World Health Organization (WHO) will provide emergency health assistance to 1.3 million vulnerable people across 33 priority districts in anticipation of potential monsoon floods.\nIn this regard Monsoon Contingency Plan 2025 was discussed and prepared. WHO joined hands with the Government of Pakistan and health sector partners.\nDuring a meeting of the Health Sector Coordination Forum, led by the Ministry of Health and co-led by WHO, the Government of Pakistan and partners focused on the review and finalization of the contingency plan to ensure preparedness ahead of potential monsoon-related flooding, which poses significant threats to public health and the delivery of essential health services.\nThe main objectives of this plan are to ensure a coordinated and timely emergency response, maintain uninterrupted delivery of essential health services to populations in high-risk areas, and strengthen disease surveillance, early warning systems, and rapid outbreak response.\nThe 33 priority districts identified in the contingency plan are located in Punjab (10), Sindh (10), Balochistan (9), and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (4).\nPriority populations included pregnant and lactating women, children under five, persons with disabilities, the elderly, internally displaced persons (IDPs), and underserved communities in high-risk or flood-prone areas.\nMain interventions included prepositioning and distribution of emergency health kits and supplies, enhanced surveillance and outbreak detection and response, improved water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) interventions in health facilities, and service delivery through static and mobile facilities, outreach services, and telemedicine, among others.\n“WHO stands with Pakistan and partners to be ready to save lives by supporting rapid response, surveillance and the continuity of essential health services in the event of a natural disaster.”\nIn a context marked by the impacts of climate change, which are exacerbating risks, it is crucial to be ready to protect the health of all, particularly the most vulnerable,” said WHO Representative in Pakistan Dr Dapeng Luo.\nAccording to the Global Climate Risk Index 2021, Pakistan ranks as the 8th most affected country by extreme weather events between 2000 and 2019, experiencing frequent and severe natural disasters, including floods, droughts, heatwaves, and pandemics.\nAmong these, monsoon-induced floods remain the most recurrent and destructive, with catastrophic impacts on human health, infrastructure, and livelihoods.\nThe 2022 floods affected over 33 million people across 116 districts, damaged more than 2,000 health facilities, and placed enormous strain on the public health system.\nIn the context of recurring emergencies, anticipatory and coordinated health planning remains essential to save lives.\nAs of today, the Pakistan Metrological Department (PMD) and the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) have issued a countrywide flood alert due to intense monsoon activity and a warning of widespread heavy rainfall (7-9 July).\nAccording to NDMA, a total of 79 fatalities and 140 injuries have been reported since the onset of the monsoon on 26 June.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
