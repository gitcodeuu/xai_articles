  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday ordered a citizen to take his daughter to Poland for meeting with her mother there in a case regarding the custody dispute of the young girl.\nThe court also sought record on next hearing  regarding the online meeting of the girl with her mother.\nJustice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani heard the case filed by girl’s Polish mother Anna Monica for the extradition of her daughter.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer said that the concerned party is using excuses but is not cooperating, the girl’s mother tried to meet her on WhatsApp or other online sites, the father did not arrange a meeting.\nThe girl’s father’s lawyer, while giving arguments, said that the trial court had dismissed the petitioner’s application for custody of the girl.\nThe court directed that the girl should meet her mother, so arrange a meeting. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani remarked that we want to keep this case balanced.\nThe lawyer said that due to the court order, my client cannot go anywhere, my client’s name is included in the no-fly list. Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani remarked that if the girl stays with her mother for some time, she will adjust something.\nThe court directed the father to take the girl to abroad to meet her mother and the FIA not to stop the girl’s father from going Poland.\nJustice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani remarked that the girl’s father can go anywhere he wants but he cannot deceive the court. One case is going on here and the other is in Poland. Whatever you have to say but she is a mother and you cannot stop her from meeting, I always say that no court can resolve the dispute between husband and wife, children are affected in the family dispute.\nThe further hearing of the case was then adjourned till September.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
