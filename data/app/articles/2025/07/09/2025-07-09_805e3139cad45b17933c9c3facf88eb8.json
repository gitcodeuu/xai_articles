Key sites include the Gandhara Heritage & Citizen Center, Melody Food Street, Lake View Park, and Saidpur Village. The Diplomatic Enclave will also see the introduction of digital parking and LED display infrastructure.\nThe CDA is aligning its development strategy with the federal government’s vision to uplift Islamabad’s image as a vibrant city for both residents and tourists. Projects are being planned not only to stimulate economic activity but also to enhance the city’s livability through sports and recreation.\nDirector Sports and Culture informed the meeting that, under the directives of Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, the Planning Wing has earmarked land for 25 football fields and 25 cricket grounds across Islamabad. Work on these grounds will begin in phases. Additional plans include three futsal grounds, one indoor cricket facility, and five cricket academies.\n“Sports complexes featuring swimming pools, gyms, indoor courts, and family-friendly spaces like coffee shops are also in the pipeline,” said the Director, highlighting the dual focus on athletic development and family recreation.\nChairman Randhawa reiterated the CDA’s commitment to delivering these projects on time. “We are focused on building a modern, beautiful Islamabad that offers world-class tourism, hospitality, and sports infrastructure,” he stated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
