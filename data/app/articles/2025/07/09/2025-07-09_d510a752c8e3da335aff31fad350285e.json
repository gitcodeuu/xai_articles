  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Dr. Musadik Malik has ordered a thorough inquiry into the illegal hunting of a deer in the Margalla Hills National Park, calling the act a serious violation of wildlife protection laws.\nThe Ministry confirmed APP on Wednesday that a First Information Report (FIR) has been lodged, and that the investigation is proceeding in accordance with legal protocols. The individuals accused in the case have applied for pre-arrest bail — a constitutional right — while authorities continue to gather evidence.\n“This Ministry is fully committed to a transparent and impartial investigation,” said Dr. Malik. “All those found responsible for harming wildlife and violating conservation laws will be held accountable under the law.”\nThe incident has sparked concern among environmentalists and wildlife advocates, given the ecological importance of Margalla Hills National Park — a protected area known for its rich biodiversity and critical role in Islamabad’s natural heritage.\nDr. Malik reaffirmed the government’s firm stance on enforcing wildlife protection measures, adding that the Ministry will not tolerate cruelty against animals or breaches of conservation regulations. “The protection of our wildlife and ecosystems is not just a legal obligation, but a moral one,” he stated.\nThe Ministry emphasized that such acts of illegal hunting undermine years of efforts aimed at preserving endangered species and protecting ecological balance.\nMargalla Hills National Park, part of the Himalayan foothills, is home to several protected animal species, including leopards, barking deer, and a wide variety of birds. Poaching and unauthorized hunting have long been challenges in the area, prompting calls for more stringent surveillance and enforcement.\nThe Ministry has urged the public to report any suspicious activities within protected zones and reiterated its resolve to safeguard Pakistan’s natural heritage for future generations.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
