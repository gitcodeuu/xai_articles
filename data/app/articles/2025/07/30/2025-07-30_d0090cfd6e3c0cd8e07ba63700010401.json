  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP):In a bold leap forward for its national space program, the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) will launch a new Remote Sensing Satellite on July 31, 2025, from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in China.\nAccording to the SUPARCO, this high-performance satellite marks a new chapter in Pakistan’s space ambitions.\nDesigned to significantly boost earth observation capabilities, it will support a wide array of applications including precision agriculture, land use management, environmental monitoring, urban planning, and disaster mitigation.\nThe satellite’s advanced sensors will enable real-time tracking of floods, landslides, glacier melt, earthquakes, and deforestation. It will also aid national infrastructure projects, particularly under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), by identifying geohazard risks, mapping transportation routes, and guiding sustainable development strategies.\nWith its integration into Pakistan’s expanding space fleet, which includes PRSS-1 launched in 2018 and the fully indigenous EO-1 launched in January 2025, this mission reinforces SUPARCO’s commitment to scientific innovation and aligns with the long-term vision outlined in the National Space Policy and Vision 2047.\nThis mission also reflects the growing maturity of Pakistan’s space program over the past decade. The journey was reignited in 2011 with the launch of PakSat-1R, a communications satellite developed through close collaboration with China. It was followed by PakTES-1A and PRSS-1 in 2018, which laid the foundation for Earth observation and remote sensing capabilities.\nIn 2024, PakSat-MM1 brought high-speed internet to underserved regions across the country, bridging the digital divide and enhancing national connectivity. That same year, iCube Qamar — a CubeSat developed by students at the Institute of Space Technology — captured breathtaking images of the Moon’s surface, showcasing the brilliance of young Pakistani scientists on the global stage.\nIn January 2025, Pakistan marked another historic milestone with the launch of Electro-Optical Satellite EO-1, the country’s first fully indigenous satellite. Designed and developed entirely by Pakistani engineers, EO-1 supports key sectors such as agriculture, environmental analysis, and disaster management, while also reflecting Pakistan’s growing technological self-reliance.\nAs the nation looks ahead to the July 31 launch, it takes another confident step toward scientific excellence and space leadership. From vision to achievement, Pakistan’s journey into space continues to gain momentum — powered by innovation, driven by national goals, and guided by the brilliance of its people.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
