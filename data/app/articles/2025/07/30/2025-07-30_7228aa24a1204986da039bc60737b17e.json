Between 2020 and 2023, over 200,000 victims were detected globally – just the visible portion of a much larger crises. Each year, traffickers are exploiting more victims, over longer distances, with greater violence and for greater financial gain. The real number of unreported cases is significantly high.  Orgnaised criminal networks are using migration routes, legal loopholes, global supply chains, and online platforms to carry out trafficking for forced labour, sexual exploitation, and coercion into criminal activities. As criminal tactics become more sophisticated, justice system must also respond with equal determination.\nThis high-level event, was jointly hosted by the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), International Labour Organization (ILO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), Sustainable Social Development Organization (SSDO), International Centre for Migration Policy Development (ICMPD), and the International Returns & Reintegration Assistance (IRARA)—with kind financial support from international partners including Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, European Union, the US Embassy, British High Commission, the Government of Australia – Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and Norway.\nSyed Arslan, Officer-in-Charge of UNODC Pakistan, delivered the welcome remarks, emphasizing the need to address human trafficking as a form of organized crime. He highlighted the critical role of law enforcement and justice systems in dismantling trafficking networks and ensuring victim support, reaffirming UNODC’s continued partnership with the Government of Pakistan.\nDelivering the opening remarks, Mr. Asim Ayub, Joint Secretary at the Ministry of Interior and Narcotics Control, representing the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), stressed the importance of collective action. He stated, “Human trafficking knows no borders. Pakistan is firmly committed to international cooperation and stands ready to work with global partners to tackle this shared challenge.”\nMr. Riffat Mukhtar, Director General of the FIA and Chief Guest of the event, commended the collaborative efforts of national institutions and development partners in implementing Pakistan’s National Action Plan on Trafficking in Persons (TIP) and Smuggling of Migrants (SOM). He underscored that combating human trafficking remains a key priority for the Government of Pakistan. “Our commitment is reflected in the Prevention of Trafficking in Persons Act—a landmark law enacted in 2018 with support from UNODC,” he noted. “This legislation ensures strict punishment for traffickers and safeguards the dignity of victims, who are no longer treated as offenders for acts committed under coercion.”\nThe event also featured a comprehensive presentation on the implementation of Pakistan’s National Action Plan to Combat Trafficking in Persons and Smuggling of Migrants. The presentation highlighted key achievements, including strengthened institutional coordination, enhanced victim support services, and the establishment of improved data collection and management systems.\nSpeaking on behalf of IOM, Chief of Mission Mio Sato emphasized that human trafficking is a transnational crime rooted in vulnerability and driven by exploitation. She underscored the need for a comprehensive, rights-based response that includes justice, prevention, protection, and safe migration pathways. As Coordinator of the upcoming UN Network on Migration, IOM is committed to supporting the Government of Pakistan in advancing the Global Compact for Migration through policy and capacity building.\nGeir Thomas Tonstol, Country Director of the ILO in Pakistan said, “Trafficking in persons is a serious violation of fundamental rights. Addressing it requires coordinated action—stronger enforcement, better protection systems, and decent work opportunities. The ILO remains committed to supporting the Government of Pakistan and our partners in building fair, safe, and inclusive workplaces where exploitation has no place.”\nHe also highlighted Pakistan’s ratification of the ILO Forced Labour Protocol (P029) as a significant step toward eliminating forced labour and trafficking.\nMs Saira Abbas, Project Manager and Officer in Charge ICMPD remarked , “”No single agency or nation can win this fight alone. As we stand at the intersection of human mobility and organized crime, let us pledge to match the innovation of traffickers with greater collaboration”.\nSyed Kausar Abbas, Executive Director of SSDO, emphasized that effective recovery and rehabilitation of trafficking victims require strong coordination among law enforcement, prosecutors, and service providers. He noted that gaps in collaboration often hinder timely support, while a trusted, well-defined referral system is essential for delivering victim-centred, rights-based protection.\nUmad Akhter, Country Director of IRARA, said “Trafficking strips people of their rights, but reintegration gives them back their voice and identity. IRARA continues to work hand in hand with survivors, communities, and institutions to build resilience and prevent future trafficking. Every survivor deserves more than rescue. They deserve hope, support, and a path to rebuild. IRARA reaffirms its dedication to survivor-centred reintegration and collaborative action against trafficking in Pakistan.”\nA dedicated panel discussion titled “Organized Crime and TIP – National and Regional Responses” brought together experts from law enforcement, the legal community, and international organizations. Panelists discussed recent policy developments, challenges in prosecution, the need for effective cross-border cooperation, and the critical importance of grounding all counter-trafficking responses in human rights and centering them on the needs of victims.\nIn his closing remarks, Mr. Shakeel Durrani, Additional Director General (Immigration), FIA, reaffirmed the Government of Pakistan’s strong commitment to combating human trafficking, acknowledging the personal support of the Honourable Prime Minister. He stated, “FIA will continue to strengthen partnerships and welcomes new collaborations to address both internal and cross-border trafficking by enhancing frontline capacity, improving coordination, updating legal frameworks, and raising public awareness.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
