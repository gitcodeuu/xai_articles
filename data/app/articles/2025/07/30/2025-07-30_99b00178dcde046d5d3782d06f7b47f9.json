  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 30 (APP): Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday called for unwavering commitment and unity in tackling the country’s pressing challenges from flood devastation and counterterrorism to power sector reforms and international diplomacy.\nWhile addressing a meeting of the federal cabinet, the prime minister expressed concern over the recent heavy rains and floods in northern Pakistan.\nPM Shehbaz expressed grief over the loss of lives and widespread destruction, particularly in Diamer, Gilgit-Baltistan, and parts of Punjab. “These floods have left many families shattered. Houses were swept away and lives lost. Our response must be swift and compassionate,” he stated. He requested Minister for Religious Affairs, Sardar Yousaf, to lead a Fateha for the victims of the floods and the martyrs in the fight against terrorism.\nThe prime minister paid tribute to the sacrifices made by officers, soldiers, and civilians in the war against terror, especially in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. “Their sacrifices will not be forgotten. Peace and stability come at a heavy cost, and our nation stands indebted,” he said.\nPM Shehbaz directed the cabinet’s attention to major achievements in the power sector. He lauded Minister for Power Sardar Owais Leghari, Secretary Dr. Fakhre Alam, and their teams for their “revolutionary steps” and disciplined efforts. Special praise was extended to the Privatization Commission Chairman Muhammad Ali, the taskforce, and notably the Pakistan Army’s leadership for their successful negotiations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), which he said had saved “billions of rupees for the national exchequer.”\n“The performance of our officers and taskforces sets a new benchmark. We dismissed non-performing distribution companies, saved the public purse, and restored public confidence. This is the kind of dedication every ministry must emulate,” he said.\nPM Shehbaz recounted his visit to the Lahore Railway Station, which he last visited in 1993. He commended Federal Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi and his team for modernizing the station. “It’s now a facility worthy of the people, air-conditioned, organized, and dignified. This model should be replicated nationwide,” he added.\nAddressing international developments, PM Shehbaz hailed Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar’s recent diplomatic engagements in the U.S., particularly his participation in the US-France Conference on Gaza at the United Nations. “Pakistan raised a clear voice for Gaza at a time when silence was not an option. The suffering of the children of Gaza is unbearable. No one with a conscience can turn away,” said the prime minister.\nHe revealed that he had directed the Chairman of NDMA to dispatch two special aid consignments to Gaza via Egypt and Jordan, underlining Pakistan’s unwavering humanitarian commitment.\nLooking ahead to the UN General Assembly in September, PM Shehbaz vowed that Pakistan would join the international community in calling for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza. “We are united as a nation on this. Our stance is clear, principled, and unwavering.”\nPM Shehbaz urged the cabinet to maintain focus on performance. “Each of you holds my respect, but this is not about positions, it’s about results. Nothing succeeds like success, and that’s what Pakistan deserves.”",
