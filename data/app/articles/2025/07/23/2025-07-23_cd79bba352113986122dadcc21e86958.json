  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):Environmental expert Zainab Naeem on Wednesday said that the recent wave of heavy rains and cloudbursts across Pakistan reflects the growing impact of climate change, compounded by urban planning challenges and environmental degradation.\nTalking to a private news channel, she said that although the government is increasingly recognizing these issues and taking steps in the right direction, there is still more room for collective efforts.\nShe emphasized that while monsoon rains are part of the region’s climate pattern, the current intensity and frequency of cloudbursts are not routine.\nShe highlighted the government’s efforts to initiate discussions on urban resilience and acknowledged Islamabad as one of the few cities with a formal master plan.\nShe noted that even there, encroachments on green zones and dry riverbeds have caused damage. “When you build on natural waterways, destruction becomes inevitable during heavy rains,” she explained.\nShe stressed the need for involving climate experts in city planning alongside engineers and architects.\nShe said that the government has shown growing awareness about environmental issues, but more practical, on-the-ground implementation is required.\nWhile pointing out that Pakistan contributes less than 1% to global carbon emissions, she said the country still suffers some of the worst consequences of climate change.\nShe called for the protection of forests around cities, reforestation in mountainous areas, and a stronger focus on local-level climate resilience.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
