Based on these assessments, timely arrangements and response strategies are formulated to mitigate the impact of anticipated hazards.\nThe series of National Monsoon Coordination Conferences, convened at NDMA’s National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC), was initiated on the special directives of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif.\nSenior representatives from Provincial and District Disaster Management Authorities (PDMAs/DDMAs), the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD), Rescue and Civil Defence units, Irrigation Departments, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), and various national and international humanitarian organizations participated in the sessions to strengthen preparedness and ensure a coordinated response to monsoon-related risks across the country.\nEach participating entity is encouraged to share its operational status, challenges, resource needs, and coordination issues to build a common operational picture and enhance inter-agency collaboration.\nThe platform allows for identifying strengths and addressing weaknesses in real-time to streamline national response capabilities.\nNDMA reiterated its commitment to ensure round-the-clock coordination, timely dissemination of alerts, and proactive engagement of all stakeholders to minimize disaster risk and safeguard lives and infrastructure during the ongoing monsoon season.
