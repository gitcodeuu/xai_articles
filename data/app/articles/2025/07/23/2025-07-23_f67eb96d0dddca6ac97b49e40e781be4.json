  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP): The Excise and Taxation Department of Islamabad on Wednesday initiated a large-scale enforcement campaign against the use of unauthorized number plates and unpaid vehicle taxes in Islamabad.\nThe operation was conducted across multiple locations in the capital with the objective of ensuring compliance with motor vehicle regulations.\nAccording to excise department officials, five checkpoints were set up under the supervision of the Director of Excise. These checkpoints were operational throughout the day and monitored the movement of vehicles in key areas. The teams deployed at these points inspected documents, number plates, and window tints, targeting violations of motor and excise laws.\nDuring the operation, a total of 143 vehicles were issued challans for various violations. A significant number of these were fined for using non-standard number plates. Authorities said that the use of such plates not only violates regulations but also poses difficulties in identifying vehicles in law enforcement and surveillance systems.\nHeavy fines were imposed on several vehicle owners who were found using number plates that did not comply with the prescribed design issued by the government. These included plates with unapproved fonts, sizes, and colors, as well as personalized or “fancy” numbers that are not officially recognized.\nIn addition to number plate violations, vehicles with tinted windows were also targeted. Several vehicles using black-tinted glasses were impounded on the spot for failing to meet the transparency standards mandated by law. Officials stated that dark-tinted glasses not only breach the law but can also be a security concern.\nAs part of the operation, the Excise Department also focused on token tax recovery. A total of Rs. 954,900 was collected in unpaid token taxes during the operation. Vehicle owners were required to clear their dues on the spot to avoid further legal action.\nThe campaign was conducted in a coordinated manner to cover a wide area of the city and reach a large number of vehicle owners. Teams at each checkpoint worked with technical staff and enforcement officers to verify documents and assess compliance.\nDirector General Irfan Memon has directed the department to intensify these operations in the coming days. In a statement, he emphasized the need to expand the crackdown against vehicles using unauthorized or decorative number plates, which continue to circulate despite previous warnings.\nMemon also said that the department aims to implement a uniform system across all vehicles in Islamabad to ensure consistency and make enforcement more effective. He instructed officials to ensure that violators are not only penalized but also made to replace non-standard plates with government-approved ones.\nOfficials of the Excise Department said this action is part of a broader campaign aimed at improving vehicle data management and enhancing road safety across the capital. They believe that standardizing number plates will help authorities better track vehicles involved in violations or crimes.\nAccording to the Excise Department, awareness drives are also planned alongside enforcement to educate motorists on how to obtain standard number plates and pay their token taxes through proper channels.\nThe department has urged citizens to cooperate with authorities during these operations and to ensure their vehicles meet all legal requirements. Motorists are encouraged to check their token tax status and get their vehicles registered with official number plates to avoid fines or impoundment.\nThe Excise Department has reiterated its commitment to continue the enforcement drive until full compliance is achieved in Islamabad. Officials say this campaign is not only about penalizing violators but also about promoting a culture of accountability and responsible vehicle ownership.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
