  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP): The National Highway Authority (NHA) teams have been actively engaged in relief and restoration work over the past two days, clearing more than 30 critical points in areas of Gilgit-Baltistan affected by recent heavy rains and landslides.\nAccording to an official statement issued by the NHA on Wednesday, field teams have been working continuously, even during night hours where weather conditions permit to reopen blocked routes and restore traffic flow.\n“Thanks to their tireless efforts, the NHA has successfully cleared over 30 locations on the Karakoram Highway, N-15, and the Jaglot–Skardu Road, restoring traffic flow,” it added.\nOn Tuesday, NHA teams successfully reopened several sections of the Karakoram Highway for traffic, including areas near Chilas Bazaar and Chilas Zero Point. The highway at Passu was opened for one-way traffic, as were sections near Tatta Pani and Jalkhad. NHA teams worked through the night to support these efforts.\nThe stretch from Jalipur to Gundalo on the Karakoram Highway was also cleared and reopened for two-way traffic. All affected points between Thalichi and Chilas were successfully cleared, with one-way traffic restored. Near Besal, N-15 was cleared of debris. The Jaglot–Skardu Road was also reopened for two-way traffic.\nOn Wednesday, another landslide at Tatta Pani temporarily blocked the highway, but NHA teams quickly cleared it again. The road from Lushe Bridge to Naran was also cleared and is now open. Chilas Main Bazaar has been restored for public movement.\nThe road between Lothiyan and Lushe Bridge is now fully open, and NHA has begun work at Lushe Bridge to ensure traffic restoration. Materials for temporary access have started arriving, and traffic flow at Lushe Bridge will be restored in the shortest possible time.\nBabusar Bazaar has been cleared and is now accessible. The road from Babusar Top to Chilas is also open for traffic. The Jaglot–Skardu Road, which was cleared yesterday, remains open for two-way traffic. Heavy machinery and manpower have been deployed for clearance operations. These efforts will continue until all affected routes are fully reopened.\nAll activities are being monitored in real time from the control room at NHA Headquarters. Chairman NHA Sheheryar Sultan is personally overseeing the entire operation to ensure swift and effective restoration.\nThese operations will continue until the final obstruction is removed.",
