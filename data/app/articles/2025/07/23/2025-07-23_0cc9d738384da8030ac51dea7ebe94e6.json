One of the key proposals discussed was the establishment of a sister-city relationship between Islamabad and Kigali, the capital of Rwanda.\n“This partnership would foster long-term people-to-people connections, cultural exchange, and collaboration in areas like municipal management and green city solutions,” said Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa, adding that Rwanda’s experience in sustainable urban planning and wildlife conservation could offer valuable insights for Islamabad’s future development.\nThe Rwandan envoy was briefed on CDA’s recent progress, including completed infrastructure projects and ongoing initiatives to transform Islamabad into a modern, eco-friendly, and inclusive capital city.\nRandhawa highlighted plans for developing a safari park in Islamabad, which he described as a conservation-driven recreational facility designed to promote tourism through close animal encounters in a jungle-themed environment.\n“We are working to make Islamabad not only a functional capital but also a top destination for local and international tourists,” Randhawa said.\nHe also emphasized the Authority’s efforts to improve the diplomatic enclave and introduce more green public spaces in the city.\nFatou Harerimana commended the CDA’s achievements and expressed Rwanda’s interest in learning from Pakistan’s urban development model. “We admire the vision and initiatives being implemented under Chairman Randhawa’s leadership. Rwanda looks forward to deeper cooperation in capital city governance, sustainable development, and eco-friendly infrastructure,” she said.\nBoth sides agreed to explore collaborative opportunities in smart city technology, environmental sustainability, tourism, and institutional linkages to exchange technical expertise and best practices.\nThe meeting concluded on a positive note, with a shared commitment to advancing bilateral relations through innovative urban planning and mutual learning.\nAs a gesture of goodwill, Chairman Randhawa presented a commemorative souvenir to the High Commissioner, symbolizing the beginning of a potential long-term partnership between Islamabad and Kigali.",
