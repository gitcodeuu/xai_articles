  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Wednesday rejected the request of an immediate stay order against dissolution of CDA and served notices to respondents on intra court appeal (ICA) against the verdict of single member bench.\nA two-judge bench, comprising Justice Khadim Hussain Soomro and Justice Azam Khan, heard the ICA. The court rejected the plea to immediately suspend the decision to dissolve the CDA, however, the intra-court appeal filed against this decision has been accepted for regular hearing.\nThe court refused to immediately suspend Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani’s decision and issued notices on various petitions related to the decision to dissolve the CDA and its suspension, seeking responses from the parties.\nAccording to the order, the appellant’s lawyer took the position that the single bench granted more relief than the request made in the petition, while the CDA has the legal authority to impose right-of-way tax. The court sought responses from all parties and adjourned the further hearing of the case until a later date.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
