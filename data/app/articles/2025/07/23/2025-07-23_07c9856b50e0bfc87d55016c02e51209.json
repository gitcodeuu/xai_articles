She reaffirmed WFP’s commitment to supporting Pakistan’s national priorities through joint programmes that link food security with education, gender equity, and community resilience.\nThe two sides discussed opportunities to scale up school meal programmes, integrate parenting education into nutrition interventions, and explore targeted initiatives in remote and marginalized communities.\nThe meeting concluded with a mutual resolve to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 4 (Quality Education), through coordinated government-WFP efforts.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
