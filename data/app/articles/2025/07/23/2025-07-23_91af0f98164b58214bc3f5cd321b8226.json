  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP): Capital Development Authority (CDA) Chairman and Chief Commissioner Islamabad, Muhammad Ali Randhawa, announced the rollout of a mandatory M-Tag system for all vehicles entering the city, along with a comprehensive digital parking and cashless transaction system.\nThe decision was taken during a high-level meeting held at CDA Headquarters, on Wednesday, attended by CDA Board members, Director Generals, Islamabad’s Deputy Commissioner, Excise and Taxation Officers, ICT officials, and other senior authorities.\nUnder the new directives, M-Tags—electronic identification tags for vehicles—will be compulsory for all cars entering Islamabad.\nVehicles without M-Tags will not be allowed entry.\nIn addition, a digital parking system will be implemented citywide, starting with commercial and high-traffic areas. Smart parking meters will be installed, with variable pricing based on location congestion—busier areas will see higher charges.\n“Islamabad has already begun transitioning to a digital parking model,” said Chairman Randhawa. “We aim to reduce traffic congestion and save citizens’ time by allowing them to reserve parking spots through mobile apps or online platforms using cashless payment options.”\nAccording to the CDA, the new system will allow residents to book and pay for parking through a mobile application or QR code, replacing the need for manual or cash-based transactions. This move is expected to reduce illegal parking and eliminate the frustration of searching for available spots.\nChairman Randhawa further revealed that the CDA’s One Window Facilitation Center is also going digital. Citizens will soon be able to pay for services like parking fees, utility bills, and property dues through mobile apps, bank cards, or by scanning QR codes.\nAuthorities believe that integrating M-Tags, digital parking, and cashless systems will not only resolve parking woes but also improve the city’s overall security and urban management.\n“We are committed to making Islamabad a safer and smarter city,” Randhawa stated. “This step will not only streamline urban mobility but also enhance surveillance and tracking capabilities for law enforcement.”\nRandhawa directed that daily surveys be conducted to track the inflow and outflow of vehicles in the city, helping further calibrate the digital systems. Implementation of these new technologies is expected to be phased, with public awareness campaigns to help citizens adapt smoothly.",
