  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP): The district administration of Islamabad decided to reopen the dam’s spillways on Wednesday to manage the rising water, as Rawal Dam’s water level crossed the safety threshold following continuous rainfall.\nAccording to the spokesperson of the ICT administration, heavy and uninterrupted rainfall in Islamabad pushed the water level in Rawal Dam to 1,749 feet, slightly above its prescribed limit. After reviewing the situation, the administration decided to reopen the dam’s spillways to control the excess water.\nOfficial sources confirmed that the spillways were opened at 11 a.m. today. The step aims to ensure safe water discharge and prevent any overflow that could impact surrounding areas.\nThe district administration has also directed all relevant departments to implement precautionary measures. Authorities have been instructed to remain alert and follow standard procedures during the water release.\nResidents living in nearby areas have also been advised to stay cautious. The administration urged people in low-lying and adjoining localities to remain informed and take necessary safety steps.\nThere have been several instances in recent days when the spillways were opened due to rising water levels. With forecasts predicting more rain, officials say the situation is being closely monitored.\nAll concerned departments, including the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration, Rescue 1122, and the Water and Sanitation Agency (WASA), remain on high alert. Rescue and emergency teams have been placed on standby to handle any emergency.\nMeanwhile, the public has been asked to avoid unnecessary movement near the spillway and dam areas during the water release operation.\nOfficials reiterated that the measure is a routine response to prevent flooding and ensure the safety of infrastructure and nearby communities.\nContinuous rain in Islamabad over the past few days has led to waterlogging in various parts of the city. Drainage teams have been deployed to clear blocked water channels, and field staff are inspecting low-lying zones.\nAuthorities have urged citizens to report any emergencies via the helplines established by the district administration.\nThe administration stated that it will issue further updates if the situation changes and has appealed for public cooperation during this period.",
