  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 23 (APP): The price control magistrates on Wednesday sealed one shop and arrested five shopkeepers as part of ongoing operation by the Islamabad district administration against retailers charging above the official sugar price.\nAccording to the spokesman of ICT administration, in response to rising complaints about overpriced sugar in markets, the Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration has intensified its action against profiteers.\nActing on the directives of Deputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon, the price control magistrates carried out surprise inspections in various parts of the city.\nSeveral grocery stores were found selling sugar at rates higher than those set by the government. As a result, one shop was sealed, and five shopkeepers were taken into custody for violating official price guidelines.\nDeputy Commissioner Irfan Memon has directed that action must be taken without discrimination against all retailers who fail to comply with the notified sugar rates. He instructed officials to ensure that no store is allowed to overcharge, and strict penalties should be imposed where violations are found.\nThe crackdown aims to ensure price stability and protect citizens from unjustified increases in daily-use commodities. Memon emphasized that any officer found negligent in enforcing the official sugar rate in their assigned area would also face disciplinary action.\n“Strict enforcement is necessary. If sugar is being sold at inflated prices in any locality, the concerned area officer will be held accountable,” he stated during a meeting with monitoring teams.\nThe district administration has also urged the public to support the effort by reporting shops that are charging more than the official rate. “We request citizens to help us identify those selling sugar at inflated prices. Their cooperation is important to keep prices under control,” the DC said.\nTo improve monitoring, the Additional Deputy Commissioner General has been tasked with submitting detailed reports on price compliance across all zones of Islamabad. The goal is to maintain transparency in market operations and address pricing irregularities quickly.\nTeams of price control magistrates will continue inspections in both urban and rural sectors, including busy commercial areas and small neighborhoods. They have been told to check not only sugar prices but also other essential items listed under government-fixed rates.\nDC Memon has also warned shopkeepers against hiding their rate lists or refusing to display them. All retailers are required to clearly show the official price list at a visible spot inside their shops. Any violation will lead to legal action.\nIn a recent public message, the ICT administration reiterated that the government’s notified rate of sugar must be implemented without exception. Authorities said that profiteering during times of inflation adds an extra burden on households and will not be tolerated.\nThe public has been encouraged to report any complaints related to overpricing through official helplines and mobile applications launched by the administration.\nOfficials said that all administrative officers have been instructed to maintain a visible presence in their areas, especially during peak shopping hours, and coordinate with local traders to ensure compliance with the rules.",
