This should inspire us to raise our voices against tyranny, to unite as an Ummah, and to stand in solidarity with the oppressed,” she added.\nShe stressed that if the Muslim Ummah wanted to live with dignity, it must understand the true spirit and philosophy of Karbala, and follow the footsteps of Imam Hussain (RA).\nQudsia Namoos, in her remarks, said that the supreme sacrifice made by Imam Hussain (RA), his family, and companions in the field of Karbala remains a guiding light for all believers.\nTheir unwavering stand for justice continues to inspire generations to uphold truth, courage, and resilience in the face of tyranny.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
