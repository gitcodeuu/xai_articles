  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):UN Women Pakistan, with support from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), launched the first Digital Startup Roundtable in Islamabad, marking a significant step toward empowering young women in Pakistan’s tech sector.\nOrganized under the Digitalization for Women’s Economic Empowerment (D4WEE) project, the roundtable brought together innovators, policy experts, development partners, and young women entrepreneurs to explore how digital skills can fuel inclusive economic growth and gender equality.\n“This is about building a future where women shape the digital economy,” said Jacqui Ketunuti, Deputy Country Representative, UN Women Pakistan. “It’s time to invest in women, mentor them, and amplify their voices—because a digital Pakistan must include everyone.”\nKOICA’s Deputy Country Director, Sodam Baek, emphasized their commitment to inclusive innovation: “Technology can be a powerful equalizer. Through this partnership, we aim to equip young women with the tools to succeed in the digital economy.”\nThe event featured two thematic sessions. The first focused on policy and infrastructure, identifying barriers that restrict women’s digital access—especially in underserved regions. Discussions highlighted the need for stronger digital infrastructure and gender-responsive national policies.\nThe second session addressed mentorship and market access, exploring how to support women-led startups through business development, access to finance, and procurement opportunities. Experts stressed the need to connect women entrepreneurs with local and global markets and to actively include underrepresented voices in the digital ecosystem.\nAdding a national perspective, Sayyed Ahmad Masud of the National Incubation Centre Islamabad stated, “Digital skills are the foundation of progress. Empowering women in this space means advancing the nation.”\nThe Digital Startup Roundtable Series is part of KOICA’s broader D4WEE project, which operates across six cities—Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Mardan, Peshawar, and Swabi. The project targets women aged 18 to 35, providing digital training, mentorship, and opportunities for engagement with the private sector to close the gender gap in Pakistan’s digital economy.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
