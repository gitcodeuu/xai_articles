  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Mushtaq Ahmad Butt, Secretary Information of the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (Azad Kashmir and Pakistan chapter), stated that July 19 marks a historic day in Kashmir’s journey—symbolizing unwavering faith, resolute conviction, and enduring sacrifices made for its accession to Pakistan.\nIn his significant statement on the occasion of July 19—Kashmir’s Accession to Pakistan Day—Mushtaq Ahmad Butt emphasized that the resolution adopted by Kashmiri leadership on July 19, 1947, in Srinagar in favor of accession to Pakistan stands as a golden chapter in Kashmir’s history.\nFor the fulfillment of this sacred resolution, the people of Jammu and Kashmir have been rendering unmatched sacrifices under Indian state oppression, military occupation, and the shadow of bayonets for the last seven decades. Insha’Allah, this struggle will continue till the last breath.\nHe said that Pakistan for us is far beyond any political ideology; it is a matter of spiritual, ideological, and heartfelt attachment. Pakistan is that state which we hold dearer than our lives and possessions. The bond between the Kashmiri nation and Pakistan is not merely geographical or political but is rooted in shared faith, belief, culture, civilization, and the sacrifices of martyrs — an eternal and unbreakable relationship.\nMushtaq Ahmad Butt further stated that the people of Kashmir consider Pakistan their ultimate hope and sole support after Allah Almighty. The Kashmiri nation consistently prays for Pakistan’s stability, progress, and prosperity and wholeheartedly acknowledges that the government of Pakistan, its institutions, and its people have always stood practically with the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle. Pakistan has played a leading role on the international front in exposing India’s false propaganda and deceit.\nHe appreciated the wisdom, patience, and prudence with which the leadership of Pakistan has successfully countered India’s false narrative at the global level and kept the Kashmir issue alive in light of the UN resolutions. The Kashmiri people are deeply grateful for this steadfast support. Owing to Pakistan’s diplomatic, moral, and political backing, the resolve and determination of the Kashmiri people remain unshaken. Insha’Allah, the day is not far when the State of Jammu and Kashmir will break free from Indian occupation and become part of Pakistan.\nHe said that India’s occupying forces and its government can never subjugate the Kashmiri people through oppression, genocide, political and economic terrorism, or demographic conspiracies. The Kashmiri nation prefers martyrdom over slavery, and our valiant leadership and people are writing new chapters of history through their unwavering sacrifices every day. These sacrifices will be written in golden letters in the history of humanity.\nMushtaq Ahmad Butt appealed to the international community, human rights organizations, and global powers of influence to fulfill their legal, moral, and humanitarian responsibilities against the ongoing Indian atrocities in Jammu & Kashmir — the worst human rights violations, demographic engineering, illegal occupation of Kashmiri lands and properties, forced dismissals from jobs, and extrajudicial killings. The world powers must take concrete steps to stop India’s barbarity and ensure that the people of Kashmir are granted their basic right to self-determination.\nIn conclusion, he reaffirmed the unwavering resolve that the Kashmiri nation will never abandon its sacred cause of freedom, self-determination, and accession to Pakistan. This journey of sacrifices will, Insha’Allah, continue until the final destination — complete accession to Pakistan — is achieved.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
