He praised the Asian Development Bank, the World Bank, and other partners for their continued support in building technical capacity, financing infrastructure, and pushing forward critical reforms in Pakistan.\nAcknowledging the conference’s inclusion of young professionals, Gilani said, “Empowering our youth is both a moral duty and a strategic necessity. Their creativity, energy, and adaptability will shape the infrastructure of the future.”\nHe commended the Association of Consulting Engineers Pakistan (ACEP) for organizing a dynamic forum that brought together experts and stakeholders from across the Asia-Pacific and beyond. “The thoughtful design of this conference, the quality of discussions, and diverse participation reflect Pakistan’s rising stature in the global engineering and infrastructure landscape,” he noted.\nHighlighting the vital role of infrastructure in national development, Gilani said roads, bridges, power grids, and water systems are not just physical structures but essential lifelines that connect people, boost trade, and uplift communities.\nHe also praised FIDIC’s efforts in setting international standards of integrity and efficiency in project delivery. Stressing the need for responsible use of public funds, he advocated for the adoption of globally recognised practices in Pakistan’s infrastructure development.\nCalling for a future where infrastructure is both well-constructed and well-governed, the Senate Chairman expressed hope that the ideas exchanged and connections made during the three-day conference would foster ongoing collaboration.\nPresident of ACEP, Wasim Asghar, also addressed the gathering and thanked Chairman Gilani for his remarks. He said the conference provided an important platform for dialogue, knowledge-sharing, and regional cooperation.\nDelegates from various countries participated in the event, contributing to its success as a meaningful forum for professional exchange.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
