Further that the National Dialogue on Gender Gap has been conducted on 26th June, 2025 by NCSW and one of the key recommendations from the dialogue was the establishment of a National Task Force on Gender Data Synchronization.\nThe meeting was attended by members of national assembly including Aqeel Malik, Shahida Rehmani, Khawaja Izhar Ul Hassan, Sher Ali Arbab,  Senator Fawzia Arshad, and Officers of the concerned Ministries/Divisions.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
