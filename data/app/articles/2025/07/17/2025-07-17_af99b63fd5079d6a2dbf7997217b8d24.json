  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Islamabad is witnessing uninterrupted rainfall, pushing the water level in Rawal Dam closer to its maximum limit and the district administration has increased monitoring to manage the situation.\nThe federal capital continues to experience persistent rainfall, which has significantly raised the water level in Rawal Dam. According to a spokesperson, the maximum water capacity of the dam is recorded at 1,752 feet.\nThe spokesperson further informed that the current water level in the dam has reached 1,747 feet. This marks a critical point as the dam approaches its full capacity.\nOfficials from the district administration are actively monitoring the water level. They have intensified surveillance around the dam to ensure timely actions if the water level rises further.\nThe administration is coordinating with the relevant authorities to manage potential overflow risks. They are also keeping an eye on the catchment areas that feed water into the dam, which could lead to further rise in water levels if rainfall continues.\nThe continuous rain in Islamabad has not only affected the dam but also caused water accumulation in several low-lying areas of the city. Sanitation teams remain on alert to address drainage issues and prevent urban flooding.\nAuthorities have urged residents living near streams and nullahs to stay cautious as the water flow in these areas may increase due to ongoing rains.\nThe Meteorological Department has forecast more rain in the coming days, raising concerns about further rise in water levels. The district administration has assured that all necessary measures are being taken to ensure public safety and efficient water management at Rawal Dam.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
