COMSTECH will also integrate top Thai institutions into its Consortium of Excellence to boost academic and research partnerships across the OIC Member States.\nIn a major step towards enhancing Halal science, Prof. Choudhary proposed the creation of a Regional Halal Science Centre in Thailand and the launch of a global Network of Halal Science Centres, to be spearheaded by the office of the Sheikhul Islam. These centers will focus on research, certification, and capacity building in Halal standards.\nMoreover, the two sides agreed on a joint five-year programme to award 100 scholarships and technical training in Halal science for students from the 20 least developed OIC countries in Africa. The initiative will be carried out in collaboration with premier Thai institutions, including the Halal Science Center at Chulalongkorn University and Prince of Songkla University.\nAll collaborative efforts will be formalized through MoUs and coordinated via the Royal Thai Embassy in Islamabad, ensuring smooth execution and diplomatic support.\nThis milestone partnership reflects a shared commitment to empowering Muslim societies through knowledge, innovation, and inclusive development, setting a new benchmark for South-South cooperation in science and education.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
