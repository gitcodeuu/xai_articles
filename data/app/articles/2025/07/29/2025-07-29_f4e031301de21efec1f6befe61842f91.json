  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): The outgoing Ambassador of Denmark to Pakistan Jakob Linulf Tuesday underscored the urgency of climate action, and suggested that countries like Pakistan, which are deeply vulnerable to climate disruptions, need not only international cooperation but also localized strategies for resilience.\nHe was speaking at the signing ceremony of landmark Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Danish Embassy and SDPI here. The agreement marks the formal launch of a high-impact project aimed at integrating climate change into Pakistan’s economic and fiscal planning, said a press release.\nLauding the role of SDPI in leading the climate action of Pakistan and forwarding Denmark’s clean, green vision through Pakistan’s energy transition, the ambassador said that strategic frameworks such as Climate Prosperity Plans (CPPs) can help transform climate challenges into pathways of sustainable growth.\n“By learning from Denmark’s State of Green model, we aim to support Pakistan in creating a robust knowledge platform tailored to its unique needs,” he added.\nPaying tribute to the outgoing envoy, SDPI Executive Director Dr Abid Qaiyum Suleri credited Mr Linulf for being a “dedicated friend of Pakistan” who helped transform Denmark’s climate diplomacy into real, tangible outcomes. “Ambassador Linulf brought Pakistan into Denmark’s climate imagination, not only as a vulnerable country but also as a potential regional partner in clean energy transformation,” Dr Suleri said, and added that the new project will prioritize inclusive and strategic action by integrating voices of youth, women, civil society, academia, and private sector in shaping Pakistan’s climate prosperity narrative.\nMinister of State for National Food Security and Research, Malik Rasheed Ahmed Khan, also praised the outgoing ambassador for his exceptional services. “Denmark’s partnership in energy and climate change has flourished over the past three years. Ambassador Jakob has been a powerful advocate of Pakistan’s clean energy transition, and his leadership was crucial in shaping our early work on carbon markets, climate finance, and renewable energy,” the minister remarked.\nRomina Khurshid Alam, Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, credited Denmark’s technical support for Pakistan’s emerging role as a regional leader in climate action. She reiterated that capacity-building initiatives and technology transfers under this partnership would continue to serve Pakistan well beyond the ambassador’s tenure.\nThe MoU, on “Integrating climate change into economic planning”, seeks to establish long-term cooperation in areas of green growth, climate finance, clean energy, and carbon market development. As part of this collaboration, Denmark and SDPI will support the design of policy roadmaps, training programmes, inclusive dialogues, and a digital platform showcasing successful low-carbon models adaptable to Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
