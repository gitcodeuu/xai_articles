We are thankful to the Scottish Government for their continued support,” he added.\nHe praised the Zewar-e-Taleem Program, which was introduced when Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was the Chief Minister of Punjab. The program provided educational stipends to girls in 16 underprivileged districts of Punjab where female education was previously neglected. “In those districts, the girls’ enrollment rate increased from 16–21% to over 51%,” Rana Mashhood noted. “These girls are now topping board exams. We are proud of them. They are the future of Pakistan.”\nHe also recalled the creation of the Punjab Educational Endowment Fund (PEEF) in 2008, an initiative that has now expanded nationwide as the Pakistan Education Endowment Fund. So far, over 500,000 deserving students across Pakistan have received scholarships based on merit.\nHe shared that the provincial government had earlier launched the ‘Women on Wheels’ programme to empower young women through mobility. “We carried out research in various universities and colleges, and based on that, introduced a program to provide motorbikes and scooties to female students,” he said. “Today, more than 26,000 girls in Punjab are benefiting from this initiative. Women on Wheels is now a powerful tool for the empowerment and independence of young women across the province,” he added.\nRana Mashhood also highlighted the development of Pakistan’s first-ever National Adolescent and Youth Policy. He shared that over 300,000 young people have taken part in the policy consultation process, making it the largest youth-focused survey in the country’s history. “This policy will address the needs of young people between ages 10 and 29 and will be announced very soon,” he said.\nThe Chairman further spoke about the launch of the Digital Youth Hub, a one-stop online platform offering scholarships, training, and employment information under the Prime Minister’s Youth Programme’s 4Es – Education, Engagement, Environment, and Employment.\nSince its launch on March 26, over 500,000 youth have registered and 1.6 million have downloaded the app, with thousands joining daily. “Youth can now access global and local opportunities directly through this platform, without needing to visit any office,” he said, encouraging all young people to register.\nEarlier in the ceremony, the British Council presented the 10-year performance report of the Scotland-Pakistan Scholarship Program. According to the report, 20,000 girls benefited, including 18,000 school-level students, among whom were 3,527 minority students and 93 students with disabilities. At the university level, 2,000 female students received scholarships, including 283 from minority groups and 43 with disabilities.\nRana Mashhood also handed over certificates to several scholarship recipients during the event.\n“We are committed to creating opportunities and providing all possible support to our youth,” said Rana Mashhood, concluding his remarks. “These young girls are full of potential. Their confidence and commitment show that Pakistan’s future is in safe hands.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
