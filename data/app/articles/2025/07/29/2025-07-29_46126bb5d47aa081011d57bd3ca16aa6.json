  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):: Artificial Intelligence is no longer a futuristic concept; it’s already inside Pakistan’s classrooms, helping students with writing, research, language learning, and even math problems. Tools like ChatGPT, Grammarly, and Google Bard are becoming silent study companions. While their benefits are real, the bigger question is now emerging, how can we use AI in education without letting it erase the student’s original thinking and creativity?\nAround the world, countries are grappling with this balance, and many are acting fast. Finland, known for its innovative education system, has already introduced AI literacy at school level, teaching students not just how to use AI, but how to question it. Singapore is experimenting with AI in classrooms, but with strict human oversight and clear limits on passive use, assignments still require personal reflection and creative input. Japan has introduced “AI ethics” as part of digital literacy to ensure students know when using AI becomes misuse.\nIn contrast, Pakistan has entered the AI wave without a policy framework in schools or colleges. Students are experimenting with powerful tools before they’re taught what responsible use even looks like. In the absence of guidance, many are unknowingly becoming passive users, skipping the struggle of learning and losing their edge in critical thinking.\n“I use AI only when I get stuck,” says Zara Batool, a 10th-grade student, when asked by APP about AI use. “It explains topics better than my textbooks”, she remarked.\nAreeba Bibi, a student at Margalla College,talking to APP highlighted the AI’s benefit and said, “AI saves my time during back-to-back hectic assignments.”\nBut for Fatima Khan of the same Institute the tool is a performance booster. “It gives me quick ideas for presentations and helps me stay on track.” Though she couldn’t offer a satisfying answer to how she was compromising on creativity depending on AI?\nThis pattern isn’t unique, but the unchecked reliance is dangerous, especially in a system already struggling to promote questioning and problem-solving. Teachers are also noticing the shift and trying to create a balance.\n“AI is the future. If taught properly from the primary level, it can be as powerful as books or the internet,” says Ms. Safina, an English teacher.\nYet, others like Mr. Arshad, a history teacher, warn, “Students now submit assignments they didn’t write. It’s damaging their originality.”\nMs. Rabia, a science teacher, adds, “The students no longer ask questions in class. They expect AI to answer everything. That worries me.”\nThe challenge for Pakistan is not whether to use AI, the real task is how to use it without weakening human potential.\nAccording to Professor Ramzan, who has extensive experience teaching in Saudi universities and spoke to APP, Pakistan must act swiftly to thoughtfully integrate AI into its education system. He suggests introducing AI literacy in schools by teaching students how AI works, where it helps, and where it harms—making it part of digital studies from middle school onward. He stresses redesigning assessments in schools and universities to reward personal reflection, creativity, and practical application—areas AI can’t easily replicate. To uphold academic integrity, tools like Turnitin’s AI writing detector, already used in the West, should be adopted in Pakistan. Professor Ramzan also advocates a shift in teaching philosophy: evaluating learning processes rather than just outcomes, to foster original thought and critical engagement. Lastly, he emphasizes training educators not only to detect misuse but to guide students in using AI as a thinking partner rather than a substitute.\nWhile private schools in urban centers may have begun experimenting with AI, a vast majority of public institutions still lack the infrastructure, training, and internet access to do the same. This growing digital divide could create a two-tier education system, one where creativity is enhanced by AI, and another where students are left further behind.\nIf Pakistan embraces AI not as a shortcut, but as a springboard for deeper learning, it can shape a future where students are not just consumers of technology but creators with it. The real opportunity lies in teaching the next generation to think critically, imagine boldly, and use AI as a partner in their pursuit of knowledge. With the right vision, AI can help unlock a more creative, curious, and empowered Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
