  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): Pakistan and Ethiopia have agreed to collaborate on green initiatives, focusing on afforestation, sustainability, and youth empowerment.\nThe agreement emerged during a meeting between Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Dr. Musadik Malik and Ethiopian Ambassador Jemal Beker Abdulla in Islamabad on Tuesday.\nDuring the meeting, Ambassador Abdulla presented Ethiopia’s flagship Green Legacy Initiative, a nationwide campaign launched in 2019 to promote environmental stewardship, empower women through sustainable practices, and restore ecosystems through mass tree planting.\nThe ambassador emphasized that despite their limited role in causing climate change, countries like Pakistan are suffering disproportionately from its effects and require urgent support and collaboration to adapt.\n“Global climate action must be inclusive and swift,” said Ambassador Abdulla, adding that Ethiopia is eager to share its experience with Pakistan through technical cooperation and people-centered environmental projects.\nDr. Musadik Malik praised Ethiopia’s green initiatives and expressed keen interest in integrating lessons from the Green Legacy Initiative into Pakistan’s own Green Pakistan Programme.\nThe two sides explored areas of potential cooperation including knowledge sharing, large-scale afforestation drives, and community-based conservation strategies.\n“Our youth can be the driving force behind real, lasting climate action,” said Dr. Malik.\nHe underscored the need to equip young leaders with tools and platforms to innovate in climate solutions.\nHe also highlighted recent steps by the Ministry to promote environmental entrepreneurship, such as supporting five Pakistani green startups to showcase their work at the SDG Fair in Seville, Spain.\nThe Minister also raised concern over the growing food security challenges facing Pakistan, driven by population growth and resource stress.\nHe stressed the importance of climate-smart agriculture, improved water management, and environmentally responsible farming techniques as part of a broader resilience strategy.\nBoth sides reaffirmed their commitment to fostering environmental cooperation, exchanging best practices, and advancing joint efforts to tackle the climate crisis.",
