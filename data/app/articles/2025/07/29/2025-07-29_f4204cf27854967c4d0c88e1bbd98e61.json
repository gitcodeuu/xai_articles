Representing the British Esports Federation were Thomas Dore, Vice President, and Kalam Neale, Head of Education.\nShaza Fatima highlighted Pakistan’s growing talent pool in game development, with youth already publishing games on global platforms such as SEGA and Nintendo.\nShe emphasised that while the government is investing in capacity-building and training, the key challenge lies in commercialisation. “We have immense young talent; commercialisation is the bottleneck. We seek your support to help Pakistani developers reach international markets,” she noted.\nThe minister further outlined a three-pronged strategy to support the esports and gaming industry: coursework and specialised training in game-tech, funding initiatives to drive youth employment, and targeted support for commercialising locally developed games.\nChairman PMYP Rana Mashood echoed these sentiments, terming the initiative a “wonderful opportunity to collaborate on game-tech” and a vital step in tapping into a high-potential industry for Pakistani youth.\nThe meeting concluded with a shared commitment to formulate a forward-looking, inclusive esports policy for Pakistan, anchored in international best practices and aligned with the country’s digital and economic ambitions\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
