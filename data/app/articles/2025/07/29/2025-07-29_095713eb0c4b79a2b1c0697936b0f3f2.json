This is a step towards turning railways into a best-in-class transportation system for both passengers and cargo freight,” PM Shehbaz remarked.\nThe Prime Minister commended Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi, Secretary and Chairman Railways, and the entire team for their efforts, while also acknowledging former minister Khawaja Muhammad Saad Rafique’s “16 months of dedicated service to the railways department.”\nShehbaz Sharif directed the railway authorities to ensure punctuality and transparent outsourcing of railway land and services, making them profitable assets for the nation. He emphasized that the transformation of railways must continue across the country—from Peshawar to Karachi, Rohri, and Quetta—turning it into a reliable network on par with global standards.\nHe further said, “The Almighty guides and supports every sincere effort. This is just the first step; we must struggle with dedication and transparency to serve the people of Pakistan.” The newly launched Pak Business Express will operate between Lahore and Karachi in 18 hours and 30 minutes, with an economy-class fare of Rs 5,100.\nDuring his address, PM Shehbaz also paid tribute to Pakistan’s Armed Forces for their bravery in the recent four-day war with India, which he described as “short but highly dangerous.” He lauded the military’s technical supremacy, the Air Force’s internal innovations, the Army’s use of Al Fatah missiles, and the Navy’s preparedness, crediting teamwork and national unity for the victory. “India believed Pakistan could only rely on nuclear deterrence, but conventional warfare supremacy has shattered that myth,” he said, reaffirming his commitment to the nation’s security and progress.\nPM Shehbaz concluded the ceremony with a pledge to transform Pakistan Railways into a modern, transparent, and people-centric institution. He said, “Together we can make railways a true engine of progress for Pakistan.”Minister for Railways Hanif Abbasi thanked the Prime Minister for his vision and leadership, crediting him for supporting digitization, outsourcing of services, and introducing a cashless payment system at railway stations. He revealed that railways had earned Rs 93 billion, installed escalators for differently-abled passengers, and improved cleanliness and punctuality across stations.\nAbbasi also praised the Prime Minister’s bold stance during the recent conflict with India, saying his “direct calls and strong foreign policy” forced aggressive India into a defensive position while garnering international support for Pakistan.",
