  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP): In a landmark decision, the Federal Ombudsperson for Protection Against Harassment at the Workplace (FOSPAH) has ordered Rs. 1 million in compensation to be paid by Mr. Saif Ullah, a PhD scholar and Assistant Professor at a renowned university in Islamabad. The case was brought forward by the father of a 17-year-old A-Level student, after allegations of inappropriate and persistent behavior by the accused during private home tutoring sessions.\nAccording to the complaint, Mr. Saif Ullah engaged in inappropriate conduct, including suggestive messages and unsolicited attempts to establish a secret friendship with the minor, under the guise of academic instruction. The student’s testimony, corroborated by WhatsApp screenshots and consistent parental affidavits, revealed a disturbing misuse of authority that blurred professional boundaries and violated the trust placed in the educator.\nFollowing a comprehensive inquiry including cross-examinations and review of digital evidence, the Ombudsperson found that the accused, in a clear breach of Section 2(h)(i) of the Protection Against Harassment of Women at the Workplace Act, 2010, had harassed the minor and misused his position of power. The judgment emphasized that students, especially minors, fall under the protection of the Act and are to be safeguarded from such abuses, whether in institutions or auxiliary academic settings like tutoring.\nFOSPAH has also directed the university to constitute a standing inquiry committee; prominently display the Code of Conduct against harassment across its premises; and conduct regular awareness seminars and workshops for students, faculty, and staff.\nThese directives reflect FOSPAH’s zero-tolerance policy toward harassment and its commitment to ensuring safe learning environments for all, including vulnerable students in informal educational settings. FOSPAH remains steadfast in its mission to create safe and equitable work and learning environments across Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
