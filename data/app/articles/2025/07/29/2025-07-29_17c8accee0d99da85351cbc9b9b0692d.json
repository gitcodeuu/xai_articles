  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):: Following the tragic deaths of an MS student, a woman, and a harrowing incident involving a family in a carry van trying to avoid a pedestrian on Park Road near COMSATS University, public pressure has intensified for immediate safety measures. Amid growing student demand and mounting community concern, the Capital Development Authority (CDA) has confirmed that a proposal for the construction of a pedestrian bridge is now officially under consideration.\nWhat was once a standard crossing route for students and residents has now turned into a dangerous stretch of road. Park Road, after its recent expansion, has become a major, high-speed artery linking key areas such as Taramri Chowk, Chak Shahzad, Bani Gala, and Rawal Dam. With educational institutions like COMSATS University on one side and over 70 private hostels and residential colonies on the other, hundreds of pedestrians must cross the road daily, without the aid of a footbridge, traffic signals, or zebra crossings.\nThe situation took a deadly turn recently when two pedestrians, a COMSATS postgraduate student and a local woman, lost their lives while attempting to cross the road. In another devastating incident, two women were crossing the road when a speeding car struck them and overturned. Both the women and the car’s driver sustained severe injuries and were rushed to the hospital, where they later succumbed to their injuries. These back-to-back tragedies have triggered widespread concern and public outcry, particularly among the student community and local residents who rely on this route daily.\n“It feels like you’re risking your life every time you step onto that road,” said Khawar Zaman, a student of Media and Communication at COMSATS talking to APP. “Cars move at dangerously high speeds, and without any pedestrian bridge or crossing system, we’re forced to play a waiting game with traffic. Crossing this road has become a daily struggle, and now, a deadly one.”\nHis concerns are echoed by many other students and hostel residents, who argue that Park Road has become increasingly unsafe due to unchecked traffic flow and the absence of pedestrian safety infrastructure.\nTasmia Gull, a BBA student and a hostel resident, whos has to cross this dangerous road daily stressed the urgency, “Park Road connects several densely populated academic and residential areas, but no planning was done to accommodate pedestrians. There are no traffic lights, no zebra crossings, just speeding vehicles. It’s terrifying, especially for students who walk to and from class. A pedestrian bridge is not just needed, it’s critical.”\nIn response to the growing public demand, the Capital Development Authority has acknowledged that the issue is being taken seriously.\n“The case for installation of pedestrian bridges on Park Road is in process for requisite approvals,” said a deputy director at the CDA requesting anonymity, while speaking to APP. “After clearance of the requisite codal formalities and allocation of funds, installation of pedestrian bridges on Park Road will be taken in hand as early as possible.”\nWhile the CDA’s statement offers some reassurance, students and residents emphasize that action must be swift and not delayed by red tape. Many argue that the lives already lost should serve as a wake-up call for authorities to implement permanent safety solutions.\nThe area around COMSATS University is not only an academic center but a growing residential and commercial zone. Urban planners and civic bodies are being urged to treat pedestrian safety as a priority, particularly in educational hubs where young people form the majority of the population.\nUntil real steps are taken, Park Road remains a danger zone, one that residents cross daily, hoping they won’t be the next victims.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
