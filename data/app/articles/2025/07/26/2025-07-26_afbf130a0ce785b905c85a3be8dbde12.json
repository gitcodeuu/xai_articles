  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 26 (APP):Pakistan has secured a Bronze Medal at the 55th International Physics Olympiad (IPhO), marking yet another significant achievement in the country’s scientific journey.\nThe International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) was held  in France from July 17 to 25.\nDaniyal Shahzad Hamid, a student of The Science School, T Chowk, GT Road, Rawat, Islamabad, clinched the Bronze Medal for Pakistan.\nAdditionally, Muhammad Bilal from Sundar STEM School, Lahore earned an Honorable Mention, while Eiman Fatima from Fazaia Inter College, PAF Base Nur Khan, Rawalpindi received the prestigious Thales Solidarity IPhO Award.\nThe award includes a €5,000 educational grant and a one-year mentorship to encourage inclusion in science and technology.\nThe Pakistani team was sponsored by the STEM Careers Program, a collaborative initiative of the Higher Education Commission (HEC) and the Pakistan Institute of Engineering and Applied Sciences (PIEAS). The team was trained and led by Prof. Dr. Shahid Qamar and Dr. Muhammad Irfan, both from PIEAS.\nPIEAS, under the umbrella of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC), organizes the National Science Talent Contest (NSTC) annually in four disciplines—Physics, Chemistry, Biology, and Mathematics. NSTC evolved from the National Physics Talent Contest (NPTC), launched by PIEAS in 1995 and held regularly since 2003.\nAccordung to a news release, these contests aim to nurture young talent at the intermediate level and prepare them for participation in the International Science Olympiads (ISOs).\nEach year, students from 19 cities across Pakistan are screened and trained at designated institutes. PIEAS trains students in Physics, NIBGE-C in Biology, HEJ Research Institute of Chemistry at the University of Karachi in Chemistry, and COMSATS Lahore in Mathematics. The best 4 to 6 students in each subject represent Pakistan in the ISOs.\nSince Pakistan began participating in the IPhO in 2001, and in other Olympiads subsequently, more than 365 students have represented the country internationally, earning 139 medals. Over 240 training camps have been conducted, benefiting around 4,500 students under the STEM Careers program.\nThis year’s success at the IPhO reinforces Pakistan’s commitment to promoting scientific excellence and empowering its youth through global platforms.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
