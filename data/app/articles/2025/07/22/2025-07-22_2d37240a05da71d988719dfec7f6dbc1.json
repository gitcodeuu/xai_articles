  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 22 (APP):Continuous rainfall has pushed water levels at Rawal Dam to a critical point, prompting the district administration to open the spillways to prevent overflow.\nAccording to the spokesman of ICT administration, the controlled release of water is being closely monitored to ensure public safety.\nHe said that the water level in Rawal Dam reached 1,750 feet on Tuesday following hours of persistent rain in the federal capital and adjoining areas.\nIn response, the district administration ordered the immediate opening of the dam’s spillways to manage the rising water, he added.\nAccording to the district administration, the discharge of water from the dam is expected to continue for five hours. The process is being supervised by the Assistant Commissioner of Nilore, who was present on-site to monitor operations.\nOfficials confirmed that all safety protocols were strictly followed before opening the spillways to ensure the controlled release of water does not pose risks to nearby areas.\nThe administration also deployed rescue teams, ambulance services, and police personnel at various bridges and critical points downstream of the dam to handle any emergency.\nA spokesman stated that the water release will continue until the dam’s level drops to 1,746 feet, which is considered a safer threshold. The decision to open the spillways was made to avoid any potential damage to the dam’s structure and prevent flooding in the surrounding localities.\nThe district administration has urged residents living in the vicinity of streams and low-lying areas to stay alert and follow safety instructions. Continuous monitoring of water levels and weather patterns is underway to determine any further measures.\nThis controlled water discharge is part of standard procedures adopted by the authorities during the monsoon season when the dam reaches near-full capacity due to heavy rains.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
