  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 22 (APP):: The tragic, lonely deaths of Ayesha Khan, a veteran television icon, and Humaira Asghar Ali, a young model and actress, have shaken us, not just because of their fame, but because of what their fates reveal about us as a society.\nBoth women were found lifeless in their Karachi apartments, days ,and in Humaira’s case, possibly months , after their deaths. Their bodies, in advanced states of decomposition, became a heartbreaking metaphor for something deeper, a society in decay, where emotional neglect, isolation, and moral disengagement are becoming all too common.\nIn the wake of these tragic incidents, a chorus of voices from across society, including social activists, educationists, health experts, and media professionals, has called for urgent policy reforms and a renewed focus on moral and social development.\nBushra Iqbal Hussain, CEO of Mahfooz Bachpan, and Rabbiya Arshad, founder of a digital media platform, jointly stressed that societal pressures, stigma around independent women, and the relentless pursuit of superficial ideals are fueling mental health issues and isolation. They warned that a society that fails to respect women’s choices and ignores emotional well-being is heading toward deeper moral and psychological decay.\nTalking to APP, Dr. Samira Azmat an educationist at COMSATS University Islamabad said with the passage of time, a pattern of decline in Joint family system may be observed in Pakistan, however, not necessarily the family life. The changing economic situation, modernization and globalization are some of the major precursors of this change.\nPsy. Sobia Khateeb consultant clinical psychologist and psychosexual family therapist said I’ve observed a growing crisis of emotional isolation masked by social connectedness people live under the same roof yet remain emotionally distant, with empathy, respect, and genuine presence steadily eroding. Many high-functioning individuals silently struggle with anxiety, depression, and identity crises rooted in deep, unrecognized loneliness manifesting as numbness, emptiness, low energy, and disconnection. These are not fleeting moods but signs of declining mental health. Emotional disconnection is the true pandemic, and we must urgently promote mental health awareness, restore emotional intimacy in families, and destigmatize therapy before we lose more of our most vital resource our people.\nEtisam ul Haq Abbasi, a student at COMSATS University Islamabad, in response to APP question, “Don’t you think today’s youth is no longer ready to own the long-cherished family system?” said the youth’s sense of responsibility is debated — some argue that Western ideals promote individualism over tradition, while others see it as a natural shift, empowering young people to challenge norms and seek accountability. He emphasized the need for a balance between personal freedom and social responsibility.\nStakeholders such as family structures, societal institutions, and the community at large appear to have failed in providing the emotional and moral support that women in such circumstances often need. Experts believe that these recent tragedies highlight a growing moral and social decline, where traditional support systems for women are steadily eroding due to rapid urbanization, shifting gender roles, and increasing individualism.\nIn the wake of these heartbreaking tragedies, society’s thought leaders, from mental health professionals to social activists, are urging a collective awakening. They call for immediate policy reforms and a revival of our fading moral fabric. The failure of families, institutions, and communities to protect the vulnerable reflects a deeper social decay. To reverse this decline, they demand not just structural safeguards like welfare checks and renter protections, but a cultural shift one that rebuilds empathy, revives civic duty, and reclaims the human connections that once formed the backbone of our family system. Without this, they warn, we risk becoming a society too fractured to care, and too late to change.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
