He also noted Bokhari’s strong association with radio broadcasting.\nSenator Siddiqui praised the event, saying it was a beautiful and meaningful gathering, and emphasized that such events should continue to be organized. A large number of people attended the program, reflecting its success.\nHe congratulated and commended Dr Najeeba Arif, Chairperson of PAL, for organizing the successful event and expressed hope that more such programs would be held in the future.\nHe underscored that these events carry great significance for the youth, who need exposure to refined, thoughtful, and intellectually stimulating gatherings. He described the event as graceful, dignified, and engaging — a lesson in itself for the younger generation. Patras Bokhari’s life, he said, was a powerful example of how one can achieve excellence across multiple fields.\nSenator Siddiqui noted, “Such institutions are the soul, spirit, and identity of a nation — recognized and valued around the world. Literary institutions are cherished and protected globally.”\nHe expressed hope that these institutions will not only continue to exist but will flourish and grow in importance over time.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
