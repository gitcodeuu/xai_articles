  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry has reiterated his dedication for developing Gwadar into a modern, integrated maritime and logistics center that supports national priorities and promotes the socio-economic development of the region.\nThe minister shared his vision during a meeting with Gwadar Port Authority Chairman Noor ul Haque, who briefed him on the port’s performance, ongoing development projects, and future business plans during the his official visit to Gwadar, said a press release.\nHe highlighted the importance of taking concrete steps for enhancing ports’ performance that reflect on-ground realities focusing on prosperity, inclusivity, and national pride.\nDiscussing the untapped economic potential of Balochistan’s coastal and agricultural regions, the minister pointed out business opportunities in fishing and date production in Gwadar, Panjgur, and Kech districts.\nIt was disclosed in the meeting that the Makran coast contributes 40% of Pakistan’s fish catch, while Kech and Panjgur produce over half of the country’s high-quality dates. However, a 30–40% post-harvest loss occurs due to the lack of value-addition facilities, which negatively impacts export potential.\nJunaid urged both private and public sectors to invest in processing plants for fish cleaning, freezing, and packaging, as well as for date grading, drying, and production of syrups and jams. He also emphasized the urgent requirement for cold storage and logistics infrastructure to support sustainable exports.\nFurther, the meeting included plans for establishing an Off-Dock Terminal near the New Gwadar International Airport. One hundred acres have been allocated for this terminal, which will serve as a key hub for container and cargo handling.\nThis terminal is expected to provide vital logistical benefits, especially for landlocked Central Asian countries such as Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan, by reducing their logistical costs.\nWith a projected cost of PKR 497 million and a completion timeline of one year, the Off-Dock Terminal will reduce demurrage charges, enhance trade confidence, and increase revenue generation through Gwadar Port, Gwadar Port Chairman informed the Minister.\nJunaid also visited the China Business Center, where he was briefed on the Gwadar Port, Free Zone, Gwadar International Terminal, and related infrastructure projects. Pleased with the progress, he instructed relevant authorities to expedite efforts and make necessary improvements to maintain momentum.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
