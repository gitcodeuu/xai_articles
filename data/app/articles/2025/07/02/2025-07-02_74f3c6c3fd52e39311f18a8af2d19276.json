Senior jurist, author, researcher, and poet Sajid Hussain Malik delivered the keynote address. He focused on the practical aspects of the Tragedy of Karbala.\nThe distinguished speaker began by briefly narrating the incident of Karbala, highlighting the virtues of the Ahl-e-Bait (the family of the Prophet), reciting praises for Imam Hussain, and discussing the importance and greatness of martyrdom.\nHe emphasized that Imam Hussain, along with his family, made a supreme sacrifice to ensure that the true and pure message of Islam remained alive and radiant.\nSpeaking about the women of the Ahl-e-Bait, he remarked that despite the enormity of the tragedy, their voices were never heard outside their tents, and even the sacred hair on their blessed heads remained unseen.\nToward the end of his presentation, Mr. Malik drew a parallel between the events of Karbala and the current situation in Gaza, stating: “Today’s Gaza is also a Karbala, and Islam is revived after every Karbala.”\nProminent writers from Islamabad and Rawalpindi participated in the session. A question-and-answer segment followed, during which participants shared their thoughts and reflections. The session concluded with the presidential address.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
