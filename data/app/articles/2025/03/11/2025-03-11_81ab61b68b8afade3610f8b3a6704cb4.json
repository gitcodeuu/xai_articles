As a result, arrest warrants were issued for key figures, including Ali Nawaz Awan and Raja Khurram Nawaz.\nBoth cases, in which PTI’s founder and other members are named, are related to the political party’s recent demonstrations.\nThe defendants had filed for acquittal, but no arguments could be made for their defense during today’s hearing. Judge Abbas Shah remarked that he would consider the acquittal requests only in the presence of the accused.\nThe defense lawyer argued that several cases had been decided in the absence of the PTI founder, with acquittals granted.\nHowever, the court adjourned the further hearings in the cases until April 23.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
