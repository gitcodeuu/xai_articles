Highlighting Pakistan’s energy challenges, he called for decisive action to adopt renewable energy and reduce fuel consumption.\nPrime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif echoed these sentiments, noting Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change despite contributing less than 1% to global greenhouse gas emissions.\nHe reaffirmed the government’s commitment to renewable energy expansion, plastic waste reduction, and green job creation. “Every action, no matter how small, strengthens the collective momentum toward a sustainable tomorrow,” he said.\nSenate Chairman Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani underscored the alignment of Earth Hour 2025 with World Water Day, emphasizing the urgency of addressing Pakistan’s water challenges. “Energy and water conservation are critical to mitigating environmental degradation and building climate resilience,” he added.\nHammad Naqi Khan, Director General of WWF-Pakistan, highlighted the severe climate challenges facing the country, including super floods, heatwaves, and droughts. “Earth Hour is a powerful reminder of the urgency of addressing these challenges. It is not just about switching off lights but about switching on a global movement for change,” he said.\nWWF-Pakistan organized a series of events to mark the occasion, including tree plantation drives at Karachi University and the University of Sargodha, a webinar on climate change and water challenges, and interactive activities for children at malls and museums in Islamabad, Lahore, and Karachi. Corporate partner Selimpex International also supported the initiative.\nGoodwill ambassadors, including TV actress Ushna Shah, tennis star Aisam Ul Haq, and actor Ayesha Omar, rallied behind Earth Hour by sharing messages and videos on social media. Ushna Shah remarked, “Earth Hour reminds us of our collective responsibility to create a more hopeful and resilient future for people and our planet.”\nSince its inception in 2007, Earth Hour has grown into a global phenomenon, inspiring millions to take action for the planet. In 2024, supporters worldwide contributed over 1.5 million hours to environmental causes.\nThis year, the theme “Give an Hour for Earth” encouraged individuals to spend 60 minutes doing something positive for the planet, from planting trees to raising awareness about sustainability.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
