Annual legislative calendars have been prepared to streamline session planning and parliamentary business.\nThe Prime Minister’s Public Affairs and Grievances Wing facilitated several high-profile interventions, including the safe return of IT graduates from illegal captivity in Cambodia and the swift disbursement of delayed pensions at Radio Pakistan. In another case, concerns raised by two schoolgirls from Swat about the Swat River project were promptly addressed by local authorities.\nUnder the Prime Minister’s Women Empowerment Package 2024, the Ministry played a pivotal role in establishing a Gender Mainstreaming Parliamentary Committee in the National Assembly, with representation from both Houses. Similar committees have been formed in Punjab, Sindh, Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan.\nTo improve citizen access, the Ministry introduced a Universal Access Number (UAN) for grievance registration, particularly benefiting remote areas. Daily monitoring systems and a Legislative Coordination Report have been implemented to ensure the swift resolution of complaints and legislative matters.\nTransitioning to a fully digital workspace through the e-office system has enhanced the Ministry’s operational efficiency and sustainability. Public outreach initiatives, including a Quarterly Newsletter and the upcoming Yearbook (2023-24), have further strengthened citizen engagement and transparency.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
