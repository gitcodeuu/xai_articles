However, the Finance Division approved Rs. 45 billion, which was subsequently reduced to Rs. 35 billion.\nHe further stated that the ministry has proposed Rs. 75 billion for the next financial year, with budgetary allocations to be adjusted according to the Indicative Budget Ceiling (IBC) set by the Finance Division.\nThe Secretary, Railway Board, briefed the committee that the ministry has proposed allocating 58% of the budget to infrastructure, 30% to rolling stock, and 1% each to governance and business development for ongoing projects.\nAdditionally, 8% has been earmarked for infrastructure and 2% for new schemes’ rolling stock in FY 2025-26 budgetary proposals. He provided a detailed briefing on each project.\nThe committee noted that the ministry had not provided detailed updates on the status of ongoing projects.

It also urged the Ministry of Planning, Development, and Special Initiatives to release approved funds for the rehabilitation of deteriorating railway tracks on a priority basis.\nThe Secretary, Ministry of Railways, highlighted a shortage of funds for constructing boundary walls and enhancing security at railway stations.
