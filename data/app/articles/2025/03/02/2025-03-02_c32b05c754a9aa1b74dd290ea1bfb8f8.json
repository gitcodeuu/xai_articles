Additional Inspector General Punjab Police, Muhammad Azhar Akram highlighted institutional reforms through Tahafuz and Meesaq Centres, demonstrating how community feedback shapes government responses to GBV. Panel discussions focused on behaviour change from grassroots to policy level, featuring key initiatives from both programme provinces.\nThe forum spotlighted the transformative role of women and youth in community change. Through participatory dialogue, panellists and audience members examined how women from diverse backgrounds are reshaping social narratives.\nRenowned activist Ms Zahida Hameed Qureshi emphasised the need for increased social inclusion of persons with disabilities, while representatives of religious minorities and transgender persons advocated for safe spaces promoting dialogue between vulnerable groups and wider communities.\nImplemented by the British Council and supported by FCDO, Aawaz II promotes social mobilisation through its network of village forums, district forums and Aawaz Aagahi Centres.\nThese platforms have become safe spaces where communities, especially vulnerable groups, steer efforts for social and behavioural change.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
