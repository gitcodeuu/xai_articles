The initiative, he said, successfully led to higher proportion of women’s representation in the departmental boards.\nHe pointed out that Pakistan was ranked 145th out of 146 countries on the Global Gender Gap Index, next to Afghanistan, which “did not reflect a true picture and was contrary to ground reality”. He called upon the relevant organizations to revisit the ranking and expressed the government’s readiness to share the required data.\nUN’s Resident Coordinator Mohamed Yahya said the UN was committed in supporting Pakistan to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 related to gender action plan.\nHe said gender equality needed to be recognized not as a woman specific matter, but a human issue. The launch of Islamabad’s Gender Parity Report is significant in identifying the challenges that further need attention, he added.\nChairperson Special Committee on Gender Mainstreaming Dr Nafisa Shah said women’s representation across various governmental bodies and departments remained below the targeted 33 percent benchmark. She termed their representation was essential for effective governance and smooth policy-making.\nChairperson NCSW Umme-e-Laila spoke about Pakistan’s gender parity situation, saying the women were breaking barriers in multiple sectors. As steps of empowerment, she highlighted the launch of Pink Buses for women commuters exclusively and the ‘Women on Wheels’ project which provided skillset to women for their easy and independent mobility.\nChairman Security Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Akif Saeed said under PM’s Women Empowerment Package, the SECP was tasked to nominate the private companies who had implemented family-friendly policies at their workplace. He said the companies would serve as role models in promotion of a safe working environment.\nThe prime minister gave away the Family Friendly Awards to 10 best private companies, including Alpha Beta Core Solutions, Arfa Karim Technology Incubator, Aviation MRO, Blink Capital, Funverks Global, Gift Educational, Kistpay, Laiba Enterprises, Ladies Fund Energy, and Li & Fung Pakistan.\nThe awards were based on an online survey and a scoring matrix prepared by SECP in collaboration with UN Women and Pakistan Business Council. Over 230 companies participated in the survey launched in 2024, out of which 10 were short-listed through a transparent process.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
