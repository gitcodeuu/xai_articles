We also pay tribute to former Prime Minister Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, whose legacy of leadership continues to light the path forward,” he added.\nHe stressed that acknowledging women’s contributions should go beyond celebration and translate into concrete action.\n“While Pakistan has made significant strides in women’s education, healthcare, and political participation, systemic barriers persist. Gender-based violence, economic disparities, and unequal access to opportunities remain critical challenges. Let me reaffirm my commitment, and that of the Senate, to dismantling these obstacles through progressive legislation, rigorous oversight, and accountability to ensure inclusive policies. The House of Federation stands committed to amplifying efforts to safeguard every woman’s right to safety, dignity, and self-determination.”\nAddressing the women of Pakistan, Gilani said, “To the mothers, daughters, sisters, innovators, educators, and leaders: Your strength is Pakistan’s strength. Your dreams are our nation’s blueprint.\nThis Women’s Day, “Let us ‘Accelerate Action for Gender Equality’ and pledge to build a Pakistan where no woman is left unheard, no potential unfulfilled, and no right denied. Empowered women empower nations. Together, let us forge a future where equality is non-negotiable, justice is uncompromised, and every girl’s ambition knows no bounds.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
