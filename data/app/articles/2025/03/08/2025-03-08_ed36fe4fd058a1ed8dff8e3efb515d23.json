According to Rule 79 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, when a case is registered against a Member, or a Member is arrested, convicted, or detained under an executive order, the committing judge, magistrate, or executive authority is obligated to immediately inform the Chairman Senate, specifying the reasons for the arrest, detention, or imprisonment in the prescribed format outlined in the Second Schedule.\n“Regrettably, no such intimation was received by my office in this instance, reflecting a clear violation of established parliamentary procedures and a disregard for institutional protocol,” he added.\nOn March 7, 2025, exercising his authority under Rule 84(1), the Chairman Senate reissued Production Orders for both Senator Ejaz Chaudhry and Senator Aun Abbas.\nWhile Senator Aun Abbas was produced before the Senate in partial compliance with the Orders, the directives concerning Senator Ejaz Chaudhry were once again ignored, amounting to a failure to comply with the lawful orders of the Chair.\n“This is not an unprecedented situation. When I served as Speaker of the National Assembly, a similar issue arose where Production Orders were not implemented. At that time, in the interest of upholding parliamentary privileges, I was compelled to refer the matter to the Privileges Committee,” he recalled.\nHe said that the current non-compliance with Production Orders undermines parliamentary authority. “As Chairman Senate, my sole objective is to uphold the supremacy of Parliament, the rule of law, and constitutional dictates.”\nUnder Rule 71 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, disobedience of the Chairman Senate’s Orders constitutes a breach of privilege.\n“Such disregard for parliamentary authority cannot be allowed to persist unchecked, as it threatens the institutional integrity of the Senate and the broader democratic framework,” he warned.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
