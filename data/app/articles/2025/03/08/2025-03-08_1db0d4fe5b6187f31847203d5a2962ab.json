The scandal was reported by international media, stating that Pakistan’s former prime minister had stolen 190 million pounds from the nation.\n“This is tit for tat, as he conspired against a patriotic leader, Nawaz Sharif, who is the founder of modern Pakistan, laid a network of motorways, and ended the electricity crisis,” he said, adding that today his brother Shehbaz Sharif is taking Pakistan to new heights, and his daughter Maryam Nawaz has brought a revolution of development and prosperity in Punjab.\n“It is a blessing of the Almighty that He has always chosen the PML-N to steer the country out of crises,” he said, highlighting the acknowledgment from international financial institutions regarding the national economy’s improvement.\nHe said the economic indicators are truly positive today under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif. Inflation has come down to 1.5 percent, the interest rate has been reduced to 12 percent, and the Pakistan Stock Exchange has been breaking records every other day.\nThe party of Nawaz Sharif has not only saved the country from default but also stabilized the economy and set it on the path of growth, he said, crediting the PM Shehbaz-led government’s relentless efforts and teamwork.\nOn the other hand, he said, the PTI founder poisoned the minds of the youth, incited violence, and fostered division through social media.\nHe also criticized the PTI for running malicious campaigns on social media.\n“We are proud of our soldiers who sacrifice their lives every day for safeguarding the nation,” he remarked.\nReferring to the speculations made about the economy and the country’s future one year ago, he lashed out at the PTI for contributing to economic instability and the country’s bankruptcy.\n“They wrote a letter to the IMF to disrupt its bailout program,” he remarked.\n“This was the group of Pinki, Gogi, and Kaptan who looted the country miserably,” he noted.\nHe pointed out their diminishing reputation among the masses and the spike in the PML-N’s popularity, saying that his party’s leadership had received an overwhelming response in its public gatherings in Narowal and DI Khan.\nHe expressed gratitude to the people of Gujranwala for responding to every call of the PML-N in a befitting manner.\n“This region has a political history, and I proudly say that their enthusiasm and support for the PML-N have been second to none,” he said.\nHe stated that development work is in full swing across the country as the people entrust the government with their responsibilities.\nHe also spoke about the development work in Gakhar and said that work on an eight-kilometer-long road starting from Pir Kot would now begin.\n“In the coming years, a network of development projects will be spread across this constituency,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
