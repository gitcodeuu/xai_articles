The meeting focused on strategies to regulate prices, monitor markets, and take strict action against those exploiting consumers during the holy month.\nTo address the issue of rising prices, the administration has decided to set up 17 fair price shops across the city. These shops will offer essential items at controlled rates, ensuring affordability for all citizens. Additionally, price control magistrates have been directed to intensify market inspections and remain active in the field at all times.\nDC Irfan Memon emphasized the importance of strict monitoring during Sehri and Iftar timings, when demand for essential goods typically spikes. He instructed officials to conduct special inspections during these hours to prevent overpricing and ensure compliance with government-set rates.\nMeanwhile, the administration vowed to take stringent action against hoarders and overpricing. DC Memon directed price control magistrates to expedite legal proceedings against individuals involved in hoarding essential commodities. He also stressed the need to register cases against those involved in adulteration and overcharging, commonly referred to as the “adulteration mafia.”\nTo maintain transparency and accountability, the district administration instructed all relevant officials to remain vigilant and proactive. Price control magistrates have been tasked with conducting regular inspections and submitting daily reports on market conditions. This real-time monitoring aims to address issues promptly and ensure that consumers are not exploited.\nFurthermore, the administration has also called for public cooperation in identifying and reporting instances of overpricing, hoarding, and adulteration. Citizens are encouraged to lodge complaints through designated channels, which will be addressed on a priority basis.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
