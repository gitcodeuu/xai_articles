The agency secured remand to gather more evidence and interrogate the accused.\nAccording to FIR No. C/08/2025, registered at FIA’s Anti-Corruption Circle, a complainant named Muhammad Shabbir, a resident of Sector I-10/1, Islamabad, alleged that Janjua took Rs. 3 million from him in 2014. The accused reportedly promised to arrange a government job for Shabbir’s nephew, Shehroz Iqbal, as a Naib Tehsildar in ETPB. However, neither the job was provided nor the money returned.\nThe complainant Shabbir claimed that the incident took place in front of witnesses, including Muhammad Rafique and Muzammil Hussain, at various locations in Islamabad and Rawalpindi. Following an internal inquiry, FIA sought approval from the competent authority before registering the case and proceeding with legal action.\nThe case was filed under Section 161 of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) and Section 5 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1947. FIA Sub-Inspector Shams Khan Gondal was assigned to lead the investigation.\nThe FIA sources revealed that mobile data records suggested Janjua’s involvement in widespread corruption. Based on this information, FIA decided to form a team of experienced officials to conduct a detailed inquiry and intensify the crackdown on corruption within the organization.\nThe officials also confirmed that additional complaints had been received against Janjua. The accused was allegedly involved in similar fraudulent activities, extorting large sums of money from complainants under false promises.\nFIA is expected to continue its investigation, and further developments in the case are awaited.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
