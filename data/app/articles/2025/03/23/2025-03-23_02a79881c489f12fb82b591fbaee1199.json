This year’s gathering witnessed a resounding message of unity, as representatives from various religious communities shared a common platform to promote interfaith dialogue and cooperation.\nThis year’s event, graced by Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Ali Amin Gandapur as the chief guest, was held here at the Islamabad Golf Club. On this occasion, he took the opportunity to personally engage with each distinguished guest and present them with traditional gifts as a token of goodwill. Additionally, Chief Minister Gandapur distributed shields among nominated participants, acknowledging their efforts in fostering religious harmony and understanding.\nMuhammad Israr, President of IRCRA and a prominent advocate for religious cohesion, welcomed the participants and underscored the significance of such events. He emphasized that interfaith gatherings help dispel misconceptions, encourage dialogue, and create a more inclusive society where people of all religious backgrounds can coexist peacefully.\n“Pakistan is a land of diverse cultures and faiths, and it is imperative that we continue to build bridges through dialogue and mutual understanding. Such events demonstrate our commitment to fostering peace and coexistence in all segments of society,” he remarked.\nReligious leaders, scholars, diplomats, academics, politicians and social activists from different faiths took turns to express their views, reinforcing the importance of interfaith harmony. They highlighted that respect for religious diversity is not only a moral and social necessity but also a fundamental aspect of Pakistan’s rich heritage.\nThe Interfaith Iftar Dinner concluded on a high note, with participants reaffirming their dedication to promoting peace and tolerance in their respective communities. As such initiatives continue to gain traction across Pakistan, they serve as beacons of hope for a more inclusive and harmonious future.",
