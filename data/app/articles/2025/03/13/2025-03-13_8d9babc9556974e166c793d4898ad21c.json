  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 13 (APP): Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Chaudhry Salik Hussain called for decisive global intervention to address the ongoing humanitarian and economic crisis faced by Palestinian workers in the Occupied Arab Territories (OAT).\nThe minister expressed his concerns during the 353rd Session of the Governing Body of the International Labour Organization (ILO), the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) Group, said a press release.\nChaudhry Salik Hussain, on behalf of the OIC Group, also urged the ILO and the international community to intensify efforts to support Lebanon’s recovery.\nHe called for a well-coordinated effort to rebuild Lebanon’s infrastructure, address labour shortages, and restore economic confidence.\nDuring the session, the OIC Group commended the ILO’s dedication to addressing the dire conditions of Palestinian workers and acknowledged the comprehensive report highlighting the worsening economic challenges in Gaza and the West Bank.\nThe report underscores alarming unemployment rates of 79.7% in Gaza and 34.9% in the West Bank, alongside a GDP collapse of 82% and 19%, respectively.\n“The socioeconomic crisis in the occupied Palestinian territories remains catastrophic. Decisive, immediate, and sustained action is required to rebuild critical infrastructure, restore economic resilience, and safeguard fundamental workers’ rights,” stated the OIC Group.\nThe OIC Group highlighted key issues affecting Palestinian workers, including systematic movement restrictions, prolonged economic blockades, and discriminatory labor policies. Women and vulnerable groups face disproportionate impacts, exacerbating existing inequalities and limiting access to employment opportunities.\nThe OIC Group emphasized that peace, justice, and economic recovery in Palestine are deeply interconnected. “Decent work and economic opportunities must be restored to Palestinian workers as a matter of urgency. The international community must not remain passive in the face of these ongoing injustices,” the statement urged.\nThe Group reiterated its commitment to standing in solidarity with Palestinian workers and called for immediate, collective global efforts to protect their dignity, rebuild livelihoods, and pave the way for lasting peace and prosperity.\nThe OIC Group welcomed the formation of the new government in Lebanon and reaffirmed its unwavering and unequivocal support for Lebanon’s recovery and called upon ILO member states to enhance their contribution to Lebanon’s recovery plan, working in close partnership with Lebanon’s government and social partners to build a stable, prosperous, and resilient future.",
