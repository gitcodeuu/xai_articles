The two individuals were suspects of kidnapping for ransom and latter killing of a five years old boy Inam in 2008.\nThe trial court condemned the two suspects with death penalty under the Counter Terrorism Act. The Peshawar High Court, however, converted the death penalty into life imprisonment that was challenged by the accused in the Supreme Court.\nThe Supreme Court, Thursday, acquitted the two prisoners on the basis of poor quality of evidence. The Court order says that in cases where life imprisonment or death penalty is involved, the court should be extra careful in examination of evidence. One cannot be condemned to death on the basis of poor evidence especially when the evidence is only a confession that is withdrawn latter.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
