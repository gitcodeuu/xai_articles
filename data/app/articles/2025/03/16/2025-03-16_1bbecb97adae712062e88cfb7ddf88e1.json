  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 16 (APP):The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has approved the pre-merger application for the establishment of a joint venture between National Logistics Corporation (NLC) and DP World Logistics FZE (DWLF).\nThe investment, facilitated by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), aims to enhance Pakistan’s logistics and freight industry while ensuring fair competition in the market, said a press release issued here on Sunday.\nThe transaction involves NLC acquiring a 60 percent equity stake in the joint venture, with DWLF holding the remaining 40 percent.\nThe venture aims to enhance Pakistan’s road freight logistics sector by leveraging NLC’s domestic expertise and DP World’s global supply chain solutions.\nThe relevant market for the transaction was identified as ‘road freight logistics’, a key segment in Pakistan’s trade and transport sector.\nFollowing a detailed competition assessment, CCP determined that the transaction does not result in a substantial lessening of competition or the creation of a dominant market position.\nThe review also considered horizontal overlaps in road freight logistics and potential vertical integration effects.\nThe CCP’s analysis concluded that the market remains competitive, with multiple players ensuring continued competition.\nThe joint venture highlights Pakistan’s growing appeal for foreign investment in logistics.\nIt is expected to improve infrastructure, lower transport costs, and boost Pakistan’s trade competitiveness in the region.\nLast year, the CCP facilitated transactions attracting $29.6 billion in investments from leading global companies across Pakistan’s energy, finance, telecom, and agriculture sectors.\nThis latest approval is another major transaction, paving the way for significant investment in road freight, advancing the modernization of Pakistan’s logistics industry.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
