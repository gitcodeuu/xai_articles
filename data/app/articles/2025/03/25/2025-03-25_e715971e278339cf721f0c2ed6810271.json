It was revealed that the heroin-filled capsules were found inside the woman’s stomach. The prosecutor further stated that the accused had previously filed a bail application in the High Court but later withdrew it.\nJustice Sardar Tariq Masood questioned, “How can a point that was not raised in the High Court be brought up in the Supreme Court?” He added that if the High Court had decided the matter on merit, the Supreme Court could have intervened. He advised the accused to approach the High Court again on this new ground.\nThe court was also informed that the woman was arrested at Islamabad Airport while traveling to Saudi Arabia with her husband.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
