A stop-gap arrangement was made to ensure the timely commencement of MBBS classes, with an MoU signed with the University of Narowal in September 2023 to utilize its old campus building as a temporary facility.\nThe Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department of Punjab sanctioned Rs165 million in December 2023 for renovation, procurement of equipment, furniture and fixtures.\nAcknowledging the efforts of former Punjab Chief Minister Hamza Shehbaz, Ahsan Iqbal credited the revival of Narowal Medical College to a Rs400 million grant, followed by further acceleration of the project under the leadership of Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz.\nHe expressed his pride in seeing 100 students, 67-female and 33-male, who began their medical education, with admissions approved by the Pakistan Medical & Dental Council (PM&DC).\nHe voiced his confidence that the college will soon be recognized among Pakistan’s top medical institutions, excelling in artificial intelligence, biomedicine, and modern medical research.\nThe White Coat ceremony was attended by Vice Chancellors of King Edward Medical University (KEMU) and Fatima Jinnah Medical University (FJMU), Pro-Vice Chancellor of the University of Health Sciences (UHS), and the former minister of Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Department.\nAddressing the students, Ahsan Iqbal urged them to dedicate at least a decade to rigorous study and research to establish themselves as outstanding doctors. He warned of the dangers of misinformation on social media, stressing its potential to mislead young minds. He shared a personal incident, revealing that he still carries a bullet fired by a misguided youth who was influenced by online propaganda.\nReiterating his vision for national development, he emphasized the importance of constructive dialogue and the need to prevent ideological differences from turning into hatred.\nHe declared that securing the future of these students was a collective success and a step toward national progress.\nHe also reaffirmed the government’s commitment to economic growth, referencing the “Uraan Pakistan” initiative, which aims to elevate Pakistan’s economy to USD 1 trillion by 2030.\nConcluding his speech, he praised former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for making Pakistan a nuclear power and standing firm against international pressure. He dismissed the notion that providing facilities to underdeveloped regions should be opposed, reiterating that every region, including Narowal, has the right to development and progress.",
