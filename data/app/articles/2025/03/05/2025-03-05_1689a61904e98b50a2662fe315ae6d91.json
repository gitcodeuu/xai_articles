  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 05 (APP):Security forces thwarted a terrorist attack by Fitna-al-Khwarij on Bannu Cantonment.\nIn the cowardly assault, nine innocent civilians were martyred, while 16 others sustained injuries.\nAccording to security sources, militants attempted to breach the cantonment’s perimeter by ramming two explosive-laden vehicles into its wall during Iftar, a time when the market was crowded.\nOne of the vehicles was detonated in an area adjacent to the market, resulting in civilian casualties and severe damage to a nearby mosque.\nThe targeting of innocent civilians and a mosque during the holy month of Ramazan proved that these militants have no connection to Islam.\nSecurity forces have launched a clearance operation that will continue until the complete elimination of all Khwarij elements.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
