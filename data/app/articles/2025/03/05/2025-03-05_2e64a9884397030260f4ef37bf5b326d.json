Immediate, collective action is essential to safeguard both people and the planet.”\nThe event also showcased the potential of waste as a resource. Young eco-entrepreneurs Aqsa Arshad, Noor ul Saba, and Afsheen Tajumal demonstrated how waste can be transformed into economic opportunities.\nDr. Sofia Khalid, Chairperson of Environmental Sciences at AIOU, echoed this sentiment, stating, “Waste should not be seen as a burden but as a resource. By embracing recycling and reuse, we can significantly reduce our ecological footprint.”\nHabib Malik, an expert in behavior change and communication, highlighted the importance of community engagement, saying,“Sustained behavioral change is key to eliminating open waste burning. Engaging communities through relatable and accessible communication can lead to long-term environmental stewardship.”\nThe role of social media in driving grassroots action was another key focus.\nAbid Gul, Program Manager at NICAT, noted,“A well-drafted social media strategy can transform narratives and inspire collective action. Youth-led digital advocacy has the power to shift mindsets and mobilize communities toward sustainable solutions.”\nShayan Yar, Project Director at NICAT, emphasized the potential of entrepreneurship in addressing environmental challenges, stating,“Entrepreneurship can be a powerful tool for environmental change.\nBy fostering sustainable enterprises, we can create innovative, low-cost, and scalable solutions to waste management.”\nFor participants like Haider Jalal, the boot camp was a transformative experience.\n“This boot camp has been eye-opening. I now understand the devastating impact of open waste burning and the potential of digital advocacy in driving awareness and action,” he shared.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
