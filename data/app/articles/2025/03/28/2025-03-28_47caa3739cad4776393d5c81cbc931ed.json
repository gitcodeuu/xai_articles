In addition, index descriptions and tracking difference history for ETF are also mandated.\nTo ensure consistency and accuracy in disclosures, the Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan (MUFAP) has been tasked with developing a standardized methodology for calculating the prescribed quantitative measures.\nThe enhanced disclosures will become effective immediately upon SECP’s approval of the MUFAP methodology.\nThis initiative reflects SECP’s continued commitment to improving market integrity, transparency, and investor protection in the asset management industry.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
