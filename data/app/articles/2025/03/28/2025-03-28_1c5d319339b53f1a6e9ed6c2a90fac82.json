He said it was responsibility of the state to enable the citizens to live their lives according to Islam, and added that no law could be made contrary to the teachings of Islam.\nHe vowed to make all financial resources available to equip youth with modern technology and skills, and said PM Youth Programme was created to provide education and job opportunities to youth.\nHe advised the youth to follow discipline in their lives and come up to the expectations of the nation.\nHe appealed to ulema to promote positive thinking and the habit of research so that the spread of fake news and malicious propaganda could be stopped.\nHe said the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had acknowledged that Pakistan had achieved economic stability.\nHe said Pakistan would continue to support the people of Palestine and Jammu and Kashmir in achieving their freedom from occupying forces.\nHe expressed solidarity with the people of Palestine and Kashmir who were being oppressed by the occupying forces.He said Israel killed 50,000 Palestinians and had violated the cease-fire, and again began to kill people in Palestine.\nAt the end of the ceremony, the prime minister met the ulema and families of martyrs.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
