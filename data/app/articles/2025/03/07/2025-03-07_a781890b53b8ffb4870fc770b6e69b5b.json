It is believed to be the day when Prophet Adam (AS) was created and later expelled from Jannah.\nSeveral key events in Islamic history, including the arrival of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in Madinah and the decisive Battle of Badr, also took place on a Friday. Due to its importance, the Jummah prayer is considered equivalent to the five daily obligatory prayers, and missing it without a valid reason is regarded as a sin.\nWomen also observed the blessed occasion in their homes, offering prayers and engaging in religious gatherings. Aasia, a newlywed housewife, marked her first Jummah of Ramadan with her in-laws.\n“It is a special day for me. I prayed alongside my mother-in-law and sister-in-law, and together, we contributed to purchasing food rations for underprivileged families,” she said.\n“May Allah accept our good deeds,” she added with a heartfelt prayer.\nIslamic teachings emphasize that Jummah is a day of forgiveness, with Allah Almighty multiplying the rewards for good deeds performed on this day.\nThe first Friday serves as a powerful reminder of the values that define this sacred month, encouraging believers to seek closeness to Allah through prayer, charity, and acts of kindness.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
