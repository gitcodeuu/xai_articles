From classrooms to boardrooms, fields to front-lines, resilient Pakistani women are redefining possibilities to shape a bright future for our nation,” the prime minister remarked.\nHe highlighted that this year’s theme, “For ALL Women and Girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment”, was a call to action, reminding us of the shared responsibility to create a society where women thrive and contribute meaningfully.\n“Our religion, Islam, places great emphasis on the dignity and rights of women. Pakistan has made significant strides in advancing women’s rights through our government’s concerted efforts, including policy interventions, legal reforms, and institutional support,” he said adding “Our journey towards true gender equality is far from over.\nEmpowering women is no longer an option; it is now an imperative for the prosperity and progress of Pakistan. When we invest in women’s education, health, and economic independence, we uplift not just individuals but generations”.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
