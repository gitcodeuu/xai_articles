Equality. Empowerment.”, reinforced the need for collective action to ensure that every woman and girl had equal access to rights and opportunities, he added.\nThe President said, “Women constitute almost half of our population and empowering them is essential for our national progress. Societies that provide equal rights and opportunities for women are more prosperous, peaceful, and resilient.\nWhen women are given access to education, economic opportunities, and leadership roles, entire communities benefit.\nUnfortunately, many women still have to face violence, discrimination, and barriers to their full participation in society.”\nHe said, “Over the years, we have taken key steps, including the enactment of laws against domestic violence, workplace harassment, and gender-based discrimination. Similarly, specialised courts and helplines for survivors of gender-based violence have strengthened protections. Pakistan has taken steps to increase women’s representation in politics, judiciary, law enforcement, and public institutions, besides undertaking economic initiatives to promote financial inclusion, entrepreneurship, and digital literacy for women.”\nHe said, “We should ensure an inclusive and equitable society and take more steps to further improve policies to support women’s safety, education, and economic independence. Our businesses and private sector should also provide equal opportunities, fair wages, and safe workplaces for women. By ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women, we can build a stronger, more progressive, and just society for future generations.”\n“On this International Women’s Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to empower every woman to help her achieve her full potential,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
