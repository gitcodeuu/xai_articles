The intended participants can visit the ECO Science Foundation website: www.ecosf.org.\nThis webinar promises to offer deep insights into both the theoretical beauty and real-world significance of the Moving Sofa Problem.\nIt is a unique opportunity for students, researchers, and professionals in mathematics, physics, and engineering to engage with an expert and explore one of the most intriguing unsolved problems in mathematics.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
