Tragically, 21 individuals and four soldiers got martyred, prior to the operation’s commencement.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has commended the security forces’ bravery and professionalism for conducting a successful operation and prayed to the Almighty for those who got martyred before the commencement of operation, he\nnoted.\nThe Minister vehemently condemned the propaganda disseminated by Indian media by spreading fake information to achieve their ulterior motives.\nHighlighting a nexus between them and the terrorists, he said it seemed that the Indian media was all set to report on the tragedy with beforehand provision of the information.\n“Videos are out there now and how can they refute the drone footage taken through thermal cameras,” he questioned.\nHe emphasized the advanced technology employed by the Pakistan Army, which played a pivotal role in the operation’s success.\nExpressing deep disappointment, the minister criticized the PTI for exploiting the tragedy for political gain, accusing them of aligning with the Indian media and BLA narratives.\nHe asserted that PTI’s actions aligned with foreign interests, urging them to prioritize national unity over political opportunism.\nHe further condemned media personalities abroad for perpetuating Indian media’s misinformation.\nThe minister vowed to combat misinformation, highlighting the narrative battle fought during the operation.\nHe said the operation is a defeat for the BLA and Indian media, and a matter of shame for PTI’s propaganda against national interests.\nReiterating the government’s unwavering commitment to eradicating terrorism, the Minister affirmed the resolve of the\nPrime Minister, Chief of Army Staff, and security forces to pursue terrorists and their handlers relentlessly.\nHe said the Prime Minister had talked with the Chief Minister of Balochistan over the matter and would visit the province tomorrow to address the public over future course of action against terrorism.",
