  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 12 (APP):Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) Balochistan leader and Member of the National Assembly (MNA) Nawabzada Jamal Khan Raisani has said that terrorism in Balochistan is not an indigenous movement but a nefarious conspiracy by external elements to destabilize Pakistan.\nIn a tweet, he reiterated that terrorists operating in Balochistan are neither Baloch, nor do they belong to Balochistan, Pakistan, or Islam.\nHe emphasized that these individuals are merely foreign proxies being used to create instability and mislead the youth of Balochistan.\nJamal Raisani said that terrorists and their facilitators have failed to realize that every bullet fired at a Punjabi, Sindhi, Saraiki, or Pashtoon is essentially an attack on a Baloch and every citizen of Balochistan. “We are one nation, and an attack on one of us is an attack on all,” he asserted.\nHe further stated that Pakistan’s security forces have once again demonstrated that the country will never bow down to terrorism. The successful and decisive operation against the 33 terrorists involved in the train hijacking sends a clear message that every attempt to spread chaos in Pakistan will be thwarted.\nRaisani praised the sacrifices of Pakistan’s brave armed forces and their unwavering commitment to ensuring public safety.\nHe reaffirmed that Pakistan and Balochistan stand united against all enemies who seek to harm peace and stability in the region.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
