According to the notification, an officer can be considered for promotion twice.\nJustice Sardar Ijaz Ishaq Khan said that in this case, this court cannot look at this notification.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer said that for promotion in Grade 22, there should be three best personal evaluation reports of the last six years.\nThe court adjourned the hearing of the case until Friday, March 14, upholding the order not to convene the meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
