Other distinguished speakers included Dr Israr Madani, Founder President of the International Research Council for Religious Affairs (IRCRA); Dr Mujeeb Afzal, Associate Professor at Quaid-i-Azam University; Prof Dr Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, Director General of the Islamic Research Institute at International Islamic University Islamabad (IIUI); Dr Greg Simons, Professor of Journalism at Daffodil International University; and Dr Sofya Ragozina, Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Institute of Oriental Studies, Russian Academy of Sciences, said a press release.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood, Director General ISSI, highlighted Pakistan’s pivotal role in international advocacy, particularly through the designation of March 15 as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia by the UN.\nDespite some legislative steps in Sweden, Denmark, and the U.S., Ambassador Mahmood highlighted persistent and increasing Islamophobic incidents in Europe, the U.S. and India. He underscored the urgent need for implementation of UN resolutions and for the international community to forge unity and work together, fostering understanding, tolerance and mutual respect. He further stressed that people of goodwill in all faiths should make their rightful contribution towards building a world that respects diversity, pluralism, and interfaith harmony.\nIn a video message, H.E. Hissein Brahim Taha, Secretary General of the OIC, described the proclamation of the International Day against Islamophobia by the United Nations as a significant milestone in combating religious discrimination.\nHe expressed concern over the rise in anti-Muslim incidents globally, including online hate speech and attacks on places of worship, which threaten human dignity and religious freedom. He stressed that this challenge demands collective action and innovative responses, affirming OIC’s commitment to effective strategies against Islamophobia, strengthening legal protections for minorities, and combating religious hatred through dialogue and mutual respect.\nIn his keynote address, Prof Dr Anis Ahmad characterized Islamophobia as a socially constructed phenomenon rooted in unjustifiable fear and distorted perceptions of Islam and Muslims, resulting in harassment, discrimination, exclusion, and violation of fundamental human rights globally.\nDrawing from the Runnymede Trust Report (1997) and recent academic studies, he highlighted the media’s role in perpetuating negative stereotypes and the global spread of Islamophobia, including in non-Western countries like India. Dr. Ahmad emphasised institutionalized educational biases that glorify imperial narratives and depict Muslims negatively. He advocated for decolonization of social sciences, projection of strengths and positive dimensions of Islam and Muslims, need for critical thinking, empathy and justice, universal ethical values, respect for dignity, religious freedom, and educational reforms to accurately represent Islam and Muslims.\nProf Dr Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq traced the historical origins of Islamophobia to medieval Europe and highlighted its perpetuation through Orientalism and colonial narratives. He underscored the critical need for interfaith dialogue and educational reforms, emphasizing Pakistan’s stability as essential to strengthening the broader Muslim community globally.\nDr Israr Madani discussed the significant rise of Islamophobia post-9/11, driven largely by Western media portrayals associating Islam with security threats. He recognized emerging global awareness and counter-efforts through advocacy, education, and alternative media.\nDr Greg Simons critically examined Western media’s role in exacerbating Islamophobic perceptions post-9/11, asserting that Islamophobia has been politically instrumentalized to justify foreign interventions. He proposed leveraging alternative media to challenge these biased narratives effectively.\nDr. Mujeeb Afzal explained Islamophobia in the context of India, attributing it to historical narratives from the era of Muslim dynasties through colonial rule, and subsequent marginalization under Hindu nationalism. He critiqued contradictions within Nehruvian secularism, which masked grassroots communal politics.\nDr. Sofya emphasized proactive measures to address Islamophobia, advocating for positive representations of Islam rooted in universal ethical values. She called for substantial academic and curricular reforms to instil a confident Muslim identity among youth.\nThe seminar concluded with the Chairman BOG ISSI stressing Islamophobia as a critical human rights concern, calling for sustained global cooperation through education, legal reforms, interfaith dialogue, and responsible media engagement. The event witnessed broad participation from diplomats, academicians, scholars, and students, reflecting robust engagement on the issue.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
