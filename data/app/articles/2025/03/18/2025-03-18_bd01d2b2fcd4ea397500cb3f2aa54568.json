Through initiatives like Benazir Kafaalat, which provides financial assistance to women, Benazir Taleemi Wazaif, which supports the education of children from low-income families, and Benazir Nashonuma, which addresses malnutrition among children and pregnant women, BISP has disbursed over PKR 400 billion.

This initiative is designed to help poor households become self-sufficient through skill development and micro-enterprise opportunities.\nFor the fiscal year 2023-24, BISP was allocated PKR 471.149 billion, out of which PKR 471.048 billion was utilized, reflecting an impressive financial performance of 99.8 percent.

Additionally, a Memorandum of Agreement was signed for a heavy machinery training program, providing technical skills and employment opportunities for underprivileged individuals. In August 2024, IFAD conducted a review of the National Poverty Graduation Programme and awarded it a high rating for its effectiveness in reducing poverty.\nThe Ministry of Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety remains committed to expanding its social protection programs and ensuring financial security for Pakistan’s most vulnerable communities.
