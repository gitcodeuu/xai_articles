The university’s commitment to excellence has earned it numerous national and international accolades, reinforcing its reputation as a center of academic and professional distinction.\nMost notably, Prof. Mukhtar, along with the Additional Registrar and four senior faculty members, was recently awarded the prestigious Badge of Excellence by the European Training Foundation, a flagship initiative of the European Union. This honor is bestowed upon professionals who demonstrate unwavering dedication to self-assessment, institutional development, and the continuous enhancement of vocational education standards.\nAs a UNESCO-UNEVOC center, NSU has strengthened its global footprint through more than two dozen active international partnerships. The university’s engagement in key initiatives, such as the Bridging Innovation and Learning in TVET (BILT) program—sponsored by the German government under UNESCO’s umbrella—underscores its commitment to modernizing technical and vocational education in line with global best practices.\nAmong its most promising initiatives, NSU has launched a pioneering Mechanical Engineering Technology program that provides students with a fully funded one-year scholarship to gain hands-on experience in China’s industrial sector before completing their degrees. This initiative reflects the university’s proactive approach to industry-driven learning and global workforce readiness.\nThe rapid rise of NSU Islamabad as a hub for vocational excellence underscores the transformative potential of skills-based education in driving economic growth. With this latest recognition, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Mukhtar continues to shape the future of Pakistan’s technical education landscape, bridging the gap between academia and industry while fostering a new generation of skilled professionals poised for global success.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
