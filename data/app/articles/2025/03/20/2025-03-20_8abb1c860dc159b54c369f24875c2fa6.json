We have the opportunity of ending polio if the Pakistan-led response is intensified with the support of all partners.”\n“WHO will be standing side by side with Pakistan to run together the last mile to end the global threat of polio, for our children and our grandchildren.”\nMs. Melissa Corkum, UNICEF’s Chief of Polio in Pakistan, emphasized the importance of integrating polio eradication with broader child health initiatives. “Polio eradication is not just about delivering vaccines, it is about ensuring every child has access to the healthcare they need to thrive,” she remarked.\nAs the Government of Pakistan and its partners intensify efforts in the months ahead, today’s gathering reaffirmed that collaboration, sustained funding, and community engagement remain pivotal in achieving the shared vision of a polio-free Pakistan.",
