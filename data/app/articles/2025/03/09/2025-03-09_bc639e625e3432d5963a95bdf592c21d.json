You strive to enhance its respectability while following rules and regulations.”\nHe commented on the referral of both senators to the Privileges Committee, stating that it is essential to observe what role the committee plays in this matter. “We should not turn this into a contentious issue, as fundamentally, we have no disagreement,” he remarked. The senator reiterated the need for collaboration and support amongst members during these challenging times.\nThe senator also reflected on historical hardships faced by political leaders in past like Nawaz Sharif, and Maryam Nawaz, emphasizing that many have endured significant struggles.\nHe noted that “imprisonment has been a part of the political landscape,” referencing the lengthy sentences served by various leaders in the past.
