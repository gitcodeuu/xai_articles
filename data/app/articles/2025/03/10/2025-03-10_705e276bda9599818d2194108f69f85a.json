  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 10 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday directed the relevant ministries, State Bank of Pakistan and private partners to revisit the ongoing awareness drive on the Rs20 billion Ramazan Package to enhance its effectiveness and outreach and address the gap between the disbursement and withdrawal.\nThe prime minister, during his visit to the National Telecommunication Corporation Headquarters to monitor the execution of the program, was told that the around 2.8 million entitled accounts had been credited with Rs5,000 each and 683,000 of those had withdrawn the amount.\n“As 94% of accounts had been established, the withdrawal ratio is just 22%. There is a big gap between disbursement and withdrawal which shows a lack of awareness among the people,” the prime minister remarked and also asked the SBP governor to join the campaign to make as many people as possible benefit from the program.\nHe appreciated the relevant ministries and partners for the construction and execution of this “comprehensive and wonderful” program and accepting the challenge of supporting the entitled deserving people during the holy month of Ramazan.\n“This was a new concept to say goodbye to the Utility Stores forever due to the massive complaints of “worst” corruption of pubic money, which was also an injustice to the common man. The issue of poor quality and corruption have been done away with through a new modern digital wallet,” he remarked.\nThe prime minister said that four million families comprising over 20 million people from across the country would benefit from the program which was the first ever such initiative by the government to disburse the cash amount through a transparent mechanism without any issues of quality or transparency. The provision of Rs5,000 to each family would enable the beneficiary family to purchase the commodities of their own choice, he added.\nHe said that a validation system was a main component of the program, providing immediate correction of any mistake.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz also urged the people to call the program helpline 9999 to get their financial support without any delay.\nThe prime minister also made a call to the helpline and asked the call agent about the functioning of the program and any issues being faced during the process.\nHe said that as the ongoing Ramazan Package was the first such facility, the private partners should suggest ways to expand the cash disbursal mechanism to a maximum level.\nDuring the briefing, the prime minister was given an overview of the live monitoring system. It was told that over 60 people were serving at the call center.\nIT Minister Shaza Fatima Khawaja told that since the launch of the program, 689,000 calls had been received of which 522,000 were addressed through an automated system of IVR and the rest 90,000 by the call agents.\nIt was told that 94% accounts had been established while Rs14 billion had already been credited and 683,000 have withdrawn the amount. Besides, a track and trace system was in place to undo any wrong transaction without any delay.\nIshtiaq Ahmed, APP’s Foreign Editor, leads coverage of the Prime Minister, President and Foreign Office, bringing over 20 years of journalism experience from local and international publications – Reach out at 03335293238/ ishtiaqrao@gmail.com/ X: ishtiaqrao",
