This number is more than the glaciers present anywhere except in the polar regions of the earth,” he added.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan was among the top countries affected by climate change.\nDue to climate change, the weather was changing and the average temperature was rising, resulting in rapid melting of more than 10,000 glaciers, he noted.\nResultantly, he said because of floods and drought, rivers, agriculture and millions of people working in the sector were facing dangers.\nHe said due to melting of glaciers, thousands of new lakes were formed, increasing the danger of devastating floods.\nHe said the floods of 2022 had made it clear that Pakistan was facing severe dangers of climate change.\nThese floods caused devastation among the population living along streams and rivers and in the plains resulting in overall economic losses of $30 billion dollars, he added.\nAs one of the most affected countries, the prime minister said Pakistan needed further cooperation in different areas including the programme to monitor glaciers, early forecasting system, for adoption of agricultural practices to protect against the ill effects of climate change and to attract investment for alternative solutions to store water.\nHe said, “We need to promote environmental tourism at the international level according to set guidelines in order to stop destruction of precious tourist assets from poisonous substances and pollution.”\nHe said everyone needed to take practical steps for protection of glaciers because in case glaciers disappeared then livelihoods connected to them would also be destroyed.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
