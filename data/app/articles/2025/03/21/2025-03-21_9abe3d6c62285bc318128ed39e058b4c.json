Additionally, various aspects of the project were discussed during the meeting.\nThe Minister clarified that under any procurement model, the National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) must retain control over the transmission system and operations, while tariffs will be determined according to NEPRA regulations to ensure the sustainability of the project.\nAwais Leghari also emphasized that, while the project has numerous benefits, its success depends on the effective resolution of the “right of way” issue. Until this challenge is addressed, effective implementation of the project will not be possible.\nMinister of State Mr. Abdul Rehman Kanju also participated in the meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
