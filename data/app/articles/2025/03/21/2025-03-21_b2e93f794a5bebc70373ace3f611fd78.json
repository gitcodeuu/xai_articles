The government’s policy prohibits the appointment of dual citizens to high-ranking positions.\nJustice Jamal Mandokhail commented that for the high standard of candidates being sought, some compromises might be necessary. He noted that the real issue lies with the provinces and questioned how the authority would function there. The Additional Attorney General responded that members from the provinces had already been appointed to the authority.\nJustice Amin-ud-Din remarked that Faisal Amin had been nominated as the climate change member from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and noted that he is the Chief Minister’s brother. A university vice-chancellor had been appointed as a member from Balochistan.\nJustice Jamal Mandokhail said that he knew the member from Balochistan and noted that the individual had no expertise in this field. Members from Punjab and Sindh had been nominated from the bureaucracy. The Additional Attorney General stated that the provinces would be contacted to nominate technocrats.\nJustice Jamal Mandokhail inquired whether the authority’s rules had been formulated. The Additional Attorney General replied that a draft of the rules had been prepared and would be sent to the Ministry of Law for approval.\nDuring the hearing, Secretary of Climate Change Zulfiqar Younus informed the court that 752 applications had been received last time. Justice Jamal Mandokhail asked why the other two shortlisted candidates had not been considered. The secretary responded that the remaining two candidates did not fully meet the criteria. He added that some applicants reside abroad and face delays in coming to Pakistan.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer, Mian Samiuddin, argued before the court that this is a case related to fundamental rights and that finding a purely Pakistani expert seemed difficult. He noted that the Climate Change Authority had been inactive since 2017.\nSubsequently, the court adjourned the hearing for one month.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
