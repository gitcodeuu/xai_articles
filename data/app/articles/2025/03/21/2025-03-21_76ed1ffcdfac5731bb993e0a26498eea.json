The introduction of new locomotives and the refurbishment of passenger coaches are other initiatives undertaken in recent years, he added.\nRevenue has increased from Rs. 47.58 billion in 2019-20 to Rs. 88.73 billion in 2023-24, reflecting an 86.5% growth. “This remarkable progress underscores improved governance and service quality across the board,” Kayani said.\nPakistan Railways is also focusing on strengthening freight operations to increase revenue and achieve financial sustainability.\nKayani acknowledged that Pakistan Railways operates on an aging 10,633 km track network, posing serious challenges to repair and maintenance. “Delays in maintenance and operational inefficiencies stem largely from this outdated infrastructure,” he said.\nAmong the completed PSDP projects, the Minister listed immediate track safety works in Karachi and Sukkur Divisions, reconstruction of assets damaged during the 2010 floods, and rehabilitation of Karachi Port Trust (KPT) rail connectivity.\nOngoing PSDP projects include essential track safety works on the Rohri-Khanpur, Tando Adam-Rohri, Kiamari-Hyderabad, and Khanewal-Shorkot-Faisalabad-Qila Sheikhupura-Shandara sections, among others.\nFor 2025-26, the Minister announced plans for track rehabilitation between Hyderabad-New Chhor, Rawalpindi-Hasanabdal, Lahore-Lalamusa-Rawalpindi, Shandara-Kala Khatai, and the procurement of track machines for mechanized maintenance.\n“The future of Pakistan Railways depends on securing adequate funding, material, machinery, and human resources. Without these essentials, no management practice can deliver effectively,” the Minister added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
