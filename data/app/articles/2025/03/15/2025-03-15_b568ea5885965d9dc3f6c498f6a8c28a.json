  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 15 (APP):Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Saturday said that on the occasion of international day to combat Islamophobia, Pakistan urged the international community to implement tangible and effective measures to reform discriminatory legislation, combat hate speech, and promote genuine interfaith dialogue to cultivate mutual respect.\n“Pakistan reiterates its dedication to promoting tolerance, harmony, and mutual respect among all religions and cultures. The rising instances of Islamophobic rhetoric, hate speech, and assaults on Muslim communities, mosques, and sacred symbols are deeply troubling and completely unacceptable, necessitating immediate and strong global response,” the DPM/FM said in a message on the observance of International Day to Combat Islamophobia.\nThe DPM/FM said desecration of the Holy Quran and the ongoing marginalization of Muslims worldwide represented not only assaults on Islamic values but also serious violations of fundamental human rights and the principles of religious freedom.\nPakistan had been a leading force in the global fight against Islamophobia, he said, adding working closely with the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Pakistan played a crucial role in the United Nations General Assembly’s (UNGA) historic decision to designate March 15 as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.\nFollowing this, he said Pakistan was pivotal in the passage of another UNGA resolution urging all states to implement laws to criminalize acts of Islamophobia, as well as requiring the UN Secretary-General to appoint a Special Envoy to address the issue.\nDar further stressed that additionally, social media platforms should take significant responsibility by holding accountable those who propagate hate and ensuring the removal of harmful content that reinforces Islamophobia.\n“Education plays a vital role in breaking down prejudice and fostering a more inclusive and compassionate perspective. Let this day act as a strong call to action — a chance to build a world in which individuals of all beliefs can live together harmoniously, where understanding prevails over fear, and where mutual respect transcends divisions,” Foreign Office Spokesperson, in a press release, quoted him as saying.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
