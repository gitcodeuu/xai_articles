The purpose of observing this day is also to raise awareness about the dangerous consequences of Islamophobia,” President Secretariat Press Wing, in a press release on Saturday, quoted the president as saying.\nGillani further said that the Muslims across the world encountered numerous challenges due to the misconceptions and negative propaganda spread against them and their religion.\nIn many Western countries, he observed Islamophobia led to violent incidents in which different innocent Muslims had lost their lives, adding on this day, they also remembered those Muslims who lost their lives as a result of Islamophobic-related violence.\nThe president said Pakistan took pride in its leading role in getting the international day recognized by the United Nations to combat Islamophobia.\n“Pakistan has consistently highlighted this issue at every fora and has played a key role in urging the international community to take practical steps for its eradication,” he added.\nAt times, he regretted that the Western media associated Islam and Muslims with terrorism or extremism, creating a misleading perception among the general public.\nMoreover, false information and fake news on social media portrayed Islam as a violent religion, he noted.\nThe president said additionally, in some countries, political groups and extremist individuals ran hate campaigns against the Muslims and exploit Islamophobia for political purposes, further exacerbating discrimination against Muslims.\nGillani urged the Muslims to use various media platforms to promote the true, peaceful, and human rights-based teachings of Islam.\nFurthermore, he opined the Muslims living in Western countries should maintain their identity while playing a positive and constructive role in their societies.\nThe president reiterated that Pakistan would continue its struggle against Islamophobia at the global level and defend the rights of Muslims at every platform.\n“Pakistan reaffirms its commitment to working with the international community to end Islamophobia through diplomatic, political, and social efforts,” he added.\nHe further urged the global leaders, media and civil society to take practical steps to eliminate hatred against Islam and the Muslims.\n“Let us all come together to promote tolerance, brotherhood, and peace and create a world where every human being is treated with dignity, respect, and equal rights,” he stressed.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
