They also called for international legislation to prevent blasphemous actions carried out under the pretext of free speech.\nThey emphasized the strict enforcement of Pakistan’s existing laws on the protection of the sanctity of Prophethood Peace Be Upon Him while ensuring that these laws are not misused to falsely accuse innocent individuals.\nReligious scholars and clerics across the country were urged to highlight the importance of protecting the sanctity of the Prophet Peace Be Upon Him in their Friday sermons, educate the youth on the responsible and constructive use of social media, and discourage the sharing of blasphemous or inflammatory content. Public awareness was encouraged to ensure that any violations are addressed through legal channels, rather than through unlawful actions.\nIt was announced that the upcoming National Seerat-un-Nabi Peace Be Upon Him Conference will focus on the theme: “State Responsibilities in Educating and Training Youth for Responsible Social Media Use – In Light of the Seerat-un-Nabi Peace Be Upon Him.” The conference will explore effective strategies to guide young people in using social media in alignment with Islamic teachings.\nThe youth of Pakistan were specifically urged not to share any blasphemous content and instead report such incidents to the relevant authorities.
