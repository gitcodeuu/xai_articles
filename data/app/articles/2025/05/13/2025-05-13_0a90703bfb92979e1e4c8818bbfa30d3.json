Under the courageous leadership of Army Chief General Syed Asim Munir, all the Zionist entities backing India against Pakistan have also encountered disgrace. The managing director further remarked that cultured and thriving societies always remember their heroes; the enemy seeks to diminish our strength by fostering division and animosity within us. It is essential that we all set aside our political differences and grievances to collaborate for the economic growth and prosperity of Pakistan, while effectively confronting any potential threats in the future.On this occasion, prayers were offered for the civilians and military members who were martyred due to the enemy’s aggression during the “Marka-e-Haq” as well as for the protection of the homeland.
