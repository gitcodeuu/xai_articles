She praised the Pakistani forces, describing them as a ‘steel wall’ against enemies. Initiatives like Bunyan-al-Marsoos, she added, are a continuation of the ideology of Youm-e-Takbir.\nDespite India’s provocations, Mushaal emphasized that Pakistan has always preferred peace. She clarified that Pakistan’s desire for peace is not a sign of weakness but a reflection of a civilized state. As a responsible nuclear power, Pakistan has maintained balance in the region, she said.\nMushaal said, no force can bend a united nation with sincere leadership. The green crescent flag, she noted, continues to announce Pakistan’s sovereignty to the world, symbolizing the nation’s strength and resilience.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
