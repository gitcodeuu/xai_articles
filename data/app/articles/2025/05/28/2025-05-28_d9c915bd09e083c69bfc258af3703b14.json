Now, under the leadership of PM Shehbaz Sharif, Pakistan has successfully shot down six Indian warplanes including Rafale aircraft.\nHe opined that this victory was part of the continuity that began in 1998 and continued with full force even today.\nPakistan’s defense was in strong hands, Attaullah Tarar said the nation had full confidence in its armed forces, scientists and political leadership.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
