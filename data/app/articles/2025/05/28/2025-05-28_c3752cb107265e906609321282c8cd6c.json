She asserted that as a nuclear power, Pakistan has every right to decisively respond to any aggression.\nReferring to India’s cowardly attack under the cover of darkness, she praised Field Marshal Hafiz Saeed Asim Munir, the Chiefs of Air and Naval Staff, and the brave officers and soldiers of the armed forces for repelling the aggression and setting a new example of valor, reigniting the spirit of sacrifice among the youth.\nOther speakers at the event, including parliamentarians, described Youm-e-Takbeer as a golden chapter in Pakistan’s history of defense and security. They lauded the visionary leadership of PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif and the armed forces, which has made Pakistan stronger and more secure. They reiterated that while Pakistan is a peace-loving nation, any future aggression by its arch-rival will be met with an unforgettable response.\nThe event was attended by members of national and provincial assemblies, Commissioner Rawalpindi, Deputy Commissioner Rawalpindi, Vice-Chancellor of Fatima Jinnah University, government officials, prominent figures from various fields, and a large number of students.\nStudents expressed their love for Pakistan through national songs and speeches, paying rich tributes to the heroes of Youm-e-Takbeer.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
