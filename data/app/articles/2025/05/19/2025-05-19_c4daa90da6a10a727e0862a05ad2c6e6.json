  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 19 (APP): A fire broke out once again in Islamabad’s Margalla Hills, prompting an emergency response from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and district administration officials.\nAccording to the spokesman of Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration here, firefighters from the Capital Development Authority (CDA) were called into action after a blaze erupted in the Margalla Hills. He said that more than 70 firefighters were taking part in the operation to control the fire.\nDistrict administration officers also reached the site to support the efforts and confirmed that the fire had been brought under control earlier in the day, but it reignited due to dry conditions and wind.\n“Efforts are underway again. Our teams are working to bring the situation under control shortly,” the spokesman said.\nThe fire started in a forested area, causing concern among authorities and residents due to the ecological importance of the hills. These hills are part of the Margalla Hills National Park, which hosts a wide range of plant and animal life.\nCDA’s fire brigade teams moved quickly after receiving alerts from their monitoring units. Teams were deployed from multiple locations to ensure the fire did not spread further. The thick vegetation and uneven terrain, however, made the firefighting task more difficult.\nWater tankers, fire extinguishers, and manual tools were being used by the teams. Volunteers from local communities and park staff also joined the operation.\nThe spokesman said that although the fire had been brought under control once, the area needed continuous monitoring. The flames flared up again in the afternoon, and fresh teams were sent to stop it from reaching nearby areas.\nMeanwhile, the district administration officers coordinated with CDA and emergency teams to assess the damage and ensure safety.\nThe cause of the fire is still being investigated. Initial reports suggest it may have been triggered by human activity or dry weather.\nThe CDA has asked people visiting the hills to avoid lighting fires or leaving behind materials that can catch fire, such as glass bottles or plastic.\nOfficials said firefighting operations would continue until the fire is completely put out and the area declared safe. Monitoring teams will remain on duty throughout the night, and more updates are expected by Monday morning.\nCDA teams remain on high alert, and further resources will be deployed if required.",
