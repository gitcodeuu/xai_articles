He noted that the ministry has already activated a comprehensive logistical plan to facilitate the pilgrims’ journey from their departure to their return ensuring full support throughout their stay in Makkah and Madinah.\nSince its inception in 1417 AH, the Guests Program has hosted more than 64,000 pilgrims from across the Muslim world. The initiative underscores Saudi Arabia’s role as a central pillar of the Islamic world and guardian of the Two Holy Mosques.",
