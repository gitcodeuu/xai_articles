The declaration emphasized that Kashmir should not be viewed merely as a territorial issue, but as a moral, legal, and humanitarian crisis with far-reaching global implications.\nThe Sawera Foundation also announced the launch of the Sawera Peace & Justice Initiative, a new platform dedicated to promoting nonviolence, peace education, and youth engagement in conflict-affected areas.\nThe event concluded with broad consensus among participants that genuine peace is defined not by the absence of violence, but by the presence of justice, freedom, and the right to meaningful self-determination for the people of Jammu and Kashmir. Attendees reaffirmed their commitment to nonviolent action and international solidarity, urging the global community to respond with urgency, empathy, and determination.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
