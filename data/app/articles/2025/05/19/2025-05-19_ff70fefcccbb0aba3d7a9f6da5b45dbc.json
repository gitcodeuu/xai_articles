He also alleged that Indian proxies operating in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa faced strong resistance, prompting India to resort to acts of aggression.\nDr. Fazal Chaudhry reaffirmed the government’s commitment to economic reform and attracting foreign investment through institutional modernization and security improvements.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
