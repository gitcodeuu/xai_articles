The program also includes timely advisories for Rabi and Kharif crops to support the agricultural sector.\nIn response to a supplementary question from MNA Umair Niazi, Dr. Shaza highlighted that decreasing rainfall and population growth are contributing to water scarcity. She said the Prime Minister has formed a task force to promote crops that require less water and to reduce the cultivation of water-intensive crops.\n“We are moving towards drip irrigation to conserve water,” she added, while emphasizing that inter-provincial cooperation is underway to address water distribution issues.\nAnswering another question from MNA Zartaj Gul, the Minister said the government is carefully reviewing and implementing key climate policies. “We raise our voice for climate justice at every international forum,” she affirmed.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
