  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 10 (APP):Pakistan launched precision missile strikes against India under Operation Bunyaan al Marsoos, symbolizing unity and steadfast national defense.\nThe operation’s name—meaning “a structure firmly joined together”—draws inspiration from Surah Al-Saff (61-4) which praises those who fight in Allah’s cause as a solid, fortified structure.\nChief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir offered Fajr prayers and recited Surah Al-Saff before the operation commenced, invoking divine guidance.\n“Indeed, Allah loves those who fight in His cause in a row as though they are a structure joined firmly. (Surah Al-Saff, verse 4)\nThe action reflects Pakistan’s resolve and collective strength in the face of external aggression.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
