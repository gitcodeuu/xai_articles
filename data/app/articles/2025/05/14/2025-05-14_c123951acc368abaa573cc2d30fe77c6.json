  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 14 (APP): Ministry of Maritime Affairs has initiated the development of a comprehensive Blue Economy Policy to unlock the full potential of Pakistan’s maritime sector to generate over $100 billion annually.\nFederal Minister for Maritime Affairs, Muhammad Junaid Anwar Chaudhry, chairing a high-level meeting, directed the ministry to accelerate the policy development process and emphasized the importance of timely and inclusive policy formation, highlighting the economic opportunities the blue economy presents for Pakistan, said a press release issued here on Wednesday.\n“All stakeholders, including relevant ministries, provincial governments, industry experts, and academic institutions, will be consulted to ensure a collaborative, effective policy framework,” said the federal minister. “The blue economy is no longer a concept of the future, it is a priority for today.”\nThe blue economy is a sustainable use of ocean and marine resources to promote economic growth, improve livelihoods, create jobs, and maintain environmental sustainability while preserving the health of ocean ecosystems.\nThe federal minister Junaid Anwar Chaudhry noted that Pakistan’s contribution currently is around $1 billion annually, which accounts for just 0.4% of the national GDP with the potential to generate over $100 billion annually if fully optimized.\n“This revenue is primarily derived from fisheries, coastal tourism, and maritime trade. Notably, seafood exports contribute roughly $450 million, while maritime tourism generates about $300 million each year, the federal minister added.\nThe minister said estimates suggest potential revenues of $8–10 billion from shipping, $7–8 billion from fisheries, $10 billion from aquaculture, and $5–6 billion from maritime tourism. Additional income could be realized through renewable ocean energy projects, ship recycling, and by transforming traditional ports into sustainable, environmentally friendly “green ports.”\nJunaid Anwar said globally, the blue economy contributes approximately $1.5 trillion annually, encompassing a wide range of sectors such as fisheries, shipping, tourism, offshore energy, and marine biotechnology, while Pakistan is generating a much smaller share relative to its neighbours.\nJunaid Anwar highlighted the urgent need to address structural and operational challenges of a maritime sector that include fragmented governance structures, outdated port and shipping technologies, marine pollution, lack of research and innovation, and inadequate infrastructure.\n“Our oceans are a national asset, and if managed wisely, they can serve as a key driver for economic growth, job creation, and environmental sustainability,” said the minister. “We are committed to ensuring that the Blue Economy Policy aligns with Pakistan’s Vision 2035 and the Sustainable Development Goals.”\nThe ministry has already begun consultations with leading maritime experts, with a draft policy expected soon. The final document will outline actionable measures, investment strategies, and institutional reforms needed to unleash the full economic power of Pakistan’s maritime sector.\nMinistry of Maritime Affairs invites all stakeholders to participate actively in shaping this important policy, which is set to be a cornerstone of a sustainable economic future and strengthen Pakistan’s approach to managing and growing its ocean-based industries in an economically productive manner.",
