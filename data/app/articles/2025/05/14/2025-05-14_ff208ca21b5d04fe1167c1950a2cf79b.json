India’s actions also contravene its obligations under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, especially Articles 6 and 38, and violate multiple UN Security Council Resolutions, including 1261, 1612, and 1882, aimed at protecting children in armed conflict.\nThese attacks may constitute war crimes under Article 8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.\nWe urge the Government of Pakistan to raise this grave matter at international forums including the UN, UNICEF, OIC and Human Rights Council, and demand accountability for this atrocity, she added.\nThe PCCR stands with the bereaved families and calls on the global community to break its silence. The protection of children is a sacred duty and a moral imperative under international law and human conscience.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
