These assertions could not be independently verified.\n“The Pakistani nation has proven that national defense rests in strong hands,” Ashrafi remarked, commending the armed forces, including the army, air force, and navy, for what he called “discipline, restraint, and professionalism.” Ashrafi asserted that no civilian targets were harmed by Pakistani forces and claimed India had requested a ceasefire due to battlefield setbacks.\nAshrafi thanked Muslim-majority countries including Turkey, Iran, and Azerbaijan for their diplomatic support. Chairman urged the international community, including the United Nations and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), to help resolve longstanding issues like Kashmir.\nThe Chairman PUC welcomed the reported lifting of certain U.S. sanctions on Syria and encouraged the Muslim world to actively engage in resolving the Kashmir dispute.\nAshrafi also warned against any potential Indian move to restrict Pakistan’s water supply, saying, “If India tries to stop our water, we will stop its breath.”\nAshrafi went on to say that Pakistan’s armed forces, including its pilots, had acted with courage and spiritual conviction, and that many were prepared for martyrdom. “Even children in Pakistan are ready to serve in the defense of the country,” he added.\nEmphasizing interfaith unity, Ashrafi praised the contributions of Christian, Hindu, and Sikh communities during times of national crisis. “Non-Muslims are our younger brothers. We are one nation,” he said.\nChairman Ashrafi reiterated that Friday would be observed nationwide as a “Day of Gratitude” in commemoration of what he termed a “battle for truth.”",
