Setting national standards for teacher education has become a vital need of the hour.\nHe added that this responsibility does not lie with any one institution alone, but should be a joint mission of all stakeholders—including federal and provincial governments, the private sector, and educational institutions.\nDr Gilani further stated that HEC will continue to provide strong cooperation and full support to all relevant institutions and stakeholders, including the National Accreditation Council for Teacher Education (NACTE), for the development and improvement of teacher education programs, so that a new era of quality teaching in Pakistan can begin.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Prof Dr Nasir Mahmood, Chairman of the Accreditation Council for Teacher Education, Vice-Chancellor of Allama Iqbal Open University and Rector of Virtual University—said that high-profile teachers, stakeholders, and policymakers are participating in this two-day conference.

Its aim is to improve the standards of professional teacher training and find solutions to the challenges facing the teaching profession.\nEducational experts, policymakers, teachers, researchers, and students from Pakistan and various other countries participated in the conference.\nThe speakers emphasized that teacher training is the foundation of quality education, and highlighted the importance of teacher licensing, modern training models, and research-based teaching.\nInternational experts shed light on successful global education models that can be adopted in Pakistan.
