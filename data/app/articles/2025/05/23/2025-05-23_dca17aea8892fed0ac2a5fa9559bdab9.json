  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 23 (APP):The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Government of Pakistan have partnered to establish 26 new vaccination centers across the country, serving over 750,000 people in underserved areas.\nThe centers, funded by GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance, will provide access to lifesaving vaccines and essential health care services to populations previously lacking access, said in a press release.\nThirteen prefabricated vaccination centers are already operational in Punjab, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan, while the remaining 13 are in the procurement phase and will be built in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe centers are strategically located in areas with limited access to basic health care services and low vaccination coverage.\nThe facilities will be solar-powered to ensure functionality during power cuts and natural disasters, contributing to climate change mitigation.\nThe partnership aims to strengthen Pakistan’s Expanded Programme on Immunization and reach communities most in need.\nWHO Representative in Pakistan, Dr. Dapeng Luo, emphasized the importance of delivering health for all and leaving no one behind. The initiative will help reinforce primary health care and respond to emergencies more effectively.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
