The conventional, one-dimensional study of war, he asserted, is now outdated and no longer applicable.\nThe Chief Guest highlighted that the participation of officers from friendly countries reflects the strong bonds of friendship and mutual trust they share with Pakistan Navy.\nHe expressed hope that these fraternal ties would continue to grow stronger in the years ahead.\nEarlier, the Commandant of Pakistan Navy War College presented an overview of the 45-week-long course, covering various professional and academic activities undertaken by the participants.\nThe ceremony was attended by senior military officers, civil dignitaries, and families of the graduating officers.",
