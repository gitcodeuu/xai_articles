He added that Pakistan had taken swift and effective action in response, successfully shooting down dozens of hostile drones.\nNaqvi held India solely responsible for the deteriorating security situation in the region, stating that New Delhi’s actions had pushed the entire South Asian region to the brink of war.\n“The region is dangerously close to a conflict, and Pakistan will never allow its security to be compromised,” he declared.\nThe meeting also included U.S. Political Counselor Zack Harkinrider, indicating the seriousness with which the U.S. is monitoring the situation.\nThis high-level engagement comes at a critical time as tensions between the two nuclear-armed neighbors continue to rise, raising concerns in the international community about regional stability and peace.",
