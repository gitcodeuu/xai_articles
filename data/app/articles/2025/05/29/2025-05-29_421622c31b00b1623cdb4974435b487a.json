The outcomes of these high-level engagements are expected to open new avenues for regional cooperation, economic growth, and infrastructural advancement.\nSaba Sadiq noted that during the visit to Iran, both countries signed several agreements to enhance bilateral cooperation, particularly in the areas of trade, border markets, security, and energy. Most notably, discussions were held on reviving the long-delayed Iran-Pakistan gas pipeline project, which has the potential to alleviate Pakistan’s chronic energy shortages.\nShe said the expansion of border markets will facilitate local trade and improve livelihoods along the shared border, especially in underdeveloped areas.\nShe further stated that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s meeting with Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi reflected mutual commitment to strengthening economic and political ties. “This is a positive step forward, especially in the current global context, where regional cooperation is key to overcoming economic challenges,” she added.\nRegarding the visit to Azerbaijan, Saba Sadiq highlighted the $2 billion investment agreement as a major breakthrough in Pakistan’s efforts to attract foreign investment. The investment will focus on key sectors such as energy, infrastructure, tourism, and education.\nShe appreciated the Azerbaijani government’s decision to lift import duties on Pakistani Basmati rice, calling it a supportive gesture to strengthen trade ties and boost Pakistan’s agricultural exports.\nAdditionally, the cooperation agreement on the Machike–Thallian–Tarujabba White Oil Pipeline Project, along with planned amendments to the LNG trade framework, will contribute significantly to Pakistan’s energy diversification and long-term supply security. “Energy security is essential for our industrial and economic progress, and Azerbaijan’s support will help bridge critical gaps,” she said.\nSaba Sadiq also mentioned that defense collaboration and technology transfer discussed during the meetings indicate a growing strategic partnership between Pakistan and Azerbaijan. Such cooperation not only strengthens national defense capabilities but also promotes self-reliance and innovation within the country.\n“These visits reflect Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s vision of proactive diplomacy aimed at long-term benefits for the people of Pakistan,” she said. “The agreements and understandings reached during these visits will lay the groundwork for sustainable development, regional stability, and mutual economic prosperity.”\nShe concluded by reaffirming the government’s commitment to turning diplomatic gains into practical outcomes for the people. “With continued follow-up and implementation of these agreements, Pakistan can look forward to a brighter, more stable, and prosperous future,” Saba Sadiq stated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
