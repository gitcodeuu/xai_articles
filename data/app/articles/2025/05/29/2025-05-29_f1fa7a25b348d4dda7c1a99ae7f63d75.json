Pakistan is also host to one of the oldest UN peacekeeping Missions – the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP),” he said.\nThe deputy prime minister said that the recent developments in the region reinforced the need for further strengthening the presence and role of UNMOGIP, along with a just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, in accordance with relevant UN Security Council resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.\n“At a time when the world is facing multifaceted threats, the UN Peacekeeping remains one of the most reliable and cost-effective instruments for maintaining international peace and security.”\nDPM Dar recalled that Pakistan, along with the Republic of Korea, co-hosted the Third United Nations Peacekeeping Ministerial Preparatory Meeting on April 15-16, 2025, in Islamabad, under the theme “Towards a Safer and More Effective Peacekeeping: Use of Technology and Integrated Approach.” The outcomes of the meeting have been instrumental in helping create a new momentum towards achieving this end.\nHe reiterated that Pakistan had been and would continue to uphold its strong commitment towards UN Peacekeeping as a vital tool for a peaceful, stable, and prosperous world.",
