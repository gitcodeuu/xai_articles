  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 29 (APP):Alibek Mukambaev, a distinguished expert on International Development and Senior Administrative Assistant at the Organization for Security Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), on Thursday highlighted ways to boost trade and cooperation between Kyrgyzstan and Pakistan.\nAs part of the Institute of Regional Studies (IRS) Eminent Speaker Series, Mr. Mukambaev highlighted the untapped economic potential between the two countries and proposed strategic initiatives to revitalize bilateral trade, which he noted remains significantly below its potential, said a press release issued here.\nHe also discussed the growing importance of business and cultural connections between the two countries. He pointed out that trade remains low despite strong potential and stressed the need for practical steps to improve it.\nHe emphasized the need to enhance existing trade houses and establish new ones to serve as platforms for sustained commercial engagement. He also pointed to the strategic role of Kashgar—a Chinese city proximate to both nations—as a regional trading hub that can serve to accelerate multilateral business activity.\nA key recommendation from Mr. Mukambaev was for Pakistani businesses to consider Kyrgyzstan as a gateway for expansion into Central Asia, proposing it as a viable alternative to Russia for setting up companies and facilitating broader market access. This, he argued, would not only reduce logistical and regulatory hurdles but also foster greater economic resilience and diversification for Pakistan.\n“Stronger B2B and P2P ties are crucial for transforming historical goodwill into concrete economic outcomes,” he stated, calling for policy-level dialogue, targeted investment, and increased academic exchange to underpin this emerging partnership.\nThe talk was well-received by scholars, diplomats, and industry experts in attendance, sparking a lively Q&A session that underlined growing interest in regional connectivity and South-Central Asia cooperation.\nThe Institute of Regional Studies continues to serve as a vital forum for thought leadership and dialogue on issues critical to Pakistan’s foreign policy and regional engagement.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
