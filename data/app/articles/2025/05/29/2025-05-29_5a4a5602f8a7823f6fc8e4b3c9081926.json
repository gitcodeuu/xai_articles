Citing the 1956 White House summit, led by President Eisenhower, as a milestone in citizen diplomacy, Dr. Iqbal emphasized that the session aimed to unite Pakistani-origin scholars from the Asia-Pacific region to explore how their expertise can strengthen global linkages and positively impact Pakistan’s international engagement.\nNadeem Afzal from IAE Global Pakistan shared his personal journey, from visiting Australia to acquiring professional expertise in student counseling. He emphasized the vital role of parents in guiding students toward the right educational path and in making informed decisions. Highlighting the importance of authenticity and trust, he urged students to seek support from registered and reliable counselors. He also discussed IAE Global’s evolving models, which encourage both students and parents to visit their desired study destination beforehand, recognizing it as a crucial step in one of life’s most important decisions.\nDr. Mehmood Hussain, Assistant Professor at AIOU, emphasized that ambition is key to success and discussed China’s rise, challenging Western perceptions of it as a threat. He stressed to project the localized IR narrative rather than relying on the western led IR discourse.\nHe highlighted China’s unique model of “moral realism,” which integrates ethics into development for a harmonious society. He recommended collaborative projects rooted in shared Chinese and Muslim values, stressing the importance of a three-tier engagement model that involves leaders, academics, businesspeople, and students from both China and abroad.\nDr. Faheem Ahmed, Director of Biologics4U in South Korea, discussed various scholarship opportunities available for students, including professor-associated and government-funded programs. He also highlighted alternative pathways, such as skilled worker visas facilitated through the embassy. He noted the ongoing support from the South Korean embassy, which regularly organizes joint programs between Pakistan and Korea to strengthen educational and professional ties.\nThis was followed by an interactive session featuring not only Pakistani alumni from Asia-Pacific universities but also students from other countries in the region, including Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand. They shared valuable insights from their experiences living in both Pakistan and abroad, offering diverse perspectives on cross-cultural engagement and academic exchange. The session ended with interactive Q/A, followed by recommendations.\nThe session was moderated by Sardar Bakhsh, Joint Secretary, CAPS. He focused on the importance of Asia-Pacific region as at the heart of global economic, technological, and geopolitical transformation and its pivotal role in reshaping the world. Yet, despite our deep cultural, religious, and historical linkages with several countries in the Asia-Pacific region, Pakistan’s presence in this strategic landscape remains under explored.\nThe session was concluded by Umair Parvez, General Secretary of CAPS, who summarized the key points discussed and emphasized the need for more Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) with countries in the Asia-Pacific region. He highlighted that individual efforts play a crucial role in bridging gaps between nations and projecting a positive image of Pakistan globally.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
