Leaving even one child unvaccinated puts entire communities at risk.”\nThe programme continues to urge parents and communities to ensure no child is missed, reinforcing the message that protecting children from polio is a shared national responsibility.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
