  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 6 (APP):Federal Minister for Climate Change and Environmental Coordination Musadik Malik on Thursday said that Parliament is the appropriate forum for meaningful debate on national security and unity.\nTalking to a private news channel, he said that both Senate and National Assembly unanimously passed resolutions condemning Indian aggression and firmly rejecting the allegations made against Pakistan.\nHe further said that the Assembly condemned India’s baseless propaganda and also reiterated Pakistan’s firm support for the people of Kashmir and their right to self-determination.\nCommenting on the opposition’s suggestion of an All Parties Conference (APC), he remarked, “if the intention is genuine solidarity, it should not be linked to the presence or absence of any individual. That’s politics, not unity.”\n“If unity is the objective, then this is the right forum,” Malik said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
