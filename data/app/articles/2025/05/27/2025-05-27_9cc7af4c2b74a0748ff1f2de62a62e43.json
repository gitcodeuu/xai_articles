This day serves as a reminder of our commitment to safeguarding the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of our beloved country.”\nThe president underscored that the nation on this day pay rich tribute to the scientists, engineers, and civil and military leadership, whose dedication and commitment made this achievement possible.\n“We also pay tribute to Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who laid the foundation of Pakistan’s nuclear programme, which made the country’s defence impregnable.
