  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 21 (APP):The Islamabad’s district administration has started planning ahead of Eid-ul-Azha to manage cattle markets and prevent illegal animal trading in the federal capital.\nIn this regard, Deputy Commissioner (DC) Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon chaired a meeting to review the arrangements. The session was attended by assistant commissioners and the Director of the Metropolitan Corporation (DMA).\nDuring the meeting, officials were briefed on the locations where cattle markets will be allowed. According to the plan, five designated spots across the federal capital will host animal markets this year.\nMarkets will be established in Sangjhani, Sector I-15, and Bhara Kahu. Two additional markets will be set up along Lehtrar Road and Islamabad Expressway. These venues have been selected to manage the flow of people and livestock more efficiently, and to minimize disruption in residential areas.\nThe briefing further outlined that no trading of animals will be allowed outside these official markets. The district administration has decided to strictly enforce this rule to maintain order and hygiene in the city during the days leading up to Eid.\nDeputy Commissioner Irfan Nawaz Memon directed authorities to prepare for a city-wide crackdown on illegal cattle markets. He said any unapproved trading spots that emerge in local neighborhoods or along roadsides will be removed without delay.\nHe emphasized that only authorized markets will be allowed to operate and instructed the assistant commissioners to remain active in their respective areas to monitor the situation.\nThe district administration also plans to issue clear instructions to vendors and buyers regarding health, sanitation, and traffic management near these markets. Special teams will be deployed to manage waste and ensure cleanliness during the peak trading days.\nApart from administrative measures, coordination with the police and municipal authorities will be enhanced to regulate traffic around market areas and maintain law and order. Emergency services and medical teams will also be placed on standby to deal with any incidents.\nThis year, the district administration is focusing on limiting the spread of cattle trading into urban areas, especially to prevent health risks and inconvenience to residents. Officials say previous years have shown that unregulated markets create problems ranging from traffic jams to waste disposal issues.\nBy limiting trading to designated areas, the administration aims to make the process more organized and easier to manage for both sellers and buyers.\nDeputy Commissioner Memon instructed the DMA and assistant commissioners to finalize preparations and submit detailed plans for each market location. He added that field inspections will begin soon to check whether the designated sites meet the required conditions.\nSpecial attention will be paid to water availability, shade arrangements for animals, and waste management systems at the approved market sites. Veterinary services will also be available to check the health of the animals before and during trading.\nThe administration plans to run public awareness campaigns before the markets open, informing residents about the approved locations and encouraging them to avoid buying animals from unverified sellers.\nTo further support the effort, security personnel will be deployed around all official markets. Surveillance systems, including CCTV cameras, may also be installed to monitor large gatherings and deter any criminal activity.\nIn addition to the operational aspects, the meeting also discussed coordination with the Capital Development Authority (CDA), sanitation staff, and emergency responders. All departments have been directed to keep their teams on high alert during Eid days.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
