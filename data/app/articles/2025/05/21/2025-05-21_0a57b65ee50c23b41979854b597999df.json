Of the more than 63 million children aged 5 to 16, only 42 percent are enrolled in public schools, while 32 percent remain out of school, and 26 percent are in private or informal institutions.\nMs. Qamar called for urgent investment, innovative reforms, and equitable access to quality education, particularly in underserved communities.\n“We must move beyond short-term solutions,” she said. “Pakistan needs enduring partnerships to create an education system that meets the challenges of today and the opportunities of tomorrow.”\nDr. Ghulam Ali Mallah provided an in-depth overview of Pakistan’s diverse educational landscape.\nHe shared that approximately 8 to 9 million students appear annually in board examinations for grades 9 to 12, with increasing interest in international qualifications from British, Swiss, and American boards operating in Pakistan.\nHe underscored the critical role of IBCC in regulating and equating these qualifications and introduced the launch of a new online portal to streamline the credential evaluation process and enhance engagement with global partners.\n“Pakistan must not be seen only as a recipient of services,” Dr. Mallah stated. “We are ready to act as a global partner in innovation and educational development. We welcome institutions from the UK and beyond to join us in co-creating transformative learning solutions.”\nThe event featured other notable speakers including Lord Jo Johnson, Member of the House of Lords, UK; Ms. Kirstie Donnelly, CEO of City & Guilds UK; Ms. Gulmina Bilal, Chairperson of NAVTTC Islamabad; and Dr. Amir Saadati, Executive Director of GEMS Middle East. Senior officials from the High Commission for Pakistan in the UK, Vice Chancellors, and renowned educationists also participated in the event.\nThe reception concluded with a shared commitment to promoting inclusive, technology-integrated, and globally benchmarked education systems.\nThe delegates echoed the message that education must be treated not only as a national priority but as a collective global mission to empower future generations.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
