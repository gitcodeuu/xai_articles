  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 21 (APP):Parliamentary Secretary Sheikh Saad Waseem has said that the government’s initiatives have led to a significant reduction in tax evasion and a major expansion in the tax net.\nSpeaking during the question hour in the National Assembly on Wednesday, he informed the house that since 2022, around 8 million individuals have been brought into the tax net due to various government measures.\nResponding to a question from Shazia Soomro, Sheikh Saad stated that although exact figures of reduced tax evasion cannot be disclosed at this time, the trend has shown a noticeable decline. He emphasized that the government is not interested in controversial moves like blocking mobile SIMs but is focused on increasing tax compliance through effective strategies.\nAnswering a query from Khawaja Izhar, the parliamentary secretary noted that 458,342 individuals entered the tax net recently, and 276,000 people filed tax returns this year alone. From 2022 to 2025, the number of taxpayers has risen by 8 million, with 3.1 million new taxpayers added just this year.\nSheikh Saad reiterated the government’s commitment to expanding the tax base as a means of strengthening the economy and improving public services.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
