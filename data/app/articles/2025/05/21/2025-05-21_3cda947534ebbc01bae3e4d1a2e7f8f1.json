The other members of the bench included Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan, Justice Salahuddin Panhwar, and Justice Shakeel Ahmed.\nDuring the proceedings, Advocate Idrees Ashraf, representing the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), continued his arguments. At one point, Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan asked the counsel to read paragraph 4 of the petition, questioning, “What have you written? Has any political leader in the country’s history ever filed such a petition?”\nJustice Muhammad Ali Mazhar remarked that the content of the petition was embarrassing for the High Court judges. Justice Shahid Bilal Hassan further commented, “My inclination is to dismiss the petition with a fine.”\nJustice Mazhar noted that in the past, judicial transfers had a set duration, but this condition was removed through the 18th Constitutional Amendment. He added that under the current system, judicial appointments fall under the jurisdiction of the Judicial Commission.\n“If such words were used about me, I would have felt ashamed too,” Justice Mazhar said, referring to the content of the petition.\nAdvocate Idrees Ashraf withdrew the petition, stating that senior lawyer Shoaib Shaheen is representing Founder PTI in a separate petition. “I filed the petition on behalf of Raja Muqsit, and such language was not used in it,” he clarified.\nFollowing Ashraf’s arguments, Advocate Faisal Siddiqi, representing the Karachi Bar Association, began presenting his case. Justice Mazhar observed that the two transferred judges were the most junior on the seniority list.\nThe constitutional bench then adjourned further proceedings until Friday, May 23, when Advocate Faisal Siddiqi will resume his arguments.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
