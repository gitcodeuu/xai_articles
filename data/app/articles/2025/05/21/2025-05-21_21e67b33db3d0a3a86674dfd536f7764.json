  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 21 (APP): Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar on Wednesday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to defeating terrorism and said India’s proxies would be defeated from Pakistan’s soil.\nSpeaking in the National Assembly, the minister strongly condemned the terrorist attack on a school bus in Khuzdar, Balochistan, calling it a cowardly act by enemies who have failed to confront Pakistan in traditional warfare.\n“This morning, a school bus was deliberately targeted in Khuzdar. Innocent children were attacked. It is a day of national mourning,” he said.\nTarar said India was supporting terrorism in Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa through Fitna al-Khawarij.\nHe said, “These are enemies who do not know our history. When the time comes to sacrifice, even the sacrifices of our children are worthy of being written in golden words.”\nHe praised Pakistan’s armed forces for their courage and resilience in defending the nation. “Thanks to Allah, our forces have always defeated the enemy with bravery. But today’s attack on schoolchildren shows how desperate our enemies have become,” he added.\nThe minister said that after losing in direct combat, the enemy was now using proxy warfare to destabilize the country. “They lack the courage to face us openly. Under the leadership of Field Marshal Syed Asim Munir , our forces have shown dominance. Having failed on the battlefield, the enemy is now trying to create unrest in Balochistan and KP through terrorist groups,” he said.\nHe assured the House that these attacks would not weaken the nation’s resolve. “Our unity is our strength. These foreign-funded terrorists cannot match our willpower. We have previously taken down enemy airbases, missiles, and plans.”\nTarar said the attack on schoolchildren has been condemned by the House. “We will not rest until every terrorist is punished. Investigations are ongoing, and those behind this attack will be brought to justice.”\nHe also prayed for the early recovery of the injured children, some of whom are in critical condition. “May Allah grant them a quick recovery. Our resolve stands firm—India’s proxies will be defeated, and terrorism will be completely wiped out,” he added.",
