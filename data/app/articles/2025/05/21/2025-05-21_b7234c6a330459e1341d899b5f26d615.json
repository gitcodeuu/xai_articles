This will be negotiated by an Intergovernmental Working Group and considered at the next Assembly.\nOnce the PABS annex is adopted, the full agreement will be open for signature and ratification. It will enter into force after 60 ratifications.\nThe establishment of support mechanisms  included the Coordinating Financial Mechanism and the Global Supply Chain and Logistics Network (GSCL) to remove barriers to pandemic response tools.\nPharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the PABS system will provide the WHO with rapid access to 20% of their real-time production of vaccines and other critical products, ensuring availability based on public health risk and need.\nThis is only the second international legal agreement negotiated under Article 19 of the WHO Constitution, following the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control adopted in 2003.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
