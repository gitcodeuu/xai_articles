He described Iqbal as a poet of love and peace, a visionary who offered new hope to the Islamic world and aimed to unite the Ummah through his message. The Ambassador highlighted Iqbal’s deep spiritual ties with Iran and stressed that the Muslim world should recognise its own strengths rather than emulating the West.\nRector NUML, Major General (Retd.) Shahid Mahmood Kayani, HI(M), in his remarks urged the youth to draw inspiration from Iqbal’s life and teachings. He emphasised that the future of Pakistan rests on the shoulders of its younger generation, who must prepare themselves for leadership through character, wisdom, and a strong moral foundation rooted in the Quran. He encouraged students to read Kulliyat-e-Iqbal to gain guidance for personal and national development.\nThe concluding session of the one-day 3rd National Commemoration Conference on Allama Iqbal was held at Iqbal Hall.\nSharifzoda Yusuf, Ambassador of Tajikistan to Pakistan and a proud alumnus of NUML’s English Department, graced the event as Chief Guest. In his address, Ambassador Yusuf paid glowing tribute to Allama Iqbal, lauding his intellectual contributions to the Muslim world.\nHe shared that Iqbal Day is celebrated with reverence in Tajikistan and called for a deeper engagement with Kulliyat-e-Iqbal to truly understand Iqbal’s vision. He noted that Iqbal’s poetry continues to inspire writers and thinkers in Tajikistan.\nThe Ambassador also expressed his firm resolve to further strengthen bilateral relations with Pakistan and reiterated Tajikistan’s unwavering support for Pakistan, even in challenging times.\nIn his concluding remarks, Director General NUML, Brig (R) Shahzad Munir, appreciated the efforts of the organisers in successfully hosting the conference. He emphasised that Allama Iqbal is a rare intellectual asset whose legacy transcends borders.\nBrig Munir urged students to read and reflect on Iqbal’s poetry, which continues to offer guidance and inspiration to the youth.\nThe event concluded with an award ceremony to honour winners of the Allama Iqbal Photography Competition, celebrating creative interpretations of Iqbal’s message.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
