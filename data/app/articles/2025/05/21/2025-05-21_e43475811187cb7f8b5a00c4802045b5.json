He applauded China’s poverty alleviation achievements, calling them an inspiration for developing nations.\nReiterating Pakistan’s commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Syedaal Khan pointed to national programs like the Benazir Income Support Program (BISP), youth empowerment schemes, and universal health coverage, which aim to ensure inclusive and sustainable growth.\nHe emphasized agriculture as a key sector for mutual cooperation, particularly for its role in food security and rural employment. He welcomed future collaboration under CPEC and the Silk Road Expo in areas such as smart agriculture, advanced irrigation systems, seed development, and agricultural processing.\nThe Deputy Chairman lauded China’s training of 1,000 Pakistani agricultural professionals, noting that the first group of 300 experts is already receiving training in China. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s eagerness to modernize its agricultural sector through deeper cooperation.\nHe also called for stronger cultural and educational exchanges, enhanced business-to-business linkages, and increased investment in Special Economic Zones (SEZs), emphasizing that such initiatives would pave new pathways for shared development.\nIn his concluding remarks, he said, “Let us continue building corridors of peace, prosperity, and inclusive development. Under the banner of regional solidarity and mutual respect, let us move forward together toward a shared future where progress becomes a collective legacy.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
