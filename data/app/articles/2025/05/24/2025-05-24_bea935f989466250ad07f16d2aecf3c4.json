Turkish cuisine is known not only for its variety and deep flavors but also as a reflection of our cultural heritage, rooted in sharing and togetherness.”\nThis year’s theme focuses on ‘Classic Dishes’, the traditional backbone of Turkish cooking. Guests were treated to a variety of home-made Turkish specialties, with recipe booklets placed on the tables for those wishing to recreate the dishes at home.\nAmong the evening’s highlights was traditional Turkish coffee, prepared in hot sand, offering guests a taste of an authentic culinary experience.\nThe ambassador noted the strong enthusiasm for Turkish cuisine among the people of Pakistan, especially those who have visited Turkiye. “In Turkiye, meals are more than food, they are occasions of connection, warmth, and community,” he said. “Sharing is the key word.”\nSpeaking on the enduring bond between the two nations, Ambassador Neziroglu emphasized the ‘eternal brotherhood’ that defines Turkiye-Pakistan relations.\n“The fraternal ties between Turkiye and Pakistan are unique, granted to very few nations in the world,” he remarked. “We take pride in each other’s successes and share in each other’s sorrows. In Pakistan, we never feel like foreigners. I am sincerely grateful to the people of Pakistan – from ordinary citizens to the highest levels of leadership – for embracing me as a brother.”\nHe expressed confidence in the growing cooperation between the two countries in diverse fields including trade, tourism, culture, media, higher education, judiciary, and parliamentary relations.\nSpecial appreciation was extended to the ambassador’s wife, Amine, and her team for organizing the event. “Even yesterday, she was praying for morning rain and afternoon sunshine, and Allah accepted her dua,” he said with a smile, adding humorously, “As for the storm, I suspect someone else made that prayer.”\nThe Deputy Head of Mission, Mr. Berk, and his team of young diplomats were also acknowledged for guiding guests through the culinary journey and offering insights into Turkish flavors.\nThe evening concluded with heartfelt slogans of “Turkiye-Pakistan Dosti Zindabad” and “Turkiye-Pakistan cuisine Paindabad” echoing the spirit of friendship and flavor.",
