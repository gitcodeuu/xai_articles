These individuals were part of an agent mafia that promised people quick passport services in exchange for money.\nAccording to the FIA spokesperson, the operation was carried out in and around the passport office after reports of illegal activity. The arrested agents were taking advantage of people who were unaware of the official process and charging them extra money.\nThe agents arrested during the raid include Mohsin Shehzad, Sajjad Ali, Muhammad Ali, Muhammad Afzal, Hafiz Usama Akhtar, Mehr Ali Hassan, and Muhammad Imran Siddiqui. Others arrested include Faisal Mushtaq, Babar Akram, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Tariq, Abdullah Saeed, Muhammad Asad Bhatti, and Muhammad Younas.

Officials have said that more arrests are expected in the coming days.\nThe FIA has urged citizens to avoid dealing with agents and to follow the official procedure for passport applications.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
