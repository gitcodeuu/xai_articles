Such actions are in contravention of the UN Charter, international law, and established norms governing inter-state relations. Pakistan firmly rejected India’s baseless justifications for its hostile conduct,” the spokesperson added.\nThe Indian side was also warned that such reckless behavior posed a serious threat to regional peace and stability.",
