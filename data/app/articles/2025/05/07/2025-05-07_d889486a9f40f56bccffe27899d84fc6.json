Our nation is awake and ready to respond.”\nHe lauded the resolute and effective response of the Pakistan Armed Forces and specially the Pakistan Air Force that thwarted the enemy’s intentions. “I salute our brave forces for protecting the country and giving a strong response,” he said.\n“India has turned into a terrorist and religiously extremist state,” he said, adding that it had attacked mosques and civilian populations inside Pakistan on Tuesday night.\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Barrister Gohar Ali Khan said the entire nation standing together as one united voice in defense of country’s sovereignty.\nHe lauded the Pakistan’s Armed Forces for making the defense of the homeland impregnable.\nGohar condemned the cowardly attacks carried out by Indian forces last night, which targeted mosques and civilians. “Our coward enemy will get a response that will be remembered for centuries,” he added.\nHe especially praised the Pakistan Air Force for downing Indian aircraft during the overnight confrontation. He reaffirmed Pakistan’s right to defend itself and respond to aggression.\nPakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Zartaj Gul condemning the cowardly Indian attack, said that our enemy carried out attacks under the cover of darkness, and targeted the civilians.\nShe said that this was not an attack on any political party rather, this was an attack on Pakistan.\nShe said, “We must tell the world that India attacked our homeland.

Over 80,000 Pakistanis have lost their lives while fighting against terrorism.\nThe country stands united behind its brave forces and lauded them for their befitting response to Indian cowardly attacks.\nZartaj Gul called for calling an All Parties Conference (APC) for the national unity.\nJamiat Ulema Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) lawmaker, Abdul Ghafoor Haidari strongly condemned last night’s unprovoked attack by India, and called it an “unpardonable crime”.\nHe lauded country’s braved armed forces for their swift and effective response, including the downing of Indian aircraft and drones.\nHaidari lauded the brave Armed Forces of Pakistan and warned India against further provocations. “You started this misadventure; we reserve the right to retaliate,” he said.\nHe said Narendra Modi “Butcher of Gujarat” is a murderer and terrorist.
