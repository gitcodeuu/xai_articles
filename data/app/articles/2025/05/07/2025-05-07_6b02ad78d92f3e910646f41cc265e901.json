Pakistan would be happy if Qatar were to join this effort. However, India had chosen the dangerous path of aggression, which demonstrated its irresponsible State behaviour, and aversion to peace in the region.\nThe Prime Minister of Qatar expressed condolences for the loss of precious lives and appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to fostering peace in South Asia.",
