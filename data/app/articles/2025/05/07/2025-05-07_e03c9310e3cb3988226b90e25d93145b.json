The white in our flag is not ornamental—it is our pride,” he said, citing recent nationwide celebrations of Holi, Easter, and other religious festivals as testimony to Pakistan’s inclusive ethos.\nDas commended Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, and Army Chief General Asim Munir for their decisive response to the Indian attack. “The world has seen the true face of Modi’s Hindutva regime—fascist and driven by Islamophobia,” he added, underscoring that Pakistan’s strength lies in its pluralistic identity and peaceful intentions.\nEchoing this sentiment, Punjab’s Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Ramesh Singh Arora, stated, “We unanimously condemn the brutal Indian aggression. Peace cannot coexist with violence.” Highlighting the Kartarpur Corridor as a beacon of interfaith goodwill, he emphasized that Pakistan’s Sikh community, along with the global Sikh diaspora, stands united with the nation.\nArora also drew attention to Pakistan’s consistent efforts to foster peace, despite provocation. “Recent attacks may seek to provoke war, but Pakistan remains firm in its vision of tolerance, unity, and respect,” he concluded, calling on the international community to recognize the destabilizing consequences of unchecked aggression.\nFederal Minister for Investment and Board of Investment (BOI) Chairman Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh, stated that India’s hostile attitude and efforts to isolate Pakistan globally have always posed obstacles to Pakistan’s economic growth. However, he emphasized our commitment to lift Pakistan out of this predicament. “Investment is our mission, and there is a pressing need to invest in information technology and skill development to foster economic prosperity.” He highlighted that there are numerous opportunities in West and Central Asia that still need to be explored and acted upon.\nKelly Johnson, from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the U.S., stated that the IRS Regional Dialogue, which aimed to explore pathways to peace and prosperity, was a significant conference.
