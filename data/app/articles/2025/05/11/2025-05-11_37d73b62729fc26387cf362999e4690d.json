He added that there is no substitute for the pure and sacred bond like that of a mother.\nMohsin Naqvi further stated that the most beautiful moments spent in a mother’s lap can never be found even on the most luxurious bed in the world, and a mother’s prayers can elevate a person from the ground to the skies. He said, “Whatever position I hold today, it is solely due to the prayers of my respected mother. I firmly believe that the prayers of my late mother are still with me.”\nThe Interior Minister saluted the greatness of all mothers and also paid tribute to the mothers of martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country. In the end, he offered a heartfelt prayer that May Allah keep every mother safe and blessed.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
