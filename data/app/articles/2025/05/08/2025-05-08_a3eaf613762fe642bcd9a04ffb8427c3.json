She said that India is using social media to spread false stories and that a cyber war is underway.\nShe stressed that in modern warfare, controlling the narrative can be more damaging than traditional attacks.\nThe chairperson emphasised the importance of national unity and social harmony to counter this form of hybrid warfare.\nCommittee members showed their support for the armed forces and condemned India’s targeting of civilians.\nThey agreed that the country is facing a serious situation that requires national unity, patriotism, and resilience.\nThe committee recommended that the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) start a public awareness campaign to educate people about cyber threats and the need to stay united.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
