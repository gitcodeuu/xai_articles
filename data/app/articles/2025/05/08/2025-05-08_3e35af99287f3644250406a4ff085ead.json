  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 08 (APP):The Supreme Court’s constitutional bench has referred the contempt of court case against the founder of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to a regular bench.\nThe case was heard on Thursday by a five-member constitutional bench headed by Justice Amin-ud-Din Khan.\nDuring the hearing, Justice Jamal Khan Mandokhail questioned whether the case should be handled by their bench or if it falls under the jurisdiction of a regular bench.\nAdvocate Salman Akram Raja, representing the PTI founder, responded that the matter did not involve any constitutional questions and therefore should be referred to a regular bench.\nThe Additional Attorney General supported this stance, noting that in a previous case involving reserved seats, the court had similarly sent the contempt matter to a regular bench.\nSubsequently, the constitutional bench accepted the arguments and formally referred the contempt of court case against the PTI founder to a regular bench for further proceedings.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
