The initiative supports both national and global efforts to tackle the triple burden of malnutrition while fostering sustainable, resilient, and equitable food environments.\nIn her opening remarks, Ms Farah Naz,Country Director of GAIN Pakistan, emphasized the essential role of faculty members in shaping a future-ready food workforce and reaffirmed GAIN’s dedication to supporting transformative change within the education sector.\nFaiz Rasool, Head of Policy and Advocacy at GAIN Pakistan, highlighted the pressing issue of malnutrition in the country, particularly as it relates to food insecurity and the growing impact of climate change. He emphasized the importance of equipping youth with relevant food systems knowledge and using that foundation to inform future policy and program development. He further underlined the need to build faculty capacity as a critical enabler of systems transformation—an area this GAIN initiative specifically targets.\nDuring the workshop, participants explored curriculum design for food systems education, effective assessment and evaluation strategies, experiential and participatory learning methods, and the integration of digital tools in classroom instruction. These sessions were designed not only to strengthen pedagogical approaches but also to encourage institutional collaboration, curriculum innovation, and active engagement with local policy contexts.\nThis workshop marks a pivotal step toward institutionalizing food systems education within Pakistan’s higher education sector. It lays the groundwork for continued academic engagement, capacity strengthening, and knowledge co-creation, ultimately supporting a more nutrition-secure and sustainable future for the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
