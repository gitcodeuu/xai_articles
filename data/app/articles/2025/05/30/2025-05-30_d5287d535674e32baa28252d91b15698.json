Their work inspires new paths forward for civil society and the world.”\nHira Amjad, Founder and Executive Director of DASTAK Foundation, expressed gratitude, saying: “This award recognizes the power of care, community, and grassroots knowledge in our work. It affirms that decolonized, gender-responsive climate action is not only necessary but effective and urgent. This moment belongs to every climate defender and survivor building liberation with love.”\nPresented by CIVICUS, the Nelson Mandela-Graça Machel Innovation Awards honor individuals and organizations using innovative approaches to tackle pressing global challenges.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
