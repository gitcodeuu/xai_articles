He highlighted that India targeted innocent children under the cover of night, and tragically, the first martyr of the conflict was the younger son of a Pakistani soldier. Abdul Aleem Khan further said that Pakistan’s military leadership, under the command of Field Marshal Hafiz Syed Asim Munir, led the way by offering the Fajr prayer and raising the battle cry of “Allahu Akbar” before delivering a resounding response to Indian Prime Minister Modi—one that, he said, would be remembered for generations. He added that India’s administration has now been forced to apologize before the world, and its arrogance has been thoroughly shattered. Abdul Aleem Khan extended heartfelt congratulations to Field Marshal Asim Munir, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee General Sahir Shamshad Mirza, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmad Babar Sidhu, and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf for making the entire nation proud. He revealed that the Pakistan Air Force downed six enemy aircraft within an hour and a half, inside enemy territory. He praised the Armed Forces for their collective bravery, stating that the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Air Force risked everything for the nation. He emphasized that the people of Pakistan stand united with their military and will defend the country together against any threat. Abdul Aleem Khan also remarked that Pakistan’s show of strength has had such a significant impact that even the market price of Rafale jets has declined. He expressed gratitude to friendly nations including China, Türkiye, and Azerbaijan for their unwavering support during the conflict. Concluding his remarks, he stated that Pakistan’s military commander is not just a leader for Pakistan but for the entire Islamic world. He added, “We have sent a message to Israel as well — we are not Palestine; we are Pakistan.” Central president of IPP, Abdul Aleem Khan, received a grand welcome in Khushab, where he was honored with a traditional Punjabi turban. The event featured fireworks and a showering of rose petals as a mark of respect and celebration.\nAbdul Aleem Khan declared that on May 10, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s arrogance, pride on military might and wealth was crushed badly while Pakistan brought down the enemy’s “Rafales” jets down their own soil. By the grace of Allah Almighty, our brave and valiant Armed Forces turned the tide within one and a half hour. He added that the entire nation felt immense pride and pleasure. Abdul Aleem Khan emphasized that the entire nation stands united and resolute. “Today, due to the leadership of our Army Chief, Field Marshal Hafiz Syed Asim Munir, no one dares to look at Pakistan with hostility,” he added. He further asserted that Pakistan, as a Nuclear Power, has fought the battle for the entire Muslim Ummah. “Had we not been a nuclear state, and had our armed forces not been so fearless then we might have suffered the same fate as Gaza,” he said. Thanking the people of Khushab, Abdul Aleem Khan reiterated that the Istehkam-e-Pakistan Party stands shoulder to shoulder with the Pakistan Armed Forces in every corner of the country. “We held our first convention at Layyah and now after Khushab, we will continue this journey in Kamoke, Gujranwala, and Faisalabad. Through the platform of IPP, the resilient people of Pakistan will express their solidarity with our Armed Forces and salute our martyrs and veterans,” he remarked.
