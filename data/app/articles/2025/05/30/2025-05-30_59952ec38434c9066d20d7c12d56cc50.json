  "content": "HONG KONG, May 30 (APP):Pakistan’s Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar on Friday hailed the Chinese leadership at the signing ceremony of the Convention establishing the International Organization for Mediation (IOMed) in Hong Kong for ushering a new era of diplomacy.\nAddressing the landmark event hosted by the People’s Republic of China, the deputy prime minister praised Beijing for spearheading the creation of the IOMed, describing it as a “testament to Chinese wisdom” and a reflection of China’s continued commitment to global peace and multilateral diplomacy.\n“This signing ceremony marks not only the birth of a vital global institution dedicated to mediation and conflict resolution but also heralds a new era in international diplomacy,” Dar stated.\nHe likened the establishment of IOMed to China’s earlier groundbreaking initiative—the creation of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB)—calling it an “exceptional step in the world of mediation, as AIIB was in the world of finance.”\nThe Deputy Prime Minister lauded the selection of Hong Kong as the organization’s headquarters, calling it a “super-connector” where East meets West. He described the dynamic city as well-poised to steer the organization through a “transformational journey” in global conflict resolution.\nPakistan, Dar announced, is proud to be among the founding members of the IOMed. He highlighted Pakistan’s own progress in the field with the establishment of the International Mediation and Arbitration Centre (IMAC), aimed at enhancing judicial efficiency and promoting commercial dispute resolution. “We look forward to close collaboration between IOMed and IMAC,” he said.\nDar emphasized the need for adherence to the principles of the UN Charter and international law, warning against the rise of populism, ultra-nationalism, and unilateralism. “We are witnessing the erosion of international norms, with some states disregarding diplomacy and the rule of law in pursuit of narrow regional ambitions,” he said.\nReferring to regional conflicts, Dar spotlighted the unresolved Jammu and Kashmir dispute and the plight of Palestinians under occupation, labeling both as critical threats to regional and global peace. He strongly condemned what he termed as “unprovoked and unjustified military aggression” by Pakistan’s eastern neighbour, including violations of the Indus Waters Treaty and international human rights law.\n“These actions set dangerous precedents and undermine global peace efforts. But the creation of IOMed sends a clear message: the international community does not accept violations of the UN Charter or arbitrary use of force as normal behavior,” he asserted.\nDar also endorsed Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Global Security Initiative (GSI), citing its focus on dialogue, sovereignty, and cooperative security as reflective of the values underpinning IOMed.\nAs a close strategic partner of China, Dar said Pakistan remains fully committed to multilateralism and the principles of peaceful coexistence. “Our presence here is not only symbolic of our support but a reaffirmation of our commitment to justice, equity, and dialogue,” he concluded. “Pakistan will remain an active voice in this noble mission and will support IOMed in fulfilling its potential in the service of peace.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
