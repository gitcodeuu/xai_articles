You have not only defended our skies, but also upheld Pakistan’s honour on the global stage.”\nThe prime minister was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Muhammad Ishaq Dar, Minister for Defence Khawaja Asif, Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu, Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf, Minister for Planning Ahsan Iqbal and Minister for Information and Broadcasting Attaullah Tarar, along with other senior civil and military officials.\nHe said from May 6 to May 10, during the war with India the whole world was astounded by the professional capabilities of the armed forces and the enemy was taken aback with the response of Pakistan.\nThe confidence of the world especially of our friends enhanced in Pakistan after the way it responded to the Indian aggression, he noted.\nHe said it was the most magnificent victory which changed thinking of the world and altered the balance of power in the region.\nPeople of Pakistan were proud of the performance of the armed forces and their heads were high with pride, he added.\nHe said a clear message was sent to the enemy that it should refrain from casting an evil eyes towards Pakistan.\nHe congratulated the chief of army staff, air chief and naval chief on the brilliant performance of the armed forces.\nThe whole world acknowledged that Pakistan won the war with the home grown technology and professional expertise of the armed forces, he added.\nShehbaz Sharif said the eagles of the armed forces shot down six planes of the enemy, adding, “Our armed forces defeated an enemy which was bigger in terms of population and it had in recent years bought hundreds of billions of dollars worth of military equipment.”\nHe said Pakistan crushed the false vanity of the enemy.\n“During the short war, in just few hours, the armed forces with the courage, bravery and valour changed the course of history for all times to come,” he asserted.\nHe said the whole world was looking at the flag of Pakistan with respect.\nThe whole nation was united and praying for the success of the armed forces and the country, he said adding the way the air forces shot down enemy’s Rafale planes, the world would remember the spectacle for eternity.\nWhile quoting Quranic verses, he said the JF Thunder plane shot down India’s Rafale plane which brought back memories of the legends of Pakistan air force like M.M Alam, Cecil Chaudhry and Sarfraz Rafiqui, who demonstrated exceptional brilliance in a previous war against India.\n“In the wake of unprovoked aggression, Pakistan’s Armed Forces exhibited exemplary restraint, strategic foresight, and operational precision.
