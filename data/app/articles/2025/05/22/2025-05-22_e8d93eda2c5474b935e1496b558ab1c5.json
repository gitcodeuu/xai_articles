She particularly lauded the focus on digital payment systems, nutrition, and female education.\n“I am truly impressed to see that we have forged a partnership that supports communities not only during times of stability but also in the face of adversity,” Ms. Bjerde remarked. “BISP’s effective response during the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2022 floods demonstrates its resilience. Experience shows that investing in women, especially female-headed households, leads to better outcomes for entire communities.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
