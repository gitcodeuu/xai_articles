  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 22 (APP)::In recent years, Pakistan has witnessed a growing number of female students stepping into academic fields that were once considered male territory, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Science, Data Analytics, Business, and others. This shift reflects a broader change in societal attitudes, as more young women defy stereotypes and pursue careers in technology and innovation. Data from institutions such as the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS) highlights this encouraging trend, with a 40% increase in female enrollment in computer science programmes between 2018 and 2023.\nThe National Incubation Centers (NICs) have also played a role in promoting inclusivity, reporting that 30% of startups they incubated are now women-led. These centers require at least 25% of their founders to be female, fostering a supportive environment for women entrepreneurs and helping bridge the gender gap in the tech startup space.\nTo explore this transformation more closely, female students from universities across Pakistan shared their motivations for entering fields like AI, cybersecurity, and data science. Bakhtawar Malik, a Software Engineering graduate from Mirpur University of Science and Technology, talking to APP revealed that her decision to pursue tech was driven by a mix of passion and defiance. “People didn’t take me seriously, and I wanted to prove them wrong,” she said with a strong note of confidence.\nAnother student Samra Batool, a student of Data Analytics in COMSATS University echoed same sentiments, stating that the desire to challenge traditional thinking and expectations was a major reason for choosing her field.\nAlishba Haider, a student of Artificial Intelligence at the same university, pointed to societal changes that are supporting this shift. “Previously, girls were pushed toward more conventional degree programs. Now, many are choosing tech fields because the job market has improved, and families are becoming more supportive,” she said. Alishba added that the emergence of role models, new protective laws, and better opportunities have helped build confidence among young women.\nMale students also acknowledge the importance of increasing female representation. Uzzam Arif, a cybersecurity student at FAST University, emphasized the need for early exposure and supportive networks. “We need to highlight successful female role models and introduce tech concepts at the school level. Mentorship programmes and women-focused networking groups can also make a big difference,” he noted.\nEducators believe that institutions have a crucial role to play in encouraging this shift. Mr. Kamran Qureshi, a professor at Askaria College Rawalpindi, advises students to explore tech through internships, workshops, or online courses. “AI and related fields are vast. Whether you’re interested in creativity, problem-solving, or analysis, there’s something for everyone. Don’t let stereotypes or self-doubt stop you,” he advised while encouraging the female students.\nMiss Asma Ahmed, a faculty member at Islamic Asian College of Commerce, in response to an APP’s query highlighted practical steps universities can take. “Offering interdisciplinary programs, hands-on research opportunities, and building strong industry partnerships are key to attracting more women into AI and tech,” she explained.\nGlobally, countries that have actively worked to close gender gaps in STEM fields are witnessing transformative results. For instance, in the United States, women now make up nearly 45% of the workforce in science and engineering occupations at the bachelor’s level, according to the National Science Foundation (2023). Scandinavian countries, particularly Sweden and Norway, have introduced strong policy frameworks to support gender equality in tech and engineering, with female enrollment in STEM-related university programs exceeding 35%. Meanwhile, countries like India have seen a 28% rise in female participation in tech education over the past five years due to targeted scholarships and mentorship initiatives. These global patterns demonstrate that systemic encouragement can lead to significant gender diversification in fields traditionally dominated by men, offering a template Pakistan can adapt and refine.\nIn conclusion, the rising enrollment of female students in AI and other tech-driven disciplines is not just a promising trend, it’s a powerful statement of progress. With continued institutional support, inspiring mentorship, and changing societal attitudes, women are poised to lead the next wave of innovation in Pakistan’s digital future.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
