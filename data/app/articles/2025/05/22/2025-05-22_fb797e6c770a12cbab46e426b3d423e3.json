With shared experiences, he said, “We can come up with solutions and cope with the challenge of climate change.” He said, “We can help and learn from each other.”\nHe said Australia’s support continues to strengthen climate resilience, education, and gender equality through grassroots partnerships that uplift Pakistani communities.\nMr Hawkins said, “We are exporting Australian cows to Pakistan as these are very popular here. “The Australian cows are different from the European cows as they are used to hot weather conditions and give good milk, he added.\nThe High Commissioner also highlighted the enduring cooperation of more than 40 years of working together to build resilience in the agriculture and water sectors, and the longstanding defence ties.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
