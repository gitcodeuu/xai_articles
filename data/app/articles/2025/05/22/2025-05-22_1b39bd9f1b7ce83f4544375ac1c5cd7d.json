Islamabad’s 80 union councils will also take part in the campaign.\nA total of 461,125 children under the age of five will be vaccinated in the federal capital through door-to-door visits by polio teams. To ensure maximum coverage, two extra days will be observed as “catch-up” days, during which teams will revisit homes where children may have been missed.\nAhead of the campaign, an assessment meeting was held under the supervision of Additional Deputy Commissioner (East) Mehreen Baloch. Representatives from the World Health Organization and other departments attended the meeting to review the city’s preparedness.\nThe Additional Deputy Commissioner directed officials to fully utilize all available resources to ensure the success of the vaccination campaign. She said the cooperation of residents would be key in eliminating the virus from the region.\nDuring the session, the authorities also reviewed the training status of polio workers and discussed security arrangements for the campaign.\nMehreen Baloch urged all departments and communities to support the drive, saying collective efforts are necessary to protect children from polio.\nThe national immunization initiative aims to strengthen immunity among children and stop the transmission of the poliovirus in Pakistan, which remains one of the few countries where the disease still exists.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
