We must remain vigilant and united to protect Pakistan’s sovereignty,” he added.\nNasir Abbas said Modi had adopted a dangerous unilateral approach where he “plays judge, jury, and executioner,” posing a serious threat to regional stability and trying to destabilize the peace of the region in collaboration with Israel.\n“Modi is a terrorist who has repeatedly tried to impose war on our peace-loving nation. He wants to establish Indian supremacy in the region through cowardly tactics,” Senator Nasir said, adding that the Pakistani nation stands united with its valiant armed forces. “Every individual in this nation has the courage to take up arms in the defence of the motherland.”\nSenator Abdul Qadir hailed the armed forces’ response as a “historic moment of pride,” congratulating the Pakistan Army, Navy, and Pakistan Air Force (PAF) for their coordinated and forceful retaliation.\nHe said nation is observing Youm-e-Tashakur (Thanksgiving Day) today to mark the historic victory of Marka-e-Haq and to pay tribute to the armed forces.\n“India is not interested in resolving the Kashmir dispute peacefully. It has weaponized water by suspending the Indus Waters Treaty — water is Pakistan’s lifeline,” he warned.\nSenator Jam Saifullah Khan expressed deep sorrow over the martyrdom of civilians and condemned the targeting of mosques and innocent lives, and called it an international crime.\nHe extended gratitude to friendly nations, especially China, for their unwavering support in this critical time.\nSenator Khalil Tahir Sandu paid glowing tributes to Squadron Leader Usman Yousaf, Mubashir Hussain, and other martyrs who laid down their lives in defence of the nation.\nHe commended Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar, and Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir for their decisive leadership.\n“India’s illegal aggression was responded to with strength and strategy. The nation stood shoulder-to-shoulder with its forces and proved its unity to the world,” he said.\nSenator Aon Abbas said the celebration of Youm-e-Tashakur was a testament to Pakistan’s resolve and national unity. “Whenever the enemy tries aggression, Pakistan responds as one.
