Non-compliant materials were seized on the spot.\n“This crackdown is part of our sustained efforts to enforce environmental laws and reduce plastic pollution in the capital,” said Dr Abbas. “Strict action will continue against those disregarding the ban.”\nThe 2023 regulations prohibit the manufacture sale, and use of single-use plastics within Islamabad to combat environmental degradation.\nAuthorities have urged the public to switch to eco-friendly alternatives and report violations to Pak-EPA.\nSimilar operations are expected in other markets to ensure compliance with the ban.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
