Now the nation will have to make economic progress by utilizing the resources available. Pakistan is endowed with immense talent and human resources,” he stressed.\nHe thanked the brotherly and friendly countries including United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, China, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the United States for supporting Pakistan.\nHe also thanked US President Donald Trump for his efforts to restore peace in the region.\nHe said Pakistan could not have successfully defended itself without the professional expertise and preparedness of the armed forces.\nHe thanked Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir, Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Naveed Ashraf for their leadership during the Marka-e-Haq.\nThe federal ministers, chiefs of the armed forces, high ranking military and civil officials and prominent people from all walks of life attended the event.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
