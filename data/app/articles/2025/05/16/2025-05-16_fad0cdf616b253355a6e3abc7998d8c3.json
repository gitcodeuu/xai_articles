Besides, it will also encourage international investment, help create new job opportunities,” according to a PM Office press release.\nThe prime minister directed that Additional Customs Duty (currently ranging from 2% to 7%) and Regulatory Duty (currently varying from 5% to 90%) be eliminated over the next four to five years.\nSimilarly, the Customs Duty will be capped at a maximum of 15% as currently, for some items, the rate exceeds even 100%. The number of duty slabs has also been reduced to four to ease legal complexities related to imports and provide a level playing field to various industries.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz reiterated that his government was committed to developing a strong economy, creating employment opportunities, and doing away with inflation.\nHe said that after thorough consultations with national and international economic experts, a comprehensive plan for fundamental economic reforms had been formulated, and the decision to reduce customs duties was also part of those reforms.\nThe prime minister’s “historic decision” will open the economy to foreign investment and ensure that domestic industries have easy and affordable access to raw materials, intermediate goods, and capital equipment. Moreover, increased competitiveness will enable local industries to become more efficient and competitive, to assist in controlling inflation and stabilizing the national currency.\nThe prime minister viewed that tariff reduction would help stabilize the current account deficit and contribute to higher revenue collection, and also formed an implementation committee on the subject.\nThe meeting was attended by federal minister Jam Kamal Khan, Ahad Cheema, Muhammad Aurangzeb, and Ali Pervaiz Malik, Special Assistant to PM Haroon Akhtar, and senior officials of relevant departments.",
