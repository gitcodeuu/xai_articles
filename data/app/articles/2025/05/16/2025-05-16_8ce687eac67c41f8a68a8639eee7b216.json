  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 16 (APP):Zaheer Mehdi has joined Jazz as Group Head Corporate and Regulatory Affairs on Friday.\nIn this role, he will also support governance across Jazz’s financial services entities — Mobilink Bank and JazzCash — as the company strengthens its institutional oversight and strategic preparedness.\nZaheer has over 30 years of experience in corporate banking, regulatory affairs, public policy, and financial services.\nBefore joining Jazz, he served as Chief Government and Corporate Relations Officer at Engro Corporation, where he led regulatory advocacy and contributed to corporate strategy as part of the Executive Committee.\nHis distinguished career includes senior roles at Standard Chartered, where he served as CEO of Standard Chartered Modaraba and Managing Director of Standard Chartered Bank, working closely with regulators, policymakers, and industry stakeholders.\nAs part of this transition, Jazz also announced that Syed Fakhar Ahmed, who has led the Corporate and Regulatory Affairs function with distinction, will now take on the role of Advisor, Special Initiatives. Over the years, Fakhar has played an instrumental role in advancing Jazz’s public policy agenda, expanding high-level engagement, and ensuring the company’s credible voice during moments of national importance — from the COVID-19 pandemic and 2022 floods to the evolving geopolitical climate.\nWelcoming him to the leadership team, Aamir Ibrahim, CEO of Jazz and Chairman of Mobilink Bank said: “Zaheer’s appointment reflects our commitment to strengthening institutional relationships and regulatory alignment as we evolve into a multi-vertical Service Co.\nHis cross-industry experience and deep understanding of policy and governance will be key to our next chapter. I would also like to thank Fakhar for his steady leadership and the impact he’s made in advancing Jazz’s external engagement agenda.”\nThese leadership changes are aligned with Jazz’s broader transformation into Pakistan’s leading ServiceCo—an integrated digital services company serving over 100 million users across fintech (JazzCash), entertainment (Tamasha), digital self-care (SIMOSA), insurtech (FikrFree), cloud (Garaj), and gaming (GameNow). This evolution reflects Jazz’s strategic shift from connectivity to capability, delivering technology-driven platforms that improve lives and livelihoods across the country.",
