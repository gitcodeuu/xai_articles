In 2024-2025, 8 million more women gained mobile internet access, reducing the gender gap from 38% to 25%—the highest improvement globally, led by rural women.\nThe prime minister said these gains were part of Pakistan’s broader digital transformation. “We have crossed 200 million telecom subscriptions, 150 million broadband users, and 2 million FTTH connections، while our mobile manufacturing grew by 47.46%, and international connectivity was boosted through high-capacity submarine cables.\n“Today, Pakistan’s mobile ecosystem contributes $16.7 billion to the economy,” he added.\n“On this important day, I call on all stakeholders to champion gender-responsive digital transformation and continue building an inclusive and empowered digital Pakistan,” he added.",
