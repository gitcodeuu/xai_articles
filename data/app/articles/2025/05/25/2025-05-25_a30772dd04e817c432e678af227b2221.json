While Pakistan’s befitting response effectively silenced Indian aggression on the ground, the Modi regime’s relentless Hindutva-driven rhetoric continues to fuel anxiety across the region, especially among women and children across the Line of Control. India’s war hysteria and provocative statements have kept tensions simmering, disturbing any semblance of peace and stability in South Asia.\nPeople in India and Pakistan shared deep anxiety before the 2025 conflict. A man admitted he struggled to sleep, while Sajid, a 12-year-old boy from Rawalpindi, feared every loud bang was an airstrike. A 15-year-old girl from Hyderabad suffered nightmares and was scared to leave home. Shereya, a mother from Poonch District, worried constantly for her children. Such anxiety is widespread, with more diagnosed cases of war-related fear, vigilance, insomnia, and emotional numbness.\nChildren were especially affected. Rakesh, 12, from Uri Sector India, stopped watching cartoons and only followed tense daily news. Ajay, 14, from India’s Rajouri, was scared by violent social media images he didn’t fully understand. These stories reveal how conflict stresses children before they can cope with trauma.\nCivilians near the Line of Control (LOC) shared common fear, trauma, and little support from Indian authorities. Ayesha, 15, from Kotli District in India, described the terror of drones overhead and fleeing homes after a shell killed a newlywed. Arooj, 23, from Pakistan’s Bagh city, said fear worsened after airstrikes, with sirens and blackouts forcing evacuation. Afaf, 22, from Leepa Valley, shared similar feelings, praying peace prevails in the area.\nBoth sides war affectees want more support from their relevant authorities and stressed for putting more efforts to ensure peace in the region. Ananya, 18, from India’s Kupwara, said the Indian government’s aid was limited, forcing reliance on social media and neighbours. One respondent from Pakistan’s border area, Zafar said, “We never felt secure enough, not all can afford two homes.”\nThis hardship and uncertainty characterize civilian life near the LOC. Renowned analyst Zohaib observed that unverified social media posts and sensational news fueled panic, including false rumors about poisoned water. Meanwhile, analyst Saima Kayani praised Pakistani media for playing a more responsible role, contrasting it with Indian media, which she said aligns closely with the Modi government’s ideological stance.\nZohaib urged governments to create systems combining public information, mental health care, and peace support to reduce hostility. Health experts like Dr. Izza Nazir reported that constant war news worsened symptoms such as sleep problems and panic. Health expert Mominah Ambreen also stressed that even small fears affect people’s well-being. Suggested solutions included free mental health camps, awareness campaigns, and programmes in schools.\nDespite a ceasefire, fears of renewed fighting persist. Zohaib pointed out that incidents like Balakot keep people anxious during military drills. Yet, most young people want peace; a Gallup poll found they favour trade over conflict.\nBoth governments must collaborate on peacebuilding measures like education, veteran support, hotlines, and civil society engagement. Human stories—such as artists’ drawings of homesick soldiers and cross-border aid—foster more empathy than formal talks.\nThroughout history, wars have devastated humanity—destroying lives, homes, and economies while leaving deep psychological scars across generations. From ancient battles to modern conflicts, millions have suffered loss, displacement, trauma, and shattered communities. The toll extends beyond physical destruction, embedding fear, mistrust, and mental health crises in affected populations. Today, as tensions rise along the India-Pakistan border, the Modi regime’s war-driven rhetoric fuels anxiety and division, risking further harm. Instead of escalating conflict, leaders must prioritize peace, mental well-being, and cooperation to break this tragic cycle and safeguard the future of both nations’ people.\nThough the 2025 conflict didn’t escalate into full war, it exposed a critical gap: national security must include citizens’ mental health. Ignoring the psychological toll risks raising generations burdened by fear, mistrust, and trauma. Lasting peace depends on diplomacy, media, and mental health efforts prioritizing people over politics.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
