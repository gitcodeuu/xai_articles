It is the future of global innovation. At COMSTECH, we are committed to harnessing the power of science and technology to enable sustainable development, nurture local talent, and build resilient communities throughout Africa.”\nCOMSTECH’s efforts have included hands-on training workshops in renewable energy, biotechnology, information and communication technologies, and environmental sciences.\nThrough partnerships with institutions like TWAS, the University of Lahore, ICCBS, and HUCM, hundreds of African scholars have been awarded fully funded research fellowships, technical training, and academic degrees in Pakistan.\nIn addition to academic support, COMSTECH has strengthened scientific research across Africa by funding collaborative projects that unite African universities with counterparts across the OIC.\nThese projects tackle pressing challenges such as food security, public health, and climate resilience. Scientific conferences and seminars held in Nigeria, Ethiopia, and other countries have facilitated knowledge exchange and fostered long-term institutional partnerships.\nCOMSTECH has also taken significant steps to improve health systems in African nations. A comprehensive five-year action plan includes disease surveillance training, health policy workshops, and virtual health networks. In cooperation with the Islamic Development Bank and LRBT, COMSTECH has organized cataract surgery camps in Niger, Chad, and Somalia, trained ophthalmologists in managing diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, and conducted specialized workshops on topics including leishmaniasis, neurology, and histopathology in cities such as Addis Ababa, Kampala, and Mogadishu.\nEfforts to support infrastructure development have led to the establishment of centres of excellence and Halal authentication laboratories, most notably at the Islamic University in Uganda and the provision of advanced scientific instruments in Mauritania and Chad. COMSTECH’s expert missions have also helped restore and operationalize critical laboratory equipment.\nWomen and youth are at the heart of COMSTECH’s programs. Through mentorship schemes, scholarships, and the COMSTECH Youth Leadership Training initiative, young African professionals are brought to Islamabad to work on science and technology policy solutions.\nIn Nigeria, a COMSTECH-IsDB initiative has advanced citrus processing technologies, while in The Gambia, a partnership with the Al-Khwarizmi Institute has resulted in the launch of a Master’s in Computer Science curriculum and an ICT vocational training center.\nBetween 2022 and 2024 alone, more than 70 African awardees benefited from fellowships and targeted programs, including those for Least Developed Countries (LDCs).\nTo date, over 161 individuals from OIC and non-OIC African states have been supported through COMSTECH’s diverse educational and training initiatives. Moreover, COMSTECH has covered travel costs for over 40 African scholars to participate in major conferences on topics such as neglected tropical diseases, precision agriculture, natural product chemistry, and water resource management.\nUnder the COMSTECH-Gourmet Industrial Internship Program, young  researchers from  African countries were placed  in various departments of the leading food industry of Pakistan, and more would be placed on a yearly basis.\nThese wide-ranging and impactful initiatives reflect COMSTECH’s unwavering commitment to advancing scientific capacity, fostering innovation, and enabling sustainable development across Africa through dedicated cooperation and strategic support.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
