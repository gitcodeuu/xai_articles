The Practice Competition aligns with our vision for an Intelligent World 2030 and encourages students to master cloud computing, big data, and AI to drive social progress. The Innovation Competition focuses on green development and digital inclusion, motivating participants to solve real-world challenges in sectors like agriculture, healthcare, and education through ICT.”\nAs digital transformation is accelerating globally, the demand for skilled professionals in fields such as AI, big data, and cybersecurity continues to grow. However, the shortage of talent in these critical areas is becoming increasingly evident. To help tackle this challenge, the Huawei ICT Competition features multiple tracks — including Practice, Innovation, and Programming — alongside initiatives such as industry-academia collaboration and tailored curriculum development. These efforts aim to equip students with in-demand skills and foster the next-generation tech talent who will stand out in an increasingly intelligent and digital world.\nDuring this year’s competition, Huawei also hosted the AI Accelerating Education Transformation Summit, where experts explored the pivotal role of AI in smart education. In addition, Huawei officially announced the AI Capability of the Huawei ICT Academy Intelligent Platform, making it easier and more efficient for educators and students to use.
