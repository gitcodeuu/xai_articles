Participants were encouraged to explore the tactile, grounding qualities of the material as a means of self-expression and emotional release.\nThe workshop was a creative outlet and a space for mindfulness and reflection.\n“The Art of Pottery” is part of PNCA’s broader commitment to mental health advocacy through the arts.\nThe Art for Therapy series aims to spotlight the importance of integrating creative practices into daily life as a tool for emotional resilience, mental wellbeing, and social connection.\nPNCA organizes such workshops monthly, ensuring continuous access to arts-based therapeutic experiences for the wider community.\nThese initiatives reaffirm PNCA’s role as a cultural institution that nurtures not only artistic excellence but also holistic wellness.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
