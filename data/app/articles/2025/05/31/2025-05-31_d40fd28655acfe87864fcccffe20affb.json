Together, let us work toward a tobacco-free Pakistan, a nation where our people can live, work, and thrive in an environment that values health, safety, and well-being.”\nResearch has shown that measures such as tobacco taxation are effective in increasing revenues for the government while also reducing consumption, tobacco-related diseases, and pressure on health systems.\nPakistan ratified the World Health Organization Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (WHO FCTC) in 2004, and WHO provides continuous technical support to the Ministry of National Health Services Regulations and Coordination and the Federal Board of Revenue in areas such as tobacco tax policy and track-and-trace implementation.\nWHO Deputy Representative in Pakistan Ellen Thom said, “The 164,000 people dead to tobacco every year are not just numbers. They are workers with families. They are sons and daughters. They are also teenagers and children, who are particularly vulnerable and an easy target for the advertisement of the tobacco industry.”\nHe said,”Let us unmask the appeal. Tobacco is not a candy; it is a killer, and we need to protect our children, our families, and our communities.”",
