It proposes Divine Economics, a paradigm where human behavior is shaped not solely by self-interest but by deeper moral, spiritual, and communal values. The framework incorporates concern for the individual, family, nation, environment, and the ultimate reality, offering a value-based foundation for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\nThe research was supervised by Dr. Atiq ur Rehman and Dr. Muhammad Jamil, while the external evaluation was conducted by eminent economists Dr. Zahid Siddique Mughal and Dr. Iftikhar Hussain Adil from NUST, Islamabad. The public defense, held at the Kashmir Institute of Economics, was attended by faculty members, students, and researchers from various departments of UAJK.\nDr. Ali Abidi is the son of renowned economist Prof. Dr. Syed Nisar Hussain Hamdani, the founding figure behind Divine Economics and former Director of the Kashmir Institute of Economics.\nProf. Hamdani’s pioneering work has earned international recognition for challenging the utilitarian foundations of mainstream economics and for promoting a spiritually enriched approach to economic policymaking. His model has paved the way for a new generation of economists to explore dimensions of faith, ethics, and social responsibility in economic behavior and development theory.\nIn extending its congratulations, the UAJK’s community commended Dr. Abidi for his remarkable contribution to the academic discourse. It reaffirmed its commitment to fostering research that bridges tradition, spirituality, and modern development needs.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
