  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP):Federal Law Minister Azam Nazir Tarar on Friday reaffirmed the government’s commitment to an independent judiciary while highlighting irregularities in a £190 million settlement case.\nHe said that matters under Article 175 lie exclusively within the judiciary’s domain.\nTalking to media persons, Tarar explained that the issue of £190 million first came to light when the current government took office. The matter was discussed in a cabinet meeting where it was revealed that the UK’s Asset Recovery Unit had launched an investigation. Initially, Hussain Nawaz was among those named in the case but was later cleared following an inquiry.\nThe case then shifted focus to Malik Riaz’s Bahria Town family, who became central to the settlement. Tarar outlined that, under the law, the recovered amount should have been handed over to the federal government.\nDuring the previous administration, a sealed envelope was presented in the cabinet by Shahzad Akbar and former Prime Minister Imran Khan. They informed the cabinet that the UK’s National Crime Agency (NCA) had seized £190 million and that the amount should be returned to Pakistan. Approval for this transfer was obtained secretly, and Akbar, acting as Pakistan’s agent, signed an agreement related to the funds.\nWhen the new government assumed power, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to investigate the matter. A cabinet committee was also formed to examine the details, while the Attorney General’s office was instructed to file a case in the Supreme Court, arguing that the funds belonged to taxpayers and must be deposited into the federal treasury.\nDespite the government’s efforts, the case dragged on for over a year. Tarar criticized Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders for making media statements instead of presenting their case in court. Ultimately, a trial court handed down convictions of 10 and 7 years for those found guilty.\nThe law minister’s underscored the government’s commitment to transparency and justice while emphasizing the role of the judiciary in addressing such issues.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
