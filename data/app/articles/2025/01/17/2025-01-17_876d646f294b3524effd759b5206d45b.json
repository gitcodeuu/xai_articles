  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 17 (APP): Speaker of the National Assembly, Ayaz Sadiq, on Friday expressed his displeasure over the opposition’s disregard for an earlier agreement regarding the quorum during the Question Hour.\nSpeaking during the proceeding of the house he said that it had been mutually agreed in a meeting that the quorum would not be pointed out during the Question Hour and on Private Members’ Day.\nHighlighting the importance of the Question Hour, the Speaker said that this segment of parliamentary proceedings is vital for raising public concerns and ensuring accountability. “Significant time and effort are invested in preparing questions that enable members to bring critical public issues to the attention of government ministers,” he added.\nAyaz Sadiq called on National Assembly members to prioritize public issues and work constructively to maintain the smooth functioning of the House. He stressed the need for a collaborative and positive approach to parliamentary proceedings.\nHowever, despite the prior agreement, Sunni Ittehad Council legislator Iqbal Afridi pointed out the lack of quorum, on which the Speaker adjourned the session until Monday at 5:00 PM.",
