As the country continues to improve infrastructure and facilitate travel, it is poised to become a leading destination for adventure and cultural tourism in 2025 and beyond.”\nRecently, CNN, the leading global media house, has added Pakistan to the list of 25 worth visiting tourist destinations around the world in 2025, he said adding that the New York Times, USA’s leading newspaper, has also included Pakistan in the list of 52 places to visit in 2025.\nLast year, UK-based travel magazine “Fascinating Pakistan” published an article on Pakistan’s efforts to promote tourism at World Travel Mart London.\nSimilarly, various newspapers and magazines in Pakistan have also given high coverage to Pakistan’s participation in these international fairs.",
