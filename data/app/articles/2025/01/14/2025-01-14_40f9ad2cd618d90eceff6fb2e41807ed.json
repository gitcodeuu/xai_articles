Efforts to create a rift between the public and the army stem from foreign agenda”, he added.\nWhile urging unity against the menace of terrorism, General Asim Munir said, “the existence of the state ensures the existence of politics; God forbid, if there is no state, there is nothing. We must all stand united against terrorism, without any discrimination or prejudice”.\nHe said, “Creating disorder is a grave sin, and without the state, nothing else matters”.\nThe army chief reaffirmed that Pakistan’s revolves around national interest. “Our policy is only Pakistan,” he said.\nThe COAS said Afghanistan is our “brotherly neighbour” and an Islamic country and reiterated Pakistan’s desire for better bilateral relations with Afghanistan, stating differences arise only over the presence of Fitnal al Khawarij and cross-border terrorism. “This difference will remain until the issue is addressed,” he added.",
