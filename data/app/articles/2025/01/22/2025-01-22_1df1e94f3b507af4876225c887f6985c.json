In his address, Khan emphasized the transformative potential of this initiative. “This journey began with discussions between OGRA and FBR in August 2024, highlighting the urgent need for digitizing the oil supply chain. The launch of ‘Raahguzar’ is the first phase of a broader track-and-trace system aimed at promoting accountability, preventing economic leakages, curbing illegal activities, and enhancing the oil industry’s integrity,” he stated.\nKhan further added, “This initiative will serve as a game-changer in addressing the challenges posed by illegal petrol pumps and malpractices, contributing significantly to the growth and sustainability of the oil sector in Pakistan.”\nThe launch of ‘Raahguzar’ reflects OGRA’s commitment to leveraging technology for effective governance and fostering a transparent and accountable energy ecosystem.\nFor further details or to download the ‘Raahguzar’ app, visit OGRA’s official website or contact the OGRA helpline.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
