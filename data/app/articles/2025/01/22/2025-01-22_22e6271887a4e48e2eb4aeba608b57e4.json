To address the shortage of teachers, Allama Iqbal Open University has been providing training to educators for schools, colleges, and universities for the past five decades, said the Vice-Chancellor of Allama Iqbal Open University, Professor Dr. Nasir Mahmood on Wednesday.\nIn a statement, he said that, “There is hardly any school, college, or university in the country, including the provinces of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir, where a teacher trained by this national institution is not serving.”\nThe university has announced admissions for a two-year Associate Degree in Education (ADE) for primary-level teachers and 1.5, 2.5, and 4-year B.Ed programs for secondary-level teachers.\nThe deadline for ADE admissions is February 17, while admission forms for B.Ed programs can be submitted until February 10.\nThe admission forms and prospectuses for these programs are available on the university’s website.\nFor the convenience of students, admission forms are also available at the university’s campuses and designated sale points across the country.
