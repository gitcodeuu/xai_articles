Other Members of the Bench include Justice Jamal Mandokhail, JusticeMuhammad Ali Mazhar, Justice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, Justice Musarrat Hilali, Justice Naeem Akhtar Afghan and Justice Shahid Bilal Hasan.\nJustice Hasan Azhar Rizvi, during the proceedings, questioned the Counsel that there were attacks on the GHQ, Naval Airbase Karachi and many other sensitive installations. In what courts legal proceedings of such incidents took place? Is the case of May 9 riots more serious than the aforementioned one?\nJustice Jamal Mandokhail questioned that an accused is acquitted by the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) and convicted in a Military Court. How can this be possible? Is the evidence produced before the military court is hidden from an ATC?\nJustice Jamal Mandokhail remarked that the President of Pakistan has the authority to suspend fundamental rights and the Executive has to implement the presidential decree. In case of lawfully declared emergency, fundamental rights are suspended but still the courts these rights can be defended in the Courts.\nJustice Musarrat Hilali observed that there was no lawfully declared emergency when the accused in May 9 riots were taken into custody. She framed a question before the Counsel that who will determine that which case to go to the military courts and which to other courts?\nJustice Mazhar inquired that FIRs of the accused in May 9 riots were the same. How some of them were tried in military courts and some in other courts?\nArguments of the Counsel for the Ministry of Defense were dealing mostly with technical legal aspects of the petition. Referring to the SCP Judgment, he said the Supreme Court declared Article 233 ineffective while it has nothing to do with the military courts. Under this Article, the President of Pakistan can suspend fundamental rights through declaration of emergency.\nThe proceedings were however adjourned for tomorrow (Friday) and counsel for the Ministry of Defense will continue his arguments.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
