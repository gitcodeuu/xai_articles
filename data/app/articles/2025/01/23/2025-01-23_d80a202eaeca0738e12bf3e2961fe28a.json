This cosmic display can be enjoyed with the naked eye or through telescopes, making it a treat for both amateur and professional astronomers.\nThe Space Education and Awareness Drive (SEAD) has urged space enthusiasts to seize this opportunity and plan their observations during the event’s peak period, emphasizing that clear skies will enhance the experience.\nThe rare chance to marvel at the beauty of our solar system in a stunning alignment will be source of attraction for the space enthusiast.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
