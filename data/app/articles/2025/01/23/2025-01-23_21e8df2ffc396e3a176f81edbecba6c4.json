It focused primarily on key export sectors, including textiles, ready-made garments, and leather, enhancing their competitiveness and ensuring continued access to the European Union’s Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+).\nMs. Romina stated that this project not only supported labour but also enhanced the industry’s effectiveness in addressing climate change, global environmental sustainability, and the need for the labour force to be better equipped in line with international standards.\nMs. Romina emphasized that the ILES project has been pivotal in strengthening compliance with international labour and environmental standards, contributing significantly to Pakistan’s national progress.\nShe noted that the project improved occupational safety and health, particularly in small factories, while boosting productivity in larger ones.\nFurthermore, the initiative played a crucial role in supporting policy reforms that align Pakistan’s frameworks with global standards, ensuring the nation’s industries remain competitive on the international stage.\n“The government of Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to fostering partnerships like ILES, which bring together public and private stakeholders as well as our international partners. These collaborations are essential in achieving our shared goals of sustainable development,” she said.\nShe also stressed that the end of the ILES project should not be seen as a conclusion but rather as a foundation upon which to build. “The insights, resources and networks generated through this initiative must now inform our broader national strategies,” she added. “Together, we can ensure that Pakistan not only meets its international obligations but also thrives as a leader in sustainable industrial practices.”\nMs. Romina assured the audience that the government would continue to support initiatives like ILES, reaffirming Pakistan’s commitment to environmental sustainability, global competitiveness, and inclusive economic growth.\nSecretary of Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, Dr. Arshad Mahmood highlighted the achievements of the ILES project. Reflecting on its impact, he noted that the project fostered a new culture of safeguarding labour rights at both the federal and provincial government levels.\nSpeaking at the event, Director General of WWF-Pakistan, Hammad Naqi Khan said WWF-Pakistan is actively promoting organic cotton cultivation to enhance sustainability and reduce environmental impacts. The organization has engaged over 13,000 farmers across approximately 80,000 acres, with 21,833 acres certified organic.\nHe provided an overview of the ILES project and emphasized that while the SMEs sector had been overlooked in the past, this initiative helped establish valuable partnerships with the private sector.",
