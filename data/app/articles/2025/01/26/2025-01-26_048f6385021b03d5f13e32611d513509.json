  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 25 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Qaiser Ahmed Sheikh said on Saturday that dialogue must prioritize the country’s interests above all else, asserting that there is no alternative to negotiations.\nSpeaking to a private news channel, she said, “Neither the government, the opposition, nor the people of Pakistan can afford a deadlock in dialogue. PTI should have waited for the government’s written response to their demands.”\nHe further stressed that negotiations should focus on the well-being of the country and its citizens, rather than being treated as a contest for political victory or defeat.\n“Setting aside personal grievances is crucial. For the welfare of the people, we must engage in dialogue with a sense of responsibility,” he added.\nHighlighting recent economic improvements, the minister underscored the need for a serious approach to achieve political stability. “The country has made economic progress, but now it’s time to adopt a mature attitude to ensure political stability for long-term benefits,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
