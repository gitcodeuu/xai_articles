Therefore, the process of translations in Pakistan needs to be expanded, and scholars and the religious community can play an exemplary role in this noble cause.\nProf. Dr. Nasir Mahmood expressed these views while addressing the closing ceremony of a five-day training workshop titled “Translation as a Science,” held yesterday at the university.\nHe further stated that the promotion of Islamic values and traditions has, unfortunately, remained a distant dream, which now needs to be realized.\nThe Vice-Chancellor highlighted the elevated status of religious scholars in society, noting that their words carry weight, and people trust and believe what they say.\nHe urged religious scholars to take the lead in promoting Islamic values and contributing to societal reform.\nDr. Nasir Mahmood thanked Dr. Ghulam Ali, Director of the Center for Languages and Translation Studies, and Fakhruddin Akhunzada, Executive Director of the Forum for Language Initiatives, for organizing the workshop and congratulated them on its success.\nThe workshop was organized by the university’s Center for Languages and Translation Studies in collaboration with the Forum for Language Initiatives.\nIt provided translation training to participants from 12 different languages.\nParticipants expressed their views, describing the training as highly beneficial.\nThey shared that they had learned the principles and techniques of translation within a short period.
