  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 10 (APP):The Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority (IHRA) has refuted misleading media reports, and clarified facts on November 26 events.\nIn response to recent media reports circulating about the events of November 26, the authority through a handout has issued a strong denial and clarification regarding several claims made in the media.\nThe hospitals categorically refuted the allegations to set the record straight with accurate, evidence-based information.\n“First and foremost, any suggestion that hospitals were overwhelmed by the number of casualties is completely unfounded.”\nThe authority said that these medical facilities have consistently demonstrated their ability to handle major emergencies, from natural disasters like earthquakes to global crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTheir capacity to manage such situations has been proven time and again with efficiency, professionalism, and resilience.\nFurthermore, the allegation that surgeries were conducted without administering anesthesia is not only false but also deeply harmful. “Such claims are malicious and aimed at tarnishing the reputation of the healthcare institutions and the dedicated professionals who work within them.”\nThe IHRA said that medical procedures are governed by strict ethical guidelines, professional protocols, and legal frameworks, all of which make such actions impossible.\nThe source of these unfounded allegations appears to stem from either deliberate misinformation or unverified, irrelevant sources, both of which are irresponsible and misleading.\nThe authority added that hospitals also addressed the circulation of purported lists on social media, which claim to be official hospital records.\nThese lists are not authentic and have not been verified or certified by hospital authorities.\nThe inclusion of “Firearm Injury” in some of these lists is particularly concerning.\nIt said that the initial information recorded in hospital forms is based on statements from patients’ attendants and does not reflect the professional opinions of the attending doctors.\n“In light of these baseless claims, the Board of Authority urges all stakeholders, including the media, to avoid disseminating unverified information that could damage the credibility of the healthcare system.”\nSuch misinformation not only creates unnecessary panic but also erodes public trust in the medical professionals and institutions that serve the community.\nThe authority said that it is essential for all involved to prioritize accuracy and responsibility when reporting on sensitive matters related to public health and safety.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
