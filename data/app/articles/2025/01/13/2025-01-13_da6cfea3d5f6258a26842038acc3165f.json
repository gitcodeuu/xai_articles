Climate change has hit Pakistan hard, and we have been ranked fifth in terms of vulnerability,” said Alam. “We are a resilient nation, and we are working hard to implement measures that will help mitigate the impact of climate change.”\nSecretary of MoCC, Aisha Humera Moriani also addressed the meeting, pointing out that Pakistan’s greatest challenge lies in accessing climate finance.\nShe explained that while investment is important, it is not enough to address the immediate needs for rehabilitation in areas affected by heatwaves and the melting of glaciers.\n“We cannot allocate loan amounts for rehabilitation efforts,” Moriani said. “These funds should be directed towards the country’s GDP growth, not for recovering from climate disasters.”\nAisha Moriani further shared that Pakistan is actively pursuing water desalination technologies to conserve fresh water, and that incentives are being provided for the adoption of clean energy technologies.\nKjell Magne Bondevik expressed his country’s willingness to collaborate with Pakistan in mitigating the impacts of climate change.\nHe offered his role to support in helping Pakistan transition to green energy, citing Norway’s successful implementation of electric vehicles (EVs) as an example.\nAdditional Secretary, Hammad Shamimi and Joint Secretary, Muhammad Faroque of MoCC also attended the meeting.\nIn a gesture of goodwill, PM Coordinator on Climate Change, Romina Khurshid Alam presented souvenirs and Pakistani-made footballs to the members of the Norwegian delegation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
