This places us at the heart of the global effort to eliminate this disease,” he said.\nHe highlighted the dire consequences if action is not taken. “If we do not act, Pakistan will face over 11 million HCV cases by 2035, leading to over 500,000 liver cirrhosis cases, 100,000 cases of liver cancer, and 130,000 HCV-related deaths.\nThe economic impact would be a loss of over $285 million annually, he added.\nDr. Bharath pointed out that as of 2021, only 16% of Hepatitis C cases in the country had received treatment, with testing and treatment access being the key challenges.\nHe added to address these challenges, the federal government, in collaboration with provincial governments, has launched the Prime Minister’s Programme for the Elimination of Hepatitis C (HCV) Infection, which is allocated Rs 34.15 billion over the next three years.\nIn addition, provincial governments will contribute Rs 33.61 billion, bringing the total funding for the initiative to Rs 67.77 billion.\n“Pakistan has made significant strides toward Hepatitis elimination,” Dr. Bharath shared, “including establishing a National Technical Advisory Group (TAG) for Hepatitis control, developing national and provincial strategic frameworks, ensuring the availability of affordable generic Direct-Acting Antivirals (DAAs), and advocating for nationwide scaling up of vaccination, screening, testing, and treatment efforts.”\nHe stressed that further support and technical assistance are needed to scale up efforts.\n“We seek support in developing detailed plans for Hepatitis elimination, strengthening monitoring and healthcare systems, training healthcare workers, and expanding national software and logistics. We also call for international collaboration to help us achieve our targets,” he added.\nHe said that the Prime Minister’s Programme aims to reach 50% of the eligible population for screening, testing, and treatment within three years.\nDr. Bharath urged international partners to help Pakistan achieve 100% coverage, thus ensuring that the country meets the global HCV elimination targets before 2030.\nDr. Bharath emphasized the importance of collective action. “Hepatitis elimination is a national priority, but it requires the combined efforts of the government, international partners, civil society organizations, and non-governmental organizations.”\nHe added, “Together, we can overcome this challenge and work towards a healthier, prosperous future for all Pakistanis.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
