Bhandara, renowned journalist Nasim Zehra, and activist Nilofer Qazi.\nDozens of school children also joined the rewilding project, which aims to restore the area to its former ecological splendor, said a press release.\nTo further engage the community, IWMB has launched a weekly campaign inviting both school children and prominent citizens of Islamabad to participate in planting local trees at the site.\nThe goal is to restore the ridge to its former glory, creating a green Margalla viewpoint that will remain accessible to the public free of charge.\nThe rewilding project is being implemented in two phases. The first phase, currently underway, focuses on making the site accessible and safe for visitors.\nImmediate efforts are in progress to repair the area, including the installation of safety grills, benches, parking facilities, site clearing, and greening measures.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
