The Chairman and the two members of the Committee, all the three members are part of the Constitutional Bench.\nJustice Amin ud Din Khan offered the lawyers, who have observation about the Constitutional Bench that they can leave the floor for those who are willing to argue in support of their petitions.\nAdvocate Faisal Siddiqui pleaded before the Court that the 26th Amendment has damaged the trichotomy of power. He said that the Upper House of the parliament had no representation from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and was unable to pass a constitutional amendment.\nAdvocate Aziz Bhandari argued that the parliament was incomplete when such an important constitutional amendment was passed.  Voting took place among the available members instead of all members of the National Assembly. Advocate Imran Shafiq argued before the Court that the principal of seniority for appointment of the Chief Justice of Pakistan is replaced and now a judicial commission, with representation from the Executive has an effective say in the process, decides the appointment of CJP.\nBarrister Salahuddin pleaded before the Court that circumstances for free and fair voting were not suitable and the statement of a senior parliamentarian from Balochistan Muhammad Akhtar Mengal is evidence among many that undemocratic means were used to pass the amendment. He further stated that the house was without the women and minority MPs on reserved seats and incompletion of the House was established.\nThe Court did not agree to the opinions of petitioners for the formation of a full court, issued notices to the respondents and adjourned the hearing for three weeks.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
