Fadil met with Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Climate Change, Romina Khurshid Alam here on Monday.\nThey discussed critical issues related to climate change, food security, and the protection of vulnerable populations, particularly children.\nThe meeting underscored the importance of joint efforts between the government and international organizations to combat the impacts of climate-related disasters, including droughts and extreme weather events.\nThey emphasized the severe challenges posed by climate change, which have exacerbated food insecurity in Pakistan.\nAlam highlighted that food security is one of the greatest challenges of the future, as increasing droughts and climate variability threaten agriculture, disrupt food production, and exacerbate water shortages across the country.\nTo address this, she called for widespread promotion of climate-resilient agricultural practices, including the plantation of at least three fruit trees—avocado, orange, and banana—at every household.\nThis initiative, she explained, would help meet the growing food security challenges while also contributing to environmental sustainability.\nThe meeting also included a discussion of global best practices, with Alam citing the example of African countries that have successfully integrated crops like banana, avocado, and citrus into their agricultural economies.\n“These crops are now being exported to lucrative markets in Europe and the Middle East, providing African nations with significant economic benefits,” she said. “We believe Pakistan can benefit from similar efforts to promote these crops domestically and increase exports.”\nAlam emphasized the importance of empowering young girls with climate-resilient skills.\nReferring to her recent meeting with Dr. Haddy, the head of the Islamic World Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (ICESCO), Alam underscored the need for green-skilled education programs for girls.\nThese programs, she noted, would equip young women with the tools to navigate the challenges of a changing climate and become leaders in climate action.\nAlam also discussed the disproportionate impact of climate change on children, who are particularly vulnerable due to their limited capacity to adapt to environmental stresses.\n“What we have learned from floods in 2022, climate change-caused disasters in Pakistan is that the country, already one of the most climate-affected in the world, is experiencing intensified impacts, including extreme heatwaves, flooding, and shifting weather patterns,” she stated.\n“These disruptions are having a devastating effect on children, especially those living in poverty.”\nAbdullah A. Fadil highlighted the Unicef’s ongoing commitment to supporting the country’s most vulnerable populations, especially children, by providing aid in health, education, water, and sanitation sectors. Both parties agreed that targeted interventions are crucial to mitigating the climate-related vulnerabilities faced by children and ensuring their future well-being.\nThey emphasis on the need for enhanced collaboration to develop sustainable and inclusive solutions to climate-related challenges and expressed their commitment to integrating children’s needs into climate policies and actions, ensuring that the most vulnerable populations are not left behind in the fight against climate change.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
