A legal clarification is still awaited on this matter.\nThe committee discussed The Pakistan Medical and Dental Council (Amendment) Bill, 2024, and the Islamabad Healthcare Regulation (Amendment) Bill, 2024, moved by Ms. Shaista Pervaiz, MNA, both of which aim to reform and strengthen the medical regulatory framework.\nWith ongoing consultations with medical councils and stakeholders, the bills are expected to receive the final input once legal reviews are completed.\nThe committee reviewed The Pharmacy (Amendment) Bill, 2024, moved by Abdul Qadir Patel, MNA.\nThe committee directed the Pakistan Pharmacy Council of Pakistan to provide comparative analysis of a similar Bill passed by the Senate of Pakistan.\nThe aim is to harmonize the bills and address key concerns regarding the regulation of pharmacies and the council’s composition.\nA significant portion of the meeting was dedicated to reviewing Pakistan’s growing HIV/AIDS crisis, with over 13,000 new cases reported in 2024.\nThe committee acknowledged the expanded screening and testing services provided by the Common Management Unit (CMU) and emphasized the urgent need to strengthen diagnostic and preventive measures.\nThe rise in HIV cases, especially in high-burden districts was noted, with direction for enhanced monitoring, awareness campaigns and a stronger response to address transmission through high-risk activities.\nThe committee called for improvements in malaria prevention and the scaling up of TB diagnostics in the country.\nThere was a recognition that while TB treatment has a high success rate, the challenge remains in diagnosing and identifying new cases, with 300,000 individuals missing diagnosis every year.\nA focus on digital diagnostic tools, including 148 digital X-ray machines in high-burden districts, was highlighted as a promising solution.\nThe restructuring and upgrading of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Department at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) was also discussed.\nWith over 115 consultant-level vacancies at PIMS, the committee called for urgent recruitment to fill these positions and improve service delivery.\nThe committee also discussed the ongoing recruitment process at PIMS, the first in 23 years since the last one in 2013.\nThe meeting was informed that PIMS has been operating with a significant shortage of medical staff and doctors in the interim.\nThe meeting was attended by MNAs, Ms. Zahra Wadood Fatemi, Dr. Darshan, Dr. Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro, Ms. Sabheen Ghoury, Dr. Nikhat Shakeel Khan, Dr. Amjad Ali Khan, Mr. Nisar Ahmed (via zoom), Ms. Aliya Kamran, Shabbir Ali Qureshi, Dr. Shaista Khan, Shahram Khan, Ms. Farukh Khan, and Gul Asghar Khan.\nThe Coordinator to the Prime Minister on Health Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath also attended the meeting along with senior officials of the Ministry of Health and its attached departments.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
