  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 07 (APP):Diplomatic Enclave Shuttle Service, a lifeline for citizens visiting embassies for visas, has come under fire for its appalling conditions.\nThe cafeterias, meant to serve visitors, were riddled with unhygienic practices, and substandard items were being openly sold.\nVisitors complained of broken washrooms, foul odors, garbage piles, and even stables in the vicinity.\nSome waiting rooms shockingly had iron beds instead of proper seating.\n“The washrooms are completely unusable. There’s a terrible stench everywhere, and the waiting areas look like abandoned storerooms,” a frustrated visa applicant told APP.\nAbdul Rehman, another visitor complained about overpriced, substandard food: “The cafeterias are a rip-off. They sell stale snacks at exorbitant prices, and there’s no regard for hygiene.”\nAdding to the chaos, garbage piles and even stables were found in the area, creating an environment unfit for the thousands of citizens who rely on the service daily.\n“This is supposed to be the federal capital, yet these conditions are worse than those in rural areas,” remarked Sana a disappointed traveler.\nFollowing visitors’ complaints, Chairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa conducted a surprise visit on Tuesday and found the service in a deplorable state.\nTaking immediate action, Chairman Randhawa sealed both cafeterias on the spot and directed the Islamabad Food Authority to test the quality of food items.\nLegal proceedings against the cafeteria owners have also been initiated.\n“This is unacceptable. Citizens deserve better facilities,” Randhawa said while talking to media.\nHe has demanded an upgrade plan for the shuttle service within three weeks, emphasizing the need to transform the space into a clean, modern facility.\nCurrently operated under the CDA’s supervision following instructions from the Interior Minister, the service runs 10 electric buses daily to facilitate citizens.\nThe minister had stressed the importance of ensuring high-quality services for those seeking visas.\nThe CDA Chairman assured citizens that the area would soon be upgraded with top-notch facilities. “We are committed to providing the best services to the people,” he said.\nCDA officials, including members of the DMA, were present during the inspection.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
