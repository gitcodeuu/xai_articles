  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 07 (APP):In a surprise inspection ordered by Federal Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi, CDA Chairman Muhammad Ali Randhawa on Tuesday uncovered appalling conditions at the Diplomatic Enclave Shuttle Service.\nThe cafeterias and waiting areas were found littered with garbage, foul smells permeated the restrooms, and makeshift cots cluttered the rooms. Even a stable was discovered on-site.\nSubstandard food items were being openly sold to citizens visiting embassies for visa-related purposes, further exacerbating the already dire state of the facility.\nTaking immediate action, Chairman Randhawa sealed both cafeterias on the spot and directed legal proceedings against the owners. Samples of food items were sent to the Islamabad Food Authority for analysis.\n“The shuttle service area will be beautified and upgraded with the best facilities within three weeks,” assured Randhawa, as he demanded a comprehensive plan for the area’s improvement.\nUnder new CDA management, the shuttle service has already introduced 10 electric buses for daily operations, aiming to provide a better experience for citizens traveling to embassies.\nAccompanied by CDA members, DMA officials, and other relevant authorities, Randhawa reiterated the commitment to ensure citizens receive top-notch services in line with Minister Naqvi’s directives.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
