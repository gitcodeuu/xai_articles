These reforms are homegrown and based on the experience of indigenous employees of the Supreme Court. This approach ensures efficiency without incurring additional costs or causing disruptions to routine operations.\nThe Registrar elaborated on the adoption of technology as a key tool in the reform initiative. Existing software from High Courts is being customized and replicated to expedite implementation and avoid unnecessary costs. The reforms also include a phased framework developed by a core group of experts, with clear targets set for achievement within 3-6 months, 3 years, and 5 years.\nHe stressed that the focus is on providing predictable and timely justice to restore citizens’ trust in the judicial system and, by extension, the state. He further noted that sustained and consistent delivery of justice is essential to prevent the erosion of state legitimacy and to counter the influence of non-state actors.\nThe Registrar also shared that the Supreme Court has opened a dedicated communication channel for citizens, litigants, and stakeholders to provide feedback on judicial reforms through the official website https://www.scp.gov.pk/Feedback.aspx. This initiative aims to ensure inclusivity and responsiveness in the reform process.\nThe session concluded with an engaging question-and-answer discussion, during which the Chief Justice addressed queries from the probationers. As a token of respect and goodwill, souvenirs were exchanged between the delegation and the Supreme Court.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
