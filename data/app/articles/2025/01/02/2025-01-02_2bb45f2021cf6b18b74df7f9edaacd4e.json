We must honor scholars to encourage them to produce more remarkable work.”\nCultural Counsellor at the Embassy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dr. Majid Mashki, remarked, “Translating poetry is not an easy task, as it requires preserving the essence, culture, rhythm, and theme of the original.”\n“The translators have performed this challenging task with great dedication, and their efforts deserve immense praise,” he added.\nOne of the book’s translators, Dr. Mehr Noor Muhammad Khan, shed light on Qaisar Aminpur, describing him as a modern Iranian poet, writer, researcher, and professor at Tehran University.\nThe other translator, Dr. Muzaffar Ali Kashmiri, mentioned, “Qaisar Aminpur lived for only 48 years but authored nine books, five of which have been translated into Arabic, Persian, and now Urdu.”\nDr. Mohiuddin Hashmi of Allama Iqbal Open University highlighted that much of our civilization, language, and intellectual heritage was rooted in Persian.\nDr. Abid Sial, Head of the Department of Pakistani Languages at NUML University, attributed the introduction of a fine Persian poet’s work into Urdu to the efforts of his mentors.\nDr. Amber Yasmeen, Head of the Urdu Department at NUML University, noted that while translations of Persian classical literature into Urdu exist, contemporary works were seldom translated. The translators had skillfully chosen words to render an excellent Urdu version.\nDr. Shagufta Yaseen remarked, “Qaisar Aminpur remains alive through his poetry even after his death.”\nShe added, “Both translators, who are also her mentors, hold a prestigious status in her eyes.”\nThe institution’s Executive Director (ED), Dr. Rashid Hameed, inaugurated the event by stating, “Pakistan enjoys strong relations with Iran. Persian classical literature has been translated into Urdu multiple times, as translations serve as a bridge to bring the cultures and literature of the two nations closer.”\nThe event was moderated by Dr. Rabia Kiani.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
