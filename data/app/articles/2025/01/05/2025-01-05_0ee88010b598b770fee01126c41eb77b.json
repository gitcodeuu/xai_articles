Arbitrary arrests, economic hardships, and denial of basic rights have plunged the region into despair.\nThe APHC appealed to the international community to halt the ongoing genocide of Kashmiris and press India to resolve the dispute in accordance with UN resolutions.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
