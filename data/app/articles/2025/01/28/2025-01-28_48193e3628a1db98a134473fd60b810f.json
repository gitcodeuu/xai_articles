This will ensure that our future is in the hands of an empowered young generation,” the prime minister said addressing the inaugural session of the Commonwealth Asia Youth Alliance summit here.\nThe prime minister welcomed the participating delegates from several nations and said that as a founding member, Pakistan attached great importance to the Commonwealth and its institutions which served as an important platform for consensus-building and fostering partnerships.\nThe opening session of the international summit was attended by the delegates from 12 countries, federal ministers, diplomats, 113 new members of National Youth Council, students and academicians from across the country.\nWith over 60% of the Commonwealth population under the age of 30, the future rests in the hands of the youth. These hands must be empowered and equipped through vigorous training and access to modern technology. This will enable them to carve out a peaceful, progressive, and prosperous future.”\nHe said Pakistan with a youth bulge of around 70% of the population under the age of 30, fully understood the potential as the challenge could easily be transformed into great opportunities.\nEmphasising the undeniable role of youth in development, he told the international gathering that he always prioritized the productive employment of youth as a key focus area and devoted significant efforts to this goal.\nHe said that the government was committed to empowering youth through transformative initiatives such as the Youth Program empowering millions of boys and girls across Pakistan.\nReferring to his term as Punjab chief minister, Shehbaz Sharif mentioned the launch of the Punjab Education Endowment Fund to provide stipends to high achievers for education, the establishment of Daanish Schools which were now being expanded to Islamabad, Azad Kashmir (AJK), and remote areas of Balochistan.\nMoreover, around 600,000 laptops were distributed to high achievers which during the COVID time proved to be valuable sources for distance learning as well as earning. A fresh program had been launched for laptop distribution to high achievers from Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan (GB), and AJK, coming from humble financial backgrounds, he added.\nUrging the youth for dedicated efforts and contribution to nation-building, he advised, “Dream boldly, act courageously, work tirelessly, and have faith and spirit of conviction. Remember, it is you—our sons and daughters—who are the pioneers of our future. Through your knowledge and experience, you will unlock untapped potential, ensuring Pakistan’s well-being, progress, and prosperity.”\nEarlier, the prime minister also administered the oath to the members of the National Youth Council and gave away the Climate Champion Awards to 20 youth who had positively contributed to environmental preservation.\nIn his address, Chairman of Prime Minister’s Youth Program (PMYP), Rana Mashhood Ahmad Khan welcomed the guests from 12 countries and also congratulated 113 new members of the third batch of the Prime Minister National Youth Council (NYC).\nHe shared that 49 boys, as many girls, two transgenders and 13 candidates from overseas diaspora were selected through interviews conducted by a panel of professionals and leaders.\nThe PMYP chairman said that CAYA summit would provide an effective platform to strengthen the dynamic role of young leadership and facilitate dialogue.\nHe said that the establishment of the Commonwealth Asia Youth Secretariat was a positive development reflecting trust in Pakistan’s youth.\nTo promote the rich heritage and scenic beauty of the country, a video on Pakistan’s tourism potential was showcased in the event, captivating the audience with stunning visuals of the nation’s diverse landscapes.\nA video message from the Commonwealth Secretary-General Patricia Scotland was also played, who acknowledged the Government of Pakistan’s strides in youth development and its significant contributions to the Commonwealth community.\nThe event also featured the formal inauguration of the Commonwealth Asia Youth Alliance Secretariat in Pakistan as well as the SPARK Magazine of PM Youth Program.\nA session was also held on leadership capacity building, stakeholder management, and resource mobilization which discussed the issues like child marriage and other challenges, besides the youth empowerment.\nIshtiaq Ahmed, APP’s Foreign Editor, leads coverage of the Prime Minister, President and Foreign Office, bringing over 20 years of journalism experience from local and international publications – Reach out at 03335293238/ ishtiaqrao@gmail.com/ X: ishtiaqrao\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
