Notable achievements include the skill development of 1.1 million individuals and the reconstruction of 122,000 houses following the 2008 earthquake, supported by extensive data shared with the committee.\nIn response to inquiries from committee members, the CEO committed in providing district-specific details of projects, including funding sources and NGOs involved.\nThe Chair directed PPAF to submit comprehensive reports, including Google Maps locations of ongoing projects, and mandated that NGOs working under PPAF collaborate with MNAs and public representatives in their respective districts.\nThe committee expressed its dissatisfaction with the PPAF’s briefing materials and directed them to include comprehensive details on donor agencies against each ongoing project and address other omissions. The updates on these directives are to be presented at the next meeting.\nThe committee expressed concern over the absence of government audits for PPAF since 2020. While the CEO stated that PPAF no longer utilizes public funds, the Secretary of the Ministry of Poverty Alleviation clarified that, as a Section 42 company under the Companies Act, PPAF remains subject to SECP regulations and government audits.\nThe ministry has engaged the Ministries of Finance and Law & Justice to address the issue. The Chair directed PPAF to comply fully with audit requirements.\nBISP Chairperson Rubina Khalid briefed the committee on efforts to streamline payments through the RAAST system, with a pilot project expected to conclude by March 2025. Concerns were raised over unfilled Gazetted positions within BISP since 2011, with the committee emphasizing the need for immediate appointments to restore institutional memory. A formal recommendation on this matter will be forwarded to the Prime Minister’s Office.\nThe committee also discussed the financial challenges leading to early university dropouts. Members were informed that BISP’s Board of Governors discontinued scholarships through the HEC due to concerns over the selection process and recipient eligibility.\nThe committee directed BISP to devise a mechanism to ensure deserving students from BISP-listed families receive support, with a proposal to be presented at the next meeting.\nFinally, the committee urged for a detailed briefing from the Ministry on the Public Sector Development Program (PSDP) at the upcoming meeting, reaffirming its commitment for strengthening poverty alleviation and social safety initiatives across the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
