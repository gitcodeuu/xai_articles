Respectful and fair treatment of litigants, he noted, is essential for restoring public trust and showcasing the judiciary as a reliable and people-centric institution, so that the institution remains committed to reinforcing its role as a symbol of justice, fairness, and respect for all.\nThe session also addressed key areas of reform, including advancements in IT infrastructure, improvements in case management systems, capacity building for staff, and the introduction of training programs.
