  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 20 (APP): Senator Irfan Ul Haq Siddiqui has emphasized the universal connection of every Muslim to the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\nAddressing on Point of Order in the Senate Session here on Monday, he highlighted the importance of religious education, stating, “Even in the most remote areas, families ensure that their children are taught Quran and Hadith, whether at home or in nearby madrassas. This is a matter of honor for us, and no Muslim or Pakistani can object to institutions promoting religious education or the teachings of the Prophet (PBUH).”\nHe asserted that no government or institution has the authority to dismantle or oppose these religious institutions, calling such a notion unimaginable.\n“Thousands of madrassas in Pakistan are registered and functioning solely to provide religious education,” Siddiqui added, assuring that no madrassa had been shut down.\nCommenting on a specific institution under scrutiny, Siddiqui pointed to financial transactions from the UK linked to the trust. “I don’t wish to delve into the details, but one claim suggests the money belonged to the state, while another asserts it was Malik Riaz’s funds transferred to the trust’s account. I won’t engage in this controversy, but these claims raise significant questions.”\nHe questioned why Malik Riaz, a well-known businessman, allocated nearly 500 kanals of land to a trust that had only recently been established. Additionally, 240 kanals were reportedly given to a woman named Farhat Shahzadi in Bani Gala. “Why was this land given, and under what justification? If no favors were granted to Malik Riaz, why did he donate this land? These questions demand answers,” Siddiqui said.\nSiddiqui also criticized the irregularities in the Trust’s establishment, revealing that it was not registered under the updated Trust laws introduced in 2020.\nHe stated, “This Trust, based in Islamabad, is the only one that was not registered after the new legislation replaced the 1882 Act. It is unprecedented for such a case to emerge during any prime minister’s tenure.”\nHe concluded by challenging claims that no financial benefit was taken from the transactions, asking, “Hundreds of kanals of land—do they come free of cost in paisas, rupees, dollars, or pounds? This land has significant value and the matter warrants thorough investigation.”",
