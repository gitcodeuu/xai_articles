More than 1200 kidney and liver transplants have been performed successfully to date, with 75% of the patients receiving free or subsidized treatment, he added.\nHe said “institutions of global standards and international prestige like AKU and PKLI give us hope, bridging the gap between the many challenges we face and solutions we need, and empowering our healthcare system to evolve and respond to the needs of every citizen.”\nPM Shehbaz said “in today’s rapidly advancing world, the integration of modern technology, artificial intelligence, and tele-medicine into healthcare is no longer a luxury — it is a necessity.” “By embedding the best practices outlined in this manual into these advancements, we can revolutionize patient care, expand access to remote regions, and enhance outcomes for millions of Pakistanis,” he added.\nThe Prime Minister said he firmly believed that partnerships and collaborations between visionary institutions like Aga Khan University and the public sector were pivotal for transforming the healthcare landscape of Pakistan.\nShehbaz Sharif also congratulated the authors, researchers and contributors of this manual and said the AKU team’s hard work and dedication to improving clinical practices will have a lasting impact on Pakistan’s healthcare system. “These efforts are investments in our nation’s future — a future where every citizen, regardless of their background, has access to affordable healthcare.”\nHe said the Aga Khan University had established itself as a shining example of what can be achieved with vision, passion, and perseverance.\nEarlier, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif launched the AKU Manual of Clinical Practice Guidelines, a groundbreaking resource, tailored to Pakistan’s diverse healthcare landscape.\nThe launch event was attended by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar, Governor Sindh Muhammad Kamran Khan Tessori, Chief Minister Sindh, Syed Murad Ali Shah, Federak Minister for Finance & Revenue Muhammad Aurangzeb, State Minister for Information Technology and Telecommmunication Shaza Fatima Khwaja, Ms. Shaza Fatima Khawaja, Coordinator to Prime Minister on National Health Services on Regulation & Coordination Dr. Malik Mukhtar Ahmad Bharath, Chairman of the Aga Khan University Board of Trustees Dr Sulaiman Shahabuddin, Zakir Mahmood and President Aga Khan University (AKU) Dr. Sulaiman Shahabuddin, President of Aga Khan University (AKU).\nThis manual reflects years of rigorous research and dedication to address Pakistan’s lack of standardised clinical practice guidelines.
