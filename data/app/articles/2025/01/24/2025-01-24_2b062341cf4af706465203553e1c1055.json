This visit offers a valuable opportunity for Pakistani legislators to learn from the successful practices of Austria and Ireland in establishing PBOs. They play a critical role in independent budgetary analysis and effective parliamentary oversight. We remain committed to support the assemblies’ initiatives towards inclusive, transparent, and accountable governance in Pakistan.”\nThe visit is a pivotal step in advancing Pakistan’s legislative capacity, specifically in establishing an independent Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) to provide parliamentarians with professional, non-partisan, and in-depth analysis on the economy, budgetary and fiscal matters.\nYousaf Raza Gilani, Chairman of the Senate and head of delegation, said “This visit reflects the enduring and close ties between Pakistan and the European Union, highlighting our shared commitment to fostering democratic governance and addressing common challenges. By learning from the successful Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO) models implemented in Austria and Ireland, we aim to establish a framework in Pakistan that promotes transparency, accountability, and fiscal responsibility. This will empower our federal parliament and provincial assemblies with data-driven insights for more informed budgetary decisions. We extend our deepest appreciation to the parliaments of Ireland and Austria and their leadership for their invaluable cooperation and support. Their experiences will provide us with practical knowledge and best practices to guide the establishment of a PBO in Pakistan, strengthening our democratic institutions and enhancing responsible governance.”\nThe visit will focus on observing the operational models of the Austrian and Irish PBOs, both established in the last decade, to address critical challenges such as budget transparency and parliamentary independence. Austria’s PBO, established in 2012, enhances parliament’s role in budgetary discussions through independent expertise, while Ireland’s PBO, modelled on the Westminster system, provides a familiar framework for Pakistan’s legislators.\nMrs. Andrea Wicke, Ambassador of Austria to Pakistan, noted: “The establishment of PBOs strengthens the accountability and transparency of governance. We are delighted to host Pakistan’s delegation and share Austria’s journey in creating an independent budget office.”\nDeclan Johnston, Deputy Ambassador of Ireland to Pakistan (Chargé d’Affaires), emphasised: “Well-informed and quality independent advice and analysis is crucial in facilitating any parliament to fulfil its mandate. Ireland’s Parliamentary Budget Office was established in 2017, and provides independent and impartial information, analysis and advice to our parliamentarians as they address the pivotal economic questions and issues of the day. We are very excited to have the opportunity to share our experiences with Pakistani parliamentarians, as they similarly seek to deliver high quality and effective economic legislation and policy for their constituents.”\nThe parliamentarians visit aligns with Mustehkam Parlimaan’s objectives of supporting the National Parliament and Provincial Assemblies in legislative capacity-building, oversight enhancement, and inclusive governance.\nIt will also enable participants to develop an action plan for establishing a PBO in Pakistan, informed by best practices from Austria and Ireland.",
