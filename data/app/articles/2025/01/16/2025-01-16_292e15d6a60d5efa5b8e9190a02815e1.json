  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 16 (APP): Pakistan on Thursday welcomed the Gaza ceasefire deal reached on Wednesday, calling for its immediate and full implementation.\n“It is hoped that the truce would lead to permanent ceasefire and help in scaling up humanitarian assistance,” a Foreign Office statement said.\nIt said that the indiscriminate use of force by Israeli occupation forces had caused unprecedented loss of lives and property and displacement of hundreds of thousands of innocent civilian Palestinians. Israel’s expansionist designs have destabilised the entire region, it added.\nThe Foreign Office also reiterated Pakistan’s support for a just, comprehensive, and durable solution to the Palestinian issue, leading to the establishment of a sovereign State of Palestine based on pre-June 1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.",
