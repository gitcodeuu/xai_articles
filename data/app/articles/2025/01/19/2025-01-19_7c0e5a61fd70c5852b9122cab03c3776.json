The youth are the future of Pakistan, and by channelling their talents in the right direction, the country can effectively address its challenges.”\nGilani highlighted the importance of education in shaping Pakistan’s future and called on universities to play a pivotal role in equipping students for the demands of a rapidly evolving global landscape.\n“The world around us is changing fast. Technological advances such as AI, Machine Learning, Genomics, Internet of Things, Blockchain, and Quantum Computing necessitate our students to develop their faculties to match the new job market requirements,” said Gilani.\nHe emphasized the importance of cognitive, socio-emotional, and digital learning skills to ensure employability in this new era.\nGilani remarked on the transformation of Pakistan’s economic structure: “As we transition to a knowledge economy, we see a shift from traditional growth factors to building human and intellectual capital for a sustainable increase in GDP. The predominant source of influence in the modern world stems from information, intelligence, and insight rather than physical power or natural resources.”\nDrawing inspiration from renowned futurist Alvin Toffler, Gilani said, “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”\nHe urged educational institutions to be proactive in fostering critical thinking, innovation, and leadership in students, thereby contributing to Pakistan’s economic and social growth.\nGilani also emphasized the need for collaboration between the government, academia, and parliament to ensure that Pakistan’s youth are equipped with the tools to thrive. “We must work together – the academia, the parliament, and the government – to ensure excellence and innovation in education,” he said.\nHe remembered the services of the People’s Party in providing admissions to schools and colleges for Muslims living in India.\nHe further mentioned the improvement in the quality of education provided at Bahaiddin Zakaria University and said that hundreds of students were sent on fully funded scholarships abroad through Bahauddin Zakaria University.\nGilani quoted Pakistan’s founder, Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah, who famously said, “Pakistan is proud of her youth, particularly the students who have always been in the forefront in the hour of trial and need. You are the nation’s leaders of tomorrow and you must fully equip yourself by discipline, education and training for the arduous task lying ahead of you.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
