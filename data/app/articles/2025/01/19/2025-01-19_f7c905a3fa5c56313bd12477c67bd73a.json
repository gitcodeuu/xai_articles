Reports have indicated that water sports activities, along with boats and the litter left by participants, have contributed to the pollution of the water and compromised its quality.\nSohaib Abbasi, emphasized the importance of halting these activities to prevent further contamination and ensure a continuous supply of clean and safe water for both cities.\nHe also stressed the need to protect the dam’s ecosystem and maintain public health through the preservation of water quality.\nIn an update provided on Sunday, the EXN confirmed that the notice had been forwarded to the relevant authorities and that assistance from the local administration had been sought to enforce the order. With the deadline rapidly approaching, local authorities are expected to take immediate action if the notice is not followed.\nThe final day for compliance will fall on Monday, marking a critical point in the effort to safeguard the water quality of Khanpur Dam.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
