In countries like the United States, facilities such as the San Juan Islands Whale Watch operate under laws like the Endangered Species Act, offering rescue, rehabilitation, and long-term care to endangered species. Public donations, volunteering, and educational outreach are key components of these efforts.\nIn Europe, sanctuaries like the Veszprém Zoo in Hungary and Loro Parque in Spain benefit from regulations such as the EU’s Habitats and Birds Directives. These sanctuaries, supported by both public contributions and government funding, blend modern facilities with international collaborations to ensure species preservation. Global conservation success relies on the combination of legal protection, scientific research, and community involvement to safeguard endangered species in their natural habitats.\nAs the IWMB continues to make strides in animal rescue and rehabilitation, its work to combat wildlife abuse and trafficking has been pivotal. Bilal shared that over 500 animals have been rescued and rehabilitated since the center’s inception, with more than 100 species currently undergoing treatment and recovery. Despite the challenges posed by limited resources and professional expertise in the country, the IWMB remains steadfast in its commitment to providing exceptional care to the animals in its charge.\nThe IWMB urges the public to play an active role in protecting wildlife by reporting instances of animal cruelty. As Bilal aptly put it, “The health of our ecosystem depends on the welfare of our animals, and together, we can foster a more compassionate world for all living beings.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
