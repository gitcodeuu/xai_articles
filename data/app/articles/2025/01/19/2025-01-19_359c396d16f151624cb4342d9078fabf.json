Several notable dignitaries from different walks of life attended the ceremony.\nGovernor said that the book written by Amjad Siddiqui highlighted the burning issue prevailing in the country which needed to be addressed through tangible actions.\nSardar Saleem Haider Khan expressed deep concern over the alarming number of deaths of Pakistani citizens in the migrant boat accidents, which denounced the image of the country.\nHe emphasised that the human trafficking issue should not be viewed solely through the lens of poverty, adding that an individual who can afford to pay 5 to 6 million rupees for illegal travel could invest that amount in establishing a legitimate business within the country, thus securing a stable and prosperous future.\nHowever, he lamented that the country’s youth had lost confidence in the national system and stressed the importance of restoring that trust.\nThe Governor emphasized that the country was blessed with abundant of natural resources, which, if utilized effectively, have the potential to transform the country’s destiny.\nPointing out the person within the institutions assisting human trafficking, he said, the connections of these human traffickers within the institutes needed to be identified and all those involved in the heinous crime should be brought before the law.\nTo combat the root causes of human trafficking, Governor Khan suggested the inclusion of anti-trafficking content in school curriculums, alongside organizing seminars and discussions to raise awareness about the dangers and consequences of illegal migration. This, he argued, could help restore trust among the youth and guide them towards legitimate opportunities within the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
