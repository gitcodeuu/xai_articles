Despite the increasing adoption of solar energy, many consumers still find themselves paying high costs for electricity and are unable to afford the initial investment required for solar options.\nShe pointed out that while there are two main types of solar operations underway in Pakistan—1 Net Metering, which is enabling policy but faces unintended consequences, and 2 small consumers going off-grid, leading to an excess electricity supply—there is still a gap between public demand and policy implementation.\nSenator Rehman highlighted the importance of continuing to invest in renewable energy rather than relying on fossil fuels.She emphasized that the country’s solar market growth is crucial for sustainable energy development and must be enabled by sound policy.\nShe discussed how the public has moved faster on renewable energy, with the people’s actions now outpacing the policy measures in place.\nShe stressed that policy needs to catch up with the public’s transition to solar energy, ensuring that equitable and affordable electricity is available nationwide.\nShe stated, “Energy is what creates wealth for a country,” and emphasized the shift from the fossil fuel era to the renewable energy era as essential for Pakistan’s future.\nShe further noted the 200% increase in solar energy in the country, which has led to $2.1 billion in imports. Solar power is now being seen as a reliable daytime alternative to traditional electricity sources.\nHowever, she warned that solar energy investments should not be discouraged by policies that fail to adapt to the needs of consumers, especially the rooftop revolution that is taking place across the country.\nShe also praised the Power Ministry for its decision to retire 2000 megawatts of aging fuel plants, but added that Pakistan is still carrying a national energy surplus, which can be better utilized if solar energy policies are aligned with public needs.\nShe also highlighted the progress made by Sindh province, where 500,000 low-consumption households have been provided with solar kits, including LED bulbs, fans, and batteries, at a nominal charge of Rs 6,000.\nThis initiative is an example of how solar energy can generate goodwill and empower communities, but she emphasized that more needs to be done to ensure that everyone has access to affordable, reliable energy, particularly in the face of extreme weather events.\nShe warned that climate change will push many people into poverty unless equitable access to renewable energy is ensured.\nThe current climate crisis requires urgent action to remove barriers to solar energy adoption, such as bureaucratic obstacles, lack of financing, and unsupportive policies.\nShe emphasized that climate change will continue to affect vulnerable populations, and extreme weather events such as heatwaves and droughts will only increase in the future. With Pakistan experiencing temperatures of 50°C in some regions, the need for sustainable, affordable electricity is urgent.\nShe concluded by emphasizing that solar energy offers an important solution to the energy crisis and should be treated as a vital tool for economic development and climate resilience.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
