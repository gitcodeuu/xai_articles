Pakistan has a 9-10% share in global poverty, but the government is taking initiatives to improve living standards and has successfully reduced the rising pace of inflation. He also highlighted that the government has set a $35 billion target for remittances to boost economic stability.\nReflecting on Pakistan’s economic journey, the minister pointed out that from 1947 to 1990, Pakistan was on a strong growth trajectory despite limited resources.\nDuring that period, Pakistan’s GDP was 50% higher than India’s. He recalled that Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh once sought advice from Dr. Mahbub ul Haq regarding Pakistan’s economic policies. However, post-1990, India’s economy surged, growing 12 times faster than Pakistan’s due to policy consistency and economic reforms.\nHighlighting his own contributions to Pakistan’s education sector, the minister mentioned his 35-year tenure as a Board Member of FAST University and his role in establishing its fifth campus in Chiniot. He stated that he has learned from China’s education model, which prioritizes technical skills and innovation.\nThe minister reaffirmed the deep-rooted friendship between Pakistan and China, stressing that China’s unwavering support has been instrumental in Pakistan’s infrastructure and economic development.\nHe credited CPEC (China-Pakistan Economic Corridor) for revolutionizing Pakistan’s connectivity, trade, and energy sectors.\nHe said that China’s investment through CPEC has not only enhanced Pakistan’s transportation network but also created thousands of jobs and boosted industrial growth.\nHe also emphasized Pakistan’s strategic advantage due to its deep-sea ports, particularly Gwadar, which holds immense potential for regional trade.\nThe minister concluded by reiterating the need for policy consistency, investment in education, and industrial growth to follow China’s path of progress. He asserted that China is a true model for development, and Pakistan can achieve similar success by adopting its strategic policies.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
