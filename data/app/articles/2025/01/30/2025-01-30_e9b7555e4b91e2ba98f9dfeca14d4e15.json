  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 30 (APP):Senator Irfan Siddiqui, the parliamentary leader of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) in the Senate, on Thursday urged Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) to take advantage of the prime minister’s new offer for broader negotiations, following its (PTI’s) failure to capitalize on a valuable opportunity to address its demands.\nIn a statement on X, he criticized PTI’s unilateral withdrawal from the negotiation process, describing it as an undemocratic and apolitical move. He emphasized that this action had deprived the party of an important chance to resolve its issues.\nSiddiqui further emphasized that PTI must acknowledge that street protests, sit-ins, and long marches have not been effective in achieving their goals in the past and will not be in the future. He stressed that the key to solving any problem lies in serious and meaningful negotiations and urged PTI to realize this for the benefit of both the party and the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
