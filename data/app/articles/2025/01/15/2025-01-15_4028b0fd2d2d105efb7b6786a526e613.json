  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 15 (APP):Islamabad High Court (IHC)’s Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani on Wednesday underlined the importance for gender equality reforms in society.\nAddressing a seminar on gender equality, Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani said, “I am happy to see uniformed women present here at the event. We as Pakistanis could not understand gender equality as this concept could not be included in our attitudes”.\nHe said that if you live a day without your mother, wife, daughter and sister, then you will realize that the house cannot function without them. “Structural reforms have not been made on the level of equality of women. There are 3300 judges and 40,000 staff across the country”, he said.\nAddressing the ceremony, he further said that the Parliament has recently made the 26th amendment to the Constitution, as a result of which the Judicial Commission formed has only one woman.\nWas it not inevitable that women would also be equally represented in the Judicial Commission and that women would also be nominated at an equal level for the appointment of new judges, he questioned.\nJustice Kayani said that the Parliament and the judiciary are not doing anything for gender equality. When there will be no women in policy-making, then who will talk about gender equality, he added.\nIt remains to be seen whether women have the facility to take care of their children during duty, he noted.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
