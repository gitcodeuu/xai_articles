However, the government was working on several initiatives to reduce the burden on the common man.\nSardar Awais Ahmad Khan Leghari said advanced metering infrastructure has been introduced in all Discos and was being implemented in phases to ensure accurate billing and increased customer satisfaction.\nHe informed the House that the tariff was determined by NEPRA being the regulator and DISCOs implement the same in letter and spirit.",
