The property covers 4.6 acres and is classified as evacuee land.\nIt was stated that the property has three claimants and faces several encroachments. In the past, the lodge was used by the Foreign Office to host foreign missions and was even leased to the Brazilian embassy. In 1999, it was handed over to the Pakistan Public Works Department (Pak PWD).\nRegarding the legal situation, officials reported that six cases are ongoing in different courts. Recently, the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench sent the matter back to the Commissioner Rawalpindi to decide the case without delay.\nIt was decided that the Commissioner would hear all parties and review the revenue records to determine the rightful ownership based on merit.\nOnce the decision is made, strict action will follow, including criminal proceedings against those found guilty of misleading the courts and government offices through false claims and forged documents.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
