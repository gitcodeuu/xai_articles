  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 29 (APP):The Supreme Court Bar Association of Pakistan (SCBAP) has constituted a committee to assist the government on legal front regarding the illegal and unilateral suspension of Indus water treaty by the Indian government.\nIn a statement issued here today, the President SCBAP Mr Mian Muhammad Rauf Atta has said that the SCBAP remains steadfast in its role as a watchdog for the protection of fundamental rights, adherence to international treaties, and the preservation of national dignity and sovereignty.\nBeyond being a formal accord, the Indus Water Treaty of 1960 (the Treaty) is essential to Pakistan’s very existence and prosperity. The treaty that was mediated by the World Bank, expressly asserts that none of its signatories can unilaterally terminate, withdraw from, or hold it in abeyance. Yet, India has suspended this very treaty in contravention of international laws.  We view the unilateral suspension of the treaty as unnecessary move, aimed at disrupting the downstream water flow.\nIt is equally appalling to note that despite the lapse of considerable time, the guarantor of this Treaty—the World Bank— has failed to take any notice of India’s arbitrary action.  We urge the World Bank to remind India of her obligations under the Treaty. This pressing issue needs to be addressed immediately before the already deteriorated situation worsens further.\nAdditionally, we have yet to see meaningful efforts by the Federal Government to raise this matter at the appropriate forums. Nevertheless, we stand ready to provide assistance, solely on legal grounds. In this regard, a committee has been constituted under President SCBAP, along with Secretary SCBAP, Salman Mansoor, President Baluchistan High Court Bar Association, Mir Atta ullah Langove, President Sindh High Court Bar Association, Barrister Sarfraz Metlo, Barrister M. H Subhani and Mr. Hafiz Ahsan Khokhar, ASC.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
