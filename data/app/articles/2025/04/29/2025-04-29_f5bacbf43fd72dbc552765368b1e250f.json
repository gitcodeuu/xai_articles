A strategic road-map for the next 6 to 12 months will also be finalized, subject to the approval of the NEECA Board, with budget allocations being planned to support these initiatives.\nSpeaking on the occasion, the Managing Director of NEECA highlighted the significance of the partnership, stating, “Among all the MoUs we have signed, the one with NIBAF is the most important. This collaboration sets the foundation for technical assistance, joint product designing, and scaling up energy efficiency practices within the financial sector.”\nThe partnership will also involve collaboration with the Energy Conservation Fund (ECF), creating a tri-party alliance (NIBAF-NEECA-ECF) that is expected to bring a trans-formative shift in Pakistan’s energy and finance sectors within the next 3 to 5 years.\nThis MoU represents a strong step toward integrating sustainable energy practices into financial decision-making and institutional frameworks across Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
