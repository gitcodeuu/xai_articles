Through telemedicine, we can reduce the burden on hospitals and are working on a comprehensive strategy to implement this,” he explained.\nHe called upon the pharmaceutical industry to play a vital role in the promotion of telemedicine and offered full government support in this area.\nHighlighting the integration of technology into health systems, the minister announced a significant reform, “With NADRA’s support, the national ID number will now serve as a patient’s Medical Record (MR) number.”\nMustafa Kamal further shared an ambitious future plan, “Soon, we will be delivering doctors and medicines facilities to people’s doorsteps.”\nHe acknowledged the shortcomings in Pakistan’s healthcare system but reaffirmed the government’s commitment to leveraging technology for improved and accessible healthcare services.\nThe minister also stressed the government’s determination—both at federal and provincial levels—to eliminate counterfeit and substandard medicines.\nHe advocated for the implementation of QR codes to ensure the availability of safe, effective, high-quality, and affordable medicines to the public.\n“Fake medicines tarnish the reputation of our country and our companies,” Mustafa Kamal said, urging pharmaceutical companies to take strict measures in this regard.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
