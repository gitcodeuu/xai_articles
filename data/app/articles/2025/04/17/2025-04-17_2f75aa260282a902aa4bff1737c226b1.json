While on other hand, there was the PTI which had defiled the statue of Captain Karnal Sher Khan Shaheed for their own political gain.\nHe recalled his visit to Swabi after the chaos and anarchy of May 9, where he met Captain Sher Khan Shaheed’s brother Anwar Lala, and apologized for the disrespect shown to his great brother’s statue by the miscreants.\nLauding Captain Sher Khan’s bravery, the minister cited Indian Brigadier Mohinder Pratap Singh, who praised Captain Sher Khan’s valor and sent a letter with his mortal remains that states “This was a soldier whose bravery should be praised.”\nTarar said the PTI has been in power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa for 11 years, but failed to even establish a Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) force in the province, let alone Safe City project, or a forensic lab.\nNot a single project for the public’s welfare was initiated in KP under the PTI regime, he said asking why no attention was being paid to the health sector and law and order in KP.\nIf intentions had been good, development projects would be visible in KP today, he emphasized.\nHe said billions of rupees were given to KP under the National Finance Commission (NFC) award, but only the lip service is being done in the name of development.\nCommenting on the current state of PTI, he said that factionalism has taken roots in the party, with separate groups formed around Ali Amin Gandapur, Junaid Akbar, and Sher Afzal Marwat, that show the level of their sincerity both to the party and country.\nOn the other hand, the PML-N party is another name of home and family that supported each other in every difficult time. The brave, honorable, and loyal youth of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa have always kept the party’s flag high and fully supported PML-N in every difficult time.\nAttaullah Tarar paid tribute to PML-N leader Ikhtiar Wali Khan, saying that if anyone deserves to be called a “companion of difficult times,” it is Ikhtiar Wali, who defended the party in every challenging period.\nHe said during the by-elections held under the PTI era of fascism, the joy of winning one seat in Nowshera outweighed the happiness of winning 15 seats from Punjab.\nThe PML-N’s victory in the Nowshera by-election was a major success at that time, when opponents held their complete sway in the area, he noted.\nAddressing the youth, Attaullah Tarar urged them to consider themselves not merely political workers but part of an ideological mission.\nThe minister also highlighted measures taken under Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s leadership over the past year, such as economic recovery, reduction in inflation, and decrease in electricity prices.\nHe stated that international institutions are now praising Pakistan’s economy, which was only made possible through teamwork, vision, and sincere leadership.\nHe also praised the role of Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir for his contributions to the economic recovery.\n“We were on the verge of default,” he said, adding the prime minister had shattered the dreams of those who were betting on the country’s economic fallout.\nHe said the hosting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) meeting in Pakistan, the visit of 12 Prime Ministers to Pakistan, and the holding of global events like the Champions Trophy in Pakistan are a living proof that Pakistan is heading in the right direction.\nOn the occasion, he announced that every district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa would be visited to sensitized the public about the facts.\nHe urged the youth to come out into the field, go to their constituencies, and spread the message of PML-N.",
