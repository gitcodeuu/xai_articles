The meeting was attended by representatives from all provinces, relevant federal ministries, departments, and other key stakeholders.\nDuring the meeting, the Ministry of Human Rights shared progress on key action points, including the development of a Human Rights Due Diligence (HRDD) Regulatory Framework with UNDP, and coordination with SECP to improve labor rights and female corporate representation.\nA HRDD Compliance Checklist was distributed to chambers of commerce for feedback, and a national training program is being developed to raise NAP-BHR awareness.\nThe Ministry also participated in workshops with OPHRD to support ratification of international occupational health and safety conventions. Additionally, Provincial Steering Committees, District Vigilance Committees, and designated focal persons have been appointed to strengthen coordination on NAP implementation.\nProvincial representatives also shared progress updates on their respective action points.\nFederal Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar took particular notice of the distressing conditions faced by mine workers, where recent tragedies including fatal explosions and mine collapses have resulted in the loss of numerous lives.\nHe observed that these incidents reflect deep-rooted safety lapses and a lack of adequate regulation, despite the fact that mining remains a formal and recognized economic sector.\nThe Minister noted with concern that the sector continues to be treated informally in practice, with insufficient safety measures, absence of protective equipment, and limited access to training, health services, and compensation for mine workers.\nHe stressed the urgent need for a coordinated national response to close the gap between policy and implementation.\nWhile existing laws, including the Mines Act 1923 and related labour legislation, do provide for worker safety and rights, their enforcement remains inconsistent and weak. The Minister underlined the importance of aligning national standards with international best practices, particularly ILO Convention No. 176 on Safety and Health in Mines, and called for immediate improvements in inspection regimes, emergency preparedness, and employer accountability.\nHe further emphasized the need to empower workers through access to information and training on occupational rights, and reiterated the government’s commitment to ensuring social protection, medical care, and just compensation for affected families.\nThe Federal Minister further urged all provincial governments to develop an integrated and standardized Labour Management Information System (LMIS), drawing upon shared experiences and best practices to promote harmonization, transparency and improved coordination in labour governance across the country.\nThe meeting concluded with a strong reaffirmation of the collective commitment to uphold human rights in the business sector, enhance cross-sector collaboration, and translate the NAP-BHR’s vision into tangible, measurable outcomes for workers and communities across Pakistan.\nThe Committee also endorsed the NAP-BHR Implementation Plan for 2025–26, with a focus on financial transparency and improved access to justice.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
