Constructive engagement is the way forward.”\nExpressing deep concern over the current situation in Balochistan, the minister urged Balochistan National Party (BNP) chief Akhtar Mengal to return to the negotiating table. “Our brothers must prioritize the welfare of the people and reconsider their strategy of protest,” he said.\nMagsi reiterated that both the provincial government and state institutions are committed to addressing public grievances while maintaining law and order. “Politics will go on, but the state will fulfill its responsibilities,” he assured.\nHe also revealed that Senate Chairman Sadiq Sanjrani recently met with Akhtar Mengal, and that he himself had also reached out.\nReferring to the fluid nature of political developments, Magsi encouraged Mengal to review his decisions in light of the changing circumstances.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
