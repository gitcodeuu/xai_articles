However, he stressed that no compromise would be made on Pakistan’s sovereignty and terrorists would be dealt with firmly and decisively.\nThe Speaker National Assembly urged international human rights organizations and advocates to take notice of the grave human rights violations being committed in Gaza and Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nHe also highlighted the critical role of parliamentary diplomacy in shaping foreign relations, noting that as Speaker, he has consistently worked to portray Pakistan’s positive and pragmatic image on international platforms.\nReflecting on the political landscape from 2018 to 2021, he described the period as one of the bleakest chapters of political victimisation in the country’s history. He noted that, he remained committed to upholding parliamentary norms by issuing production orders for opposition lawmakers and extending invitations to the opposition for dialogue.\nAddressing the concerns of overseas Pakistanis, the Speaker emphasized that resolving the issues faced by the expatriate community must remain a foremost priority for Pakistan’s diplomatic missions, as they represent a key pillar of the nation’s economy and global stature.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
