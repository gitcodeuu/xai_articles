The Kalash community is a living treasure of Pakistan’s diverse heritage. Initiatives like this help ensure their traditions and knowledge systems are documented and celebrated.”\nCurated by Nageen Hyat, the project is the result of a unique three-part residency program, offering deep explorations into Kalash traditions, beliefs, and daily life.

Samreen Asif explored Kalash women’s stories through contemporary miniature art, and Ejaz Khan showcased stone carvings inspired by Kalash deities and architectural motifs.\nA key highlight of the event was the screening of “Rediscovering Greater Chitral,” a documentary produced by Nageen Hyat for PTV Global.\nThe film offers an intimate portrait of Kalash life, underscoring the cultural transformation underway in the region.\n“This exhibition is not just about art—it’s about awareness, preservation, and appreciation,” said Nageen Hyat, curator and founder of Nomad Gallery. “Our aim is to preserve and promote the beauty and significance of Kalash culture for a wider audience”, she added.\nThe exhibition also marks over 40 years of Nomad Gallery’s commitment to promoting contemporary art and empowering women and communities through crafts and cultural initiatives across Pakistan.\nRekindling: The Kalash Narrative will remain open to the public until April 30 at PNCA.\nThe visitors can experience this profound tribute to one of Pakistan’s most unique and cherished communities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
