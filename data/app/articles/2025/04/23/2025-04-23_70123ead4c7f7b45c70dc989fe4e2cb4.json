Such criminal elements will be brought to justice under any circumstances.\n“No individual will be allowed to illegally occupy citizens property. The very idea of grabbing someone else land will now be eliminated from Islamabad.”\nIf there is any complaint against the land mafia bring it to us. If your claim is legitimate then why do you need so many weapons, said SSP Shoaib.\nSSP Shoaib further said that, these people bring outsiders with no connection to the area to occupy land. If a police station fails to handle a case properly the matter reaches us through open courts. No one is allowed to sit on land with weapons. The presence of armed individuals in any area leads to a rise in crime.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
