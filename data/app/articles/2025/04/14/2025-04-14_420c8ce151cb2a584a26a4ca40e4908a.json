Ltd., highlighted private sector potential, “Investing in scalable waste-to-resource solutions can drive circular economies. Collaboration is key.”\nDr. Hamid Iqbal of Rawalpindi Waste Management Company (RWMC)noted: “Operational capacity must expand to serve informal settlements, where open burning is rampant.”\nDr. Samia Qadeer, Professor at Allama Iqbal Open University, urged that Pakistan needs a national household waste policy. Academia must support evidence-based reforms.\nZeeshan Ahmed from WWF-Pakistan warned: “Open burning releases deadly pollutants like dioxins, worsening air quality and accelerating climate change.”\nAfsheen Tajammul of 2Insects advocated for eco-entrepreneurship, Circular business models and formalizing informal waste workers can reduce reliance on burning.\nThe IoU and RAE will compile findings into a policy brief for federal and provincial governments, pushing for immediate regulatory action.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
