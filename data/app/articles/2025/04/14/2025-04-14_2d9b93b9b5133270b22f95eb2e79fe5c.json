  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 14 (APP): Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar on Monday reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm and longstanding position regarding the ongoing humanitarian crisis and genocide of innocent people in Palestine.\nDuring his address in the National Assembly on Palestine issue, he expressed deep gratitude to colleagues from both opposition and treasury benches who joined in a bipartisan effort to discuss the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza.\n“From day one, the people of Pakistan and the government of Pakistan—whichever government is in power—have maintained a clear and unwavering stance: we stand with our oppressed Palestinian brothers and sisters, and we will continue to do so. We strongly condemn this cruelty and barbarism in the strongest terms.”\nHe further emphasized Pakistan’s active role in providing humanitarian aid to the best of its ability, and its continued efforts to do more as the situation evolves.\n“In terms of relief, we are doing everything within our capacity. Moreover, when it comes to decisions made at the international level under international law for peacekeeping, you will find Pakistan at the forefront,” he declared.\nHe also emphasized Pakistan’s deep commitment to justice, peace, and solidarity with the oppressed.\nTarar emphasized the significance of October 7, 2023, calling it a dark day in modern human history due to what he described as a brutal and genocidal military campaign launched by the State of Israel against Palestinians, especially in Gaza. “This date will be remembered as a day of crisis,” he said, adding that the unprecedented level of violence and destruction marked a grim chapter in modern warfare.\nCiting figures based on international consensus, Tarar revealed that at least 65,000 Palestinians, including women, children, and civilians, have lost their lives over the past 17 months.\nHe noted that the actual number may be higher, with an estimated 150,000 people impacted by the ongoing Israeli aggression. He further stated that approximately 15,000 individuals remain missing, their remains buried under the rubble following intense bombings and the use of heavy explosives by Israeli forces.\nTarar lamented the silence of certain global powers in the face of what he called clear violations of international law, stating that history would remember those who chose inaction.\nHe praised countries and regions — including parts of Europe, the United States, Australia, Asia, and particularly the Islamic world — for raising their voices in solidarity with the Palestinian people.\nHighlighting a notable international effort, Tarar commended the South African government for taking the matter to the International Court of Justice, initiating legal proceedings to hold Israel accountable.\nReaffirming Pakistan’s consistent stance on the Palestinian issue, Tarar stated that the country has always supported the right to self-determination for oppressed peoples around the world, including in Palestine and Kashmir.\n“Dialogue can resolve these matters, not gunpowder,” he declared, adding that any resolution must align with international law and United Nations resolutions.\nHe criticized the escalating violence since October 2023, stating that despite global protests involving millions, the killings of innocent children, women, elderly, and civilians have continued.\nTarar expressed concern over the recent intensification of attacks and the increasing loss of innocent lives.\nHe also condemned disruptions to humanitarian aid, noting that hospitals, ambulances, and relief organizations are under attack, and even United Nations shelters are not being spared. “No condemnation is strong enough for such actions,” he said.\nTarar acknowledged Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s efforts in raising the issue on various international platforms — including the United Nations, OIC, and other multilateral forums — where he boldly voiced the concerns of Pakistan’s 250 million citizens and strongly condemned Israeli actions.\nConcluding his address, Tarar urged the world to take immediate steps to halt the ongoing atrocities. “We must not only stand by the oppressed people of Palestine in this critical moment but also intensify efforts toward a lasting solution to the conflict,” he said.\nPPP MNA Abdul Qadir Patel emphasized Pakistan’s long-standing and clear stance on the Palestinian issue. He criticized the lack of accountability in the National Assembly in the past, referencing a speech that hinted at recognizing Israel, for which the member faced no suspension or disciplinary action.\nPatel also pointed out the historical incident where a Pakistani political party supported an election campaign in the UK for a Jewish candidate, calling it a troubling contradiction amidst Israel’s continued oppression.\n“To call an OIC meeting, we need a leader like Bhutto,” Patel remarked, adding, “and becoming Bhutto means being ready to embrace sacrifice.”\nHe pledged full support for any parliamentary resolution on Palestine, reaffirming that the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) manifesto has always upheld the causes of both Kashmir and Palestine. He also took aim at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), blaming their policies for bringing the country to the brink of collapse.\nFederal Minister for National Health Services and Regulations Syed Mustafa Kamal recalled a previously passed resolution during the martyrdom of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, proposing two key initiatives including relocating Palestinian children to Pakistan for continued education and bringing the wounded for medical treatment.\n“At least 100 injured Palestinian families should be brought to Pakistan for treatment,” Kamal suggested. “When they return, they will become ambassadors of Pakistan.”\nIn response to an opposition inquiry, Kamal stated that no Palestinian is willing to abandon their homeland. “They prefer martyrdom on their soil. We must do something memorable for our Palestinian brothers,” he urged, expressing hope that by helping the oppressed, Pakistan would also receive divine mercy and assistance.\nIn his address, MNA Sahibzada Muhammad Hamid Raza, a prominent religious leader, expressed unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian people in these difficult times.\nHe called on the Government of Pakistan to intensify diplomatic efforts and pressure the international community to intervene.",
