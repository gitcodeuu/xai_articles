This remarkable contribution underscores the diaspora’s faith in the nation’s economic potential and their dedication to its progress.\nUnder the leadership of Nawaz Sharif, the Pakistan Muslim League (N) is delivering on its commitments to overseas Pakistanis, ensuring their trust and support.\nThis overwhelming response reflects their confidence in PML-N’s policies and their unwavering patriotism.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
