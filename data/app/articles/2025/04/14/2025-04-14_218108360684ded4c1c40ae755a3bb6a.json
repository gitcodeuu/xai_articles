Has the government provided alternate energy sources in cold areas?”\nThe government counsel informed the court that LPG is being supplied to Ziarat. Justice Muhammad Ali Mazhar then questioned whether any subsidies are being provided to the impoverished residents of mountainous regions.\nJustice Aminuddin Khan stated that it is the government’s responsibility to provide better facilities to the people, while Justice Mazhar pointed out that reports have been submitted since 2018, but no significant progress has been observed.\nJustice Hasan Rizvi noted that forest land in Sindh is being eroded by the sea, and Justice Mandokhail added that it is not the Supreme Court’s job to plant trees.\nThe Supreme Court adjourned the hearing indefinitely after directing the federal and provincial governments to submit their detailed reports.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
