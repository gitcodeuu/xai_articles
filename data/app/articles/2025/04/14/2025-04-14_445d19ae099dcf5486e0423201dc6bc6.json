It also acknowledges that the development of a country is directly linked to the well-being of its people.\nConfronted with competing public health priorities, limitations of health infrastructure, and a shortage of health professionals, Pakistan has struggled to adequately address its emerging mental healthcare needs.\nFor this reason, the Ministry has identified mental health as a key area under the 5Es National Economic Transformation Plan and has integrated MHPSS into the URAAN Pakistan initiative as part of Pakistan’s essential social and economic development plans.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
