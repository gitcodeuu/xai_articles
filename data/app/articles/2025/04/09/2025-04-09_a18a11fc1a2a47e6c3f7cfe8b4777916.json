There are different causes of maternal deaths in Pakistan, which will be addressed now to protect precious lives.”\nThe minister added, around 38 percent children under five in Pakistan are stunted due to malnutrition and other factors.” He added due to medical complications, these children have no role in society as stunted children fail to reach their physical and cognitive potential.\nHe assured to initiate innovative steps on emergency basis to address the country’s high level of stunting issue.
