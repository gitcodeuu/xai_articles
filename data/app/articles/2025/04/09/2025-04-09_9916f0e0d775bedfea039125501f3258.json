He said that the Directorate General Immigration and Passport acted on the NAB’s request. He did not include the name by picking and choosing on its own.\nThe contempt of court notice issued to the DG Immigration and Passport is illegal.\nThe court said that the appellant’s point is worthy of consideration, so notices are issued to the parties seeking their response. All records of the office application and contempt of court proceedings should be attached to this appeal.\nA show cause notice was issued on the recommendation to include the name in the travel ban list in continuous violation of court orders.
