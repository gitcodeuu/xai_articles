Among the dignitaries present were Sardar Shah Jahan Yousaf, Parliamentary Leader and Member of the Provincial Assembly (MPA) Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nWith over two decades of experience in rural development, Saibaan has a track record of implementing impactful community-based projects across Pakistan in collaboration with government institutions and international donors. The Jhandwal road project is expected to significantly enhance the quality of life for the local population by easing transportation challenges and increasing access to education, healthcare, and markets.\nThe newly paved road is expected to benefit approximately 2,700 residents, including 330 schoolchildren who will now have safer and more reliable access to their educational institutions.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Ambassador Akamatsu lauded the successful completion of the project and commended Saibaan for its commitment to grassroots development.\n“The pavement of this link road is not just an infrastructure achievement, it opens doors to opportunities, connects communities to essential services, and lays the groundwork for sustainable development,” the ambassador said.\nHe reaffirmed Japan’s continued support to Pakistan in its efforts to uplift underserved communities, emphasizing that such initiatives would further cement the longstanding friendship between the two nations.",
