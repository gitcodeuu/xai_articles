  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 09 (APP):Assistant Commissioner (AC) Muhammad Ali on Wednesday took swift action against a local petrol station, sealing the facility after receiving substantiated complaints of fuel shortchanging customers.\nAccording to a press released, following multiple consumer reports alleging that the petrol pump was charging full price while deliberately dispensing less fuel, Ali personally conducted an on-site inspection. Preliminary investigations confirmed systematic malpractice at the establishment.\nLocal residents had complained that the pump’s meter appeared to be manipulated, consistently delivering less fuel than what customers were paying for.\nThe deliberate underfilling constitutes a direct violation of consumer protection regulations.\n“We will not tolerate any attempts to cheat consumers,” Muhammad Ali stated during the inspection. “Such fraudulent practices harm both customers and the reputation of legitimate businesses.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
