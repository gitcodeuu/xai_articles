Funeral prayers will begin at 1:30 pm on April 6, 2025, at Islamabad’s Markazi Jamia Masjid in the I-8/3 sector. The Forum urged public servants and citizens to attend, calling his death a “loss to the nation’s governance legacy.”\nSarwar’s tenure spanned critical moments in Pakistan’s history, including shifts in media regulation and population control efforts. As Information Secretary, he oversaw state-run broadcasting reforms, emphasizing factual reporting and public access to information. Later, as Population Welfare Secretary, he advocated for community-based health initiatives, which colleagues say reduced misinformation about family planning.\nCondolences poured in from civil servants, politicians, and media professionals.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
