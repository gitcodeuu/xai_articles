It is the first batch under Prime Minister’s Initiative for Capacity Building of 1000 Agricultural Graduates in China, launched by Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif.\nThe programme envisages to train young Pakistani agricultural graduates at top Chinese institutions having expertise in key areas of agriculture, fisheries and livestock technology.

He underscored Pakistan is among the top 10 agriculture-producing countries of the world, adding that agriculture is the backbone of development in the country and there is a huge potential for growth of the sector.\n“Your selection lies a great responsibility upon your shoulders of exploiting this opportunity, learning the best practices in terms of better farm mechanization and utilization of the latest technology, and implementing them in Pakistan,” he underlined, while advising the outbound youth. He said that the training and exposure will equip the graduates with skills, enabling them to play their part in the development of agriculture sector in the country.\nMentioning how China made rapid progress and pulled its people out of poverty, he said political stability and persistency of policies are the imperatives leading towards a country’s progress. He said the Government of Pakistan envisions strengthening of the sector, as Pakistan has to emerge as a net exporter of agriculture products. He advised the trainees to take this opportunity as a mission, play the brand ambassadors of Pakistan in China, and work hard to live up to the confidence resided in them.\nThe initiative ‘Pakistan’s Prime Minister’s Initiative for Capacity Building of 1,000 Agricultural Graduates in China’ is envisioned by the Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif during his last year visit to Yangling Agricultural Technology Demonstration Base in Shaanxi province, China.\nShort term training course is designed to get orientation about the evolution of Chinese agriculture and lessons learned, visits of farm field and sites of private and public sector farms, labs and companies set up in China.\nThe graduates will also be engaged in hands on practical trainings through workshops in labs and receive class rooms trainings. Training progress of the trainees will also be evaluated and assessed for the acquired skills.\nHEC, in line with the guidance of Ministry of National Food Security and Research, ensured transparent selection following a rigorous process. Special emphasis was made on giving opportunity to the agriculture graduates from marginalized and far-flung areas including Balochistan.\nExpressing their views, the young graduates said that cost of foreign agriculture trainings was expensive which cannot be met without government’s patronage. They thanked Prime Minister for prioritizing and investing in capacity building of field, vital to Pakistan’s growth.\nThe enthusiastic Pakistani agriculturalists were eager to learn from the highly qualified Chinese faculty and, upon their return, apply their international exposure and acquired knowledge to tackle the pressing challenges of agriculture and food security.",
