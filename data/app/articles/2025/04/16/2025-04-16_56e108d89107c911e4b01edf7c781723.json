By converting this waste into usable textile products, Pakistan can reduce pollution and promote eco-friendly industrial practices.\nMr. Haroon Akhtar Khan issued clear directives for the swift implementation of the project, stressing its potential to provide substantial benefits to the SME sector.\nHe also termed it a timely opportunity for Pakistan to engage in global textile and fashion industry partnerships.\nHe noted that the Prime Minister’s “Uraan” initiative is aligned with this project, aiming to revive industries while ensuring environmental sustainability.\nReaffirming his commitment to institutional integrity and performance, Haroon Akhtar Khan declared a zero-tolerance policy towards inefficiency and corruption. “I need results,” he said firmly, indicating that any lapse in performance will not be tolerated and strict measures will be taken to ensure accountability and progress.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
