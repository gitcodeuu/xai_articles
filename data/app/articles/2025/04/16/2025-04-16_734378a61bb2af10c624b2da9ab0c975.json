He emphasized the importance of developing hatcheries, seafood processing facilities, and sustainable aquaculture farms to meet global quality standards and boost exports.\nReiterating the ministry’s commitment to maritime development, he said, “Pakistan’s long coastline remains largely untapped. The establishment of an aquaculture industry is key in enhancing food security and increasing our export footprint.”\nBoth sides agreed to continue coordination through relevant government departments and technical experts to develop viable models and policy frameworks for smooth project implementation.\nThis engagement, the minister noted, reflects a shared commitment to sustainable economic growth, environmental responsibility, and regional development through strategic investment and international collaboration.\nThe Ministry of Maritime Affairs remains open to business proposals aligned with Pakistan’s long-term economic and environmental priorities especially those that unlock the true potential of its maritime and coastal resources, the minister stated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
