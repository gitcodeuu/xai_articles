Under this system, access to a patient’s medical record from anywhere in Pakistan at any time will be possible.”\nHe said that the Ministry of Health and NADRA will work together to deliver healthcare services to people’s doorsteps.\nHe said that through telemedicine, doctors and medicines will be brought to patients’ doorsteps.\nMustafa Kamal said due to increasing population and pressure on medical services, healthcare centers are under stress.\nHe said that 70% of country people go to large hospitals for treatment instead of visiting basic health units.\nHe said that promoting digital health can make the health system more effective and sustainable.\n“This is the time to move beyond traditional methods and include digital health in our policies,” said Mustafa Kamal.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
