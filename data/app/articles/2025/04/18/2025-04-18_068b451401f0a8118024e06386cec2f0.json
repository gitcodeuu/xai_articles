Organisers said the fair would serve as a bridge between academia and industry, providing real-time employment opportunities for participants.\nThe olympiad will also include a Qawwali night, a live stream of TEDx talks, and a musical concert — elements that, according to organisers, reflect the event’s focus on combining innovation with cultural expression.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Metrix Pakistan Director Mohib Malik said the collaboration was aimed at creating a platform where young people could demonstrate their skills while gaining exposure to practical career paths.\n“NUTEC is not just a set of competitions — it is a comprehensive platform that promotes innovation, leadership, and inclusion. This partnership with FAST University is rooted in our shared belief in empowering youth and building a more connected, opportunity-rich ecosystem,” he said.\nUsman Abbasi of FAST University said the varsity was committed to nurturing talent and providing students with experiences that go beyond the classroom.\n“Our goal is to ensure students are equipped not only with academic knowledge but also with real-world readiness. With Metrix Pakistan’s support, we are scaling this event to new heights,” he said.\nThis marks the second consecutive year that Metrix Pakistan has partnered with FAST University for the olympiad. Last year’s edition, also co-organised by the two institutions, attracted widespread participation and was praised for its inclusivity and scale.\nMetrix Pakistan is a youth-based organisation working across rural and underserved regions of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It is considered one of the country’s leading platforms for promoting entrepreneurship, digital education, and youth empowerment.\nFAST University Peshawar, part of the NUCES network, is recognised for its academic rigour in computer sciences and emerging technologies. The varsity has become known for hosting events that foster creativity, critical thinking, and student-led initiatives.\nOfficials said they expect this year’s NUTEC to host a record number of participants, with registration already underway across campuses and institutions nationwide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
