Now it’s time they play a crucial role in Pakistan’s economic takeoff,” he said.\nIqbal highlighted Balochistan’s strategic importance and vast mineral wealth, claiming the province could become the richest in the country if its resources are properly utilized.\nHe stressed the potential of the Kachhi Canal to turn Balochistan green and committed to align all development projects with the needs of the common man.\nThe minister also announced that key infrastructure projects, including the Quetta-Zhob-D.I. Khan and Quetta-Karachi highways, would be expedited to boost regional connectivity and economic growth. He praised CM Sarfraz Bugti’s leadership and termed Balochistan a core partner in the Uraan Pakistan initiative.\nChief Minister Bugti said that the provincial government will work hand-in-hand with the federal government to complete projects aimed at uplifting the people of Balochistan.\nReplying to a question, Ahsan Iqbal condemned recent acts of terrorism designed to hinder development in the province, noting the tragic loss of 43 Frontier Works Organization (FWO) personnel on the construction of Gwadar Road.\n“Terrorists are targeting teachers, laborers, and civilians but we will defeat their agenda,” he declared, adding that unity is essential for progress.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
