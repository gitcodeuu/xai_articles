He said that martyred Wani sacrificed his life for the Kashmir cause.\nHe also expressed concern over the increase in human rights violations and illegal detention of the youth at the hands of Indian forces in occupied Jammu and Kashmir and urged the international community to come forward in a big way to stop India from killing innocent Kashmiris.\nThe ruthless suppression of dissent in the territory, he said, had resulted in the wholesale arrests and imprisonment of political workers, civil and rights activists. He said thousands of Kashmiris, including Hurriyat leadership, youth and activists, who have been arrested before and after 5th August 2019, have been languishing in different jails of India and the occupied territory.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
