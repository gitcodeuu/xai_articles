He was speaking at a ceremony in Islamabad where he launched a new Performance Management System for FBR officers.\n“If we want to move away from the International Monetary Fund (IMF), we must work hard to increase our revenues,” the prime minister said.\nHe said the FBR revenues witnessed an increase of 27% for which the entire FBR team deserved appreciation. However, he said this was a long journey and more work was needed to plug the loopholes in the system.\nThe prime minister commended the efforts of the finance minister, secretary finance, Chairman FBR and the entire team for launching such an effective performance system.\nHe also announced to replicate this system in other government institutions to promote the culture of penalty and reward aimed at improving the performance of the institutions.\nDuring his visit to the FBR, the prime minister was briefed on PRAL (Pakistan Revenue Automation Limited), digital invoicing, and the newly launched Performance Management System.\nHe also visited the newly established delivery unit of FBR and interacted with officers.\nThe prime minister was informed that a data-driven decision-making system was being introduced at the FBR.
