Iqbal’s teachings are rooted in the highest moral ideals—unity, Khudi (selfhood), sacrifice, liberty, and dignity. These principles offer meaningful direction to the Muslim world as it grapples with the tides of extremism, sectarianism, corruption, and economic stagnation.\nHe further emphasized the crucial role of the youth, urging them to draw inspiration from Iqbal’s doctrine of self independence.\nAyaz Sadiq said that  young people are  the future of the nation.\nHe stressed that aligning the younger generation with Iqbal’s ideals is vital to transform Pakistan into a resilient and propserous nation.\nAyaz Sadiq said that the message of Hakeem-ul-Ummat transcends boundaries of race, geography, and creed.\n“It is universal for a just and harmonious global order built upon the pillars of peace, tolerance, fraternity, justice, and spiritual elevation.”\nHe asserted that Dr. Allama M. Iqbal is not only a visionary for the Muslims of the subcontinent but also a fountainhead of wisdom for all humanity.\nHis poetry, rich with metaphoric meaning and philosophical depth, holds enduring relevance in addressing the existential crises of our times, he added.\nActing Speaker of the National Assembly, Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah said that Allama Iqbal’s philosophy of self independence and his  foresight remains a guiding constellation for the Muslim Ummah.\nHis teachings champion the causes of peace, unity, knowledge, and progress—ideals that can help the Muslim world rise above the turmoil of regional and global challenges.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
