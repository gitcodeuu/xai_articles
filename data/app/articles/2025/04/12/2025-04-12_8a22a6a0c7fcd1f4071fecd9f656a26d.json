He criticized the PTI’s IMF programme, blaming it for worsening the economic conditions of the masses.\nHe recalled that under Nawaz Sharif’s leadership in 2017, Pakistan had ended its reliance on the IMF and significantly improved the power sector. However, a political conspiracy toppled the government, pushing the country toward economic collapse.\nRana Mashhood praised the efforts of PM Shehbaz Sharif during his term to prevent default, calling it a selfless act to save the state. “Today, Pakistan is once again moving on the path to progress,” he stated.\nHe lauded Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz for launching daily relief initiatives and said the government was committed to fulfilling all promises made to the people during the elections. “Inflation is at its lowest, and the upcoming budget will bring further relief.”\nInternational investors were also showing interest in Pakistan’s mineral sector due to improved governance and investor-friendly policies, he added.\nThe rally, attended by hundreds, began at Shera Kot and concluded at Chauburji Chowk. Prominent coordinators of the PML-N Muhammad Akbar, Javed Sarwar Bhatti, Yamin Mughal, Moon Shah, and Waqar Bhatti were also present.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
