It served as a platform to review progress, exchange ideas, and shape future strategies under a shared commitment to inclusive education.\nThe ILMpact Programme, funded by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) and led by the British Council, aims to bring about a systemic change in access to school and quality of education.\nThe event brought together representatives from leading organizations, including Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI), British Council, Think Equal, NRSP, SRSP, ITA, Mojaz Foundation, Muslim Hands, Sightsavers, PAMS, and Pratham, all of whom contribute actively to ILMpact’s mission.\nSpeaking to the workshop participants, Farhat Hussain Farooq, the Additional Secretary of School Education Department, and Dr Syed Shabbir Zaidi, the Director of the Civil Services Academy, underscored the significance of institutional support in this initiative.\nThe workshop participants were given an orientation on: i) ILMpact’s MEL Strategy and LFA (operationalization and way forward), ii) MEL toolkit mapping with clear roles and responsibilities for each partner, iii) tools development deadlines (prioritization of urgently required tools), iv) dashboard orientation and update (reporting and tracking mechanism), and v) partners’ approach and MEL plans (team composition, responsibility matrix, and organization-wide integration of the project).\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
