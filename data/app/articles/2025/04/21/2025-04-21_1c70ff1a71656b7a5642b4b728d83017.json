Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar also played a key role in these efforts, he added.\nMinister Yousaf announced that, thanks to the endeavors of the Saudi Minister of Hajj and Umrah, an additional quota of 10,000 pilgrims was allocated to Pakistan. “Initially, Saudi authorities had indicated a quota of 102,000, but upon my request to reconsider sympathetically, they granted us an additional 10,000 slots,” he explained.\nHe clarified that this additional quota was specifically allocated to private Hajj operators and cautioned against misinformation regarding further increases in the quota. “Some people are talking about an even larger increase, but that is not accurate,” he emphasized.\nAddressing concerns about pilgrims who missed Saudi deadlines, the minister expressed optimism, “If Saudi Arabia allows pilgrims from other countries who missed deadlines, Pakistani pilgrims will surely also be accommodated.”\nHe stressed that any policy changes will apply equally to all countries, including Pakistan. “If pilgrims from other countries are permitted to perform Hajj despite missing deadlines, Pakistanis will not be left behind,” he assured.\nFinally, Minister Yousaf guaranteed that the funds transferred by Pakistani pilgrims to Saudi Arabia would be refunded if necessary, reinforcing the government’s commitment to protecting pilgrims’ interests.",
