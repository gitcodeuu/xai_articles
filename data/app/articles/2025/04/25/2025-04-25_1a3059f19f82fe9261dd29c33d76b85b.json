Small-sized Section 42 companies are also encouraged to adopt this practice to foster gender diversity and inclusive governance.\nTo assist applicants in preparing their submissions, the SECP has made comprehensive resources available on its website. These include a detailed checklist of required documents and a Guide on Licensing of Association with Charitable and Not-for-Profit Object Companies under Section 42.\nThese measures are part of SECP’s broader efforts to streamline regulatory processes, enhance transparency, and ensure efficient handling of licensing matters. The Commission remains dedicated to modernizing regulatory frameworks, promoting transparency, and facilitating the establishment of not-for-profit associations under Section 42 of the Companies Act, 2017.\nThe SECP is committed to fostering a well-regulated, transparent, and investor-friendly corporate sector.\nThese initiatives underscore its ongoing mission to improve ease of doing business and strengthen regulatory efficiency.
