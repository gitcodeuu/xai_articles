An investigation has also been launched to determine the cause of the fire.\nWith summer approaching, the CDA has increased surveillance in the Margalla Hills using advanced machinery and round-the-clock patrols.\nThe chairman urged citizens to avoid activities that could trigger fires, such as littering or burning debris, and to report emergencies to the helpline at 1122.\nPraising the efforts of all involved, Randhawa emphasized that the Margalla Hills are a vital part of Islamabad’s identity and ecosystem.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
