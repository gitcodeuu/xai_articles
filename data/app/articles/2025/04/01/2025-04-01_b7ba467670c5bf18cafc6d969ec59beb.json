At the occasion, Senator Mir Kabir Muhammad Shahi was also present.\nThe meeting covered extensive discussions aimed at formulating long-term solutions to the issues facing Balochistan.\nBoth sides agreed that, while border management and equitable distribution of resources are critical provincial issues, they cannot take precedence over public safety and the tranquility of the citizens of Balochistan.\nThere was a shared concern about the lack of seriousness from other mainstream political parties regarding the issues in Balochistan. They emphasized that any narrow or tunnel-vision approach to these matters would ultimately lead to a dead end.\nThey stressed that the only viable solutions for Balochistan’s challenges lie within democratic frameworks and a political approach.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
