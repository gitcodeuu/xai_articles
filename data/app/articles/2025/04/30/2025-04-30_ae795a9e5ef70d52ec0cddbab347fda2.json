The discussion, titled “How Rupee Bonds Can Power Pakistan’s Recovery,” explored the critical need for expanding the domestic bond market, reducing reliance on external debt, and enabling financial resilience through local currency financing.\nAnother key highlight of the seminar was the panel discussion on “Creating a Green Financing Ecosystem: Integrating Credit Enhancements and Financial Instruments.” The session featured insights from Claudine Lim, Director,\nInfraZamin Board; Khalida Habib, Executive Director at SECP; Rizwan Ahmed, GM and CEO of Saudi Pak Industrial and Agricultural Investment Company; and Imtiaz Gadar, CFA, CEO of Al Meezan Investment Management Ltd.  The discussion focused on embedding credit guarantees into sustainable financing products and enabling long-term investments in green infrastructure.\nPanelists emphasized the role of financial innovation in supporting Pakistan’s transition to a greener, more resilient economy.\nDevelopment Director at the British High Commission Jo Moir said: Pakistan has a unique opportunity to lead in sustainable development by using global green finance trends and innovative financial tools. The UK is supporting Pakistan with technical expertise and financial partnerships to help create a greener, more resilient future.\nBoo Hock Khoo, drawing on his extensive global experience in credit enhancement and infrastructure finance, noted that “Development of green financing via local capital markets is a powerful step forward for the country. InfraZamin’s efforts in providing credit guarantees on bond instruments are key to building investor confidence and enabling scalable, climate-aligned infrastructure in Pakistan.\nThe SECP’s leadership in fostering a regulatory framework that supports these developments is highly commendable and encouraging.”\nInfraZamin CEO Maheen Rahman shared insights from the organization’s recent initiatives, including the launch of South Asia’s first gender that till date, has empowered approximately 30,000 women through micro-infrastructure development.\nShe also discussed the Agri-Infrastructure Sukuk with Unity Foods, a Rs. 2 billion Shariah-compliant instrument aimed at modernizing agricultural facilities and promoting renewable energy.\nThese projects exemplify InfraZamin’s commitment to leveraging credit guarantees to attract private investment into underserved sectors.\nWaqas ul Hasan, CEO Karandaaz Pakistan, highlighted the organization’s role in strengthening the green financing ecosystem and its contribution to mobilizing the debt capital market. He stated, “Green finance is no longer a choice — it is an imperative.\n“Sustainable economic progress depends on mobilizing capital toward climate-resilient and environmentally responsible investments. We see InfraZamin, in partnership with regulators and the financial sector, as central to unlocking the full potential of Pakistan’s debt capital market. Together, we are working to accelerate private sector participation in green infrastructure and financial innovation, laying the foundation for a more resilient, inclusive, and sustainable future for Pakistan” he said.\nPhilip Skinner, discussed the role PIDG has played in mobilizing private capital for sustainable financing.\nHe presented case studies—most notably Acorn, East Africa’s first-ever green bond, which financed green, safe, and affordable student accommodation in Nairobi. Phil stressed that “Encouraging green financing through capital markets is a critical component of Pakistan’s response to financing its climate investment need. Certifying issuances as green helps build market capacity to understand climate risk and increases market attractiveness to foreign investors.”\nThe speakers  called for urgent need to deepen Pakistan’s green financing ecosystem by leveraging debt capital markets. Stakeholders emphasized the importance of continued collaboration between the public and private sectors to introduce innovative financial instruments, strengthen credit enhancement frameworks, and unlock long-term capital for sustainable infrastructure development.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
