  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 30 (APP):The Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) has reduced the price of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) for May 2025, following a decline in international market rates.\nAccording to an official notification, the price of an 11.8 kg domestic LPG cylinder has been reduced by Rs. 37.80, bringing it down from Rs. 2,930.71 in April to Rs. 2,892.91.\nThe price cut comes in response to a 1.8 percent decrease in the Saudi Aramco Contract Price (CP), which is used as a benchmark for local LPG pricing. However, a slight increase of 0.22 percent in the average US dollar exchange rate partially offset the overall reduction.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
