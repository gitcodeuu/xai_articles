The world is appreciating Pakistan’s role in regional and global peace today.”\n“Pakistan’s leadership has always raised its voice strongly for global peace and justice. Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto took a bold stand for the rights of developing countries and world peace, while Shaheed Benazir Bhutto dedicated her life to peace, democracy, women’s rights and the eradication of extremism across the world,” he recalled adding “Their vision that peace and justice are the foundations of sustainable development, still guides us today.”\n“Pakistan believes that peace is possible only when there is justice and equality among all nations. The decades-long deprivations of the people of Palestine and occupied Jammu and Kashmir are shaking the global conscience. Without the right to self-determination in these regions, world peace is incomplete,” he stressed.\nHe said, “Pakistan takes pride in the fact that it always actively participated in the advancement of world peace.”\n“Our long service in UN peacekeeping missions, providing of humanitarian assistance to countries affected by natural disasters and conflicts, and supporting dialogue and cooperation at the global level are part of this commitment,” he continued.\nHe said, “Today’s youth are facing some of the greatest challenges in human history, such as growing global conflicts, extremism, climate change, economic inequality, and the spread of misinformation in the digital age.”\nPresident Zardari said, “We must empower our youth so that they embrace the values ??of peace, tolerance, and dialogue, and lead the world towards a more secure and just future.”\n“I pray to Allah Almighty to illuminate the world with the true light of peace, justice, and mutual respect. Amen,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
