He added that Pakistan was proud of its role in safeguarding the Haramain Sharifain.\nHe said the recent visit of President Asif Ali Zardari to China would yield significant benefits, as past engagements with Beijing had strengthened bilateral ties. He recalled China’s steadfast support for Pakistan during the Indo-Pak war, describing the country as a time-tested friend.\nThe governor also praised Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari’s efforts on the diplomatic front, stating that his leadership at international forums, including in Saudi Arabia, helped enhance Pakistan’s global image and restore the value of the green passport.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
