As President Zardari noted, since its founding, the CPC has been unswervingly dedicated to pursuing happiness for the Chinese people and rejuvenation for the Chinese nation.”\nHe said particularly since the 18th National Congress of CPC, under the leadership of President Xi Jinping and the guidance of Xi Jinping thought on socialism with Chinese characteristics for a new era, the cause of the party and the country has achieved historic millstones, and the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation has entered an irreversible historical process.\nHe said that currently, both China and Pakistan are in a critical phase of development and rejuvenation, and both are dedicated to fulfilling their people’s aspirations for a better life.\nHe said China is willing to further strengthen exchanges on governance experience with Pakistan, draw wisdom from each other’s development journeys, and work together to embark on a new journey toward modernization.\nDuring his stay in Shanghai, President Zardari experienced the vibrant vitality of this modern metropolis firsthand.
