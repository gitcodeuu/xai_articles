Your thundering demand for self-determination, accountability for war crimes, and an end to occupation echoed from Srinagar to Gaza,” Wani wrote on his X handle, says a press release received here from Geneva.\nApplauding Pakistan’s bold diplomatic posture, he remarked: “Diplomacy with spine—Pakistan stands taller.”\nHe expressed heartfelt gratitude to the people and government of Pakistan for their unwavering support to the Kashmir cause and fearless advocacy of the Kashmiris’ inalienable right to self-determination.\n“Be it Kashmir or Palestine, Pakistan has consistently championed these just causes at every international forum,” he said, adding that Islamabad’s principled stance on these long-standing disputes reflects its unshakable commitment, solidarity, and deep sense of brotherhood with the oppressed people of Kashmir and Palestine.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
