He pointed to ongoing policy measures, regulatory reforms, and investment in modern technology as key enablers of the port’s progress.\nThe minister also lauded the contribution of private operators, particularly DP World’s Qasim International Container Terminal (QICT), whose management, he said, had ensured that operations at Port Qasim were maintained at international standards. He further announced that the Ministry of Maritime Affairs had cleared a long-awaited dredging project for the port channel to accommodate larger vessels, enhancing trade handling capacity.\nChairman PQA, Rear Admiral Moazzam Ilyas (Retd), echoed the minister’s views, attributing the success to the dedication and teamwork of the port’s workforce.\n“This acknowledgment by the World Bank is a testament to the commitment of the entire PQA team,” Ilyas said. “We will continue to invest in innovation, digitalization, and infrastructure to further elevate our global standing.”\nJunaid Chaudhry said this recognition comes at a time when we are seeking to position Pakistan as a strategic logistics corridor linking the Middle East, Central Asia, China, and beyond”, the minister said adding, with both Karachi Port and Gwadar Port also undergoing modernization,  the rise of Port Qasim on the global index strengthens the country’s credentials as a regional shipping hub.\nThe minister noted that improved port performance is likely to attract foreign investment in maritime and logistics industries, while providing exporters and importers with more reliable and cost-efficient shipping options.\nJunaid Anwar Chaudhry said the government’s next focus would be on integrating ports with inland transport networks, expanding digital systems, and ensuring environmental sustainability in maritime operations.\n“This achievement is only a beginning,” the minister added. “Our aim is to transform Pakistan’s maritime gateways into drivers of economic growth, regional integration, and prosperity.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
