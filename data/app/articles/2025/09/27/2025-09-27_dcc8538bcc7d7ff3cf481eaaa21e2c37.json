If developed wisely, these resources can bring unprecedented growth to the tourism sector and contribute meaningfully to our national economy,” he said.\nHe stressed that in the face of climate change, environmental degradation, and economic challenges, sustainable development is no longer optional but necessary.\n“Tourism must not only serve as an engine of economic growth but also as a tool for safeguarding our environment and protecting our cultural legacy. We must ensure that these treasures remain intact for future generations to experience and cherish,” he emphasized.\nThe PTDC chief also issued a special appeal to tourism stakeholders, industry professionals, and entrepreneurs to adopt eco-friendly practices and innovative models of sustainable tourism.\nHe highlighted the role of community-based tourism, responsible travel initiatives, and the integration of modern technology in creating a resilient and inclusive tourism ecosystem.\nPakistan has already been witnessing a gradual rise in both domestic and international tourism in recent years, particularly in the northern areas such as Gilgit-Baltistan, Hunza, Skardu, and Swat.\nThe government has also initiated projects to improve tourism infrastructure, facilitate investment, and promote Pakistan’s image as a safe and attractive destination on the global stage.\nHowever, Rana pointed out that more coordinated efforts are required to ensure long-term impact.\n“World Tourism Day reminds us that tourism is not just about leisure and recreation. It is about building bridges among people, strengthening economies, and preserving the environment. If we want tourism to serve as a true engine of progress, sustainability must remain at the heart of every initiative,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
