However, he stressed that Pakistan’s preference for peace must not be misinterpreted as weakness.\nSimilarly, the Prime Minister’s unequivocal support for the Palestinian cause earned him praise from political observers. “The commitment to an independent Palestinian state with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital sends a strong diplomatic message to the international community,” said Dr. Khurshid.\nThe Prime Minister’s address did not overlook the growing security threats posed by foreign-sponsored terrorist groups operating across Pakistan’s western border, particularly from within Afghanistan.\nHe commended the speech’s clarity in highlighting these threats, stressing the need for international cooperation to tackle terrorism.\nPM Shehbaz Sharif also recalled Pakistan’s immense sacrifices in the war on terror, citing over 90,000 lives lost and $150 billion in economic damage. His remarks served as a reminder of Pakistan’s frontline role in maintaining global security and combating extremism.\nIn addition to political and security matters, the Prime Minister devoted significant attention to climate change which is a critical issue for Pakistan, which ranks among the countries most vulnerable to climate-induced disasters.\nFormer Conservator of Forests Niaz Khan lauded the Prime Minister for calling upon the international community to take urgent and collective action.\n“Declaring a climate emergency was a bold and timely move,” Niaz Khan said. He urged wealthier nations to provide financial and technical support to help Pakistan build resilience against future environmental catastrophes, such as the catastrophic floods that affected millions in Pakistan.\nThroughout his address, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif positioned Pakistan as a responsible global actor committed to peace, diplomacy, and multilateralism. He emphasized the need for equitable partnerships, fair economic cooperation, and a renewed commitment to the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.\n“Pakistan stands for peace not only in South Asia but across the globe,” the Prime Minister stated, calling on world leaders to resolve conflicts through diplomacy and dialogue rather than force and coercion.\nObservers agreed that the Prime Minister’s address has served to reposition Pakistan on the global stage as a peace-seeking, resilient, and forward-looking nation.\nThe speech’s balanced tone combining firm principles with calls for collaboration has been praised for reflecting the collective aspirations of the Pakistani people while reinforcing the country’s stance on vital global issues.\nAs Professor Dr. Shahjehan put it, “This was not just a speech rather it was a moment of national affirmation and international re-engagement. It signaled Pakistan’s intent to lead with responsibility, dignity, and vision.”\nWith growing global attention and praise for Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s address, analysts believe Pakistan has taken a significant diplomatic step toward redefining its role in an increasingly multipolar world.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
