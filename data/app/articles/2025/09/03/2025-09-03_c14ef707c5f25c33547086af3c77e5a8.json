It represents one of the world’s largest and youngest consumer markets,” Baker noted. “Pakistan’s GDP stands at $412 billion, ranking 38th globally, but projections by Goldman Sachs suggest it could grow to $3.3 trillion by 2050, positioning it among the top 10 to 15 economies worldwide.”\nShe highlighted several sectors primed for U.S. investment, including critical minerals, information and communications technology, agriculture, energy, and infrastructure development.\nBaker also encouraged American companies to partner with the U.S. Foreign Commercial Service team at U.S. Mission Pakistan and explore joint ventures with local counterparts.\n“Let’s seize this moment to create profitable opportunities for U.S. businesses, contribute to shared economic prosperity, and strengthen the bonds between our two nations,” she concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
