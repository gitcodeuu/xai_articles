According to him, this mechanism remains the most effective way to guarantee timely support.\nRecalling his tenure as Foreign Minister during the PDM government, Bilawal said a housing programme for flood victims was launched at that time, and stressed that similar initiatives were now required from both federal and provincial governments to provide shelter and stability to displaced families.\nHe also praised the role of the Punjab media in highlighting the plight of flood victims and promoting a spirit of humanitarian service through positive reporting.\nBilawal said all institutions engaged in relief and rescue operations deserved appreciation for their sincerity and dedication. “If shortcomings are noticed, they must be pointed out, but so far no major flaws have been observed in the ongoing efforts,” he added.\nThe PPP Chairman further stressed that moments of natural calamities demanded unity beyond political differences. “Serving the people must always remain the top priority,” he remarked.\nOn this occasion, Punjab Governor Saleem Haider, Members of the National Assembly Abdul Qadir Gilani, Ali Qasim Gilani, Irshad Sial, and other PPP leaders were also present.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
