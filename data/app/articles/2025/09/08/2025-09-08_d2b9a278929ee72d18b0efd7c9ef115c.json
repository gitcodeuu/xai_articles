The first phase of this deal is envisaged at approximately $500 million of investments into Pakistan’s critical minerals sector.\nThis collaboration further strengthens the enduring bilateral relationship between Pakistan and the United States, while unlocking new opportunities for sustainable growth, technology transfer, and job creation.\nThe next steps for the MoU include forming dedicated teams to explore the full potential of Pakistan’s vast resource base, identifying critical minerals for immediate export, and building an anchor position for a long-term partnership in exploration, extraction, and processing.\nImportantly, the cooperation will prioritize sustainability, profitability, and environmental responsibility to ensure benefits for the people of both nations.\nIn addition, both parties will also explore innovative financing and digital solutions such as tokenisation of critical minerals, enabling global investors to participate in Pakistan’s mineral wealth and further accelerating transparency, liquidity, and value creation across the sector.\nSimilarly, the National Logistics Corporation of Pakistan signed an MoU with Mota-Engil Group which is a global leader in engineering and construction and is actively working on new opportunities to expand its footprint across West Asia.\nThe current survey of opportunities in Pakistan aims to identify priority markets where Mota-Engil can align with government visions and private sector initiatives.\nThe Group seeks to build long-term partnerships that leverage its global know-how while creating value locally through job creation, technology transfer, and sustainable development.\nThe visit of the delegation and signing of the aforementioned MoUs mark a milestone in Pakistan’s efforts to attract global investment in the mining and logistics sectors.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
