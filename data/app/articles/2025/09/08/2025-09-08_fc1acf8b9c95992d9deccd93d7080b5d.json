  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 08 (APP):The Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) organized a Mehfil-e-Milad on Monday with deep respect and devotion to commemorate the birth of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).\nThe event was arranged in collaboration with the BISP Administration, the All Pakistan Employees Welfare Association, and the Officers Association.\nA large number of BISP officers and staff participated in the gathering.\nChairperson BISP Senator Rubina Khalid attended the event along with Additional Secretary Dr. Asmat Nawaz, Directors General, and other officers and staff.\nDuring the Mehfil, BISP staff members recited Naats. This was followed by a speech from Mufti Gulzar Ahmad Naeemi, Principal of Jamia Naeemia, who highlighted various aspects of the life of the Holy Prophet (PBUH). He emphasized that the Prophet (PBUH) promoted compassion, upheld the rights of women, and spread a message of peace across the world.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Chairperson Rubina Khalid said that both in our personal and professional lives, we must embody three key values: mercy, selflessness, and tolerance—core teachings from the life of the Prophet (PBUH).\nShe reminded the BISP staff that their foremost responsibility is to serve the poor and deserving with dignity and empathy.\nShe added that our assistance must be heartfelt, not performative. “Many families may not ask for help, but they wait silently. We must reach them with compassion and respect,” she said.\nSenator Rubina Khalid also shared details of her recent visits to flood-affected areas in Swat, Buner, and Swabi, expressing concern over the challenging conditions faced by affected families. She stressed the need to stand in solidarity with them during these difficult times.\nThe Mehfil concluded with the recitation of Durood and Salam, followed by a special prayer for the peace, safety, and prosperity of Pakistan and BISP.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
