The window for action is short and closing fast,” he stressed.\nDr. Banuri underlined that despite decades of climate policies including the National Climate Change Policy (2012), its implementation framework (2013), and the Climate Change Act (2017), Pakistan has fallen short of achieving key climate targets.\nChief Coordinator to the Prime Minister for Government Performance and Innovation, Mosharraf Zaidi, contributing to the discussion, underscored that policymaking should be rooted in securing people’s lives, livelihoods, and dignity. He argued that Pakistan’s challenge is not the absence of frameworks but the failure to create institutions capable of delivering results at the grassroots level.\nIn response to a question on regional models, Dr. Banuri pointed to Bangladesh’s “living with floods” strategy as an example of pragmatic adaptation, suggesting that Pakistan too must embrace innovative and inclusive approaches.\nHe concluded with a strong call for building strong, independent institutions, investing in education and research, and shifting from short-term transactionalism to long-term resilience planning.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
