He noted that the nation has sent an unmistakable message: there is no room for hatred and disorder in Pakistan’s political landscape.\nHighlighting the absence of youth participation, once considered a strong support base for PTI, Abbasi remarked that “even with a telescope, the ‘youthiyas’ were nowhere to be found,” describing the protest call as a complete failure.\nThe minister further stated that Pakistan is now recognized globally as a dignified and forward-moving nation, with a confident economic trajectory. He asserted that no one would dare challenge the country’s sovereignty again.\nConcluding his remarks, Abbasi said the nation has permanently rejected the politics associated with the PTI founder, affirming that Pakistan’s future lies in development, unity, and long-term stability.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
