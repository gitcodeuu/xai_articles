He praised the courage and unity demonstrated by both the armed forces and the public in responding to the enemy’s aggression, stating that such bravery elevated the nation’s honour. He emphasized that “Pakistan is a reality no power in the world can afford to ignore.”\nIn his presidential address, Prof. Dr. Nasir Mahmood stated that the victories of nations are rooted in strong institutions and unwavering determination. He highlighted that Pakistan is an ideological state, whose people stand shoulder to shoulder with their armed forces in defending both its ideological and geographical frontiers.\nThe keynote speaker, Major General (Retd.) Dr. Samrez Salik, Hilal-e-Imtiaz (Military), underscored that despite the many challenges faced after Pakistan’s creation, the nation and its military have achieved remarkable successes through courage and resilience. Referring to the “Battle of Truth,” he noted that although the battle seemed to last only hours, it was the result of years of preparation and hard work. He also emphasized that the sacrifices made by the Pakistan Army in the war against terrorism will forever be remembered.\nAnother distinguished speaker, Air Vice Marshal (Retd.) Sarfaraz Khan, Sitara-e-Imtiaz (Military) and renowned defence analyst remarked that the enemy misjudged Pakistan’s strength and launched a cowardly attack under the cover of night. However, Pakistan’s armed forces, particularly the air force, responded decisively within minutes and inflicted a humiliating defeat on the aggressor. He added that the heroic feats of September 6, 1965, and May 2025 remain a source of national pride.\nIn the closing session, Prof. Dr. Muhammad Saleem Mazhar, Director General of the NLPD, expressed gratitude to all the guests and highlighted that the timeless victory of the “Battle of Truth” elevated Pakistan’s global stature.
