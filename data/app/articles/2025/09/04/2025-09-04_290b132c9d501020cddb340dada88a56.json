  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 4 (APP):There is a pressing need for the development and implementation of a comprehensive Biodiversity Conservation Action Plan to safeguard diverse plant species on the verge of extinction in Tharparkar.\nExperts highlighted that these plant species are facing a threat due to overgrazing, expansion of unsustainable agriculture, and excessive extraction of commercially and medicinally valuable plants to protect the area’s unique and critically endangered plant biodiversity, Pakistan’s first desert-region Flora Conservation Station has been launched in Thar Coal Block II on Thursday, said a press release issued here Thursday.\nSet up under the Partnership for Biodiversity Conservation in Thar, this conservation station has been established by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), in collaboration with Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC) and Thar Foundation.\nWith implementation support from local partner Baanhn Beli, the Flora Conservation Station builds on four years of IUCN-SECMC partnership and rigorous scientific research, which has included globally critically endangered vulture conservation efforts, ecological surveys, sustainable saline agriculture and saline aquaculture, and environmental education programs. This facility enhances their ongoing efforts in Thar for conservation and propagation of indigenous plants, restoration of degraded rangelands, and safeguarding ecosystems that are essential for the livelihoods of local communities.\nMany of these species were documented during IUCN’s ecological baseline survey (2020–2022), which recorded more than 149 plant species, including two globally threatened species such as the Indian Bdellium Tree and Desert Teak. By strengthening livestock grazing resources and promoting sustainable vegetation use, the project is expected to deliver long-term ecological resilience in Tharparkar.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Qasim Siraj Soomro, Member of the Provincial Assembly from Tharparkar appreciated the initiative, stating: “The people of Thar deeply value these efforts which help protect the threatened wildlife, including the rich flora. Conserving our fast-declining plant species is not only vital for biodiversity but also for the livelihoods of our communities who depend on livestock and rangelands. This conservation station gives us hope that future generations will inherit a greener and more sustainable Thar”.\nMahmood Akhtar Cheema, Country Representative, IUCN Pakistan, explained that Thar is home to some of the most unique and threatened plant species in the world, including those listed on the IUCN Red List. This initiative contributes not only to local ecological resilience but also helps achieve global biodiversity targets. “It is high time we must support conservation initiatives and reconnect local communities to the threatened biodiversity”, he added.\nAmir Iqbal, Chief Executive Officer SECMC, stated: “With its critical role in enhancing Pakistan’s energy security and rich ecological heritage, Thar stands as a beacon of hope, resilience, and national progress. As a socially responsible company, SECMC remains committed to uplifting local communities while leading sustainable development in the region. The launch of Pakistan’s first-ever Flora Conservation Station, in partnership with our valued partner IUCN, is another milestone in our journey to safeguard Thar’s unique biodiversity.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
