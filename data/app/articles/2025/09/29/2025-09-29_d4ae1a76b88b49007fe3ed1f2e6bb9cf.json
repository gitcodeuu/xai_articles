This forced reporters to boycott the day’s proceedings.\nHe also criticized an online campaign against the senior journalist in which threatening remarks were made. He said such actions could put lives at risk.\n“This House must set an example of tolerance. Politics and civility go together, and disagreements should be resolved through dialogue, not abuse,” he said.\nThe minister warned that intimidation instead of debate could weaken democracy. He urged the government and allied parties to act immediately to address the journalist’s concerns.\nHe also asked lawmakers from all parties to help resolve the issue, stressing that press freedom and respect for journalists were vital for democracy.\nPPP leader Shazia Marri also condemned the mistreatment of Aijaz Ahmed and the online harassment campaign against him.
