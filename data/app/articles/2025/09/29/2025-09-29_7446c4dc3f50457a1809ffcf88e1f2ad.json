He stressed that Pakistan’s civil servants had always demonstrated competence, commitment, and performance in carrying out their responsibilities.\nGilani underlined that the civil service was the custodian of the state system and its prestige. He appreciated the Inland Study Tour for providing officers with practical exposure to the workings of governmental and parliamentary institutions.\nHe noted that the Senate Secretariat was actively promoting transparency and efficiency through e-governance and artificial intelligence. Praising the contribution of officers during the recent floods in South Punjab, he said that natural disasters tested both institutional capacity and the spirit of public service.\nHighlighting climate change as a pressing challenge, the Acting President said it was a shared responsibility of all institutions and communities. “At the senior management level, leadership must adopt cooperation, learning, innovation, and humility,” he remarked.\nHe emphasized that achieving national development goals was not possible for any single department or institution alone and called for collective efforts to ensure progress.
