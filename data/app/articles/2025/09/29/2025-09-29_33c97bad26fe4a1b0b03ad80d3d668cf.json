He underlined that the policy, initiated under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif during the PDM government, had now been further strengthened to ensure continuity and greater impact.\nHighlighting the scope of the policy, he said it was designed for all segments of youth, whether enrolled in schools, colleges and universities, or those who are currently out of the education system. “Every young Pakistani must be given the chance to shape a dignified life,” he said, adding that women would be an integral part of employment programmes up to 2029.\nHe informed that a dedicated committee on technical education and IT, headed by the Prime Minister, meets every two months to review progress and expand initiatives to reduce unemployment. He said that along with providing overseas job opportunities, the policy would equip young people with essential language and professional skills.\nRana Mashhood announced that ten new businesses would be registered to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation. He added that youth involved in negative activities would also be rehabilitated and provided constructive opportunities under initiatives like green jobs. He said that employment exchanges were being established in every district to facilitate job seekers not only through online platforms but also through doorstep services.\nThe Chairman said that the National Youth Employment Policy is a landmark step to address unemployment, empower the young generation, and transform them into a driving force for Pakistan’s progress.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
