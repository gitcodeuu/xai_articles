Pakistan expects the Interim Afghan Government to uphold its responsibilities and deny its soil for Terrorists activities against Pakistan.\nSanitization operation is being conducted to eliminate any other Indian sponsored Kharji found in the area, as the security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of Indian Sponsored Terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave men further strengthen our resolve.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
