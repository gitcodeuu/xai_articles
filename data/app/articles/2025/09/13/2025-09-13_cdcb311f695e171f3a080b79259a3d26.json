  "content": "United Nations, Sep 13 (APP): United Nations Speakers at a high-level event arranged jointly by the Permanent Mission of Pakistan to the United Nations and the Muslim-American Leadership Alliance (MALA), have stated that the Indian move to unilaterally hold the Indus Waters Treaty (IWT) in abeyance has raised serious doubts about the sanctity of international commitments.\nThey termed the Indian action as a grave violation of international law, including international humanitarian law and human rights law.\nThe high-level event held at the UN headquarters on the theme of “Indus Waters Treaty and Pakistan’s Water Crisis: Challenges and the Way Forward” attracted participants from a wide array of fields including diplomats, academics, policy practitioners, students, water experts and members of different organizations.\nIn addition to Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, who was the keynote speaker, the event was addressed by Barrister Dawood Ghazanvi, Maha Khan, Dr. Kishor Uprety, Dr. Masood Ahmad, and Shahmeer Helapota. Deputy Permanent Representative of Pakistan Ambassador Usman Jadoon was also present on the occasion.\nIn his keynote speech, Ambassador Asim Iftikhar Ahmad warned against weaponization of water with serious consequences for regional peace and stability.\nHe said that treating water as an instrument of political leverage is to deny people their most fundamental human right. He described IWT as a rare triumph of cooperation in a region that has been often beset by divergences.\nHe stated with absolute clarity that the treaty remains legally intact, adding that the Permanent Court of Arbitration, in its recent decisions of June and August 2025, reaffirmed the continuing validity of the Treaty and its binding dispute-resolution mechanisms.\n“These rulings leave no ambiguity — no party has the authority to unilaterally suspend or abandon this agreement. The Indus Waters Treaty is alive, and its provisions remain binding on the parties,” he highlighted.\nTouching on two key dimensions, Ambassador Asim said that the consequences of undermining the Treaty are extremely grave in terms of human suffering.\nWater – especially in arid regions like ours – cannot be with held or manipulated by the upper riparian without serious consequences for the lower riparian. He said that it is a basic human right, the foundation of public health, food production, and human dignity.\n“Water scarcity heightens vulnerabilities, particularly for women and children. The human cost of undermining the Indus Waters Treaty is therefore borne disproportionately by those least able to endure it,” he explained.\nHe said that beyond the humanitarian dimension, Indian actions carry grave implications for peace and security. The Indus Waters Treaty has long functioned as a stabilizing force in South Asia, insulating a vital resource from political tensions and conflict. He said that its weakening risks creating a new fault line in a region already marked by volatility.\n“The UN Security Council has recognized the link between natural resource management and international peace and security. And nowhere is that link more evident than in the case of the Indus waters,” he stated.\nMaha Khan, Chairperson of the Muslim-American Leadership Alliance (MALA), stated on the occasion that MALA has long championed the values and goals of the United Nations, with a strong commitment to advancing the Sustainable Development Goals. She said that among these, water security has been at the heart of our work, given its profound humanitarian implications for Pakistan.\nShe said that the water crisis is not a distant challenge—it is a pressing threat to livelihoods, stability, and human dignity.\nAddressing it is not only urgent, but essential to ensuring peace and sustainable development, she argued.\nIn his remarks, Kishor Uprety, independent legal consultant, examined the Treaty through a legal lens, referring to it as a remarkable framework of cooperation but warning that its credibility is under strain.\nHe argued that terrorism allegations cannot be classified as material breaches that justify suspension and reminded the participants that the Treaty contains no exit clause – its termination can only come through a replacement agreement.\nHe criticized India for bypassing dispute resolution mechanisms set in place. He further cautioned that suspension or collapse of the Treaty would have far-reaching consequences across Asia and even beyond. He stressed the need for strict adherence to international legal norms to preserve the balance between regional powers and protect the human rights of the people.\nDr. Masood Ahmad, former eminent water expert at the World Bank, brought forth the technical depth and engineering basis of the Indus Waters Treaty, which, he said, enabled significant infrastructure development across the basin. He emphasized that beyond legal and political debates, the real challenge lies in improving water efficiency, irrigation systems, and resilience in times of crisis.\nBy advocating for more productive and adaptive water usage, Dr. Masood suggested that Pakistan must strengthen its capacity to respond to future shocks, ensuring that the treaty continues to function as a foundation for sustainable development.\nDawood Ghazanavi, lawyer of the Supreme Court of Pakistan, centered his talk on the humanitarian consequences of the treaty violations, noting how India’s failure to share hydrological data and key information with Pakistan contributed to devastating displacements and mass migrations caused by floods.\nHe argued that India’s dam constructions and unilateral actions violate international conventions. He described water deprivation as a breach of basic human rights. He called on the World Bank, as a facilitator and guarantor, to reassert its role in mediation, while also urging UN involvement and mobilization of civil society to demand compliance.\nGhazanavi stressed that 45% of Pakistan’s livelihoods primarily depend on the Indus, warning that water insecurity threatens both survival and stability.\nLegal scholar Shahmeer Halepota, who is a partner at Aza Law International Arbitration, presented the Treaty as South Asia’s most durable example of multilateralism and cooperation but pointed to serious flaws in its current dispute resolution system. He said that while the World Bank once played an active moderating role, its recent silence has led to delays and inconsistent rulings.\nHalepota advocated for the modernization of the mechanisms by consolidating jurisdiction under a single Permanent Court of Arbitration with a flexible pool of experts to deliver timely solutions. He said that strengthening enforcement and compliance processes is crucial to prevent further escalation, uphold international law and international humanitarian law, and preserve the treaty’s credibility in the face of mounting challenges.\nIn his concluding remarks, Ambassador Usman Jadoon, Deputy Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the UN, thanked the panelists for their insightful remarks. He said that the deliberations highlighted that the Indus Waters Treaty, despite current challenges, remains a binding and enduring international instrument.\nHe said that the Indus River system is not only Pakistan’s lifeline but also a shared heritage of humanity.\nHe said, “We are reminded today that the humanitarian implications of undermining the treaty are grave,” adding that denial of critical data sharing translates into food insecurity, displacement, and heightened vulnerabilities — especially for women, children, and the poor.\nHe said that upholding and revitalizing the treaty requires collective action. The United Nations system, the World Bank, and civil society all have roles to play in reinforcing its implementation, facilitating dialogue, and promoting cooperative solutions.",
