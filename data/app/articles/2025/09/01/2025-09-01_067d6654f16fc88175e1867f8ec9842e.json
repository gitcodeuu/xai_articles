For instance, Ghana demanded $8 billion to shift away from coal-based power, while Nigeria and Indonesia were also benefiting from climate funds.\nFederal Minister Awais Leghari informed the UN representative that Pakistan was already moving toward renewable energy, even without external assistance, and highlighted that the government’s Green Financing Division under the PPMC and an inter-ministerial committee were actively working to mobilize resources.\nThe minister emphasized that post-flood infrastructure rehabilitation would not be carried out on traditional lines but with a forward-looking approach that addressed future climate challenges. Mohamed Yahya agreed, adding that a comprehensive post-disaster assessment was vital to ensure resilient and sustainable rebuilding in collaboration with the Government of Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
