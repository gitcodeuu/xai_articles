Under the leadership of Federal Secretary Nadeem Mahbub and Director General Asif Iqbal Asif, he said, the DGSE was undergoing a transformation in service delivery for children with disabilities.\nCalling PSL standardization the flagship reform, Dr Siddiqui announced the formation of a National PSL Task Force to implement recommendations with clear timelines, interpreter training, and digital resources.\nHe reaffirmed the government’s resolve to integrate PSL into curricula, media and public services.\n“This consultation is more than a policy dialogue—it is a collective pledge to build a Pakistan where every child, every citizen, hearing or Deaf, has a language, a voice, and a future full of possibility,” he said.\nThe Minister expressed gratitude to UNICEF, provincial governments, the Deaf community, and DGSE officials for their commitment, vowing that PSL would become a bridge to equality and dignity for all citizens.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
