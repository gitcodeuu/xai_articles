This blend of research and teaching makes our graduates uniquely skilled,” he said.\nEncouraging young people to consider a career in forestry, he said, “If you are a true nature lover and have enthusiasm, then the sky is the limit. This is a field where you can contribute directly to the planet’s survival.”\n“Cities and countries with strong forestry education and policies are always more climate-resilient and economically competitive. For Pakistan, investing in forest education today means a healthier environment, stronger disaster resilience, and new opportunities in the global carbon market tomorrow,” Dr. Anwar remarked.\nHe emphasized that Pakistan’s forests are not just natural resources but critical shields against disasters. “Forests are essential for our survival and resilience in the face of prolonged droughts, catastrophic floods, rising temperatures, heatwaves, and other extreme weather events,” he cautioned.\nHe said that Pakistan’s vast rangelands, barren lands, and agroforestry resources could support green projects on a massive scale. “Around 60 percent of the country is rangeland, which makes us unique. With agroforestry systems already in place, the scope for reforestation and afforestation projects is enormous,” he noted.\nHighlighting the transformation of forestry as a discipline, Dr. Anwar said it had evolved far beyond timber harvesting.\n“Our ecosystems play a vital role in biodiversity conservation, watershed and soil protection, and climate change mitigation. Increasingly, private actors are entering the sector to develop projects for carbon and biodiversity credits,” he explained.\nDr. Anwar described carbon credits as a key financial tool for Pakistan to tap into the global carbon market. “There are three main ways to generate carbon credits: carbon removal or sequestration, emission avoidance, and emission reduction. When you remove one tonne of CO2 from the atmosphere, that is counted as one carbon credit,” he said.\nHe said that with proper management of forests and range lands, Pakistan can earn significant revenues through carbon credits while also contributing to global climate goals. “Forestry is no longer just about planting trees; it’s about integrating Pakistan into the international green economy,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
