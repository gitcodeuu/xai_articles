However, some civilians and FC personnel also lost their lives in the incident, he said.\nTalal said that the exact figures of those martyred and wounded were being verified and would be provided shortly.\nHe said footage and other technical material linking the attack to “Indian proxies” had circulated on social media platforms and investigations into such links were underway.\nThe minister paid tribute to the brave personnel of the security forces who sacrificed their lives to stop the intruders.\nHe also urged the politicians to stand united behind the security agencies.\nRegarding enforced disappearances, Talal Chaudhry said the government has zero tolerance in this regard. A new commission, headed by a Supreme Court judge, had been constituted to examine missing-persons cases and promised to place a detailed report before the House in due course, he said.\nHe said that official numbers of missing persons in the country were relatively low and that the government would present case-by-case details.\nHe said the political leadership must create a national strategy and consensus to support security forces across provinces and at the federal level.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
