However, neither of them was present in the courtroom at the time. A junior lawyer appeared on their behalf. When asked about their absence, the counsel informed the judge that the accused had earlier marked their attendance but left for another hearing scheduled in Rawalpindi.\nDuring the hearing, the prosecution submitted a seven-page charge sheet. The document included a list of four witnesses, namely Sub-Inspector Shehroz Riaz, Waseem Khan, Technical Assistant Anees-ur-Rehman, and Assistant Director Imran Haider. The prosecution maintained in the report that the controversial tweets were posted by Imaan Mazari and later retweeted by Hadi Ali Chatha.\nThe court summoned the prosecution witnesses for upcoming hearings and heard arguments on different aspects of the case. Judge Majoka expressed displeasure over the repeated absence of the accused and remarked that deliberate attempts to disrupt court proceedings would not be tolerated.\nFollowing this, the court issued non-bailable arrest warrants against Mazari and Chatha and ordered their production before the bench. The hearing was adjourned till Wednesday.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
