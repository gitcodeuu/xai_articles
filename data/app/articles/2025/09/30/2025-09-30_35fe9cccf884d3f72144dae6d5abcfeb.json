As a result of the blast, four children were martyred and five others were injured.\nThis is the same area where, a few weeks ago, a video of Khawarij playing cricket with local children went viral. Under such deceitful tactics, they lure innocent children and leave dangerous explosives near them.\nThe security sources said this has always been the method of the Khawarij by killing unarmed and innocent civilians in the name of jihad, and deliberately placing explosives near civilian populations. The greatest victims of these heinous acts are often young children.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
