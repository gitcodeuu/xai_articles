Legislative work is now underway for the sixth time.\nDespite repeated correspondence and meetings with the Punjab Government, the necessary legislation and conduct of local government elections have yet to be finalized.\nThe Secretary also informed the Commission that, in an effort to expedite the process, a hearing was held on June 2, 2025.\nDuring this hearing, the Provincial Minister for Local Government, Punjab and the Secretary Local Government, Punjab, appeared before the Commission and stated that the draft local government law was under review by the Standing Committee.\nThey added that the provincial government was engaged in the budget session and requested an additional three months to complete the legislation.\nThe Election Commission, in its order, granted the requested extension; however, no progress has been reported to date.\nThe meeting was attended by the members of the Commission, the Secretary ECP, and other senior officials.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
