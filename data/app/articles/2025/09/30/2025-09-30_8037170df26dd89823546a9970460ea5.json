Iqbal Choudhary highlighted the urgent need for innovation in health research across the Muslim world.\nHe said, “Healthcare providers and researchers in many OIC member states face limited infrastructure, funding shortages, and a lack of trained personnel. These same constraints make innovation, ingenuity, and capacity building more essential than ever.”\nProf. Dr. Abdul Basit, Chairman HealthRAB, echoed this view, stressing that institutional strength in clinical research was vital for improving healthcare outcomes.\n“Even in constrained environments, we can build centres of excellence through collaboration, commitment, and innovation,” he remarked.\nProf. Dr. Zakiuddin Ahmed, General Secretary HealthRAB, introduced the mission of HealthRAB and announced continued partnership with COMSTECH to host future workshops and conferences for building leadership and research capacity in the healthcare sector.\nThe programme featured interactive group activities, discussions on establishing research centres in resource-limited settings, and a panel session on developing a health research ecosystem through collaboration.\nDr. Samina Naeem Khalid, Professor and Researcher at the Health Services Academy Islamabad, was among the key panelists.\nConcluding with a vote of thanks, participants-both in person and online-appreciated the initiative for offering practical insights and laying the foundation for stronger clinical research frameworks in challenging environments.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
