That spirit of sacrifice and excellence remains alive in every generation of the PAF,” he added.\nThe president expressed that he took immense pride in how the Air Force had evolved into a modern, capable, and highly professional institution.\nWhether it was the 1965 war or the more recent Marka-e-Haq Bunyanum-Marsus, their air warriors had always risen to the challenge, giving the enemy a decisive response and filling the nation with pride, he added.\nHe further said that the world witnessed the remarkable skill and professionalism of PAF, and he firmly believed its modern capabilities were one of the strongest guarantees of Pakistan’s security.\n‘On this occasion, I salute the families of our martyrs, who bear the greatest sacrifice of all. Their loved ones live on as eternal heroes in the nation’s heart. I also salute the ghazis whose resilience and dedication remain a living example of courage,” the president added.\nExpressing his confidence, he said the Pakistan Air Force would continue to protect their skies and sovereignty with the same resolve and passion that had always defined it.",
