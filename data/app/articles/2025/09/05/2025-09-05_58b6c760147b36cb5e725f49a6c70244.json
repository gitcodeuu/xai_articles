He paid tribute to Pakistani scholars, researchers, and Naat reciters who were recognized during the ceremony for their outstanding contributions to Islamic literature and Seerat studies.\n“Celebrating the birth of the Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) is not only an expression of devotion but also a renewal of faith. The Seerat Conference will help to spread his universal message of peace, mercy, and humanity,” he added.\nThe minister stressed that the Prophet’s exemplary morals, tolerance, forgiveness, and compassion should serve as a model for individual and collective life. “Our duty as Muslims is to embody the Prophet’s teachings by promoting brotherhood, respect, sacrifice, justice, and kindness in society,” he said.\nThe event also featured recitations of classical and contemporary Naats, with references to the legacy of early Islamic poets such as Hazrat Hassan bin Thabit (RA), who was honored by the Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) himself for his poetic defense of Islam.\nThe minister concluded with prayers for the progress and stability of Pakistan, urging citizens to carry forward the Prophet’s mission of peace and unity.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
