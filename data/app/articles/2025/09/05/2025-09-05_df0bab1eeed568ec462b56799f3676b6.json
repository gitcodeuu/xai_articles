President Asif Ali Zardari strengthened the roots of democracy by empowering the Parliament; while Bilawal Bhutto Zardari symbolizes hope for the younger generation, determined to steer Pakistan towards development, prosperity, and lasting peace.\nReflecting on present challenges, the Chairman stressed that Defence Day calls upon the nation to introspect and transform political, economic, and social weaknesses into strengths. “Our foremost responsibility is to gift our future generations a Pakistan that is strong, prosperous, peaceful, and progressive,” he said.\nHighlighting the eternal message of sacrifice, he remarked that the martyrs’ legacy reminds us that safeguarding the homeland is paramount. “We must strengthen national unity and renew our pledge that every citizen will play their full role in the construction and progress of Pakistan,” he stated.\nConcluding his message, Chairman Gilani said Pakistan is a sacred trust, and it is the duty of every citizen to protect it at all costs. He reiterated that Pakistan’s armed forces rank among the finest in the world, and the nation stands shoulder to shoulder with them in every testing time. “On this day, we must resolve with sincerity that we will fulfil our individual and collective responsibilities with honesty to transform Pakistan into a cradle of peace, prosperity, and progress,” he reaffirmed.",
