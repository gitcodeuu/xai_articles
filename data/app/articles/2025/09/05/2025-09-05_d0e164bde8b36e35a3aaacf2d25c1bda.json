He also denounced the recent attack on Iran, a fellow SCO member state.\nHe stated that the PM stressed the importance of meaningful engagement with Afghanistan, noting that instability in Afghanistan undermines development across the entire SCO region. The PM also highlighted the significance of regional connectivity and economic integration, pointing to Pakistan’s strategic geographical location as a potential trade and transit hub for the SCO.\nHe underscored the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a cornerstone for regional integration under President Xi Jinping’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).\nShafqat Ali Khan said on the sidelines of the summit, the prime minister held a series of bilateral meetings with the Presidents of China, Russia, Türkiye, Iran, Azerbaijan, and Tajikistan. These discussions focused on enhancing political, economic, trade, energy, and defense cooperation. Notably, the PM congratulated Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev on the signing of the historic peace agreement with Armenia, marking a significant step toward peace in the South Caucasus.\nIn his meeting with President Xi Jinping, the PM reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering support for China’s territorial integrity and praised its achievements in economic development. Discussions with Chinese Premier Li Qiang focused on deepening cooperation in emerging sectors and supporting President Xi’s multilateral initiatives, including the Global Development, Security, and Civilization Initiatives.\nHe said the prime minister also addressed the Pakistan-China Business-to-Business Investment Conference, attended by over 800 companies, where he identified agriculture, mining, IT, textiles, and industrial development as key areas for future collaboration.\nShafqat Ali Khan noted that Prime Minister Sharif also participated in China’s 80th Victory Day Anniversary Parade, celebrating its World War II victory alongside other global leaders.\nTurning to other diplomatic developments, the Foreign Office Spokesperson confirmed that Pakistan and Armenia formally established diplomatic relations during a meeting between Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Senator Mohammad Ishaq Dar and Armenian Foreign Minister Ararat Mirzoyan.

However, it is not as detailed as it was in the past,” the spokesperson stated. He further noted that India has not used the established channel of the Indus Water Commissioners, as outlined in the Treaty. “The established channel of Indus Water Commissioner has not been used. In that context, we reiterate that India should fully comply with all the provisions of the Indus Water Treaty,” he added.\nHowever, he acknowledged that the situation on the ground, including losses running into billions, raises serious questions about India’s conduct.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
