This collaboration with Alkhidmat Foundation reflects our commitment to social responsibility by ensuring healthcare workers have the protection they need to continue serving on the frontlines. Through initiatives like this, we strive to make a lasting difference where it matters most.”\nThis donation builds on Zong’s ongoing partnership with Alkhidmat Foundation, which has previously delivered healthcare services to over 3,000 patients in Sindh through Mobile Health Units and is currently extending relief to flood-affected communities.
