The time for an immediate, unconditional ceasefire is now, alongside an unhindered flow of humanitarian assistance.”\nHe said that Pakistan believed every state, big or small, deserved equal dignity and respect.\nReferring to the Pakistan-India conflict between May 7 to 10, he said the Indian claims of being a regional hegemon or net security provider were buried as Pakistan acted in self-defence after it was forced into war.\nHe told the interviewer that as a nuclear-armed state, Pakistan did not want destabilization in the region, as it would have far-reaching consequences.\nThe deputy prime minister said that Israel had done nothing to implement UN resolutions on Palestine, while India unilaterally revoked special status of Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nHe viewed that mechanisms like severe economic sanctions could be applied to countries that ignore UNSC resolutions, creating significant pain.\nThe deputy prime minister appreciated the positive role the US played during the India-Pakistan war, and reiterated that Pakistan never asked for a ceasefire.\nRegarding the Indian decision to suspend Indus Waters Treaty, he said India’s wish to manipulate water was unacceptable, as Pakistan’s National Security Committee also declared that any such action would be treated as an act of war, “and we mean it.”\nAsked whether there was any back channel open with India, Ishaq Dar said that Pakistan did not mind bilateral talks, but dialogues must be comprehensive, covering terrorism, trade, economy, and Jammu and Kashmir.\n“We’re not begging for dialogue. As a peace-loving country, we welcome it, but it takes two to tango. India must be willing.”\nComing to terrorism, he said that Pakistan had credible evidence that other countries’ agencies were involved in financing and funding terrorism. This evidence has been shared with international agencies and was on record.\nHe said that the incumbent government and the security forces were fully focused on cleansing Pakistan of terrorism. When it comes to the lives of Pakistani soldiers or civilians, that’s our red line, and we’ll take any action to stop it, he resolved.\nTo a question, he said that the bilateral relations with Afghanistan had improved significantly and reiterated Pakistan’s call for action against terrorist elements like TTP, BLA, and Majeed Brigade.",
