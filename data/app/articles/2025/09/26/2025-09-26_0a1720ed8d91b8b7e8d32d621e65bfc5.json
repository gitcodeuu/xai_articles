The PBF is actively advocating for structured initiatives that empower the diaspora to participate more meaningfully in bilateral economic and cultural development, especially in entrepreneurship, technology transfer and youth mentorship.\nLooking ahead, the PBF has called on both governments to institutionalize a formal U.S.–Pakistan Economic Policy Dialogue that actively included private sector leaders and policy experts.\nThe Forum also proposed the creation of a joint innovation and investment fund to support collaborative ventures in clean technology and digital infrastructure.\nFurthermore, the PBF urged renewed focus on inclusive development by ensuring the active participation of women in leadership roles across trade, diplomacy and economic policy.\nPBF SVP further stated, “This is a defining moment for U.S–Pakistan relations. We must now shift the focus from reactive diplomacy to proactive, people-centered partnerships. It is time to build a relationship that reflects the hopes and potential of our citizens and the realities of a fast-evolving global economy.”",
