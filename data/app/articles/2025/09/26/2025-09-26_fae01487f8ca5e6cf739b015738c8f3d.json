However, he said that unlike the first visit when the president met with the top Chinese leadership, he focused on mid-level Chinese leadership, engaging extensively with provincial governors and Communist Party officials to promote investment and cooperation.\nPresident Zardari witnessed the signing of six key agreements with various Chinese institutions in areas including transportation, waste management, energy, education, and agriculture.\nPresident’s spokesperson Murtaza Solangi highlighted that while President Zardari’s first visit included meetings with China’s top leadership, including President Xi Jinping, this visit deliberately focused on provincial-level engagement. “The President visited Shanghai, Urumqi, Kashgar, and Sichuan, covering a broad spectrum of sectors such as agriculture, public health, biotechnology, food security, transportation, and education,” he said.\nOne of the most notable aspects of the visit, Solangi noted, was the unprecedented presence of Chinese Ambassador to Pakistan Jiang Zaidong, who accompanied President Zardari throughout the tour on instructions from Beijing which reflected the level of bilateral relationships.\nSaleem Mandviwala underlining the historic nature of President Zardari’s visit to Kashgar, making him the first Pakistani head of state to do so said that the visit came at the invitation of the Chinese government.\nHe also termed the president’s tour of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC) a milestone, noting that Zardari became the first foreign head of state to be invited to the AVIC complex. The president was briefed on China’s latest aerospace capabilities including the J-10 fighter jet, JF-17 Thunder co-production, J-20 stealth aircraft, UAV technologies, and multi-domain command-and-control systems.\n“This visit could pave the way for future agreements for the procurement of advanced defence technologies from China,” Mandviwala added.\nAmong the key outcomes of the visit was the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for the establishment of a Coal Gasification and Fertilizer Plant in Thar, Sindh, the first of its kind to utilize Thar coal. This project is expected to address energy needs while supporting Pakistan’s agriculture sector.\nThe president also witnessed the signing of three additional MoUs focused on modernizing Pakistan’s livestock industry, construction of a modern textile industrial park, and supply and after-sales services for fire trucks and emergency equipment, Mandviwalla said adding that another agreement was signed for waste and tyre recycling in Karachi, while President Zardari also experienced China’s high-speed rail network, expressing his desire to see similar technology adopted in Pakistan.\nAs regards the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Mandviwalla confirmed that discussions were held to reinvigorate and expand the initiative.\nTo a question, Mandviwalla clarified that the agreements and projects signed during the visit were not limited to Sindh, but were meant to benefit the entire country.\nIn response to another query, Senator Mandviwalla said that the Chinese leadership expressed satisfaction over Pakistan’s recent operational success in “Operation Bunyan um-Marsoos,” against India particularly noting the effective use of Chinese-made aircraft.\nBoth Solangi and Mandviwalla emphasized that President Zardari was continuing the strong foundation of bilateral cooperation laid during his previous tenure (2008–2013), and the recent visit further cements Pakistan-China ties as comprehensive and strategic partners.",
