Integration of the New Gwadar International Airport with the port was also prioritized to enhance multi-transit connectivity.\nThe framework encourages adoption of electronic data interchange and smart port technologies to connect Gwadar with Chinese and global shipping networks. It also includes development of port-related industries, warehousing, and cold storage facilities to facilitate regional trade and transshipment.\nBeyond infrastructure, the plan promotes science, industry, and tourism cooperation, including joint marine science research centers, CPEC Industrial Parks for fisheries, shipbuilding, and aquaculture, plus maritime tourism ventures like cruises and water sports along Balochistan’s coast.\nEducation and sustainability are cross-cutting priorities, with academic partnerships and training exchanges between Pakistani and Chinese institutions to develop skilled manpower in logistics, port operations, and fisheries. The plan aligns with Belt and Road’s ‘green energy & ocean’ goals to balance growth with environmental protection.\nJunaid Chaudhry emphasized that the 2025–2029 Action Plan demonstrates Pakistan’s resolve to build a resilient maritime economy and consolidate strategic ties with China, strengthening Pakistan’s maritime presence and advancing shared prosperity under the CPEC framework.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
