  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 24 (APP):Jazz has been ranked as Pakistan’s fastest mobile network in the latest Speedtest Intelligence report published by Ookla, covering January to June 2025.\nAccording to a news release, the report places Jazz ahead of its competitors in several key performance indicators, underscoring its lead in mobile connectivity at a time when digital access is increasingly central to everyday life.\nAccording to Ookla, Jazz recorded a median download speed of 24.23 Mbps and upload speed of 9.13 Mbps, outperforming Zong, which followed with 20.43 Mbps. Latency, a measure critical for online gaming and video calls, was also lowest on Jazz at 44 milliseconds.\nBeyond raw speeds, Jazz posted the highest Speedtest Connectivity Score of 56.52, which reflects not just network performance but also the quality of browsing and streaming. In video streaming, the operator led the market with a score of 65.54, while in gaming performance Zong slightly edged Jazz with a Game Score of 66.74 compared to 66.07.\nThe findings also shed light on regional performance. Faisalabad emerged as the fastest city with a median download speed of 24.45 Mbps, followed by Lahore and Multan. Punjab posted the highest regional speeds overall, while Quetta and Azad Jammu and Kashmir trailed behind.\nWhile Jazz dominated most categories, Ookla noted that consistency scores were largely similar across providers, with the exception of Telenor, which lagged. Importantly, customer feedback collected by Speedtest users also placed Jazz on top, with an overall satisfaction rating of 3.67 out of 5, well ahead of its peers.\nIndustry observers note that such results carry weight in a country where mobile internet has become the backbone of commerce, education, entertainment, and healthcare. With over 147 million mobile broadband users, improvements in speed and reliability are seen as critical for Pakistan’s broader digital transformation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
