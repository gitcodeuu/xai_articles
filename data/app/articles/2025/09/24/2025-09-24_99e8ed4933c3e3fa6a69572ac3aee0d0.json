He observed that Russia’s aggression over Ukraine and occupation of Crimea have created a security misbalance, and underscored the need for checking this tendency.\nTo a question on President Trump’s desire to takeover Greenland as part of ‘strategic depth’, the ambassador said that it is a point of concern for Norway, and Oslo’s positioning will be with the Danish government.\nAmbassador Albert dispelled the tendency in international relations based on double-standards, and supported the two-state solution on Palestine. He condemned Israel’s Gaza massacre and genocide, and called for addressing the issue on an urgent basis.\nHe also stressed the need for proactivity in regional organisations, and for working closely with Pakistan for the collective good of both the countries.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
