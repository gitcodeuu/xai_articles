  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 24 (APP): CMPak, a leading telecom operator in Pakistan, has partnered with Huawei to introduce a Simplified Private Network Solution aimed at accelerating the digital transformation of key industries, including mining, logistics, and manufacturing.\nTo achieve this, CMPak and Huawei jointly launch a unified enterprise node (Card-UEN), a simplified, integrated private network solution, for the enterprise market.\nThe solution is designed to tackle the pain points encountered by local enterprises throughout digital transformation.\nFeaturing space saving, cost-effectiveness, easy deployment, and fast deployment, the solution introduces informatization momentum to conventional industries such as mining, logistics, and manufacturing, helping Pakistan achieve its strategic goal of “Digital Pakistan 2030.”\nIn recent years, Pakistan’s economy has been growing rapidly, but the digital penetration among enterprises remains low.\nProblems such as scattered infrastructure investment, poor technology adaptability, and high initial expenditure have long hindered the upgrade of various industries.\nAgainst this backdrop, CMPak and Huawei have jointly developed a simplified integrated private network solution. This solution is precisely tailored to local requirements through four innovative designs, including the Card-UEN is co-located with the BBU of the (R)AN in one subrack, reducing equipment room footprint by 60% and power consumption by 30%.\nIt is well-suited, as most small and medium-sized enterprises in Pakistan are facing equipment room space limitations.\nSimplified site deployment using a single cable: The Card-UEN is directly connected to a wireless switch through a single network cable over the N2, N3, Om, or N6 interface. Under this context, joint site deployment can be performed for the Card-UEN and base station, improving efficiency by 80% compared with conventional approaches.\nThe Card-UEN supports full convergence of 4G and 5G as well as the 3GPP unicast trunking technology, meeting trunking communication requirements in remote areas, such as mining and forestry areas.\nThe local Web LMT provides visualized monitoring capabilities, reducing the technical skill requirements for enterprise IT teams.\nDespite their ongoing reliance on basic network services, most traditional enterprises in Pakistan can achieve digital and intelligent transformation through the lightweight adaptation capability of the solution—without the need for substantial infrastructure investment.\nAs a key node in the Digital Corridor of the Belt and Road Initiative, Pakistan plays a pivotal role. It collaborates with the Huawei local engineering team to continue enhancing their enterprise private network solutions, assisting CMPak in building a digital foundation that spans all industries.\nWith the future implementation of Card-UEN, the collaboration between CMPak and Huawei will not only transform the production methods of Pakistani enterprises but also set a benchmark for the digitalization process across South Asia, bringing to life the vision of “empowering industries through technological innovation.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
