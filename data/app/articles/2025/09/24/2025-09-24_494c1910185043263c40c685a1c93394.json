With these immense benefits comes the paramount responsibility to protect, preserve and harness the oceans, both for our present as well as future generations.\n“The sea holds exceptional strategic, economic and developmental significance for Pakistan. Our coastline and Exclusive Economic Zone present unparalleled opportunities for economic growth through fisheries, shipping, energy and in fact, the all-encompassing Blue Economy. This places a solemn obligation upon us to safeguard the marine environment and ensure safe and healthy maritime practices,” he added.\nHe said that Pakistan Navy (PN) remains firmly committed to these goals, safeguarding maritime security and promoting regional stability through its constant vigilance in the North Arabian Sea. PN also participates in international coalitions, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations. In addition, PN protects vital sea lanes and upholds the sanctity of freedom of navigation.\nConcurrently, PN collaborates with national stakeholders to foster maritime awareness, drive sustainable development of the maritime sector and acts as a lynchpin in realising Pakistan’s vision of a thriving maritime nation.\nThe Navy’s obligations towards safety and security at sea, cooperation with partner nations and economic progress underscore its indispensable roles in shaping a prosperous maritime future for Pakistan and maintaining maritime order in the region.\nOn this occasion, “I reaffirm PN’s unwavering commitment to the IMO vision of safe, secure and environmentally friendly use of oceans. Guided by our national maritime objectives, we shall continue to play a constructive role in ensuring peace, security and stability at sea. May this day inspire us all to honour our obligations and seize the opportunities that the oceans offer for a more dependable, sustainable and prosperous future.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
