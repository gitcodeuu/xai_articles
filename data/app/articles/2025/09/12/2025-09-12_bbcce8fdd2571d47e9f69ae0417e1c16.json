Without unity in diversity, we cannot progress.”\nThe Advisor also expressed keen interest in COMSTECH’s support for the establishment of a Halal Institute in Uganda and highlighted ongoing efforts by Bangladesh’s Islamic Foundation on Halal certification.\nHe proposed collaboration with Pakistan’s Halal Authority and sought COMSTECH’s technical expertise for capacity building in this area.\nThe Ambassador of Bangladesh to Pakistan, Md Iqbal Hussain Khan, extended appreciation to the Coordinator General and COMSTECH officials for their warm hospitality and reaffirmed Bangladesh’s commitment to working closely with COMSTECH for achieving mutual benefits and strengthening cooperation among OIC member states.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
