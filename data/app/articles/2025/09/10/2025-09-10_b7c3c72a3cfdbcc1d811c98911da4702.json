He said President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm commitment to regional cooperation and integration.\n“Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif praised the SCO as the platform that best reflects Pakistan’s firm commitment to regional cooperation and integration and said that Pakistan will always stand side by side with China in the pursuit of peace, progress and prosperity,” Jiang said.\nSpeaking about the Global Governance Initiative, Jiang said it is another important public good proposed by China following the Global Development Initiative, the Global Security Initiative, and the Global Civilization Initiative.\nHe said it injects strong momentum into building a more just and reasonable global governance system and demonstrates the broad vision and responsibility of President Xi Jinping.\nThe ambassador explained that the initiative is based on five principles: sovereign equality as the prerequisite, international rule of law as the guarantee, multilateralism as the path, a people-centered approach as the orientation, and an action-oriented approach as the principle.\nHe added that Pakistan has expressed full support for the initiative. “Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif immediately stated that the Global Governance Initiative is of great significance to world peace, development, and stability, and is a historic step toward stronger multilateralism. Pakistan fully supports it and will actively implement it,” Jiang said.\nThe envoy also referred to the 80th anniversary of the victory in the Chinese People’s War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression and the World Anti-Fascist War.\nHe said the commemoration was meant to remember history, honor heroes, cherish peace, and create a better future.\nAmbassador Jiang said that history must not be forgotten, as more than 35 million Chinese people sacrificed their lives during the war, making a major contribution to safeguarding human civilization and world peace.\nHe stressed that remembering history is not to perpetuate hatred but to uphold peace. “The law of the jungle and the winner-takes-all approach are not the way for humanity. Hegemony cannot bring peace,” he said.\nHe said that just as countries once united against fascism 80 years ago, today nations must come together to resist hegemonic practices and work for a brighter future for humanity.\nThe ambassador underlined that China’s modernization is rooted in peaceful development, and the country will remain a force for peace, stability, and progress.\n“Both China and Pakistan suffered from the aggression, and both look forward to world peace and the happiness of the people. We stand ready to work with Pakistan to uphold international fairness and justice and promote the cause of peace and progress for humanity,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
