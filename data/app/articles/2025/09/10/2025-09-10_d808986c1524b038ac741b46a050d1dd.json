In my own district of Narowal, large tracts of land are underwater, resulting in the loss of crops, livestock, and vital infrastructure,” he said.\nAhsan Iqbal lauded the United Nations’ past assistance during natural disasters in Pakistan, calling its role “highly commendable.”\nHe said the government was currently conducting a thorough damage assessment and would work closely with the UN to evaluate losses and determine needs. “We will initiate the reconstruction phase using our own resources,” he added.\nThe minister said it was the moral responsibility of developed countries to provide funding to affected nations to address climate-related disasters.\n“Pakistan is home to more than 7,000 glaciers,” he said, adding that in Gilgit-Baltistan, glaciers were melting at a dangerously rapid pace, posing serious risks to downstream communities.\nHe said the current year has been declared the “Year of Glaciers,” and called for enhanced global cooperation in climate adaptation, disaster preparedness, and mitigation strategies to protect lives and ecosystems in the most affected regions.",
