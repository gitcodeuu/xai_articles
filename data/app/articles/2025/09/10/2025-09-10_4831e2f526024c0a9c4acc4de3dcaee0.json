Similarly, motorways and road networks from the northern regions to Karachi and Gwadar reduced costs, improved logistics, and boosted export-oriented industries.\nReferring to the Prime Minister’s recent visit, Aun Ali Syed said that President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif agreed to accelerate the second phase of CPEC.\nHe added that a major business conference was also held in Beijing, where dozens of Pakistani and Chinese companies participated, leading to multiple new investment agreements and MoUs that would generate employment and enhance exports.\nRegistrar of the University of Haripur, Riaz Muhammad, and Professor Dr. Muhaimin stressed that seminars and workshops play a vital role in raising awareness among the public, particularly students, about Pakistan’s most significant development initiative.\nThey noted that CPEC would not only lead to technological transformation but also create opportunities for thousands of Pakistani students to study advanced sciences in China.\nThey further highlighted that $25 billion has already been invested under CPEC, while an additional $40 billion is expected in the coming years, boosting Pakistan’s economic development.\nAdministrator of China Window, Naz Parveen, underlined the role of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) and said China is extending valuable support in Pakistan’s agriculture sector.\nShe emphasized the need to benefit from China’s agricultural advancements. She praised Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s successful visit and lauded President Xi Jinping’s announcement of continued Chinese support for Pakistan.\nIt is worth mentioning that China Window is actively organizing CPEC awareness seminars in universities across the province to engage youth and foster deeper understanding of this transformative project.",
