Gen. Inam Haider Malik informed participants that a national survey and audit will also be carried out to verify costs and needs.\nThe meeting stressed that this combined effort will help streamline reporting and enable a well-informed set of recommendations to be presented to the Prime Minister.\nThe committee will reconvene in the coming days to finalize its report for necessary action and resource allocation.\nRecent floods in AJK have severely damaged homes, roads, and infrastructure, with authorities under pressure to accelerate recovery efforts.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
