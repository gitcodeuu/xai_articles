By addressing malnutrition, particularly adolescent nutrition, and creating an environment that supports healthier choices, we can ensure mothers are healthier, children thrive, and our nation moves towards a stronger, more resilient future. The Ministry of Health is committed to leaving no stone unturned in this effort.”\nAdolescence, he noted, is a critical stage of the human life cycle, both physically and psychosocially. Unfortunately, in Pakistan, adolescents have long remained a neglected target group for health and nutrition interventions.\nAccording to the National Nutrition Survey 2018, more than half (54.7 percent) of adolescent girls are anaemic, leading to short-term effects such as illness, fatigue, lethargy, and poor concentration, as well as long-term impacts including impaired cognitive development and reduced work capacity. These consequences undermine both academic achievement and human capital development.\nThe project, designed specifically to address the anaemia burden, was implemented with close collaboration from the World Food Programme (WFP) across six districts in Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Gilgit-Baltistan, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir.\nIt leveraged BISP’s Benazir Nashonuma Programme (BNP) through facilitation centers established at government hospitals—mainly DHQs and THQs—to reach the most vulnerable adolescent girls. It specifically targeted daughters of BNP beneficiaries, with particular focus on out-of-school girls.\nThe model combined provision of WIFAS, nutrition education, and conditional cash transfers. Parents received cash transfers on the condition that their daughters regularly consumed WIFAS and participated in nutrition education sessions.\nThe successful completion of this pilot marks an important step toward integrating nutrition into Pakistan’s social protection system. With strong evidence and collaboration, BISP, Nutrition International, and other key partners have committed to scaling up this model to improve the health and nutrition of adolescent girls nationwide.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
