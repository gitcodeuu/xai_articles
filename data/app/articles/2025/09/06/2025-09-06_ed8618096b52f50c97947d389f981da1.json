The birth of Hazart Mustafa was that radiant moment when the gates of the heavens opened, blessings descended upon the earth, and every particle of the universe was illuminated. He stated that as Sadiq (the Truthful) and Amin (the Trustworthy), the Prophet lit the lamp of honesty and integrity in the merciless environment of Makkah.\nMohsin Naqvi said that with the advent of Prophethood Hazarat Muhammad, every idol of ignorance was shattered and humanity was shown the path of truth and wisdom.

He emphasized that The Prophet  gave a model social and economic system which remains a guiding light for the entire world. He highlighted that Hazat Muhammad made the mosque not only a center of worship but also a source of training, justice, and love.\nThe Interior Minister said that the Prophet’s mercy towards slaves, orphans, and the weak stands as a pillar of the eternal system of justice. He added that on the day of the conquest of Makkah, the Holy Prophet elevated humanity to new heights by forgiving his enemies.\nMohsin Naqvi said that, unfortunately, the Muslim Ummah has forgotten the radiant teachings of the Holy Prophet, and this is the fundamental cause of its decline.

He stressed that the 12th of Rabi-ul-Awwal is a day of renewal of the pledge that we make the Seerah of the Holy Prophet the guiding mirror of our lives.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
