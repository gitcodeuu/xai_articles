We call upon the international community to play its role in addressing the humanitarian plight of the civilians and to hold Israel accountable,” he remarked.\nHe said, “Pakistan reaffirms its unwavering support for the Palestinian people in their just struggle for self-determination and for a sovereign, independent Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.",
