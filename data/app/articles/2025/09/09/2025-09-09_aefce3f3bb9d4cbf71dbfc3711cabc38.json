The media’s role in creating awareness and building trust is critical to its success.”\nHealth officials, including Dr. Sardar Manzoor (PPM AJK), Dr. Syeda Rashida (DHO ICT), and Dr. Irsha Jokhio (DHS CDA), underlined the importance of provincial and district-level ownership in ensuring equitable vaccine access. A technical session led by Dr. Khurram Akram (FDI) and supported by gynecologists and immunization experts shed light on cervical cancer’s burden, vaccine safety, delivery strategies, and community mobilization.\nAreej Javid, Communications Coordinator, Jhpiego, emphasized effective media advocacy: “The media is not just a channel of information—it is a bridge of trust. By sharing factual, clear, and compassionate messages, journalists can help ensure vaccine acceptance among families and communities.”\nAdding to this, Zunash Abbasi of UNICEF noted the need for responsible reporting: “Crisis communication is about timeliness, accuracy, and empathy. The media’s role is vital in countering misinformation and building confidence.”\nPakistan faces an alarming burden of cervical cancer, with around 5,008 women diagnosed annually and more than 3,000 deaths, making it the third most common cancer among women of all ages and the second most common among women of reproductive age. Globally, HPV types 16 and 18 account for nearly 70% of cervical cancer cases, which the vaccine can effectively prevent.\nThe phased rollout will begin in Punjab, Sindh, Islamabad Capital Territory, and Azad Jammu & Kashmir in 2025, followed by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in 2026, and Balochistan and Gilgit-Baltistan in 2027.\nAt the conclusion of the event, partners reiterated their commitment to aligning Pakistan’s efforts with WHO’s Global Strategy to eliminate cervical cancer. Officials stressed that through vaccination, awareness campaigns, and community mobilization, Pakistan is determined to safeguard the health and future of its girls and women.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
