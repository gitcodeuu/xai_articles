This has reduced support for climate-related initiatives, making self-reliance increasingly necessary,” he said.\nHe added that for developing nations like Pakistan, which are already facing severe climate impacts, building such self-reliance remains a major challenge.\nDr. Malik also unveiled the Ministry’s upcoming two-pronged strategy. The first priority, he said, is to strengthen “traditional competence” by enhancing Pakistan’s ability to secure climate funds and design projects that deliver tangible benefits, particularly for rural and marginalized communities.\nThe second focus, described as “non-traditional competence,” will support youth-led green startups and empower young innovators to create sustainable solutions.\nAmbassador O’Neill praised Pakistan’s efforts and underlined Ireland’s interest in collaborating on renewable energy, green innovation, and sustainable development.\n“Ireland looks forward to working with Pakistan on areas of shared concern, particularly where young people can play a leading role in shaping climate solutions,” she said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
