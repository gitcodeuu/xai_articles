Acknowledging the explanation, Senator Kamil Ali Agha decided that the Chairman NHA would be given another opportunity to present the department’s position before the Sub-Committee in its next meeting.\nAmong those who were present were Senator Saifullah Abro and senior officials from the concerned department.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
