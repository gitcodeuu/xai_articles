She clarified that BISP surveys and registrations are entirely free, and any demand for fees or forms is fraudulent. The beneficiaries were advised to keep their CNIC, children’s B-Forms, electricity bill, and vaccination records ready during surveys.\nShe further instructed that only personal mobile numbers should be registered, with immediate reporting of any changes to BISP.\nSenator Rubina Khalid reiterated that once a survey is completed, it cannot be repeated for at least two years.\nShe urged beneficiaries to always count their full payment at the time of receipt and, in case of deductions or complaints, contact the BISP helpline at 0800-26477 or visit the nearest BISP office.\nConcluding the session, the Chairperson directed officials to ensure immediate resolution of all pending complaints-including the Muzaffargarh case-and submit reports directly to her.\nShe reaffirmed that BISP is committed to public welfare and that negligence at any level will not be tolerated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
