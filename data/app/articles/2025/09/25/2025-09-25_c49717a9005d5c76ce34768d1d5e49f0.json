At a time when mistrust and geopolitical rivalries are intensifying, mediation must be revitalized as a cornerstone of preventive diplomacy. He said, “For Pakistan, mediation is not just an abstract principle but a coveted goal, as we live in a region where unresolved disputes continue to fester. The Jammu and Kashmir dispute remains one of the oldest items on the agenda of the UN Security Council.”",
