He lauded the participation of young leaders from across Pakistan — including Balochistan, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit-Baltistan — and praised their determination, calling it “commendable.”\nHighlighting the govt’s commitment to merit, Mashhood recalled that in the past the Chief Minister Shehbaz Sharif eliminated the “booti mafia” and nepotism culture in Punjab, enabling talented students to succeed. “A girl from Yazman topped her exams despite being the first in her family to study beyond matriculation. This is what happens when a fair system supports talent,” he noted.\nHe further underlined Pakistan’s recognition on the international stage, referring to the recent defense agreement with Saudi Arabia. “This is a positive development, and protecting Saudi Arabia is now our responsibility,” he remarked.\nThe summit featured a Training of Trainers (ToT) supported by UNFPA and Canada, where 92 members of the National Youth Council were trained in leadership, climate action, health, and gender equality. Sessions also included a debate on “Climate Justice and Resilience,” a panel on “Life Skills and Reproductive Health Education,” and creative performances highlighting youth aspirations.\nMubashir Banuri, CEO of Act International, shared that his organization has reached over 4.6 million individuals, trained 3,000 teachers, supported 34,000 youth through helplines, and empowered 1,100 transgender individuals through life skills initiatives. He stressed that youth are the true guarantors of a sustainable future.\nConcluding his address, Rana Mashhood urged all stakeholders to channel the energy of Pakistan’s youth into nation-building. “Pakistan’s youth are not just participants in the nation’s journey — they are its driving force, ready to lead globally,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
