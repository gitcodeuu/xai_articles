Community ownership is at the heart of sustainable solutions.”\nPanelists shared diverse insights. Dr. Abida Sharif, Assistant Professor at FJWU, called for stronger integration of environmental responsibility into education: “Academia has a vital role in preparing the next generation to see waste as an opportunity. Youth, especially students, can be powerful changemakers.”\nSpeaking from civil society, WWF-Pakistan, Rafia Mahmood, stressed the importance of collaboration: “The lessons from our work with communities show that partnerships between government, civil society, and grassroots actors are essential for scaling up impact.”\nRepresenting the community, a leader from Farash Town, Yasmeen Akhtar, shared lived realities: “We have seen shifts in behavior, but communities need consistent support and institutional backing.
