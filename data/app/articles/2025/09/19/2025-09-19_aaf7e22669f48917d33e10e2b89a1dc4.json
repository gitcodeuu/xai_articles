  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 19 (APP): Gwadar is set to witness a major leap in its marine economy as the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR) has announced to establish a state-of-the-art Marine Innovation Lab at its Precision System Training Centre (PSTC).\nThe initiative is aimed at introducing high-tech boat manufacturing and modernizing the city’s traditional fishing industry, regarded as the backbone of local livelihoods, said a press release.\nAccording to official documents available with Wealth Pakistan, the proposed Marine Innovation Lab will focus on building CNC precision and composite boats, along with developing sustainable fiberglass boats through computer numerical control (CNC) technology.\nBy integrating advanced manufacturing with local craftsmanship, the facility is expected to provide a major boost to Gwadar’s fishing sector and maritime economy.\nThe planned expansion comes as part of PSTC’s broader mission to create a skilled workforce for Gwadar’s emerging industries under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\nEstablished through a memorandum of understanding (MoU) between PCSIR and the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC), the centre has already started producing trained manpower to meet industrial demands.\nAt present, a total of 68 students from less-developed areas of Balochistan are enrolled at the Gwadar training facility. The PSTC offers both long- and short-term courses, including a three-year Diploma of Associate Engineering (DAE) in Precision Mechanics and Instrument Technology, as well as six-month programs in graphic design, machinist training, and general electrician skills.\nSo far, 50 graduates have completed their studies through short courses and are already contributing to the local job market by filling technical roles in Gwadar’s industrial setup. Another 18 students are currently pursuing the three-year diploma program, which is designed to prepare them for highly specialized technical positions.\nTo ensure wider participation of youth from remote and disadvantaged areas, the PSTC provides hostel accommodation with a capacity of up to 80 students.\nA senior official at the centre told Wealth Pakistan that the Marine Innovation Lab is expected to serve as a game-changer for Gwadar’s fishing economy. “By bringing CNC technology into boat-making, we will not only enhance the durability and safety of fishing vessels but also make them more competitive in local and regional markets. This will uplift the livelihoods of fishing communities while adding value to the city’s marine economy,” he said.\nHe further noted that the project complements Pakistan’s broader efforts to strengthen its human capital base for long-term economic growth. “Equipping the youth of Balochistan with employable skills is central to bridging the regional skill gap. This centre is ensuring that local talent is ready to match the demands of industries developing in Gwadar under CPEC,” he added.",
