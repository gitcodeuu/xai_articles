After completing the online submission, they are required to print the application form—bearing the computerized number—and forward it to the Ministry of Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony within five days of online submission. The printed form must be verified by the head or principal of the applicant’s institution.\nThe application must include attested copies of the student’s marks sheet and progress report from the most recent examination. Students following the GPA system are required to submit relevant academic documents issued by their institutions.

The head of the institution must verify all submitted documents, including academic records and the financial status of the student’s family. Applicants currently benefiting from any other scholarship program are not eligible to apply.\nApplication forms can be downloaded from the official website: www.mora.org.pk.
