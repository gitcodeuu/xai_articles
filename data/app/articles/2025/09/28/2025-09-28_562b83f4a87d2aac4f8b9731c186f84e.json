A total of 265 locations were examined in detail. During these inspections, larvae were detected at six sites, while 15 other locations were declared clear after testing.\nField teams have intensified their efforts in areas identified as high-risk. Spraying and fogging were immediately carried out in these locations to prevent further breeding of mosquitoes.\nThe surveillance report confirmed that out of the 36 new dengue cases recorded in a single day, 25 patients belong to rural areas of the capital, while 11 were reported from urban zones. This distribution indicates that rural localities continue to be more affected compared to urban neighborhoods.\nThe district administration has stated that data collection and monitoring are being maintained daily to keep track of rising cases and ensure timely interventions.\nThe administration also took strict action against violations of dengue prevention standard operating procedures (SOPs). Several individuals were arrested for negligence, while multiple premises were sealed after larvae were found on their sites. Officials stressed that enforcement measures would continue alongside awareness campaigns to reduce the risk of an outbreak.\nAuthorities urged residents to immediately report any sighting of mosquito larvae or stagnant water to the district control room. They emphasized that timely reporting by citizens plays a vital role in supporting ongoing field operations and helps in containing the spread of the virus.\nThe administration further added that eliminating larvae at the early stage is one of the most effective strategies to control dengue. Community participation in maintaining clean surroundings, removing stagnant water, and allowing teams to inspect properties is considered essential.\nThe district administration assured that daily field inspections, larvae removal, and spraying drives will continue without interruption. Anti-dengue squads are expected to expand their coverage in the coming days to ensure maximum surveillance in both urban and rural regions.\nOfficials reiterated that controlling dengue requires a consistent approach, combining enforcement, public awareness, and rapid response measures. With new cases being reported daily, uninterrupted monitoring has become a critical part of the city’s health safety strategy.\nThe situation continues to be closely monitored, with special attention to high-risk union councils and sectors. Authorities emphasized that with consistent vigilance and public support, the spread of dengue in the capital can be brought under control.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
