The government had also initiated efforts to make the senate elections transparent, he said.\nThe masses have witnessed the by-elections conducted in the past but they were happy since PTI took over, he said adding, ECP was working as an independent institution and they have great respect for their decisions.\nThe minister emphasized on electoral reforms to avoid such issues in the future for which constitutional amendment was introduced but not accepted by the opposition.\nPrime Minister, Imran Khan had been encouraging all such initiatives which were crucial for ensuring utmost transparency in the elections. “We are heading towards the principle of transparency”, he said.\nThe federal minister stated that introducing electronic voting machine was also an effort to ensure transparent election on which his ministry was working diligently.",
