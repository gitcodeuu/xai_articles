Besides, Tony Lloyd MP and Rebecca Long Bailey MP sent their messages of solidarity.\nEarlier giving an overview of the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK), President AJK Sardar Masood Khan said that Indian Occupied Kashmir had become a hotspot of Islamophobia, and Kashmiris were facing annihilation and genocide.\nRape and targeted molestation of women by occupation forces was being used as a tool to intimidate the population. The BJP government was bringing millions of Hindus to the occupied territory to change its demography in contravention of the international law and Geneva Convention.\nHe urged the British government to activate the UN to resolve the conflict, which was eroding peace and security of the region.\nIn his opening remarks, the High Commissioner apprised the audience of the unabated atrocities being committed by the Indian security forces in IIOJK.\nHe said that nearly a million armed occupation forces were violating the fundamental rights of innocent and unarmed Kashmiris at a scale unparalleled in modern times. Indian atrocities betray the genocidal intent, reminiscent of the worst excesses of fascism in the Second World War.\nHe called upon the UK government to play its due role in bringing the humanitarian crisis and the political dispute to a peaceful and just conclusion, in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.\nPakistan on its part will continue to raise its voice for the Kashmiris at every platform and every occasion, the High Commissioner concluded.\nAt the end, the High Commissioner thanked the speakers and participants of the webinar for their expression of solidarity with the Kashmiris.
