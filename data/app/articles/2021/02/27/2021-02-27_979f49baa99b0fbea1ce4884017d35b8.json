In case of any misadventure, our response would be swift, resolute and unwavering.”\nA documentary was also screened on the occasion highlighting the circumstances leading to an Indian Air Force airstrike at Balakot and its subsequent rapid response by the PAF in the shape of Operation Swift Retort leaving Indian forces badly humiliated and defeated in the encounter. Former Air Chiefs and a large number of PAF officials witnessed the ceremony.\nEarlier, a smartly turned out contingent of Pakistan Air Force presented the Guard of Honour.\nAnother important event of the ceremony was a spectacular fly past by two formations of PAF fighter aircraft including F-16, JF-17, F-7 and Mirage.  The ceremony was rounded off with soulful performance by the young students of Fazaia School and College.\nDirector General Inter Services Public Relations (DG ISPR) Major General Babar Iftikhar said February 27, 2019 was the testament that Pakistan Armed Forces, with support of the nation, would always defend the motherland against all threats.\n27th Feb, 2019  is testament that Pak AF, with support of the nation, will always defend the motherland against all threats. It is not  numbers but courage & will of a resilient nation that triumphs in the end. Pak stands 4 peace but when challenged, shall respond with full might\n— DG ISPR (@OfficialDGISPR) February 27, 2021\nIn a tweet, he said it was not the numerical strength of the armed forces that gave nation dominance over its adversary in wars rather the valour and determination of a resilient nation that achieves victory in the end.\n“It is not the numbers but courage and will of a resilient nation that triumphs in the end.”\nMajor General Babar Iftikhar further said: “Pakistan stands for peace but when challenged, shall respond with full might.”\nMinister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz said that February 27 was the day of pride and glory for the entire Pakistani nation.\nIn a tweet, the minister said that the hawks of Pakistan Air Force thwarted the enemy’s evil designs and raised the head of the entire nation with pride.\n27 فروری پوری پاکستانی قوم کی سربلندی اور سرفرازی کا دن ہے۔ پاک فضائیہ کے شاہینوں نے شب خون مارنے والے  دشمن کو دن میں تارے دکھائے اور پوری قوم کا سر فخر سے بلند کیا۔پاکستان خطے میں امن کا داعی ہے لیکن کسی بھی جارحیت کا منہ توڑ جواب دینے کی بھرپور صلاحیت رکھتا ہے۔\n— Senator Shibli Faraz (@shiblifaraz) February 27, 2021\nShibli Faraz said that Pakistan was a proponent of peace in the region but was fully capable of responding to any aggression.\nForeign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan wanted to resolve its issues with India through peaceful dialogue and desired resolution of the Kashmir dispute according to the United Nations Security Council resolutions.\nIn a televised statement, he said, “We have to find solution to our core issues. We have to find a way through peaceful dialogue.”\nPakistan wanted dialogue with India but it could not ignore the human right violations of Kashmiris and wanted talks on the Kashmir issue in line with the UN Security Council resolutions, he added.\nThe minister said Pakistan had no aggressive designs but if the Balakot like episodes were repeated, Pakistan knew how to defend itself.\nOn February 26, 2019, he said India attacked Pakistan, crossed our borders and bombed Balakot and told the world that it attacked a militant camp and killed about 300 terrorists.\nToday the facts were before the world that there was no militant camp and no terrorists were killed there. It was a drama staged for political objectives and for success in the elections and to retake the lost status in politics, he noted.\nSpecial Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on National Security, Dr Moeed Yusuf said the nation came together on February 27, two years ago, and showed the world capability and resolve to defend sovereignty of the country.\nOn 27th Feb, two years ago, the nation came together and showed the world our capability and resolve to defend our sovereignty. I especially salute our brave soldiers, sailors and airmen whose tireless vigil keeps our people safe and defends every inch of our homeland.\n— Moeed W. Yusuf (@YusufMoeed) February 27, 2021\nIn a tweet, the SAPM presented his salute to the armed forces’ personnel ensuring people’s safety and security of every inch of the motherland.\nHe said: “I especially salute our brave soldiers, sailors and airmen whose tireless vigil keeps our people safe and defends every inch of our homeland.”",
