  "content": "MIRPUR [AJK]: Feb 03 (APP): AJK President Sardar Masood Khan emphasized on Wednesday that the Kashmir movement must be transformed into a global political and people’s movement.\nPakistani and Kashmiri political leadership, including the AJK President Sardar Masood Khan, unanimously called upon the people from Peshawar to Karachi and Gilgit to Gwadar to take to streets on February 5 to convey a strong message to their brethren in occupied Jammu and Kashmir that they are not alone in their valiant struggle against India’s fascism and terrorism.\nThe call came from the AJK President Sardar Masood Khan, Amir Jamaat Islami Pakistan Senator Sirajul Haq, Chairman Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Raja Zafarul Haq, Jamiyat Ahle Hadith chief Senator Prof Sajid Mir, Amir Jamaat Islami Azad Kashmir Dr Khalid Mehmood and former Amir Abdur Rashid Turabi, during a national conference on Kashmir organized by Jamaat Islami Pakistan in the federal capital, AJK President office.\nAddressing the conference, the state president Sardar Masood Khan said that in spite of all out political differences, leaders of all political parties of Pakistan, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan have a unanimous stand on the Kashmir issue.\nThe entire Pakistani nation and people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir would practically demonstrate this unanimity on Friday in order to convey a message to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the days of his illegal and illegitimate occupation of Kashmir are numbered, and the whole Pakistani nation stands united with their Kashmiri brethren, and their unity will culminate in the freedom of occupied Kashmir and the defeat of so-called Hindutva ideology, Masood said.\nHe maintained that to stop India from changing demography of occupied Kashmir was a major challenge for the whole Pakistani nation, and this is possible only when the whole nation unanimously conveys the voice of Kashmiri people across the globe.\n“Our main agenda should be the demographic transformation taking place in IIOJK. This is a crucial issue as Hindus are being imported from all over India to settle them in the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir,” he added..\nSaying that Kashmiris in IOJK are fighting a war for the integrity of Pakistan, AJK President said the only option to frustrate designs of the Indian fanatics against the existence of Pakistan is to support the brothers and sisters in the occupied territory because they are fighting the war not only for our survival but this is also our religious and moral obligation to support them.\nSardar Masood Khan appreciated more than 600 MPs who have been presenting resolutions of condemnations against the Indian actions, in the European Parliament since August 5, 2019. Our political parties should contact them to not only thank them, but also seek more cooperation from them.\n“It is high time that we bring a change in our strategy on Kashmir and transform the Kashmir issue into an international political and peoples movement.in order to compel the decision-making bodies of the world to speak in favor of the Kashmiri people,” he said.\nWe must keep in mind that the United Nations’ Security Council or its Human Rights Commission will not offer Kashmir to us in a silver platter.\nWe should take the baton and lead the struggle for liberty of the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe core responsibility lies with us in this regard, Khan asserted.",
