Otherwise, those people making accusations should present evidence against their claims.”\nHe said Army had the biggest responsibility of security and safeguarding of the motherland and was busy in dispensing its duties in this regard.\nMajor General Babar categorically denied any indirect contact with any political leader and said: “Please do not drag into this.\nIt’s inappropriate to comment on political matters and linking it to the Army without any proof or research. All such hearsay must come to an end now.”",
