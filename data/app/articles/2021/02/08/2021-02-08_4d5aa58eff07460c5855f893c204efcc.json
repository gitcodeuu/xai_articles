  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 8 (APP):Minister for Inter Provincial Coordination, Dr Fehmida Mirza on Monday asked the Sindh government to disclose details of utilizing funds of Rs.360 billion provided by federal government.\nAfter the 18th Amendment, the provincial governments were responsible to transfer the powers to low level, she stated in an interview with a private television channel.\nThe amount given through national finance commission (NFC), award to provinces was also unfounded, she lamented. Expressing dismay over weak policies and lethargic attitude of the provincial government, she said the people of interior Sindh are depriving of basic necessities of life and seeking clean drinking water in their respective parts of living.\nIn reply to a question, she said it was strange that Chief Minister Sindh was unaccountable to head of the state.",
