The government has also released funds for roads’ repair, he added.\nIt was a time to collectively serve the masses as the incumbent government inherited the province in a chaotic state of affairs as the past rulers left a bankrupted province, he deplored.\nThe institutions portrayed a picture of maladministration, deterioration and neglect, he regretted. The incumbent government has streamlined things with hard work and institutions were given liberty to perform by putting an end to political interference, the CM added.\nHe said everything was being done on merit and special attention was being paid to resolve public problems, added the CM.\nThe delegation thanked the CM for according respect and honour to the parliamentarians and appreciated that their proposals were given due importance.",
