Thanks to Prime Minister Imran and KP Government who deserve appreciation for addressing our longstanding issue of health services,” he said.\nQaiser Nadeem, another attendant said his brother-in-law was admitted to LRH he was availing free medical facility. “It is great favor to the poor people in the province.”\nTo run the program successfully, the KP Government has allocated over Rs18 billion in budget 2020-21 to ensure uninterrupted medical services to millions of inhabitants. All people having computerized national identity card (CNIC) with KP’s permanent address are entitled.\n“Perhaps nobody can feel the pain which I had gone through when I was diagnosed cancer. I had spent my entire hard-earned money on treatment of the deadly disease, said Khurshid Khan, a cancer patient from Nowshera.\n“It gave me immense pleasure that thousands of patients like me were now entitled for free treatment under health plus card.”\nHe said provision of free treatment up to Rs one million for a cancer patient is a considerable amount being extended by PTI government for which people like me are grateful to Prime Minister Imran Khan and KP Government.\nBesides cancer patients, kidney transplant, heart and others chronic patients were now getting free healthcare services.\nIt was long awaited and it was direly needed, but could not be done by previous regimes over the decades. However, it is hallmark of the PTI government that went for such a marvelous initiative to mitigate sufferings of hundreds of thousands people in the province.",
