But we also firmly believe that whatever the international situation and whatever India does, the people of Jammu and Kashmir will continue their struggle to get their freedom and liberty,” Khan said.\nSardar Masood Khan recounted that the Kashmiri people had got rid of the slavery of Maharaja’s regime, and now they have been fighting against India and shedding their blood for freedom for the last 73 years. No power on the earth can deter them from seeking freedom and liberty.\nTouching upon the situation of occupied Kashmir, the state president said that the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had not only waged a war against the Kashmiri people but is also importing hundreds of thousands of Hindus from all over India to settle them in Kashmir.\nHe (Modi) has planned to add six to seven million Hindus to the existing Kashmiri population of 14 million in order to turn the Muslim majority into a minority.\nLater, the AJK president visited Indus Hospital Karachi, and besides examining modern medical facilities being provided to the poor patients there met the staff and patients of the hospital.\nHe noted that Indus Hospital had laid a network of its health facilities throughout the country including Azad Kashmir, where besides providing medical facilities to the poor and deserving people, awareness is created across the country about communicable and non-communicable diseases, which is a great national service.",
