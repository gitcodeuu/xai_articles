Unfortunately, the difference of opinion turned into enmity.\nHe underlined the need of students characterization, enabling them to listen and bear others opinion.\nHe said that the relationship between political parties and students unions had bad results, adding we are not against the students unions. We were in process of formulating new policy regarding students unions, making them more effective for country’s development, he added.\nThe minister hoped for the improvement in the COVID-19 situation in the country.\nThe conference was also attended by the 22 Vice Chancellors of other universities.",
