We have great potential to deliver to the world and we should not be overwhelmed by any challenges.”\nAddressing the conference, Dr Steffen Kudella, Resident Representative of HSF Pakistan said an algorithm was a mechanistic formula that automatically produced an answer for each new case that appeared.\n“This happens with no or with very minimal human intervention. Algorithms are marking the current age of technology. However, algorithms face serious limitations,” he added.\nDr. Steffen said Artificial Intelligence was still far away from having real super-human abilities, and it was important not only to see its potential, but also the limitations.\nHe said as it was unlikely that the AI would be able to replace human beings completely, the later should adjust their skills through education and training as per the needs of future society.\nReplying to a question posed by APP about the scope of digitalization, he said Pakistan, with a young and tech-savvy population and a high rate of smartphone penetration, had immense potential for technological transformation especially when it came to the digital economy.\n“Pakistan’s digital landscape is a thriving one and it was one of the few sectors to grow despite the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020,” he added.\nPakistan, he said, needed to embrace the latest technological innovations and ride the digital wave to economic and social prosperity through IT friendly policies and enabling legislation.
