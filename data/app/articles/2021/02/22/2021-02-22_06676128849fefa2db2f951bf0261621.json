The first part will have election symbols while the second will be with the presiding officer.\nChaudhry Fawad said that only the presiding officer would be able to turn on the machine and voters would be able to cast their vote by clicking on any symbol through the machine.\nHe said clicking on the election symbol would be an electric vote cast.\n“Not only electric vote casting can be done through the machine but also ballot paper can be printed”, he said.\nHe said that the machine is also electric and can be used for casting votes on ballot papers.\nThe minister announced that the work on the electronic voting machine was in final stages and this machine would be shared with the National Database Registration Authority, National University of Science and Technology and COMSATS soon.\nHe said that the Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Institute of Electronics had done a great job by developing such a machine.\nThe machine has been developed as per directives of the Prime Minister, Imran Khan to ensure fair and transparent elections.\nIt is necessary to convert to the electronic voting system to avoid what happened in Daska and other places in the recent by-elections.",
