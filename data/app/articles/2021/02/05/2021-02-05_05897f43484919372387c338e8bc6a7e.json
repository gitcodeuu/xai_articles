They were chanting slogans against the Indian act of genocide in occupied area and silence of the international community on it.\nJI Secretary General Ameerul Azim addressed the gathering in Mandi Bahauddin while JI Naib Emir Liaqat Baloch headed the rally in Karachi.\nSenator Siraj further said that the nation would never allow India to keep occupy even a single inch land of the jugular vein of Pakistan. Thousands of Kashmiris have lost their lives for the cause since 1947, he added.\nThe JI chief paid homage to the patience and determination of the Kashmiri leadership and youth who had been bearing worst torture and atrocities of the occupied forces for decades but were not ready to bow before them. Kashmir and Pakistan were indispensable for each other, he said.\nSenator Sirajul Haq asked the international community to play a responsible role realizing the sensitivity of the issue and force New Delhi to call back its army from the occupied area and allow the people of Kashmir to exercise their right to self-determination granted to them through various UN resolutions. He said Indian hegemonic designs were the serious threat to the peace of the region.",
