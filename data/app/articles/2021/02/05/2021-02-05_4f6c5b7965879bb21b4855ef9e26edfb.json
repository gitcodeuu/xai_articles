You may indeed hold a long march if you want so. I will help you wherever you want to hold long march. But (I) will not give NRO even if you hang upside down,” the prime minister said.\nAddressing a public gathering in connection with Kashmir Solidarity Day here, the prime minister said that he was ready to talk to all sorts of mindsets and ideologies but will never compromise for an NRO to the looters.\nThe prime minister’s remarks came as the Pakistan Democratic Movement gathered in Muzaffarabad in connection with Kashmir Solidarity Day but instead of Kashmir issue, the criticism of Prime Minister Imran Khan dominated in the speeches of the opposition leaders.\nLIVE #APPNews : Prime Minister Imran Khan addressing public gathering in #Kotli AJK on #KashmirSolidarityDay . #PMIKStandsWithKashmir @PakPMO #یوم_یکجہتی_کشمیر https://t.co/tW2pkAp6tx\n— APP  (@appcsocialmedia) February 5, 2021\nQuoting Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), the prime minister said the nations in the history faced downfall for having discriminatory laws for rich and poor.\nHe said he would never tolerate to put people involved in petty theft behind bars and grant NRO to the big thieves.\nEarlier, addressing the gathering, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi also defended the prime minister against opposition’s criticism alleging him of undermining the Kashmir cause.\nRather, he said Imran Khan internationalized and raised the issue forcefully which was otherwise put on the backburners by the previous governments.\nEven, he said, the previous rulers were hesitant to talk of Kashmir issue.
