  "content": "KARACHI, Feb 05 (APP): Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah on Friday said Indian authorities have imposed the longest curfew in the history of Kashmir which was a sheer violation of human rights (HR) and a solid proof of their inhuman behaviour for international human rights bodies.\nHe stated this while talking to media after leading a rally to express solidarity with the people of Kashmir organized by Commissioner Karachi from Peoples Chowrangi to\nMazar-e-Quid.\nThe rally was attended by provincial ministers, Saeed Ghani, Murtaza Wahab, IGP Sindh, provincial secretaries, civil society, human rights activists and others in a large number.\nMurad Ali Shah said the Indian government, to suppress people of Kashmir, had not only amended their constitution to deny the historical rights of people of the valley, but had turned the valley into a no-go-area where no person was allowed to enter for witnessing the plight of the people.\n“In the history, the curfew imposed in Kashmir is the longest ever imposed anywhere in the world,” he said.\nThe CM said the conferences, walks and seminars to highlight the plight of people of Kashmir were good but they would have to make some tangible efforts on diplomatic forums to force India for restoring status of Kashmir, lift curfew from the valley and allow plebiscite as was decided by the United Nations.\nHe said, “Setting aside all political difference, we as a nation would have to unite on a single agenda to liberate the people of Kashmir from the clutches of Indian government”.\nThe Chief Minister said the atrocities unleashed in the valley of Kashmir was a threat to the regional peace.\n“If the international community is interested in the peace in the region it would have to take notice of Modi government’s crimes in Kashmir and force him to restore the rights of suppressed people of Kashmir by withdrawing heavy police and armed forces from the valley.”\nMurad Ali Shah urged the international community to become the voice of the voiceless people of Kashmir.\nHe also assured people of Kashmir that the people of Pakistan were with them and would be fighting for their legitimate rights.",
