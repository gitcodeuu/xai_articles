All ARE induction would be based on the outputs of the IGCEP, he added.\nHe said a Steering Committee comprising of Power Division, AEDB and all four provinces and support by National Transmission and Dispatch Company (NTDC) and Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA-G) would be responsible for making annual procurement plans.\nPower purchase and interconnection commitments from CPPA and NTDC would be in place before the bidding process, he added.\nHe said the past government abandoned 4000 MW RE projects and promoted projects based on imported fuel. Earlier, solar projects were awarded at Rs. 22 per unit and now the rate is around Rs.5.65 per unit.\nThe government only ensured transparency in awarding contracts of various power projects and will save Rs. 4000 billion in energy sector.\nThe consumption of electricity in industrial sector witnessed increase of 17 percent in January owing to incentive given by the government to the industrial sector, and overall 28 percent increase was registered in consumption of electricity because of terminating peak and off peak hours factor.\nOmar Ayub said an investment of Rs. 47 billion has been made in the transmission system of NTDC during the last 2 and half years while Rs. 74 billion were invested in the distribution system.\nHe said 80 per cent feeders were already cleared from load-management while remaining 20 percent feeders were being cleared.\nThe minister said the government also auctioned 15 new blocks for exploration of new oil and gas reserves while the work is under process on Pak-Russia Gas Pipeline project.\nSpecial Assistant to the PM on Power Tabish Gohar said negotiation are underway with the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and over Rs. 700 billion would be saved once the process is completed while an amount of Rs. 850 billion was paid under the capacity payment in one year.\nGohar said that Professional and competent CEOs, Board of Directors and members were being hired through transparent manner in the distribution companies.\nPunjab Energy Minister Akhtar Malik said the provincial government has a clear vision about the RE adding that clean and green energy is being added to the system.\nHe said the provincial government has shifted 10,500 government schools on solar energy and now all the basic health units are being switched to solar energy in next stage.\nThe minister said the Punjab government has a plan to shift all public sector universities on solar system besides converting all public connections on solar energy in near future.\nHe lauded the Zhenfa Pakistan New Energy Company for setting up 100 MW solar power plants in Layyah district and said that it would further expedite economic activities in the remote area.\nIn his welcome address, CEO AEDB Shahjahan Mirza said the four solar projects have achieved a financial closure in a record time which reflected the government commitment for promoting the RE in the country.\nSAPM to PM on Petroleum Nadeem Babar, Secretary Power Ali Raza Bhutta, NEPRA senior officials, Ambassador of Norway and other dignitaries were also present in the ceremony.",
