He questioned whether we are also waiting for burning alive of detained Kashmiri youth in gas chambers.\n“Today is the 23rd of February and it is a dark day in the history of Kashmir; I dedicate this day to the victims of rape, a crime that was committed in the early 1990s in Kunan Poshspora, where women were cordoned off by the Indian armed personals and were raped on mass; the youngest victims were 5 years old and the oldest was 80; many of those who are still alive and have scars on their bodies and minds,” Sardar Masood Khan said.\nHe added that the mass rape was committed to punish entire Kashmiri nation because they were Muslims and they had not given a right to India to determine their statehood or political future.\nHe believed that Pakistanis should stop showing helplessness, and give a clear message of punishing India for its heinous crimes in Kashmir.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Vice-Chancellor Prof. Dr Asghar Zaidi laid stress on promoting research on Kashmir in Pakistan universities, saying that GCU was going to establish a Center of Excellence in Kashmir Studies very soon.\nProf. Zaidi expressed profound gratitude to the students of GCU Debating Society, Dramatics Club and Music Society for making very reassuring and heartening presentations on contemporary situations of their Kashmiri brothers and sisters.\nNewly-elected senator Dr Zarqa Suharwardy briefed the students about the history of Kashmir dispute. Academician Prof Zafar Iqbal Sindhu also spoke.\nP:ahr/X:ftp/L:adn/E:adn/I:sqz/R:sqz",
