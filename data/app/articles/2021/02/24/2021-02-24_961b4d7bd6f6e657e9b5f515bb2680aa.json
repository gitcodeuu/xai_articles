But hope will not be restored by the vaccine alone,” said an official of the UNICEF.\nThe countries needed urgent technical and financial support to strengthen their capacities for cold supply chains, train healthcare workers, and work with communities in combating misinformation and building trust in vaccines, he added.\nThe Official worried that without urgent funding and support, many of the poorest countries still risk to be left behind to overcome the contagion outbreak.\nThe Covid-19 vaccine availability, logistics and safe administration has become an uphill task in the prevailing environment of misinformation, propaganda, crumbling economies due to lockdown and public indifference to get vaccinated, he added.",
