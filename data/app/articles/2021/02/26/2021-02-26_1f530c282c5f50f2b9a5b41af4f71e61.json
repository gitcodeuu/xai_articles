He said that Indian media had raised a hue and cry about this marriage. The minister said that JUI-F should explain its position on the issue.\nHe said that cruelty was cruelty wherever it took place and it was not right to say that legislators could not talk about oppression in the Sindh province.\nOpposition leader in the Sindh Assembly was facing brutality of the Sindh government, he added.\nCh Fawad Hussain said that snake was released in the cell of jail where opposition leader was kept.\nHe said that this kind of treatment was a human rights issue and notice should be taken of this incident.\n“We all may be having differences with each other but it does not mean that opponents should be put in jail,” he commented.\nAs the minister was speaking, MNA Agha Rafiullah of Pakistan Peoples Party pointed out the quorum.\nAfter counting, due to lack of quorum Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser adjourned the house to meet again on Monday at 4 p.m.",
