  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 25 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz Thursday said it was a matter of pride for the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) that today the state institutions were free and independent.\n“We respect the decisions of institutions. We are trying to hold elections on whose transparency no one can point a finger,” he said while talking to media persons along with PTI leader Usman Dar after the Election Commission Pakistan announced its order for re-polling in the NA-75 Daska.\nThe ECP had issued a short order and the PTI would review the legal options in consultation with its legal team, he added.\nThe minister said as the PTI workers, they were proud that their government had fulfilled the promise of making the institutions free. “Today, there is no pressure on the institutions, they are completely independent.”\nThe present government, he said, had the means and resources at its disposal to pressure the institutions, but it had never done so.\nOn the contrary, the previous regimes of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and other parties promoted the electoral rigging and money laundering. Their politics was based on the two menaces as firstly, rigging was done in every election held during their tenure, and secondly, money was used for horse trading, he added.\nShibli Faraz said the opposition parties considered those decisions correct which were in their favour, and when the same institutions, be it the Election Commission or the courts, ruled against them, they did not accept them.\nThey had a mindset of not accepting any loss at the hustings, and the PTI had defeated that mindset and would continue to do so, he added.\n“More important to us is the independence of institutions, we want promotion of democratic norms for the development and prosperity of the country,” he said.\nThe minister said the PML-N had always engaged in ‘politics of money and bullying’, right from Chhanga Manga till now. They had destroyed institutions and weakened democracy.\nThey knew what Rana Sanaullah, Ahsan Iqbal and Javed Latif were doing in Daska.\n“If we had to do rigging, we could have done it in Wazirabad,” he added.\nShibli Faraz said the PML-N first called for re-polling at 20 polling stations (of Daska) and then changed its stance, but the PTI would abide by the decisions of institutions.\nThe minister said Prime Minister Imran Khan wanted to make the Senate elections transparent and non-controversial. Similarly, the government would also fulfill the purpose of electronic voting to ensure transparency in the general election.\nHe said in the old Pakistan a few families and elites used to enjoy perks and privileges that ruined the country, and under the leadership of Imran Khan, such evil forces would be defeated.",
