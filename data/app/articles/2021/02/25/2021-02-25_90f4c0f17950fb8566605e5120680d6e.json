It had for the time being discontinued with the Rs 40,000 bearer bonds but those holding these bonds had been allowed to convert them by 31st May 2021.\nSpeaking on the occasion, High Commissioner Raza Bashir Tarar appreciated a keen interest shown by the fellow Pakistanis in the E-Katchehry and for asking relevant questions and offering valuable suggestions.\nHe said the E-Katchehry was a manifestation of the importance and the respect the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister of Pakistan accorded to the Pakistani Diaspora abroad as well as their role and contribution to the national development.\nHe assured the community that their concerns and suggestions for further improvement of consular services and other issues concerning their welfare would be given priority by the Mission and due diligence would be shown in addressing them promptly.",
