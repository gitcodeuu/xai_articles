  "content": "MIRPUR (AJK): Jan 15 (APP): Lauding recent debate on Kashmir Issue in the British Parliament, PTI AJK Central Information Secretary Ershad Mehmud has termed it as the mouthpiece of the wishes and aspirations of the people of Jammu & Kashmir.\nTalking to APP here on Friday, he said that it had become crystal clear through this debate that, what come may, Kashmir Issue could not be thrown in the cold storage.\nThe Secretary Information of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf AJK Chapter, continued that Jammu & Kashmir people were grateful of the British Parliamentarians who have adopted a very strong view point for the early solution of Kashmir Issue.\nErshad Mehmud said that it was a good omen that members of the British Parliament were fully aware of the problems and situation related to Kashmir.\nThe PTI AJK leader fully endorsed the British Parliamentarians’ demand that Human Rights Commission of European Union and the United Nations should be provided access at both sides of the Line Of Control (LOC) globally recognized Jammu & Kashmir state.\nSo that they could freely gather informations about the human rights and civil liberties in the state.\nErshad Mehmud underlined that exceptional tension broke out in the region since past few years as human rights were massively abused in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir state.\nBesides, he pointed out, there had been the highest volume of killings at the Line Of Control and the affected civilian population suffered huge material loss.\n“In this backdrop, debate on Kashmir in the British Parliament is considered to be of exceptional significance”, the PTI Info-secretary observed.\nErshad expressed the hope that under the dynamic leader of Joe Biden, the newly elected US Government would also contribute its due share in early peaceful solution of Kashmir Issue under the spirit of international norms and commitments.\nNew American Government should once again raise the issue of human rights and civil liberties wherever these were being denied and suppressed across the globe breaking silence of the international community, he concluded.",
