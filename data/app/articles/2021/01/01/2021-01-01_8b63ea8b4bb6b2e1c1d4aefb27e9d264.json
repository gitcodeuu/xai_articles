  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 1 (APP): Pakistan on Friday summoned a senior Indian diplomat to foreign ministry for registering strong protest over ceasefire violations by the Indian occupation forces along the Line of Control (LoC) on December 30, 2020.\nDue to indiscriminate and unprovoked firing by the Indian occupation forces in Kotkotera Sector of the LoC, a 34-year old Muhammad Sarfaraz, son of Mishri Khan, at Phalni Bazar, sustained serious injuries.\nAccording to Foreign Office spokesperson, the Indian occupation forces along the LoC and the Working Boundary (WB) had been continuously targeting civilian populated areas with artillery fire, heavy-caliber mortars, and automatic weapons.\nIn 2020, the Indian occupation forces have carried out 3097 ceasefire violations, resulting into martyrdom of 28 people and serious injuries to 257 innocent civilians, he added.\nCondemning the deplorable targeting of innocent civilians by the Indian occupation forces, it was underscored that such senseless acts are in clear violation of the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding, and are also against all established humanitarian norms and professional military conduct. These egregious violations of international law reflect consistent Indian attempts to escalate the situation along the LoC and are a threat to regional peace and security.\nIt was added that by raising tensions along the LoC and the WB, India cannot divert attention from the grave human rights situation in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK).\nThe Indian side was called upon to respect the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding, investigate this and other such incidents of deliberate ceasefire violations and maintain peace along the LoC and the WB.\nThe Indian side was also urged to allow the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to play its mandated role as per the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions.",
