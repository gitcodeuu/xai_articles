Rehri Goth is among the most dilapidated and ignored areas of Karachi where vast majority of people are living beneath the poverty line and hence this free camp was no less than a blessing for them.\nA mother of an ailing child said her son was ill for past many days but she could not visit any physician because she had no money to bear the expenses.\nAnother woman said she was not only examined by experts but also provided medicines absolutely free of cost.\nThe Free Medical Camp held with due provision for all necessary COVID induced SOPS was also visited by former MPA, Mehtab Akber Rashdi.\nShe on the occasion highlighting importance of free medical camps in the under privileged areas said presence of hundreds of women in the camp showed the dismal affairs of the health system in coastal villages.\nMs. Rashdi urged the area elders to look after the health of women and children as they are the most neglected segments of the community .",
