  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 26 (APP): Kashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control and the world over are observing India’s Republic Day as Black Day on Tuesday to send a loud and clear message to the world and India that the Kashmiris reject Indian illegal occupation and struggling to secure their right to self-determination.\nThe call for the observance of the Black Day was given by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Mirwaiz-led Hurriyat forum and other Hurriyat leaders and organizations, Kashmir Media Service reported.\nThe day is being marked by a complete strike and shutdown in occupied Kashmir and anti-India demonstrations and rallies in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan and world capitals. All shops and business establishments are closed while traffic is off the road.\nThe practice of observing January 26 as Black Day by Kashmiris keeps reminding the world that India is a usurper and the sufferings and miseries of the Kashmiri people will only end when the last Indian soldier leaves Kashmir.\nThe day will remain a dark day in the history of Kashmir as India had been trampling every right of Kashmiris since illegally and forcibly occupying IIOJK in 1947.",
