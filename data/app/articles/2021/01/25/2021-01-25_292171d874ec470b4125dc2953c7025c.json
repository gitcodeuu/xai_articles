  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 25 (APP): Federal Minister for Science and Technology Chaudhry Fawad Hussain Monday said no one will resign at the request of Maryam Nawaz as she could not even get resignation from Captain Safdar’s brother so far.\n“Opposition will continue to work on the same salary and the time of opposition resignations will never come”, he said while talking to the media after witnessing the contract signing ceremony of the High Speed Broadband Project in Jhelum and Chakwal.\nHe said the announcement of date for resignations by the opposition after every three months has now become a joke.\nThe minister said the Pakistan Democratic Movement itself was going through a difficult time and now people have no interest in their public meetings. Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif are a story of the past, today is the era of new politics, he added.\nHe said the minister for Information Technology has been asked to give a tablet to opposition leaders to address on social media.\nResponding to a question on how Maulana Fazl ur Rahman will run the tablet, the minister said he can hire a person for assistance.\n“Their time is up, these are the people of old times, politics has moved forward, these people are far behind”, he said.\nAbout the broadband project, the minister termed the high speed broadband project as a very important initiative and said an amount of Rs250 million has been spent on this project.
