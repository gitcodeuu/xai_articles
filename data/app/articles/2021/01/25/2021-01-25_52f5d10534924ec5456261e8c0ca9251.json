All the components of project would be unveiled at its launching ceremony, he added.\nGiving details of the project, he said international experts were hired to prepare the project, which was finalized after holding thorough consultation with all stakeholders.\nHe said the Brand Pakistan had an exclusive tourism portal, which was meant to promote the country’s tourist attractions across the world through virtual galleries, videos and documentaries.\nIt would provide world-class exposure to Pakistan’s tourist attractions through one click. It consisted of a user-friendly interface to interact with the prospective tourists and give them the necessary and latest information about the country’s tourist attractions, he added.\nHe said a ten-year road-map to invigorate tourism industry was also part of the project. The ‘National Tourism Strategy’ (NTS) 2020-2030 would ensure maximum utilization of its huge resources for sustained economic growth, poverty alleviation and reduced social inequalities.\nHe said the strategy was guided by a vision (2020-2030) that envisaged, a mature, sustainable and responsible tourism industry contributing significantly to the economic development of Pakistan and the quality of life of all her people, primarily through job creation, social inclusion and economic growth.The NTS would raise the industry’s competitiveness and ensure maximum utilization of Pakistan’s natural, cultural, historical and geographical assets, he added.\nThe officer salient features of the strategy included sustained economic growth, employment creation, pov­erty reduction, safety and security of tourists, roads and efficient transport services, comfortable and hygienic accommodation and restaurants, value shopping, efficient telecommunication services and access to quality health services.\nAs a part of National Tourism strategy, he said a five-year National Tourism Strategy Action Plan (2020-2025) had also been prepared that would provide a road-map for effective implementation of the strategic efforts to boost tourism.\nTo a query, he said the project might have launched earlier, but delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nCommenting on the development, Qamar Abbas, an expert with 30 years in hospitality sector, said it was a good initiative as Pakistan’s success depended upon swiftly embracing digitalization and leveraging new technologies to adapt to the “new normal”, a complete shift from conventional to innovative business model.\n“The pandemic gives an opportunity to press the reset button and challenge pre-established models, accelerate the transformation and shift to the “tourism of tomorrow”,” Qamar, who is also a member of National Tourism Coordination Board, remarked.",
