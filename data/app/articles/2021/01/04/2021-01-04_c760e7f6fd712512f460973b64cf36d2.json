They would particularly highlight the reality with the earnest demand about early grant of the birth right of self determination to Kashmiris without further delay and which was being denied by India since over last 72 years because of her traditional hostile and stubborn attitude.\nThe right of self determination day reiterates the long cherished demand of the Kashmiris that they should be granted their birth right to decide about their destiny under the spirit of the internationally-acknowledged U.N resolutions.\n“It would be once again declared by the Kashmiris before the world, through the special day long special meetings at both sides of the line of control and rest of the world that the Kashmir problem should be resolved only in accordance with the United Nations resolutions\n– and no solution of the lingering global dispute sans the aspirations of the Kashmiris would be acceptable to them (Jammu Kashmir people)”, said visiting Chairman of UK-based Global Pakistan Kashmir Council (GPKSC) Raja Sikader Khan one of the major organizers engaged in hosting a special ceremony on January 5 to observe the day in Mirpur in a befitting manner.\nTalking to APP here, Khan said that participants of the scheduled ceremony to be hosted under the auspices of his organization, will reiterate Kashmiris longstanding demand for the early settlement of Kashmir issue according to their wishes. He said that that since Kashmiris were the basic and actual party to the Kashmir problem, this reality could not be ignored.\nIn Mirpur, another Right of self determination day ceremony will be held under the auspices of AJK chapter of Jammu Kashmir Commission for Human Rights at a local hotel Tuesday morning, said Malik Aslam, Chairman AJK chapter of the JKCHR.\nHe said that the ceremony titled “UN Resolutions and International Law: The Legitimate Foundation of Kashmir Dispute – A Way Forward”, will be attended and addressed by the intellect class including eminent icons representing various classes of the local civil society,\nhighlighting the significance of early implementation of the UN resolutions on Kashmir to ensure grant of early right of self determination to the people of Jammu and Kashmir under the spirit of the international norms and commitments, he added.\nSpeakers will highlight the exceptional significance of the day in the backdrop of the Jammu & Kashmir freedom struggle, Malik Aslam said.",
