He also said they were tasked to find out whether protesters were carrying arms.\n“For January 26, the plan was that our other team members would mingle with the protesters. And if the protesters approach with their parade, then we were asked to fire shots at them,” the man said.\nHe said, “During the protests on January 26, the farmers will first be given a warning by the police and if they do not stop, then the plan is to shoot them in their knee first. Then our team of 10 will shoot from behind to make it look like the farmers have resorted to using firearms in Delhi,” he said.\nThe man has been handed over to the Haryana Police and has been taken to Kundli Police Station for questioning.\nMeanwhile according to India Today a scuffle breaks out between farmers and Police as the latter try to stop them from marching to Raj Bhavan in Dehradun, in protest against farm laws.\n#WATCH Uttarakhand: A scuffle breaks out between farmers and Police as the latter try to stop them from marching to Raj Bhavan in Dehradun, in protest against #FarmLaws.
