Moreover, he said, the PML-N regime ruined lives of cotton growers\ndue to the hatred with south Punjab.\n“By blocking supply of pesticides and crop seeds, this royal gang forced the farmers to starve”, Shibli remarked.\nHe said the Jati Umrah road had been frequently carpeted and the roads of south Punjab presented a picture of Mohenjo-daro ruins.\nHe wondered as to how could Maryam Nawaz now cry for South Punjab.\nThe minister said government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf was fulfilling its promises to the people of south Punjab.\nHe said for the first time the Chief Minister of Punjab was elected from a remote area of South Punjab, instead of the Lahore.\nShibli said now a separate secretariat has been set up in south Punjab and development works were being carried out on equal basis there.\nHe said people were now satisfied and this fear was the main worry of the corrupt royal family of PML-N who were ousted by the judiciary and the masses due to their corrupt practices.",
