  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 19 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz Tuesday expressed condolence with the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) leadership on failure of gathering their workers and supporters for protest rally in front of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nThe people were not supporting and participating in the PDM political power shows as it was holding the gatherings to save their corruption and to gain vested interests, he said talking to a private news channel.\nThe minister said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had taken funding from its party workers and other foreign donors through banking verification, authentication and notifies process. The PTI had furnished and submitted all the details of foreign donors in ECP as it had already provided the names of 40,000 donors in the foreign funding case, he added.\nHe said there was no harm to get funds for NIML University and Shaukat Khanam cancer hospital. The decision in foreign funding would be given by the ECP but not PDM leadership, he added.\nShibli Faraz said it was responsibility of the opposition parties including Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) to disclose the names of expatriates who had remitted funds to them.\nBoth the political parties had obtained foreign funds from corruption mafia and also rewarded them during their regimes, he said, adding that they (Political Parties) had utilized the amount for money laundering as well.\nReplying to a question, he said the PML-N bigwigs had got the national reconciliation ordinance (NRO) from dictator and badly damaged the country’s integrity.",
