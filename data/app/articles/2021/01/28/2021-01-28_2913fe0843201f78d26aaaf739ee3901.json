  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 28 (APP): Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Senator Faisal Javed Thursday said that PTI-led government will table a bill in the parliament to amend the constitution for holding senate elections through open balloting as no transparency would be ensured unless secret balloting system abolished.\nTalking to a private news channel, he stressed that instead of making hue and cry over the issue of open balloting parliamentary parties need to come together to put an end to secret balloting by bringing a constitutional amendment.\nIt was top most priority of the Imran Khan’s government to hold the senate elections in peaceful and transparent manner, he added.\nFaisal said that people opposing the proposed move are forgetting that their own party had demanded open ballot in past but now for their own interests they are opposing the bill.\nHe said corrupt leadership in opposition only wanted NRO by changing and interpreting the law in their own favour.\nFaisal Javed said PM Imran Khan was the only honest leader who had cared for common people and taking Pakistan out of difficulties with determination.\nHe said that no doubt there were problems of inflation but eventually, the government would overcome the challenges soon.\n“Indicators of the economy were positive and economic activity was being revived,” he said.\nHe assured that prices of food items would come down as PM was committed for a welfare state and provide corruption free environment to citizens.",
