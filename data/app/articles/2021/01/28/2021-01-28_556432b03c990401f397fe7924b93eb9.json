  "content": "WAHGA BORDER (Lahore) Jan 28 (APP): Another group of Pakistani Hindu families that had migrated to India, to seek better living conditions and economic future, returned here Thursday, fully disappointed, but happy to return home.\nOver 100 Hindus have returned to Pakistan in the past few months, who were lured to migrate to India, with promises of starting a new life and economic prosperity.\n“I would never ever advise anyone to make the same mistake of migrating to India, and we are lucky to be back alive”\nHowever, after a real-life experience of what they said was the “horrific living conditions”, the Hindu families opted to return home.\n“We were far better placed here in Pakistan and had much greater financial status,” said Jesu Mal son of Radho Kachhi who was utterly dismayed by the treatment meted out to them.\nRead Also: Hindu families happy to return home from India\n“Neither we got any place to live, nor any employment,” he said and added, “when we lived in India, we realized, how much better our life was back in Pakistan.”\nHe said the entire family decided to return. However, since the borders were closed owing to the Covid-19 restrictions, they had to stay much longer there.\nThe returning Hindu families would be in Quarantine for fourteen days, before being allowed to return to their native hometowns.\nAnother of the returning Hindus Rano son of Ramji, said “we left Pakistan with dreams of a better future, but what we witnessed was nothing but horrific.”\nHe said eleven of our community members were brutally murdered and the Indian authorities just dumped them. He said no one bothered to check with them what were their requirements and no one told them anything about any of the promised employment opportunities.\n“India only belongs to Brahmans. They treat the rest like dirt,” Rano said.\nTo a question, he said still some Hindu families were in India, but after witnessing the despicable living conditions, the murder of 11 Pakistani Hindus, and attitude of locals, “I would request all to return home and live with dignity and honour.”\n“I would never ever advise anyone to make the same mistake of migrating to India, and we are lucky to be back alive,” Rano Ramji said.\nMembers of the Pakistani Hindu community warmly welcomed the returning community members and presented them rose garlands, as they walked back into Pakistan, with high hopes for a better and secure future.\n– Report by Shafek Koreshe",
