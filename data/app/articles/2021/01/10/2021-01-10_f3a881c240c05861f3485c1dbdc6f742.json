It tripped within a second, causing a cascading effect and all power houses tripped, one after the other, he said.\nHe said the fault caused the country’s high transmission lines to trip, which in turn caused the system frequency to drop from 50 Hertz to 0 Hertz in less than a second.\nSoon after developing the fault, the safety system started work to shutting down the power plants which resulted 10,300 MW out of the system, he said.\nHe said from North to South, Tarbela and Mangla power stations witnessed shut down.
