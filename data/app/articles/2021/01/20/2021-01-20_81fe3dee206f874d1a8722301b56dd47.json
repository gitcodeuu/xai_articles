Our relationship has been and must be larger in the sum total of our shared interests with respect to Afghaistan and counter-terrorism,” he said.\nOn India, he mentioned that the country had changed for worse with illegal action of August 5, persecution of Kashmiris and religious minorities and its strained relations with all neighbours owing to Hindutva approach.\nHe said Pakistan had already shared a detailed dossier with the U.S. on India’s efforts to promote terrorism and instability in Pakistan and hoped that the Biden administration would facilitate substantive engagement between Pakistan and India to help resolve outstanding disputes.\nHe said the U.S must be mindful of India’s designs to distract the international community from its nefarious designs as its leaders openly spoke about using military force against Pakistan in a nuclearized environment.\nQureshi said Pakistan was a nation of 220 million with two-third of its population under 30 years of age and sitting at crossroads of China, and South and Central Asia.\nHe said since Pakistan envisioned itself as a future hub for trade and investment in the region, the U.S administration could maintain geo-economic relations with Pakistan.\nFor incoming Biden admin, he stressed cooperation in energy, public health and climate change.\nHe called for enhanced educational exchanges between two countries.\nHe mentioned that Pakistani-Amrerican community was playing an important bridge and core factor in bringing closer the two nations.\nOn the strategy of Foreign Office in taking diplomatic offensive, he said the focus had shifted towards geo-economics that demanded peace in the region.\nAbout balancing powers between U.S. and China, he said Pakistan understands the importance of U.S. which is a global economic, military and technology partner, while China stood with Pakistan in odds.\n“We want a very balanced and a healthy relationship with two powers and don’t want to be seen as wither in one or another camp. Pakistan is willing to engage with everyone,” he said.\nHe said, “Pakistan and U.S. have convergences in many areas and also differences, which can be ironed out with better understanding,” he said.\nChairman Karachi Council on Foreign Relations Ikram Sehgal, former ambassador Robin Raphel, and intellectuals Dr Huma Baqai, Kaleem Farooqui and Javed Ashraf participated in the webinar.",
