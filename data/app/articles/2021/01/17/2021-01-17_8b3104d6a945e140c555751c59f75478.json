It is a great honor for any climber to scale the world’s second highest peak, said Gandapur.\nHe said dozens of climbers visited Pakistan every year for mountaineering as it offers a number of mountains to the adventure tourists.\nPakistan has tremendous potential for winter tourism and the government will provide all possible facilities to the climbers, he added.\nGandapur said Gilgit-Baltistan government was taking practical measures to promote winter tourism at the region that will eventually create more employment opportunities for the people at the area.\nThe minister also appreciated Pakistan Army and other security agencies for rescuing the mountaineers from dangerous weather conditions at the region.\nHe also expressed deep sorrow over the death of Spanish climber Sergio Mingote Moreno, who lost his life on Saturday while returning to base camp when he fell into the crevasse.",
