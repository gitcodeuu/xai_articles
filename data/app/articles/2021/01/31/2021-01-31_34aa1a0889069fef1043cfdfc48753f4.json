It had thermogun and sanitizer facilities as well.\nHe said the initiative was part of the ‘Promoting Health Lifestyle’ campaign, launched at the shelter homes in the wake of first wave of coronavirus pandemic.\nThe drive was meant to transform the shelter homes in neat and clean facilities, where the daily wage earners could enjoy healthy lifestyle apart from food and shelter.\n“We are driven by the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who is determined to provide free healthcare facility to every citizen of Pakistan,” he remarked while mentioning free health cards initiative of the present government.",
