I wish once again to congratulate the exporters and the Ministry of Commerce for this achievement. pic.twitter.com/lpmZa6MOl5\n— Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) January 7, 2021\nThe prime minister said as per the regional export trends, the exports of India and Bangladesh for November and December 2020 showed negative growth, unlike Pakistan.\n“I wish once again to congratulate the exporters and the Ministry of Commerce for this achievement,” the prime minister said on Twitter.",
