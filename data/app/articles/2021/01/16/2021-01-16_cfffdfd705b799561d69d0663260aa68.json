I’m humbled to say that as a team, we have summited the magnificent K2 in extreme winter conditions,” said Nirmal Purja, who last year broke the world record for climbing the 14 tallest peaks in the shortest time.\nFour teams with around 48 mountaineers – 43 male and five female have kicked off the winter ascend of K2 on December 19, 2020.
