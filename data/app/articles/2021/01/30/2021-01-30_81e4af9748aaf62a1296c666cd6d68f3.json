The government has taken indiscriminate action against the qabza mafia in Changa Manga, he added.\nNew saplings have been planted in Changa Manga, as tree plantation was a national, social and religious obligation. He termed the 150-year-old artificial forest of Changa Manga a botanical heritage. The Changa Manga was not merely a reserve of trees but also a source of flourishing wildlife. He stressed that citizens should actively participate in the tree-plantation campaign. Earlier, the chief minister planted a sapling at Changa Manga.",
