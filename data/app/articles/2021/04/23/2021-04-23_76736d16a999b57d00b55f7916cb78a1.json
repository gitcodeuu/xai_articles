New building by-laws were also being implemented and a ban on new constructions has been lifted, he stated.\nThe CM affirmed the emergency of THQ hospital Kahuta will be upgraded along with the up-gradation of Samli Sanatorium.

Meanwhile, he said projects like tourist highways and provision and drainage of water will also be started to resolve such issues.\nThe CM added the government was giving attention to the provision of facilities in Murree’s peripheral areas to develop them as tourist spots. Under this policy, a new tourist-spot new Dhar java water supply project will be developed along with a link road from Dhanoi to Narrar (Punj Peer Mountains) to improve the movement of traffic.\nSimilarly, separate tourist highways will also be constructed including Lower Topa Murree and Bostanabad Road, he added.
