He said when his party came to power in 2018, it was the most difficult phase of his life.\nIn the history of Pakistan, no one ever inherited such as government when the country was at the brink of bankruptcy with record deficit, he added.\nThe prime minister said the country’s debt soared by four per cent during previous governments, the foreign reserves had depleted and the current account deficit was hovering around 20 billion dollars.\nHe expressed his gratitude to Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and China for providing succour in those trying times. The country survived with much difficulty, he added.\nIf it did not happen, the rupee would have continued tumbling against dollar and where this depreciation had stopped nobody knew, he maintained.\nThe prime minister said he felt pride over the two and half years of his government’s performance.\n“Now the current account is in surplus and the country’s reserves are increasing with rupee getting strength. People are getting confidence due to the economic growth,” he added.\nThe prime minister further mentioned that the construction sector was moving at fast pace, cement sale was soaring, and the large-scale manufacturing and vehicles sale were on the rise.\nFamers had been happy for the first time with the government’s policies and getting right prices for their yields including wheat and sugarcane.\nThe prime minister further said that the government was focusing on wealth creation in the country with the construction of two ambitious projects like Ravi River Urban Front City Lahore and Bundal Islands in Karachi.\nThrough private-public partnership billions of rupees investment would be made in these two mega projects, he said, adding the government was giving incentives to the small and large industry.\nThe prime minister informed that on Monday, he was going to launch Kissan cards.\nThe tourism sector of the country possessed huge potential, besides, 10 Billion Tree Tsunami would bring revolution. Two new big dams were being constructed in the country after a gap of fifty years, he enumerated some of the big achievements of his government.\nThe prime minister further said that in Riasat-e-Madina, our Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) had stressed upon building of moral character and rule of law.\nFor the first time in the world’s history, a welfare state took responsibility of the weaker segments of society, he added.\nThe prime minister said his government had introduced health insurance in two provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab. This initiative would encourage private sectors to compete in the health sector and even establish their infrastructures in the poor areas.\nAbout other welfare initiatives of his government, the prime minister said they set up Panahgah (shelter homes) for labourers. While under ‘no one go hungry’ project, meal trucks would reach to the poor areas.\nThe government had introduced affordable housing for the low-income group or those segments of society who never dreamt of having their own home. They had changed the mortgage law due to which in the past, the banks were reluctant to offer loans for construction of houses.\nAbout main objective behind formation of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf, the prime minister said it was the corruption of the ruling elite which had been undermining the country.\nFor the first time, a political party struggled against corruption, he said, adding “A nation did not ruin due to lack of resources, but due to teeming corruption, and that of the ruling elite that burdens the nation with foreign debt.”\nThe prime minister said it was a story of the developing countries. In the developed and prosperous nations, there was rule of law whereas in the poor countries the situation was different one due to corruption, he added.\nAgainst this backdrop, the PTI was formed whose moto was to bring the responsible accountable for their corrupt practices so that justice should prevail in the society.\nHe said those politicians were looked down upon in a society who accumulated wealth through illegal means and corruption. There were still those who took it as their moral onus to serve the nation.\nHe said that Allah Almighty had bestowed upon him everything due to his prolific cricket career.\nThe prime minister said during the first 15 years of PTI’s formation, the party did not win a seat which made many to leave the party and during the year 2002, few people were left in the party.\nHe said that he never accepted the defeat as he had learnt from his cricket career that was ‘never go down’. So, he succeeded in cricket and also in the construction of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital.\n“If a person dreams, then he must burn all his boats to succeed,” he maintained.\nIn the next phase, young generation joined the party and on 30th Oct, 2011 people came out for his party during a gathering at Minar e Pakistan. During, 2013 they formed government in KP, despite huge rigging.\nAt that time, they demanded opening of few constituencies, but no action was taken on election reforms, he said and expressed his optimism that they were now introducing electronic voting technology system for fair and transparent elections.\nThe prime minister also referred to the life history of the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), as he faced hard times during the first thirteen years of his prophethood, but in the next ten years, he brought a revolution in the world and changed the world’s history.",
