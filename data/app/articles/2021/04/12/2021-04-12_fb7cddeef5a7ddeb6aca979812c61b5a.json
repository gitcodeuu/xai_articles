With the exception of a few countries, the governments of all the influential countries did not speak out against India because of their strategic, political and economic interests while four of the five members of the UN Security Council, except China were trading with India.\nWhen asked what compelled India to negotiate with Pakistan, the Azad Kashmir president said that the BJP government in India was under intense internal pressure because the Modi government had tried to implement the Kashmir like policies in other states of India and had to face stiff resistance from the Indian people.\nThe second reason was that India’s arrogant expansionist policies were shattered by China in the Ladakh Valley which forced it to reconsider its policy to some extent but India’s oppression in Kashmir did not abate.\nReplying to a question about the rumours of making Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan provinces of Pakistan, President Sardar Masood Khan said that it was important to understand the difference between Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. The people of GB demanding their constitutional rights under provisional province, but there was no such demand in AJK.\nThe Government in Azad Kashmir, he emphasized, was governed by the Declaration of October 24, 1947 under which the State of Azad Kashmir was the base camp of the Freedom Movement of Kashmir, whose primary responsibility was to play its role in liberating the occupied part of the state of Jammu and Kashmir from Indian subjugation.\nReplying to a question about holding a plebiscite after resettling Indian citizens in occupied Kashmir and changing the demography of the occupied state, AJK President Sardar Masood Khan said”India is not ready to hold a referendum in IOJK to decide the political future of Kashmiris.”\nHe said”India considers Kashmir as its “integral part” and is not ready for a referendum. If plebiscite ever held in Kashmir, it will be participated only by the Kashmiris who themselves or their ancestors were citizens of Kashmir even before 1947.”\nHe further said those who were being settled in Kashmir illegally by India right now would have no right to participate in the referendum",
