About 4,820 kanals of land was acquired through land acquisition collection under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in March, 2004, they added.\nThey said the consent award for sub-sectors G-14/1, 2 and 3 was announced in 2005 at the rate of Rs590,000 per kanal for total land 4,820 kanals and the infrastructure development work was taken up by the authority.\nThe sources said the development of sub-sector G-14/4 had been completed, while 80 percent rehabilitation work had been completed and infrastructure development work of sub-sectors G-14/2, 3 was in progress.\nThey said overall 60 percent infrastructure development was completed and the remaining work would be completed once the issue of built up properties (BUPs) was resolved for which the FGEHA was striving hard.\nThe consultant was hired for sub-sector G-14/1 where the topographic survey had been completed. The award of BUPs in sub-sectors G-14/1, 2 was yet to be made for which survey of the BUPs was underway.\nAround Rs1.889 billion had been awarded as compensation for 529 BUPs in sub-sector G-14/3 by the LAC Office, they said.\nThey said due to resistance shown by locals of sub-sector G-14/1, the assessment of the BUPs had been completed through geographic information system technology.",
