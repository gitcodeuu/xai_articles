It is more than 5% in 51 cities across the country,” he underscored.\nExcept Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT), he said, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Peshawar, Mardan, Nowshera, Charsadda and Swabi were among the major cities with higher positivity ratio.\nSimilarly in Punjab, Rawalpindi, Lahore, Faisalabad, Multan, Bahawalpur, Gujranwala, Karachi and Hyderabad in Sindh, Quetta in Balochistan and Muzaffarabad in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) in particular had been severely affected by the pandemic as the positivity ratio was increasing in those areas, he added.\nThe enhanced deployment of Pakistan Army had been done in the above mentioned 16 cities, he added.\nApril 23, he said, was the deadliest day ever as death toll was the highest where 157 people lost their lives due to the coronavirus.\nAt present some 4,300 COVID patients were in critical condition while 570 were on ventilators across the country, he added. Over 90 percent ventilators were occupied in some cities of the country, he said.\nThe DG ISPR said,”The average death rate from the coronavirus in April was the highest.”\nSince February 26, 2020, he said,17,187 people had died due to the pandemic. “At present, the global case fatality rate (CFR) due to the coronavirus is 2.12 per cent, while during this pandemic wave, the CFR in Pakistan has increased to 2.16 per cent for the first time as compared to the world.”\nHe mentioned that an important meeting of the National Coordination Committee (NCC) was held on April 23 under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Imran Khan in which Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa was also present.\nWith the consultation and mutual consent of all the stakeholders, he said, the NCC had taken some important and timely decisions regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs or alternate measures to treat the disease other than medical treatment) to control the third wave of coronavirus pandemic.\nThe army troops, he said, had reached at district level across the country since 6 am Monday to assist the civil administration.\nUnder Article 245, a team each, headed by officers of Brigadier rank, had been deployed at the level of Administrative Divisions across the country, the DG ISPR explained.\n“At each district level, the army troops, led by Lieutenant Colonel, will assist the civil administration. The main purpose of deploying Pakistan Army troops is to support the civilian government and law enforcement agencies (LEAs),” he said.\nAs regards the enforcement mechanism, he said the meeting of all the Provincial Apex Committees would be held once in a week in which the overall situation would be reviewed, especially the high positivity ratio areas.\nThe implementation of precautionary measures was an effective response to the pandemic stemming its outrageous spread, he added.\n“We must all work together individually and collectively to ensure the health and safety of the people,” the DG ISPR urged the nation.\n“We can be safe from this contagion only by following the safety guidelines regarding the use of face mask and social distancing,” he said.\nThe blessed month of Ramazan, he said, “teaches us compassion and discipline. We can remedy each other’s problems by ensuring safety measures in homes, mosques and all other places.”\nThe DG ISPR said the cooperation and sense of responsibility of the people since the beginning of the pandemic had protected the nation from its most dangerous harms as compared to other countries and still as a nation “we have to show more caution and responsibility than ever before”.\nHe urged the masses to show compassion towards the people around them during the month of Ramazan.\nHe concluded the talk praying to The Almighty to protect everyone from the pandemic.”May Allah Almighty grant success to all those who are engaged in saving the lives of others without caring for their own lives. Ameen.”",
