However, the matter was still pending in trial court, he added.\nTo a question by the bench, the prosecutor replied that the ANF had frozen all assets of the accused.\nThe bench asked whether the NAB case was about the same properties.\nThe prosecutor stated that the ANF had its own case and the bureau had its own.\nThe bench noted that the properties were same in both cases, and the ANF had frozen them and it would remain frozen till a decision in the case.\nThe prosecutor stated that the ANF freezed assets temporarily. However, the court questioned whether the said property would be confiscated if the trial court convicted Rana Sanaullah.
