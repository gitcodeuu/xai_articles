He said that the most senior citizens who have registered for vaccination receive SMS with instructions on their mobile phones and the oldest persons will be vaccinated first.\nThe senior-most citizens will be the first ones to receive the doses of the COVID-19 vaccine. He urged the healthcare workers and those eligible to get vaccinated to protect themselves as well as their loved ones.\nThe vaccinations will be done in reverse order by age which means the oldest person who has registered will be vaccinated first, he added.\nDr. Faisal said that the health department had started registration of those 60 years and above for the immunization program from February 15, asking the citizens to send a text message at 1166 or enter their details at the national immunization management system (NIMS) website.\nOnce registered, the eligible citizens will be informed about the vaccine center and the date of vaccination through a text message, he added.\nHe said the government has completed training of vaccinators and other related staff while software has been developed for having daily figures of vaccination activities.\nHe said that this time is not of any complacency rather strict compliance of SOPs. “COVID-19 is a deadly virus but we can control it just as we controlled it by following the SoPs during the previous waves.”\nDr. Faisal said that the government is seeking full cooperation of the citizens in adhering to the SoPs. “We can save precious lives including those of our near and dear ones by taking preventive measures.” He asked the citizens to wear a mask, maintain social distance, wash hands with soap frequently and avoid crowded places.",
