  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 20 (APP): Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Noor ul Haq on Tuesday reiterated that no Muslim could compromise on the respect of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) as he was dearer to them than their lives.\n“The holy Prophet (PBUH) is dearer to us all than our own souls. His respect is the part of our faith. We can have different ways and procedures, but our destination is the same that nothing can take precedence ahead of the Prophet in our feelings,” he said speaking in the National Assembly.\nThe minister said Pakistan came into being in the name of Islam and the resolution tabled in the House was a positive action to uphold the sanctity of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).\nHe said Prime Minister Imran Khan had effectively highlighted across the world that the respect and honour of the Holy Prophet was dear to all the Muslims. He raised the issue of blasphemy to the Holy Prophet at all the international forums, including the United Nations and Organisation Islamic Cooperation.\nIt needed more work and “we all should join hands for this noble cause,” he stressed.\nEarlier speaking in House, former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said the entire country was unanimous on the issue of Tahaffuz-i-Namoos-i-Risalat (protection of the sanctity of Prophethood).\nA unanimous resolution should have been tabled in the House and the government should have taken the opposition on board regarding the session, he added.\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leader reiterated that there was no difference of opinion on Tahaffuz-i-Namoos-i-Risalat and Khatm-i-Nabuwwat (Finality of the Prophithood). He said the opposition should be be given some time to study the draft and suggest any additions so that the resolution could be passed unanimously today and a debate could be started.\nHe also opposed the constitution of a special committee for the purpose.\nMinister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan responded to the speech of Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and said the government desired a debate on the issue.\nHe said the resolution based on the exact discussions held between the the government and the TLP was moved by a private member and therefore the government did not plan to make changes to it.\nHowever, any amendments suggested by the entire House would be incorporated, he added.\nPML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal said the resolution was presented by a private member in the House. It should have been tabled by either the Interior Minister or Minister for Religious Affairs in order to make it an official business.\nHe demanded the government to present the agreement inked with the banned outfit.\nHe said the resolution should be brought in the House with the consultation of the opposition and urged the speaker to adjourn the session for the purpose.\nMinister for Planning and Reforms Asad Umar said that being Pakistanis, they were proud that Pakistan and Prime Minister Imran Khan had raised vociferously voice for the sanctity of Holy Prophet (PBUH) at all international fora. “It should be the aim of our life that no one could dare to do blasphemy of our holy Prophet,” he said.\nHe said the government was ready to join hands with the opposition to devise a comprehensive strategy in that regard.",
