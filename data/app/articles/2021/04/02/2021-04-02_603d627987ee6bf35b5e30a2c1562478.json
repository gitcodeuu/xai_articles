To ensure transparency and integrity in data collection, the entire survey process has been made end-to-end digital.\nThe field teams are going door to door to collect the data of households at the doorstep through an android based application.\nA new survey model has been developed to conduct the survey in AJK, Gilgit Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including newly merged districts (erstwhile FATA) and several other areas of the country.\nThe new model is centered on the fast-track approach to implement the survey in collaboration with provincial school education departments under the technical supervision of Ehsaas.\n“Owing to the technical nature of computerized Ehsaas survey, massive training of master trainers, trainers, enumerators, and supervisors is an important element of the Ehsaas survey methodology. This is also critical to ensure survey quality”, stated Dr. Sania Nishtar in a press statement.\n“Ehsaas survey is free of cost and enumerators are not authorized to charge any fee for carrying out survey of households. This is entirely an apolitical survey being carried on a paperless approach.\nTo get registered in Ehsaas, households should cooperate with the survey teams and share correct data when the survey teams visit them”, she said.\nAccording to Ehsaas strategy, as the door-to-door survey reaches a 70 percent completion in a Tehsil, a registration desk is opened enabling missing households desirous of benefitting from Ehsaas to register themselves. To-date, desks have been opened in every Tehsil of 60 Districts in total.\nThese desks are facilitating those households to register themselves that were missed during the survey.",
