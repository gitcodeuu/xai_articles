The government is giving subsidy of Rs300,000 against each residential unit on first 100,000 houses, he told.\nDuring a presentation, the prime minister was told by the Punjab chief secretary about the two times rapid horizontal growth of Lahore city during last 20 years, he said adding it was all due to ill planing and ruthless land grabbing by political land mafia backed by previous regimes.\nShahbaz Gill said Prime Minister Imran Khan himself belongs to Lahore city and he has great concerns about the growing civic issues of the city and lowering of its underground water table. The government has first time seriously started working on the project and Prime Minister Imran Khan was always accepting the challenges to take it to its logical end, he added.\nTo a question, he said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf has always respected any kind of decision by the court and the recent verdict of the Supreme Court must be accepted with same spirit as its earlier decision against Maryam Nawaz.\nTo another question, the SAPM said the accused in sugar scam are brought before the people first time during his government, besides fixing its standard market rate. He said a new law to monitor supply chain of sugar has introduced in Punjab.\nAbout the economic growth rate, he said the inland car manufacturing in March has broken all the records of last 30 years. By the grace of Allah Almighty, Pakistani rupee is best performing currency against the dollar, he told.",
