The olive revolution initiated by the incumbent government would change the lives of the people.\nMoreover, the government was also focusing on the cultivation of avocado and saffron to enhance the country’s exports, and improve the nutrition of the people, he added.\nIn wake of the complaints, the prime minister again emphasized the banks’ managements to train their staffers to facilitate and expedite the process of housing or business loans under the government’s schemes as they were not in the habit of dealing with such process.\nHe said the pollution was another major issue faced by the cities due to their unplanned growth.\nDue to the very reasons, the government had planned Ravi City in Lahore and Bundal Island Project in Sindh to promote the vertical buildings.\nHe said the haphazard growth of cities also made it difficult for the civic agencies to provide utility services to the residents. Besides, the ill-planned growth of cities was also eating up the cultivable land, he added.\nThe prime minister said the Federal Government would try to convince the Sindh Government, that had withdrawn the non-objection certificate (NoC) issued to the former for the development of Bundal Island project which also consisted of plants to treat sea water.\nSimilarly, the Ravi City project also featured the plantation of around 70,000 trees, besides the development of 50 Miyawaki forest sites being developed by the government.\nHe said the previous government’s inability to execute any housing project for the poor led to the mushroom growth of the slums over 40 percent of the Karachi city.\nHowever, the incumbent government would come up with a plan to provide better housing facilities for the slum dwellers.\nEarlier, the prime minister, accompanied by the federal ministers and heads of the banks witnessed the signing of MoU.\nMaritime Affairs Minister Ali Haider Zaidi said the exports of the country’s fisheries industry stood at around $450 million contrary to Vietnam’s around $8.5 billion.\nHe, however, expressed the hope that consequent to the government’s ongoing initiatives, the seafood exports would touch $2.5 billion mark within one and a half years.\nThe minister said the fisheries sector engaged around 1% of the labour for it being the third biggest one after oil and gas.\nHe said besides catching many big fish involved in corruption, his ministry had ended the corruption involving the sale of deep sea fishing licenses to the parties, which used to take fish abroad illegally without reflecting it in national exports.\nMoreover, the ministry would present to the cabinet the deep sea fishing policy by June for approval, he added.\nZaidi said the Kamyab Jawan Programme loans would enable the fishermen to purchase their own vessels and become an entrepreneur. Moreover, they would also be able to install freezers at their vessel to preserve the fish, which, otherwise, used to rot before reaching the market.\nSAPM Usman Dar said the four of 21 partner banks of Kamyab Jawan Programme had come up to support the fishery sector, which was rich with immense potential.\nHe said the fishermen were never given access to finance by the previous government but the MoU would help end their deprivation.\nHe said with the help of Kamyab Jawan loans, around 10,000 youths had started their small or medium scale businesses providing direct employment to around 70,000 people and indirectly to 250,000.\nHowever, he hoped that the project would help provide business loans to 100,000 youths to enable them run their own business and act as entrepreneurs.\nDar said through the programme, the government would also uplift the small medium enterprises (SMEs) sector, which in the past remained deprived of access to finance.",
