  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 06 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan has directed initiation of strict action against land grabbing/Qabza mafia at the federal and provincial levels as per law.\nThe prime minister, on April 4, during a telephonic interaction with public had announced provision of an exclusive category on Pakistan Citizen’s Portal (PCP) for lodging of complaints about land grabbing/qabza mafia.\nAccording to a letter of Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Muhammad Azam Khan, inclusion of the category in PCP would facilitate the public in lodging complaints regarding mafia grabbing their lands, besides enabling them to blow the whistle about the state land encroached upon or grabbed.\nIt will also help the concerned authorities to get abreast of the grey areas of administration pertaining to the issue, get analytics for policy formulation, evaluate performance/efficiency of the officers concerned and hold them accountable in case of negligence/laxity.\nThe prime minister further directed all chief secretaries to hold meetings with the heads of concerned departments, development authorities, commissioners/RPOs, DCs/DPOs and sensitize them about the significance of the issue.\nIn case of private matters, the concerned authorities were directed that allegations leveled should be probed properly after hearing both parties rather than taking action straightaway.\nMoreover, it was directed that the complaints of the overseas Pakistanis should be looked into as priority.",
