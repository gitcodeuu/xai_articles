The officials of the climate change ministry were also in presence at the event.\nLack of financial resources, preparedness, knowledge, capacity and disaster-resilient public infrastructures are among key issues being faced by the GB and KPK governments that hamper their efforts to protect lives and livelihoods of the mountain communities in these areas from the deleterious impacts of GLOF events, which wipe out everything on their way when burst out, the additional secretary Joudat Ayaz pointed out.\nHe hoped that however the joining of hands with GB and KP governments, UNDP would play a vibrant role to addresses the issues.\nSharing further details of the activities to be conducted by relevant GB and KP government departments in support with the climate change ministry and UNDP-Pakistan, the climate change ministry official said that the activities to be carried out under the LoAs would also seek to achieve significant results in the form of studies undertaken for risk assessments, GIS mapping of hazard locations and completion of forestry surveys, he said.\nIn addition, Provincial Climate Change Adaptation Action would not only formulate plans under the agreement but also carry out specific set of interventions for each site selected in the shape of building small scale infrastructure, promotion of water efficient, risk-informed farming technologies, and documentation of indigenous best practices to demonstrate nature-bases solutions, Joudat Ayaz added.\nHe said further that the agreements were of unprecedented importance, which build on the ongoing partnership between the Government of Pakistan and UNDP that had remained instrumental for stage-setting for stronger cooperation to have a common understanding on the GLOF risks in the country’s northern regions and the importance of resilience building of communities against climate induced disasters.\nThe LoAs would also focus greatly on community mobilisation activities for mass sensitisation awareness, disaster risk reduction capacity-building trainings and outreach through media, the ministry official added.\nThe climate change ministry additional secretary Joudat Ayaz, however, hoped that provincial development departments of KP and GB would act as lead partners for the Scaling up of Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOF-II) project and provide support in coordinating activities with respective line departments in each province.\nEarlier, the signatories agreed to ensure that the GLOB-II project being implemented in 18 districts of GB and KP gives all partners a great opportunity to expand their development agenda towards a more secure and risk averted Pakistan to climate change impacts.\nLed by Ministry of Climate Change, with the support from UNDP and funding support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the GLOF project-II targets the most vulnerable rural communities in the high-altitude regions of the country, said Joudat Ayaz, the GLOF-II national project director and added that several scaled-up early warning systems and automated weather stations would be installed in the GLOF-sensitive areas under the project to mitigate the cope with the GLOF events.",
