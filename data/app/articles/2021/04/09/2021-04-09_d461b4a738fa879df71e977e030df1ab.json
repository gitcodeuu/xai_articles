  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 09 (APP):Minister for Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan Affairs Ali Amin Khan Gandapur on Friday urged the international community to prosecute Indian civil and military personnel for “the worst form of state terrorism and serious crimes against humanity” in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nHe made this appeal while condemning fresh Indian acts of state terrorism that martyred four more Kashmiri youth in Pulwama and Shopian districts on Friday during the so-called cordon and search operation, a news release said.\nHe said New Delhi had “intensified” its “state terrorism” after launching a “military siege” on Aug,5, 2019 – the day India had revoked the disputed Himalayan region’s special autonomous status and split it into two federally administered territory .\nGandapur said India’s brutal acts were aimed at demographics apartheid in the IIOJK as it could not suppress the Kashmiris’ freedom struggle with tyranny and barbarism.\nIndo-Pak relations could not be normalized until any concrete progress for resolution of the Kashmir issue was started, he observed.",
