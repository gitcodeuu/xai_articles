It was the Sindh government which had been encouraging hoarders, he observed.\nUnlike the Sindh government, he said the government in Punjab lodged 347 FIRs and arrested 244 persons for hoarding fertilizers. The Punjab government deserved appreciation for preventing exploitation of farmers, he added.\nSuch administrative actions ensured Rs 400 per sack decrease in fertilizer’s price, he said, lashing out the Sindh government for taking anti-farmers measures.He said the Sindh government did not taking any administrative action against the hoarders.\nAll the governments, except the Sindh’s had given their share for providing subsidy to the farmers on Diammonium phosphate (DAP), he added.\nFarrukh Habib said the global inflation had increased due to sluggish business activities due to coronavirus pandemic. The price of petroleum products had increased by 100 percent, he added.\nSimilarly, the price of edible oil had also registered the surge from $400 per ton to $1300 per ton.\nHe blamed 70 percent lentils’ imports as major cause of increase in their prices.The minister said the 20 year record of inflation had broken in Euro Zone due to Covid-19.\nIn Euro Zone five percent increase was registered in inflation, he said, adding in United States of America (USA) 31 years record of inflation had broken with 6.2 percent increase in inflation.\nIn Canada, 4.7 percent inflation has increased. Likewise, 26 and 50 years record of inflation has also broken in China and Germany respectively.\nAccording to a report of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, over 50 years record of global inflation had broken.\nThe government had substantially decreased the ratio of taxes to minimize the effects of inflation, he added.\nHe said the government had collected some Rs 400 billion less taxes by not passing on the prices of petroleum products to masses.",
