He asked the media that it should examine the documents of the cases against Shahbaz Sharif and Hamza Shahbaz Sharif and bring the facts before the people.\nThe minister said that there was only one chance of escape from punishment for Sahbaz if no hearings of the case were held. He hoped that the court would make day to day hearing of the case for its early disposal.\nHe informed the media that Prime Minister Imran Khan appeared as a witness in his defamation case against Khawaja Asif through video link.\nUnder the new system set up by the Law Ministry in Islamabad, he said witnesses can appear in their cases through video conferencing, and this practice has been started .\nHe said that Khawaja Asif alleged misuse of charity money at Shaukat Khanum Hospital in 2012, and the case has not been decided yet.\nShaukat Khanum Hospital spent Rs 70 billion every year on treatment of poor people, Chaudhry Fawad said, adding if such allegations were made then who will do charity work in Pakistan.\nHe expressed the hope this case will be decided soon, and as always Khawaja Asif would prove to be a liar, as he never told the truth in his life.\nThe minister said during Punjab Committee meeting the Prime Minister has expressed no confidence in Khanewal election in the meeting of Punjab Committee.\nHe said that deficiencies should be rectified, reports of money laundering and horse trading came to the fore in bye elections which was unfortunate and ECP should take steps in this regard so that horse trading in elections can be stopped.\nThe minister said that upcoming local body elections in Punjab were discussed in detail and a high level committee had been formed in Punjab to finalize the candidates for the post of district mayor.\nHe said that Minister for Energy Hamad Azhar gave a briefing on the gas issue in a meeting of spokespersons.
