You have to define yourself instead of letting others define you,” he said.\nHe said lack of in-depth research led to reliance on second-hand information by the western think tanks on important issues such as Afghanistan.\nPakistan, he said, was the country that suffered most in collateral damage in the wake of the Afghan conflict, however was made a scapegoat for the mistakes of the superpowers.\nHe mentioned that inability of the national leadership to handle the Afghan situation wisely landed the country into two main pro and anti-America divisions.\nHe said the role of local thinktanks in this situation was important to effectively highlight Pakistan’s perspective in the world rather than being under continuous criticism by the western lobbies.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan was blamed for wrong reasons by the international community, whereas it remained mum on the atrocities committed by India in the Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nImran Khan said Pakistan in fact had a beautiful and positive face being the home of generous and hospitable people.\nOn Islamophobia, he said, a strong response by Muslim thin ktanks was important to nullify the impression of Islam’s linkage with terrorism.",
