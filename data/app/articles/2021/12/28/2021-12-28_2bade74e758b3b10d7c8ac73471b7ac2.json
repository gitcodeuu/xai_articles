Therefore, the Policy aspects of National Cohesion should revolve around the nation’s diversity. All aspects of diversity would be taken along with other elements of NSP,” he elaborated.\nMoreover, human security aspects of NSP had core focus on population followed by health security, climate and water, food security and gender. As far as the economic security was concerned, he said this policy gave made due discussion on it.\nThe main points, he said included external imbalance vis-a-vis export and import issues leading to increased current account deficit, energy security and education was included in economy as education’s one component was related to national security namely unity and radicalization.\nHe added that the second important concern of Pakistan was to produce quality human resource that would have ultimate impact on economy at the local level was also discussed under the chapter of economic security.\nThe other elements of the Policy shed light on sovereignty, territorial integrity meaning hard security related to defence and military security.\nThe NSP formulation process started back in 2014 which got completed in seven years, as there were many sensitivity and complexities into it, whereas massive debate was carried out in the process.\n“I would like to inform that four rounds of all federal ministries and provinces have been made where they gave input over the years.

The positive thing about this NSP is that this policy has the ownership of NSC where civil military leadership sits together and a complete implementation plan is being prepared for implementation,” the NSA said.\nHe underscored that the Prime Minister has directed that National Security Division (NSD) would give monthly update to NSC on implementation of NSP and problems being faced in its implementation.\n“It’s an overall vision and umbrella document to guide various sectors in policy making over the time.

It is a truly historic achievement; a citizen-centric comprehensive National Security policy with economic security at the core will now be pursued in earnest.”\nHe said: “This umbrella document will, overtime, help guide sectoral policies for the fulfillment of our national security objectives.”\nDr Moeed further tweeted: “I would like to thank the civil and military leadership for all their support and input. The Policy would not have seen the light of day without the Prime Minister’s constant leadership and encouragement.\nI am extremely fortunate to have such a dedicated team at our @SPPCPakistan and would like to congratulate them and the entire team of the National Security Division for their hardwork and dedication over the years in bringing the policy to fruition.
