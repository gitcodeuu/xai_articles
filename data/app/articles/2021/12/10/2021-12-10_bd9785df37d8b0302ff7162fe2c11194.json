  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 10 (APP): The European phase of Khalistan Referendum started on Friday in Geneva, Switzerland which the Sikhs leaders hope to be the biggest gathering to remind the United Nations of its commitment to Sikhs facing non-stop persecution by Hindutva-dominated Indian administration.\nThe result of the Khalistan referendum would be declared by the Punjab Referendum Commission after the final phase of voting to be held in the next six months.\nLater, the findings of the Khalistan referendum would be shared with the UN and international bodies to create a wider consensus.\nIn the future, the referendum will also be held in the US, Canada, Australia, and the Indian region of Punjab.\nThe fifth phase of the referendum for an independent Sikh homeland was held in UK on December 5, 2021.\nThe Sikh community massively participated in earlier four phases of Khalistan Referendum. The voting had started in London on October 31, 2021. Over, 30,000 Sikhs took part in the first phase of the referendum.\nThe second phase was held in South-hall & Gravesend in the UK on November 7, 2021, participated by more than 10,000 British Sikhs.\nThird phase of Khalistan referendum was held in Birmingham & Barking in the UK on November 14, 2021, while fourth one in UK cities of Leicester, Coventry and Derby on November 21, 2021.\nThe huge participation of Sikhs in the referendum for their homeland has unnerved India.\nThe BJP government tried hard to stop the Sikh referendum exercise in the UK but its false propaganda failed to prevent the exercise as the UK allowed Sikh it.\nKhalistan referendum has sent a strong message to Indian establishment to end discrimination against Sikhs.\nSikhs For Justice has released a map of their vision of what Khalistan would entail. The map shows not just Punjab but Haryana and Himachal Pradesh as part of Khalistan.\nThe huge exercise of the referendum seems to have made the separate homeland for Sikhs the writing on the wall. The world community should also break its silence on the oppression of Sikhs in India.\nOn Thursday, Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) have submitted a report, ‘India’s Criminalization of Khalistan Referendum’, to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in a special meeting to inform the international body about India’s attempts to criminalise the entire Khalistan movement, particularly the ongoing Khalistan Referendum.\nA two-member delegation, comprising SFJ’s General Counsel Gurpatwant Singh Pannun and Council of Khalistan President Dr Bakhshish Singh Sandhu, briefed the UN officials on the Sikhs’ right to self-determination under international law, and the Modi government’s use of violence and sedition laws against Khalistan Referendum activists, in India and abroad.\nThey said that the Modi regime is also using various social media platforms to push hyper Indian nationalism and suppress the Khalistan Referendum campaign by blocking the contents and posts advocating for the liberation of Indian Punjab from India through the means of a ballot.",
