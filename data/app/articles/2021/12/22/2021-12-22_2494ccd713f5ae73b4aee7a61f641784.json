Indian police initially described the incident, which took place last month, as a counter-insurgency operation in which two militants and their associates had been killed in this gunfire.\nHowever, the families of three of the men that died have accused Indian forces of killing civilians and using them as human shields.\nTo add to the families’ grief the Indian authorities refused to initially hand over the bodies to the families and buried them in a graveyard 80km (50 miles) away. What’s the justification for this?, she asked.\nThis follows forces claiming they had killed three “unidentified hardcore terrorists” in a gunfight in Amshipora village of Kashmir’s Shopian district last July 2020, only to have the families of these young men strongly dispute that this is the case.\nDebbie Abrahams wrote that Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director of Human Rights Watch had called on the Indian authorities to have a transparent, credible and independent investigation into the Srinagar shopping complex incident.\n“We understand that Magisterial Inquiries are normally required in these circumstances, but given 108 magisterial probes have been ordered in Kashmir in the aftermath of violent incidents since 2008, and that none of the reports from these have been made public, nor has a single person been convicted, there is not much trust in the process,” she added.\nAs human rights advocates, we support Human Rights Watch’s request and look forward to your favourable response to this request, she added.\nIn conclusion, we would be grateful for your response concerning the welfare of Parvez, as well as an update on charges against him.\n“In addition we look forward to your response on establishing an independent and transparent inquiry into the killings of civilians by security forces at the Hyderpora shootout in November,” she added.\nKhurram Parvez, Kashmiri human rights activist, was arrested by India's National Investigation Agency in Srinagar and is currently reported to be imprisoned in New Delhi",
