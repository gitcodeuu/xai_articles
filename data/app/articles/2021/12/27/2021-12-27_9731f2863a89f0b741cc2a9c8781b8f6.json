I am warning the Indian government that people of IIOJK have now suffered for a long time. India has unleashed a perpetual and unending series of atrocities. How long could you think that you can be dominated by troops, police by BSF,” he remarked.\nFarooq Abdullah said the people of IIOJK were suffering. “They are suffering every day, every moment. Being Muslim people of IIOJK does not matter in the eyes of Indian establishment, they are treated like animals; media has been muzzled down and strangulated to a limit that if they report or write the truth they will be jailed or killed.”\nFarooq Abdullah said, “India today is highly communal. It is no more Gandhi’s India. It is Godse’s India, people of IIOJK have lost faith in international organizations and this hopelessness would lead to a civil war and if that happens, it will take India down, the system of oppression will destroy Indian federation.”\nMeanwhile, Pakistan has reiterated its call on the international community to hold India accountable for its grave and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law in IIOJK, which must be investigated by an independent Commission of Inquiry as recommended by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in its reports of 2018 and 2019.\nhttps://mofa.gov.pk/category/press-releases/\n“Pakistan strongly condemns extra-judicial killings of six more Kashmiris by Indian occupation forces in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” Foreign Office said in a statement.\n“India should be well aware that no amount of oppression and use of force can break the will of the valiant Kashmiri people who are resolutely standing up against India’s state-terrorism in IIOJK and struggling for their inalienable right to self-determination as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” it added.",
