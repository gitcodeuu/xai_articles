  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 08 (APP):National Security Adviser (NSA) Dr Moeed Yusuf has said that stable Afghanistan would eventually help avert future refugee crisis and ensure peace and development in the region.\nIn an interview to BBC World News programme Hard Talk by anchor Stephen Sackur, the NSA highlighted multiple aspects of the foreign policy, relations with Afghanistan and economic objective under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project.\nAbout current Afghan regime and global response, Dr Moeed said: “There is a government that many don’t like and it is not recognized … but there are 35-40 million Afghans who have nothing to do with this.” “Lets agree that they need to be fed immediately”, he added.\nHe said the world community may opt for dialogue with Taliban and added “Our message to the Afghan Taliban is identical to what the world is saying…. more inclusivity, no terrorism from Afghan soil, human rights for all and this what wewant.”\nThe NSA informed that Pakistan shared 1,600 miles border with Afghanistan and added after hospitality of four decades, four 4 million refugees were still in Pakistan. “Compare this to the EU, UK and US reactions towards refugees, shown up to your shores,” he asked the anchorperson.\n“The moment Afghanistan is unstable, my country goes unstable as we have a centuries old porous border which will cause refugee, terrorism, drugs flow over into Pakistan,” he added.\n“As NSA of Pakistan, it is my right to tell the world that the way the international community is approaching Afghanistan, it is heading for collapse and we are going to get hurt by it,” he noted.\nHe said Pakistan was not the one that brought war to Afghanistan, rather was the principal victim of this war. “We didn’t have suicide bombings in our country before 9/11. Since 9/11 over 80,000 causalities of Pakistanis which the West just likes to wish away. Over a $150 billion lost in the economy, 3.5 million internally displaced persons, and millions of Afghan refugees,” he added.\nDr Moeed said that Pakistan was duly recognized by the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) for facilitating the Doha peace process whose end point would have been a genuinely inclusive government.\nThe NSA took exception to the opening remarks of the anchorperson and said: “I object to your opening presenting as if Pakistan was behind all what happened. We didn’t aid or abet anybody…. there was a policy employed by the US and others who were in Afghanistan.”\nThere was always a policy failure in Afghanistan and Pakistan was the only country that took the stance that there was no military solution in Afghanistan, he added.\nTo a question, he said: “When I talk about Kashmir, I am talking about my people not foreign nationals and also an illegally occupied territory (IIOJK) recognized as a dispute by the United Nations (UN) and this is my right to speak about my people and not speaking about any foreign country at that point in time”.\nCommenting on the Pak-US ties and CPEC, he said Pakistan had a major transition in its approach from a geo-strategic to geo-economic paradigm. “It’s one key pillar is connectivity and the other is development partnerships,” he added.\nThe NSA, explaining the CPEC project, said Pakistan had a strategic relationship with China and this was going from strength to strength. “But that is not at the cost of any other country that is what our geo-economic paradigm is all about,” he added.\nHe pointed out the CPEC was energy and road infrastructure that anybody could benefit from and invest in Pakistan.",
