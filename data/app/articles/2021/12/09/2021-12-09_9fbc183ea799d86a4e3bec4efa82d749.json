  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 9 (APP):National Security Adviser (NSA) Dr Moeed Yusuf on Thursday said the country needed a concerted whole of nation approach to end intolerance from the society and stigmatize violence or taking law into their hands by extremist factions as a taboo.\nThe NSA was addressing the session on Importance of Sustainable Development Goals for National Security in the Context of Current Regional Development during the Sustainable Development Conference 2021 Beyond the Pandemic: Leaving No One Behind organized by the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI).\nDr. Moeed said the incidents like Sialkot lynching were referred to as acts of extremism whereas it was intolerance that could be in any form and as a society the nation had to seriously work out its eradication.\nHe added that the Prime Minister and the government were very clear the state monopoly could never be challenged over violence. It was the society’s responsibility to make “taking law into ones hand” as a taboo so that no individual could dare to do that in the future, he added.\nThe NSA stated that there was no risk of terrorism resurgence in the country as the security authorities and forces have gone under massive capacity buildup which had ensured defence of the country against all threats.\nCommenting on the prevailing Afghanistan situation and global response, the NSA warned the international community about the looming humanitarian disaster in Afghanistan as four million Afghans are at the brink of catastrophic human disaster amid US sanctions hampering humanitarian assistance.\nHe added that the banking sanctions had prohibited the international donor agencies like the UN and ICRC to use their bank accounts for humanitarian assistance.\n“If they cannot operate then who else could help Afghan facing merciless cold weather during ongoing winters without anything. There is liquidity crisis in Afghanistan as all banking channels are blocked,” the NSA questioned the indifferent international community.\nHe said Pakistan has pledged US$30 million and lowered all regulations to assist humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and making all out efforts in its humble capacity.\n“However, the countries like the US, Russia, China and others have pledged assistance to Afghanistan and in the prevailing sanctions no one can support them,” he regretted.\nIt was really unethical to question Pakistan’s preparedness for coping with refugee crisis where it was already looking after four million Afghan refugees, instead of negotiating to avert the crisis, the NSA said.",
