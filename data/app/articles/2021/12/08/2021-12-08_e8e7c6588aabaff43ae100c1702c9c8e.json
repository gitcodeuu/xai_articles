  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 8 (APP):Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Capital Development Authority (CDA) Affairs Ali Nawaz Awan Wednesday appealed to the FDE teachers to restore academic activities in the schools by calling off protest at the earliest.\n“No change has been made in the job structure of the FDE teachers in the Islamabad Capital Territory Local Government Ordinance 2021,” he told a press conference.\nThere would be no change in their pay, scale as well as their status of federal government, he said adding the Mayor of Islamabad would only have oversight powers.\nHe said around 200,000 students, who already faced educational loss during the Covid-19 pandemic were deprived of education due to ongoing protest of teachers.\nAli Nawaz said the Senate Standing Committee on Education and Professional Training in its recent meeting had asked the protesting teachers of the Federal Directorate of Education (FDE) to call off its strike.\nHe said teachers were misguided on the Ordinance and they went on strike without understanding its clauses that had nothing to do with the current job structure of the teachers.\nHe said government was ready to negotiate with them [teachers] and accept their legal demands if any. However they should end boycotting classes and open schools at the earliest, he added.\nThe SAPM expressed the hope that the teachers would restore academic process after ending the ongoing strike to prevent any further education loss of the students.",
