Over 7.70 million families have been registered so far.\nEhsaas Rashan Riayat programme aimed to reduce the impact of inflation for the marginalized segments of society. Under the programme, a subsidy of Rs. 1,000 a month will be granted to each of the eligible families on the purchase of flour, pulses, ghee/cooking oil.\nThe Rs. 120 billion targeted subsidies programme will cover 20 million families; overall 130 million people will benefit nationwide which equated to 53% of the country’s population.\nEhsaas Rashan Registration was currently underway, nationwide. Families earning less than Rs. 50,000 a month could register themselves under the Rashan programme of Ehsaas through 8171. Only one member of an applicant family whose cell number was issued on his personal Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) can enrol his/her family through 8171 SMS service. Kiryana shopkeepers can register through the web portal: https://ehsaasrashan.pass.gov.pk/.\nEhsaas has developed a digitally enabled mobile point of sale system (mPOS)/app in collaboration with National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) to serve beneficiaries through a network of Kiryana stores designated by NBP, all over the country.\nThe government will incentivize Kiryana merchants by giving them attractive commission (5-8%) on Ehsaas’ subsidy amount to encourage them to benefit more and more people. Based on performance, there will also be a lucky draw for Kiryana merchants giving away cars, motorcycles, mobile phones and various other prizes every quarter.\nIn the current fiscal year, the budget of the programme for the next six months is Rs. 120 billion under the federal-provincial cost sharing arrangement.\nThe federal government and all participating federating units will share fiscal resources in the proportion of 35/65.
