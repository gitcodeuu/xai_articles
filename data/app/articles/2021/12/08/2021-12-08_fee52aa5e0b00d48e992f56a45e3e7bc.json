  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 08 (APP):A sub-committee of the Senate Standing Committee on Housing and Works Wednesday directed the officials of the Pakistan Works Department (PWD) to submit details and authorization letters of the individuals to whom the projects of installing Tube wells and water filtration plants in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had been handed over in due course of time.\nThe sub-committee met here under convenership of Senator Kamal Ali Agha. Apart from Senator Afnanullah Khan, Secretary for Housing and Works and PWD officials attended the committee meeting. Kamil Ali Agha also sought an inquiry report within two days regarding the staff posted in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Grade-14 and above. The body expressed satisfaction over the details adapted by the officials of PWD Batkhela Division in regards to the news published in print media about malpractices and corruption in the PWD Batkhela division.\nThe officials of the PWD Batkhela submitted the decision of the Peshawar High Court and the report of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA)  on the matter. The PWD officials submitted tenders, advertisements, and handing/taking over statements to the committee regarding tube wells and water filtration plants installed in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nThe convener committee questioned whether these projects were handed over to the community, to which the Secretary of Housing and Works said that some projects were handed over to the community and run/maintained by them.  Regarding the delivery of the projects to the community, PWD officials informed the sub-committee that community members submit an application for need-based projects to the Deputy Commissioner (DC) with a copy of their identity cards which is further processed as per SOPs.\nThe convener committee inquired about the adoption of the procedure and the authority who handed over these projects.  Kamil Ali Agha expressed resentment and said that a project that costs Rs. 4,000,000 to 8,000,000 were handed over to the individuals without having any nomination/authorization letter.\nSecretary of Housing and Works underlined that the projects were handed over to the community but nothing happens in writing. While agreeing with the point of the Convener, the Secretary said that an Authorization letter must be there at the time of handing over the scheme.  He said a plan needs to be envisaged so that written proof is also submitted at the time of handing over the community-based projects to the individuals.",
