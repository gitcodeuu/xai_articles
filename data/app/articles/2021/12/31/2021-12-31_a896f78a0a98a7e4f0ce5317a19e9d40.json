Pakistani pilgrims would visit India though the PIA flights whereas Air India would bring Indian passengers to Pakistan.\nHe expressed the hope that the promotion of religious tourism could bring the people of the two countries closer to each other.\nDr Ramesh said “every month one delegation from Pakistan side would also leave for India for visiting Dargah of Khwaja Nizam Uddin Aulia in New Dehli and Dargah of Khawaja Ghareeb Nawaz in Ajmer Sharif. While one international delegation would also arrive in Pakistan for visiting religiously significant sites of Hinduism, including the Samadhi of Shri Param Hans Ji Maharaj / Teri Temple and Hinglaj Mata Temple Balochistan,” he said.\nDr Ramesh said Pakistan Hindu Council had reached an important agreement with PIA according to which Hindu pilgrims across the world, including India, were to be facilitated on pilgrimage to holy places in Pakistan.\nHowever, he said Indian pilgrims were not allowed by the Indian government to fly on Pakistani airline and that was why, now they would first reach Lahore via Wagah border and then fly to Peshawar by special flight.\n“Pakistan Hindu Council has also decided to cooperate with Air India for the provision of transport facilities to Indian pilgrims,” he said, informing that Air India flights would be operated from New Delhi to Peshawar and Karachi next month in February.",
