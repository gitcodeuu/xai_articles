If we don’t opt that course, it will be great treachery with the Indian Muslims who had voted for it,” he remarked.\nHe said some leaders in the past claimed to make Pakistan an Asian Tiger which could in no way be greater than the idea of a welfare state like Madina.\nThe prime minister told the gathering that the time would prove that initiative of Sehat Card, involving almost equal funding, would have far better outcomes than the Metro Buses or Orange Train.\nHe said all families across the province would get the Sehat Card by March and also resolved to replicate the model in Balochistan, Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan.\nThe prime minister said the Sehat Card would lead towards the development of health infrastructure across the province as it would attract the private sector to build hospitals even in remote areas.\nHe said the government would close down the government hospitals in far-flung areas where the doctors did not want to be posted, to save the cost.\nHe said the government would incentivize the private sector by allowing duty-free import of their equipment to expand the network of private hospitals.\nThe prime minister told the gathering that a silent revolution was in the making through the government’s initiative of housing construction loans by banks for the salaried class after the government removed all the impediments.\nHe said the people had applied for loans worth Rs 260 billion out of which Rs 110 billion worth loans had been approved and Rs 34 billion disbursed already.\nHe said under Kamyab Pakistan Program, around 2 million people had been given interest-free loans for house building. Moreover, under the same program, a loan of Rs 0.5 million was also being given to the farmers and others to establish their own businesses.\nThrough the Ehsaas Ration scheme, almost 54% of the population was being given a 30% subsidy on the purchase of ghee, flour and pulses.\nEarlier, the prime minister also distributed Sehat Cards among the beneficiaries.\nIn his address, Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar said the provincial government had allocated Rs 399 billion health budget compared to Rs 169 billion from 2013-18.\nHe said 23 big hospitals were nearing completion, the up-gradation of 158 health facilities had been completed while 78 projects were in the pipeline.\nHe said the provincial government was spending Rs 37.5 billion on the purchase of medicines.\nMoreover, he said the government would soon fulfill its commitment by filling 100,000 vacancies.",
