  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 31 (APP):Vaccination centers mandated to inoculate Covid vaccines will remain closed across the country on 1st and 2nd January, 2022.\nAccording to National Command and Operation Center (NCOC), it had to make this tough decision as its staff was engaged in achieving yesteryear’s targets.\nThe vaccination campaign will resume from January 3, 2022. It will continue aiding the citizens for protection against the pandemic and the new strains, with renewed hope and stronger determination.\nIn the similiar vein, Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib lauded the efforts of NCOC in a tweet on Friday stating that another milestone has been achieved as 70 million people have already been vaccinated across the country including Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\nIn the meanwhile, NCOC has allowed Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) to host Pakistan Super League (PSL)-7 with 100% attendance of spectators and players on the condition of compliance of SOPs.\nHowever, only vaccinated individuals will be issued tickets for the events. The seventh edition of PSL is set to commence from January 27. Furthermore, NCOC warned in a tweet on Thursday to be cautious of a fake email being circulated asking the citizens to register for COVID-19 vaccination, which is being wrongly attributed to NCOC.",
