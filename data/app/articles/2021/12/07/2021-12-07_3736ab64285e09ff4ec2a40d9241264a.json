She explained the Blue Economy as per WB definition as sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods, jobs, and preserving marine ecosystems.\nShe suggested that the Chinese Geological Survey and Pakistan Navy survey (Behr e Masah) found marine reserves of 22,590 million tonnes of oil equivalent (MTOE) that the country should preserve and promote aquaculture in its coastal regions.\nProf Dr. Babar Shahbaz of the University of Agriculture Faisalabad said Pakistan’s 50 percent land of its total area of 79.6 million hectares comprised of rangelands whereas only 28 percent of the total area was cultivated.\nHe proposed that the ecosystem restoration has to be holistic along with ecosystem supportive food security policies, improving land management for promising outcomes.\nDr. Shahbaz noted that the rangelands of the country were mostly ignored and were given the least importance when ecosystem restoration was planned that needed to be considered keeping in view its potential.\nIn his vote of thanks, Executive Director SDPI Dr. Abid Suleri extended his gratitude to the panelists for shedding light on the important topics.\nHe said the future generations would have to carry the solutions of ecosystem restoration like the facemask we were adapted with during the Covid-19 pandemic.\nDr. Suleri announced that the recommendations shared at the forum related to Pakistan would be sent to the relevant ministries for their consumption and knowledge.",
