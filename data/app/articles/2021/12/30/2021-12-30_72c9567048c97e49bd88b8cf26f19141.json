  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 30 (APP): Pakistan on Thursday strongly condemned the extra-judicial killing of six Kashmiri youth in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) by the Indian occupation forces in the last two days.\nIn the escalating campaign of repression in IIOJK, including fake encounters and so-called cordon-and-search-operations, at least 24 Kashmiris have been martyred in the month of December so far, Foreign Office Spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said in a statement issued here.\n“Equally reprehensible are the continuing human rights violations in IIOJK, including arbitrary detentions, humiliation and harassment of Kashmiris,” he added.\nThe Spokesperson said that the international community must take cognizance of the deteriorating situation in IIOJK and hold India accountable for its unrelenting oppression of Kashmiris with total impunity in complete disregard of international law.\n“It is equally important that relevant international, UN and OIC human rights bodies thoroughly investigate incidents of fake encounters in IIOJK including the one in Hyderpora in November 2021 – in which the Indian occupation forces are now desperately trying to cover up the massacre of 4 Kashmiris through fabrication and lies,” he added.\n“Pakistan will continue to expose the BJP-RSS combine’s tyranny in IIOJK, as we steadfastly stand by the Kashmiri people in their just struggle for the right to self-determination as promised to them by the UN Security Council,” the Spokesperson maintained.",
