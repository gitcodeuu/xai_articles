We only support them for political engagements with international community,” he noted.\nHe said the Taliban needs to evolve an indigenous system that was acceptable to all groups locally and internationally.\nPakistan’s main interest is to bring political and economic stability in war-torn country after 50 years of political turmoil.\nDuring past years, he said Afghan regimes never had an entire control of country’s territories that provided space to various terrorist groups.\nAt present the Taliban government has full control over the country, he said adding if the present government addresses humanitarian, educational, and economic issues as well as continue to extend cooperation with international community in counter-terrorism, that eventually end an era of war in Afghanistan and move the country towards stability prosperity.\nHe emphasized the need for creating an environment to expand bilateral ties between both the countries with cooperation in various fields including health, education, commerce, agriculture,  industry etc.\nResponding to a query about women education in Afghanistan, he said after August 15, the new Taliban regime had started higher education for girls across 12 provinces in the country, hoping that girls schools would be reopened in rest of the provinces soon.\nThere was a need to provide such kind of environment where cultural barriers may be addressed by establishing separate schools for girls and arrangements of segregated classes, he maintained.\nPakistan has provided every possible assistance to Afghan nationals in education sector, he said, adding that over 50,000 Afghans were serving in public and private sectors of their country after getting an education in Pakistan.\nAround 1,000 scholarships were awarded to Afghan nationals by Pakistani government with 100 seats reserved for girls.\nAbout the recognition of new Taliban regime, he emphasized the need to adopt a comprehensive approach and coordinated efforts with international community for obtaining desired outcomes.\nPakistan’s main focus was to engage the international community with Afghanistan on humanitarian issue,\neconomic front and later other matters.\nCommenting on Afghan visa policy, he said Pakistan has eased visa process after making it online to facilitate people of the neighbour country.\nThe Envoy said India always used Afghan land as a launching platform to carry out terrorist activities against Pakistan.
