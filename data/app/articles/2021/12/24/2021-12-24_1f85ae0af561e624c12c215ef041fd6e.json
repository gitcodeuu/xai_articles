His hard work enabled him to make assets in Mumbai, Delhi, Simla, Karachi and Lahore, the minister added.\nThe minister said, the great Quaid-e-Azam was a role model, particularly for the people of subcontinent.\nTalking about Kashmir, the minister said that the struggle that had started in 1931, when 22 youth were martyred by Dogra forces, was continuing till date.\nHe said that inclusion of Muslim majority Gurdaspura district in India and later on the fabricated instrument of accession document paved way for Indian occupation of Kashmir.",
