It was also revealed that Nawaz Sharif owned four flats in Mayfair, London where even a British Prime Minister could not afford purchase of the apartments in such posh area, he added.\nHe said when Maryam was asked about ownership of those flats after investigation; she flatly denied and said she did not have any property anywhere.\nThe minister also recalled that Maryam produced a document in the court to prove her innocence, but later it proved ‘fake’ due to its printing in the Calibri font which was not even launched by that time.\nLashing out at the Sharif family for getting failed to produce any genuine evidence before the court, public and media, the minister said many opportunities were given to them so that they could prove their innocence, but they rather resorted to delaying tactics and tricks for misleading the nation.\n“Section 9 of NAB ordinance says that it shall be considered as a corrupt practice, if someone fails to prove the source of money from which a property was purchased,” he said while wondering as to why the Sharif family was not submitting their money trail in the court in their defense.\nAlmost every child in the country knew about corruption made by Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari during their governmental tenures, he said, referring to demand of the nation that the Sharif family must submit their money trail.\nAbout the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in elections and i-voting for the overseas Pakistanis, Fawad said the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) should expedite the process in that regard and fulfill its responsibility as the law had already been passed.\nHe said Prime Minister Imran Khan had directed Minister for Interior Sheikh Rashid for taking up the matter related to the passport so the expatriate Pakistanis could vote in a hassle-free way.\nThe minister said International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme had been approved which ushered in economic stability.\nTo another query, he said Minister for Economic Affairs Omar Ayub Khan had informed the State Bank of Pakistan through a letter that funding of a programme recently held in a local hotel in Islamabad was ‘illegal’.\nHe reiterated that a thorough investigation would be conducted in the funding of that programme. EAD (Economic Division Affairs) had started investigating the funding and Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) would formulate a report on that matter.“We will proceed according to the law,” he added.",
