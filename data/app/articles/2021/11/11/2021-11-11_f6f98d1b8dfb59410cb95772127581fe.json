Waqar un Nisa Women College had also been upgraded and made a university, he added.\nRawalpindi was at top position in female education across the country for last 10 years, he said adding that today, admission merit was so high here as it had reached at 92 percent marks.“We tried to provide education facilities at the door steps of the female students.
