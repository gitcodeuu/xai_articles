But unfortunately the rulers of Sindh were paying no attention to it, he added. Gill said those responsible for the deteriorating situation in Karachi have been ruling the Sindh for the last two decades.\nZardari Mafia captured 310 acres of government land worth Rs 15 billion in West Karachi District, he added. He said in Karachi, 89,000 acres of government land and 2,800,000 acres of forest lands had also been encroached.\nGill said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government has started to give rights to Karachi for the first time.\nThe federal government has earmarked Rs 98 billion under transformation plan to Karachi during the current fiscal year, he added. Similarly, he said, an amount of Rs 22 billion was specified to generate electricity from coal in Jamshoro.",
