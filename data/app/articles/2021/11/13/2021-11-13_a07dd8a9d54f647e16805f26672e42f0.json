  "content": "ISLAMABAD, nov 13 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan Saturday expressed his concerns over the slow pace of development projects under Southern Balochistan Development Package and directed to hold the meeting of the Apex Committee every month to review the projects’ execution.\nThe prime minister, who chaired a high-level meeting to review the realization of the package, also instructed for holding the meeting of the execution committee fortnightly to speed up work on 200 development projects worth Rs. 655 billion.\nHe was told that that only one meeting of the Apex Committee was held in a year which was headed by the chief minister of the province.\nThe prime minister directed the authorities concerned to complete Turbat Airport and build two nursing colleges in Gwadar and Turbat at the earliest.\nImran Khan said that he would personally hold review committee meetings every month to remove impediments in the completion of the development projects.\nHe viewed that the issues faced by Balochistan were different from the rest of the country as its population was scattered, and due to long distance between the localities, the government would have to find out-of-the-box solutions to improve the lives of the people of Balochistan.\nHe directed ministries of planning, energy, maritime affairs, and the Government of Balochistan to work in close coordination to accelerate the work on transport, energy and infrastructure projects under the Package.\nEarlier the prime minister was briefed that Balochistan was a resource-rich province as it produces 40% of the locally produced gas in the country. Ownership of the federal government was very much needed to solve various issues being faced by this strategically very important province.\nThe prime minister directed the Balochistan government to revamp its governance structure at the grassroots level not only to accelerate the pace of work on development projects but also to improve the service delivery to the common man.\nHe also directed the authorities concerned to launch an effective media campaign to ensure maximum public awareness of the government’s initiatives for the welfare of the people of Balochistan.\nThe meeting was attended by Energy Minister Muhammad Hammad Azhar, Industries Minister Makhdoom Khusro Bakhtiar, Information Minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain, Maritime Affairs Minister Syed Ali Haider Zaidi, Planning Minister Asad Umar, Advisor on Finance Shaukat Fayyaz Tarin, Chief Minister Balochistan Abdul Quddus Bizenjo and other senior officers concerned.",
