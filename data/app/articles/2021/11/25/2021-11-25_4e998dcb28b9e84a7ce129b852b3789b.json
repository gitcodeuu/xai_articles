  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 25 (APP): National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage-Lok Virsa in collaboration with The Curtain Raiser Productions (CRP) on Thursday presented “Giraah”, a play by Muhammad Ali Farooqi.\nThe play was featuring six lunatics running around lose-ends and starring Muhammad Ali Farooqi, Imran, Abrar Bazmi, Shehryar Shahid, Tahir Inqalab Syed, Zain Tariq Sahi and Bushra Yamin.\nThe event was held at Rooftop Auditorium.\nThis thriller play was set in a mental asylum.The story then simultaneously follows the story of six patients and the guilt that drove them mad. Reasons for their madness include not doing enough, and doing too much. From listening and being deceived, to not listening at all.\nEach patient had their own issues and it seemed like there really was no winning.Eventually, all the patients end up influencing one another through their different patterns. Chaos ultimately follows.\nThe play addresses our own unwillingness to push for resolution and reform in society. Perhaps this is why life has become a tragedy and why folks end up in a mental asylum.\nThe Curtain Raiser is an emerging theatre group from Islamabad. People from different walks of life attended the event. Strict SOPs were followed as per Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) administration.",
