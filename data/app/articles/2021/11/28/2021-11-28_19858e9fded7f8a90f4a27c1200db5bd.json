Despite everything , the Palestinian people are still clinging to their national identity and resisting Israeli plots to eliminate our culture and heritage.\nPalestinians have been living in the land of Palestine for thousands of years while struggling to maintain their identity and integrity guaranteed first by their massive sacrifices in the course.\nThe modern history of Palestine, which has been represented by hundreds of thousands of martyrs, wounded and prisoners, as well as the UN resolutions in its various organizations and branches have also guaranteed them, and also included the obligations that the occupying power tries to evade from by establishing alternative paths and by disavowing their commitments and by practicing the most severe violations against the Palestinian people.\nA just solution to the Palestinian issue requires an end to the new apartheid regime imposed by the Israeli occupation force and an end to its occupation of the Palestinian land that has continued since June 5, 1967, including Jerusalem , which is also a prelude to resolving all crises in the region , and an entry point for the Palestinian people to restore their pioneering civilization role in building the values of the humanitarian system that the peoples of the world seek, on their land and in their independent and sovereign state on the 1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital.\nThe Embassy highly evaluates our historical relations with Pakistan for the last 8 decades , we are proud of Pakistan’s friendship and we feel stronger with it’s support on official and public levels.\nInstitutions and bodies that express on a daily basis their solidarity with the Palestinian people and their rights.\nThe Palestinian embassy in Pakistan appreciates the historical Pakistani fraternal stances in supporting the Palestinian people to obtain their rights . “We also extend our appreciation to the friends of Palestine around the world for their support and solidarity on the Day of the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People and in their expression of their adherence to the values of justice and freedom.\nLong live Palestine, long live Pakistan , long live countries and peoples that love freedom peace and justice, the statement concluded",
