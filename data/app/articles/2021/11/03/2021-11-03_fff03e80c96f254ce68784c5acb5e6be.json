Pakistan’s system is much compliant to FATF as compared to most of the countries, present on this platform….our enforcement measures are far effective to them,” he said.\nWith these measures, Hammad Azhar said, Pakistan’s future generations would get benefit due to lasting peace in the region and world. “It will greatly help check the menace like money-laundering, through which billions of dollars of poor countries are illegally shifted to other countries every year,” he added.\nDirector General National FATF Secretariat Khawaja Adnan Zahir, in his welcome address to the concluding session of Pakistan’s first 9-day Assessors Course, highlighted the importance of the training for law enforcement agencies and other departments, keeping in view the massive challenges the country faced over the last three years.\nDuring the past decade, he said, the global AML/CFT landscape had changed tremendously and regulatory checks on it had increased. “The economic and political image of many countries have been tainted because of issues like ML/TF [Money Laundering & Terrorism Financing],” he said adding Pakistan had throughout been one of the most affected countries from ML/TF issues due to numerous reasons.\nAt the same time, the DG said, Pakistan’s resolve to fight back these challenges remained unprecedented. “In order to effectively address these challenges, it is important that we build a strong AML/CFT compliance regime by enhancing capacity of our institutions and the forefront officers.”\nHe said such training courses would help Pakistan safeguard integrity and reputation of its system, besides producing the experts who would represent the country at international forums.\nDirector National FATF Secretariat Rizwana Qazi presented a detailed briefing on working and objectives of the Secretariat, and structure of the training course that was attended by officers from different departments.\nLater, Minister for Energy awarded certificates among participants of the ‘Assessors Course,’ were from different departments and ministries like Customs, FBR and National Counter Terrorist Authority, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Law and Justice and some others.\nThe course participants and the National FATF Secretariat officials took a group photo with the minister.\nEarlier upon arrival, Hammad Azahar unveiled the plaque of a newly established training hall at the secretariat.",
