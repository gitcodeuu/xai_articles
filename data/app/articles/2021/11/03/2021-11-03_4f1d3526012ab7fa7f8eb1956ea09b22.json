  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (APP): The Punjab police in the line of duty have faced the fury of several mobs in the past, but the ruthless brutality by the protesters of Tehreek e Labaik Pakistan in the recent episode of violence has led to the death of six of their personnel.\nThe TLP, since its inception, conducted six violent marches onto the federal capital, in which precious lives were lost while losses ran into billions of rupees as businesses suffered innumerable damage. However, the emotional loss of the loved ones has left the families seeking answers which no one can provide.\nIn the recent clashes, six policemen were martyred and over a thousand injured in violent protests, vandalism and deadly attacks on policemen by Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).\nAccording to Inspector General of Police (IGP) Punjab Rao Sardar Ali Khan, 741 police personnel were injured in the clashes. He told a press conference that violent protests, vandalism, damage to public and private property and deadly attacks on police personnel by TLP were a challenge to the writ of the state.\nThe IGP said the TLP during a sit-in at Faizabad in 2017 even refused to give way to an ambulance, resulting in death of a patient.\n“The police officers and personnel on duty to protect the lives and property of the people have utmost respect and love for Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and view Him as ‘Rehmattul-lil-Alameen’.”\nThe IG regretted that scores of private and government properties and vehicles were vandalized as the mobsters raised slogans of Namoos-e-Risalat (PBUH), which he said, was contrary to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\nDuring the recent protests by TLP, two police personnel from Lahore got martyred on October 22; including Head Constable Ayub and Constable Khalid Javed.\nIn a single day alone, 15 injured police constables were brought to the Services Hospital, 16 to Mayo Hospital, 7 to Mian Munshi Hospital, one each to Farooq Hospital, Nawaz Sharif and Kot Khawaja Saeed Hospital, 3 injured to Gangaram Hospital. A total of 309 policemen were injured during a recent clash with a banned organization. The injured also included DSP Naveed, Inspector Masood, SHO Kahna, SHO Gawalmandi. The other police personnel were killed in later clashes with the TLP protesters.\nThe video footage of grief-stricken families of the police martyrs shocked the nation as they saw their young children questioning the police bosses, “Can you bring my Baba back?”\nThe Jhang Police on its Twitter handle shared another video of the funeral of the ASI Mohammad Akbar Umar of Lahore Police who got injured at Sadhoki, and succumbed to injuries in Lahore and was martyred Nov 1. Police and the workes of the Tehreek-e-Labiak Pakistan had a major clash at Sadhoki, as the protesters exited Lahore.\nAnother gruesome murder was that of Adnan Ehsan, a police constable who was abducted near Gujranwala by TLP workers in Wazirabad during the protests. He was badly beaten and his tortured body was dumped in the nearby fields and could only be identified after a detailed investigation.\nVideo footage of the mother of Constable Ghulam Rasool showed her saying; “For mothers, the death of their children is like losing their own life. My son had a great love for Holy Prophet (PBUH). My son sacrificed his life for the Islam and this country.”\nShe recalled how Ghulam Rasool used to send her money to hold Mehfil-e-Naat back home.\nThe brother of Ghulam Rasool said; “I am proud of my brother’s martyrdom. My brother was true Ashiq-e-Rasool (PBUH) and used to pray five times a day.”\nGhulam Rasool’s mother-in-law, while trying to console his daughter (Ghulam Rasool’s widow), said “how can I calm down my daughter when I am myself in a distress”.\nOn April 12, the provincial capital of Lahore witnessed violent protests by the religious party after TLP chief Saad Rizvi was arrested for threatening the government with rallies if it did not expel the French envoy to Islamabad over cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) published in France last year.\nThese included Constable Mohammad Afzal who got martyred in Shahdara Chowk, Constable Mohammad Imran was martyred near Karol Ghati Mehmood Booti.\nConstable Shafqat Ali (42) got injured in the violent protests and after a life-and-death struggle for two months, finally succumbed to his injuries.  He was undergoing treatment in his hometown Pindi Bhattian and was posted at Gujjarpura police station.\nWhile the senior police administration remains committed to providing the best of facilities and support to the bereaved families, they still have a rocky road ahead, particularly for the young children who lost their loving fathers. For a few days, the senior police officials might be accompanying them to school, but the children need a father, more than that.",
