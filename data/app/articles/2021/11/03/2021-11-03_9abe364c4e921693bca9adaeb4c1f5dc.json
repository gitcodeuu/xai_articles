She invited the women to benefit from the business loans offered by the government and the State Bank of Pakistan.\nOn differently-abled persons, she said, the marginalized segment deserved special care and opportunities in all fields of life for their effective mainstreaming in society.\nPresident RCCI Chaudry Nadeem Rauf said acknowledging the important role of women in society, the RCCI had taken several key initiatives to ensure their empowerment, including setting up business incubation centres.\nHe said to address the challenges pertaining to the wellbeing of women, the RCCI would continue to extend them support on the health issues such as breast cancer.\nRCCI officer-bearers Sohail Altaf and Arooj Saqib said the RCCI would continue to raise the campaign on breast awareness to save the precious lives of women.\nThe event was attended by parliamentarians, women entrepreneurs, and the girl students of colleges and universities.",
