In this Islamophobic hatred, India will destroy itself, no less,” he wrote in a tweet.\nHe said, “I hope and pray that sane elements within Indian society prevent this.”\nThe president also quoted Czech writer Milan Kundera as saying that ‘the first step in liquidating a people is to erase its memory. Destroy its books, its culture, destroy its history. Then have somebody write new books, manufacture a new culture, invent a new history’.\n‘Before long that nation will begin to forget what it is and what it was… The struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting,’ the president wrote referring to Kundera.",
