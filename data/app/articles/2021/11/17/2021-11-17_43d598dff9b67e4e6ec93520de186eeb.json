  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 17 (APP): In Indian illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), the families of the four civilians, who were cold-bloodedly murdered by Indian forces in fake encounters in Hyderpora locality of Srinagar were joined by a large number of people on Wednesday to protest against brutal killings on a second consecutive day.\nThe protest was held not only to denounce the Indian brutality but also to demand the dead bodies of martyrs including a doctor and three traders, who were secretly buried by the Indian forces in the Hindwara area of North Kashmir’s Kupwara district.\nAccording to local media, including Greater Kashmir, people joined the families of martyred civilians including Dr Mudasir Gul and Altaf Ahmad in a protest sit-in at Press Enclave Srinagar, demanding dead bodies so that they could accord them a proper burial.\nMurdering Kashmiris in cold blood has become a pastime of Indian troops in IIOJK, which has virtually been turned into a killing field where systematic genocide of Kashmiris is being carried through such fake encounters.\n“The extra-judicial killing of innocent Kashmiris in Hyderpora Srinagar by the fascist Modi regime only confirms what we had stated in our dossier on fake encounters in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir,” Dr Moeed Yusuf said in a tweet.\nHe said “India must understand that no amount of systematic brutalities, rampant use of force or brutal clamp-downs can suppress the indigenous Kashmiri struggle.”\nPakistan’s dossier on gross human rights violations clearly points that the history of Kashmiris’ freedom movement was full of gruesome fake encounters and killing Kashmiris in fake encounters was a policy of the fascist Modi regime.\nModi regime, in a bid to implement its dirty plan of ethnic cleansing in IIOJK, is killing Kashmiris in staged encounters. The aim is to subjugate the Kashmiri people by killing youth in fake encounters, a Kashmiri resident, fearing reprsial and resident of Srinagar said.\nThe cold-blooded murder of the civilians has sparked a sharp reaction from all sections of society. The pro-India Jammu and Kashmir National Conference President Dr Farooq, in a tweet demanded an impartial probe into the civilian killings and sought Lieutenant Governor Manoj Sinha’s intervention in handing over bodies to their kin.\nUsing Kashmiris as a human shield and killing them in encounters has become a routine matter. Chairperson Pro-India Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Mehbooba Mufiti said that it has been a practice to dub people killed in such encounters as Over Ground Workers (OGWs).\nA prominent Hurriyat activist, Mushaal Hussein Mullick termed the act as barbaric and tyrannical.\nPro-Indian National Conference leader, Omar Abdullah said police themselves termed the martyred people to be civilians and how come they were murdered.\nMeanwhile, heart-wrenching scenes from videos being shared on various social media platforms, of wailing family members of the Kashmiris have shocked the people.\nKashmiri and human rights activists all across the world denounced in strong terms the brutal murder of Kashmiris. Social media including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and other social sites are replete with messages of people, denouncing Indian barbarism and expressing sympathy with the affected families.\nThe killing of Kashmiri in fake encounters is a blatant violation of the United Nations Charter, hence, it is the responsibility of the international community to intervene and stop India from massacring Kashmiris while the global rights’ bodies must take notice of fake encounters in IIOJK.",
