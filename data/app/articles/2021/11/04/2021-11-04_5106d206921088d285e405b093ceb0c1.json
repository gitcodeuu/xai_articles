  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 4 (APP): The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government, during its last three years in power, took a number of practical measures to transform Pakistan on the pattern of an ideal welfare state of Madina by uplifting poor segments of the society.\nThe government believed in tolerance, brotherhood, peaceful co-existence of mankind and a social system based on justice, equality and negation of all types of discrimination, which is a true spirit of Islam.\nAccordingly, it made untiring efforts to practically implement the teachings of Islam and the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhmmad (Peace Be Upon Him) for the welfare of downtrodden segments of the society, launching a flagship ‘Ehsaas’ (Compassion) programme to facilitate poor farmers, patients and needy with a ‘people-centric’ approach.\nTo end discrimination, the government on July 18, 2019 decided that the Federal Board of Education would be responsible to conduct exams of compulsory subjects in madrassas and issuing consolidated results of matric and intermediate level so that Madrassa students could be able to complete with other students.\nOn December 19, 2019, it established Directorate General of Religious Education (DGRE) along with its 16 regional offices to mainstream all religious seminaries by improving standard of education there.\nOn December 10, 2020, the government initiated Ph.D. Program on Seerat-un-Nabi (SAW) to highlight all aspects of the life of the Prophet (PBUH).\nIt also launched Al-Qadir University as a research hub and character building facility based on the golden principles of Islam. At present the Sufi and Research blocks, hostel and faculty residences are under construction.\nOn April 15, 2021, the government started the Rehmatul lil Alameen scholarship program for intermediate and undergraduate students including non-Muslims.\nOn August 16, 2021, it included a chapter about Seerat-un-Nabi (PBUH) in curriculum wherein the teachings of the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) had been made compulsory for the 8th, 9th and 10th classes.\nOn August 21, 2021, the government passed a resolution making it mandatory to write ‘Khatam-un-Nabiyeen’ (finality of the Holy Prophet Muhammad’s (SAW) name in official documents, books and wherever the Holy name is used.\nOn October 5, 2021, the government officially launched first-ever official Ashra of Rahmatul lil Alameen (Peace Be Upon Him) to mark Eid Milad-un-Nabi in a befitting manner, besides announcing formation of Rahmatul lil Alameen Authority to promote research on matters of Seerat, to counter misconceptions at the global level about Islam.\nThe authority is aimed at promoting and propagating teachings of the Holy Prophet (PBUH); and undertaking initiatives to shape narratives from the Seerat for the young generation.\nWhereas at international level, Prime Minister Imran Khan while addressing the 14th OIC summit in Makkah on June 1, 2019 said blasphemous acts against Prophet Mohammad (Peace Be Upon Him) in the western world was the failure of OIC for not explaining to them (the western world) the love and affection the Muslims had for the Holy Prophet (PBUH).\nHe urged the OIC members to use forums like United Nations and European Union to explain the western world not to hurt the sentiments of 1.3 billion people under the garb of freedom of expression.\nOn September 27, 2019, the PM addressing the 74th session of the UNGA in New York said the prevalence of Islamophobia had grown at an alarming pace. He concluded by saying that “The Prophet (Muhammad PBUH) lives in our hearts. The holocaust is treated with sensitivity because it gives them pain. That’s all we ask. Don’t use freedom of speech to cause us pain.”\nOn September 25, 2020, PM Imran, in his virtual address to the 75th UN General Assembly session, voiced deep concern over rising ‘Islamophobia’ resulting in attacks against Muslims in many countries and calling it to declare an “International Day to Combat Islamophobia”.\nOn October 26, 2020, the Prime Minister wrote a letter to CEO of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg, referring to a recent decision by Facebook to ban any content that denied or distorted the Holocaust; and called for similar policy to be put in place for anti-Islam comments.\n“Given the rampant abuse and vilification of Muslims on social media platforms, I would ask you to place a similar ban on Islamophobia and hate against Islam for Facebook that you put in Place for Holocaust.”\nOn October 24, 2021, PM Imran addressed the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in New York and asked the UN Secretary-General to convene a global dialogue on countering the “rise of Islamophobia” to save the world from anotherkind of terrorism in the name of the rising phenomenon.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan, on numerous occasions at home and abroad during interview has condemned the west’s anti-Islam bigotry.\nOn June 12, 2021, in an interview to Canadian TV CBC’s chief political correspondent Rosemary Barton, the PM highlighted the need for Western nations to take action against Islamophobia “hate websites,” and Quebec’s religious symbols ban.\nOn June 19, 2021, PM Imran, in an interview to Jonathan Swan of Axios’ on HBO, said Islamophobia started after 9/11 as certain western leaders equated Islam with terrorism. While rejecting the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism,’ the PM said “There is only one Islam”.\nParadoxically, no government or religious political party in the past has taken practical steps to drive the country in the direction of making it a welfare state or establishing the society on the principles of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be Upon Him).\nIn the given environment, it must be accentuated that all religious parties put political biases aside and support the government in its efforts to transform the country on Riyasat-e-Madina Model.",
