They would fail again, he added.\nHe said Maulana Fazlur Rehman had been devoid of any official position in the government for the last three years. In the past, the PDM chief had enjoyed power in almost every government’s tenure.\nAbout the meeting of the opposition parties to the alliance—PDM, he said their gathering bore no fruit. Those who used to say ‘Now and Never’ had failed miserably.",
