  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 23 (APP): Pakistan on Tuesday strongly condemned the arrest of human rights activist Khurram Parvez in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\n“Arbitrary arrests of human rights activists on orchestrated charges by Indian occupation forces is clear evidence of New Delhi’s state-terrorism and trampling of fundamental human rights in IIOJK,” Foreign Office Spokesperson Asim Iftikhar said in a statement issued here.\nThe Spokesperson said that the reprehensible unwarranted searches by Indian National Investigation Agency at the offices and residence of Khuram Parvez, have also been condemned by international human rights activists and organizations.\n“The world is aware that it has become increasingly difficult for human rights organizations and activists to continue their work in India and IIOJK due to incessant witch hunt by the Hindutva driven RSS- BJP combine over unfounded and motivated allegations,” he added.\nAmnesty International had to shut all its operations in India in September 2020 when its bank accounts were frozen by India in an act of reprisal because of their independent reporting on IIOJK, the Spokesperson mentioned.\nHe said the UN human rights machinery, independent NGOs and global media have regularly reported on and expressed concerns over increasing intimidation, harassment and reprisal attacks by Indian occupation forces against Kashmiri human rights defenders, journalists and civil society actors since 5 August 2019.\n“We call on the international community to hold India accountable for continued clamp down against human rights organizations and activists for undertaking their duty to expose gross and systematic human rights violations of Kashmiris in IIOJK, and the minorities, especially Muslims, in India,” the Spokesperson concluded.\nKhurram Parvez is a well acclaimed human rights defender working in the world’s most militarized region – IIOJK.  Parvez is the programme coordinator for a widely respected rights group in the disputed territory, the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS), he is also the chairman of Asian Federation Against Involuntary Disappearances (AFAD).\nIndia’s anti-terrorism investigation agency on November 21 arrested Khurram Parvez in a case of ‘terror funding ‘from the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K) during a raid at his home and office. NIA also confiscated Parvez’s mobile phone, laptop and some books, along with his wife’s cell phone.\nOne of the most prominent rights defenders from Kashmir, Khurram has extensively worked on documenting the abuses committed by Indian security forces as coordinator of Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCCS), a rights group based in Srinagar.\nThe JKCCS has published more than a dozen reports on human rights abuses in Kashmir and its last report, ‘Kashmir’s Internet Siege’ focused on the mass detentions and the reported breakdown of the judicial system in Jammu and Kashmir in the aftermath of the reading down of Article 370.\nA vocal critique of Indian government policies, Khurram, in a rare interview (Turkey’s Anadolu news agency – 2020), had said that since 5th August 2019, the aim of the Indian government’s decision was to “completely disempower and disenfranchise local population,” while terming it as “violation of UN resolutions” on Jammu and Kashmir.\nHe also said, “breaking all commitments and forcing changes in Kashmir through military means would not alter the reality of Kashmir. Israel did all this but the Palestine issue is still alive and more than ever the world is behind Palestinians”.\nWorld Organisation Against Torture (#OMCT) a Global network of over 200 NGOs fighting for\nhuman rights and against torture and Mary Lawlor UN Special Rapporteur HRDs strongly condemned the illegal arrest of HR activist, fearing torture and illegal conviction under draconian terrorism act (UAPA).\nWorld Organisation Against Torture (OMCT), is a Geneva based non-profit which works with groups across the world to fight for human rights stated, “it was deeply concerned” by Khurram’s arrest, “We are deeply concerned about the high risk of torture while in custody. We call for his immediate release”.\nMary Lawlor, UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights Defenders, tweeted “I’m hearing disturbing reports that Khurram Parvez was arrested today in Kashmir & is at risk of being charged by authorities in #India with terrorism-related crimes. He’s not a terrorist, he’s a Human Rights Defender”.\nEarlier, in October 2020, the NIA had conducted raids at Parvez’s home and office.\nKhurram Parvez has always raised his voice against Indian strangulation of people of IIOJK, ‘The Indian Government is Depriving the Kashmiris of Peaceful Means of Protest’.",
