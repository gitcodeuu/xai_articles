While noting that it was encouraging to see the international community constructively engaging with Afghanistan, he also cautioned against the forces that could play the role of ‘spoilers’.\nThe Foreign Secretary underscored the urgent humanitarian and economic challenges in Afghanistan and stressed the need for immediate steps to alleviate the sufferings of the Afghan people. The release of Afghanistan’s financial assets was another step that would be helpful in this regard, he noted.\nThe Foreign Secretary highlighted the steps taken by Pakistan to provide humanitarian assistance, promote bilateral trade and economic cooperation, regulate the cross-border movement of people, foster further coordination among Afghanistan’s neighbours and advance the regional connectivity projects.\nSpecial Representative Daniel Sloper thanked the Government of Pakistan for the assistance extended to Australia and the international community in the evacuation of the diplomatic personnel and others from Afghanistan.
