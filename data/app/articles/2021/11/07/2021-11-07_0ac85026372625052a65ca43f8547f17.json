He expressed complete solidarity with the valiant Kashmiri people.\nHe said OIC had longstanding support for the right of self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.\nThe foreign ministers of OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir extended the support to Kashmiris in a joint communique during a meeting on the sidelines of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly in New York in September this year.\nThe envoy said after his visit to Azad Jammu and Kashmir he would prepare and present a report during the next ministerial meeting of the OIC, on the situation in the region.\nIn the coming days, the OIC envoy will get a first-hand account of the gravity of the situation on the ground in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and along the Line of Control.\nThis was the second visit of the special envoy to Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.Yousef Aldobeay said his first visit to Azad Kashmir last year was beneficial as during it he had the opportunity to meet the Kashmiri leadership.\nGhulam Muhammad Safi, Faiz Nakshbandi, Sheikh Abdul Mateen and Altaf Wani were part of the APHC delegation which met the OIC special envoy.\nThe APHC delegation thanked the special envoy for the OIC’s steadfast support to the people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe delegation apprised the special envoy of the grave human rights and humanitarian situation in the IIOJK. They stressed that following its illegal actions of 5 August 2019, India was now taking steps to disenfranchise the Kashmiri people and to turn the IIOJK into a Hindu dominated territory.\nThe delegation unequivocally rejected these actions and termed them as gross violation of UN Security Council resolutions and international law including the 4th Geneva convention.\nThe Kashmiri delegation affirmed that no amount of suppression by the Indian occupation forces can subdue the resolute spirit of the Kashmiri people to free themselves from the yolk of Indian occupation. They underscored that the valiant Kashmiri struggle will soon be crowned with the glory of success.",
