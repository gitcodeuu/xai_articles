It said the tragedy that has struck the families of innocent civilians killed in the Hyderpora staged encounter is so tormenting that its pain has stunned the people of IIOJK.\nThe statement said, the picture of eighteen month old Inaya, infant daughter of slain Dr Mudasir Gul held by her distraught mother who was sitting on the roads in freezing cold, protesting not for punishment to the killers of her husband,\nbut pleading and begging to the authorities that at least the dead body of her husband be returned to her so that she sees him one last time and gives him a decent burial is agonizing.",
