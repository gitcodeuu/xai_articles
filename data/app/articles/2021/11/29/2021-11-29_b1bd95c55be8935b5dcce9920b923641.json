The ceremony also marked the inauguration of the All Pakistan Women Universities Consortium (APWUC).\nIn his remarks, Shafqat Mahmood highlighted the importance of NAHE efforts for developing and training the future academic leadership in the country. He noted that developing administrative skills in the academic leadership is very crucial as academic excellence does not necessarily mean adeptness in administration and management.\nHe stressed the need for identifying academic administrative talent at an early age so as that this talent could be horned through training and exposure.\nAmid the financial hardships facing the universities, the university heads need to know how to handle finances, he stated while emphasizing on the role of university leadership.\nHe emphasized that the government does not believe in gender discrimination in making appointments and selections. The Minister advised the universities to promote skill-based education, as the future belongs to those who have skills.\nHe emphasized that the universities need to ensure quality and relevance of education. “It is important to have a huge number of universities in the country, however, this should not be at the cost of quality.” In her welcome address,\nExecutive Director Higher Education Commission (HEC) Dr. Shaista Sohail underscored that women have a great role in the national uplift. “We need to utilize their talent and acknowledge their stake in the country’s progress,” she stated.\nShe noted that leaders are not born, but a person can become a leader through struggle, determination, will-power and vision. Shedding light on the Women Leadership Programme, the Executive Director said that capacity building of women in leadership roles is one of the ways to give equal opportunities to women.\nShe remarked that equity, diversity and inclusivity in any sector play a central role in its progress. On this occasion, Vice Chancellor Fatima Jinnah Women University Dr. Saima Hamid shared the objectives of APWUC in terms of increasing the role of Pakistani women in the socio-economic development of Pakistan in line with the global priorities. She regretted that Pakistan lags far behind other nations in the Global Gender Gap Index.\nThe APWUC, she said, will provide the women playing a leadership role in academia to come together to overcome the challenges in the way of women empowerment.\nCountry Director British Council Pakistan Mr. Amir Ramzan highlighted that there are a number of factors which have kept the women across South Asia away from leadership roles.\nHe held out assurance that the British Council will stand by NAHE and APWUC in their efforts to equip and empower women.
