  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain on Saturday said the unilateral actions of Sindh Government contrary to the directives of National Command and Control Centre (NCOC) and Federal Government would cause immense damage to the national economy.\nThe people were concerned over the provincial government’s decisions (particularly\nimposition of the total lockdown in Karachi to curb the rising Covid cases amid the fourth wave of the pandemic), he said in a video statement.\nکورونا کی صورتحال میں سندھ حکومت کے فیصلوں سے تشویش کی لہر دوڑ گئی ہے۔ سندھ حکومت کے NCOC اور وفاقی حکومت کی ہدایات کے برخلاف اقدامات پاکستان کی معیشت کیلئے بے پناہ نقصان کا باعث بنیں گے۔ سندھ حکومت نے کورونا SOPs پر عمل درآمد کیا ہوتا تو آج یہ صورتحال نہ ہوتی۔@fawadchaudhry pic.twitter.com/rcYxcVc4S2\n— Fawad Chaudhry (Updates) (@FawadPTIUpdates) July 31, 2021\nFawad said Pakistan successfully fought the first three waves of the pandemic with the strategy (to save the lives and livelihoods) and that could not be changed.\nThe closure of industry in Sindh, he said, would harm the economy and create employment problems. The industries whose 100 per cent workforce was vaccinated, should be reopened.\nThe minister opined the way the Sindh government was imposing sanctions would only add to the hardships of common people in the province.\nHe said under Articles 149 and 151 of the Constitution, and the Supreme Court’s decision,\nthe provincial governments could not take unilateral decisions, rather they were bound to implement the Federal Government’s guidelines and the NCOC’s strategy.\nThe Sindh Government, therefore, should immediately open industries, and not pressurize traders and daily wage earners, he added.\nThe minister regretted that had the Sindh government implemented the standard operating procedures (SOPs) related to the coronavirus, the province would not have been facing the present situation.\nThe Federation, he said, was cooperating with the provincial governments to curb the pandemic.\nFawad said the fourth wave of coronavirus started from India, where the Narendra Modi government unfortunately did not take steps required to control its outbreak.\n” Today, India has become a source of spreading Delta virus in the entire region,” he asserted.\nThe world economies were just recovering from the coronavirus successfully, they again came under stress due to the irresponsible policies of Indian government, the minister added.",
