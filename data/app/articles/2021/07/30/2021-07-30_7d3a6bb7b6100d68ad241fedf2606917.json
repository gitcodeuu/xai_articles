Google has also surfaced the latest updates and health advice from Pakistani health authorities across Search, Maps and YouTube in Urdu and English.\nAnd during Ramadan in 2020 and 2021, the company supported a PTV live stream broadcast of Tarawih prayers on YouTube, facilitating observance of an important religious event with enhanced public health and safety measures.",
