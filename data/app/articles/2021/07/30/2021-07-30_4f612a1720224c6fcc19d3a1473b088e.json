To serve patients in need, a facilitation desk has also been established at the HFH to identify the eligible beneficiaries for Tahafuz.\nEhsaas Tahafuz is Pakistan’s first shock-oriented safety net programme. Currently, it is fully operational in HFH, Rawalpindi.\nThe scale and scope of the programme is being upscaled based on lessons of the recently concluded pilot with HFH.\nEhsaas Tahafuz will work with public hospitals to identify patients facing catastrophic health expenditures, who will then be assessed by the system, and if eligible, will be provided funding by allocating donations to the patient.\nAccording to its predefined scope, Ehsaas Tahafuz caters to patients facing catastrophic health expenditures, who are not covered by Sehat Sahulat Card or are in hospital not registered with Sehat Sahulat programme.\nOnce fully operationalized nationwide, Ehsaas Tahafuz will set up a one window paperless and web-based precision safety net.\nIt will also have funders’ empowerment features in terms of micro transaction alerts, and personalized login credentials for detailed web-viewing right down to the micro-transaction level.",
