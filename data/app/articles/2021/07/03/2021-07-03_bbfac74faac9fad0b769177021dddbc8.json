  "content": "KARACHI, Jul 03 (APP): Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Political Communication, Shahbaz Gill, has said that the people who were responsible of energy crisis in the country were raising questions only for political point scoring.\nResponding to statement of PML-N leader Shahbaz Sharif here on Saturday, SAPM said that in the first four years of PML-N’s inefficient government nation had to bear 12 hour long loadshedding while they brokered agreements of the costliest electricity for the sake of commissions and kick-backs.\nNow Shahbaz Sharif was trying to get political advantage of the situation which arisen due to inefficiency of his party, he said.\nAnticipating significant improvement in supply of electricity and gas till Monday, Shahbaz Gill said that dry docking of a RLNG terminal resulted in reduced generation by some power plants while demand of electricity increased due to revival of industry.\nRLNG supply was expected to be resumed till Monday and it would improve the power generation while Tarbela Dam would soon resume producing electricity as per its generation capacity, he said.\nGeneration projects having 26000 mega watt capacity would be completed in coming 8 years, Gill maintained adding that PTI government was all set to add 10,000 megawatt in transmission at the earliest.\nShahbaz Gill said that in 2018 volume of circular debt of power sector was increasing to the tune of Rs.450 billion every month but now due to prudent and efficient policies of PTI government it was curtailed to Rs 177 billion.",
