  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhary Fawad Hussain on Saturday asked the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) to share details of Nawaz Sharif’s meeting with Afghan National Security Advisor Hamdullah Mohib with the nation. \tThe PML-N must share the audio transcript of the meeting, he said while addressing a press conference here along with Advisor to the Prime Minister on Accountability and Interior Shahzad Akbar.\tThe minister said after meeting with Nawaz, the anti-Pakistan Afghan official also met  Indian secret agency personnel.       Fawad questioned the PML-N leader who remained prime minister thrice, should hold meetings with anti Pakistan foreign officials/nationals. Whether he had taken his party members in confidence or informed its Central Executive Committee about the meeting.\tHe said Nawaz Sharif was a fugitive and was living in the apartments which he had purchased through looted public money.\tHe said Prime Minister Imran Khan neither held secret meetings with anyone nor gave statements against national institutions.\tHe said Hamdullah Mohib had off and on expressed his hatred and used derogatory language against Pakistan. Pakistan had disconnected all its contacts with the Afghan advisor’s office and made it clear to the Afghan leadership that there would be no talks with Hammaullah Mohib, he added.        The minister said families of Afghan officials Hamdullah Mohib and Amrullah Saleh were living abroad and they had nothing on stake as they were on some special mission.\t   Amrullah  Saleh and other people like him should have a retrospect as to why they could not bring stability in their country despite remaining in power for 20 years, he added.\tHe said Pakistan always supported Afghanistan in hour of need and hosted over five million Afghan refugees for many years.\tHe said more than 6000 Afghan students were getting education in Pakistan and thousands of Afghan nationals were getting medical treatment in its hospitals. “We provided them an opportunity so they can lead successful lives,” he added. \tHe said Pakistan was committed for durable peace in Afghanistan.\tFawad said Prime Minister Imran Khan had also made it clear that Pakistan had no favourite Afghan group as it was with the whole Afghan nation.\tFawad said that currently Pakistan was facing conspiracies from India which used the soil of neighbouring country on its western border for subversive activities in Pakistan.\tPakistan, he said, always desired to have good relations with India but unfortunately extremist elements (RSS) were in power there.\tResponding to a question, the minister said Prime Minister Imran Khan being the ambassador of Kashmir had effectively pleaded case of Kashmiri people at all international fora.       He said Pakistan had persistent stance that the Kashmiri people should decide their fate as per their aspirations under the United Nations resolutions.\\9327/24/2021 10:09:39 PM\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
