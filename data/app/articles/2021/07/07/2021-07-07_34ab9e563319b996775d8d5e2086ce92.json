The United States stood at 20th in the ranking.\nThe Economist’s ‘normalcy index’ focuses on how better the countries are returning to their pre-pandemic levels, by grading each country using eight indicators: Time not at home, retail, office use, public transport, road traffic, flights, cinema, and sports attendance.\nAccording to the report, a rise was witnessed in global normalcy during March 2020 due to several countries imposing lockdowns.\nWith 100 set as the pre-pandemic level of activity, Pakistan ranked third with 84.4 out of 100. While Hong Kong topped the list with a ranking of 96.3 while New Zealand was ranked in second with 87.8.\nIn the category of ‘office use’, ‘retail’, ‘public transport’ and ‘time not spent at home, Pakistan ranked over 100. However, the categories of  ‘cinema’ and ‘flights’ witness a low score.",
