Average temperatures have already risen by almost 0.37°C since 1980.\nThe Climate Risk Index places Pakistan in 5th place in terms of vulnerability to climate risk. The frequency of extreme climatic events is increasing, including droughts and floods with severe impact on climate-sensitive livelihoods.\nThe Global Hunger Index ranks Pakistan on 88th place indicating serious hunger levels. Thirty-seven percent of the population is estimated to be food insecure.\nThe short-term causes of malnutrition lie in extreme weather events and or socio-economic household conditions, long-term causes are more likely to be structural as well as challenges within the global, national, and local food systems also caused by climate change exacerbating the poor nutritional status of vulnerable populations\nIn Sindh, the effects of climate change are particularly visible through extreme weather events.  The arid region of the Thar desert is affected by recurring and persistent drought in the last five years besides flood and locust infestation impacting agriculture production, livelihoods, and the ecosystem.\nThe PARC, WHH and TRDP are working in the Thar region to promote climate-smart agriculture and resilience towards food and nutrition security of smallholder farmers.\nThe joint project engages local communities, academia, agriculture extension departments and policy makers in the adaptation of climate-smart agriculture practices through direct support to most vulnerable communities.",
