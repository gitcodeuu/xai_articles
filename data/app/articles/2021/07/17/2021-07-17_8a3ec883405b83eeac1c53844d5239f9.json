  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):The news of Reuters photojournalist and Pulitzer prize winner Danish Siddiqui’s death drew strange reactions from right wing extremists on social media. During the second wave of Covid-19, Siddiqui had photographed a funeral ground where mass cremations were taking place.\nThese photographs showed the scale of the pandemic and grieving family members. Soon after, he was trolled viciously, with right wing extremists saying the snaps showed India in a poor light, Kashmir Media Service reported.\nUsing expletives, right wing extremist said Danish took photos of Hindu cremations at the peak of 2nd wave of COVID-19 and splashed them across foreign media to not only demean India but also to degrade Hinduism.\nBut probably all these Hindu extremists forgot was that Danish Siddiqui being a thorough professional showed to the world the real picture of the pandemic in India.\nCelebrating the pictures Siddiqui took, Amber Ajay Tiwari wrote: “He told stories through his pictures. He fought for the oppressed with his lens. What a great photojournalist he was.”",
