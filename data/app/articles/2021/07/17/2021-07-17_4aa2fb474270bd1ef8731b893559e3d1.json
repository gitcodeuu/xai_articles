  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP):Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib on Saturday said the federal government had reduced petroleum levy on petrol to zero to lessen burden of rising global prices of the commodity on consumers.\nIn a tweet, he said the government had brought down sales tax on petrol from Rs 15. 9 to Rs 11. 5, reducing Rs 4.4 per liter on the commodity.\nHe said the incumbent government was facing loss in its revenue collection by reducing taxes on petrol.\nOn the contrary, he said former finance minister during the tenure of Pakistan Muslim Leagure -Nawaz, Ishaq Dar had used to impose burden of global prices of petroleum products directly on the consumers.\nFarrukh said the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) during its tenure had never reduced or cut petroleum levy or sale tax on petroleum products.\nHe chided PML-N leader Ahsan Iqbal for misleading public that the government had not increased petroleum prices in view of international market but to put extra burden of taxes on the people.",
