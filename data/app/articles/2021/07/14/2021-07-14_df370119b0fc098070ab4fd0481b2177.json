The living standards of the people of Kashmir had deteriorated instead of improving, he said.\nThe people had announced their decision in 2018 by electing Imran Khan, Shahbaz Gill added.\nThe majority of Kashmir’s population is overseas Pakistanis, he said adding, the overseas Pakistanis helped Pakistan’s economy by sending historic remittances.\nThe Pakistanis living around the globe by sending $29.4 billion gave decision in favor of Imran Khan, he said and added, the economy stood on its feet during Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) regime.\n90 per cent increase in the vehicles’ sales is an indication of improved living standards of the people of the country, he said adding, large scale manufacturing growth of 14.57% is a sign of improvement in the economy.",
