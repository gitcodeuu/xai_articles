He expressed the hope that next year PTV will not take license fees being charged now.\nDuring the last two years, the performance of the department has improved and present government would make PTV a profitable organization.\nIn a written reply, the minister said that government has not allocated Rs. 200 billion for project, however, in 2018 a Public Sector Development Programme funded project titled as “modernization of camera and production equipment of PTVC” was approved with an estimated cost of Rs. 555.59 million, adding that project was successfully being executed by procuring equipment on competitive bid basis and establishment of letter of Credit (L/C).",
