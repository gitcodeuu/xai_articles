  "content": "LAHORE, Jul 23 (APP):Governor Punjab Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar has said that the blame game against Pakistan is an alibi for the Afghan government to hide its failures in establishing peace in the country.\n“Afghan Vice President Amrullah’s negative propaganda against Pakistan is a conspiracy against peace in the region”, he said while talking to the media men after offering Eidul Azha prayers at the Badshahi Mosque, adding that Pakistan supports the Afghan people and their popular voice.\nProvincial Minister for Excise Hafiz Mumtaz Ahmed, and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) MNA Faizullah Kamoka also called on Governor Punjab Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar on the day.\nGovernor Punjab Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said Pakistan had sacrificed more than 70,000 lives in the war against terrorism for establishment of peace in the region, adding that even today Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, is playing its role for the Afghan peace process with sincerity.\nHe said, in these circumstances, Afghan government officials’ criticism on Pakistan Government for covering up their failures is a vicious act that deserves condemnation.\nSarwar called upon the Afghan government to set its own house right instead of pointing fingers at others so that peace can prevail in the region.\nReplying to a question, Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said Pakistan would be the biggest beneficiary of peace in Afghanistan and peace is most needed for development and prosperity in the region.\nHe said the United States and its allies should fulfill their responsibilities for peace and thwart the intentions of those who are conspiring against the peace. He said that the deteriorating situation in Afghanistan will not only affect Afghanistan but the entire region.\nThe Governor Punjab also condemned the worst atrocities against the Kashmiris and the massacre of Kashmiri youth at the hands of Indian forces on the eve of Eid in Kashmir and said that Indian forces under the leadership of Narendra Modi are committing the worst acts of terrorism in Kashmir, adding that the Kashmiris are also being deprived of their religious freedom.\n“We demand that all international bodies, including the United Nations and the OIC, should take notice of the atrocities being committed against the Kashmiris and that India be compelled through diplomatic pressure to stop these atrocities and give Kashmiris their right to freedom,” he said.",
