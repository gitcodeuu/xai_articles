People like Ahsan Iqbal and Saad Rafiq know that exams have already happened in Baluchistan and Sindh, therefore other students cannot be treated differently 1/2\n— Shafqat Mahmood (@Shafqat_Mahmood) July 9, 2021\n“They know that decision to take exams was taken unanimously by all federating units including PML-N Govt in AJK, and PPP in Sindh”. They knew that students could not be promoted on the basis of previous exams as there were no exams last year, he mentioned.\nSaad Rafiq and Ahsan Iqbal should know that for educating people, exams are the best measure to evaluate students ability, adding, class 12 is much important as the students have to go to universities and professional colleges on the basis of HSSC results, Shafqat Mahmood added.\nSaad Rafiq/Ahsan Iqbal should know if they claim to be educated that exams are the best measure of students ability and class 12 important as they have to go to universities and professional colleges. Why should hardworking students be discriminated against. Stop cheap politics\nHe stressed that why should hardworking students be discriminated and asked PML-N leaders to stop cheap politics.\nHe went on saying that both PML-N leaders should know that after 18th amendment, out of 30 educational boards, only one board, the federal board is under the federal government.\nYet they were pretending that one order from federal minister could stop exams across the country.\nHe said, PML-N leaders have attempted again a failed attempt at cheap politics.\nThey know that decision to take exams was taken unanimously by all federating units including N govt in AJK, and PPP in Sindh. They know that students cannot be promoted on the basis of previous exams as there were no exams last year. 2/3\nShafqat Mahmood said exams were starting from Saturday in the remaining provinces and federating units. He also wished all students who would appear in exams good luck.\nWhile offering an opportunity to those students who wanted more time for preparations, he said they could avail the chance of appearing in supplementary exams that would be taken after two to three months by all boards.\n“Why should these exams be postponed and students who have been studying be penalised”, he questioned PML-N.",
