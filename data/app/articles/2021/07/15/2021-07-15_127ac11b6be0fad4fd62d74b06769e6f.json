  "content": "The images of piles of Pakistani currency being counted by an Afghan national, on social media platforms have sent ripples across the country, as it confirmed earlier reports that the huge cash found in the area next to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, was meant for subversive activities.\nAlmost three billion rupees were found stacked in a compound of an Afghan NDS colonel situated at the back of the Indian consulate in Kandahar which was hurriedly evacuated by India, which despatched a number of its Air Force C17 aircraft to airlift its staff.\nThe discovery of the huge cache has exposed, what Pakistan has been claiming all along that the Indian Consulates were being used to funnel and fund terrorist activities deep inside Pakistan. Pakistan said 66 training camps were being run by the Indian intelligence in a press conference jointly addressed by Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Director General ISPR Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar, in November 2020.\nA security source told APP that the money was being used to fund terrorist organizations like Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan – TTP, Jamiat Ul Ahrar – JuA and  Harakat Ul Ansar HuA linked with the notorious Indian RAW.\nThe huge quantity of Pakistani currency, which otherwise had no purpose in Afghanistan, was also used for funding sub-nationalist groups to undertake sabotage activities and target national cohesion and unity inside Pakistan.\nAccording to the information available the money was being used to purchase arms and ammunition for the TTP and other foreign-funded terrorist groups for target killings, IED and VBIED blasts, and funding of activity to create sectarian unrest in the country.\nPakistan through a dossier shared with the international organizations had given solid proof that the Indian Consulates inside Afghanistan were the prime source of funding and patronizing of terrorists with a proven nexus with the Aghan NDS.\nPakistan’s “Indian Dossier” clearly mentioned the names of Indian diplomats and RAW officials involved in financing and supporting terrorism inside Pakistan.\nHere’s the question for all the #Afghan leadership accusing #Pakistan of supporting the #Taliban.\nWhy did Afghan intelligence have so much #Pakistani currency in their posts?\nWe believe that it was being used to sponsor #terrorism & #insurgencies on our side of the border. pic.twitter.com/wkNEX1Sfbr\n— CommandEleven®  (@commandeleven) July 14, 2021\nThe security source said that in addition to the money, TTP and other terrorists were also being provided ammunition under the Indo-NDS nexus. This was further proved during the recent evacuation exercise conducted by the Indian Air Force C17s that brought four tonnes of ammunition for the Afghan National Army and took off from Kabul with diplomats, military, and intelligence officials.\nOver the years both the RAW and the NDS have been hands in gloves to sabotage peace and stability in Pakistan, however, the world was yet to take note of this activity.\nAs Taliban take out Afg army check posts on Pak Afg border,Chaman,they have found estimated Pak Rs 3 B believed to have been used as bribes to Afg army by smugglers,same cash was then used by Afg army,NDS & RAW to payoff terrorists to carry out attacks against Pakistani interests pic.twitter.com/w01yCg8e3b\n— SHAFAAT SHAH (@INFANTRY28) July 14, 2021\nActivists on social media said it was now time that India be put on a terror-financing watch list and the international community must not turn a blind eye to such activities by the RAW and the NDS. #IndiaSpoilerOfPeace was one of the top trends on the microblogging site in which the Twitterati lashed out at the nexus which they said was not only a threat to Pakistan but to the entire region as well.\nThe security official said Pakistan was keeping a close eye on the evolving situation and also investigating that how the currency was being used against Pakistan.",
