  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 15 (APP): In the interest of general public, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday approved an increase in price of petrol by Rs 5.40 per litre, rejecting the summary of Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA) that had recommended the price fixation at Rs 11.40.\nThe financial burden arising out of the difference of Rs 6 per litre will be borne by the government itself, the PM Office said.\nIn view of the rising prices of petroleum products in the global market for last several months, the OGRA had recommended an increase in the price of petrol up to Rs 11.40 per liter.\nHowever, the prime minister took the decision in view of providing relief to the consumers and general public, the PM Office said.\nThe price of diesel has been fixed at Rs 2.54 per litre, kerosene at Rs 1.39 per litre and light diesel at Rs 1.27 per litre.",
