  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 12 (APP): Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) President Mehbooba Mufti has said that New Delhi has put the resources of the territory on sale and has brought its economy on the brink of collapse.\nAccording to Kashmir Media Service, Mehbooba Mufti, while interacting with PDP delegations from the Chenab Valley said, “From power projects to the sand mining sector, everything is being auctioned by the present dispensation under a planned conspiracy to smash our economy to smithereens”.\nShe added that this administrative onslaught has already shown its impact. “While curfews and lockdowns have caused serious dent to the economy, a series of administrative orders and laws have come as a shock,” she said.\nThe Chenab Valley, she said, is facing the worst impact of the sell-out by Indian government as even the power projects which Jammu and Kashmir was capable of undertaking itself has now been handed over to Indian company, NHPC.\nThe Ratle power project is an example where the state-owned Power Development Corporation was self-sufficient to undertake the project but it was handed over to the joint consortium that too by minimizing the share of JKPDC, she added.\nShe said power project construction companies were working like the East India company ignoring the rights of the local population. Locals are being denied employment in these projects, she deplored.\nMehbooba said that local contractors were getting peanuts for the works they were executing while labourers were being denied benefits prescribed under the laws.",
