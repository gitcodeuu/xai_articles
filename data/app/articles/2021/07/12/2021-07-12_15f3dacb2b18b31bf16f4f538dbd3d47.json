  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 12 (APP): Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib on Monday said Chief Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Nawaz Sharif had become ‘Altaf Hussain II’ (banned MQM-London founder) for saving his money amassed through corrupt practices.\nIn a tweet, he said Nawaz Sharif narrative’s mainstay was to plunder national wealth after coming into the power, whereas corruption and money laundering were their (Sharif family) identity.\nHe regarded PML-N Vice President Maryam Safdar as a ‘certified liar’ and said there was no difference between narrative of her father Nawaz Sharif and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nمریم صفدر کے ابو نواز شریف  اور  مودی کے بیانیہ میں کوئی فرق نہیں ہے۔ بھارتی جاسوس کلبھوشن یادو کے پکڑے جانے پر انکی زبان بند ہوتی ہےمودی کے حلف پر جاتے ہے تو مودی کو خوش کرنے کے لئے کشمیری حریت لیڈرز کو نہیں ملتے ہے اور بھارتی اداکاروں کو ملتے ہے\n— Farrukh Habib (@FarrukhHabibISF) July 12, 2021\nKulbhushan Jadhav’s arrest in Pakistan was enough to hush them up, he added.\nTo appease Modi, he said Nawaz Sharif, being Prime Minister of Pakistan, abstained from meeting the Kashmiri Huriyat leaders when he went India to attend his oath taking ceremony, and preferred to have an audience with Indian Bollywood actors.",
