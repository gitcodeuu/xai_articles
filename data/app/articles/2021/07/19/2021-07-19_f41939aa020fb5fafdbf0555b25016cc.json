  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 19 (APP): Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Sahibzada Noor-ul-Haq Qadri on Monday said that the impending political change in Muzaffarabad would ultimately become the base of change in Srinagar, which will shake New Delhi.\nAddressing PTI’s Ulema and Mashaikh Conference, he said India can not suppress the Kashmiris for long. The peoples of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) had already announced their decision to vote for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) candidates in the upcoming elections.\nHe said Ulema and Mashaikh of PTI were gearing up for campaigning in Azad Kashmir elections and let the scholars and elders stand where the truth was.\nHe urged Ulema to work for the righteous and disseminate the message of PTI at every nook and corner of AJK.\nCriticising opposition, he said they have started clamoring about rigging even before the elections. The whole world knew as a cricketer but Ulema knew him as a servant of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).\nMinister said he supports Prime Minister Imran Khan as he wanted to steer the country towards progress and prosperity. Ulema should help Imran Khan in his bid to transform the country into Madina State.\nHe said PM Imran Khan’s stance was clear that Pakistan would never recognize Israel. Some Muslim countries were confused regarding recognizing Israel but the clear stance of Imran had forced them not to recognize Israel.\nHe criticized former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif for sending the gifts of ‘Sarris’ to the mother of Indian Prime Minister Narendera Modi.\nEarlier, in a unanimous resolution Ulema and Mashaik convention lauded the efforts of Prime Minister Imran Khan for raising Kashmir issue at international level. Ulema also praised the prime minister for refusing to restore trade with India until the pre-August 5, 2019 status of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir is restored.\nThe convention also lauded the narrative of premier regarding Islamophobia at Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), prompting the OIC to adopt a Pakistan’s resolution in its meeting held on November 28, 2020.\nThe resolution lauded Prime Minister Imran Khan for impeding the exhibition of caricatures in Holland. Convention felicitated economic achievements of the government, reduction in trade deficit and increase in foreign investment. Ulema vowed promoting the narrative of Paigham-e-Pakistan, harmony and assured their support for promoting peace and harmony in the country.\nThe convention vowed gearing up their efforts for the success of PTI candidates in the upcoming AJK elections. The convention prayed Allah Almighty to rest the departed souls of Pakistan Army and other security forces Shuda in eternal peace.",
