We fear that Indian [Delta] variant is coming. I appeal the nation to use face masks, which is an easiest way, and take protective measures, we can protect ourselves from the fourth wave of COVID-19,” Imran Khan said in his remarks telecast live.\nThe Prime Minister, who chaired a meeting to review the coronavirus situation in the country, said that with the spread of different variants of COVID-19 including the Indian [Delta] variant due to constant mutation of coronavirus, the situation in various countries including Bangladesh, Afghanistan, Indonesia was worsening.\nHe also stressed that masses, particularly those living in cities, should get them vaccinated as early as possible, adding, that ample doses of the corona vaccine were available in the country and would be coming more.\nThe Prime Minister said that Pakistan with the grace of Almighty Allah has so far been fortunate in tackling the situation of COVID-19 pandemic due to efforts of the government as well as the cooperation of masses.\nHe in that respect also referred to a report of the Economist which put Pakistan at number three in the list of countries that took better measures to tackle the pandemic situation.\nThe Prime Minister also appreciated the efforts made by the National Command and Control Center (NCOC) to deal with the situation of COVID-19 pandemic.\nHe further said that following the protective measures including the use of face masks were also essential to protect the country’s economy as well as people which could be affected due to lockdown and closures of businesses, marriage halls, restaurants, transport etc.\nHe said that the government wanted the country’s wheels of economy running and did not want to go for lockdown due to coronavirus, which had enhanced the poverty level across the world.\nThe Prime Minister further urged the masses to take protective measures including the use face masks on the occasion of upcoming Eid-ul-Azha, which could cause rise in coronavirus cases.\nImran Khan, while appreciating the role of Districts Administrations in ensuring the enforcement of COVID-19 Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) during the previous waves of coronavirus urged them to fulfill their responsibility of ensuring the use of face masks by people at public places.\nStressing for vaccination of maximum people, the Prime Minister said, since Pakistan, unlike the US and UK, was not a COVID-19 vaccine producing country, it was importing the vaccine and complete vaccination of people will take time.\nHe said that with Pakistan having successfully tackled the previous waves, the country could again be saved from the negative effectives of COVID-19 through the cooperation of masses coupled with government’s efforts and measures.",
