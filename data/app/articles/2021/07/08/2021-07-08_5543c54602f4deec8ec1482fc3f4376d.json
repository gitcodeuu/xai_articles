Its global nature means that it would be opened to any country around the world, hence opening the doors of learning to everyone, strengthening ongoing exchanges, and connecting countries facing similar quandaries.\nGovernments would be at the center of the initiative and would be given the opportunity to directly tap knowledge and tap expertise in other fellow countries, from frontline responders to higher-level policymakers”, Dr. Sania said.\nShe added, “We are learning so much from the crises, and we have gone so far in responding. Let’s now turn the tide and build on this learning: let’s translate today’s response into a knowledge investment for tomorrow. If history is of any lesson, the best response is preparedness”.\nAmbassador Akram highlighted the importance of Social Protection, globally. In his keynote remarks, the Under Secretary General of UNDESA also alluded to the challenges and livelihoods lost as a result of the pandemic and the importance of global experience sharing.\nDuring the panel discussion, Michal Rutkowski, Lead of Global Social Protection at the World Bank said, “I salute the initiative of Nishtar; there is no better time to develop a network and to create an instant repository of knowledge which facilitates exchange of accurate knowledge”. He said, further adding, “Every adversity is an opportunity.” Sabina Alkire from Oxford University and Alexandar Pick also addressed the event.\nDr. Sania Nishtar also said in her keynote address another HPLF session titled on “SDGs in focus, Goal 1,2,8 and 17″).\nThe session was part of the high-level political forum (HLPF) on sustainable development which is the core United Nations platform for follow-up and review of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\nThe meeting of the HLPF 2021 is taking place from 6 July to 15 July 2021 under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council.\nIn the session, other speakers included ECOSOC Vice President, Collin Vexin Kelapile, Permanent Representative of Botswana; ASG Maria Francesca Spatolisano of DESA; Yongyi\nMin, Chief, SDG Monitoring Section, UNDESA/Statistics Division; Gerda Verburg, Coordinator at Scaling-Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement; Guy Rider, DG of ILO; Aloysius Ordu, Head, Africa Growth Initiative Brookings Institution; Olivier De Schutter, UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights; Meryame Kitir, Belgian Minister for Development Cooperation; Silvana Eugenia Vargas Winstanley, Minister of Development and Social Inclusion, Peru; Gilbert F.
