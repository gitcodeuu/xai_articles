He said that Kashmiri youth should use modern tools of social media to spread imagery and stories of Indian oppression in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\n“India wants to gag Kashmiri media so as no tales of Kashmiri sufferings and imagery would not come out of Jammu and Kashmir. Youth should act as bloggers, vlogers, social media activists and expose brutal face of India in Jammu and Kashmir to the world,” he said.\nShehryar Afridi said that civil, military leadership and all political parties stand united on the issue of Kashmir and all stand together to reassure their Kashmiri brethren that Pakistan stands by them in their quest for freedom.",
