  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 13 (APP):Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib Tuesday said the people of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) had not given response to Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari during the election campaign.\nTalking to a private news channel, he said the PPP chairman had no credibility and contribution in the politics that was why he was not popular among the masses and totally failed in getting sympathies of them.\nHe said the people of the country were asking from Bilawal Bhutto that why he went to United States (US) as elections were scheduled in the AJK, who might have fear of defeat in the polls.\nIt was contradictory that Bilawal had preferred to Gilgit-Baltistan (GB) general election in the past rather than the public gatherings of Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), he added.\nFarrukh Habib said the PPP leadership was not in position or unable to tell the nation regarding its chairman agenda of visit to US.\nHe said leadership of both political parties including PPP and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz were involved in massive corruption and money laundering, adding they had registered corruption cases against each others during their regimes.\nHe lamented that both PPP and PML-N had not strengthened the accountability process in the country while the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) would not make any compromise in that regard.\nReplying to a question, he said Pakistan had taken clear stance that it would not give its bases to US against Afghanistan.\nNobody would be allowed to use Pakistan’s soil for subversive activities against other countries, he added.",
