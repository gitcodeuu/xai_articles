Pakistan, in his view, is full of talent that should be nurtured and encouraged through better opportunities.\nProblems such as brain drain, bureaucratic hurdles, and restricted import of tech-based goods and technologies should be addressed. He also pointed out the responsibility of the global north for development of tech- and R&D-based human resources to ensure collective gains.\nDr Malcolm Parry OBE, pointed out that in terms of capacity, the global population of university graduates was expected to nearly double over this decade and reach 300 million by 2030.\nThe levels of global investment in R&D tripled from $676 billion in 2000 to $2.0 trillion in 2018. Although the government is a major funder of research in many countries, it tends to be a minor performer in undertaking research.\nHe said national and international policy decisions sit at the heart of the win-win model for science and technology.\nOutputs of the process can be anyways translated into commercial success by stimulating and supporting entrepreneurship among young people that pass through universities and help them create or find worthwhile employment by connecting science that includes Engineering, Technology, and Social Science, to a market.\nHe said that the role for scientific knowledge translators – including policymakers, analysts, engineers, business entrepreneurs, and sometimes scientists themselves – was crucial if their advances were to improve welfare.\nThis needs to be supported with policies that encourage investment and help drive technology entrepreneurship.",
