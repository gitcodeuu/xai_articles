Revd Bishop Dr..NadeemBhinder, Saleem Khokhar (Ex-MPA), QamarRafiq, and Tahier Solomon.\nDr. Shera added that EU Disinformation Lab report that uncovered 15 years long Indian based operations to discredit Pakistan,was criminal act. He condemned the attempts to discredit their beloved country.\nThe report was issued by a Brussels based NGO, dedicated to combating disinformation against various countries.\nMeanwhile, in another statement, which was also endorsed by other UK Pakistani Christian leaders, Dr. James Shera appreciated a new report: “Destructive Lives”, commissioned by the charity Open Doors, and independently prepared by researchers from the London School of Economics and Political Science.\nHe condemned disinformation and speeches that incite violence and discrimination against religious minorities in India, in the report.\nDr Shera said, “The report is based on comprehensive investigations and discussions with Christians and Muslims across India. It paints a deeply troubling picture: a methodical campaign of violent persecution, disregarded or even encouraged by members of police, judiciary, media and even many politicians.”\n“We call for action by international human rights organizations, United Nations, governments, financial institutions and social media companies, including the convening of an international fact-finding commission on violence and human rights violations against religious minorities in India,” he added.",
