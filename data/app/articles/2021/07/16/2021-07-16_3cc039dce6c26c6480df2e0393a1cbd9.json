In an earlier tweet, the Prime Minister had pointed that the “RSS ideology of Hindu supremacy, like the Nazi Aryan Supremacy, will not stop in IOK; instead, it will lead to suppression of Muslims in India & eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan. The Hindu Supremacists version of Hitler’s Lebensraum.”\nI am afraid this RSS ideology of Hindu Supremacy, like the Nazi Aryan Supremacy, will not stop in IOK; instead it will lead to suppression of Muslims in India & eventually lead to targeting of Pakistan. The Hindu Supremacists version of Hitler's Lebensraum.\n— Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) August 11, 2019\nThe Prime Minister’s two-year-old tweet stands true to the day as the extremist Hindu policies have made the lives of non-Hindus unbearable under the government of the RSS backed BJP government of Narendra Modi.\nReports from the UN bodies, the United States State Department’s Country Report on Human Rights violations, Reports of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and several other organisations speak volumes about how the extremist, hardline policies of India, which were a threat to regional peace and stability.",
