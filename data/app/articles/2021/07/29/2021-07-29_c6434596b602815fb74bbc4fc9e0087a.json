  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 29 (APP): Councillor Dr James Shera, former Mayor of Rugby, has expressed his deep concern over the human rights issues reported during a recent House of Lords debate about the treatment of minorities in India.\n“The House of Lords Members discussed reports of persecution of minorities and intimidation of civil society members in India, conveyed deep worries and urged Her Majesty’s government to broach the issues of violation of human rights and persecution of minorities in India,” Dr. Shera said in a press release issued on Thursday.\nHe added, “On one hand it was heartening to see that a number of noble members called India to account while some unfortunately tried to condone the condemnable acts and policies of Prime Minister Modi’s government, that is using all means to impose Hindutva ideology in blatant violation of human rights conventions, international laws and the U.N charter”.\nThis statement was endorsed by the UK Pakistani Christian leaders including: Dr Peter David, Advocate Qamar Shams, Mr. Michael Massey, Ex MPA Saleem Khokhar, and Mr.Tahier Solomon, Dr. Shera maintained.",
