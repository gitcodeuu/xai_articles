Citing the examples of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal, he said, the nation needed to follow the footprints of these two great progressive leaders to make Pakistan a great country among the comity of nations. Prime Minister Imran Khan was following their vision to achieve this goal, he added.\nThe minister said Pakistan was affected by Afghan situation since many decades.When super powers invaded Afghanistan they did not consult Pakistan but it had to suffer from the consequences of those decisions.\nHe said that Pakistan wanted a peaceful inclusive dispensation in Kabul which should have support of all Afghan factions and the general public. Pakistan was doing its best for the success of Intra- Afghan-talks as it facilitated the meetings between their different factions, he remarked.\nFawad said the recent victories of the Taliban had raised the question that what was the outcome of the US $ 2,000 billions invested by the United States in Afghanistan. He said a vast majority of Afghanistan politicians and army officials have built their properties abroad and settled their families in different countries.\nHe said, “if the situation gets worse in Afghanistan, Pakistan will have to accommodate more refugees and it was already entertaining over 3.5 million Afghan refugees.”\nThe minister said entire Afghan cricket team comprised refugees who were brought up here. Similarly majority of Afghan women teaching staff was trained and educated by Pakistan to deliver in their homeland.\nAt present some 6,000 Afghan students were studying in Pakistan’s higher educational institutions on scholarships, he concluded.",
