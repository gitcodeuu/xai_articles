Astrid Lindgren is one of the most translated authors in the world, and one of the most well-known Swedish authors.\nThe first book about Pippi was published in 1945 and has since been translated into more than 70 languages.

Reading books in translation fosters understanding among people and cultures.”\nAs Astrid Lindgren once put it: “ Children have the right to great stories” .\nThe envoy said: “To lose yourself in a story is to find yourself in the grip of an irresistible power. A power that provokes thought, unlocks language, and allows the imagination to roam free.”\nThe Digital readings features renowned Pakistani artists Sania Saeed, Samiya Mumtaz, Mina Malik-Hussain, Nadia Afgan and Fawad Khan. First episode will be aired on Embassy’s fakebook page on 11th August 2021 at 8:00 pm.",
