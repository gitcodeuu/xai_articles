The strategy gave the specifics for the counter-terrorism drive in the country.\nThe counter terrorism operations strategy not only focussed on implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) and inclusion of tribal areas in national mainstream,but also worked on controlling extremism through government’s reforms pertaining to police, education and madrassahs.\nAccording to a senior security official Pakistan’s Pakistan’s military fought the war on the four principles of “clear, hold, build and transfer”. The “clear and hold” phase was implemented from 2010-2017. Different areas were cleared of terrorists and state’s writ was restored in tribal areas. Currently the “build and transfer phase” was in progress. Under this phase, the objective of military was to make “hard-earned gains irreversible”.\nThe Pakistan army, the para military forces along with the Counter Terrorsim Department conducted more than 375,000 intelligence based operations from 2017 to 2020. Out of these, over 34,000 operations were conducted in Punjab, over 150,000 in Sindh, over 80,000 in Balochistan and more than 72,000 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nBy the end of 2020 under Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, action had been taken against 78 terrorist organizations. Their assets have been frozen and their movement was being monitored by the security forces.\nAccording to NACTA 85 organisations have been placed on the Proscribed Organisations list. Of these 79 have been proscribed by the Ministry of Interior, four were under the watch list of Ministry of Interior, while two are under the UNSC Resolutions.\nDuring this period 353 terrorists were killed in the operations and the success of Pakistan’s counter terrorism efforts can be gauged by the fall in Karachi’s crime index ranking from number 6 to 106.\nUnder the multi pronged over 1800 religious leaders united to present an effective narrative (Paigham-i-Pakistan) against extremism.\nThe recent spike in acts of terrorism in various parts of the country have been linked to the evolving situation in Afghanistan, the senior security official said and pointed that the activation of the sleeper cells by the Indian intelligence RAW and the Afghan NDS were the key factors. This was also highlighted by Minister for Interior Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed in his press conference on Monday.",
