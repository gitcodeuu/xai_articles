Allah Almighty had blessed the country with precious resources; he said and regretted that in the past, the people did not do justice with these natural gifts.\nThe prime minister underlined the need of valuing these gifts with proper development and planning.\nHe said once, these areas were developed into tourism spots, they would help change lives of the local people, create jobs with better education and health facilities.\nThe prime minister said the world was experiencing severe climatic impacts in forms of flooding and forest fires, affecting different parts of the globe.\nHe said Pakistan had already been taking lead in the global efforts to reverse climatic change impacts.\nA recent report of UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), comprising a group of scientists, maintained that human activities was changing the temperature of the world in an unprecedented way, the prime minister said, warning that the rise in temperature would make the globe uninhabitable planet if immediate measures were not taken by the world community.\nThe prime minister noted that Balochistan province lacked behind in terms of progress and development due to lack of interest by the former federal governments.\nThe previous rulers preferred to reside in London without taking pains to visit these neglected areas. The Baloch leaders also did not pay attention to the province, he added.\nThe prime minister said for the first time in the country’s history, the federal government was spending a huge amount of Rs1000 billion for the development of Balochistan.\nSuch an amount was never allocated or spent in the province, he said linking progress of Balochistan province with the development of the whole country.\nHe expressed the resolve that government would provide all the basic facilities to the residence of the province.\nThe prime minister further noted that the province was rich with massive mineral resources and if proper planning was done, it would result in huge revenues for the province.\nThe prime minister also announced an additional 12000 acres to be included for mangroves forests in Balochistan. This big announcement came under the umbrella of the 10 Billion Tree Tsunami campaign undergoing across all the country.\nPakistan is already the only country in the world with an expanding mangrove cover spreading from the Indus delta to the coastal areas of Balochistan.\nDuring a briefing given by SAPM Climate Change Malik Amin Aslam, it was informed that these unique ocean growing forests were not only the guardians of the coast but also one of the most important tools for carbon sequestration. As they store four times more carbon than normal forests so this make them a valued natural resource for not only Pakistan but also the world that was feeling the heat of climate change.\nThe prime minister also met with the local women Nighabaans who had played a crucial role for protecting and expanding the mangroves of Balochistan.\nOn the international day for indigenous people being celebrated across the world, he emphasized that all the  green jobs being generated under 10 Billion Tree Tsunami should go to the local communities. They have to become responsible caretakers of nature.\nThe prime minister was on a rare rapid climate action tour of the country going from urban centers to the coastal areas of the country. This shows the climate commitment of the present government with the prime minister personally driving and overseeing climate action on the ground.",
