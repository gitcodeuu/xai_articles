  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 10 (APP):Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib on Tuesday criticised Afghanistan government’s officials for running a dedicated propaganda against Pakistan instead of coordinating with rest of stakeholders to reach a political settlement for ensuring lasting peace in the landlocked country.\nInstead of sitting together and reaching a political settlement for lasting peace, Afghan officials are busy running a dedicated propaganda against Pakistan. This is either inexcusable negligence or willful dereliction of their duty to the people of Afghanistan.\n— Farrukh Habib (@FarrukhHabibISF) August 10, 2021\n“This is either inexcusable negligence or willful dereliction of their duty to the people of Afghanistan,” he said in a tweet while asking the Afghan government to sit together with other stakeholders to reach a political settlement for durable peace in Afghanistan.",
