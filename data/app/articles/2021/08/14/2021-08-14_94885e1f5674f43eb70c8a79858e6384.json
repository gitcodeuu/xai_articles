Pakistan is transforming itself into a digital country with a thriving knowledge-based economy,” he added.\nThe President said after the war in Afghanistan, Pakistan faced the menace of terrorism but the nation successfully overcame this challenge. Paying rich tributes to the sacrifices of the law enforcement agencies and security personnel and the nation, he said approximately 100,000 human lives were lost in this war with 150$ billion losses to the country’s economy.\nPakistan hosted about 3.5 million Afghan refugees on its soil for decades, he said, adding that though different countries, proclaiming themselves as human rights champions, are not willing to accept the refugees and let them drown.\nThe President advised the nation not to hark to the negative elements or pay heed to fake news churned out by the enemies of the state, as its course was rightly set.\nHe said the incumbent government’s endeavours for the achievement of basic principles of Riasat-e-Madina were based upon social justice, provision of health and education facilities, shelter and eradication of poverty.\nDuring the COVID-19, the Prime Minister decided against complete lockdown and on the basis of data, about Rs170 billion amount was provided to 15 million poor and deserving familied under government’s social welfare flagship Ehsaas programme.\nAbout Rs400 to 450 billion worth housing projects were in the pipeline with extension of loan facilities to the people to construct their houses, he said.\nThe country’s exports surged to record $30 billion, remittances reached $29 billion and tax collection surpassed the targets, Pakistan Stock Exchange also broke all the previous records, he added.\nThe President stressed upon the nation to fully participate in Ten Billion Tree Tsunami project to reverse the negative impacts of the global warming and the environmental pollution.\nAbout the grave situation in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), the President urged the international community to take notice of the ongoing Indian atrocities and gross human rights violations.\nThe Indian government was also trying to change the demography of the IIOJK by giving domiciles to non-residents. It wanted to further unleash waves of atrocities against the Kashmiris, but Pakistan was firmly standing in its way, he added.\nHe said the Indian government under the influence of Hindutva and RSS ideology was targeting the minorities in India especially the Muslims through its Citizenship Act.\nThe President regretted that the Prime Minister Imran Khan’s offer to India that Pakistan would move two steps forward in response to India’s one step was taken as its weakness.\nHe observed under such scenario with a bellicose Indian leadership, there was no hope for peace.\nAbout continuing unrest in Afghanistan, the President expressed confidence that all the groups in the neighbouring country would take guidance from the pact of Sulah-e-Hudaibia in reaching an agreement and peaceful settlement of their issues.\nStudents also presented melodious and popular national songs, kalam from the poetry of Allama Muhammad Iqbal and a live performance of vocalist Sahir Ali Bagga also enthralled the audience.",
