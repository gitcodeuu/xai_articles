  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 14 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said on Saturday that the masses were safe only when the institutions were strong.\nIn a tweet, the minister said that the people who run trends against Pakistan and the army from Pakistan’s soil and defend their actions today were stealing their eyes from the situation in Afghanistan.\nافغانستان کے حکمرانوں نے عشروں ملک کو لوٹا وسائل ادارے بنانے پر نہیں لگائے بلکہ ذاتی تجوریاں بھریں اس کا نتیجہ ہے کہ آج ان کا دفاعی حصارریت کی دیوار ثابت ہوا ہے، ہمیں آزادی کی قدر اور ملک کی اہمیت سے روشناس رہنا چاہئے، اور جھوٹے پراپیگنڈوں سے ہشیار بھی رہنا چاہئے\n— Ch Fawad Hussain (@fawadchaudhry) August 14, 2021\nHe said that the Pakistani nation should thank Allah Almighty that the Pakistan Army and other national institutions were performing their duties efficiently and the country was safe.\nThe minister said that Afghan rulers since decades had plundered the amount meant for spending on national institutions. He said that consequently, today their defence has proved very weak.\n” We must be aware of the value of freedom and the importance of the country, and also be wary of false propaganda”, he remarked.",
