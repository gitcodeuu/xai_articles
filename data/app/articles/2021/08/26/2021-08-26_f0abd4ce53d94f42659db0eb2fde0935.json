  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 26 (APP):Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib on Thursday asked the multi-party alliance—Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) to review its own performance instead of criticizing the government for its three-year in power.\nDuring the last couple of years, the parties to the alliance did nothing, but only resorted to infighting and washing each others’ dirty linen in public, he said while addressing to opening ceremony of the first-ever tennis ball cricket tournament of Video Journalists Association of Islamabad.\nHe said the PDM was fully disintegrated as currently there were two factions in the alliance pursuing different narratives. One was insisting on politics of resistance while the other called for politics of reconciliation, he added.\nFarrukh said the past performance of PDM reflected nothing but shame, failures and humiliation. Their movement was solely limited to the blackmailing (the government) for getting an NRO like concession and closure of National Accountability Bureau (NAB).\nHe said their movement had nothing to do with common man. There would have been two-party system in the country, if they really had cared about layman, he added.\nThe minister said the opposition parties during their respective tenures did nothing for welfare of people, but only focused on building properties abroad and amassing corrupt money through Telegraphic Transfers (TTs) and fake bank accounts.\nAbout the proposed Pakistan Media Development Authority, he said a media complaint commission would be set up under the initiative for protection of journalists’ rights.\nHe said the commission would serve as an effective forum to curb financial exploitation of media workers. It would not only help resolve salary related issues of media workers, but also ensure their job security in an effective way, he added.\nTo a query, the minister said it was the first government in the country history’s which had set the tradition of presenting yearly performance reports before public on regular basis. Prior to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, the country was only ruled by those parties that used to put their performance under rug.\nHe said the main purpose of issuing yearly performance was to inform the public about the achievements made by the government on economic, foreign and social fronts.\nFarrukh said the economic indicators were on upward trajectory as there were record remittances pouring in in the country, while exports were surging at fast pace. The current account deficit which left by PML-N at $19 billion was now at its lowest level and the debt-to-GDP ratio was also declining, he added.\nHe said an amount of Rs 260 billion was allocated for the Ehsaas programme to steer the people out of poverty. The Health Card was another major initiative of the government as around health insurance of Rs one million was being offered to each card holder.\nThe minister remarked that the initiative like health card was not even launched in the developed countries.\nHe said an amount of Rs 100 billion was allocated for youth under the Prime Minister’s Kamyab Jawan Programme. So far, soft loans amounting to over Rs 22 billion had been disbursed among young people under the programme, he added.\nHe also mentioned Kamyab Pakistan programme under which the state would provide Rs 500,000 loans to the citizens without any collateral.\nUnder the ‘Apna Ghar, Apna Khawab’, he said the banks had received a large number of applications for low cost houses worth Rs 145 billion. Out of this, applications for housing units worth Rs 50 billion had been approved.\nHe said this was the first government in the history of Pakistan which had taken steps for each and every strata of the society.",
