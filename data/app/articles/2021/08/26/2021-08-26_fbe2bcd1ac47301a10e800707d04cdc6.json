  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 26 (APP): There are around 10,000 Afghan refugees in Delhi, 90% of whom belong to Hindu and Sikh community. Indian government had been showing discrimination to Afghans by only allowing the Hindu and Sikh refugees while discouraging other religions and ethnicities. This indicated the discriminatory and Hindutva mindset of Indian leadership.\nIn addition to that refugees from Afghanistan were on two years asylum visa. After the expiry of the visa they have to return to Afghanistan. There is a need to highlight India’s discriminatory role and on the other hand highlight Pakistan’s role in giving facilities to refugees.\nMost Afghan refugees face problems in accessing facilities in India because they lack citizenship. India discriminates and poorly treats the Afghan refugees.\nAfghan refugees in India face uncertain future because of the discriminatory attitude of Indian government. Afghan nationals first migrated to India during the Soviet war in late 1970s. Afghan refugees have to struggle for basic amenities like a SIM card and gas cylinder.\nIndia is not a signatory to the 1951 United Nations Convention on Refugees, nor does the country have its own specific law on refugees. Therefore, it badly treats the Afghan refugees.\nhttps://www.trtworld.com/magazine/afghan-refugees-in-india-face-an-uncertain-future-49343\nAfghans never get citizenship but continue to live in India on long-term visas provided by the Indian government for two years term and after two years expiry they have to return to Afghanistan and renew their visa.\nhttps://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/afghanistan-crisis-shows-why-caa-is-  needed­hardeep-singh-puri/articleshow/85549052.cms\nIt is clear indication of discriminatory attitude of Modi led BJP government in India that promotes the Hindutva ideology.  By publicly declaring a policy of religious discrimination, New Delhi has not only abandoned millions of Muslims seeking to flee Taliban rule; it has also put a target on Hindus and Sikhs who are still trapped in the country.\nhttps://thediplomat.com/2021/08/india-must-champion-the-cause-of-    afghan-refugees-more­inclusivelv/\nAccording to India’s Ministry of Home Affairs, those seeking citizenship will additionally have to prove that they have been in India on or before December 31, 2014. So there is no question of anyone obtaining Indian citizenship.\nIndia also doesn’t allow dual citizenship. Many western countries give Afghan nationals an opportunity to remain an Afghan citizen even if they resettle in that             country.\nhttps://www.npr.org/2021/08/17 /1 028542798/afghans-refugees-in- neighboring-India-painfully:-follow-news-of-their-home-country\nAfghan students who get education from Indian universities on student visa have an ambiguous legal status in India and an uncertain future.\nDespite the UNHCR’s operations in Delhi, India has not signed the U.N. refugee  agreements.   The   government   has granted   temporary   protection   to   certain   groups, including Tibetans and Sri Lankans. But it lacks an overall asylum framework. Even with U.N. refugee status, many Afghans struggle to make long-term plans in India.\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees operates an office in New Delhi, which grants refugee status to many Afghans and others, and issues them identification cards. The office has been closed since March 2020.\nAfghan asylum seekers cannot work in India, neither can they study.  Afghans are unsafe in India.\nAfghan refugees are lesser in India than other countries in the region such as Pakistan and Iran and even the United States.  India’s CCA law is clear indication of discriminatory attitude of Modi led BJP government in India that promotes the Hindutva ideology.  Afghan refugees lack basic rights in India. India protects only the Sikh and Hindu minorities of Afghan refugees.   Afghan refugees who do not have the UNHCR card cannot study in private educational institutions.",
