  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 26 (APP):The United Nations (UN) International Day against Nuclear Tests will be marked on August 29 across the globe which brings public awareness and education about the effects of global nuclear weapon tests.\nThis day aims to end nuclear testing and promote peace and security.\nThe International Day against Nuclear Tests aims to raise people’s awareness of the need to prevent nuclear catastrophes to avert devastating effects on humankind, the environment, and the planet.\nMany people use the day as an opportunity to share their perspectives on the issue of nuclear weapons and testing.\nDifferent organizations may host educational and public activities to bring awareness of the use of nuclear weapons and the dangers involved with nuclear weapons testing and usage.\nThe history of nuclear testing began on July 16, 1945, when an atomic bomb was used at a desert test site in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in the United States. More than 2000 nuclear tests were carried out worldwide between 1945 and 1996.\nOver the years, there have been calls to ban nuclear tests to protect people’s lives and the environment around them.\nThe UN approved a draft resolution in late 2009 for an international day against nuclear tests to raise public awareness about the threats and dangers of nuclear weapons.\nIt was also hoped that the UN’s member states would move towards the idea of nuclear disarmament.\nThe International Day against Nuclear Tests was declared to be annually held on August 29, which marks the closing of one of the world’s largest nuclear test sites (in Kazakhstan) in 1991.\nThe day is devoted to enhancing public awareness and education about the effects of nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions. It also promotes the need for a nuclear-weapon-free world.\nThe day’s first official observance was marked for August 29, 2010.",
