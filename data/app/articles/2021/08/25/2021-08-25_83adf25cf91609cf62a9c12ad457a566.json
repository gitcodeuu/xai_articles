Korea and Malaysia studied the upward trends in the country. The US president used to come to airport to welcome Pakistani counterparts, he added.\nThe prime minister said the English language should not be made a status symbol and expressed his displeasure at conducting official functions in English language as majority of commoners who watched Tv did not understand it.\nIn parliament, he said, speeches had been made in English language to impress the people.\n“It should be used as medium for getting higher education. Mother tongue is the best medium for imparting education to the children which is helpful in their understanding,” he observed.\nThe prime minister cited that children in their nascent ages could learn a lot if imparted through their respective mother tongues, and cited Switzerland where the children could speak multi-languages.\nWhether in China, Japan or France, they had different sets of educational curriculum? he posed a question, reiterating that single curriculum produced one nation.\nLauding efforts of the Punjab government and the provincial education minister, he said that though they had been undertaking huge work in the province, but it was not properly projected.\nThe reason for not doing it, might be that the provincial government did not want to publicize its good deeds when compared with the previous government which even went for wide publication of its negligible work.\nThe prime minister also observed that with the use of modern technology, different issues like corruption and wastage of resources could be overcome.\nHe cited the paperless working of Saukat Khanum Memorial Hospital and the E-governance system at the federal cabinet level.\nThe prime minister said in the past, no focus was made on the construction of dams for generation of cheap and clean power as no one ever thought of the future generations.\nExpensive power generation was made on costly fuels, he said, adding that forests were destroyed.\nHe also stressed upon the significance of his government’s 10 Billion Tree Tsunami project which had been launched for securing the future of coming generations.\nChief Minister Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar, on the occasion, said that budget allocation for the education sector was enhanced besides, over 200 per cent allocation for the higher education. Primary education throughout the province had been ensured with drastic steps, he added.\nThe online services and facilitation was provided to the teachers and students, besides focusing on the education of transgender’s community.\nProvincial Minister for Education Murad Raas gave an overview of the steps taken for the promotion of education in the province.",
