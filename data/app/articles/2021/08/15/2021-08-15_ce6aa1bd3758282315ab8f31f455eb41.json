However, he said ,it will be implemented from class 6th to 8th from next year while from 9th to 12th from 2023.\nShafqat Mahmood said that the current curriculum was based on injustice where poor people were getting a specific education.\nNow they will have many opportunities, he added. He said, the present system is facilitating specific peoples which is in justice. Those who were getting education in normal schools and Madaris would have to face difficulties in life, he said.\nThe Minister said that the current education system had divided the society and education was like a lens through which we see the society. When lens will be different then society will be viewed through different angles, he said.\nHe said that creating passion of nationalism was an important task. “If a school can teach additional subjects, we have no objection” he said.\nHe further told, we were bringing a system of test for class five and eight so that we can observe who is implementing the curriculum.",
