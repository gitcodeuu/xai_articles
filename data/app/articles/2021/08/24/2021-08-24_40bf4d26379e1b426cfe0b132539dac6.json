TVO has been revitalized under the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division (PASSD) to execute the programmes under the Ehsaas framework (Policy#36).”\nThis policy action, she said, was specifically meant to run partnerships with private sector non-profit organizations, upscale successful programmes for the most marginalized segments, and to strengthen the Ehsaas delivery.\nAfter a preliminary briefing, Dr. Sania left the meeting.\nThe Board meeting then formally commenced its first proceedings for the whole day.\nSeveral important matters were discussed and decided, including the annual action plan, budget and institutionalization of audit systems.\nThe Board also elected Syed Ghazanfar Abbas Jilani, Federal Secretary (R) as a Chairperson, while elected Tariq Khan Baluch, Development Specialist and Hidayat Ullah Khan, Development Expert as the two Vice Chairpersons.\nThe 10-member BoD of the TVO consists of five ex-officio members including Secretaries and senior officials of the Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Division; Ministry of Finance; Ministry of Economic Affairs Division; Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training; and Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination.\nAmongst the five private sector members are Syed Ghazanfar Abbas Jilani, Federal Secretary (R); Tariq Khan Baluch, Development Specialist; Ghulam Abbas Nakai, Auditor General of Pakistan (R); Shamim Akhtar, Social Sector Expert; and Hidayat Ullah Khan, Development Expert. Shehzad Hussain, CEO of the TVO serves as the Secretary to the Board. The Board will meet again next month.\nCreated as an indigenous grant-making organization in 1990 following an agreement between the governments of Pakistan and the United States of America to establish a Special Development Fund, TVO was set up to tap the potential of non-government organizations.\nThe purpose was to aid them in the development process and develop a mechanism for strengthening the contribution of NGOs towards a broader goal of improving the quality of life of the neglected segments of Pakistani population.\nThe Trust became fully functional in 1992. However, due to unavailability of the Board for the past several years, its operations were stalled.\nTo revitalize the organization under Ehsaas, the process of recruitment in the Board commenced earlier this year.\nFollowing an open advertisement, the Board members were invited to serve on the Board.",
