He said under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan,\nPakistan was on the road of progress and development but these elements only want to create hurdles in its journey.\nHe stated that protests were not the way to take countries ahead on the road of progress and development.\nNo one would be allowed to create a hindrance in the journey of public service, he mentioned.",
