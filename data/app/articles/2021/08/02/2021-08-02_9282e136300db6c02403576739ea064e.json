International players Herschelle Gibbs and Tillakaratne Dilshan will arrive in Pakistan on Tuesday to participate in the Kashmir Premier League.\nAfridi paid tribute to the players, their cricket boards and governments for supporting cricket in the world.\nHe said “It is hoped that the Pakistan Cricket Board will soon issue NOCs to Fakhr Zaman, Shadab Khan, Usman Qadir, Imam-ul-Haq and Muhammad Hasnain to participate in the KPL.”\nThe Indian government is requested to keep sports separate from the politics, said Afridi.\n“Games connect people while hatred breaks people.\nThe Indian government and the Board for Control of Cricket in India (BCCI) is requested that cricket is a gentleman’s game, don’t contaminate it with your dirty politics,” Shehryar said.\nThe International Cricket Councils (ICC’s) clear response to the Hindutva government is another setback on India’s diplomatic front, he added.\nAzad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) is all set to hold first-ever CrickFest, KPL, from August 6, in Muzaffarabad.",
