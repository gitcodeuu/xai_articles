  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 10 (APP): Minister for Foreign Affairs Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Thursday asked the opposition to review its ‘pathetic and inappropriate’ attitude and proactively take part in legislative process in the House.\nResponding to the opposition members’ points in the National Assembly, the minister said the opposition had the right of criticism, but it should be constructive and not for the sake of point-scoring.\nOn one hand, they were alleging that the government was not taking the House seriously, and on the other they resorted to tactics of staging walk-outs or pointing out quorum to create hurdles in the process of legislation, he added.\nThe minister invited the opposition to take active part in the legislative business as they were sent to the august House by their voters for the purpose.\nEarlier, soon after recitation of the verses from the Holy Quran and National Anthem, Zahra Wadood Fatemi of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz pointed out the quorum. However, upon counting the House was found in order.\nLater, speaking in the House, Syed Naveed Qamar of Pakistan Peoples Party alleged that the government was not giving due weightage to the opposition and suspended the rules to take up legislative business. They were not given enough time to go through the bills, he added.\nRana Tanver of the PML-N said the bills should be passed through consensus by taking the opposition on board.",
