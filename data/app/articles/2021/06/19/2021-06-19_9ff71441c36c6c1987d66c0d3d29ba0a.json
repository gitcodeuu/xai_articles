  "content": "ISLAMABAD, June 19 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain Saturday termed a call of Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz Sharif for holding All Parties Conference (APC) on electoral reforms as absolutely ridiculous.\nIn a press statement, the minister said Shahbaz Sharif bypassed the parliament over the issue of electoral reforms and due legislation.\n“The people who are in the habit of election rigging, how can they give suggestions over the holding of fair and transparent elections!” he expressed his wonder.\nThe minister said after the failure of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), Shahbaz Sharif had coined a new story. How these people would attend APC who had turned their back in PDM and levelled allegations over each other during by-elections? he questioned.\nFawad said the so-called claimants of the supremacy of parliament were today trampling its respect.\nSuch legislation was carried out inside the parliament, he said, adding, the opposition leader was becoming a part and parcel of the agenda to weaken parliament which was highly regrettable.\nThe information minister further said a failed opposition was now out trying in vain to cover up their abysmal failures, however, he was confident that their cover-up story would not get public attention.\n“The people have found out their reality and true worth, as now the public is fully conscientious and cannot be fooled by them anymore,” he added.",
