He said, the budget of the incoming local governments has been increased by 20 to 30 percent.\nThe government has increased TMs budget from Rs. 9 billion to Rs. 15 billion so that at one hand all the problems being faced by the people could be addressed at the local government level and on the other hand mega projects of development could be initiated, he informed.\nHe said, the budget has been increased so that money allocated for development works could not be used for salaries. He said that the Budget figures were factual and based on facts and the federal government had also promised to pay the funds.\nTaimur Saleem Jhagra said that no attention had been paid in the past to improve the power system and the federal government had made significant progress in paying net profit of hydropower, adding, for the first time in last 8 months, net profit of hydropower is being paid regularly.\nThe federal government has agreed to pay Rs 36 billion in arrears of net profit of hydropower, Taimur Jhagra disclosed and added, the revenue has been increased to Rs 4 billion and the government has set revenue target at Rs 75 billion. He said, the element of trust in the government was low in the past.\nAbout the tax collection he said, steps have been taken for reducing tax collection rate that certainly boosts tax culture.\n“If the situation in Quetta improves, the economic situation will improve further”, he said and added that the government had provided substantial funds for the Billion Tree Tsunami while the provincial government was releasing substantial funds for the tribal areas.\nAnother key step the government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has taken is to give loans of more than Rs 10 billion to the people.

Regarding reservations on salaries and allowances,\nhe said that a committee had been formed to look into the matter. All reservations and issues will be resolved after careful consideration and the government employees will not be deprived of their rights as housing allowances have different ratings.\nRegarding debt burden on Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said, that the government had taken two types of short and long term loans; interest rates on short term loans are very low for which there is a transparent method of repayment while long term loans with a term of 30 to 40 years are very easy and regular.\nHe said that the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government was not facing any difficulty due to repayment of loans which is two percent of the total budget. He said that Rs 100 billion had been allocated for merged districts and not a single penny would be wasted.\n“We are trying to vaccinate 7 to 9 million people by September and that is why the vaccination of 18-29 year old citizens and women have been started,” he said.
