Good governance is the backbone of human and democratic development and plays a crucial role in poverty alleviation.”\nThe envoy said the new project would respond to the priorities of the EU-Pakistan Strategic Engagement Plan 2019, specifically to the joint priority “Democracy, Rule of Law, Good Governance and Human Rights” and was financed under the EU’s development cooperation priorities from 2014-2020.\nBoth strategic roadmaps supported the implementation of the Vision 2025 and helped achieve the Strategic Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations in its Agenda 2030, she added.\nThe envoy said the EU would continue to support Pakistan in its efforts to tackle poverty, increase education, promote good governance, rule of law and ensure sustainable management of natural resources.\nShe lauded the services rendered by both GIZ Pakistan and PIPS for capacity building in the national institutions and expressed her satisfaction in launching the project.\nEarlier, the EU Pakistan and the representatives of GIZ Pakistan and PIPS have officially singed a memorandum of understanding regarding the project and its financing in a ceremony held here.\nCountry Director GIZ Tobias Becker, in a statement, said “We are honoured that the Consortium of GIZ and PIPS has been entrusted by the EU Delegation and the Government of Pakistan, with the implementation of this highly significant project to support in the strengthening of democratic governance, and to work with the honourable members of Parliament and institutions that shape legislation and pave the way for the future human and democratic development of our partner country.”\nPIPS Executive Director Muhammad Anwar said the EU’s Parliamentary Support Project was a landmark initiative as it would enable the institute to work closely with GIZ in assisting the members of parliament across both sides of isles to develop insights on their arduous tasks of representation, legislation and oversight of the executive by applying concepts of transparency, inclusivity and participation to achieve effectiveness and efficiency in parliamentary output at federal and provincial levels.\nThe project, he said, would also undertake capacity building of the secretariat staff of all legislatures in the country.\nReported By Shabbir Hussain\nDigital News Service of APP,",
