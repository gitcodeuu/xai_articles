Girl recipients under Ehsaas undergraduate scholarships appreciated that half of the scholarships are reserved for girls.\nStudents also shared their academic ambitions and problems that they had faced to pursue higher education.\nStudents who came to the table with Dr. Sania were from diverse regional and social backgrounds including Bahawalpur, Hyderabad, Khairpur, Zhob, Turbat, Gilgit, Ghizer, Chitral and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. They were studying in different undergraduate disciplines-Bioinformatics, Economics, Social Sciences, Archaeology, Botany and Pakistan Studies etc.\nEncouraging students to benefit from Ehsaas undergraduate scholarship programme, Dr. Sania stated, “Ehsaas Undergraduate Scholarship Policy has been designed to ensure that no student is deprived of higher education because he or she is unable to meet the financial requirements.\nEvery student who is admitted to a 4–5-year undergraduate degree programme at any of 119 public sector university with a family income below the threshold of Rs. 45,000/month is eligible to apply, and scholarships are given out based on merit.”\nDescribing the process followed for the award of Ehsaas scholarships, Dr. Ali said, “As many as 451 Ehsaas scholarships have been granted to deserving students in the two years.\nThese scholarships are being awarded on transparency and merit to help the deserving students get higher education.”",
