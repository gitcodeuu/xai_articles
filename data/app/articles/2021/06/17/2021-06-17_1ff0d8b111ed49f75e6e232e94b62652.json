The road would help enhance trade with Afghanistan and other parts of the country, he added.\nHe said there was no mobile network in Pashin district and students could not get online education due to unavailability of cellular network. He urged the government to provide the cellular and internet facility to the people of remote areas.\nNuzhat Pathan of the PTI said the government had successfully contained the COVID-19 pandemic with devising prudent policies. She said despite so many challenges, the government presented a people-friendly budget.\nShe said the government was providing interest free loans to the common people for buying their own house first time in the country’s history.\nRana Mubashir Iqbal of the PML-N suggested that corona vaccine should be administered through polio teams as they had enough experience of vaccinating children during door-to-door campaigns.\nKanwal Shauzab of the PTI said Prime Minister Imran Khan was the first leader of Islamic Ummah, who had highlighted the “Islamophobia” issue at international fora.\nShe said the incumbent government had successfully removed all the “economic mines” planted by the last PML-N regime.\nThe PTI government inherited record current account deficit of $ 19.8 billion, but owing to its prudent policies it was now in surplus.
