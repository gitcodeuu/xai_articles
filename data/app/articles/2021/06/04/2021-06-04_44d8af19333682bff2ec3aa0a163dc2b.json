The media also gave an impression as Naya Pakistan can emerge by switching a button,” he said.\nThe prime minister said it always took time to change the status quo as the mafias resisted any such movement to protect their interests. Similarly, the opposition also yearned for the government’s failure to protect their laundered money and properties abroad.\nHe said rule of law was the only factor behind the nations’ success as all the developed countries had no room for mafias and everyone was accountable before law.\nHe said Pakistan sailed through the COVID situation owing to the government’s prudent policies contrary to India, despite the fact that both the countries had almost identical population density and weather conditions.\nHe said government took a year to stabilize the economy and in second year it was hit by pandemic but it managed well by maintaining a balance between the lives and livelihood.\nNow, the prime minster said as the economy had made a turnaround, the government was focusing the agriculture sector by ensuing timely and reasonable payments of crops to the farmers who also got bumper crop this year.\nMoreover, the government was about to announce a special package for the farmers besides promoting industrial sector through special economic zones to boost exports.\nSimilarly, he said the IT sector was also under the government’s focus to exploit immense potential as India was earning around $80 billion from IT exports.\nImran Khan said the construction of 10 dams was in progress to produce clean energy and utilize the 50,000MW potential of hydropower. For the first time, massive scale plantation was being made under Ten Billion Tree Tsunami and new national parks being developed, he added.\nHe said as the COVID-19 curve was on downward trend particularly after mass vaccination, the government would make efforts to uplift the tourism sector which had the potential to increase foreign reserves remarkably.\nReferring to the government’s incentives for construction sector, the prime minister said banks had received demand of Rs 60 billion loans for low-cost houses from the people who could never imagine to own a house.\nHe said the government was also mulling to introduce finance houses other than banks to exclusively disburse housing loans.\nIn his address, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said the Lodhran-Multan road would benefit three districts and connect two divisions of Multan and Bahawalpur.\nHe said the South Punjab Secretariat was an extraordinary step that would go a long way to strengthen the federation by addressing the political imbalance.\nHe said just like the long term policy of construction of dams in the country, the South Punjab Secretariat would also a step towards balanced political mapping which no other government could do.\nHe said in the upcoming Public Sector Development Program, the South Punjab would have its separate share.\nCommunications Minister Murad Saeed said beside this road, the PSDP allocation has also been made for Lodhran-Multan motorway.
