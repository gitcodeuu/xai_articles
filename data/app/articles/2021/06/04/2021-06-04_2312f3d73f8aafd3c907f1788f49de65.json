He said absence of technical staff was another challenge for the implementation of rules and regulations.\nAbout the World Environment Day (WED) 2021, Muhammad Rizwan said the EPD, with nod from Chief Minister Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar, has decided to celebrate the first week of June as ‘Environment Week’ every year across the province.\nMinister Environment Punjab Muhammad Rizwan hailed Prime Minister Imran Khan for his leadership role in fighting environmental challenges, adding that PM Imran Khan’s efforts have won the country respect and acclaim globally.",
