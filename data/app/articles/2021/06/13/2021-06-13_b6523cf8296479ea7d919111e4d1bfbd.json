The elected representatives also apprised the CM about the problems of their respective constituencies, said a handout issued here.\nUsman Buzdar assured them of resolving their issues on priority basis and said that his doors were always open for all. He asserted that the new fiscal year budget would open a new chapter of development and prosperity for the people of the province as substantial funds were being allocated in the budget. More funds would be allocated for education, health, agriculture, infrastructure and other social sectors, he added.\nThe chief minister said that separate development packages had been devised for all districts. The negative politics of the conspirators had been buried forever. Now the politics of public service would prevail instead of politics of anarchy, he added.\nHe said that there was no room for corruption and corrupt elements in Naya (new) Pakistan under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan. Without caring for criticism, the journey of public service would be further accelerated, he said adding that the negative politics of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had met its logical end and people had rejected the politics of chaos.\nThe PDM’s end was quite a lesson for those who were engaged in the negative politics, he added. The attempts of opposition to divide the nation failed miserably, he added. The people of Pakistan were well aware and would never be fooled by the corrupt elements, he said.\nThose who met the Chief Minister included Mian Jalil Ahmed Sharqpuri, Chaudhry Ashraf Ali Ansari, Muhammad Ghias-ud-Din, Muhammad Faisal Khan Niazi, Raees Nabeel Ahmed and Ghazanfar Abbas and Azhar Abbas Chandia. Chief Whip Punjab Assembly MPA Syed Abbas Ali Shah, Tahir Bashir Cheema, Younis Ansari and Masood Majeed were also present.",
