Shahbaz Gill lashed out at Ahsan Iqbal of the PML-N, who was trying to create hurdle in the vote right for the overseas Pakistanis.\nHe appreciated the efforts of Federal Information and Broadcasting Minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain for paving the way for the use of EVMs and added that 600 EVMs would be ready in coming few months.\nHe said that reasonable increase had been witnessed in the production of crops including maize, sugarcane, rice and wheat whereas during the tenures of the PPP and the PML-N, the production of crops was facing downward trend.\nHe said that the PTI government was determined to pay special attention to farmers around the year with the aim to ensuring development of the agriculture sector.\nHe said that due to efforts of the PTI government, the foreign reserves touched the mark of $23 billion, while the current account deficit had reduced to zero.\nHe said that our income was more and expenses were less.\nThe special assistant said that in the current federal budget, the poor segments of society were given priority and Rs 260 billion had been set aside for Ehsaas programme, and added that all saved money would be utilised for the welfare of less privileged segments of society.\nHe said, “The poor people can be provided support when the government will reduce its expenses and increases its revenue.”\nTo a question, he said that the PTI government would complete its constitutional tenure.\nTo another query, he said that the government was thankful to Allah Almighty and it was due to our love for Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) that Pakistan faced less losses due to coronavirus pandemic, compared with other countries.",
