Pakistan welcomes the renewed emphasis to combat HIV/AIDS in the 2021 Political Declaration, he added.\nHe said that there is an imperative need to accelerate efforts to end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, through HIV/AIDS prevention, care, support and treatment, provision of sexual and reproductive health services, community engagement, awareness-raising, and addressing stigma and discrimination.\nHe said that the international community needs a global compact on health, where no one is denied their right to health and everyone has Universal Health Coverage.\nEnding HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030 should be one of the priority areas of this global compact which would translate our commitments into tangible actions and outcomes, he added.",
