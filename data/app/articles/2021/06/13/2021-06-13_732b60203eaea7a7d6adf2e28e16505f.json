Connecting with masses, Dr. Sania Nishtar replied to questions of live callers who phoned her from remote areas of the country.\nResponding to the caller’s question about the reopening of Ehsaas Registration Desks, Dr. Nishtar informed that Ehsaas Registration Desks are temporarily closed nationwide owing to the current wave of COVID-19 pandemic.\nThose who have received responses from 8171 to go to registration desks, will be able to register themselves in Ehsaas when the Desks reopen after June 30, 2021. Also, Ehsaas will introduce an appeal system in September 2021 for those households who are ineligible on 8171, she said.\nEducating the people about fake online registration portals, mobile apps and SMS messages being circulated in the name of Ehsaas, Dr. Nishtar cautioned that Ehsaas has not introduced any online resource for Ehsaas registration.\nShe told the people that there were only two ways through which deserving households can register themselves in Ehsaas; the Ehsaas Survey and Ehsaas Registration Desks.\nAbout Fake SMS complaints, Dr. Nishtar encouraged the listeners to report fake SMS complaints on Ehsaas programmes so that the concerned authorities can take immediate action.\nTo tackle the menace, Ehsaas has deployed two mobile lines for the public; 0335-1058050 and 0335-1058051 besides sending of messages from from Ehsaas through 8171 and not through any other number, underlined Dr. Nishtar.\nDr. Nishtar also responded to the queries of callers from Rajanpur and Bhakkar about the process of accessing Ehsaas interest free loans. She provided the listeners with instructional and beneficiary centered information about Ehsaas programs and initiatives.\nThe Ehsaas e-Kacheri was broadcast on Radio Pakistan’s national hook up programme Raabta as well as on Facebook, @EhsaasOffcialPK.\nDuring the e-Kacheri, Dr. Nishtar also listened to the issues and concerns of Ehsaas beneficiaries, guided them sympathetically and assured that their issues will be resolved at the earliest.\nThe people shared their Computerized National Identity Cards numbers in the programme and in return were instantaneously provided with their eligibility and payment status.\nRegarding the second round of Ehsaas Emergency Cash, Dr. Nishtar apprised listeners, “The Economic Coordination Committee of the Cabinet has approved the launch of the second phase of the Ehsaas Emergency Cash. Under the programme, Rs.12,000 financial assistance would be provided to each of the 4 million additional households.\nThese additional households will be identified through the ongoing Ehsaas survey which is 91 percent complete.”\nShe continued that the purpose was to compensate affected households for unemployment caused by COVID-19 crises.\nPayments to women of eligible households will be initiated within this financial year andthe women can collect payment upon receiving the message, she told.",
