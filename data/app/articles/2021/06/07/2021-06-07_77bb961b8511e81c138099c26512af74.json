The Control Room received a call about the collision at 3:48 a.m, due to which as many as two bogies of Sir Syed Express derailed, while its three bogies overturned.\nFawad said all officials concerned reached the incident site at 6:30 a.m. to supervise rescue and relief operations.\nHe said Minister for Railways Azam Khan Swati also reached the incident site at 9 a.m. through a special plane on directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nThe minister expressed deep grief and sorrow over the loss of precious lives in the tragedy and sympathized with the bereaved families.\nUnfortunately, he said, since long due investment could not be made in railway and other departments, which led to their deterioration.\nBut now, he said, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government had brought a biggest-ever project of ML-I (Main Line-1), which would help improve the railways system and its efficiency.",
