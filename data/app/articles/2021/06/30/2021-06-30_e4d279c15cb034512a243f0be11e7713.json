The center would address the complaints of the people and address their needs in real time. A differently abled individual can have multiple avenues of redress in the center.\n“Not only all the services have been provided in this center at one place but the processes are being simplified to facilitate the poor,” Dr. Nishtar said.\nThe second part of the One Window Ehsaas initiative is the digital e-portal with people centered information; this was built learning from the questions on social media about various Ehsaas programs.\nThe third part of this initiative is an app which mirrors information on the digital portal but in addition, it also marks locations of our service sites: Langars, Panagahs and payment sites.\nThe fourth part, she mentioned, is the integrated digital interface facing the back office, which facilitates access of all those working in the Ehsaas ecosystem to appropriate links and resources.\nThe fifth component of One Window Ehsaas is the integrated database which would enable transparency, she explained.\nThe sixth pillar of One Window Ehsaas, is the Standardized Beneficiary Targeting Policy ensuring standardized beneficiary targeting using the Proxy Means Test.\nAfter the briefing, the media personnel were given a round of the center by Dr. Nishtar wherein they explored operations of One Window Ehsaas Center and met with the staff and beneficiaries.",
