  "content": "ZIARAT, June 1 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan on Tuesday said that with Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth estimated at around 4% during the current fiscal (2020-21), the country had been steered out of economic hardships and was set to achieve further growth in the coming year.\n“I have good news to share with you that the country is coming out of economic hardships. The GDP growth is estimated at around 4% and has been made public,” Imran Khan said while speaking to a gathering here at Quaid’s residency.\nThe Prime Minister regretted that the opposition parties, which have been claiming about the government’s failure for the last two and half years, were now disputing the GDP growth figure.\n“In fact the opposition parties wanted the present government to fail in economic terms, as they feared that if the government succeeds, their politicking would end,” he remarked.\nThe Prime Minister said that, “Since the present government came to power, the opposition parties were giving deadlines for the end of government sometime in three months or by December 31 etc. But I am worried about the opposition that what will they do now?.”\nHe expressed his belief that the country will achieve further economic growth during the next fiscal year. “Pakistan will go further up [in economic terms] during our next government,” he maintained.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan said the present government despite the economic restraints due to the debt burden it inherited and the fact that there was coalition government in the province, was spending much in Baluchistan because it owned the people of Baluchistan, which was neglected in the past.\n“If the previous governments would have spent more in the Baluchistan in the past, situation of the province would have been better,” he remarked.\nThe Prime Minister said that the leaders had two choices either to make money for themselves or spend on the nation. “If I think about palaces in London….How I will think about nation?” he remarked.\nImran Khan referred to the contribution of Mahatir Muhammad and Lee Kuan Yew – leaders of Malaysia and Singapore, in the development of their countries and said they did not made money or built palaces in London but served their countries and nations.\nHe said that Ziarat can be turned into a tourism hub for enhancing the income of local populace and check poverty.\nThe Prime Minister said that Khyber Pakhtoonkhwam, which faced terrorism and even lost the lives of 500 policemen, achieved enhanced development during the 2013-18 government of Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI).\nHe also referred to the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) report which acknowledged reduction in poverty, reduction of gap in the rich and poor and enhanced spending in the areas of human development, education, health and tourism.\nThe Prime Minister further said that with half of KP population given health insurance cards previously, now the KP government had achieved 100% coverage of health insurance in the province providing the facility of Rs. one million for every family to get free medical treatment from any hospital.\nSimilarly, he said, the government of Punjab will also provide the facility of health insurance across the province by the end of 2021, adding, due to the health insurance scheme, a network of hospitals would be established in KP and Punjab by the private sector.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan also urged the Baluchistan government to launch the health insurance scheme in the province for the benefit of people, especially the poor ones, who face many economic hardships in case a family member got ill.\nAbout the problem of non-availability of sui-gas in Ziarat, he assured that in order to address issue, the government, after having done the feasibility of the project, would provide funds for the establishment of an LPG (Liquified Petroleum Gas) plant in the area during the next fiscal year.\nThe Prime Minister said that as it was the duty of federal government to help the government and people of Baluchistan in development of the province, the government would do all to achieve the objective.\nImran Khan further said as he believed that Pakistan’s progress depended on inclusive development, the government would continue to support Baluchistan and other areas of the country including the merged tribal areas (erstwhile FATA) in KP, southern areas of Punjab including Mianwali, Bhakkar, DG Khan and Interior Sindh, which lagged behind due to past neglect.\nHe also mentioned the government’s historic Ehsaas Program which comprised support for skill development, women empowerment in village, loans for youth and said all these schemes were meant to support the poor.\nBesides, the Prime Minister said, under the Naya Pakistan Housing Program, low income people including the salaried class, labourers, mechanics etc. were being provided houses and apartments on ownership basis through easy installments equaling the amounts they pay for a rented house.\nThe Prime Minister said he was pleased to visit the Quaid’s Residency, where the founder of nation passed his days, and said he always desired to visit the residency, which is a historic monument.\nThe Prime Minister on this occasion also expressed his grief over the martyrdom of Frontier Constabulary (FC) personnel in terrorist attack in Quetta and Turbat on Tuesday and prayed for peace of departed souls as well as for fortitude of the bereaved family members.\nChief Minister Baluchistan Jam Kamal in his welcome remarks on the occasion said the visit of Prime Minister Imran Khan despite the terrorist incident showed the present government’s resolve to fight terrorism and foil the designs of anti-Pakistan elements.\nHe praised the Prime Minister for initiating various development projects in Baluchistan including roads and highways for enhanced connectivity of the province and spending and allocating billions of rupees for that purpose.\nThe Chief Minister Baluchistan pointed out the problem of non-availability of natural gas in Ziarat and proposed for the establishment an LPG plant in the area, which besides addressing the issue will also help preserve the precious thousands years old Juniper trees in the area, cut by local people to fulfill their needs of cooking and heating.",
