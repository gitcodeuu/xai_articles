She said exchange rate in Pakistan on June 1st was around Rs 152 against dollar; while in August 2020 it was recorded at highest rate of of Rs.168.87.\nAfter this escalation, all import-oriented companies had increased their prices; specially the pharmaceutical and automobile sectors.\nHowever, now when dollar is almost 17 rupees down, there was no reduction in prices seen; while those prices must have come down considerably by now ranging from 20 to 25 percent, she commented.\nShe urged the price control and regulatory authorities of pharmaceutical and automobile sectors to take cognizance of the situation and bring down the prices of the essential medicines at the earliest.\nShe said they had fixed the gas and electricity rates for the textile industry till June, and it was likely power division may extended the same to facilitate exports.\nThe Pakistan Tehreek e Insaaf leader also urged the State Bank of Pakistan to direct private banks to expedite the credit facility to the business community of Balochistan to promote industrialisation in the province; as Balochistan has huge potential and if availability of credit has been given to local traders they could witness the economic growth.",
