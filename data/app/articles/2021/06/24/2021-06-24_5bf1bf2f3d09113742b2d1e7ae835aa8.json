The government was committed to bring APP on par with Reuters and Agence- France Presse (AFP), he added.\nHe said APP had a vast network, which could be used for disseminating positive local stories, besides promoting tourism at the local and international levels.\nRadio Pakistan, he said, would also be digitized on modern lines.\nAt the present Radio Pakistan had about Rs one billion liabilities, he said, adding it owned properties worth billions of rupees, which could be unitized for its uplift.\nThe minister said it was being considered to include the employees of Radio Pakistan in the Prime Minister’s housing initiative.\nHe said it was unfortunate that the government land was illegally occupied by the land grabbers, and steps were being taken to rectify the situation.\nThe minister said the Federal Cabinet had recently approved the Public Properties (Removal of Encroachment) Bill, 2021 to pave way for reclaiming government land encroached by certain elements.\nUnder the law, he said, an officer would be appointed by the Federal Government, who would be empowered to issue show cause notices to encroachers and, in case of an unsatisfactory answer, he could take necessary action which included punishment and imposition of fine.\nHe apprised the committee that a comprehensive film policy had been prepared, which would be helpful in collaborating with different countries, including China, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\nThe committee members recommended opening of the cinema houses, closed due to the coronavirus pandemic, with the anti-COVID-19 SOPs (standard operating procedures).\nThe minister asked the committee chairman to convene the forum’s meeting in Karachi to get a briefing on the film industry and meet with representatives of film association.\nThe committee chairman told the meeting that the forum had approved a bill for the welfare of the journalist community, which was opposed by the opposition.\nThe members appreciated the initiatives taken for the welfare of media.\nMeanwhile, Fawad called upon the national media channels to pay more attention to international issues and politics.\nHe regretted that the national channels did not discuss the All Parties Conference, summoned by the Indian government on Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nEarlier, Information and Broadcasting Secretary Shahera Shahid briefed the committee about the functioning of the ministry and its attached departments.",
