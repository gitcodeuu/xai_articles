In Sha Allah, this budget will bring the good news for sustainable growth,“ he said.\nThe minister said the government steered the economy, out of crisis and put it on the growth trajectory by pursuing prudent policies under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nTarin said the stabilization phase of national economy was over now and the budget 2021-211 would focus on ‘inclusive and sustainable growth.’ “The budget 2021-22 will be about fostering growth and investment. We have set a target of 4.8% growth, which would be broad-based as it encompasses all the key sectors of the economy.”\nHe announced 10 percent ad-hoc relief allowance in the salaries and pensions of federal government employees, which would be effective from July1.\nSimilarly, to minimize the inflationary pressures, especially on the labourers and workers, the government has increased the minimum wage to Rs 20,000 per month.\nSharing achievements of the incumbent government, the minister said that the government completely eliminated current account deficit of $20 billion to a surplus of about $800 million, brought down the primary deficit from a high of 3.8% to less than 1%; reduced expenditures and increased revenues, improved allocations for social sector under Ehsaas, and introduced Public Finance Management, encompassing all areas of budget, finance, expenditures, debt management, cash management and development spending.\nDuring the current year, the agriculture sector did perform well despite locust attacks and all the major crops, except cotton, witnessed positive growth.\nLikewise, the services and the large scale manufacturing sectors also had considerable growth despite COVID-19 factor.\nHe said during the next fiscal year, Rs 1 billion would be spent on the Locust Emergency and Food Security project, Rs 2 billion for enhancing productivity of rice, wheat, cotton, sugarcane and pulses, Rs 1 billion for enhancing olive cultivation on commercial scale, and Rs 3 billion for improvement of water-courses.\nHe said the government was evolving a comprehensive strategy, under which the farmers would be provided seeds, fertilizers, loans, tractors and machinery, besides setting up cold storages and commodity warehousing to help increase their income.\nHe said one of the top priorities of incumbent government was to uplift the downtrodden segments, and for the purpose 40% of the total population was given cash transfers, besides providing relief to 15 million households across the country.\nHe said the downtrodden segments would be fully taken care of as the government would adopt a ‘bottom-up approach’ to help upto six million households and save them from ‘trickle-down effect’.\nTarin said the government would have to ensure 6 to 7 percent growth to accommodate the youth, as 65 percent of the population was below 30.\nHe said the housing and construction sector was also on priority as around 10 million houses were required, adding a comprehensive strategy has also been devised to bring improvements in energy sector.\nThe minister said the development budget was enhanced from Rs 630 billion to Rs 900 billion, which was an increase of around 40%.\nHe said the three large dams – Dasu, Diamer Bhasha, and Mohmand dams – were the priority in the budget.

government had taken several measures to provide tax relief to existing tax-payers, besides introducing measures to enhance tax-to-GDP ratio.\nDuring the current year, he said historic refunds were paid which stood at 119 percent higher than the corresponding period of last year.\nHe said that the proposed tax policy would emphasize on expansion of tax base through identification of new tax payers, gradual removal of exemptions and concessionary provisions and reduction in tax rate.\nThe tax policy would be based on self-assessment, under which outside auditors would be conducting the audit of filed returns, however the government would introduce a mechanism to go after tax evaders.\nThe minister said no new taxes would be imposed on the salaried class, while a system of track and trace would be implemented initially with four industries and expanded to the full spectrum of industrial and trading activities.\nA major strategy would be the expansion of GST base and in this regard, he said the government would bring into the tax net all retail and wholesale transactions which were using emerging and evolving digital and electronic payment systems.\n“To this effect, we would help traders install the point-of-sale (POS) equipment and link it up to the FBR system”, he added.\nThe minister said Pakistan Single Window would be operational in near future to facilitate clearance of imports and exports.\nTo facilitate small businesses, he said threshold of annual turnover was being enhanced and now a cottage industry, having annual turnover of up to Rs 10 million will not be required to register for sales tax.\nHe announced withdrawal of FED and Reduction in Sales Tax on Locally Manufactured cars up to 850 cc, adding that rising prices of locally manufactured small cars was a major concern for low-earning families. Accordingly, he proposed that small cars up to 850 cc capacity may be exempted from FED besides reducing Sales Tax rate from 17% to 12.5%.\nThe minister said that tax incentives for promoting electric vehicles were also proposed to address environmental issues, reduce reliance on gasoline and provide cheaper source of transportation to public.\nThe rate of federal excise duty on telecommunication has been proposed to be reduced from 17% to 16%.\nThe minister also proposed FED on mobile phone calls, exceeding 03 minutes, internet data usage and SMS messages.\nHe proposed inclusion of sugar in the Third Schedule to the Sales Tax Act so that tax is charged on actual retail price of the product.\nThe delay in the issuance of exemption certificate was a major concern of taxpayers, he said adding that it was proposed that time limit of fifteen days might be observed for issuance of exemption certificate for corporate taxpayers after the lapse of statutory time limit.\nHe said reduction in Withholding Tax Regime by 40 percent was proposed, adding that in past, there has been a trend to collect direct taxes in the indirect manner. He said it would not only increases burden on the people but raise compliance cost for the documented sectors of the economy.\nThe government proposed that withholding tax on services related to oilfield, warehousing, security, logistic, telecommunication and collateral management,\nmay be reduced to 3% from existing 8%.\nThe rate of capital gain tax would be reduced to 12 5% from 15%, he said adding that adjustment of Losses against Property Income under present legal dispensation current year business loss was adjustable against income under all heads except property and salary income.\nTo promote IT services, freelancers and export of other services, a special regime at par with export of goods regime, has been proposed for all services receipts which are brought to Pakistan through banking channel, shall be taxed at a reduced rate of 1% under final tax regime and no question thereafter shall be asked about it, he added.\nThe Special Economic Zones were exempted from tax however, under the law they are still liable to pay minimum tax on their turnover. This is causing hardship to the investors. It is proposed that SEZ enterprises would be exempted from minimum tax for tax-year 2021.\nHe said multiple relief measures have been taken for livestock & poultry sectors as well as agricultural sector in this budget.\nThe minister said that that government has taken kinetic measures to boost the industrial growth to tear away the label of fragile, attached with the economy, adding that this government from the day one, focused on boosting domestic industry and reducing their cost of doing business.",
