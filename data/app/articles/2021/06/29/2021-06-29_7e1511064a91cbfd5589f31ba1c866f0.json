Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) signed at 13.7% of brent [oil] price whilst PTI [Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf] signed at 10.2%,” he tweeted while mentioning the expensive agreements signed by the previous government for procurement of the commodity.\nHe said 30 per cent of the LNG was being bought at spot prices, adding “Their prices are publicly available.”",
