He asked students to thoroughly investigate for reaching to the conclusion on any matter.\nHe said the government would expand its talent based programmes for providing more opportunities to the students.\nHe announced that PSF has increased the prize money for winning students from\nRs10,000 to Rs100,000.\nThe minister appreciated the PSF efforts for providing science students best opportunities to excel in national and international competitions.\nHe said PSF’s programmes have boosted youth talent and science students have converted deprivation into opportunities.\nCoordinator General COMSTECH, Dr Iqbal Choudhary and Chairman PSF, Prof. Dr. Shahid Mahmood Baig also addressed the function.\nWinners of top positions in international science competitions including Haris, Ms Zakia Tul Jannat and Umair Masood also shared their experiences with the audience.\nCoordinator General COMSTECH Dr Iqbal Choudhary in his address said that motivation and inspiration are the catalysts for excelling in any field and achieving the goals and targets.\nMany factors trigger motivation and inspiration but the most important are the elements of competition and the desire of proving the best one among others and its recognition, he added.\nThe science competitions including science quiz, essays, posters, models, innovations and projects etc at the national and international levels are the best way of science popularization and generating students’ interest in science.\nThese competitions not only motivate students for hard work to win but also their interaction with other students open their minds for learning new things about science and creativity, the federal secretary maintained.\nThe winning students also become role models for other students and become a source of inspiration as well as motivation, he concluded.\nPSF Chairman Prof. Dr. Shahid Mahmood Baig in his address highlighted the Foundation’s research and science popularization programmes.",
