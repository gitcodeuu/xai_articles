Water supply to the fields is closed after 40 days, that helps the plant grow more rapidly.\nThe SAPM said under this project, the government would provide 2700 machines on 50% subsidy to the rice producers and the subsidy would continue for 5 years.\nAfter inaugurating the project, he presided over a meeting where he was informed that Pakistan is 4th largest exporter of rice with annual export of over 4 million tons (about 2 billion USD).\nHe was informed that last year total rice area was 3.4 million hector (1.4 million ha basmati and 2.0 million ha non- basrnati) with production of 8.2 million tons (history highest (4 million tons Basrnati and 4.2 million tons non-basmati)).\nThe SAPM was told that though per acre yield has increased from 2.4 t/ha to 2.5 t/ha yet it is lower as compared to other rice producing countries (China 7.0 t/ha, Japan 7.0 t/ha, India 4.0 V.).\nA mega project for productivity enhancement of rice under Prime Minister’s National Agriculture Emerge, Program was started by end of the year 2019 with the total budget of Rs 15.789 billion.\nThe project cost is Rs 15.789 billion with federal share of Rs 3.751 billion (24%), provincial share of Rs 7.568 billion (48%), and farmers’ share of Rs 4.470 billion (28%) and the project duration is 5 year (2019-2024).\nThe basic and long term objective of the project is to increase per acre paddy yield by 10 maunds for basmati and 20 maunds for non-basmati.\nJamshed was informed that the major project interventions includes provision of rice implements on 50% subsidy (Transplanters, Drills, MB plough, Sprayers), seed distribution on 50% subsidy and demonstrations of good agricultural practices Progress.\nThe project has been started in 3 provinces (Punjab, Khyber Pukhtunkhwa and Balochistan) howesier, Sindh has not yet started the umbrella project.\nThe meeting was informed that efforts were being made to adopt transplanting through machines from 1990’s but could not be successful.
