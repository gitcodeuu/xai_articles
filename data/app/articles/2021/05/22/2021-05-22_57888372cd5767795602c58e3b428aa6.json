  "content": "LAHORE, May 22 (APP):Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain Saturday said there was no rift in the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI), which was united under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n“The PTI is a family. Misunderstanding among family members is a common thing, which is resolved through mutual consultations,” he said while talking to media persons after attending a luncheon meeting organized here by Member of the Punjab Assembly Nauman Ahmed Lagrial.\nThe minister rejected the impression, given by the opposition parties, that there was any rift in the PTI , saying their ‘dandia dance’ would hopefully come to an end now.\nDuring the meeting, Fawad said he listened to the point of view of Jehangir Tareen and his allies in detail.\nFawad said he had a close relationship with Nauman Langrial, and stressed the need of improving the coordination as the party issues could only be resolved through talks.\nThere could be differences of opinion on some issues but on greater matters all the party members were very clear as the PTI was their party, he added. “There are no two opinions in this regard.”\nThe minister said the party leadership had already a clear stance on the Jehangir Tareen issue. Neither Jahangir Tareen expected that Prime Minister Imran Khan would give any undue favour to him nor the latter was used to do so.\nHe said a committee had been formed under the leadership of Senator Ali Zafar on the Jahangir Tareen issue and its report was awaited. “This report will determine the internal line of the party.”\nAs far as the court cases were concerned, the minister said, they were legal matters and made it clear that neither the prime minister had any policy on it nor he would do anything about it, and Jahangir Tareen would also not like any such thing.\n“We are all like a family and have decided to move together,” he said, adding the decision had been taken to resolve personal and collective issues amicably.\nHe vowed to work on the task given to him, Amir Kiyani and Saif Niazi in an efficient manner.\nHe said the PTI was the only party, which had the representation in all the four provinces, and Imran Khan had a vote bank across the country.\nOn the contrary, he said, the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz was the party of Central Punjab and Pakistan Peoples Party that of interior Sindh.\nHe said elections were held on around 1,100 to 1,200 seats in the country and there was no party except the PTI to field candidates in all the constituencies.\n“We are proud to say that the PTI is a federal party,” he said, adding that minor things had been happening in the national-level party, which would be settled in a systematic way. “We will solve these issues.”\nResponding to a question, the minister said with timely action, the government had saved loss to the national exchequer in the Rawalpindi Ring Road project.\nTo another question, he said that no development funds were being issued to any members of the national or provincial assemblies.",
