But public supported my party and the government in the struggle for rule of law,” he added.\nThe event was organized by the Embassy of Pakistan in Saudi Arabia where Governor State Bank, Syed Baqir Raza, also highlighted the achievements and promise of “Roshan Digital Accounts”, launched last year, under the vision of the prime minister.\nThe prime minister further said that difference in societies was based upon–the one which had rule of law and the other governed by ‘might is right.’\nThe system based upon humanity survived and ensured prosperity whereas the rule of jungle led to nowhere, he said.\n“Those countries prospered where there is rule of law and justice,” he stressed.\nThe prime minister said the corrupt elements had been united in their efforts to save their skins.\n“No one can stop this change, due to mass awareness. Social media has brought a change as information travelled very fast. The youth and social media have been the main ingredients of our party’s success,” he opined.\nHe said the struggle continued for that Naya Pakistan which had been envisioned by its founder Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah and which must have been realized many years back.\nDue to his government’s efforts for Naya Pakistan, the country was rightly back on track and on path to its real destiny.\nAppreciating the role of about 9 million overseas Pakistanis in the prosperity of the country, he said, they possessed huge potential and had been the biggest asset.\nHe said their potential was not fully tapped and no efforts were made in the past to pursue them to invest in the country.\nThe prime minister said the country’s economy was being stabilized as they had passed through the most difficult times with consistent strengthening of its reserves.\nHe mentioned that government was making efforts to further offer the overseas Pakistanis different products like Roshan digital account because the world was changing at fast pace with the use of latest technology.\nThe prime minister lauded the overseas Pakistanis for their patriotism and contribution to the progress and development of Pakistan. Recalling his personal experience of interacting with overseas Pakistanis, spanning over three decades, he termed them an asset for Pakistan.\nHe said that the welfare and well-being of overseas Pakistanis was among the government’s top priorities.\nHe said efforts would be made to resolve their issues and nurturing their potential to the benefit of the motherland.\nThe prime minister especially appreciated the role of Pakistani expatriates in the Kingdom – largest Pakistani diaspora abroad, for the largest contribution it makes to foreign remittances of the country.\nHe urged them to utilize the special schemes, such as the Roshan Digital Accounts, which had been launched with a view to facilitate them.\nThe prime minister also encouraged the ambassador to develop close liaison with the Pakistani community in Saudi Arabia, remain aware of their needs and issues and make every effort towards addressing them.\nAbout his visit, the prime minister lauded leadership of Saudi Arabia that always supported Pakistan in the most difficult times.\nThey supported Pakistan and provided oil on deferred payment, similarly, the United Arab Emirates also supported the country, otherwise, Pakistan would have defaulted, entailing severe consequences, he observed.\nAfter Covid pandemic, the prime minister said, the fragile economies were devasted worldwide, adding in the neighbouring country, India, daily caseloads were increasing at alarming level.\nPakistan was among the few countries, which had navigated in the Covid scenario with much difficulty, he said, adding, Pakistan’s exports were on the rise and the economy had recovered.\nThe prime minister said the economic indicators of the country were  showing improvement. Construction industry was providing jobs and the low-cost housing imitative would provide housing facilities to low-income groups.\nPrior to it, there was no concept of such housing facility in Pakistan, the government was slowly and gradually unfolding such facilities.\nEarlier, Governor State Bank of Pakistan, Reza Baqir informed that so far, more than 100,000 accounts had been opened under Roshan digital initiative.\nHe said that country’s current account was now in surplus and the its reserves had surged to over 16 billion dollars.",
