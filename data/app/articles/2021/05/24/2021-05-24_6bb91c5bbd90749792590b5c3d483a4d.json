  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 24 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan Monday said that justice and welfare of masses were the two main principles of Riasat-e-Madina which could ensure progress and development of the country.\nThe prime minister was expressing his views during a meeting with Chairman of Council of Islamic Ideology  (CII) Dr Qibla Ayaz and other council members who called on him here. Minister for Religious Affairs Pir Noorul Haq Qadri, Minister of State for Information Farrukh Habib, PM’s Special Assistant Dr Shahbaz Gill and PM’s special representative Maulana Tahir Ashrafi were also present in the meeting.\nDuring the meeting, the prime minister underlined the CII’s important role in realizing the ideals of state of Madina.\nThe prime minister regretted that the West had adopted these principles and achieved progress because justice prevailed there and no one was regarded as above law.\nIn Pakistan, no leader had ever thought of transforming the country into a real Islamic welfare state, he added.\nThe prime minister said that he entered into politics to serve the poor under the principles of Riasat-e-Madina.\nHe said that he knew the West very well and reached to the conclusion that by following the basic guiding principles of Islam and the Sunnah of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), Pakistan could be transformed into a welfare and developed country.\nThe prime minister observed that the western values had been different, whereas the country’s youth required guidance in this regard and referred to the role of CII which could be very helpful.\nHe further said Islam had given rights to womenfolk and strength to the weaker segments of society.\nBy following the guiding principles of Islam, a justice system could be enforced helping them to get rid of corruption, he added.\nThe prime minister noted that realization of state of Madina was a continuous struggle in which role of all segments of society including religious leaders would be very significant.\nThe CII chairman and members lauded the prime minister for effectively raising voice for the Tahafaz-e-Namoos-e-Risalat (SAW), building narrative against Islamophobia, and for the rights of the people of Kashmir and Palestine.",
