  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 24 (APP): Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) on Monday directed Cellular Mobile Operators (CMOs) to send mandatory confirmation messages to their consumers to get explicit consent for opting in or activation of Value Added Services.\nCMOs have further been directed to submit compliance report within three weeks from issuance of the order, said a news release issued here.\nPTA has issued these orders after receiving consumers’ complaints that Value Added Services (VAS), including Third Party Content/games, were sometimes activated by mobile operators without prior consent of consumers.\nPTA has taken serious notice of such complaints as activation of any Value Added Services without explicit consent of consumers is violation of Clause 9 (3) (vii) of “Telecom Consumers Protection Regulations, 2009”.\nThis step is expected to provide great relief to mobile consumers. PTA is committed to protect the interests of users of telecommunication services in Pakistan.",
