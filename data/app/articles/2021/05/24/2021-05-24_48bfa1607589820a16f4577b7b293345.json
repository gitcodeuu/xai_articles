  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 24 (APP): Adviser to Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Dr Babar Awan on Monday said Prime Minister Imran Khan did not believe in vendetta against political opponents.\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government under dynamic leadership of the prime minister was effectively working for the development and welfare of the country and masses, he remarked while talking to a private news channel.\nHe said nobody could dislodge the incumbent government and it would complete its constitutional term with the support of the public.\nPTI would win the upcoming general elections on basis of its outstanding performance and prudent policies initiated during the ongoing tenure, he stated.\nDr Babar said all the national institutions were working independently under their domains to put the country on the path of economic and political stability.\nReplying to a question, he said the leadership of Pakistan Peoples’ Party (PPP) and Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) had registered corruption cases against each other during their regimes. Undocumented accounts were opened during the tenure of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, he claimed.\nThe adviser urged Nawaz Sharif to comeback the country and faced the laundering cases instead of enjoying luxurious lives at abroad.",
