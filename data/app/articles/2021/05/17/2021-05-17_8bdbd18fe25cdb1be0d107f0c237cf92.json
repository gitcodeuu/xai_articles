  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 17 (APP): Minister for Interior Sheikh Rashid Ahmed on Monday said the name of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) president, Shehbaz Sharif had been placed on the Exit Control List (ECL) after the approval of federal cabinet.\nA sub-committee of the federal cabinet had recommended to place Shehbaz’s name on the ECL last week following request of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), the minister told journalists here.\nAddressing a press conference, he said Shehbaz Sharif could not travel abroad after his name being placed on the ECL as he was facing multiple corruption references filed by the NAB.\nAs the United Kingdom (UK) has imposed a travel ban on Pakistan, Shehbaz was supposed to fly via Qatar for London, he informed.\n“Five people from Sharif family are on the run after the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case. If Shehbaz leaves now he will never return just like his brother, ” the minister observed.\nThe minister said all the co-accused in NAB reference were already placed on ECL, adding that ” If Shehbaz wants he can file a review petition within 15 days.”\nThe case against Shehbaz Sharif involved a colossal sum of over Rs.7 billion, therefore like his brother [Nawaz Sharif] if he absconded his extradition from the UK would not be possible, he added.\nThe PML-N president, he said had breached his undertaking as a guarantor in the past to the Lahore High Court that he would bring his brother back to the country.\nHe said no data was available with the ministry from which it could be assessed that Shehbaz Sharif required medical treatment which was not available in the country.\nThe minister noted that opposition can do no harm to Imran Khan as he was focused on his mission to bring country out of crisis.\nTo a query, Rashid said the entire Islamic world was mourning over the situation in Gaza, adding that a resolution would be tabled in the National Assembly to discuss the prevailing tense situation in Palestine.\nThe civil and military leadership were on the same page and playing due role for country’s progress and prosperity, he said in response to another question.\nHe praised the role of China for convening United Nations Security Council meeting over the Israel-Palestine conflict.",
