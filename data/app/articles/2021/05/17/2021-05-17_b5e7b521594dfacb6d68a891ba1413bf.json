  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 17 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain Monday said it was unfortunate that the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Maryam Nawaz was following the same irresponsible attitude adopted by the Indian politicians during the Uttar Pradesh election campaign that caused COVID-19 (coronavirus) crisis in India.\n“If today, people in India are lying helpless on roads because there is no space in its hospitals that run out of the oxygen beds.\nThe main reason of reaching this stage was the irresponsible attitude of politicians there, where in Uttar Pradesh election campaign the Coronavirus SOPs were massively violated. Now here [in Pakistan], Maryam has the same attitude,” he tweeted.\nThe minister also shared a video clip of Maryam Nawaz’s address to a public gathering in Sheikhupura where she flouted the anti-COVID Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).\nاگر ہندوستان میں لوگ سڑکوں پر بے آسرا پڑے ہیں تو اس لئے کہ ہسپتالوں میں جگہ نہیں آکسیجن بیڈز ختم ہو چکے ہیں اس حالت میں پہنچنے کی بڑی وجہ وہاں کے سیاستدانوں کا غیر ذمہ دارانہ رویہ تھا جہاں اتر پردیش الیکشن مہم میں #CoronaSOP کی دھجیاں اڑا دی گئیں یہاں اب یہی رویہ مریم نواز کا ہے pic.twitter.com/FdAdLHv4MT\n— Ch Fawad Hussain (@fawadchaudhry) May 17, 2021\nFawad sympathized with the people of India, but lashed out at the Indian government over its failure to handle the corona situation in its country that put the whole region at risk.\n“Indian Government handling of #Corona has created an international crisis, whole region is now suffering because of #HugeIndianFailure to face the challenge, prayers are with people of India but irresponsible decision making of Indian leaders have now endangered even neighbours,” he said in another tweet.\nIndian Government handling of #Corona has created an international crisis, whole region is now suffering because of #HugeIndianFailure to face the challenge, prayers are with people of India but irresponsible decision making of Indian leaders have now endangered even neighbours",
