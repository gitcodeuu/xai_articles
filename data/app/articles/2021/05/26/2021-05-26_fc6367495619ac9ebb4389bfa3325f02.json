They are youngsters,” he added.\nThe minister said that technology had changed the whole world and the countries that followed the changes had started emerging and moving towards the road of progress, prosperity, and development.\nHe advised the youth to increase their knowledge and gain awareness from the world.\nThe minister said that the most important thing of the Successful Youth Programme was that it was creating employment opportunities, from which farmers, peoples associated with livestock and other sectors could benefit.\nFawad congratulated the participants of the successful youth programme on completing the course.\nHe said Special Assistant to Prime Minister Usman Dar on Youth Affairs and Vice-Chancellor Bahria University deserved congratulations for the success of this programme.\n“It is a game-changer programme, the success of this programme is the success of Pakistan and our youth,” he added.",
