I tried to release the bird but it was hanging over a distance of 15 feet and it was not possible to reach there and it left all my efforts in vain.”\nJabir said after making futile efforts he called Rescue 1122 to help rescue the bird where the staff along with a fire rescue vehicle and ambulance reached the spot within five minutes of his phone call.\nThe team efficiently set its vehicle and rescued the bird that was released after removing kite string from his neck and wings and was also given first aid.\nThe team members comprising Rizwan, Umer, Hamid, Zahad and Bashir amicably handled the bird and released it free after providing first aid as the bird revived to normal condition.\nIt may be mentioned here that Rescue 1122 other than providing rescue, relief and life support facilities to humans have also been providing services to protect wild species, stray dogs, cats and even snakes reported in homes of rural areas of the garrison city.\nAn official of Rescue 1122 told that they have rescued around 10 snakes of local species found in the households of Chakri and Dhamial areas.",
