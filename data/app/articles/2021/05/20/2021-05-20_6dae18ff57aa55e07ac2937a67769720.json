He said if developed, the province could give the fastest return besides guaranteeing country’s safe future as well as strong federation.\nThe prime minister, who earlier unveiled the plaque to launch construction work of Rs 5.7 billion road project, said having inherited the biggest ever debt burden and fiscal deficit, the first year of his government was passed to ensure country’s financial survival and avert default.\nDuring the second year, it faced the COVID-19 crisis, through the country was lucky to sail through it successfully by maintaining a balance between the lives and the livelihood, unlike the neighboring country India. He hoped the country would also overcome the third wave provided the people observed precautions particularly the use of masks.\nReiterating his government’s vision of uplifting the neglected areas, the prime minister committed that they would develop record number of roads in Balochistan during their five years term.\nHe said a nation aspiring to make progress must achieve the uplift of its poor population and ensure rule of law just like China which steered 700 million people out of poverty and jailed over 400 ministerial level people for corruption.\nThe prime minister recounted his government’s welfare schemes and reforms like Sehat Insaf Card for entire population of Punjab and KP provinces, shelter homes, mobile kitchens to serve the residents of poor localities, uniform education curriculum and legal reforms to ensure disposal of property cases within a year.\nHe said following the incentives by the government, the industrial sector was witnessing boom after five years. Similarly the farmers have earned additional Rs 1100 billion after they got reasonable support prices for wheat, sugarcane and rice. The increased income of farmers was also evidenced in form of record sale of tractors and motorcycles.\nThe prime minister told the gathering that after compilation of data, the government would provide direct subsidy to the deserving population in case of any price hike of wheat, sugar or electricity.\nCommunications Minister Murad Saeed also addressed the event and highlighted the his ministry’s achievements and future road projects to be launched during this year.\nEarlier, in his briefing, NHA Chairman Khurram Agha said the 103-kilometer road would cost Rs5.7 billion and take two years to complete. It would create around 3,600 jobs besides improving connectivity to Iran and improving socio-economic condition of the area.",
