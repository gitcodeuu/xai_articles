  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 19 (APP): Pakistan and China will soon have a new and alternative short road connectivity as an alternative to China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) which would be constructed by Pakistan at the cost of Rs 50 billion.\nThe new route funded by the Pakistani government, will be in addition to the Shandur route connecting to China under the CPEC and will help expedite the pace of economic development between the two countries. The route would be around 350 kilometers shorter than the existing via Khunjerab pass.\nIn an official letter written to Gilgit Baltistan’s Works Department (GBWD), it has been asked to prepare a concept clearance proposal for new route which would pass through Shigar, Skardu and Astor districts and connect to Muzaffarabad district of Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK).\nMoreover, the concerned departments in these districts have also been asked to submit the concept clearance proposals for construction of a 33 feet wide truck friendly road from Yarkand at China border to Gorikot in Astor via Shagarthang.\nThis has come after Prime Minister Imran Khan’s announcement of a historic development package for Gilgit Baltistan.\nThe federal government has also included 216-kilometre Shandur-Gilgit road into the Rs 370 billion package.\nThe Planning Development and Special Initiatives Department said the Rs 50 billion road is being considered as an alternative route to CPEC and would be completed under the umbrella of the Integrated GB Development Plan 2021-26. The original cost of the road was estimated to be Rs 45 billion which has not been enhanced to Rs 50 billion.\nThe project’s PC-1 has been submitted to the Planning Commission for subsequent approval from Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC).\nThe Ministry of Communication had already submitted PC-1 of the project to Ministry of Planning Development and Special Initiatives for consideration in upcoming Central Development Working Party (CDWP) and Executive Committee of National Economic Council (ECNEC) meeting.\nThe new road would be an all-weather road, providing an alternative route to CPEC during winter when the Silk Route is closed due to snowfall. After Lowari Tunnel, the project will be another top notch and time saving route for traveling to the region. The total length of the road is 363km, of which 216 km are in GB’s territory.",
