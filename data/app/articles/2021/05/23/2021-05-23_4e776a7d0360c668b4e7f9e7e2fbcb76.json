This growth rate will increase further in the next two years, Inshallah, he added.\nCriticism of the opposition’s economic development meant merely creating political chaos and instability in the country, he said and added that opposition feared that Prime Minister Imran Khan would get more victories in the next election and their political drama would be stopped.",
