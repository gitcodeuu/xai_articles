In 2019, Pakistan met the 15 percent benchmark set by the UN Secretariat in the staff/officers category.\nEven, a team of Pakistani officers was presently serving as the first all-female group from Pakistan in a UN peacekeeping mission, deployed in the Democratic Republic of Congo, providing a range of resources to the region including psychologists, stress counsellors, vocational training officers, gender advisors, doctors, nurses, operations officers, information officers, and logistics officers.\nHe said Pakistan’s contribution to peacekeeping on the ground had been complemented by its active engagement at the level of policy formulation in various UN bodies.\nPakistan brings a unique perspective to peacekeeping, not only as a leading troop contributing country, but also as the host to one of the oldest peacekeeping missions in the world – the UN Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).",
