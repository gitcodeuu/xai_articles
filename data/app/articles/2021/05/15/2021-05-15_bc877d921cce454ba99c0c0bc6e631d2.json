She said the PML-N leadership must remember that the practice of so called Khadim-e-Aala for increasing bank balance through fictitious telegraphic transfers have been exposed.\nShe alleged that PML-N governments broke all records of corruption and plundering of public money in development projects and those secrets are now open and known to everybody. She said the PTI government made public the inquiry report of Rawalpindi Ring Road project to expose their corruption before the public.\nShe said immediate action would be taken against those responsible for irregularities and corruption in the project and they would be brought to justice.\nShe claimed that nobody could raise a finger on the character and transparency of Prime Minister Imran Khan and Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar.",
