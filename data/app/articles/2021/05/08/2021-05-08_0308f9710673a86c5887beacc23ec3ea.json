G. Jung on Nature, Technology and Modern Life,” the president said was one of the first to show humans callous destruction of nature.\nPlease follow SOPs very diligently.We will have an edge over other countries because we showed discipline. Pray in Ramadan. Read. @aminattock gave me a book ‘The Earth Has a Soul’ on psychoanalyst Carl Gustaf Jung 1875-1961 One of the 1st to show our callous destruction of nature\n— Dr. Arif Alvi (@ArifAlvi) May 8, 2021\nJung believed that loss of emotional participation in Nature has resulted in a sense of cosmic and social isolation.”\nHe said the man lacked the conscious recognition of his inferiority to nature around him and within him. “He must learn that he may not do exactly as he wills. If he does not learn this, his own nature will destroy him.”",
