In the last 26 days, he has summited two 8000m peaks,” he added.\nAccording to Secretary ACP, Sirbaz is on the mission to become the first Pakistani to climb world’s all 14 above 8000m peaks.\n“It is wonderful that our mountaineers are making history, exhibiting great strength and courage,” he reckoned.\nLast month, Sirbaz along with Muhammad Abdul Joshi, another Pakistan mountaineer climbed the 8,091-metre Annapurna peak in Nepal, becoming the first Pakistan duo to achieve the feat. “He [Sirbaz] has achieved half of his target now. Hopefully, we will soon see him climbing the rest of the highest peaks too,” Haidri added.\nThe 32-year-old Sirbaz, who hails from Aliabad, Hunza, began his climbing career in 2016. Prior to Mount Everest and Annapurna, he has ascended K2, Nanga Parbat, Broad Peak, Lhotse, and Manaslu.",
