Under tier-1, loan limit was from Rs100, 000 to Rs1 million, for which mark up rate was only 3 per cent, he added.\nUsman Dar said the government was planning to add another tier of Rs 100,000 to Rs 500,000 by June end as most of the applications were received for this type of loans under the YES. The mark rate for such type of loans would be only two per cent, he added.\nFor success of this tier, he said micro-financing institutions would be engaged to reach out the youth in the less developed areas such as Balochistan, tribal areas and others.\nThe SAPM urged the National Skill University students to apply for loan under the YES, vowing to make a dedicated dashboard for them.\nHe said an application was being developed in collaboration with the National Information Technology Board to ensure two-way communication between youth and the teams of Kamayab Jawan Programme and the associated banks.\nUsman Dar said a virtual job portal had been developed to facilitate the youth in exploring employment opportunities both domestic and international. It would enable both the applicants and employers to interact with each other, he added.\nHe said the portal was being run by the NACTTC on test-run basis.",
