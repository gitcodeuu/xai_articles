  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 27 (APP):Head of Department at the Air University, Islamabad, Dr Adil Sultan on Thursday reiterated that there remain several shades of grey in India’s nuclear developments as its policies remain in stark contrast.\nHe was speaking at a webinar hosted by the Center for Strategic and Contemporary Research (CSCR) on ‘A Greater Role of Nuclear Weapons in India’s General Defence’. He said that Indian leadership avoids disarmament treaties.\nWhile answering a question he said that Pakistan has more clarity regarding its nuclear posture than India.\nSpeaking at the webinar was also Dr. Frank O’Donnell, a Stimson Center Non-resident Fellow. He affirmed that Indian nuclear policies hold uncertainties.\nDr. Rabia Akhtar, Director at the Center for Security, Strategy and Policy Research said, “Several current and retired Indian officers have made statements regarding India ditching the No First Use (NFU)”.\nThe increasing involvement of nuclear assets in India’s defence strategy will trigger serious conflict and a cycle of escalation. Wrong signaling can lead to dangerous miscalculations and can temper with stability in South Asia, Dr. Akhtar stressed.",
