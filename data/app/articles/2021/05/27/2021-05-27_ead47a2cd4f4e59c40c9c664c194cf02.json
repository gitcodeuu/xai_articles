  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 27 (APP): Pakistan on Thursday categorically rejected India’s allegations of cross-border infiltration, saying the movement against illegal occupation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) was indigenous.\n“The movement against the Indian occupation and its state-sponsored terrorism in IIOJK is indigenous and is likely to continue till India decides to act in accordance with the UNSC resolutions, mandating a free and impartial plebiscite in the occupied territory,” the Foreign Office Spokesperson said.\nThe statement of Spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Janjua was issued in response to media queries regarding the comments made by Indian External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar at the Hoover Institution on Wednesday.\nThe Spokesperson said peace and security in the region was threatened on account of India’s brutalization of Kashmiri people.\nHe mentioned India’s refusal to resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the United Nations Security Council Resolutions and its pledges to the international community and the Kashmiris.\n“India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019 in IIOJK are against international law and manifestly anti-peace,” he said.\nThe Spokesperson said since 1947, the Jammu and Kashmir dispute continued to be the core outstanding issue between Pakistan and India, awaiting settlement as per international legitimacy.\n“Rather than regurgitating insinuations against Pakistan, India will be well advised to create enabling environment for a meaningful and result-oriented engagement for resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute as well as any other issues,” the FO Spokesperson concluded.",
