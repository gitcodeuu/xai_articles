He remarked that the petitioner had gone abroad and then came back in past.\nHowever, the law officer submitted that he needed some time for consultation as officials had gone due to long holidays. The law officer also read out affidavit given by Shehbaz Sharif while leaving with Nawaz Sharif to London earlier.
