This is one such moment. We must not fail the Palestinian people at this critical juncture,” the foreign minister said on Twitter following his virtual address the Emergency Meeting of the Executive Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to discuss Israel’s aggression against Palestine.\nThe foreign minister, while briefing media about the OIC meeting, thanked Saudi Arabia for convening the emergency session where he represented the sentiments of the Pakistani nation as per the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nCalling the Israeli atrocities highly condemnable, the foreign minister said human rights were being violated in Palestine.\nThe Palestinian people were targeted even during Holy Ramazan and the violence on women and children was intolerable.\nReferring to the Israeli attack on media houses, the foreign minister said in this era of social media, it was impossible to cover up the truth.\nReiterating Pakistan’s resolve to raise the voice against Israeli aggression at every forum, Qureshi called for the role of international community to stop the Israeli aggression.\nForeign Minister Qureshi also apprised media of his telephonic interactions with Palestinian and Chinese counterparts and scheduled interaction with US Secretary of State on Sunday evening.\nHe said as per the vision of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Palestine issue was defining principle of Pakistan’s foreign policy and assured that the country would never leave the Palestinian people alone.\nAt the OIC meeting, the foreign minister told the Muslim world that the indiscriminate use of force by Israeli forces against defenceless Palestinians defied all international laws.\nThe tragedy of forced evictions of Palestinians from Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood of Al-Quds Al-Shareef was the latest manifestation of systematic Israeli effort to change demographic structure, historical and legal status, and Arab-Islamic / Christian character of Al-Quds Al-Shareef.\nThe foreign minister said creating false equivalence between Israel, the aggressor and Palestinians, the victims, was inexcusable.\nQureshi said OIC owed genesis to Palestinian issue and the Muslim Ummah must exhibit strong solidarity for people of Palestine with action.",
