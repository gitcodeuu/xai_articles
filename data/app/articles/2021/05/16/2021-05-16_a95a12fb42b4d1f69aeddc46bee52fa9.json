More importantly, it had effectively created the launch pad for a directional shift of the economy towards sustainable growth, Malik Amin highlighted.\nGive the backdrop, the COVID-19 crisis extended an opportunity and Pakistan seized it to break out of the depression and reinvigorate an ailing economy with a “Green Stimulus” initiative with two objectives: protecting nature and creating green jobs, the PM’s aide said.\nFor financing the Green Stimulus, the climate change ministry envisioned three phases, all of which now in place with specialised funding options, Malik Amin highlighted.\nSpelling out the details, he said first ongoing phase was fully funded through “self budgetary provisions”, which had to be recalibrated and prioritised towards green job creation.\nAs a result, the purely government financed activities, amounting to Rs10 billion have already delivered 85,000 daily wage green jobs across the country in nursery raising, plant care, protection of natural forests and fire fighting activities and we have further planned to raise this to 200,000 daily wage jobs within the next few months.\nFor the second phase, the post-COVID-19 recovery, a new platform “Ecosystem Restoration Fund” was also launched to allow willing partners (public and private) to credibly and transparently join Pakistan’s green recovery, he said.\nMoreover, substantial support funds of $180 million have been secured through multi-lateral partners (led by the World Bank) proving that if the right plan was in place with full ownership, the funds could always be generated, he added.\nMalik Amin said further that despite all odds, the country’s first institutional National Parks Service was now underway, targeting 5,000 nature jobs to be generated for youth people who will be trained to become guardians and custodians of nature.\nThe PM’s aide stressed, “This nature-positive pathway to rebuild the economy and stimulate sustainable growth, while employing young people, is a pressing need and will allow the country to not only come out of the economic recession but also build back better and build back green.”",
