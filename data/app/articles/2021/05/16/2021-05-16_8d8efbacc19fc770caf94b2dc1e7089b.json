He stressed an effective monitoring system for timely utilisation of development funds.\nHe directed the officers concerned to personally monitor the progress of development schemes and asked them to focus on the standard and quality of the development schemes.\nBuzdar said the time of lip service had passed. “The PTI government, during its two-and-a-half years tenure, has rectified the mistakes of the previous governments.\nThe rulers of previous regimes utilised the funds of southern Punjab for development and progress of other areas. The PTI government has launched real development projects, instead of showy schemes,” he added.\nHe said former rulers intentionally kept the people of southern Punjab backward and pushed them below the poverty line.\nThey fooled and hoodwinked the people of southern Punjab in the name of development. The PTI government has returned the right to development and progress to the people of southern Punjab and the setting up of the Southern Punjab Secretariat was an open proof of that, he added.\nHe said that from now onwards, the Annual Development Programme of southern Punjab would be prepared separately.\nHe said that the budget of southern Punjab would be\nwould be utilised only in that region.\nThese projects would provide relief to the people of the province and accelerate the process of economic development, he promised.",
