Internal and external audits are key functions to ensure financial control and transparency.\nTo this end, there are several audit related indicators being tracked by the observatory to ensure audits are conducted regularly and reports are presented to the board.\nThe governance observatory also monitors organizational risks and tracks, if appropriate risk mitigation systems are in place. This also includes risks associated with usage of information technology systems, especially data governance.\nMoreover, the observatory actively monitors business operations practices to make sure that effective HR policies needed for the functioning of these organizations in place.\nSpecifically, the governance observatory tracks the following indicators: required board meetings conducted in the last 12 months; board committee meeting minutes for the past year circulated, internal audit report for the last fiscal year presented to the board; risk based internal audit plan for the next fiscal year presented to the board; AGP audit report for the last fiscal year presented to the board; external audit report for the last fiscal year presented to the board; error fraud corruption report for the last quarter presented to the board; error fraud corruption cases reported and resolved in the last 12 months; conflict of Interest policy approved by the board; conflict of interest cases reported and resolved in the last 12 months; latest risk register, including proof of submission to the board; IT security policy in place approved by the board; IT audit conducted in the past year; whistle blowing policy approved by the board; whistle blowing cases reported and resolved in last 12 months; employee conduct rules approved by the board; gender harassment cases reported and resolved in the last 12 months; and procurement manual approved by the board.",
