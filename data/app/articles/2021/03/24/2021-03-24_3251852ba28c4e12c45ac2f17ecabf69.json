  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 24 (APP):Federal Minister for Interior Sheikh Rashid Ahmed Wednesday said that the ministry has approved deployment of Rangers outside the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) Lahore office on Punjab government’s request.\nAddressing a news conference, he said the Punjab government had requested the federal government to maintain law and order in the provincial capital ahead of Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) vice president Maryam Nawaz appearance before the NAB, on Friday (March 26).\nThe minister clarified that the Punjab police would lead from the front in providing security to the NAB’s Lahore office.\nEarlier, the NAB, Lahore sought foolproof security from the Law Enforcement Agencies including Punjab police and Rangers to protect its building from the PML-N goons.\nThe NAB also asked the authorities concerned to declare its Lahore office ‘red zone’ after the PML-N directed to its political leadership to accompany Maryam during her appearing before the anti-graft watchdog.\nHe said PML-N vice president intends to secure interim bail from Lahore High Court ahead of her hearing and at the same time, convincing people to gather outside NAB on March 26.\n“A genuine political leader do not use workers as a shield rather lead them from the front.” said the minster.\nHe said, PML-N’s show of power outside NAB office is not for the government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf but to pressurize the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP).\nThe opposition’s moves had always provided political benefits to Prime Minister Imran Khan, he maintained.\nHe noted that both the parties PPP and PML-N had always dug political pit falls for each others and there were many instances in that regard. Now, they disagreed with each others over the selection of leader of the opposition in the Senate.\nCriticizing the Pakistan Democratic Movement chief, he said Maulana Fazlur Rehman’s political career has come to an end and now he had become a rolling stone between the PML-N and PPP.\nThe Interior minister made a passionate appeal to the masses to refrain from participating in any public gathering as Lahore had witnessed a spike in the corona virus cases with 14 percent positivity rate.\nInterior Minister Sheikh Rashid said so far over 300,000 applications for E-visa have been received that included 100,000 of Afghans and 80,000 from China.\nHe said the interior ministry has finalized a plan to set up a media city for providing accommodations to the journalist community. Their unions from twin cities of Rawalpindi and Islamabad were intimated to provide a list of those workers who had no residence so far, he added.\nThe minister said directives have already been given to Capital Development Authority Chairman Aamer Ali Ahmed in this regard. The chairman office would start receiving applications by second half of the holy month of Ramazan.\nTo a query, Sheikh Rashid said he himself received jab of the SinoPharm’s vaccine to dispel the disinformation about the coronavirus vaccination.\n“No matter how hard the PML-N tries, PPP will never opt for en mass resignation,” he said in response to another question.",
