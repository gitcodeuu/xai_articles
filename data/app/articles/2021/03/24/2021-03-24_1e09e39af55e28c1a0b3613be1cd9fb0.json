Only when we understand that intricate balance of nature, would we value its services to us.\nShe further emphasized that every citizen should pledge to plant a tree to tackle the imminent impacts of climate change.

But this wildlife is facing threats due to habitat loss and conflict with humans.\nBesides that, Pakistan also faces a myriad of environmental issues and is highly vulnerable to climate change and extreme weather events such as floods, landslides, glacial lake outbursts floods (GLOFs), cloud bursts, sea-level rise, and cyclones. Public figures such as Ushna Shah can set an example for the masses and can encourage them to contribute towards a healthier planet.\nWWF-Pakistan hopes that Ushna Shah will help in raising environmental awareness in Pakistan, highlighting the need to take ownership of our natural resources, curb illegal hunting, plant indigenous trees, reduce their use of plastics and promote other conservation efforts.\n“I also hope that Pakistanis develop empathy with nature and everything that it holds,” Ushna Shah added.",
