Allah knows till how long we will have to do this,” he said.\nCalling the COVID-19 a deadly disease, the president said it affected the elderly more than others and it could only be tackled through precautions.\nDespite vaccination, we still have to take precautions. My dear brothers, sister, elders & young, we have to ensure that we remain successful in countering Covid-19. The government, media, ulema, and all of you have done a splendid job. Please continue. https://t.co/IetueAxcDV\n— Dr. Arif Alvi (@ArifAlvi) March 15, 2021\nThe president said he found the system very easy and viewed that the mechanism of calling the people proactively had also avoided crowd at the center, though the government had sufficient stock of the medicine available.\nLater on Twitter, the president expressed satisfaction over the vaccination process and urged the countrymen to get vaccinated without any hesitation.\nHe said the vaccination was never meant to do away with the precautionary measures rather it was meant to give further protection.\n“Despite vaccination, we still have to take precautions. My dear brothers, sister, elders & young, we have to ensure that we remain successful in countering Covid-19. The government, media, ulema, and all of you have done a splendid job. Please continue,” he said.\nPresident Alvi recalled that Imran Khan was the only leader who had resisted the call of blanket lockdown by all including experts  but he went for smart lockdown just to avert the hunger-related deaths. The idea was later endorsed globally by many others, he added.\nHe said the country kept the mosques opened and also observed Eid festivals with precautions and recognized the sacrifices by the doctors.\n“Pakistan’s success is that… we fought the first wave, the second one and it is essential to fight the third wave too. The precaution is direly needed. Keep wearing mask. Pakistan will bring it under control,” he hoped.",
