In reply to a question about awarding Senate tickets, he said: “We can not provide tickets to each and every person wishing to contest Senate elections because of limited number of seats.\n” It was obvious that some party members would have reservation, he remarked. Criticizing the PDM’s agenda of long march, he said Opposition parties could not achieve success in their sinister designs of derailing the system and in future, he added these political parties would face defeat.",
