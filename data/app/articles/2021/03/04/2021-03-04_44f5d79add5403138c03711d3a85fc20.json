Pakistan wants peace and prosperity in the region. The nation salutes the sacrifices of the martyrs of the Pakistan Navy, he added.\nThe Governor Punjab said Pakistan Navy is a source of pride for 220 million Pakistanis, adding that Pakistan Navy is playing a crucial role in achieving national economic interests by defending the country’s maritime boundaries as well as providing security at Gwadar Port and CPEC sea routes.\n“We are also proud of the fact that whenever India has done any violation of Pakistan territorial waters, the Pakistan Navy has always given a befitting response and reduced India’s pride to dust,” he added.\nChaudhry Sarwar said that Pakistan has the best armed forces in the world who are always ready to sacrifice their lives for the protection of the country’s borders and have always given a befitting response to the country’s adversaries.\nHe said Pakistan is capable of defending every single inch of its borders. Pakistan’s Armed Forces and people have rendered historic sacrifices to stamp out terrorism and establish peace in the region.\nChaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the government has taken historic steps to strengthen institutions and is pursuing a policy of purging all institutions of political interference, adding that the government is implementing all measures to eradicate corruption and money laundering from the country.\nReplying to questions regarding national and international affairs, the Governor Punjab said Prime Minister Imran Khan has been advocating peace and friendly relations with all the neighbouring countries.\nHe said Pakistan is playing a positive role in peace in Afghanistan as well.
