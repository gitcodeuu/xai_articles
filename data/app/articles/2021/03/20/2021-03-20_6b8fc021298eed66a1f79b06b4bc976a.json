Countries and elements who used to support terrorist groups, individuals and organisations must be held accountable.\nExtremism and terrorism on the behalf of Islam was an oppression, which Muslim countries must handle with mutual unity and stability.\nSome 80,000 Pakistanis have sacrificed their lives in the war against terrorism, he said and added that, today, with praise of Allah Almighty, Pakistan has overcome the menace of Terrorism.\nAshrafi said that the visit of the leaders of the Gulf countries to Pakistan and the visit of Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi to Egypt have given a new impetus to relations between Pakistan and Arab Islamic Countries.\nThe Government was making continued efforts to promote and strengthen economic, religious, cultural and tourism relations instead of seeking debt an aid, he remarked.\nTo a question, he said that the role of the Emir of Kuwait in the reconciliation process between the Arab countries was commendable. The Emir and the Prime Minister of Kuwait have invited the Prime Minister Imran Khan to visit Kuwait and Pakistan leadership is also looking forward to meet the Emir of Kuwait and the Prime Minister of Kuwait, said Ashrafi.\nEfforts to resolve the visa issue and enhancing cooperation with Kuwait in various fields was major success and practical undertaking of the government’s successful foreign policy.\nHe said that the visa issue between Pakistan and Kuwait was being resolved after nine years adding that both of the countries are moving towards mutual understanding.\nResponding to a question, he said the solution to the confrontation between Pakistan and India was to resolve the Kashmir issue.\nPakistan does not want war but Pakistan has the capability to respond to any aggression, said Ashrafi.\n“Our armed forces as well as the nation believe in faith, piety and Jehad for the sake of Allah,” he said.\nIndian intelligence agencies had planned to assassinate key Pakistani clerics and religious scholars, which has been foiled by the Pakistan’s security agencies successfully.\nAshrafi said that there was no question of recognizing Israel. Pakistan will accept the same solution of Kashmir and Palestine as accepted by Palestinians and Kashmiris.\nHe said that Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) was a very strong forum of Arab countries and Pakistan has strong ties with GCC and this relationship will be further strengthened in future.",
