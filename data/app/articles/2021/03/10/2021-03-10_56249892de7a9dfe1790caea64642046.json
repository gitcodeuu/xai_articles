The peril persists however, and there remains, no room for complacency.\nIt is important that at this juncture, UK health authorities guidelines are followed in letter and spirit. The vaccines afford a safe and proven method for preventing the spread of the disease. I therefore urge you once again to cooperate with the authorities and get yourselves and your dependents inoculated soonest possible.”\nHe stressed the need to avoid non-essential air travel, particularly international travel, in line with UK guidelines. At this point in time, I would strongly urge not to travel abroad, unless unavoidable.\n“By acting with caution, complying with guidelines and exercising restraint now, we would be helping save precious lives, and assisting in bringing a closure to this pandemic.”",
