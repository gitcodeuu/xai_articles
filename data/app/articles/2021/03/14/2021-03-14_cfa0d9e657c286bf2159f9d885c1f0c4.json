The message of Islam was not spread through violence but through love, respect and affection.\nAshrafi said the agreement inked with the Madaris- e-Arabia for conventional education would be fully implemented.\nAshrafi stated that the government has recognized the Madaris education at the official level.The issues of Madaris students were being addressed and from next year, the credentials of all seminaries affiliated to the federation will be recognized by all the institutions of the country.\nResponding to a question, he said that action will be taken, whatever happened in Aurat March against the constitutional and legal values of Pakistan and all the responsible elements would be dealt in accordance with the law, adding that the organizers of the women’s march were dissociating themselves from the slogans and pamphlets of Blasphemy raised in Aurat March.\nThe Interior Ministry has been asked to conduct investigation so that the real situation comes to light in this regard.\n“We will not allow anyone to misuse the blasphemy law and thorough investigations will be held on the controversial slogans raised allegedly in Aurat March.”\nResponding to a question, The nation has witnessed how the buying and selling took place in the Senate elections that if the defeat of Hafeez Sheikh was right then the defeat of Yousuf Raza Gilani was also right.\nAshrafi said that ‘Pakistan Khapay’ was not a slogan, it was part of the faith of Pakistanis.\nIt was unfortunate that a member of the National Assembly used very inappropriate words.The nation will held accountable such elements soon.\nHafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi was also flanked by Maulana Asad Zakaria Qasmi, Maulana Noman Hashir Maulana Tahir Aqeel Awan, Maulana Hafeez-ur-Rehman, Mufti Nasir, Maulana Abu Bakar Hameed Sabri, Maulana Ilyas Muslim, Maulana Ehsan Ahmad Hussaini, Maulana Qasim Qasmi and other scholars who addressed the gathering.",
