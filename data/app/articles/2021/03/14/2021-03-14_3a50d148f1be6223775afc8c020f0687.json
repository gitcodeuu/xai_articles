It could be a matter of life or death,” the IG said in a statement issued here.\nHe further informed that police emergency department 15 was playing an important role in receiving and transmitting calls from public.\nBut, unfortunately it received approximately 2700 fake calls each day that not only waste the time of operator but may cause delay in responding to an emergency situation, he observed.\nThe IG also directed 15 authorities to book the frequent callers and proceed legal action against them to avoid such happenings in the future.",
