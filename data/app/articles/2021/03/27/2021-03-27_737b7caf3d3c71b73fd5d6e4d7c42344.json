Only in 12 days, the number has increased by 1000, he informed.\nAsad Umar warned that if the ratio of COVID -19 patients continued with the same pace, within next few days it would may cross the highest level reported in the first wave.\nHe asked people to take care of themselves and their families as well as friends.\nOn the occasion, the chairman NCOC also conferred on Covid vaccine certificates to two healthcare workers after opening of online immunization certificate portal.",
