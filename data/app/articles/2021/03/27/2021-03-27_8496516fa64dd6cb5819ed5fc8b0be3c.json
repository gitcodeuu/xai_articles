  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 27 (APP): Parliamentary Kashmir Committee Chairman Shehryar Khan Afridi Saturday called upon the prosperous world to intervene into the Illegal Indian occupation of Jammu and Kashmir as 600 days of the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A had gone by but the world had failed to act and stop colonialisation of Jammu and Kashmir by India.\nHe expressed these views while addressing participants of a seminar held here titled ‘Human Security Discourse in 21st Century’ held under the aegis of think tank, The Human Security Institute (THSI).\nHe said that the United Nations must learn from the failure of the League of Nations and play its role in resolving longstanding issues hampering peace and development in the world.\nHe said that if the UN fails to resolve disputes and conflicts, there would be a huge question mark on the fate of the United Nations.\nHe said that prosperous world needs to realise that their trade interests in India could make them compromise on human rights and human values.\nSouth Asian region had been left behind due to lingering regional conflicts and border disputes, he said.\nPakistan and India are nuclear capable countries while the region had two more nuclear states – China and Russia, said the Kashmir Committee chairman.\n“Any dispute or conflict may affect the entire world. Failure to resolve Kashmir dispute is a time bomb ticking for the region, the recent border conflict between China and India is a good example. With Pakistan, China and India as parties of Kashmir dispute, there would always be a possibility of a new conflict as the three countries are nuclear states. Hence, Kashmir is a nuclear flash point,” he said.\nShehryar Khan Afridi said that Kashmiris had been deprived of their freedom, economy, lands and identity and India was committing a massive genocide of Kashmiris in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\n“India is forcefully converting Muslims into Hindus. Mosques are being erased and temples are being erected. Human security is at threat and Kashmiris are being killed in a bid to remove Kashmiris from Kashmir,” he said.\nShehryar Afridi said that Kashmiri nation faced threats of human security, food security, economic security, cultural security and India was implementing war crimes in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir after abrogation of Articles 370 and 35-A making Kashmir a fit case for United Nations intervention.\nHe said that Pakistan fought biggest war against terrorism in land after World War-II but the prosperous world had failed to recognise our contributions for the world peace.\nHe said that India was employing rape as a tool of genocide but the so-called champions of human rights were looking the other way.\n“Nobody talks about Indian war crimes, concentration camps in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir. Half widows and prisoners of conscience are a scar at the face of the prosperous world,” he said.\nShehryar Afridi said that while the world was spending a lot on ecological development and green development, Indian forces were removing forests and houses were being blatantly blown through explosives, depriving the Kashmiris of their houses and their green habitat.",
