  "content": "LAHORE, Mar 27 (APP): Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) Malik Ameen Aslam, MNAs Raja Riaz, Khurram Shahzad and Raza Nasarullah Ghuman, called on Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar here on Saturday.\nThe development projects, issues of respective constituencies and matters of mutual interest came under discussion during the meeting.\nUsman Buzdar assured the MNAs of resolving problems of their constituencies and said that like the provincial assembly members, the MNAs were also his companions. He said that the elected representatives had been consulted in all development projects.\nSolving problems of the constituencies and timely completion of ongoing development schemes was top priority of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, added Usman Buzdar.\nThe chief minister said that a separate development package had been chalked out for each district.\n“I have visited various districts including Faisalabad and Attock,” he added. He said that the PTI government had rectified the faults and shortcomings of the previous rulers. He added that the national resources were waste in the exhibitory projects in the past by ignoring the basic problems of people. The PTI government was focused on solving problems of the common man as it believed in the composite development of all areas, he added.\nHe said that the incumbent government, by introducing reforms in different sectors in a short span of time, had set a new precedent. He said that the PTI believed in deliverance, not in lip-service. He added that the PTI government had taken several steps for welfare of the people in its short tenure. “We came to power with the agenda to public service,” he said.\nThe unnatural alliance of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) had met its logical end, he added.\nThe opposition was now reaping what it had sown in the past, he added.\nHe said that the opposition had left no stone unturned to complete the development projects. They have been exposed among the people, he said. The PDM should refrain from politics of chaos, he warned.",
