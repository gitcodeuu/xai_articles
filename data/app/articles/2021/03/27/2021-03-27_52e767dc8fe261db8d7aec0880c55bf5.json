The department had spread the net of Dar-ul-Aman in all 36 districts of Punjab and theses homes could accommodate 20 to 50 residents at the time.\nSACM said that core purpose of today’s visits was to review the basic facilities which were being provided in the Dar-ul-Aman. She said that theses homes were presented a practical picture of our society, adding “We have to make efforts to bring progress in our society.”\nShe said that Punjab government had devised a new plan of action with the consensus of provincial minister social welfare to bring reforms in the department,a dding that digitalization would also be introduced in the department matters to make classified data of females who live in Dar-ul-Aman.\nDr Firdous said, “Keeping in view the increase in coronavirus cases in Punjab, the government may impose complete lockdown, however, it will be decided in the National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) upcoming meeting.”\nShe said that the smart lockdown imposed by the government was not being taken seriously by the people, after that complete lockdown would be the only solution. She said, “If the people do not follow SOPs then government will have to take more strong measure to curb the spread of coronavirus.”\nShe said “It is our constitutional and legal responsibility to protect the lives of the people.”\nTo a question she said that Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was a story of the past and its narrative was also buried by its leaders.\nShe said that Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) had politically done well during the whole scenario. She said that cancellation of April 4 rally was a wise decision by the PPP due to increasing coronavirus cases.\nTo another query about PDM, she said Maryam and Bilawal were politically immature and they had to learn more. Dr Firdous said that Mayram was a good actor, but not a good politician.",
