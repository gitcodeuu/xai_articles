Only a quality leadership of high moral calibre led a nation to success, he added.\nImran Khan proposed Al-Qadir University to carryout research on the concept of Islam’s first welfare State of Medina that was based on the principles of socioeconomic justice and high moral standards.\nThe prime minister flanked by Minister for Science and Technology Chaudry Fawad Hussain and MNA Farrukh Altaf planted a sapling in the premises of Al-Qadir University, to be developed into an Olive Orchard.\nSo far, the Sufi and Research blocks at the university have been completed, while two other academic blocks, hostel and faculty residences are presently under construction.\nUnder Miyawaki urban forest project, around 16,500 trees will be planted at the university premises including 1,000 olive and another 34,500 saplings to be planted in the vicinity.",
