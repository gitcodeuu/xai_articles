  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 23 (APP):Kashmir Committee Chairman Shehryar khan Afridi on Tuesday felicitated the entire nation on Pakistan Day and vowed to extend his diplomatic, moral and political support to Kashmiri brothers in their inalienable right to self determination.\nKashmir was an unfinished agenda of 1947 partition, he said while expressing his commitment to mobilize all resources for the independence of Kashmir.\nIn his message on the occasion of Pakistan Day, he said the Day reminded us the sacrifices made by our elders in making this country.\nHe paid tribute to the Kashmiri brothers and sisters for showing continued resistance against Indian oppression and barbarism for the last several decades.\nThe ideology of Pakistan was the basis for the establishment of Pakistan, under which the Muslim leadership refused to be dominated by the Hindutva mentality and struggled for the establishment of a separate state, said Afridi.\nThe sacrifices of freedom fighters of occupied Kashmir will not go in vain, he remarked.\nHe said people of Indian-occupied Kashmir were also celebrating Pakistan Day by hoisting Pakistani flags at their homes as Pakistanis’ hearts beat with Kashmiri brothers’.",
