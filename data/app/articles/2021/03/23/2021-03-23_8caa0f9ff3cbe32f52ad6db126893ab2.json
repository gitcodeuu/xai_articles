  "content": "ISLAMABAD, March 23 (APP): Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Tuesday said Pakistan was committed to pursuing policies of co-existence that promote peace and stability, development partnerships, and connectivity.\n“Rather than partaking in geopolitical competition and rivalries, Pakistan is advocating co-existence and win-win cooperation,” the Foreign Minister said in his message on Pakistan Day.\nThe Foreign Minister said, “While fully resolved to protect our vital national security interests, our emphasis is shifting from geo-strategic to geo-economics.”\nHe termed March 23 an important landmark in the history of the nation to commemorate the valiant struggle of forefathers for a separate homeland.\nThe struggle began with the historic Pakistan Resolution of 1940, and culminated in the attainment of freedom seven years later, he added.\nQureshi said Pakistan Resolution truly reflected the deep national and historical aspirations and desires.\n“On this Day, we pay rich tribute to the Father of the Nation and all leaders, elders, martyrs and heroes who rendered great sacrifices for the realization of our dream”\n“On this Day, we pay rich tribute to the Father of the Nation and all leaders, elders, martyrs, and heroes who rendered great sacrifices for the realization of our dream,” he said.\nThe Qureshi said the Day provided the nation an opportunity every year to renew its commitment to making the country true welfare, progressive and prosperous state.\nHe said Pakistani leadership’s vision of ‘Naya Pakistan’ was focused around economic security for the well-being and welfare of people.\nHe also expressed solidarity and support to Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their just struggle for the right to self-determination as enshrined in the relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions.\nHe mentioned that while the COVID-19 pandemic had presented unprecedented challenges to the world, it also offered new opportunities for international solidarity and cooperation.\n“Pakistan continues to underscore the need for greater global collaboration to decisively defeat this menace,” he said.\nHe said nations have to go through difficult times, but only with unity they sail through. We, Pakistanis, have exhibited tremendous responsibility in fighting the pandemic, he added.\nThe Foreign Minister stressed that as the virus continues to threaten lives, the country could not afford to overlook the importance of preventive measures.\nHe prayed to Allah Almighty to keep Pakistan and mankind safe.",
