The powerful nations’ hypocrisy and inhuman attitude with the capacity of distant use of weaponry was a serious challenge, he added.\nDr Alvi said Pakistan always believed in peace and harmony, but “we must maintain our defence edge and that will only be possible by having modern weaponry”. Pakistan could not afford wars as it had to focus on social and economic issues of the people. All that could be achieved through provision of quality and modern education, and health, he added.\n“ The Muslims have a bright history of having edge over the non-Muslims in the wars despite being short in number. And today is the same situation, however, similarity of weaponry is necessary,” he said.\nThe president said there were many Hadiths (sayings) of the Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him) stressing on high moral values and human compassion for a better society. The Prophet (PBUH) had also emphasized on acquiring knowledge and education from any part of the world.\nHe said for the respectful living, survival and progressing in today’s world, the Pakistani nation needed high patriotism, with strong and sustained economy. In next ten years, he added, Pakistan would be a strong and fast progressing Muslim state on the world map.\nPresident Alvi condemned the aggressive attitude of India towards its neighbours. It had unleashed a reign of terror and cruelties on the Muslims in IIOJK for long. It always befooled the world while building its defence power, he added.\nHe appreciated the efforts of PAF leadership for professional grooming of the air force. It was a matter of pleasure that AWC Institute had become a defence degree awarding institute, he said, expressing the confidence that it would emerge as a leading international defence institute .\nEarlier on his arrival, President Alvi was received by Deputy Chief of Staff (Training) Vice Air Marshal Aamir Masood , AWC Institute President Vice Air Marshal Zulfiqar Ahmed Qureshi and other senior officers of Pakistan Air Force.\nVice Air Marshal Aamir Masood presented a memento to President Alvi, while Vice Air Marshal Zulfiqar Ahmed Qureshi briefed him on the institute’s history, its role in defence training, and future plans.",
