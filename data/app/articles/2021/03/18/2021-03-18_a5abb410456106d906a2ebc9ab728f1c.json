He said there were countless shrines, stupas and seminaries and no less than 270 Sikh Gurdwaras in Pakistan and the government of Pakistan was taking many initiatives to restore many of those historical places.\nHe urged the Canadians and the tourists elsewhere in the world to look to Pakistan as their next tourist destination.\nHe said the security situation had improved manifold in Pakistan and even the United Nations which was extremely touchy about security and many of its missions had been called off because of security advisories in the past, no longer treated Islamabad as a non-family station.\nHe said countries like the UK, the US and Canada had also positively revised their advisories about Pakistan. He also referred to the positive experiences of the members of Sikh community who had visited Pakistan in recent times.\nThe High Commissioner welcomed suggestions and recommendations of the panelists, particularly the idea of promoting medical tourism in Pakistan, turning many Hindu and Budhist archaeological and heritage sites into living monuments and living breathing places where people could come and pay homage on a regular basis, and the marking of specific events such as the birthday of Lord Buddha.\nThe panelists also called for production of professional documentaries along with subtitles in various languages, including Korean, Japanese and Thai languages, to take Pakistan’s religious tourism to a wider global audience.",
