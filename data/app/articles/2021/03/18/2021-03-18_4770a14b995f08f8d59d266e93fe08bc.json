This, in short, is the prime significance of Pakistan Day, which commemorates that landmark resolution.\nThe resolution was moved in the second open session on the afternoon of March 23.\nThe first session on March 22 had been taken up by, among others matters, Jinnah’s extempore two-hour presidential address in which he argued for the most part the Muslim case for separate nationhood in sociological and political terms and called for “their homelands, their territories and their state” so that they could “develop to the fullest our spiritual, cultural, economic, social and political life in a way we think best, and in consonance with our own ideals and according to the genius of our people”.\nMoved by Premier Fazlul Haq of Bengal and seconded by Choudhry Khaliquzzaman (UP), this lengthy resolution comprising some 450 words was supported by Maulana Zafar Ali Khan (Punjab), Sardar Aurangzeb Khan (NWFP), and Sir Abdullah Haroon (Sindh) before the session was adjourned till the next day.\nOn March 24, when discussion on the resolution was resumed, it was supported by Mohammad Ismail Khan (Bihar), Qazi Mohammad Isa Khan (Balochistan), Abdul Hamid Khan (Madras), Ismail Chundrigar (Bombay), Syed Abdur Rauf Shah (CP), and Dr. Mohammad Alam (Punjab).\nProf Fateh Mailk said Pakistan came into existence seven years after the resolution of March 23, 1940 is a wonder in itself. It was created in the wake of sharp ideological divides that were exacerbated by the prejudiced conduct of the Hindu leadership, whose sole aim was to subdue the Muslim population after India’s independence from British colonial rule.\nInspired by the sagacity and farsightedness of philosopher Allama Muhammad Iqbal and founder of the nation Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Muslims of the subcontinent soon realized that they risked becoming a permanent minority if India remained undivided after Independence.\nThis realization was not based on apprehension alone but on solid calculations. In the emerging, post-independence scenario, it was likely to become nearly impossible for Muslims to protect their fundamental rights under the umbrella of the Hindu majority, whose leaders and elite had already started exhibiting hegemonic attitudes.\nJinnah’s address to the Lahore Conference motivated multitudes of Muslims to launch a sustainable, unwavering movement for freedom.\nWith unflinching resolve and great sacrifices rendered by Muslims of the sub-continent under the dynamic leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan came into being on August 14, 1947 and appeared on the world map as a sovereign state.\nSince then, Pakistan defended its independence and faced all problems and challenges bravely, failing all the sinister designs of enemies on every front; besides laying a solid foundation for sustained progress towards its cherished goal.\nEvery year, the nation celebrates March 23 as Pakistan Day with a renewed pledge to make the country the strongest by all means, especially on economic and defence fronts so that no one could even think of casting an evil eye on the motherland.\nSpeaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser said March 23 had a great significance in the national history and he believed it was the day when “we celebrate our independence in a befitting manner.”\nThe present government, he said, was taking far-reaching steps to transform the country into a state in line with the vision of the Quaid-e-Azam .\nMinister for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan highlighted background and objectives of the Pakistan Day, raising a number of poignant questions about reasoning behind creation and meaning of Pakistan, its justice, social and economic systems.\nNow, it is the time of doing something practical, not raising mere emotional slogans. That is why this nation has chosen Imran Khan as its prime minister for practical work,” he said.\nThe minister underlined the need for promoting the culture of self-accountability in the society.",
