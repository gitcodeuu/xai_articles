  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 19 (APP):The Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan has warned that brazen demographic change in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK) was creating tensions that could push the region to a disastrous war.\nHe was addressing a virtual conference on “BJP’s Demographic Re-branding of IIOJK: A critical Review Under Contemporary International Law” which was organized by the Islamabad Institute of Conflict Resolution (IICR) here on Friday.\nThe conference was also addressed by Security Analyst, Lt General (Retd) Amjad Shoaib, Professor Dr Mushtaq Ahmed, Professor Department of Law, International Islamic University, Islamabad, Nasir Qadri, Human Rights Lawyer in IIOJK and Sabah Aslam, Executive Director IICR.\nThe AJK president said that since the New Domicile Rules were adopted in April last year, more than 3.2 million Indian citizens have been issued domicile certificates in the disputed Jammu and Kashmir state, and this has been confirmed by Indian Minister for Home Affairs G. Kishan Reddy the other day.\n“These demographic changes prepare the ground for settlements on the pattern of the Israeli settlements on Palestine land,” he said adding that massive investment is being diverted to entrepreneurs to make them a part of this settlement process.\nHe said special colonies have been established in IIOJK for army personnel, pundits and former Indian civil servants.\nThe state president said two Human Rights experts of the UN Human Rights Council have also expressed grave concern over the demographic changes being made by the BJP-RSS regime in occupied Kashmir.\nHe recalled that Fernand de Verennes and Ahmed Shaheed of UNHRC have said in a joint statement that “The number of successful applicants for domicile certificates that appear to be from outside Jammu and Kashmir raises concerns that demographic change on a linguistic, religious and ethnic basis is already underway,” and adding “these legislative changes may have the potential to pave the way for people from outside the former state of Jammu and Kashmir to settle in the region, alter the demographics of the region and undermine the minorities’ ability to exercise effectively their human rights.”\nAgreeing with the observations of the UNHRC experts, the AJK president said that Kashmiris are not a minority in the Indian state as this region is disputed and is not a part of India.\nThese crimes by India violate Article 2 of Genocide Convention and Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention which prohibits occupying forces to “transfer parts of its own civilian population into the territory it occupies”.\nThese also violate 85(4) (a) Additional Protocol I, ICC Statutes Article 8(2) (b) (viii) and 22 (3) (b) of the International Law Commission’s Draft code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind.\nAbove all, he asserted that the Indian actions in Kashmir violate the UN Security Council resolutions No 446, 452, 465, 476 and 677. He went on to say that the UN Security Council, International Court of Justice, International Criminal Council, International Law Commission and HRC are the proper and relevant forums to raise these issues.\nSardar Masood Khan stressed to engage legal experts and academic institutions to compile the human rights violations being committed by the Indian forces in IIOJK.\nHe said that communication should be made with the world leaders, and parliaments all over the world should also be engaged. Besides, civil society organizations, human rights organizations and media outlets can be engaged to compile these human rights violations in IIOJK.",
