He added that the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), which put the national interests aside, had met its logical end.\nThe chief minister said that those who created hurdles in the national development had failed in the past and they would meet the same fate in future as well.\nThe PTI government believes in serving people, he said and added that the government would complete its tenure.\nThe elements hatching conspiracies would get nothing as the government would respond to the opposition’s negative politics through public service, he added.",
