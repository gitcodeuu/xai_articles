He said: “Together we will not allow any one to defame our country’s image.”\n“In the name of Islam, some vested interest politicians have defamed the country and the nation but now the scholars have woken up and no one would be able to use the scholars for their own benefit,” Dr. Noor-ul-Haq Qadri added.\nThe conference was presided over by Hazrat Pir Shamsul Amin Sajjada Nasheen Astana Alia Qadri Manki Sharif.
