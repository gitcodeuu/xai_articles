People are being put on ventilators or oxygen. We are the nation which was exemplified during the first wave (for our discipline). God forbids, our hospitals will fill to their capacity if it continues to spread with the current rate,” the prime minister said in his televised message to the nation.\nThe prime minister, who is in quarantine for testing positive for COVID-19 a week ago, told the people that he remained safe during the first two waves as he had duly observed the precautions.\nDuring the first two waves, he neither attended any wedding ceremonies nor visited any restaurant and also kept wearing the mask.\nکورونا وبا کے حوالے سے وزیر اعظم عمران خان کا قوم کے لئے اہم پیغام.@ImranKhanPTI https://t.co/PTEWrRz2UC\n— Government of Pakistan (@GovtofPakistan) March 28, 2021\nHowever, during the Senate polls, he could not adhere to the SOPs which led to his infection, he added.\nThe prime minister told the people that the world was witness to the fact that wearing mask greatly reduced the chances of COVID infection.\nHe said owing to shortage of resources to feed the people during lockdown, the government could not close down the business and industries, which was not even affordable for many resourceful countries too.\n“But at least, we can observe SOPs,” the prime minister said.\nHe said the third strain came from England and the carriers came to Lahore, Peshawar and Islamabad where the virus was spreading fast.\nHe said owing to the intensity of the third wave, the availability of COVID-19 vaccine has reduced. We are not getting supply even from the countries which had committed, because of shortage in the manufacturing countries.\nTherefore, it was better to follow the SOPs and avoid visiting the super spreader venues like wedding ceremonies, restaurants or any closed door gatherings.\n“We cannot close business and factories but what we can do is to avoid visiting close public places,” he added.\nThe prime minister said that Allah had blessed him as well as wife (during the disease) but it could prove to be a lethal disease if it infected the patient’s chest.\nEarlier, Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Services Dr Faisal Sultan said on Twitter that the prime minister had been advised that he may resume work and build up his work routine over the next few days.\n“PM Imran Khan has made steady clinical recovery from Covid and his lab parameters have remained stable,” he said",
