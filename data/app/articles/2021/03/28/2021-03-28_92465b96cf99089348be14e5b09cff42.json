General (Retd) Anwar Ali Hyder, State Bank Governor Raza Baqir, President of National Bank of Pakistan Arif Usmani and Executive Director SBP Samar Hasnain.\nThe prime minister joined the telethon telephonically for being in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19 a week ago.\nImran Khan said that the NBP, being the premier bank of the country, should also instruct its staffers, to facilitate the loan applicants, observing that the bank employees were also not in habit of extending such easy loans to the cashless people.\nLIVE : Telethon transmission regarding Naya Pakistan Housing Scheme#APPNews #PrimeMinisterImrankhan https://t.co/JOExfgNOnj\n— APP  (@appcsocialmedia) March 28, 2021\nHe said there was no such concept of housing loan for the poor people in the country, that was why the people were facing difficulties in the beginning.\nThe prime minister said that once the people started building their own house, the construction industry would boom to help boost allied 30 other industries. Consequently, the wealth would create and increase revenue for the country besides creating jobs for the people, he added.\nHe said this was the first time in Pakistan that the salaried class or the people with no cash were getting opportunity to own a house.\nImran Khan said the program had been designed in such a way that the beneficiaries currently giving money to pay house rent would be using the same to pay housing loan installment.\nAs per details, the beneficiaries of the housing loans would have to pay monthly installment of Rs 6,600 for 1 million loan, Rs 13,199 for two million, Rs 19,799 for three million, Rs 26,398 for four million, and Rs 32,998 for five million loan.\nThe prime minister said the people across the world like Europe or USA bought their houses through bank loans but it had not been a practice in Pakistan.\nHe said under the program, not only the people would own a house rather the national economy would also get a boost.\nHe said as the country was under debt burden, the wealth creation was direly needed to increase the revenue.\n“In all ways, this is an important project for the country,” the prime minister remarked.\nTo a question, the prime minister said the government would give preference to the widows and differently-abled person to give them houses under the program for they being the government’s responsibility.\nThe people aspiring to own a house under the prime minister’s pro-poor housing program, joined the transmission by calling at 0519215595 and the panelists responded to their complaints.\nGovernor SBP Raza Baqir said the banks had eased out the loaning conditions. In order to facilitate the applicants, the SBP had standardized the list of documents required for housing loans.\nThe applicants would require to provide copy of CNIC, two passport sized photo, salary slip in case of job or copy of rent agreement of shop or house to make the banks assess the income and fix an installment.\nMoreover, the SBP had also established 16 offices to register complaints and guide the applicants of the housing loan.\nAnwar Ali Hyder said the government has announced to extend Rs 300,000 subsidy for the construction of each first 100,000 houses to be constructed under the Naya Pakistan Housing Program.\nPresident NBP Arif Usmani said the people could directly approach him through contact No. 03025567776 in case of any glitch in their loan process.\nSenator Shibli Faraz said this was the beginning of fulfillment of a dream to develop Pakistan as welfare state. The government has taken multiple steps which were never taken in the country.\nThe previous notions of Roti, Kapra and Makan remained confined to words but this government took practical measures to realize it, he added.",
