Shahbaz Sharif who was the guarantor for Nawaz Sharif, could not fulfill the commitment, he said adding that Ex Prime Minister was deliberately avoiding to return Pakistan to skip from corruption cases.\nIt was an indecent act being committed by leader of Pakistan Muslim League-N, to take mob to NAB office, he said. Maryam Nawaz was challenging writ of the government, he added. No one was allowed to violate law and order in the country, he warned.\nThe Opposition, he said should sit with the government for reforms and desist from creating chaos at public places. Replying to a question about sexual abuse case of a minor reported in Kohat, he suggested that perpetrators of crime should be hanged publicly.\nTo another question, he said Opposition should play role and cooperate with the ruling party for legislation so that strict laws could be implemented to avoid recurrence of such incidents in future.",
