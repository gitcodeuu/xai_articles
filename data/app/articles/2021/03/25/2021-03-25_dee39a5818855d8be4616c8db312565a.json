Yet, every year the country keeps on climbing up the ladder of climate vulnerability. ”\nAccording to the long-term German Watch index, Pakistan has remained constantly among top 10 climate vulnerable countries each year since 2010.\n“It is imperative for the developing world, which are more vulnerable to climate change, to plan their development with climate change in mind. This is what the National Adaptation Plan process seeks to achieve in Pakistan,” he stressed.\nLaunched formally on March 25 at a virtual event,  the two-year USD 2.7 million project would be funded and technically supported jointly by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) and the Green Climate Fund, said Dr Mazhar Hussain, climate change ministry deputy secretary and National Adaptation Plan coordinator.\nThe ministry official said further that the event was organised successfully, which was attended by dozens of high-level representatives of government ministries, academia, the private sector and key members of Pakistani government.\nThe climate change ministry official Dr Mazhar Hussain highlighted that Pakistan would be tapping into the National Adaptation Plan process at a full pace and its outcomes to boost the adaptation elements of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), a central aspect of the 2015 Paris Agreement and national roadmap to cut climate altering carbon emissions.\nMeanwhile, Malik Amin Aslam said that Pakistan has well-thought plans to submit its revised Nationally Determined Contributions before the upcoming UN climate change conference to be held this year in Glasgow.\n“The National Adaptation Plan process is accordingly being aligned with the NDCs to ensure coherent implementation,” he told the online participants.\nSince international climate negotiations began in 1990, global greenhouse gas emissions, that have paced up global warming have spiked by 62 per cent over last 30 years,” Jessica Troni, Head of the Climate Change Adaptation Unit at the UN Environment Programme, recalled.\n“This shows us why adaptation must be seen as a core approach for tackling the climate crisis,” she said.\nLauding Pakistan’s efforts for preparing the national adaptation plan, the UNEP official hoped the plan would heighten the country’s capacity to promote adaptation at all levels of governance.\nThe process initiated today for making national adaption plan of Pakistan would lead to the establishing of a system for generating and sharing adaptation, knowledge, experiences, and lessons learned, she hoped.",
