  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 25 (APP): Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) Senator Shibli Faraz Thursday said Maryam Nawaz should know that the law in Naya Pakistan could no longer be subservient to her.\nIt was reprehensible that they launched an assault against the institutions using their party workers as a shield instead answering the questions (about their wrongdoings) asked by them, he said in a statement.\nThe attackers of Supreme Court showed cowardice by using their workers as a shield whenever they were questioned by the law, he added.\nShibli Faraz said the real face of those, who adopted violent tactics to escape from the grip of law had been exposed again.\nThe rise and fall of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) was linked to the cases filed by the National Accountability Bureau against its leaders and their appearances, remarked Shibli Faraz.\nHe said the PDM got disintegrated when its leaders got bails, and receipt of notices from the national institutions had reunited them.\nShibli Faraz said Maryam Nawaz was could not see beyond her own interests and those of Sharif family, and regretfully using the people and party workers to save the same.",
