PDM did not succeed in its political moves as PTI remained successful party in Senate election.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan also succeeded to get vote of confidence. PMD tried all tactics to create unrest and shake the confidence of the investors and damage national economy. They failed on all fronts, Ghulam Sarwar said.\nHe said, opposition parties should not create law and order situation and not to indulge in politics on the name of Islam.",
