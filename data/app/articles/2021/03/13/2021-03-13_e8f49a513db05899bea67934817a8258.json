Other federal ministers as well as members of the academia and media will also participate.\nAt the event, the Prime Minister will also launch the first of its kind Advisory Portal of the National Security Division. The portal is the brian child of Dr. Moeed Yusuf, SAPM on NSD and is designed to bridge the traditional gap between public intellectuals and policy makers.\nMany countries in the world have used strong think tank – government collaboration to effectively project their policies and build a positive image globally for their countries.\nThe NSD portal will allow national think tanks and universities working on national security to directly offer policy recommendations to the government and can be path breaking in this regard.",
