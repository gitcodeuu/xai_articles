Unfortunately, the opposition had rejected a bill tabled by a PTI member in the Parliament, which was aimed at ensuring timely payment of salaries to the media persons.\nHowever, the government was working on another bill for the security of working journalists, he added.\nHe said the PTI government was in favour of a mechanism under which the media workers should get their salaries in time. The government had paid outstanding dues of the media houses, he added.\nShibli Faraz said the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists had a commendable history and had produced leaders like Minhaj Barna, who made untiring struggle for the rights of journalists. Such leaders were a beacon of light for the generations ahead, he added.\nHe appreciated the media persons for performing their duties during the ongoing corona pandemic bravely and effectively.",
