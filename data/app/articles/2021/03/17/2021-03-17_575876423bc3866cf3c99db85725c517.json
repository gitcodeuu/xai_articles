  "content": "PESHAWAR, Mar 17 (APP): Special Assistant to the Chief Minister Khyber Pakhtunkhwa on Information and Higher Education, Kamran Bangash on Wednesday said those who pretended to topple an elected government have themselves entered into a blind alley and were hiding their faces from the public.\nIn a brief chat with the media here, Kamran Bangash further said the PTI government would complete its tenure and form the next government on the basis of its people-friendly policies and performance.\nReferring to PDM’s decision to delay its long march, the CM’S Aide said those propagating against the government were now looking for a place to hide their faces from masses. He said the long-march of PDM has ended before it could get a start.\nThe PDM alliance, he said, was unnatural and it has to face disintegration, adding, all their tall claims have turned into a wall of sand. People have also rejected the PDM as it was talking against the government institution which was totally unacceptable.\nKamran Bangash added that PDM leaders used to deliver hours-long speeches but at the end they failed to answer even a single question from the media.",
