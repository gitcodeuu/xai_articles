The fine increases with repeated violations, he added.\n“So far we have imposed fines to the tune of thousands of rupees on customers, shopkeepers, wholesalers and manufacturers since March 1 and confiscated thousands of polythene bags during various raids in different parts of the capital city and around areas,” said the senior joint secretary.\nAdditional Deputy Commissioner Islamabad (East) Babar Sahib Din said that ICT administration is committed to the climate change ministry’s efforts for making Islamabad free from polythene bags and continue provide all-out support to achieve the goal for larger benefits of environmental protection and public health.\nLead expert on plastic pollution and chemicals at the climate change ministry, Deputy Director Dr Zaigham Abbas, who is also part of the ban enforcement efforts, felt sorry saying that though shopkeepers and people in markets showed being adequately aware of the devastating impacts of polythene bags on environment and public health, they expressed different excuses and demonstrated carelessness behind their using of the polythene bags.\n“Nevertheless, they are being warned during the raids conducted in different areas of the city of the more stringent actions and fines against them if caught in possession of the polythene bags,” the climate change ministry official said.\nExplaining devastating impacts of the polythene bags on environment and public health, Dr Abbas said that the polythene bags are non-biodegradable and take around hundreds of years to decompose.\nThey lead to a lot of waste that keeps amassing over the years and remain in the land and water bodies, which contributes to soil and water pollution, Dr Abbas added.",
