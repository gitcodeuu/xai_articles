Counter-terrorism has become a consensus of the international community and significant progress has been made in the global fight against terrorism.\nDouble standards must be abandoned on the issue of counter-terrorism, and no one should politicize or instrumentalise counter-terrorism, or interfere in other countries’ internal affairs and infringe on their sovereignty under the pretext of counter-terrorism, added Jiang.\nSpeaking by video link, Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the Pakistan Senate Defence Committee, said that the issue of human rights has been politicized and used as a political weapon by certain countries to exert pressure on others that do not serve their interests.\nThe attacks on China by some Western countries using issues related to China’s Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Tibet are also politically motivated, which reflect the double standards pursued by Western countries, he said.\nLiang Yuchun, an expert at Xinjiang Normal University, said that China’s counter-terrorism approach was not only consistent with the common practice of the international community, but also features Chinese characteristics.\n“This has effectively curbed the frequent occurrence of terrorist incidents and protected to the greatest extent the basic rights of people of all ethnic groups, including their right to subsistence and development,” said Liang.\nTo date, no terrorist incident had been recorded in Xinjiang for more than four consecutive years, the expert pointed out.\nAlfred De Zayas, former senior human rights expert at the United Nations, said via video link, “While the United Nations recognizes that terrorism is a scourge of our times that must be combated, we also know that we cannot defeat terrorism merely by brute force. It is necessary to look for the root causes and to try to correct the injustices and imbalances that lead some people to commit terrorist actions.”\nThe expert also pointed out that one of the feasible means of combating terrorism is to achieve sustainable development goals, including the eradication of poverty worldwide.\nThe seminar was co-sponsored by the China Society for Human Rights Studies and the information office of the Guangdong provincial government, and hosted by Jinan University.",
