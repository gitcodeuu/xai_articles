Prime Minister, Imran Khan is very much concerned about impact of inflation on poor people and discusses the way forward to address this issue in every meeting.\nExplaining the procedure, Dr. Sania said that the eligible families, to be identified through a transparent system, will be able to avail the facility of buying essential commodities like flour, Sugar, Ghee etc. on subsidized rates.\nThe families will be able to know their eligibility status through the Ehsaas portal for availing this facility and visit the designated stores where the shopkeeper with the help of an installed app will check their information and then pass on the subsidy, she added.\nAbout expansion of the Ehsaas One Window initiative nationwide, the SAPM said that the Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa governments have agreed to provide space for establishing One Window Centers to facilitate the Ehsaas beneficiaries.\nThe One Window Center in federal capital is facilitating thousands of disadvantaged people from far flung areas through providing them all the services related to NADRA, designated banks, Langar, Panahgah etc and guidance about all the 19 Ehsaas projects.\nResponding to a question about progress on the Ehsaas National Socio-Economic Registry (NSER), Dr. Sania said that the survey is the backbone of all the Ehsaas projects as benefits are extended to the deserving people after checking their socio-economic data with the help of this survey.\nThe survey was lingering since the last decade. “We have completed this survey up to 99.7 percent after hard work of three years, even crossing the target of the households given by the Bureau of Statistics”, she said.\nSharing about the global socio-economic impacts of COVID-19, Dr. Sania said many of the world organizations changed their targets after emergence of the pandemic but we continued our efforts to implement the social protection interventions throughout the period by launching many of the new initiatives.\nHighlighting the COVID-19 specific initiatives, she said over 15 million families received the cash assistance under the Ehsaas Emergency Cash Program Phase-I which was aimed at addressing the economic hardships of the people during the pandemic.\n“We ensured that along with the massive cash disbursements during the pandemic; we do not miss our other targets”, she said.\n“The decisions were taken to expand certain programs nationwide at that time considering the increasing economic difficulties of the people”, she said.\nIn the Ehsaas Emergency Cash Program Phase-II, around four million people are being provided cash assistance. Around 70 percent cash disbursement process has been completed so far while rests of the payments are continued, she said.\nDr. Sania highlighted that NSER has been made shock responsive as cash assistance is being provided to those affected by earthquake, drought, floods or any devastation with the help of this survey data. “The cash assistance is being provided to the quake affected people in Harnai, Balochistan with the help of NSER”.\nDr. Sania pointed out that another impactful program of Ehsaas will be Ehsaas Tahafuz initiative which we have been piloting for the last two and a half year through creating its systems.\nThe people not availing any health insurance will just text the government to seek health aid to meet their catastrophic health expenditures and they will be assisted. “This will be our most effective program in the next six months”, she hoped.\nAbout the expansion of Panahgah initative, the SAPM said that Capital Development Authority (CDA) has provided four plots to set up purpose-built Panahgahs in the capital which will be linked with the One Window Centers.\nDr. Sania said that Ehsaas has also signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Serena Hotel under which the staff of Hotel will provide hospitality training to the Panahgahs staff.\nThousands of people are eating two time meals at the Ehsaas Langars and now Langar on Wheels program has also started to provide meals to the people, she added.\nOn the education side, Dr. Sania mentioned that three programs including Ehsaas School Stipends, Ehsaas Undergraduate Scholarships and other selected Postgraduate scholarships were being implemented successfully and yielding positive results.",
