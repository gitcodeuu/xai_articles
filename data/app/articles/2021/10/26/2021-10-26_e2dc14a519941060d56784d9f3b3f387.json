Closeness of our relationship is evident from the fact that for the last three years, since Imran Khan became prime minister, he visited Saudi Arabia seven times.”\nHe said Pakistan keenly wanted to turn the bilateral ties with Saudi Arabia into strategic partnership based on mutual interest and cooperation in diverse areas.\nThere were similarities between the social and economic objectives of Naya Pakistan of prime minister Imran Khan and Vision 2030 of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salam, he observed.\nHe said both the leaders had stressed on economic opportunities, economic growth, modernity, progress, trade and regional connectivity.\nQureshi said Pakistan believed in a shift from geopolitics to geoeconomics which emphasized on economic partnership rather than political competition.\n“We want internal and external peace so that we can focus on the agenda of social and economic progress. We desire partnership for progress and want to focus on trade, economic contacts and connections so that regional prosperity can be achieved.”\nHe said Pakistan provided the shortest route for access to Central Asia from the landlock Afghanistan and access of sea from Karachi and Gwadar to the western parts of China.\nHe said our effort was to present Pakistan as a hub of economic activities and for advancing positive international interests.China Pakistan Economic Corridor would connect the region through road and rail network, fiber optic cable, energy pipelines and other infrastructure, the minister said adding in the second part of CPEC, focus will be on the sectors of industry, agriculture and social and economic progress.\nThe government was giving special incentives in the special economic zones and the investors could take away 100 percent of their profits and there would be tax and customs exemptions, he concluded.",
