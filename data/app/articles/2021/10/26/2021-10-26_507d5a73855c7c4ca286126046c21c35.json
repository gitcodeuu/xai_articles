  "content": "“October 27, 1947 is the worst and darkest day in the history of Kashmir,” Naqash said in a statement received here from Srinagar, adding that landing of troops and following occupation was made possible with the betrayal of Indian allies in Kashmir, whom people of Kashmir will never forget.\nHe said, ever since India laid its filthy feet on Kashmir, atrocities on innocent Kashmiris continued with sole purpose to prolong occupation.\nCiting the killing of innocent people in extrajudicial and fake encounters, he said that a few days ago, an innocent labourer was killed in Zainapura area of Shopian district while an innocent youth Mustafa, who had been lodged in Kot Bhalwal Jail Jammu since 2003, was martyred in a fake encounter in Poonch district after his fictitious release.\nNaqash said that India had practically turned Kashmir into a slaughterhouse, adding that indiscriminate arrests, spreading fear and silencing the people has become routine matter.\nHe said, Indian Home Minister during his visit to occupied Kashmir tried to give the impression to the world community that Kashmiris were tired and had given up the struggle against India. However, the celebrations over the victory of Pakistani cricket team by Kashmiris frustrated his designs.\nThe slogans like ”Jeewy Jeewy Pakistan” in contrary, demonstrated the hatred of Kashmiris towards India, he added.\nNaqash said that Kashmiris were in high spirits and they would fail nefarious intentions of India besides flopping conspiracies of its allies in Kashmir.",
