  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (APP):Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad Tuesday, expressing the hope, said the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) leadership would call off its sit-in protest as the government had accepted its major demands.\nAddressing a presser, he said the report on the dialogue with the TLP leadership had been submitted to the prime minister which was also discussed in a meeting held today in the presence of civil and military leadership besides chief secretaries and inspector generals of Police.\nThe meeting had shown willingness to accept all the demands of TLP, he said adding, “They have promised to open all roads today so now we are waiting for this as we have no reservations on any of their demand except related with the French embassy.”\nHe said it was their commitment to open roads by Tuesday midnight. “I will make contact with them once again today and tomorrow also. I want a permanent solution to this issue and I want to wind up this matter rather to further linger on.”He hoped that the TLP leadership would understand the situation as enemies were hatching conspiracies against Pakistan to impose sanctions while many Pakistanis were working abroad.\nHe said it was their sixth sit-in as, on November 8, 2017, they held their first sit-in while second in August 2018, third in November 2018, fourth was about the boycott of French products while fifth one was arranged in April 2021.\nHe made it clear that the government was making sincere efforts to get positive results from these talks. “We want peace in the country. It is our endeavour to settle all the matters with TLP as early as possible through dialogue.”\nHe said majority of their workers had been released while the government was ready to discuss the issue of the remaining workers who were in jails besides the matter of the fourth schedule. “We want them to review their only one demand related with the French embassy.”\nHe said despite the martyrdom of two policemen and 70 other injured including two in critical condition, the government still wanted to resolve this issue with mutual understanding and cooperation.\nReplying to a question, he said the cabinet had no issue with any of their demand except related to the French embassy keeping in view the international scenario.He said the present government was working on several options to control inflation on the directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nHe said the prime minister was seriously considering this issue as he wanted to address this as early as possible in a bid to give a sigh of relief to the people.\nHe said the inflation was interlinked with increasing oil prices in the international markets and added several countries of the world were facing the same issue.He said the military leadership and elected political leadership were on the same page as after today’s notification there was no further room for any speculation.",
