It also tried to start a national dialogue for peace.\nMotaharAlashabi said their main concern was to stop the violence and killing as majority of Yemenis were tired of the war.\nThe Yemeni ambassador said the rebels were not sparing even mosques, homes and businesses of ordinary people in this war.\nHe said there were also incidents of enforced disappearances and other crimes against civilians committed by the rebels.\nAppreciating the role of Saudi Arabia, the ambassador said Riyadh had been providing food and other essential supplies to Yemeni people but the most of it did not reach to them due to blockage by rebels.\nHe said Saudi Arabian government was also taking steps to bring down the conflict, but the militant group in Yemen was not sincere in stopping it.\nAs regards to rapprochement between Saudi Arabia and Iran lately, especially the meeting held in Baghdad in recent weeks, he said the Yemeni government hoped that few positive result would come out of these negotiations.\nHe said Yemeni government believed that the United Nations and international community would play their role in bringing peace in Yemen and the region. “The only solution is the complete stoppage of war and holding of pea\nce talks.
