The prime minister would inaugurate the Seerat-un-Nabi conference on 3 Rabi ul Awal which is likely to be on Sunday.\nPM Imran would address the conference, he said, adding the district organizations across Pakistan would arrange celebration ceremonies where the prime minister’s address would be displayed on screens.\nThe minister said the celebrations would help us express our bond with the beloved Prophet Muhammad (SAW).\nAbout the reorganization of PTI, he said the prime minister during the meeting soughta detailed report in that regard.\nHe said the meeting was informed that an elaborate strategy has been evolved to reorganize the party for meeting the looming challenges of the upcoming local government elections.\nMost of the recommendations of the ordinance’s critics have been incorporated, he said while pointing to chronic habit of the opposition to defy every reformative and progressive move of the government either it is electoral reforms or others.\nWhether it was to authorize the trial court to bale the accused or excluded tax evasion cases from the NAB’s purview or strengthening the NAB courts and their judicial system, there were complete consensus on those amendments between the government and opposition, he explained.\nHe said if anyone from the opposition had any issue with the ordinance or recommendations, he should come forward which would be welcomed.\nLashing out at the opposition leaders who ganged up to criticize the newly promulgated NAB ordinance, Fawad termed them ‘a bunch of weeping children’. Their foremost priority was to shed tears only in public, he added.\nHe said the entire PTI had endorsed the new NAB Ordinance which was aimed at strengthening the anti-graft watchdog.\nResponding to a question, he thanked general public of New Zealand and Australia, former international cricketers and cricketing fraternity for supporting Pakistan’s stance on the cancellation of recent tour of New Zealand to Pakistan.",
