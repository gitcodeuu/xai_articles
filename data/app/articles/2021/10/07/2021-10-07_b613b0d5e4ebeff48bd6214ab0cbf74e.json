However, the World Bank (WB) in its Report yesterday came up with really good numbers in a comparison done of countries who are shifting their mainstream development towards environment friendly policies and Pakistan came atop among them,” the SAPM underlined.\nTo a question on Pakistan’s economic sustainability to bear investments in nature based solutions, he said, “We cannot affort not to do it….that’s a cliche in our country and we are living that cliche in Pakistan. We are not just talking the climate talk rather doing climate action in Pakistan.”\nThe SAPM emphasized that the country instead of only raising voice over environmental degradation rather had spent its limited resources to cope with whooping impacts of environmental degradation.\nTo a another query pertaining to the 26th Conference of Parties (COP-26) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Amin said the country’s revised national determined contributions (NDCs) are going to be released next week. “….that’s going to clearly tell the world that this (money) we had spent in nature and could do further and that was also our direction,” he added.\nThe SAPM informed that Pakistan was going to COP 26 with a very clear message that the country has been affected by climate change, climate injustice, adding, “but we are one of the countries that are leading the way to nature based solutions.”\nHe again mentioned the WB Report and said 44% of the country’s mainstream development was climate friendly investment and it had been doubled in the past one year.\nResponding her query, he said the 60% renewable energy mix would to be based on green energy comprising of solar, wind and hydro power projects, where 40% would come from oil and nuclear where nuclear was a zero emission energy solution.\n“Nuclear power has to be part of the country’s energy mix for future as a zero energy emission source for clean and green future,” he concluded.",
