Now due to our endeavors, the Islamabad residents have got a 50% quota in the government jobs, he added.\nHe said as many as 100 new tube wells were being installed to minimize the acute water shortage in the city.\nMoreover, with the cooperation of the Punjab government, we also managed the supply of two million gallons of water daily for Islamabad from Rawal Dam, he added.\nHe informed that the water project for supply of 100 million gallons per day would also be materialized within six months.\nThe minister added that the single national curriculum was the hallmark of the PTI government.\nFurther, he said four new colleges were also under construction in the federal capital.",
