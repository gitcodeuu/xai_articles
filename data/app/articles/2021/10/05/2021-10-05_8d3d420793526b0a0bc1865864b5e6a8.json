Recalling his campaign for debt relief, he advocated for debt relief until the end of the pandemic.\nThe prime minister reaffirmed the urgent need for mobilization of and contribution by richer countries to climate finance in view of the vulnerability and existential challenges faced by Small Island Developing Countries (SIDS) and other developing countries, including Pakistan.\nReiterating his deep concern over the huge challenge of illicit flow of money amounting to $1 trillion annually from developing countries to richer capitals and tax havens, the prime minister underscored the imperative of halting these outflows.\nHe once again emphasised implementation of UN Secretary General’s FACTI Panel’s recommendations, enabling the developing countries to more meaningfully alleviate poverty and human development.\nThe prime minister was invited to the Leaders Dialogue along with presidents of Kenya, and Guyana, Secretary General UNCTAD and heads of other UN agencies, under the theme of “Building a more prosperous development path: Matching the scale of the moment”.\nBeing held from October 4-7, 2021, the Quadrennial Conference is taking place in the backdrop of unprecedented economic, public health and social effects, induced and exacerbated by COVID-19 pandemic.",
