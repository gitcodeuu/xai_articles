  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 5 (APP): Stooping to a new low, the Sharif family has leveled serious allegations against Pakistan’s security establishment just to appease foreign forces and woo them to play a role to pull them out of legal quagmire.\nIn a fresh petition submitted before Islamabad High Court Tuesday, the PML-N leader Maryam Nawaz alleged country’s premier intelligence agency’s role in the conviction of Nawaz Sharif, herself as well as her husband Captain (Retd) Safdar in assets beyond means case.\nFollowing the exposure of Panama, Imran Khan, now prime minister, had filed a petition in the apex court which declared Nawaz Sharif unfit for holding office and ordered an accountability court to open references against him and his family, and other respondents.\nOn July 6, 2018, the Accountability Court Judge Mohammad Bashir had convicted the trio in the Avenfield Apartment reference and handed them jail terms of 10, seven and one years, respectively, for owning assets beyond known sources of income.\nSince then, the condemned the PML-N leader launched a tirade against Pakistan Army alleging their role in his ouster. Starting from his infamous dialogue of “Mujhe Kyun Nikala” Nawaz Sharif resorted to direct targeting of the military leadership.\nUndermining the sacrifices of thousands of lives in their anti-terror efforts, the Sharif family spoke filthy against the institution, which obviously drew applause from Indian and other anti-Pakistani media.\nThis time too, Maryam took to Twitter and shared the pages of her petition which she said had not been reported by media and said the “case/verdict against me was pre-planned, orchestrated and influenced by Gen. Faiz Hameed, the then DG [counter-intelligence],”.\nAlready notorious for her bloopers including Qatari letter and Calibri font, the PML-N leader drew ire of the Twitterati who termed her accusations as anti-Pakistan and tantamount to fanning the Indian narrative.\nSpecial Assistant to Prime Minister Dr Shahbaz Gill took to Twiiter and questioned the PML-N leader, as whether it was Faiz Hameed behind Sharif family’s busted cheats including Calibri font, Qatari letter produced before Supreme Court, forged money trail and her false claims of owning no property in Pakistan or abroad.\n“Dont impersonate Razia Sultana (first female Muslim ruler of subcontinent) just to conceal your corruption,” he commented.\n“This language and accent can only belong to an enemy of Pakistan. What is the reason for Indian and your narrative against the Pak Army is same ? Shame on you,” said a user Adnanpk.\n“Was it also Faiz Hameed who made you give statements like: What to talk of London, I have even no property in Pakistan.  Nawaz does not know how he brought the London flats where he lives in,” said another Twitterati Advocate Abdul Majeed.\n“True, it was Gen Faiz who on gunpoint asked you to utter: “Meri London To Kia Pakistan Main Bhi Koi Property Nahi..” And then he forced you to use Calibri font to forge documents and duped Sharif family to give Qatari letters & excel sheets as raseedain of London flats,” said user Umar in his tweet.\nThe Twitterati never missed a chance to bully the PML-N leader as in 2013, she tweeted that “Nawaz Sharif nominated for Nobel Peace Prize,” to which she got reply” “Have they launched Nobel for money laundering corruption cowardice?”",
