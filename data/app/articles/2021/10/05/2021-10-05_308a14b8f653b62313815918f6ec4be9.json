  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 5 (APP): The speakers at a seminar organized by Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) on Tuesday eulogised the struggle of Kashmiris and highlighted the mechanisms needed in the digital age to reach out to the world.\nWith Member of British Parliament Naz Shah as guest speaker at the lecture on ‘Fighting the Kashmir Cause: A StratComm Response’ along with Parliamentary Secretary for Law and Justice Maleeka Bokhari, the event focused on the Kashmir issue to be highlighted at international level through effective media campaigns and lobbying.\nShe said the need of the hour was to take Kashmir issue to the centre-stage, and vowed to do her bit in this regard as a legislator in the House of Commons.\nThe MP from Bradford West, who has walked the extra few miles to make an impact on issues concerning minorities and women in Britain, said that abrogation of Article 370 and 35-A were not just a law change, but had an impact on a generation struggling for its legitimate rights.\nShe regretted that even today, many in the world did not know the basics of Kashmiri struggle, and said that until and unless the social media and other forums were activated on the pattern of coverage of Gaza onslaught, nothing would change for good.\n“We need to project the issue in an objective manner, and a strategic shift is needed in explaining the Kashmir cause,” the MP stressed.\nKashmir as the most militarised zone in the world with a genocide taking place in it is unaddressed, she regretted.\nUnderscoring the need for a new media strategy, as well as lobbying in real time, Naz Shah observed that the initiative has to come from the grassroots level.\nMaleeka Bokhari assured the audience that the government of Pakistan will “use all lawful resources” to project the cause of Kashmir, and referred to the 131-page dossier that Islamabad had brought to fore on Kashmir, which documents 96,000 extra judicial killings, 11,200 rapes, 108,000 children orphaned and last but not least 20,000 widows.\nShe said rape was being used in Kashmir by the Indian security forces as a punishment tool, and a generation had been maimed.\nExecutive Director IPRI Dr Hussain Nadim and Acting President IPRI Brig (retd) Raashid Wali Janjua in their keynote addresses pointed out the efforts that IPRI as a think tank has done to strategize the Kashmir cause in the intellectual and social media realms.\nDr Hussain observed that a proper and more resolute strategy in communications was needed to make the world know the cause of Kashmir in its proper and scientific data-centric perspective.\nBrig Wali said the real story of Kashmir was yet to be told, and noted that a renewed effort was needed to rediscover the struggle from human perspective.",
