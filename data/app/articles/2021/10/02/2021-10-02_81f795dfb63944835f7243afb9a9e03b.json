Artisans from Pakistan have replicated pottery from the premodern period, and the organizers have prominently displayed these pieces at the pavilion.\n“People will keep walking through the facility without missing the lovely timeline that shows Pakistan’s history until it evolves into a modern-day state,” she continued.",
