With winter approaching, our hope is that these emergency supplies can support Pakistan’s efforts to assist the households affected as they recover from this natural disaster,” said Noriko Yoshida, UNHCR’s Representative.\nUNHCR’s work in Balochistan aims to support refugees and the host community, and the agency’s projects continue to support schools, clinics, and livelihoods shared by refugees and the host community.",
