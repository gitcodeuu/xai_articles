Federal government handled the challenges efficiently and ranked the third best among countries those managed the situation most efficiently, he added.\nFor ensuring relief to low income groups special measures were in offing and soon a comprehensive policy would be announced by the federal government in this regard, Sheikh said adding that important issues were deliberated upon in core committee meeting held with the prime minister in chair.\nThe low income groups and destitute persons would be provided targeted subsidies on items of daily use including wheat flour, sugar and petrol in a transparent manner and entire nation would be able to observe the positive impacts of federal government’s measures within a month or two, Haleem stated.\n“We will handle the issue of inflation in the same manner as we dealt with COVID-19 at the forefront,” he vowed.\nSpeaking, on the occasion, Khurram Sher Zaman said Prime Minister Imran Khan raised voice at international forums on the issue of sanctity of prophet-hood which was never done by rulers of the past.\nHe said that a true lover of Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) would never fail and Imran Khan who intended to develop Pakistan on lines of Riyasat-e-Madina will emerge as triumphant.\nHe said anti Pakistan forces were hatching conspiracies and opposition parties had joined their band wagon adding that opposition was harming the national interest in PTI’s hostility.\nBilal Gaffar said opposition parties were making hue and cry on inflation which was being driven by international dynamics. Global oil prices increased 90 percent while Pakistan allowed 23 percent increase, he noted.\nTo provide relief to poor PDL was being charged at Rs 5 per liter while rate of GST was lower to the possible level, he observed adding that government taxes on POL products were one fourth of the taxes charged in previous regimes, he added.\nState Bank of Pakistan has reported record surge in exports while it was confident that volume of annual exports and remittances would cross mark of US$ 30 billion in the current financial year, he said.\nBilal Gaffar said IMF and World Bank also forecast more than 5 percent GDP growth for Pakistan as federal government was not relying on engineered measures but taking consolidated efforts to deal with situation prudently and hoped that a new history of economic growth was in the making in Pakistan.",
