  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP): Taking the cover of several false flag “terrorist activities” in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K), Indian ministers are back to the business of hurling threats at Pakistan; warning it of more “surgical strikes.”\nIndian Union Home Minister Amit Shah, on Thursday in an address at Goa mentioned the incident at Poonch and said “there were a time talks happened, but now is the time to reciprocate.”\nHe cautioned Islamabad in his address and said that more such strikes would be invited by Pakistan should it choose to transgress.\nIndia, in the past, undertook several false flag operations; like the Pulwama and Uri attacks and blamed Pakistan; even leading to a botched attack on Balakot.\nThe recent spate of several low-level terrorist activities in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K), being closely monitored by security analysts, are seen as a precursor for major state-sponsored terrorist activity. The Indian stance has again caused a stir in the international circles, Pakistan and besieged Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K) population.\nKnown for his staunchly anti-Pakistan bias, Amit Shah said that under Prime Minister Narendra Modi and former Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar, a surgical strike was conducted. He termed it an ‘important step’ and said “We sent out a message that one should not disrupt India’s borders.”\nIndia claimed to have conducted a surgical strike in Pakistan across the Line of Control on September 29, 2016, in response to similar false flag terrorist attacks in Uri, Pathankot and Gurdaspur.\nSecurity analysts pointed to recent incidents which clearly indicate to an impending major state-sponsored terrorist activity that would inexplicitly involve Pakistan and create a legitimate environment for false flag operations against Pakistan.\nThe incidents precede situations and are aligned whenever there is some major activity in India like the state elections – in UP, domestic agitations against the government – the Farmers Protests,  mega defence, and other corruption scandals, diversion from gross human rights violations in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K) and mainland India.\nOn October 9, Human Rights Watch called for the alleged perpetrators as well as Indian security forces accused of abuses including harassment, torture and extrajudicial killings to be held accountable for their actions.\n“Kashmiris are caught in unending violence from attacks by militants and abuses by government authorities and security forces,” Human Rights Watch (HRW) south Asia director Meenakshi Ganguly said in a statement.\nThe recent killing of five Indian soldiers in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K), four of whom were Sikhs; including one Naib Subedar in the Rajouri sector was being seen as an attempt to divert Sikhs farmers attention from the recent killing of Sikhs in Lakhimpur towards anti-Pakistan sentiments.\nStrictly pursuing its agenda, the Indian media claimed arrest of, what they called, “Pakistani terrorist” by their agencies in Delhi on 11 October, and claimed he has been trained by Pakistan.\nHussain Nadim the head of Islamabad Policy Research Institute (IPRI) commenting on the alleged arrest of Mohammad Ashraf said for past few weeks Indian deep state was trying extra hard to build a narrative around the threat from “Pakistan based” terrorism.\n“False flag ops & propaganda are classic fascist tactics to repel domestic instability by escalating crisis on the borders,” he said in a tweet.\nThe core Indian objective of creating a false alarm mainly aims at diverting the attention of the international organization and the Muslim countries towards the grave nature of human rights violations against the minorities; particularly the Muslims in India and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).\nAn Indian social media handle @Panther7112 quoted “intel input” to suggest that Pakistan was planning a False Flag operation on the Line of Control. “Forces Are Prepared To Meet Any Challenges.” Interestingly the same text was used by similar sponsored handles.\nSecurity analysts believe that the setting of the scene by India was a clear indication of the direction the situation might take in the days ahead.\nHorrific videos of lynching of Muslim youth across India has sparked strong reaction amongst the social media users, however, the West remains unmoved as its economic and strategic interests outweigh the human rights abuses. On the other hand, India continues to play its part as a peace spoiler putting at risk the entire region.",
