To assist Ehsaas beneficiaries, One Window Ehsaas operations are being scaled up across all districts of the country including KP province,” said Dr Sania in an official statement.\n“The integration of all Ehsaas benefits and services under one roof is commendable. KP government will extend full support to Ehsaas for establishing One Window Ehsaas Centers in all districts of the province”, assured Dr Kazim Niaz.\nThe chief secretary was also given a round of the different offices, outlets, and desks at the Ehsaas Center whereby he witnessed all one window operations and met with Ehsaas team and beneficiaries.\nKP Secretary Social Welfare, Director General Khalid Siddique and other senior officials of Ehsaas also joined the visit.\nThe One Window Ehsaas has six pillars: a one stop shop, the Ehsaas physical centre; back office digital interface; a public facing digital information and services platform; a mobile app; an integrated database; and the Ehsaas one-window beneficiary selection and targeting policy.\nLast week, Dr Sania went to South Balochistan to explore sites for establishing One Window Centers of Ehsaas in border areas of the province.",
