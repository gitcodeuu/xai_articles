It is thus a key investment destination for countries around the world. Korean investors should also benefit from investment-friendly opportunities in Pakistan,” he emphasized.\nDuring the meeting, he appreciated the assistance and cooperation extended by the EXIM Bank of South Korea in initiating work on the construction of establishing the Information Technology Park at a cost of US$ 88.80 million in Islamabad.\nKeeping in view the recent evolving situation in Afghanistan, Sanjrani apprised the visiting dignitary that Pakistan has safely evacuated over 16000 foreign nationals through Pakistan, adding that Pakistan has also safely airlifted 392 Korean and Afghan nationals from Kabul, on the request of the Republic of Korea.\n“We are desirous of expanding and deepening trade and investment ties with Korea,” Sanjrani said.\nBoth sides stressed the need to further enhance parliamentary relations between the two countries through exchanges between parliamentary friendship groups to bring together parliaments of the two countries closers.\nHe also commended Korea’s efforts for the preservation and restoration of Ghandhara civilization in Pakistan.
