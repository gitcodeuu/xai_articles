Pakistan’s name had always been associated with corruption because of Nawaz Sharif, he added.\nGill said incompetent and ‘fugitive Mian’ had always been a source of embarrassment for the country. There were number of projects in which heavy kickbacks were taken by Sharif family, he said.\nHe said loans were borrowed at high interest rates for these projects to plunder national wealth. The people were still paying debts of these projects, he said.",
