Thirty years ago, there were over 350,000 cases of wild poliovirus each year.\nBacked by solid investments and political commitment, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI), of which Rotary International is a founding member, has helped bring the number of polio cases close to zero. Afghanistan and Pakistan are the last two countries left in the world to eliminate domestic strains of poliovirus.\nDespite the pervasive challenges of COVID-19, the world is in the final stage of polio eradication. Reaching to all children with vaccines is the only thing that can make the world polio-free, and it is possible through concerted efforts of parents, caregivers, and all stakeholders.\nPolio is a highly infectious disease caused by poliovirus mainly affecting children under the age of five years. It invades the nervous system and can cause paralysis or even death.\nWhile there is no cure for polio, vaccination is the most effective way to protect children from this crippling disease. Each time a child under the age of five is vaccinated, their protection against the virus is increased.\nRepeated immunizations have protected millions of children from polio, allowing almost all countries in the world to become polio-free.",
