Our friendship is a pace-setter for amicable relations between world countries,” he said while addressing a webinar titled ‘Seeking a brighter future for youth; A shared mission of political parties’.\nIt was arranged by the International Department of Central Committee of Communist Party of China.\nYouth exchange was a crucial part of bilateral relations, he said, adding the young people were potential driver for any country’s development.\nHe appreciated the CPC system which was built on merit and included more than 22 million young party members below 35 years. “It offers much opportunity for youth to get educated and promoted in the political system.”\nFarrukh said this merit-based system was highly appreciated by Prime Minister Imran Khan on multiple occasions. He had the same vision to build a mertit-based political system in Pakistan.\nHe said the slogan of ‘Naya Pakistan’ has political appeal for the middle class of the country to vote for change. The educated youth who voted for the PTI thought they had a glimpse of the light of future.

Out of these, 43 million are currently between ages 15-24,” he noted.\nHowever, this population faced constraints of poor education and skills, he added.\nHe said an amount of Rs 28 billion was released for the flagship KJP out of the total Rs 100 billion allocated to provide gainful employment and meaningful engagement to the young people.\nUnder the Kamyab Jawan program (KJP), he said the business index of 155 districts was prepared aimed to know the trend on districts’ choice of business.\nUnder the Vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan, he said an amount of Rs 10 billion were allocated for the task force of ‘Skill for All’ to provide 200,000 skill-based scholarships with the aim to bring the youth under digital skill net.\nThe minister said Rs 6.5 billion were released for the provision of skill-based scholarships to 100,000 youth.\nThe next phase of the ‘skill for all’ programme would be launched in near future, he added.\nThe National Youth Council (NYC) was formed to provide access to the country’s youth to power corridors and engage them in policy making process, he said, adding the government was extending financial and technical assistance to the youth for imparting trainings in high-tech trades and opening their own businesses in different sectors.\nThe minister said five new initiatives of the KJP were expected to be launched soon that would further expedite loan disbursement and youth engagement in economic activities.\nAfter the outbreak of COVID-19 in Pakistan, he the Pakistani government established the Tiger Force.\nThe force includes over 300,000 students, 133,000 social workers, 40,000 teachers and 17,000 health workers.\nTigers Force helped government to monitor the restriction and movement in areas of lockdown, Industries, Offices, Parks, Public transports, and other public movement places.\n“We will double the size of existing skill development & vocational training programmes,” he said, adding Rs100 billion have been allocated for youth loans under the programme.\nAbout the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), he said it was great opportunity for Pakistan. “CPEC connects us to China which is one of the biggest markets.”\nHe said the Special Economic Zones (SEZs) were being developed under the CPEC which would attract investment from across the globe.\nThe minister said China was a huge market and CPEC route would connect China and Pakistan located at strategic position of world.\nHe said that he was glad to know that IDCPC was scheduled to establish a platform for regional youth to get vocational training.\n“I am looking forward to leading a youth delegation of Pakistan to visit China in the near future,” he said.",
