  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 27 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain on Wednesday said that the top leadership has decided to treat the proscribed Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) as a ‘militant group’ on persistently challenging writ of the state by creating chaos with the support of anti-state elements.\n“On Tuesday, a clear policy decision was taken in a meeting, which was held under the chairmanship of Prime Minister Imran Khan and attended by the Pakistan Army, Intelligence Agencies and all the concerned authorities, that the proscribed Tehreek-e-Labaik will be treated as a militant group,” he said while addressing a post cabinet briefing here.\n“We will not treat this organization as a political party,” he said while urging other concerned departments especially the Election Commission of Pakistan to play their role in this regard.\nThe minister said, the matter pertaining to the organization would be dealt in a same manner as of other terrorist organizations that were annihilated in the past.\nFawad said Pakistan had defeated terrorist organizations like Al-Qaida in the past.\n“Therefore, make no mistake in considering Pakistan a weak state. Whosoever has committed mistake of perceiving Pakistan as a weak state, they regretted,” he added.\nReferring to long march of TLP on the Grand Trunk (GT) road, he said this was a proscribed organization and a militant group instead of religious one.\nThe proscribed TLP would not be allowed to challenge writ of the state at any cost.\nLast time, he said the government had made the details public as to how the social media accounts from India supported TLP.\nHe said, TLP soon after its origin in 2015 had become a pressure group to blackmail the government for their unjust demand.\nHe said the government of Pakistan and state had showed much restraint in the past to avoid bloodshed, but unfortunately there was a class in their leadership which paid no heed to the human loss because their purpose was a bloodshed and unrest in the country.\nLast time, he said some six policemen were killed and more than 700 got injured and now in last two day, two policemen embraced martyrdom and 49 inflicted injuries.\n“This is the six time, they are on roads and just a moment ago, 27 Kalashnikovs carrying people were seen participating in their march at Sadhoki,” he said while asking “Should we sit idle and allow you to come from one side and block GT road or another road. How long should it will be tolerated.”\nHe said the government had showed enough restraint and neither a civilian was hurt at a single place nor did resort to use force.\nAbout the decisions taken in the Federal Cabinet meeting, chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, he said it was decided in principle that nobody would be allowed to blackmail the state and nor would it be tolerated that the writ of state could be challenged by anyone.\nWarning those who running malicious campaign and fake news on social media networking sites especially Youtube, the minister said they should review their conduct.\n“We will not tolerate the culture of fake news being pursued by some people,” he said, adding “We will come hard on you.”\n“This will not be tolerated and we will go to any extent,” he said while terming the issue of fake news as a matter of national security and protection of lives of citizens.\nFawad said some miscreants were getting help from India and other countries to spread fake news. “We are contacting those countries and issued direction to PTA in that regard.\nResponding to a question, he said the government had already held six rounds of negotiations with TLP vagabonds in last two months sans any result.\nEnough is enough, mob rule could not be allowed in the country, he said adding that nobody has the right to block highways and unfortunately the name of the Holy prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) was being used for this act.\nHe quoted the famous saying of the holy prophet “Removing harmful things from the road is an act of charity (sadaqah).” Narrated by Abu Dharr Al-Ghafari.\nHe urged Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to take action against TLP.\nECP was scrutinizing funding sources of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) which was okay but they should also look into the registration of TLP, which is registered on name of a Dubai resident.\nA reference to declare TLP outlaw was ready and would be filed in Supreme Court of Pakistan soon, he said, adding that nobody would be allowed to enforce its agenda with force.\nTLP has no public support as in Khushab by elections they got only 1,400 votes.\nResponding to another query, Fawad urged media to play its role to expose such terrorist organisations, who are following agenda of inimical forces.\nThe main agenda of TLP was to destabilize the country as some 3.5 million tweets were posted in favour of TLP from India during their last protests.\nChaudhry Fawad Hussain said the cabinet has asked ECP to conduct forthcoming by elections in NA 133, Lahore through Electronic Voting Machines (EVM),adding another suggestion was to conduct Chamber of Commerce and Industry elections through EVM.\nThe cabinet has lamented the price control mechanism of Sindh government was very weak as edible items including flour, lentils were dearer than other provinces.\nThe flour bag being sold at Rs 380 per bag in Punjab was expensive than Sindh.\nHe said the cabinet has decided to make public the data of all provinces collected by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).\nThis would enable people to have comparison of prices in provinces. In comparison, prices were significantly cheaper in Punjab as comparing to other provinces.\nThe prices of edible items in Sindh were higher than any other province.\nHe said PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was leading protest demonstrations against price hike. But ironically, controlling the price hike was domain of provinces.\nBilawal should admonish his chief minister for price hike in Sindh.\nHe said it was heartening to note that the overall regional prices in Pakistan were cheaper than regional countries including India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, except ghee.\nCabinet has directed the concerned authorities to share a weekly comparison of regional prices with the people.\nFawad said the Ministry of National Food Security and Research briefed the cabinet about introducing modern technology in agriculture sector.\nThe cabinet was of the view that small farmers should be equipped to use modern technology in agriculture sector for getting maximum production.\nThe government has already increased the support price of wheat by Rs 500 per 40kg in last three years.\nA meeting would be held on Monday to discuss support price of wheat in the country.\nPakistan was seventh largest producer of wheat. Bumper crop of wheat and maize is expected this year.\nThe federal cabinet reviewed implementation on National Aviation Policy and decided to encourage vertical construction of buildings. Prime Minister emphasizes that vertical construction of building should be allowed.\nThe federal cabinet approved appointment of members in Expo Development Fund board for the period of one year.\nThe federal cabinet has approved conducting screening test of the candidates desiring to appear in CSS examinations.
