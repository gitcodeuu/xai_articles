  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 27 (APP): Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood on Wednesday presented to President Dr Arif Alvi a memento, highlighting the struggle and sacrifices of the Kashmiri people.\nThe memento by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs turned out to be a unique step of documenting the reign of India’s terror in Kashmir through art, but with a strong message for the world.\nThe memento comprised miniature figures of five icons depicting the struggle of Kashmiris including Hiba Nisar, the youngest victim of pellet guns fired by the Indian security forces, which had resulted in the loss of her eyesight.\nThe glass-encapsulated memento also showed Bashir Ahmed, a 65-years-old resident of Srinagar, who was martyred by the Indian occupation forces in front of his toddler grandson.\nThe dove with a flag of the United Nations highlighted the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination, while the clock in the background symbolized 815 days of the occupation of the Kashmir valley since August 5, 2019.\nThe clocktower of the Srinagar’s iconic Lal Chowk was placed as a witness to the struggle of several generations of Kashmiris.",
