The vehicle of union minister’s son Monu was burnt along with few others by the agitated mob.\nThe incident occurred on Sunday afternoon when over hundreds of farmers in Lakhimpur were marching towards Banvirpur locality where the Deputy Chief Minister of UP, K.P. Maurya was to arrive.\nThe Dy CM was to address a meeting of party workers in the area. The farmers had planned to stage demonstration in front of Maurya against farm bills. While farmers were on their way, a car allegedly owned by union minister’s son rammed in their procession injuring many.\nThis agitated the mob and they started creating ruckus. The irate mob of farmers set several vehicles ablaze and pelted stones.\nReacting on it the national president of Samajwadi Party Akhilesh Yadav said that time has come when farmers would not let any BJP leader enter in their areas. He said that union minister’s son was crushing farmers who were peacefully agitating.\nThe farmers’ protest against the Modi government’s farm laws has been surprisingly resilient. Protests began nearly a year ago in Punjab and they have been going on at Delhi’s borders.\nThe agitation has withstood police brutality, a pandemic, peak winter and summer and the deaths of several hundred protesters.\nThe farmers’ protests stemmed from the need to survive. Farmers see the protest as their last stand to defend their livelihood.\nThe Modi government has tried various means to get the farmers to back down – from several rounds of negotiations to offers of keeping the laws on hold for a while.\nBut the farmers have made it clear that they won’t settle for anything less than a complete repeal of the laws.",
