  "content": "The Foreign Minister underscored the significance of the essential role of NAM – an important international grouping dedicated to peace and development – to counter these challenges. The Foreign Minister called for a comprehensive and cooperative strategy to “build forward better” by addressing the need for vaccine equity, adequate financing for development, clear investment strategies, and focus on eliminating the structural and systemic inequalities.\nThe Foreign Minister expressed concern on the resurgence of great power tensions and a renewed global arms race. In the face of existential threats faced by humanity, he urged for the renunciation of anachronistic Cold War concepts of strategic competition, military alliances, global or regional dominance, foreign intervention and occupation.\nNoting NAM’s principled support for the right of self-determination of people living under foreign occupation, the Foreign Minister highlighted the situation in Palestine and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) where this right was being denied.\nHe called upon NAM and the international community to secure a just, peaceful and expeditious resolution of these long-standing disputes, in accordance with the resolutions of the UN Security Council and the aspirations of the people.\nThe Foreign Minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s firm commitment to NAM and its founding principles, which are as relevant today as they were 60 years ago, embodying the Movement’s collective aspiration for peace, equality, cooperation and well-being for all.\nThe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) was established in 1961 in Belgrade and is among the largest grouping of developing nations worldwide. Pakistan has been an active member of the forum, contributing extensively to its debates, positions and outcomes.",
