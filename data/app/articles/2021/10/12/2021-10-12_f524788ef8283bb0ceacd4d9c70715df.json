  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 12 (APP):Ambassador for Climate Change of Denmark Tomas Anker Christensen on Tuesday said the government of Denmark was negotiating with Pakistan to enhance bilateral cooperation and was working on addressing climate change and trade investment.\nHe was interacting with environmental journalists and young climate activists at the scenic Margalla Hills National Park’s Trail-4 and apprised the participants on Danish collaborative efforts and areas of interest brought under consideration for enhanced cooperation.\nChristensen said during his engagements with government officials three areas of interest were focused including enhanced bilateral collaboration vis-à-vis clean energy transition, environmental degradation and trade investment.\nHe said the Danish delegation at the 26th Conference of Parties (COP-26) would raise its voice the vulnerable and marginalized countries that needed investments for addressing environmental degradation.\n“Denmark has announced to augment its 1 percent share to the global climate fund pledged under the Paris Accord and hope that the developed countries should give their fair share in it,” he informed.\nChristensen underlined that Denmark was one of the largest countries to integrate wind power into its overall energy mix. The Danish government would like to have experience sharing with Pakistan to achieve its 30 percent renewable energy targets by 2030.\nHe added that a framework convention on energy was in the offing to streamline collaboration in energy sector, waste management, environmental issues and forestry investment.\nResponding to media queries, he said the Danish government was investing half of its green finance through multilateral organizations like Green Climate Fund (GCF), Global Environment Facility (GEF), Asian Development Bank and others in countries like Pakistan.\nHe commented that the countries like Denmark and Pakistan would achieve the Zero Emissions target which was not impossible but that would have least impact globally.\nHowever, the biggest polluters, G-20 nations needed to do more to cut their green house gas emissions driving global warming and climate change.  Chairperson Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB) Rina Saeed Khan, and Ambassador of Denmark Lis Rosenholm were also present on the occasion.\nThe Dansish envoys also did a brief walk on the Trail-4 and planted local species saplings at the entrance.",
