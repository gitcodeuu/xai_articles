The minister said there was close liaison between Pakistan’s military and political leadership and relationships were ideal.\nHe said that the cabinet made a land mark decision for approval of online power of attorney for overseas Pakistanis as this government had feelings for the problems faces by them in that regard.\nFawad said that in the past, no government ever bothered to resolve the problems of expatriates but the present government had attached special priority to settle their issues.\nIt was the PTI government which took steps for repatriation of hundreds of Pakistani prisoners languishing in foreign jails in petty crimes, he added.\nThe minister said that another important development was that the cabinet was given presentation for setting up a new unit in Islamabad police for mob handling.\nThis unit would be well trained and equipped with latest technology including drones and cameras to ensure that the residents of the capital were protected from such riots and they do not face inconvenience of road closures every now and then, he added.\nHe said that Supreme Court had imposed ban on protests at D-Chowk but still a handful people block the road there whenever they like. The new unit would be a very good initiative to protect the capital from protesters, he added.\nFawad said the Cabinet had decided to include the traders coming from Afghanistan to Pakistan in visa list as the volume of goods being traded between the two countries had increased manifold.\nThe government, he said was keen to encourage the legal entry of Afghan people coming to Pakistan by bringing ease in visa regime to the convenience of the Afghan nationals.    Similarly, the minister said the Cabinet had okayed the code of conduct for visa issuance to Afghan nationals.\nThe visa process for Afghan nationals had also been made online due to the huge influx of people coming to the Pakistan Embassy for the issuance of visas, he added.\nThe minister said the cabinet also approved the proposal to give online visas to foreigners working on various China Pakistan Economic Corridor projects and decided to write off visa fee for Afghan nationals.\nHe said the Cabinet also approved the reconstitution of the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) Council of Complaints, Islamabad. Syed Muhammad Ali Bukhari would be the chairman of the council while Journalist Mazhar Barlas, Naeem Khan, and three women Nighat Saeed, Batool Zain,\nand (Tallat Azeem) had been made members to the council, he added.

The minister said that the authority would work for promotion of the traits of tolerance and coexistence in the masses.\nThe love for the Holy Prophet was part and parcel of faith of every Muslim, who was ‘Rehmatulil Aalimeen’ not ‘Rehmatulil Muslimeen’ but unfortunately this image could not be highlighted in Pakistan in the past, he added.\nFawad said objective of this authority would be to mold the characters of the young generation in the light of the ‘Seerat-un Nabi’ (PBUH). It would not be a traditional authority, top scholars from not only Pakistan but from all over the world would be its members, he added.\nThe minister said that the narrative that Islam spread through love, affection and respect and honor of the other people would be promoted and rights of minorities, women and children should be protected.\nHe said that at the outset, the federal cabinet offered ‘Fateha’ for the soul of renowned nuclear scientist Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan. Over 15 ministers including National Assembly Speaker, Senate Chairman, Chairman of Joints Chiefs of Staff Committee, and Naval chief attended the funeral.\nIt was unfortunate that there was a tendency on social media to make news from rumours sans verifying the facts, he added.\nHe appealed to the journalists to demonstrate responsibility and verify the news circulating on social media before reporting to their respective organizations to counter fake news and propaganda.\nThe minister said that cabinet was given briefing on electronic voting machines.
