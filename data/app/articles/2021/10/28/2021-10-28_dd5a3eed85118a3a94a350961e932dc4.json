  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 28 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain on Thursday ruled out possibility of negotiations with proscribed Tehreek-e-Labbaik (TLP) until it cleared all the roads and handed over the culprits, who martyred policemen during recent clashes.\nFawad made the announcement in a tweet while urging patriots to distance themselves away from the ongoing protests of the proscribed TLP and return home instead of becoming part of a campaign which as tantamount to terrorism against state.\nMeanwhile, in another tweet, the minister, responding to a journalist’s question, made it clear that there was a difference between protest of a ‘political party’ and a ‘proscribed party’.\nHe also cited the example of protest launched by different political parties including the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\nAll those political movements were not armed, he said, adding it was unfortunate that some ‘half baked intellechawals’ were trying to portray ‘terrorism’ of a banned organization as a ‘political matter’.",
