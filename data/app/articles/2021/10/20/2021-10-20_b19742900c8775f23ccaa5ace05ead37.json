To deliver cash to 15 million families amid COVID-19, the digital capabilities established in year 2019 as part of Ehsaas, were adapted to deliver Ehsaas Emergency Cash particularly a new biometric payment system, a demand side SMS based request seeking platform and a new wealth profiling big data analytics mechanism”, Dr. Sania said.\nFurther, drawing on lessons learnt from the programme implementation during COVID-19, Dr. Sania added, “Using the same system, we have upscaled our education conditional as well as the health and nutrition conditional cash transfer programmes nationwide despite the financial constraints imposed by COVID.\nAlso, stipends are skewed to favor girls’ education. Even when COVID-19 was raging, we completed the work on Ehsaas survey, based on which are expanding our social protection operations.”\nThe key lesson, she emphasized, was that to execute well at scale, data and technology are only part of the solution, it is how you plug them in a context of systems, policy and partnership innovations and the execution diligence that matters for delivery.\nThe Conclave was opened by the World Bank Group President, David Malpass.Ministers of Finance and Planning from over 80 Human Capital project countries, key development partners, other high-level officials, and the World Bank’s senior leadership attended the event.\nThe 2021 Conclave on “Arresting Human Capital Losses due to COVID-19: Reimagining Service Delivery in a Digital Age”, focused on how countries can make the most of the Digital age, making smart investment decisions around technology and innovations for services that better protect, build and utilize human capital.\nAccording to the World Bank, Pakistan’s Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme was also ranked fourth globally in terms of the number of people covered and 3rd globally in terms of percentage of population covered amongst those that covered over 100 million people.\nAlongside Dr. Sania, Dr. Olavo Avelino Garcia Correia, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, Business Development, and Digital Economy, Cabo Verde; Sri Mulyani Indrawati, Minister of Finance, Indonesia; Nasser Shraideh, Minister of Planning and International Cooperation, Jordan; Amb.
