FATF chief also acknowledged government’s commitment to get off Grey List, he added.\nHe said Pakistan was put in FATF’s Grey List due to not controlling money laundering during tenure of the past rulers. Even the past rulers were also involved in money laundering instead of controlling it, he added.\nGill expressed the hope that Pakistan would get out of the Grey List owing to the steps taken by the government under the leadership of PM Imran Khan.\nHe said the past rulers filled their personal account by borrowing from International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nThe so called economic Aristotle bankrupted the economy as well as the country, he said.",
