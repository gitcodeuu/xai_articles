This is a month of blessings.”\nAlso known as Eid Miladun Nabi, the 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal is celebrated by Muslims as the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him).\nAllah gave Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) the title of Rahmatullil Alameen, who brought together the whole humanity, he added.\nHe said, “Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is a great leader in the history of the world. The great quality of a leader is that he brings together humans and does not spread hate.”\n“So I want all Pakistanis to fully participate in the celebrations of 12 Rabiul Awal,” he said adding the celebrations of this year should be unprecedented in the history of Pakistan.\n“My message to the people is that everybody should take part in the celebrations,” the PM said and asked the whole nation, media, minorities and others to participate in the celebrations.\nRecently, while addressing the Ashra-e-Rehmatullil Aalameen (PBUH) conference here, the prime minister had also announced the formation of Rehmatullil Aalameen (PBUH) Authority comprising of local and international scholars.\nThe objective of the Authority is to spread the Prophet’s (PBUH) teachings among children and adults, educate the world on Holy Prophet’s (PBUH) life, promote culture of fairness and accountability, monitor schools’ curriculum and promote research in universities on Seeratun Nabi (PBUH).\nThe formation of the said Authority is being considered as an excellent initiative to address all the challenges faced by Muslim world in general including Islamophobia and blasphemy.\nFollowing the path of Sunnah under guidance of enlightened and moderate scholars from all over the world will serve as a befitting response to hostile intelligence agencies and states working on dividing Muslims all over the world along sectarian lines.\nThe prime minister had also announced that this year, the history’s biggest ever ceremony would be held to mark the Eid Miladun Nabi (PBUH) with full religious zeal and zest.\nThe prime minister’s initiative is an important development towards restoring values of fairness and justice in a society.\nThe official 10-day celebrations of Eid Miladun Nabi are welcoming and a step in right direction within a society that has been polarizing along religious lines.",
