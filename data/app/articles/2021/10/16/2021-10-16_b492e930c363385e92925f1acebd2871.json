And also Pakistan needs US$ 6-14 billion for climate smart agriculture,” he added.\nMalik Amin said despite climate change impact, covid-19 and debt crisis, Pakistan has shown remarkable progress on the climate action that has been appreciated by the World Bank, besides other international forums. According to a World Bank report Pakistan’s climate friendly development goes beyond 44 percent at the moment which was the highest on the world map, said Amin Aslam.\nDuring the webinar, the experts and civil society representatives speaking at a national webinar on Saturday mentioned that Pakistan government has set an ambitious Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) for the 26th Conference of Parties (COP-26) under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) being organized in Glasgow (UK).\nHowever, they urged the government to make such decisions more inclusive and participatory by engaging different stakeholders in the pre-decision process.They said reducing carbon emissions was the one goal under the UNFCCC but there was also need to take into account the causes and impact of natural disasters and calamities the different parts of the country being faced over a decade.\n“Climatic conditions are making Pakistan more vulnerable to natural disasters. Financial and technical support to such issues shall also be part of the country’s NDC,” the experts underlined.\nDevcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed hosted and moderated the discussion. The guest speakers included WWF Pakistan Director Environment Dr. Imran Khalid, Assisstant Professor Dr Nilofar Jamil (Quetta), Assistant Professor Dr Khushboo Ejaz (Lahore), Marine Ecology expert Shahid Amjad (Karachi), senior scientist Global Change Impact Study Centre (GCISC) Dr. Muhammad Amjad , National Defense University Asstt. Professor Dr Imran Ashraf, SDGs Academy chairman Ammar Jafri, Development expert Aftan Alam Khan and Art and Design senior teacher Riffat Ara Baig.\nDevcom-Pakistan Executive Director Munir Ahmed said widely inclusive and participatory approaches needed to develop NDCs. Pre-COP events shall include vigorous participation to propagate the country’s NDCs, financial and technical needs to influence the donors.\nPakistan’s policy framework is much appreciable that shall be implemented in letter and spirit taking all stakeholders on board.\nMunir said public awareness and inter-disciplinary coordination on climate change and its impacts, and relevant international and multilateral forums is very vital. Only a limited number of professionals know about Pakistan’s policy framework while there is a huge void to engage youth, the 63 percent of the population.\nAftab Alam Khan urged the government to make CPEC projects climate friendly and curtail coal-fired power plants. The civil society organizations shall be engaged in the international negotiation processes.\nDr Zaigham Habib said water development and management is on the low priority for which the country has to suffer severely. Glacial melting is on the rise while GLOF-II could not take up required measures despite available huge funding. There is no substantial coordination among the federal and sub-national governments, inter-ministerial and coordination with other stakeholders.",
