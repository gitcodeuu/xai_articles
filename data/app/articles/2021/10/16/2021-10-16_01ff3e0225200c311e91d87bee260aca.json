There will be two-way data sharing; agencies with whom data will be shared will also be required to update the registry with their own information.\nThe NDEP will also be connected to the databases of other federal agencies enabling real-time beneficiary information validation, such as NADRA, Utility Stores Corporation and Mobile Point of Sale system of National Bank.\nHence, the same data exchange platform will underpin the rollout of the forthcoming Ehsaas targeted commodity subsidies program in collaboration with Utility Stores Corporation and National Bank of Pakistan.\nThrough this national scale data sharing platform, the executing agencies of Ehsaas will be able to access data from the unified registry in real-time to validate beneficiary information.",
