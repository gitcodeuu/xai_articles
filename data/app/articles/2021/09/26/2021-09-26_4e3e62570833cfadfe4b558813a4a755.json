My mission here is to sensitize the international community, as well as the civil society, on the grave and systematic human rights violations taking place in the IIOJK,” Afridi said.\n“Since 05 August 2019, there is a wall of secrecy, a military siege and communication blockade imposed on IIOJK. Behind this iron curtain, crimes against humanity are being committed in IIOJK, not just human rights violations. These include mass killings, blindings, rape, illegal detention of thousands of political activists, torture and degrading treatment,” he said.\n“Our outreach to the European Parliament, UK House of Commons, even US Congress and ASEAN parliaments has been successful,” said Afridi.\nHe said due to selectivity and double standards, human rights have been reduced to instruments of strategic and foreign policy.\n“Recently, a debate on Kashmir was held in UK House of Commons in which speaker after speaker emphasised to put an end to the oppression, genocide and war crimes in Kashmir. But would 10 Downing Street listen to them,” argued Afridi.\n“If India has nothing to hide why is not giving access to HRW, Amnesty International and Physicians for Human Rights in the occupied so that they could make an independent assessment of the situation there. The Office of High Commissioner and Human Rights Council have been denied entry,” he said.\nAfridi said to further its plans, over 4.2 million fake domicile certificates have been issued already under the so-called “Jammu and Kashmir Grant of Domicile Certificate (Procedure) Rules, 2020” with an objective to change the demography of the occupied territory.\n“The most recent example of Indian barbarity was the treatment of mortal remains of the great Kashmiri leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani.\nHis body was forcibly snatched by the Indian army and his family was denied the right of a proper funeral and burial. The Government of India was so afraid of Syed Geelani and what he stood for that they resorted to this inhumane act even after his passing away,” he concluded.",
