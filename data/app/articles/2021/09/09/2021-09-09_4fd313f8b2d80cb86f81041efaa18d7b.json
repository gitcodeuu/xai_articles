He single-handedly changed the course of history by instilling a spirit of freedom in every Kashmiri,” he remarked.\nShehryar Afridi said that Indian genocide plan in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) could not kill the free spirit of the Kashmiri nation.\n“India may have killed Syed Ali Geelani in custody and buried him without his family attending his funeral but India could not bury his soul. Today, every single Kashmiri is Geelani. This struggle is continuous and will continue till Kashmir gets freedom from illegal Indian occupation,” he said.\nHe added that the recent triumph of Afghan Taliban had once again proved that no invading power, even the sole super power of the world, could hold a nation slave if the invaded nation was committed to fight for freedom till the end.\nHe said that global dynamics were changing and the day was not far when Kashmiris would be free from illegal Indian occupation.\n“Pakistan stands by Kashmiris through thick and thin. Pakistan will employ all diplomatic and political tools to help the Kashmiris’ cause of freedom,” asserted the Chairman of Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir.\nKashmiri activist Dr Ghulam Nabi Fai said that Syed Ali Geelani was steadfast in his devotion to Kashmir cause and he was highly impressed by the dedication and commitment of Quaid-e-Azam Mohammad Ali Jinnah.\nHe alleged that the Modi’s might could neither intimidate nor purchase Geelani Sahab. Dr. Ghulam Nabi Fai said that Geelani was an uncompromising Kashmiri leader which added a new chapter to the Kashmiri history.\nQuoting various articles published in the leading Western media outlets, Dr Fai said that the international media highlighted the sacrifices made by Syed Ali Geelani and also articulated the clear vision of Geelani about Kashmiri freedom movement.\nHe emphasized his faith that the people of IIOJK would always stay committed to the path led by Syed Ali Geelani.\nGlowing tributes to Syed Ali Geelani were paid by IRS President Ambassador Nadeem Riyaz to Syed Ali Geelani. Ambassador Nadeem added that Ali Geelani used to live a simple life but he was a beacon of resistance for Kashmiri resistance leaders.\nHe said that Kashmir was the longest unfinished agenda at the UNSC and it had to be settled.Ambassador Afrasiab, Iftikhar Gilani, the son in law of Syed Ali Geelani, Fauzia Yaqoob and Dr Shaheen Akhtar also addressed the webinar.",
