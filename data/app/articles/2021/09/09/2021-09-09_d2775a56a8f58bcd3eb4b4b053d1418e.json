  "content": "ISLMABAD Sep 9, (APP): People of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir will pay their final respects to the veteran Kashmiri freedom fighter Syed Ali Shah Geelani at his grave in Hyderpora on Friday, September 10.\nPeople of the occupied valley will also protest against the snatching of his body by the Indian occupation forces and his burial against the wishes of his family, without observing Islamic rites.\nThere was a lot of resentment among the people over the desecration of the body of Ali Shah Geelani.The callous and demeaning behaviour of the Indian forces was a severe violation of the article 17 of the Geneva convention of 1949.\nAccording to the article regarding the dead, “They shall further ensure that the dead are honourably interred, if possible according to the rites of the religion to which they belonged, that their graves are respected, grouped if possible according to the nationality of the deceased, properly maintained and marked so that they may always be found.”\nThe Indian army not only snatched and dragged his body but also tortured his family members. They committed another unspeakable crime by not allowing the family members to attend the burial of the veteran Kashmiri leader.",
