Any attempts to associate terrorism with any particular people, nationality, civilization, religion, race or ethnicity are condemnable. The new and emerging threats in the form of right-wing, Islamophobia, domestic, racially or ethnically motivated and other forms of extremist tendencies leading to terrorism necessitate effective responses around the world.”\nHe said in order to completely eradicate terrorism, it was vital to eschew double standards, myopic and selective approaches and vested, narrow political agendas.\nHe reminded that Pakistan had been an active partner of the international community in the global fight against terrorism over the last two decades. “Pakistan has played a leading role in this struggle and has demonstrated its earnest commitment through unprecedented sacrifices in the form of over 80,000 casualties and economic losses of over $ 150 billion. No other country in modern history has played a matching role in combating terrorism.”\n“We also condemn in strongest possible terms the terrorist attacks that have taken place in Pakistan, especially over the past few months, which were planned and supported from across our borders. Pakistan has exposed the planners, supporters and financiers of terrorist incidents committed on its soil and will continue to do so in future.”\nPakistan was also resolved to continue its efforts for consolidating the gains achieved in the fight against terrorism, including by thwarting the designs of the spoilers of peace who, driven by extremist ideology and geo-political agendas, use terrorism as an instrument of state policy.\nHe assured Pakistan will continue to play its rightful role in the fight against terrorism in all its forms and manifestations and for the maintenance of peace and security in the region and beyond.",
