Syed Ali Gillani was a stalwart of the Kashmiri struggle.\nHe stood against the aggression of Indian forces. He was a 90 years old young man. Nobody could break his will and determination for freedom, Ali said.\nHe continued his peaceful struggle for freedom. We should condemn the way his funeral processions and burial has been treated. His family has been tortured and brutalized even at his funeral, the minister added.\nAli Muhammad said Indian security forces are using inhuman tactics against the people of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe UN, OIC, and other global forums should speak for the Kashmiri people, he said, adding, the message he left will remain a symbol of guidance for all the times to come.",
