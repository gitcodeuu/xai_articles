If eligible, they can collect their cash from the nearest Ehsaas payment centres.” Ehsaas 8171 web-portal: ehsaastracking.pass.gov.pk.\nHouseholds are rejected or included in the Ehsaas cash transfers based on the information collected in the survey.\nEhsaas registration desks have been opened at Tehsil level nationwide to facilitate households, who could not participate in the survey for some reasons.\nThey can self-register themselves by contacting the Ehsaas registration desks.\nThis year 12 million deserving households are being paid Ehsaas cash grants on the basis of Ehsaas survey.\nDr. Sania also visited a payment campsite in Chappalgram area of Battagram to witness Ehsaas cash disbursements being made to eligible Ehsaas beneficiaries.\nShe met with beneficiaries who were withdrawing Ehsaas cash with eligibility letters in their hands and 8171 messages on cell phones.\nShe also guided them about the Ehsaas benefits for eligible families particularly entitlement of their school/ college going children aged 4-22 under Ehsaas Education Stipends.\n“Rolled out in 160 districts across the country, the recently launched Ehsaas Education Stipends programme has been structured to give a higher amount of stipend to girls, as compared to boys.\nThe primary school going boys get a quarterly stipend of Rs.1,500 and girls Rs.2,000; secondary school boys receive Rs.2,500 and girls Rs.3,000; and at higher secondary level, boys get Rs.3,500 and girls Rs.4,000”, Dr. Sania said while creating awareness about the education benefits under Ehsaas.\nAt the Ehsaas Tehsil office in Police Lines area of Battagram, she also reviewed the enrollment of children hailing from Ehsaas eligible families for Ehsaas Education Stipends.\nCheckmating collusion and pilferage, the programme has been made end-to-end digital.
