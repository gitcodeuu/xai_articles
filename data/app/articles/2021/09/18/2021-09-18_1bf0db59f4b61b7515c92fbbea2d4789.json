In her remarks, Dr. Nishtar mentioned that Covid-19 had deeply imprinted lives of people across the globe, but its the deepest weight fell disproportionately on the poor.\nDr. Nishtar highlighted that there was no formal mechanism of experience sharing between ministries of poverty alleviation and social assistance, adding that multilateral system social protection was almost an orphan area in terms of government-to-government exchanges.\nTherefore, she said, the intention was to launch a global government-to-government social protection platform as a starting point to achieve universal social protection.\nDr. Nishtar added, “The Global Social Protection Platform will be a new initiative currently filling an important knowledge gap in the global social protection landscape. Countries can get direct exposure to global knowledge on a regular basis through this channel. A light Secretariat will support agenda-setting, demand detection and content formulation, logistics and planning, and communication”.\nEarlier, Permanent Representative of Pakistan Ambassador Munir Akram, in his welcome remarks highlighted the need for universal social protection.\nHe referred to social protection measures as economic imperative and not mere moral obligation.\nAmbassador Akram also pointed out that almost four billion people around the world were without any form of social protection, adding that the world must redouble efforts to achieve social protection for all by 2030.\nHe emphasized that a new era for social protection systems would be a foundation for inclusive and sustainable societies and for achieving our overarching objectives of “leaving no one behind” and “eradicating extreme poverty”.\nThe World Bank as technical partner of the group highlighted the significance of social protection instruments all over the world.\nThe representative of the World Bank, Ugo Gentilini praised Pakistan’s Ehssas programme being among the top four social protection programmes around the world.\nGentilini also mentioned that the pandemic has laid the foundation for the need for universal social protection as today more and more countries are enhancing their social protection efforts.\nDuring the event, several countries supported Pakistan for taking a leadership position on universal social protection.\nThey also emphasized that Covid-19 crisis has provided an inflection point in history to pursue social protection for all and this momentum must not be lost. Many countries indicated their readiness to join the declaration to establish a “Global Social Protection Knowledge Platform”.\nIn coming months, Pakistan along with partner countries would work on adoption of the declaration to establish a “Global Social Protection Knowledge Platform”, to share the best practices around the world and to create a global hub of knowledge.",
