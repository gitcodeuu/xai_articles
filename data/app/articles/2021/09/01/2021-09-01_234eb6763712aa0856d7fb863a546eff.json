The courts did not suspend their sentence in the corruption cases and they were out on bails, he added.\nHe said Shahbaz Sharif openly sought NRO concession yesterday by proposing setting up national government.\nHowever, the SAPM categorically said that No NRO would be given to the corrupt leaderships at any cost although they were using EVMs for bargaining.\nHe said EVMs would also be utilized during press clubs, bars, clubs elections.\nHe said media persons would be invited in next few days for giving practical demonstration about EVMs.\nGill said that Shahbaz Sharif should tendered resignation from the PML-N president slot as the party has rejected his statement. He said Marayam Aurangzeb has become personal secretary to Marryam Safdar.",
