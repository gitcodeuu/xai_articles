KCCDZ would be a flagship project for not only Pakistan but also the entire region. He said KCCDZ would also provide residential resettlement to more than 20,000 families living in the surrounding slums.\nThe environment friendly mega KCCDZ envisaged four new berths for KPT. It would also house a state-of-the-art fishing port with a world class fisheries export processing zone to boost Pakistan’s trade potential.\nIt would also improve marine ecosystem and reduce pollution. KCCDZ would connect rest of Karachi through a majestic harbour bridge rising from behind Pakistan’s Deepwater Port with exit ramps for Manora Island and Sandspit Beach.\nKCCDZ had also enormous potential for global investors. It would unlock Pakistan’s unexplored Blue Economy and significantly enhance development and industrial cooperation between the two countries.",
