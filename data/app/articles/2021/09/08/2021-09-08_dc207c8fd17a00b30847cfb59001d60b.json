It can work without electricity with a battery backup of 24 hours.\nTo another question, the minister said that a total 400,000 EVMs would be required to hold 2023 general elections in the country, adding that at present the manufacturing capacity of these machines was 2000 units daily and within five to six months the 400,000 machines could be manufactured.\nHe said that out of 37 recommendations made by the Election Commission of Pakistan to the committee asked for the enhancement of its capacity, while only 10 suggestions belonged to EVMs which had already been addressed.",
