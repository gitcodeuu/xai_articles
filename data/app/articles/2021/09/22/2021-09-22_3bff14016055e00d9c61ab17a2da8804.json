  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 22 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan has urged the international community to seize the great opportunity for bringing stability in Afghanistan by supporting, encouraging and incentivizing the Taliban government so that they could fulfill their promises.\nThe prime minister further stressed that the international community must realize situation in Afghanistan which could spiral out of control if not supported by them.\nThe prime minister was responding to different questions in a BBC programme hosted by John Simpson. A part of programme was earlier broadcast by the British television network on Tuesday.\nTo a query, the prime minister said the international community must support and encourage the transition government in Afghanistan to fulfill their promises, they had made regarding forming of an inclusive government, safeguarding the human rights including women’s rights and that Afghan’s soil would not be used against any country by the terrorists.\n“What will happen in Afghanistan now, no one can tell. Where Afghanistan will go from here, no one can predict,” he observed stressing that the country required peace and stability to move on.\nHe further said, “I’m afraid, I’m not in position to tell what will happen.”\n“We are quite tense. Our biggest worry is the looming issue of refugees,” Prime Minister Khan’s said sharing his concerns if the peace and stability did not return to the war torn country after twenty years of chaos and civil war.\nResponding to another query, he said that in his view, Taliban came into power after 20 years of civil power, so they required some time.\nTaliban knew it very well that if they wanted peace and stability, they required to include all Afghan groups in the government, he added.\nTo another question, he maintained that Afghanistan survived on bulk of international aid. There were factions within Taliban and those at the helm of affairs had been trying to get an international acceptability.\nAbout recognizing Taliban’s government, PM Khan said that the neighbouring countries would take a collective decision in this regard.\n“All neighbours will get together and see how they progress. Whether to recognize them or not will be a collective decision,” he maintained.\nHe explained that during his recent visit to Tajikistan, he spoke to the neighbouring countries and the president of Tajikistan, and they had decided to take a collective decision about Taliban set up.\nHowever, he added that it would depend upon formation of an inclusive government in Afghanistan, respect for the human rights and that Afghan soil would not be used for terrorism.\nThe prime minister said that Taliban had not got an inclusive government so far still they hoped that they would have it.\nSo far, there was an interim set up, he said, adding that they were trying to speak to them to have an inclusive government.\nPM Khan emphasized that long-term peace and stability would be elusive unless there was an inclusive government.\n“Peace is a key to everything,” he underlined, adding that Afghan society required peace as civil war had destroyed everything.\nTo a question regarding women’s rights, he said religion of Islam had protected their rights. The Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) had freed slaves and ensured rights to minorities.\nThe issue that women should not get education, was not Islamic, he said, elaborating that it was a rural culture in Afghanistan.\n“I think they will allow women to go to schools,” he said, adding “The idea that women should not be educated is not Islamic. It has nothing to do with religion.”\nWhat they were referring in the religious context was related to segregation of males and females, he added.\nExpressing his optimism, he added that Taliban would do it in phases.\nHe said Taliban’s statements had been very encouraging as they had promised that womenfolk could go to work, there would be an inclusive government and their soil would not be used by anyone for terrorism.\nTo another question, the prime minister said Afghans are very sturdy race. They had never accepted any interference from outside and they could not be controlled outside.\nThe US led-coalition forces wanted to find a military solution to the Afghan issue which was not there. The US could not achieve it through use of military force, he added.\nThe prime minister said after 9/11, Pakistan sided with the US and had suffered more than any other coalition partners of US.\nPakistan lost 80,000 precious lives in that war. All the logistical support to the US and ISAF forces went through Pakistan, he said, adding as an ally, Pakistan was targeted by dozens of different militant and terrorist groups.\nThe reason Taliban came into power, not because of Pakistan, but it had its own circumstances, he added.\nThe prime minister said after the Soviets left Afghanistan, Pakistan hosted about five million Afghan refugees, most of them were Pashtuns.\nThe tribal areas of Pakistan sided with Taliban and this part of the country had turned against Pakistan when it decided to side with the US, he said while explaining one of the reasons for militancy and terrorism in the country after 9/11.\nHe said for the first time, in history, 90 per cent of Pak border with Afghanistan had been fenced by his government.\nThe prime minister, to another query, said that his government had introduced one curriculum for the whole country and after seventy years, the nation had the unified educational system.\nHe said that his earlier statement in this context was wrongly projected.\nAbout the visit of ISI director general to Afghanistan, the prime minister said it was taken in the context that Afghan soil should not be used for terrorism against Pakistan.\nHe said that three different terrorist groups had been attacking Pakistan from Afghan soil. These included ISIS, TTP and fugitive terrorists from Balochistan province.\nRemnants TTP elements had been pushed out of Pakistan and they were conducting attacks from Afghan’s soil. They had attacked the Chinese workers which was a very serious terrorist attack, he added.\nAbout ties with India, the prime minister reiterated that Pakistan would not talk to Indian unless it revoked its illegal and unilateral steps of August 5, 2019 over Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nIndia had defied and violated United Nations Security Council resolutions regarding holding of plebiscite in the occupied territory and the promise it made to the international community.\nThe prime minister also rejected the Indian propaganda that Taliban government in Afghanistan could have any impacts upon IIOJK.",
