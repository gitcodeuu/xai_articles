  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 22 (APP):Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar on Wednesday apprised the National Assembly that the supply of gas from indigenous sources was depleting rapidly and during the last financial year an average of around 900 MMCFD was available to Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL) whereas currently it was around 800 MMCFD.\nReplying to various questions during Question Hour, he said the gap between supply of indigenous gas and consumption by various sectors was therefore, bridged through injection of RLNG in SNGPL’s network.\nDue to pipeline capacity constraint, a maximum 1200 MMCFD of RLNG could be transported. SNGPL placed orders of LNG import for maximum available capacity during eight peak months, while remaining four months were relatively lean demand months, he said.\nHe said currently 70 per cent LNG was being procured through long term contracts and 30 per cent through spot cargoes purchase.\nHowever, he said from the next month, 90 per cent LNG would be purchased through long term contracts resulting saving of billions of rupees.\nThe minister said that currently, there was no storage facility of LNG in the country and underground storage facility would be set up.",
