It maintains a data-driven, growth-oriented team to further the interests of the State of Pakistan locally and internationally. It strengthens the government for the 21st century with robust, authentic, and high-quality online communication platforms.\nThe DMW is also responsible for creating the digital content for official social media of the government of Pakistan on Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, and Instagram. It is organizing and verifying the social media accounts of all federal government ministries besides enhancing their digital media presence.\nIt is also working on capacity building of Federal Ministries on Digital Media including Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Instagram. The DMW team is in direct coordination with the Public Relations Officers and covers daily important press conferences, activities, meetings, and events of Federal Ministers on Digital Media.\nZaheer Ahmed, a social media user talking to APP said that this platform was a powerful mode across the world including Pakistan to highlight any issue. But, he viewed that sometimes this important tool was misused by transmitting disinformation to malign someone.He said there should be some criteria to control such elements.\nAccording to Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA), Chairman Maj Gen (Retd.) Amir Azeem Bajwa, a response from social media platforms was usually in accordance with their own community guidelines and not in compliance with the laws of Pakistan.\nAs per the law, the PTA had a responsibility to protect citizens from online harm in accordance with the local laws and societal norms, he added. However, he asked social media companies to respect the laws of Pakistan.\nKeeping in view, the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan of digitalization, the IT Ministry, through NITB, is in a process of rolling out the e-Office suite in the Federal Government to ensure efficiency, accuracy, effectiveness, good governance, transparency, and accountability in decision making and delivery of efficient and cost-effective public services to citizens of Pakistan.\nIn this regard, access to e-office suite software has been provided to more than thirty-one Ministries/Divisions and 50 attached departments whereby more than 10500 staff has been trained on the said e-governance system.\nThe numbers of IT companies have increased to 4641 as of 30 June 2021 compared to 1762 valid registrations as of 30 June 2018.\nIn Pakistan, according to PTA, the number of active cellular mobile subscribers reached 185 million by July 2021. The number of broadband subscribers reached 104.43 million in July while the broadband penetration was recorded at 47.68 percent during the same period.",
