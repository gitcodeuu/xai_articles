  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 27 (APP):Adviser to Prime Minister on Accountability Shahzad Akbar on Monday refuted reports of ‘acquittal’ of PML-N President Shahbaz Sharif and his son Suleman Shahbaz in a money laundering case from a London court.\nIn a series of messages from his Twitter handle, Shahzad Akbar said the reports about the alleged ‘acquittal’ of Shahbaz Sharif or his son Suleman Shahbaz are incorrect and misreporting.\n“The investigation by the NCA against Suleiman Shahbaz and some of his family members was not initiated at the request of [Asset Recovery Unit] ARU or NAB,” he said saying that it was a result of a suspicious transaction reported by a bank to NCA.\nHe said that certain funds were transferred by Suleman Shahbaz from Pakistan to UK in 2019 which were declared as a suspicious transaction by the UK authorities and the NCA secured an asset freezing order (AFO) from the court against these funds.\nHowever, he said that recently NCA decided to stop investigating these funds and therefore agreed to release these funds through court.\nShahzad Akber further clarified that such a release order is not an acknowledgment that funds are from a legitimate source.\n“There is no acquittal of any sort as reported as there was no trial! funds were frozen by NCA and NCA has decided to not investigate these funds anymore,” he said adding that Suleman [Shahbaz] remains a fugitive in a money laundering case against him and his father before the accountability court in Lahore.",
