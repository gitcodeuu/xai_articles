Over the past 67 years, there had been revolutionary changes to recording voices and music to provide optimal clarity and tonal accuracy while using digital technology.\nReviewing the distinctive quality of brass bands in the Pakistan Army, Air Force and Navy, it was also decided to make all efforts to utilize and further enhance the locally available instrumental capability of musicians while exploring the options for using the orchestras of friendly overseas countries, which have standing national orchestras to record only the instrumental version.\nThe vocal version would be rendered entirely by Pakistani vocalists. Despite possessing enormous talent in music, Pakistan neither has a permanent national orchestra unlike many other countries including Muslim countries like Turkey nor it possesses locally located most advanced sound recording facilities.\nExpressions of interest have already been invited from film and video producers of Pakistan to provide proposals for the creation of the new video of a duration of one minute 20 seconds by featuring the new re-recorded sound version.\nThe Steering Committee underlined the need to complete its task well in time to celebrate next anniversary of the Independence of Pakistan. Aspects of preparatory and production logistics along with their respective costs were also discussed in detail.\nThe Steering Committee was notified by the Federal government in June 2021 and later expanded to ensure maximum representation.",
