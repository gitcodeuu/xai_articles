Junagadh’s Instrument of accession with the state of Pakistan had an absolute validity under the auspices of international law.\nSpeakers appreciated the Pakistan’s government releasing of the new political map which has secured special importance in the eye of international law, terming the country’s support for the cause of Junagadh as crucial.\nThe speakers said Pakistan honored all international treaties in letter and spirit and considered that honoring a treaty was part of honoring international law and the norms of the international community. “India is not a country but a region and all the nations of this region have the right to independence”, they observed.\nSpeakers highlighted need to conduct more academic work on Junagadh issue and gave special leverage to the Junagadh community.\nThey pledged that supporting Junagadh was part of our national duty and acknowledged the courage and absolute resolve presented by the Nawab and Dewan of Junagadh state in carrying forward the case of Junagadh.\nSpeaking as a chief guest on the occasion, Former Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee of Pakistan, Gen. (retd) Ehsan Ul Haq said Junagadh was also an unfinished agenda of Pak-India partition like Indian Illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIoJK) which has to come to the logical conclusion some day.\n“Every aspect of Junagadh state has a strong legal foundation and reinforce the cause of IIoJK also”, he added.\nHe said nations which did not display resolve and determination to safeguard their legal and legitimate rights could never be secured and respected and even their survival remains in jeopardy.\n“We have to tell the world that we are a determined nation that will neverabandon its legal, just, and rightful claims”.\n“This is the era of `narratology’ since influx of social media platforms and if you can build a strong narrative to highlight such cause at international forums through mobilizing the researchers, intellectuals and youth of the country, you will be able to succeed”, he said.\nIn his presidential remarks, Nawab of Junagadh State, Nawab Muhammad Jahangir Khanji, thanked the Prime Minister, Imran Khan and his government for reiterating its stance through sharing Junagadh as part of Pakistan through the political map.\nHe said it was heartening to know that Pakistan has not forgotten the Junagadh state and the way its media, scholars and the state was reinvigorating their struggle for meaningful resolution of Junagadh issue clearly proved, “Junagadh is Pakistan”.\nDewan of Junagadh State and Chairman Muslim Institute, Sahibzada Sultan Ahmed Ali, Former Principal, Center for International Peace and Society, NUST, Maj Gen (Retd) Shahid Ahmad Hashmat, International law expert, Ahmer Bilal Soofi, Former Additional Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, Mr. Afrasiab Mehdi Hashmi Qureshi, Scholar from Department of History IIUI, Dr. Mujeeb Ahmad were among the speakers.",
