He lost his health but he fought for the right of Kashmiris to self-determination,” she said.\nThe minister said, “If the Indian govt thinks that forcing his family to bury him at night will prevent Kashmiris from mourning their icon properly, they are mistaken”.\nShe said such cowardice and such fear of the righteous was clearly running through the fascist Modi govt.",
