  "content": "President Dr Arif Alvi Thursday urged the business community to develop “Brand Pakistan” to tap the export potential of Pakistan and put the country on a new path of progress and prosperity.\nHe was speaking here at the awards ceremony of Pakistan Readymade Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association (PRGMEA).\nHe said that measures were required to manufacture value added products and raise the production of cotton and other agricultural commodities.\nThe President underlined the need for more steps to increase inclusion of women in the economic activities.\nWithout the inclusion of women in the economic sphere, the country’s progress would remain incomplete, he remarked.\nHe said now Pakistan should embark on the next phase of export oriented growth and the exporters should take advantage of the incentives offered by the government.\nThe government had taken Pakistan out of a difficult economic situation caused by a huge current account deficit accrued by the past governments, he added.\nHe said Pakistan would benefit the most from peace and stability in Afghanistan. Peace in Afghanistan would be bonanza for Pakistani manufacturers and exporters.\nHe observed that expertise of Pakistani businessmen and professionals would be needed for reconstruction and development activities in Afghanistan.\nThe President noted that India had bad relations with all its neighbours including Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Nepal, Sri Lanka and others.\nIndia had created difficulties for itself by alienating 15 percent Muslim population, he said adding Muslim community was being mistreated and harassed in India.\nDr Alvi said Pakistan learned important lessons in the war against terrorism and extremism. A two decade war was waged in Afghanistan, $ two trillion were spent and so many lives were lost but at the end the parties to the conflict had to come to the negotiating table.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan stated from day one that there was no military solution to the Afghan issue and he was right all along, he added.\nHe assured that the government was formulating all its economic policies in consultation with the stakeholders.\nThe obligation of the government was to create a suitable and conducive environment for the business community, industrialists and exporters, he continued.\nThe President said the government through consultations resolved issues of the industrialists and exporters and gave impetus to financial and economic progress.\nHe advised the Pakistani traders to make honesty and sincerity their guiding light to gradually develop the brand Pakistan.\nHe noted with satisfaction that the apparel exports of the country increased by 14 percent last year.\nHe explained steps that the government had taken to attract foreign direct investment.\nHe said the present government had put Pakistan in the right direction by strictly observing the moral values and stopping the loot and corruption of the past governments.\nThe President congratulated the winners of the awards and called upon them to contribute further to the economic activities of the country. The awards were given to leading exporters of the readymade garments and apparel.\nChairman PRGMEA Adeeb Iqbal in his speech highlighted the achievements of his organization in the manufacturing and export sectors.",
