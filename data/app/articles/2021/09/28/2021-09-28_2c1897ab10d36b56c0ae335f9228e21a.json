He said the business sector could support the women to prepare loan feasibility to put them on the track of financial independence.\nSimilarly, he said the differently abled persons could also be brought into mainstream by providing them jobs and skill training which would ensure their financial protection.\nArif Alvi, who earlier distributed awards among the nominees, said he as well as First Lady Samina Alvi had been striving for the rights of the differently abled persons as it was the social responsibility to provide them opportunities through their skill development.\nThe president lauded the contribution of the businessmen as well as other segments in Gujranwala in philanthropy services and for the national economic development.\nHe said Pakistan had a unique position vis-à-vis per capita charity as the philanthropists also lent a helping hand to the government for uplift of the poor people.\nHe recalled that the countries had achieved economic stability having learnt from Pakistan’s economic policies.\nHe told the gathering that there had been a tendency of misuse of tax money and urged the people to be extra cautious to safeguard their interest.\nHighlighting the strengths of Pakistan, he mentioned the hosting of millions of refugees, utmost discipline and pro-poor services during COVID pandemic. This is a strong Pakistan and Gujranwala is like a pillar having produced many philanthropists, he added.\nThe president said the country’s macroeconomic indicators as well as debt situation were moving on positive trajectory; however, he called for enhancing country’s exports.\nHe also advised the businessmen to put more focus on value addition and invest more on information technology along with the traditional industry.\nPresident of Gujranwala Chamber of Commerce and Industry Umar Ashraf Mughal said Gujranwala had been contributing to the country’s exports and economic development.
