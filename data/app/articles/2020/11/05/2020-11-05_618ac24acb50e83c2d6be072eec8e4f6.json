He said the economy was now making progress and dollar prices had fallen to Rs 159.\nHe said that PM Imran Khan’s announcement of power supply to industrial sector on subsidized rate would help increase exports.\nShehryar Afridi said that the entire world was now acclaiming the successful model of controlling the coronavirus pandemic in Pakistan.\nHe said that due to Billion Tree Tsunami campaign, Pakistan had already achieved all targets of green development.\nShehryar Khan Afridi said that due to effective efforts of the PTI government, the Kashmir issue had been highlighted in the world and India today stood isolated.\nEarlier, addressing a session on “Seerat-un-Nabi (PBUH) Week”, he urged the students to follow the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) who has set the best principles for life.\nHe said that the United Nations has set 17-Point Agenda of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) for today’s global human while the Holy Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH) had implemented these SDGs hundreds of years ago.\n“This reflects that Islam has introduced golden principles for the humans,” he added.",
