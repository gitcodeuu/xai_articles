The monthly installment would be Rs 6,600 on the loan worth Rs1 million for the first five years while the monthly installment\nwould be Rs13,199 on the loan worth Rs2 million, Rs19,799 on loan worth Rs3 million, Rs31,012 on loan worth Rs4 million and Rs38,765 installment on the loan worth Rs5 million.\nThere are three categories under the scheme, the first one is for Naya Pakistan Housing and Development Authority\n(NAHDA) projects, which includes five marla houses or apartments covering an area of 850 square feet.\nIn the second one, Non-NAPDHA projects include a five marla house or apartment in 850 square feet covered area.\nSimilarly, in the third one, non-NAPDHA projects consist of houses on more than 125 square yards up to 10 marla with\na covered area of 850 square feet to 1100 square feet.\nThe maximum value of first and second categories’ houses or apartments have been fixed at Rs3.5 million while the\nprice of third category houses or apartments have been fixed at Rs6 million.\nUnder this scheme, the loan of up to Rs2.7 million would be provided for the first category, maximum Rs3 million for\nthe second category and up to Rs5 million for the third category.\nThe government has allocated Rs378 billion to the banks for this purpose.\nThe processing of no objection certificate for approval of the projects in a short span of time is being completed by\nthe respective provincial development authorities through one window portal.\nThe federal cabinet has also passed an ordinance to provide tax incentives to the construction industry through\namendments in the Income Tax Ordinance 2001 and the Finance Act 1989.\nThe government is also providing the other facilities including fixed tax system and the provision of low-interest\nloans for the low-income groups and employees in the construction sector.",
