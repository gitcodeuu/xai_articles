The question should be asked from those who were supporting farmers that why did not they increase support price of crops in their tenures, she said and added that it was PTI’s government which increased the support price of wheat and paid Rs 175 billion to the sugarcane growers.\nShe said that a policy of setting up of journalists’ colonies throughout the province was being introduced for solving the residential problems of homeless journalists.\nDr. Firdous Ashiq Awan said that DGPR would be set on modern lines.
