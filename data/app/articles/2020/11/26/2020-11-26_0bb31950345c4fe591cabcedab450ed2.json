The NCOC has recommended a ban on public gatherings on Nov 11 and later Prime Minister Imran Khan announced a bar on holding of any such gatherings on Nov 25. The Islamabad High Court too had ruled against any such public rallies, owing to the recent spike in cases of coronavirus.\n40 deaths were reported on Wednesday, a bit lower than the figure of 59 of a day earlier, however the number of fresh cases has continued to rise with the latest tally touching 3,306 in a day.",
