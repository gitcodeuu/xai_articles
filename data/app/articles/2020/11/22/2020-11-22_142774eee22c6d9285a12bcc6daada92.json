The government was not intimidated by opposition’s rallies and the government was very much established and will remain so.\nChaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said that due to the rapid spread of coronavirus, we were asking the opposition to give up the politics of rallies but if they think that they will overthrow the government through rallies then this was their dream that will never be fulfilled.\nIn view of the coronavirus pandemic, he said it was in the interest of the nation that the opposition should refrain from engaging in protest politics. He said that due to the successful economic policies of the government, Pakistan is moving in the right direction and the future of Pakistan is in safe hands.\nThe government is taking all possible steps to address issues including inflation, he said.\nHe said, “I am sure that the government under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan will rid the country of inflation as well as strengthen the country economically.”",
