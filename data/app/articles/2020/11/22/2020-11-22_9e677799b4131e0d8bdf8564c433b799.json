She said that the remembrance of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is a way to get the blessings of Allah Almighty and a source of forgiveness and salvation for all of us in this world and the world hereafter.\nShe said that different activities were organised by the provincial government including Mehil-e-Milad, Naat and Qirat competition, Naatia Musharia, Ulema Mushaikh conference, calligraphy exhibition, quiz and debate competitions, Mehfil-e-Samaa, etc. in connection with Shan-e-Rehmatul-lil Alameen week across the province.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan and Punjab Chief Minister Usman Buzdar truly deserve credit for all this, she added.\nShe said that Prime Minister Imran Khan is following the golden principles set forth by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and committed to establishing a state on the pattern of the state of Madina. While representing the Muslim Ummah, the PM took a strong stand at the United Nations on the publication of blasphemous sketches in the West.\nShe said that the United Nations must decide code of conduct on the publication of blasphemous sketches in France and punishments should be proposed for those who use derogatory remarks and do any such offence against any of the prophets.\nShe praised all provincial government departments for actively participating in the Shan-e-Rehmatul-lil-Alameen week celebrations. Thanks to the media for cooperating and supporting the Shan-e-Rehmatul-lil-Alameen week, she added.\nLater, she gave away commendatory certificates and cash prizes to the position-holders of Naat, debates and quiz competitions in a ceremony held at Government Girls Degree College Daska and also participated in Mehfil-e-Samaa at Sialkot.",
