The minister appealed the Opposition benches to adopt pragmatic approach and desist from arranging public gatherings for safety and security of the masses.\nIn reply to a question about negotiations with Opposition, he said Shahid Khaqan Abbassi and other leaders of Pakistan Muslim League-N, wanted to close national accountability bureau (NAB), to get rid of the corruption cases.\nHe made it clear that incumbent government working under dynamic vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan would never grant national reconciliation ordinance (NRO), to PDM.",
