Commenting on unofficial election results being displayed on channels, he said the people are well aware of the negative role and performance of Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League-N.\nThe people would not cast vote for PML-N candidates who miserably failed in producing results for G-B areas.\nThe minister hoped that Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI), would form the government in G-B, with help of coalition partners including Majlis Wahadat-e-Muslimeen and independent candidates.",
