Opposition would suffer a defeat in Gilgit Baltistan (GB), he added.\nGB is set to elect its assembly members on November 15. President Pakistan Muslim League (N) Maryam Nawaz, Chairperson Pakistan Peoples Party, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and other political figures have been campaigning in the region for the last few days.\nThis will be the region’s third election since it was given the power to rule itself in 2009.

Of the remaining seats, six are reserved for women and three for technocrats.",
