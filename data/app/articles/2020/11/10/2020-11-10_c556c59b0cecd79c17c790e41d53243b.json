There would be a regular check on crop burning, transport and industrial emissions, brick kilns and cross border emissions which are the main reasons.\nThe SAPM said much-needed technology has been provided to farmers to help them avoid burning of paddy crop residue and instead convert the residue into organic fertilizer for boosting fertility of their farmlands.\nHe said technology was also being introduced across the country under government’s project for Mechanized Management of Rice Crop Residue for which Rs. 30 billion were being spent for disbursement of 50,000 units of rice straw shredder.\nAnother initiative is provision of Happy Seeder technology to help farmers stem the stubble burning which is one of the reason of smog in Winter.",
