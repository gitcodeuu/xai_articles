Development works at Jehangir Tomb, Hiran Minar and other archaeological sites were also being done on priority.\nTo make the country hub of tourism, he added that religious tourism was also being promoted by the government under the leadership of PM Imran Khan and many sites of religious minorities were being upgraded and road infrastructure was being developed to ensure access to the sites.",
