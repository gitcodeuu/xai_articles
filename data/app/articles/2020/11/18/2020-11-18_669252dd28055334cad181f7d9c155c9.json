A picture was posted on the home page with some profanities.\nThe website was back on line after a brief interval and the hackers could only make some changes on the News and Events section on the homepage. However the site was restored by midday.\nSimilarly the target of Indian hackers also targeted www.roshanpakistan.pk, taskforce.piac.com.pk, sims.piac.com.pk where they left the message that changing status of Gilgit Baltistan was a “suicidal attempt” and would have “consequences”.\nPakistani cybersecurity officials have rubbished such attempts saying all key government websites were fully secure and undergo regular reviews to keep their systems secure.\nThe NTISB in a recent advisory, available online, warned of malware spreading through spoofed emails targeting security institutions.\nThe Inter Services Public Relations on Aug 12 said Pakistan’s Intelligence Agencies have identified a major cyber-attack by Indian Intelligence Agencies involving a range of cyber crimes including deceitful fabrication by hacking personal mobiles and technical gadgets of government officials and military personnel.\nHowever the need for remaining on the guard and keeping an updated hardware and software security systems in place to ward of any threats was vital.",
