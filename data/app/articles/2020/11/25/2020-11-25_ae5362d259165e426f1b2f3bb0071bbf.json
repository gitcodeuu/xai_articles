On the occasion, the speakers, including female parliamentarians, called for collective efforts to prevent and address the issues of gender-based violence.\nStudents also performed a role play underlining the risks of gender-based violence in the COVID-19 pandemic. Female Afghan refugees also narrated their stories and shed light on how they pursued their ambitions amid challenges.\nIn Quetta, a seminar was held on Wednesday in Pishin City on the theme of “Ending violence against women”. The speakers included religious scholars and other notable community members.\nTo mark the last day of the 16 Days of Activism on 10 December – Human Rights Day – UNHCR will also hold an event in Quetta with refugees and Pakistani host community members.
