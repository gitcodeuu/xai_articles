Pakistan, he said could bot be undermined due to its significant geographical status at South, Central and Western Asia as it emerged a potential partner in Afghan peace process recently.\nThe first panel session was moderated by CASS Director Air Marshal (R) Waseem ud din.\nFormer Foreign Minister Ambassador (R) Inam ul Haq while deliberating on Regional Security Dynamics said the world was passing through the stage of turmoil as it was the age of impunity, disillusionment, disruption and fragmentation.\nHaq added that neo-fascism, xenophobia and Islamophobia were prevailing in the world with authoritarian majority ruling leaders governing most of the regional states.\nHe regretted that there was no criticism made on India for its human rights violations in Kashmir and brutalities unleashed on minorities in its state.\n“Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s policy and Rashtrya Sawayamsevak Sangh (RSS) relentless anti-Pakistan campaigns are a serious threat to peace in South Asia.”\nAmbassador (R) Jalil Abbas Jilani highlighted Pakistan’s challenges and opportunities in Emerging World Order.\nHe said owing to the compulsions of new world order Pakistan had consolidated its relationships with China and moved forward to explore new venues of cooperation with China.\nIn the future, there were hard choices to be made by Pakistan as US-Iran and Saudi Arabia tension was a major challenge for Pakistan. Moreover, Pakistan could maintain its neutral role between the choice to be placed to align with the US or China.\nPakistan, he said should develop a considered policy for gulf countries and continue its efforts for Afghan peace process despite all impediments.\nThe second panel discussion was moderated by South Asian Strategic Stability Institute (SASSI) University Director General Dr Maria Sultan where Air Marshal (R) Sir Brian Burridge Chief Executive Officer Royal Aeronautical Society of the UK, Group Captain Lyle Holt from Royal Australian Air Force and others discussed the emergent technology debate and presented their views on diverse aspects related to the topic.",
