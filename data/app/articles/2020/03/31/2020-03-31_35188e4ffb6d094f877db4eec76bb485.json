  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 31 (APP):The Federal Cabinet on Tuesday decided to immediately restore food and goods transport in the country for ensuring uninterrupted food supply chain to save the poor segments of the society from hunger and unemployment.\nSpecial Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan told the media that Prime Minister Imran and the whole cabinet expressed their displeasure over delay in the implementation of the National Coordination Committee’s (NCC) decision taken in its last meeting of restoring the goods transport so that the supply chain of the daily use items was not affected .\nThe Sindh government, she said, had not so far fully implemented the NCC decision as all import items from abroad landed at ports in Karachi, where sufficient labour force was not available due to the lock-down to handle them.\nThe prime minister issued directives to the Rangers to remove hurdles in the movement of goods transport as early as possible to restore the supply chain of eatable items, she added.\nThe SAPM said the cabinet also expressed its dismay over indulgence of\nLeader of the Opposition in National Assembly Shehbaz Sharif in political point scoring at the critical juncture. The NCC took decisions in consensus with all the stakeholders as it had representation of all the provinces, including Azad Jammu & Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and all the political parties.\nShe urged the opposition to avoid politicizing the current situation and join hands\nwith government in its endeavour to contain the coronavirus.\nThe opposition leader was trying to use the coronavirus pandemic to keep him politically in but the country and the nation could not afford such a divisive approach which could harm the fight against the coronavirus, she added.\nShehbaz Sharif, she said, should better end his self-isolation at Jati Umra and join the fight against the coronavirus and give practical proposals as it was not time to indulge in petty politics.\nShe said it was an irony that Shahbaz Sharif was criticizing the health sector despite the fact that he remained in power for ten years in the biggest province of the country. The Sharif family should donate some of their assets to the fund set up by the government to support the people affected by the ongoing lockdown in the country, she added.\nDr Firdous said the prime minister briefed the cabinet on the two-pronged strategy of saving the people from the spread of coronavirus and at the same time saving the country’s economy from its negative impacts, besides taking steps to revive construction and other industries, which provided employment to the poor labour class.\nShe said at the outset, the cabinet reviewed the implementation of the decisions taken by the NCC in its last meeting and their practical impacts.\nShe said Special Assistant to the PM on Health Dr Zafar Mirza and Dr Faisal Sultan, PM’s Focal Person on the Coronavirus, briefed the meeting about the latest situation and the steps being taken to control deadly virus. It was informed that so far 1,865 persons had tested positive for the coronavirus, out of them 58 had fully recovered and discharged from hospitals. About 25 persons had unfortunately died whereas the condition of 12 was critical and they were on ventilator.\nThe prime minister stated policies were being updated in line with the situation, which was being monitored on daily basis, she added.\nThe SAPM said the cabinet gave formal approval to Rs 1,200 billion financial stimulus package to deal with the adverse impacts of the coronavirus outbreak on the country’s economy.\nThe prime minister renewed his firm commitment that the government would take all possible steps to protect the general public from the coronavirus and also at the same time save them from poverty, hunger and unemployment in face of the ongoing lock-down in the country.\nDr Firdous said the prime minister also expressed his displeasure over the treatment meted out to the coronavirus patients as untouchables by the law enforcement agencies personnel and the security staff at hospitals and asked the governments concerned to ensure that they were treated respectfully.\nThe SAPM said the cabinet also gave approval for the launch of domestic Sukuk bonds for next three years.\nShe said the Labour Ministry was directed to prepare a strategy in consultation with all the provinces for registration of the labour class to ensure their social, health and job security.\nThe prime minister asked the SAPM on Overseas Pakistanis and Manpower Zulfiqar Bukhari to make sure that the issue was taken up at the Council of Common Interests so that the labourers could get social security benefits and job security, she added.\nSpecial Assistant on Poverty Alleviation Dr Sania Nishtar briefed the cabinet about the mechanism for cash transfer of Rs150 billion to 12 million poor families across the country under the Ehsaas Programme.\nThe cabinet also called for expediting the reforms process in Pakistan Railways, Pakistan International Airlines , Federal Bureau of Revenue and other corporations.\nIt also issued directives for shift to e-governance and paperless governance and asked the ministries and departments to upload their information on their websites to save the money wasted on purchase of papers.\nDr Firdous the cabinet gave approval to 15 international protocol conventions in the meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
