  "content": "MULTAN, Mar 31 (APP)::Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi Tuesday urged the international community, particularly the G-20 countries, to restructure the debts of third world countries to help them fight the coronavirus pandemic.\nTalking to the media after visiting a quarantine centre in Multan, he first advised the media persons, who were there to cover his press conference, to maintain distance from one another.\nThe people must strictly follow the guidelines given by the government regarding social distancing and adopting a hygienic lifestyle to save themselves, their family members and those living in heir surrounding localities from the virus, stressed.\nThe government, he added, could not overcome the challenge alone and needed the full cooperation of the people.\nQureshi said the third world countries, having limited resources and fragile health care systems, needed support. The resources being spent on debt servicing and payment of interest could be utilized by them on saving lives and improving their health care systems, he added.\nHe said the United Nations Secretary General had endorsed Pakistan’s point of view in that regard.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-19), he said, was a challenge the world had witnessed never before. No continent had escaped from the virus as 199 countries were combating the challenge, he added.\nQureshi thanked China for extending help to Pakistan on priority. There was enormous demand from all over the world for ventilators, and other medical equipment, but the Chinese government was ensuring supplies to Pakistan in the difficult time. Pakistan had already received five aeroplanes loaded with medical supplies from China, while more would land here soon, he added.\nHe said during his recent visit to China along with President Dr Arif Alvi, the Chinese president and prime minister had promised full cooperation. A Pakistani team had left for China for more medical supplies, he added.\nHe said in addition to the medical supplies, China had also sent a team of doctors and paramedics to help Pakistan fight the pandemic.\nQureshi said on instructions of Prime Minister Imran Khan, he had also contacted foreign ministers of different countries to express solidarity with them, to share steps taken by Pakistan to combat the coronavirus challenge and to know how they were moving forward so that the good practices they had adopted could be replicated in Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
