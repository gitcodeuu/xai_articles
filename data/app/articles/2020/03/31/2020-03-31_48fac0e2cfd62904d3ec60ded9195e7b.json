He added with this we would have better capacity and would be able to conduct test of all eligible people in the country.\nHe said that it was very unfortunate that in some areas corona positive patients were being treated as criminals by police and administration. He added this was against the morality to deal in such way with the affected person and they would avoid reporting to have coronavirus.\nHe said that this would cause further spread of disease and harm the efforts of all those who were struggling for its control from the country.\nHe asked to stop this inappropriate behavior with them and follow suitable policy.\nDr Mirza said “They need support rather adopting any harsh attitude along with arrest and threat.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
