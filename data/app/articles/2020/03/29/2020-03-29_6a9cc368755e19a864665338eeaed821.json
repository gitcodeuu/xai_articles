In addition, they should also ensure their access to free medical care in this testing time.\nShe also demanded that health workers and doctors who were in the frontline while fighting in this emergency should also be accommodated.\nShe added that with schools, offices, shops and business completely shutdown, the option of working from home was a privilege available only to white-collar knowledge workers .\nEven, she added that if save from illness, low -income groups would still contend with acute food insecurity in this mounting crisis.\nAzhar said lack of adequate social safety nets, such as paid leave and medical benefits was increasing the vulnerability of everyday bread winners in this crisis.",
