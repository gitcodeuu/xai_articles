Also, families within their homes can arrange group prayers.\nThe edict says it is obligatory for Muslims to abide by the health instructions of the state in case of crisis and avoid following unofficial information and rumors.\nAs per credible medical reports, the coronavirus spreads very easily and quickly. In this situation, saving human lives and protecting them from all risks and threats is in line with the great concept of Islam, the Fatwa said.\n“In view of risks to the lives of people, the officials in Muslim countries have full authority to cancel Friday prayers and other congregational prayers.\n“Furthermore, the older people should remain at their homes and follow the stated medical guidelines as all evidences clearly show that public gatherings, including prayers, constitute a conducive environment for virus, it said.\nThe Fatwa cites Abu Dawood narrating Ibn Abbas,who recounted that Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) said that fear of sickness is an excuse for missing Juma payers. Moreover, Abd Al-Rahman Ibn Auf stated that the Prophet (PBUH) forbade those with unpleasant smell to avoid going to mosques in order to protect other faithful from disturbance.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
