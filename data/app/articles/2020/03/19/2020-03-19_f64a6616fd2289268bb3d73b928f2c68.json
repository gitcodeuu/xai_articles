The Washington Post and Politico reported that the White House had asked Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Cisco and Twitter for help.\nThe World Health Organization’s director-general has also termed disinformation as dangerous as COVID-19. “We’re not just fighting an epidemic; we’re fighting an infodemic. Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous,” WHO official Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during an address at the Munich Security conference on Feb. 15, almost a month before the WHO officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic.",
