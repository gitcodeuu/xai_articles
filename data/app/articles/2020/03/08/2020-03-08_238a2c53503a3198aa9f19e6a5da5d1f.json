The Ulema’s role in this regard was critical for creation of mass awareness, he observed.\nThe ceremony was attended by PM’s Special Assistant on Health Dr Zafar Mirza, PM’s Special Assistant on Social Protection and Poverty Alleviation Dr. Sania Nishtar, Federal Ombudsman Kashmala Tariq, Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqi, prominent women personalities and representatives of different organizations.\nThe president also referred to the government’s flagship of social security and welfare ‘Ehsas’ programme and said the government was committed to ensure social and economic betterment of womenfolk.\nQuoting a saying of founding father Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah about the significance of women’s role in society, he said womenfolk should be provided with violence and harassment free environment.\nThe president noted that the government could not alone work over these issues, it could enact laws, but it was the collective cause and responsibility of all stakeholders to play their parts.\nHe also opined that dropout rate of the female students from the schools was linked to certain social and economic conditions.\nWhereas in the secondary and intermediate levels, girl students were outshining the male students, but at the higher education level, their participation gradually diminished which indicated certain issues which should be addressed promptly, he added.\nThe president also stressed upon creation of spaces for mothers at their workplaces to properly look after their nascent babies.\nThe womenfolk in the country were confronted with serious health issues of malnutrition and stress, leading to child stunting and thus impacting the overall health of a family and ultimately society.\nThe developed countries always carved ways to overcome their conflicts and controversies in their societies, he said noting that in the national building, it was necessary to resolve all the issues peacefully.\nHe also lauded working of the FOSPAH which was established some ten years back, observing that 12 per cent increase was witnessed in filing of complaints, still there was need to encourage the victim women to register their grievances.\nThe president informed that he had directed the Ombudsman office to entertain complaints over women’s inheritance rights.\nHe said a proposal was also under consideration over giving of property as gift by the women members of a family to ensure their ownership rights.\nDuring the ceremony, documentaries showing contributions of notable women personalities in different fields and the performance of the FOSPAH were also screened.\nPM’s Special Assistant on Health Dr Zafar Mirza, addressing the ceremony, paid tributes to all women of the country who had inspired the society and the world while working against all odds and upholding their rights.\nHe observed that the high mortality rate in the country was alarming which was hundred percent preventable. There were nine million reported pregnancies across the country and out of these, four million females did not want them due to population growth and other social issues.\nMoreover, fifty per cent mothers had been anemic to give birth to children, he added.\nHe said forty per cent children in the country had been facing stunted growth which if not treated at early stages could create life-long complications.\nPM’s Special Assistant on Social Protection and Poverty Alleviation Dr. Sania Nishtar said functioning of the FOSPAH should be emulated in the private sector to ensure harassment free environment for the working women.\nAbout Ehsaas programme, she said, the government was committed to women’s welfare and economic security. She said under the law on women’s inheritance rights, for the first time in the country’s history women had been given the ownership rights.\nDilating upon details of government’s different programmes, she said the Kafalat programme, had an inclusion of 100 per cent women, women share in the income programme stood around 60 per cent whereas under PM’s scholarships programme, 51 per cent quota was allocated for the female students, besides fifty per cent women inclusion was ensured in the loan facility.\nDr Nishtar said it was the men’s attitude which determined how the women would prosper in the society.\nFederal Ombudsman Kashmala Tariq giving an overview of the FOSPAH said it was ensuring harassment free workplaces to the women in the last ten years.\nShe said the women had been agents of change as they had been playing active role from managing their household to earning their livelihood with dignity.\nShe stressed upon the need to remove certain complex issues related to attitude and behaviours in the society and urged the media to play its wider role in creation of awareness among the masses.\nShe said there had been phenomenal increase in the number of women working in different sectors of the country.\nKashmala Tariq said the women should not be excluded rather they should be included by encouraging them to take part in different areas of life. It was not a dispute between the men and women but by putting together their joint efforts for a prosperous society, she added.",
