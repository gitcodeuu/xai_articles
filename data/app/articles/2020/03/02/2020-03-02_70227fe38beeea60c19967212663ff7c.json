This was a distinction between a society based upon a humane society and the other one built upon ‘the survival of the fittest’.\n“My government has resolved to make them our priority,” he added.\nHe also regretted that in the country, elite class took advantage of all the facilities including education while for the poor, there was a different schooling system with numerous hurdles.\nThe prime minister said that Pakistan’s biggest asset was its youth, stressing upon them to take full benefits of the scholarship programme.\nHe also referred to establishment of NAML University at Mianwali which is affiliated with University of Bradford UK, and said around 75 per cent of the students enrolled there came from the Urdu medium schools.\nBut despite all of this, about 50 to 55 per cent of the students secured first divisions from the University of Bradford.\n“All this proves that these students (from poor families) have an urge and drive to progress in life,” he added.\nAbout other social security and protection initiatives by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government, the prime minister said that through distribution of health cards, the underprivileged segments were getting health treatment facilities.\nIn Punjab, so far health cards had been distributed among six million families whereas, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government had decided to extend this facility to all the deserving families.\nBesides, through Ehsaas income programme, they were providing the womenfolk in the villages with animals and poultry to bolster their income besides, increasing the protein intakes affecting a major chunk of population in these areas.\nAbout, 1,70,000 youths were being imparted skills development training, he added.\nAbout 170 panahgahs (shelter homes) had been set up, providing decent facilities to the homeless people, he said, adding that their numbers would be enhanced.\nMeanwhile, the government was also planning to provide legal aid to the poor people with the government assistance.\nHe declared that all these initiatives were based upon merit with no political influence involved which was the reason for their success.\nAccording to details, the four-year, Rs 24 billion initiative will support 200,000 students (50% girls) from low-income backgrounds. As part of the Ehsaas scholarships policy, 2% scholarships will be exclusively awarded to students with special needs.\nOverall, 50,000 scholarships will be given every year to enhance financial access to higher education for the deserving.\nThe continuation of scholarship in following years will depend upon the maintenance of academic performance.\nThe need and merit-based scholarship covers tuition fee as well as a living stipend. The prime objective of Ehsaas scholarships program is to ensure that no eligible student is deprived of higher education because of the financial issues.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Special Assistant on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Sania Nishtar said that the initiative was the biggest ever need based and students focused programme for the undergraduates.\nShe said that merit, transparency and honesty were the basic ingredients behind this initiative launched under the Ehsaas programme.\nDr Sania said there was a difference between a government which indulged in corruption, plundering the state resources and destroying its institutions largely affecting its downtrodden.\nShe enumerated that the mechanism and process for implementation of these initiatives was based upon strict adherence to transparency and merit, still she observed that they had to work for bringing more reforms in the institutions.\nShe said about 50 per cent quota in the scholarship programme was allocated for the female students whereas 2 per cent for the disabled.\nThe special assistant further informed that in the first phase, process for awarding scholarships for the year 2019-20 had been completed by the Higher Education Commission and the next phase would commence in the upcoming June.\nShe said a total of 200,000 students would benefit from this programme. A total of over 132,000 students had applied for the scholarships, she added.\nDuring the last 20 years, after establishment of HEC only 29,000 scholarships were awarded when compared to 50,000 scholarships being awarded in one year by this incumbent government, she added.\nDr Sania said the programme was a historic shift in the government’s scholarship policy as in the past, scholarships were given only to students pursuing higher studies.\nShe further explained that the scholarship programme covered the tuition fee whereas Rs 4,000 would be given to the students as a monthly stipend.\nMinister for Federal Education and Professional Training Shafqat Mahmood said that the programme, for the first time, had focused upon undergraduates who would be immensely benefitted.\nHe said apart from this programme, about 1,70,000 youths were getting high-end skill training including in the latest software technology.\nChairman Higher Education Commission (HEC) Tariq Banuri termed the initiative as a game changer for the deserving undergraduates and emphasized that students from the deprived areas should fully avail this opportunity.",
