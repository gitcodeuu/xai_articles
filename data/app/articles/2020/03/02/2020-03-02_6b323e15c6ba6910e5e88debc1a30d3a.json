Memon.\nAccording to the Foreign Office statement, the consultations centered on the entire spectrum of bilateral relations including political, economic, commercial, security, consular and people-to-people ties.\nBoth sides agreed that the BPC provided a useful mechanism for regular, in-depth exchange of views on all issues of common interest. To further deepen existing friendly ties, it was decided to enhance the momentum of bilateral exchanges and high level visits.\nThe UAE side was briefed on the on-going Indian atrocities in Indian Occupied Jammu & Kashmir following India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019.\nThe treatment of minorities, particularly persecution of Indian Muslims, was highlighted, emanating from the BJP’s extremist Hindutva’s ideology and policies of discrimination. Views were also exchanged on regional developments, including Afghan peace process and peace and stability in the Gulf/Middle East.\nAssistant Foreign Minister, Ambassador Khalifa Shaheen Khalifa Almarar, also paid a courtesy call on Foreign Secretary Sohail Mahmood.\nPakistan and UAE have long-standing fraternal ties, anchored on mutual goodwill and close cooperation. The BPC with UAE was another step to reinforce the growing bilateral cooperation in diverse fields.",
