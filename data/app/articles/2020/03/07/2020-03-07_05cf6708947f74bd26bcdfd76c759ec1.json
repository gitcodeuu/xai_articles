It is not listed in any international export control list. Contrary to what is being claimed, the item was correctly declared in the relevant documentation and there was no attempt to hide or conceal any information,” the spokesperson remarked.\nShe explained that the claims regarding the possible military dimension of the held item were factually incorrect as similar furnaces were being used in several industries in Pakistan and the world over.",
