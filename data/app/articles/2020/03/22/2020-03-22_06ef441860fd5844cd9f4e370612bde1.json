People are now receiving advisories and prevention at their homes instead of rushing to hospitals just because of these telemedicine centres,” he said and added that the persons requiring corona tests were also being helped out actively.\nThe governor mentioned that only 16 persons out of 10,500 had been advised to get corona tests in the first batch of corona telemedicine helpline centre at University of Health Sciences Lahore. He said, “I know, many people are the poor and facing livelihood earning problems but we will not leave them alone rather provide free monthly ration in collaboration with Punjab Development Network, to the poor persons, whose livelihood earnings/jobs are affected in the wake of coronvirus crisis.\nWe all have to make a pledge to fulfill our responsibilities at all costs in the war against coronavirus.”",
