There was a need to revitalise this key organization to tackle common challenges, he added.\nIn the context of effective efforts to combat the pandemic, he noted that Pakistan had proposed that sanctions on Iran be lifted so that humanitarian relief could be provided at this time of crisis to save precious human lives.\nForeign Minister Qureshi further noted that Prime Minister Imran Khan had proposed that developed countries might facilitate developing countries to meet the challenge through debt restructuring so that they could use limited resources to mitigate the effects of the pandemic on their economies and provide effective relief to poor people.\nThe two ministers agreed to work closely to promote collaborative endeavours for regional benefit.",
