After a gap of 55 years, three debates had been held by the UN Security Council on Jammu and Kashmir, along with an emergency session of the OIC Contact Group on Jammu & Kashmir.\nShe said the OIC IPHRC (Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission) delivered a strong statement condemning Indian atrocities in the IOJ&K.\nThe Foreign Office Spokesperson said the Modi-led government in India was pursuing a fascist RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh) ideology and “Hindutva” agenda, and had been engaged in anti-Pakistan propaganda at world forums, including the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). However, owing to effective measures taken by the Government of Pakistan, the Indian lobby failed to get Pakistan’s name into the FATF’s black list.\nShe said Pakistan over the past one and a half years attained new vigour, energy and dynamism in its relations with various important countries.\nResponding to a question about the reasons behind the positive change in the stance by Gulf countries vis-a-vis Pakistan, she attributed it to the personality of Prime Minister Imran Khan, and said, “He has been known to the world for a long time and carries a certain charisma, which goes well with many a world leaders.”\nMs Farooqui said Pakistan had been striving for peace in Afghanistan over the last four decades, and wanted the resolution of issues through an Afghan-led and Afghan-owned peace process. The opening up of the country’s borders for four million Afghan refugees was in line with the Islamic traditions and values.\nShe expressed the hope that after the February 29 Doha Peace Agreement signed between the United States and the Taliban as well as the inauguration of Afghan President Ashraf Ghani, the intra-Afghan dialogue would lead to the goal of peace in Afghanistan.\nShe said it was satisfactory to note that Pakistan’s role of a facilitator in the Afghan peace process was acknowledged globally as it believed that “an inclusive peace and reconciliation involving all segments of the Afghan society is the only way forward.”\nThe spokesperson, when asked about the recent terrorist attacks in Afghanistan following the peace deal and claimed by the IS (Daesh), said all sides needed to be wary of the greatest challenge of “spoilers”, who were bent upon thwarting the peace process in that country. She was optimist for progress in prisoners swap between the Afghan government and the Taliban soon.\nShe said it was the responsibility of Afghan representatives to come to the table for intra-Afghan dialogue. Pakistan’s position had been acknowledged globally as a “bridge builder and peace maker” as it had made sincere efforts to maintain regional peace and stability.\nReferring to the focus on building economic and investment relations with the Gulf and Middle East countries, she mentioned some of the achievements, including US $ 20 billion investment in Pakistan by Saudi Arabia, long-term Strategic Economic Partnership with the United Arab Emirates (UAE), strengthening of Pakistan-Turkey –Malaysia trilateral engagement while boosting manpower export to Qatar by 100,000.\nAbout ‘Engage Africa’ vision, Ms Farooqui said it was aimed at further promoting Pakistan’s trade and economic relations with the African countries. Pakistan, despite good political and diplomatic ties with the African countries, had little trade and wanted to reap its due share from the annual US $ 5 trillion trade in the region.\nShe said the Pakistan Trade Conference in Nairobi in January, which was inaugurated by the Kenyan president, was a step forward in that direction. The conference, which was attended by over 100 Pakistan companies, was also addressed by Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi and Advisor on Commerce Abdul Razak Dawood, she added.\nMs Farooqui said to further strengthen Pakistan’s trade and economic relations with African countries the number of Pakistan missions in Africa was being raised from the current 15 to 21.\nReferring to the Pakistani students in Hubei province of China, she said they were being taken good care of by the Chinese government. The Foreign Office had deputed two of its officers, who personally met them and said they were in good health. She denied social media reports that a Pakistani PhD student had died because of novel coronavirus.\nShe said extensive arrangements had been made to facilitate the Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) from Iran at the Taftan border, where they were being quarantined to ensure safety and protection of all.\nTo a question about Pakistan’s foreign policy, she said its basic fundamentals were inspired from the Quaid-e-Azam’s guiding quotes of “peace within and without” as well as the principles of honesty, fair-play and international cooperation.\nPakistan’s foreign policy was driven by Article 40 of its Constitution, the vision of government and leadership and the voice of the parliament, the spokesperson added.",
