All are stable and there is no evidence of local spread as yet.”\nDr Mirza said “If we act responsibly we can avoid spread. The most important to limit the spread of coronavirus is to ensure that we observe hygiene by washing hands properly, avoid touching our face and keep distance with sick people.”\nHe said that the government is working hard to contain the spread, but we all need to take our part in his fight.",
