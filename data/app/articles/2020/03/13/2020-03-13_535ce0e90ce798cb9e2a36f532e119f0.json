She said that as now the matter was subjudice, it was not justified to hold “media courts” on the issue as it tantamount to an attempt to influence the judges of the court.\nShe said that both the parties should present their evidences in the court of law and media debate on the issue should be avoided.\nShe said that the government had come to know about the arrest of Mir Shakil from the media, and did not react as the matter related to NAB, which was an independent institution.\nHowever, she said now the government was compelled to clarify its position as the said media group was trying to malign the Prime Minister and defame the PTI government by claiming victimization on the part of the government .\nShe asked the concerned media house to also highlight the version of the government in this case.\nShe said that the people had voted Imran Khan to power for ensuring rule of law in the country as promised in PTI manifesto.\nTo a question, she said that the country was moving towards a national narrative on Coronavirus and efforts were being made to overcome this issue with the cooperation of the provincial government.\nShe said that this pandemic has become an international problem and it has health, economic and social and connectivity challenges.",
