The conspirators should justify the loot made in their tenure  and the politics of those, who made the country bankrupted, has ended  forever, he added.\nHe emphasised that conspirators would remain unsuccessful and the  propagandists would also face defeat. The government remained involved in  public-welfare during the last one and a half years. On the contrary, the past  rulers spent billions of rupees on their personal projections, he lamented.  The government will burn the midnight oil to fulfill the promises. The matter of southern Punjab secretariat would be resolved amicably, he added.\nJehangir Tareen said the most transparent government was constantly engaged in public service under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan. The opposition has no agenda, he said and added that opposition parties were scattered due to chaos.\nHe made it clear that in-house change would not occur nor there would be any mid-term elections. The hopes of dreamers would remain unfulfilled and PTI would also win the next elections, he added. He further said the progress made with regard to the establishment of southern Punjab secretariat was praiseworthy.",
