The decision of installing these devices was made after the government announced that it would be increasing health oversight in the airports keeping in view the reporting of coronavirus cases in neighbouring and other countries.\nThe scanners measure a person’s body temperature, and any individuals found suffering from fever was then approached by health authorities and a mouth swab test was administered on the person, which can determine whether the person was suffering from coronavirus or not.\nHe said in this way the screening process of suspected coronavirus patients had become more effective and useful.\nHe said this latest system would help the health staff to easily detect the coronavirus patients at entry points of airports.\nThe official said new sign boards and posters had been placed at airports informing passengers about being potentially tested. Earlier, there were complaints on performance of thermal devices and its limited functions.\nHe said the government would take all actions keeping the protection of people’s health supreme and guided by the science of public health. “We are working round the clock and maintaining high level of vigilance to counter the public health challenge posed by Novel Coronavirus pandemic.”\nHe said Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza personally visited the Islamabad International Airport and inspected the special health desk established for screening of passengers to prevent outbreak of coronavirus.\nHe added that Dr Mirza was regularly reviewing preparations to make passenger screening foolproof at airports while a full scale mock exercise was also being conducted by para medical staff at airports.\nThe official said the federal and provincial governments were committed to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\nHe said a strict vigilance was being maintained at the airports with screening of incoming travelers and their follow up by dedicated public health teams and airport health authorities.\nHe added that effective screening mechanism had been adopted at all Points of Entry (POE) to have check on coronavirus patients.\nHe said in line with WHO guidelines and in accordance with international best practices, both isolation facilities at designated hospitals and quarantine arrangements were essential requirements to meet any eventuality.",
