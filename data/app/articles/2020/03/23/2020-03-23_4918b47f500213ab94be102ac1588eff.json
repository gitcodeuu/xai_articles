I cannot go any further, but you O Messenger of peace and friend of the Master of the worlds, continue your glorious\nascent. The Holy Prophet (PBUH) continued his journey until he reached\nvery close to the Throne of God Almighty and attained the utmost nearness to Him.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
