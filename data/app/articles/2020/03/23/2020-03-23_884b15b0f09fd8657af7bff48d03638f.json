These teams comprising representatives of revenue department, NGOs and Expanding Immunization Program (EPI), are busy in tracing the people who had recently come from abroad, to get them tested and to shift the suspects to the quarantine centers.\nThe Director General Health told the AJK president that isolated wards have been established in ten hospitals of Azad Kashmir, while samples of 44 suspected coronacases of the state were to the National Institute of Health. Of them, test reports of 40 people have been received, and only one of them has been tested positive, who has been shifted to quarantine center in Mirpur.\nThe state president was informed that virology lab at Abbas Institute of Medical Sciences Muzaffarabad has been strengthened on emergency basis, and hopefully, this will start functioning in a couple of days. The rapid response teams, he said, has also been assigned the task to coordinate, take preventive and monitor the situation round the clock.\nAJK president said that emergency measures like screening of suspected people at the entry and exit points of the liberated territory, setting up of quarantine centers, ensuring presence and training of physicians and the concerned staff in hospitals as well as timely provision of medicines have already been taken. But this is a ongoing process which will continue on daily basis, he asserted.\nSardar Masood Khan appreciated the armed forces of Pakistan for imparting training to the medical teams deputed for the treatment of potential coronavirus cases. He also lauded National Disaster Management Authority, Azad Kashmir State Disaster Management Authority and other agencies concerned for taking emergency measures.\nHe said that it is a great challenge to mitigate the negative impacts of corona on the state economy particularly the vulnerable marginalized segments of the society. However, the volume and size of some economic package for the affected people can only be determined after the data is collected. He appealed to the people to strictly follow the guidelines being provided by the medical experts to save themselves and their families from the pandemic.\nWhile referring to the situation in occupied Kashmir, the AJK president lamented that now when the world has focused its attention on spread of coronavirus, India had started a new spate of repression in the held territory. The Indian troops have stepped up killing the Kashmiri people during so-called door to door searches in the length and cranny of occupied Kashmir.\nHe called upon the international community to take notice of India’s repressive actions and violations of human rights in occupied Kashmir.",
