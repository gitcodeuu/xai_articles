  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 24 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan Friday strongly condemned the statements of Indian Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat and Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Manoj Mukund Naravane.\nThe Indian CDS had claimed to detain Kashmiri children to their so-called\nde-radicalization camps where they were maimed and tortured through electrocution and beaten up with metal wires, he said while talking to media persons.\n“Indian occupied forces are apprehending youth and children in the occupied valley and sending them to concentration camps and North India’s jails where they are being subjected to unprecedented atrocities,” he added.\n“The Indian Army Chief announced that if Indian parliament allows then he will invade AJK. I will like to challenge India that AJK is prepared to thwart any of its misadventure with a strong response,” the AJK President said.\nThe Indian Occupied Kashmir (IOK) was under siege for the past 173 days where women and young girls were gang raped by the Indian occupied soldiers at late evening and night hours.\n“Neither children nor women are safe in the IOK as thousands of young boys are sent behind the bars but despite all odds and oppression women and men have stood up against the occupied Indian forces,” he added.\nIndian occupied forces had turned the entire valley into a jail and it (India) has divided the IOK into two parts on October 31, 2019 and was also committing gross human rights violations amid forcefully seizing the lands of Kashmiris, he added.\nThe Kashmiris had started civil disobedience movement in IOK, President Masood Khan said.\nThey, he said were depriving the Kashmiris from their livelihood and businesses where the latter had destroyed their reaped crops of walnuts, saffron and other eatables grown in IOK in protest to the Indian cruelties and injustice.\n“I would like remind India that AJK and Gilgit Baltistan (GB) people have convincingly defeated the Dogra Forces and are able to give crushing response to Indian aggression,” he said.\nThere was unusual movement of Indian forces across the line of control (LOC) where they had also installed missiles and at present removed the barbed wire from different locations along the LOC that had increased our reservations for a possible attack. “We have never accepted this barbed wire division between AJK and IOK where both parts are Pakistan.\nHowever, these barbed wires have been removed to call it terrorist intrusions made from AJK in the wake of any false flag operation being planned by India. The recent arrest of Jammu and Kashmir deputy superintentent of police (DSP) Davinder Singh had exposed India’s nefarious design to hold a terrorist attack in Delhi where the accused was reportedly involved in Pulwama Attack and Indian Parliament Building attack. We should never rule out the risk of war in the region whereas the entire Pakistani nation, AJK’s 4.2 million people and 2 million people of GB are ready to turn the valley into Indian soldiers’ cemetery.”\n.:Indian forces had a 72-year long history of fighting wars with weak and disarmed opponent whereas they had failed in their aggressions against rivals like China and Pakistan.\nHe said the people of AJK should prepare themselves to confront any eventuality or invasion to be carried out by India as the extremist Hindutva mindset dominating the Indian society could create war and serious destruction in the region.\nPresident Masood Khan said, “The world community for the first time has given preference to our narrative on Kashmir even European parliaments and United State Congress all have listened to our arguments on the Kashmir Issue. We thank China, Turkey, Malaysia, Iran, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Germany, Sweden and other developed nations for supporting Kashmir cause at global foras where it was needed to expand this association of our supporters and convince those nations like United States of America and other countries who are silent on the issue due to their vested interests.”\nIndia, he said was not willing to hold any talks on Kashmir Issue despite US President Trump’s offer for mediation which he later had conditioned with the consensus of both India and Pakistan. “There will be no dialogue on Kashmir without taking Kashmiris on board as Pakistan, AJK and India are the three parties in the talks with Kashmiris as the most significant part of the mediation process. No formula will be accepted against the aspirations and demands of Kashmiris,” he noted.\nHe mentioned that if President Trump wanted to arbitrate on Kashmir issue than he should better stop bloodshed and genocide of Kashmiris in IOK. He should raise his voice to end all this humanitarian crisis caused by India and asked her to withdraw his steps taken to crush Kashmiris’ struggle for just right to plebiscite and freedom, President Masood said.\nThe Foreign office was making all out efforts to highlight Kashmir Issue at diplomatic level and approaching global community to play its role in resolving the matter. However, the response of international community was not satisfactory which should be sincere and cordial to help Kashmiris get freedom from Indian clutches.\nHe said the political turmoil in the country, Middle East tension and Iran-US crisis created diversion to hamper Kashmir movement which had gained huge nationwide support after August 5, 2019. “Pakistan is making diplomatic and political efforts to once again raise Kashmiri people’s plight before the world where All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) leadership is also approaching the global leaders and countries to support Kashmir cause,” he added.\nHe said, “I do not believe that protests should be held outside Indian consulates whose members, at times, out of arrogance do not even accept your protest dossier. How could one seek justice from an oppressor and aggressor where the Kashmiri and Pakistani diaspora should engage huge protests in the state capitals like New York, Geneva and other cities to make the masses aware about Indian atrocities.”",
