However, the Cabinet decision was partially implemented to the extent that no new construction of government accommodations was being made after Cabinet decision, he said.\nHowever, the minister said rental ceiling could not be granted with salaries of Federal Government Employees due to involvement of heavy additional burden on government exchequer.\nHe said there was no such proposal under consideration in the M/o Housing and Works to pay rental ceiling to Federal Government Employees.",
