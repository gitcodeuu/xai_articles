We shall continue to play our responsible and positive role towards this end without compromising national security and defence of the motherland at whatever cost,” Inter Services Public Relations Director GeneralMaj Gen Asif Ghafoor in a tweet said quoting the COAS while chairing the 228th Corps Commanders Conference here at the General Headquarters.\nThe conference reviewed geo-strategic, regional and national security environment and discussed internal security, situation along borders, Line of Control (LOC) and Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJ&K). It also reviewed evolving security situation in the Middle East with reference to the US-Iran standoff and its implications on regional peace and stability.\nTaking account of repeated provocative statements of Indian military leadership regarding aggression against Pakistan, the forum termed it an irresponsible rhetoric with implications on regional peace and stability.",
