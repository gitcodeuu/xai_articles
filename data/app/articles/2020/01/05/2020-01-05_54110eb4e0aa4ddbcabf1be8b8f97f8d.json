Iran is a brotherly Islamic country, she added.\n“No one should disturb peace in the region, if the peace is disturbed then the Afghan peace process would also be ultimately disturbed”, she added.\nDr Firdous said Pakistan had won its generation-to-generation war against terrorism by rendering a large number of sacrifices.\nShe said armed forces of Pakistan were pride of the nation, adding, the defence of country was in very strong hands.\nShe said the whole nation stands united against terrorism, insurgency and extremism and was ready to defend every inch of the motherland while battling against terrorism shoulder to shoulder with the armed forces of Pakistan.\nThe SAPM said Pakistan would continue its frontline role for a durable peace in the region.\nThe SAPM said oppressed Kashmiri people had been facing lockdown for the last 154 consecutive days and were still eyeing on the United Nations to ensure early implementation of its resolutions regarding their right of self-determination.\nShe said the whole Pakistani nation stood united with the Kashmiri people in their freedom struggle.\nThe sun of Kashmiri freedom from Indian yoke would soon rise, she added.\nFirdous said Indian had badly crushed all basic, human, religious and freedom rights of Kashmiri people. She said oppressed Kashmiri people were not alone in this very hard time,\nadding that 220 million people of Pakistan were with them.\nShe said Pakistan would take Kashmir Issue to all the international courts, besides highlighting the Issue more effectively at all international fora including the UN Security\nCouncil.\nUnder the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistan was becoming a cradle of peace and tolerance as envisioned by Quaid-i-Azam.\nAll minorities were free to practice their religion in Pakistan as the constitution was guarantor of their rights, she said and added that white colour in national flag represented the minorities.\nIt was unfortunate that India, created in the name of secularism, was burning in flames of religious biasness and hatred and all minorities were protesting, she added.",
