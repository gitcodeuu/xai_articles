They only set target to cater around 200,000 people under those projects. Hunarmand Pakistan programme would impart training on artificial intelligence, robotics and many others,” he added.\nHunarmand Pakistan, he said was the New Year gift to the youth of Pakistan by the prime minister. The youth should prepare themselves to get skill set training under this programme which would help them to seek relevant jobs in the industry and market alongwith the opportunity to get assistance to set up new businesses as well, he added.\nDar said, “Our target is to benefit 80 percent youth of the country through Hunarmand Jawan Programme where they would get job and business opportunities after getting skill based training.”\nHe said it was the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan to have skill sets to enhance human resource in line with the job market trends and also enable the youth with better business opportunities.\nHe said, “The Startup Pakistan Programme is also providing assistance to the youngsters whereas an internship programme is also in the pipeline which would be launched within few months.

Prime Minister Imran Khan would also inaugurate an online portal for the registration of Hunarmand Pakistan Programme on the launching ceremony.\nTo a question, he said, “I would like the media to audit the Kamyab Jawan Programme which is completely transparent, on merit and free from any political interference.” All the loans issued under the programme were being issued through the artificial intelligence based online system.\nResponding to another query pertaining to Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) regime’s youth development programmes’ outcome, Dar said the global youth development index number of Pakistan was 89 in 2013 which declined\nto 154 in 2017 during their regime.\nHe said the PML-N’s youth development programme received only 109,000 applications in 5 years where Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Kamyab Jawan Programme got 1 million applications in just 15 days and I think the youth of the country for giving such overwhelming response to the programme.\n“The Kamyab Jawan Programme was not a loan or bank lending scheme rather it’s core objective was uplifting the local industry and small businesses. The youngsters who have a clear and properly designed business plan will get loan for implementing his idea,” Dar noted.\nThe SAPM mentioned that around 300,000 telephone calls were made to the applicants and 1 million confirmation messages had been sent to the youth in the first phase. “There is 25 percent ratio of successful candidates who have applied for the Kamyab Jawan Programme where most of the applications are being cancelled due to wrong age mentioned by the applicants and no business plan in place,” he added. He said that if 0.25 million youth get loans successfully.\nExecutive Director National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) Dr Nair Khan told the media that the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was great opportunity for Pakistan’s skilled youth.
