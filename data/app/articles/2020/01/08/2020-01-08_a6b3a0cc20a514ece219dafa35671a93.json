  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 8 (APP):Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan Wednesday said the passage of services chiefs bills by the Parliament was a practical example of political maturity shown by political parties on the issues of national unity and harmony.\nTalking to the media flanked by Leader of the House in Senate Shibli Faraz and Chairman of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting Faisal Javaid, she said all the political parties joined hands for passage of bills in the larger national interest .\nThere was need for further improvement in national harmony and unity on the issues of national importance, while keeping in view the regional situation, she stressed.\nDr Firdous said the political harmony and national unity exhibited on the issue was a clear message for the country’s enemies that the nation was united on important national matters. She said with the passage of bill, the lacuna in the relevant act had been removed as was directed by the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\nShe expressed the hope that the opposition would also support the government in legislation related to public-welfare issues. Disagreement on political matters was beauty of democracy and right of the opposition, she said, adding the government would always welcome constructive criticism and accommodate the proposals of the opposition in the larger national interest.\nSenator Shibli Faraz said it was praiseworthy that all the opposition parties supported the government in the legislation related to national security, and they would hopefully back other bills in the public interest, which would further strengthen the parliament.\nSenator Faisal Javaid said the passage of the bills from the Senate, where the ruling party did not have majority, was a proof of maturity shown by the opposition parties. The start of the year 2020 was very positive and and the opposition parties would hopefully support the government on bills like Zainab Alert Bill, he added.",
