The Middle East had been a victim of tension for long but the USA action of January 3 and the reaction by Iran on January 8 had further escalated the tension.\n“Pakistan believes that the escalation is neither in our interest nor in the region’s. We understand that the region cannot afford any other war,” he said.\nHe said Pakistan had been playing its role to settle the matters and keeping in view the situation, it had decided to promote diplomatic engagements with the countries of the region. During telephonic conversation with his regional counterparts, all were of the view to play their role for peace and stability of the region, he added.",
