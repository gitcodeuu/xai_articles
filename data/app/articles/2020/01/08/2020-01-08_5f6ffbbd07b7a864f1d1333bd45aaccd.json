The delegation appreciated the AJK president for effectively highlighting Kashmir issue on different forums in the world.\nEarlier talking to Chairman Gilgit-Baltistan Chief Minister’s Task Force on Social Youth Development Sajid Mir, the AJK president said that the people of both Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan are intertwined with historical, cultural and socio-economic bonds and their hearts beat together.\nHe maintained that geographically, the future of Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir is common as both the regions are part of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJK).\nHe said that as per his commitment made during his visit to Gilgit-Baltistan last year, seats reserved for the students of Gilgit-Baltistan in all public sector universities of Azad Kashmir have been increased manifold, and several more steps were being taken in this regard.\nHe said that that we are trying to vest 4.1 million youth of both the regions with the entrepreneurship skills by launching joint ventures, and to make them abreast with modern technologies.\nOn this occasion, Sajid Mir proposed to the AJK president to launch academic and tourism-related exchanges programs to bridge the gap between the youth of Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\nBesides, training programs should be launched for the unskilled educated youth of both regions. For this purpose, a training institute should be established in Islamabad by mutual cooperation of the governments of both Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan.\nHe said that promotion of tourism on this route of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor which is rich in mineral and other natural resources can turn this region into a developed and prosperous area.",
