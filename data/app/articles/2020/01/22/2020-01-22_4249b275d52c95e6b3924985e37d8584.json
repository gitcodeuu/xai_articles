Special Assistant to the PM on Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety Dr Sania Nishtar, Adviser on Establishment Mohammad Shehzad Arbab and Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan were also present on the occasion.\nAppreciating the tremendous philanthropic work being done in Pakistan, the president emphasized that the efforts must be coordinated in the same direction by taking all non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the loop for uplifting the marginalized strata of the society and to increase the philanthropic footprint across the country.\nIn that regard, he emphasized on the paramount importance of public-private partnerships.\nPresident Alvi underlined the need to bolster the endeavours for the protection and care of orphans and the people with disabilities, and empowerment of women, especially in the erstwhile Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA).\n“There are too many needy people who require help, therefore, we must make collective efforts to lift these people out of poverty,” he added.\nThe president launched PBM’s mobile app for the people with disabilities.\nHe also had a brief interaction with some beneficiaries of the Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal and visited its facilitation centre.
