The UNFPA has invested in policy-making and other areas as well.”\nDar said initial work on establishing National Youth Development Foundation had already begun, which would ensure an institutional framework for youth at the federal level.\nThe meeting was also attended by delegates of UNFPA and officials of the PM office.",
