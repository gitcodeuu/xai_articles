Rather, he maintained that the youth should also struggle for the liberation of a vast part of the state which is still under the unlawful occupation of the enemy.\nReferring to the situation prevailing in occupied Kashmir, the AJK president said that the Kashmiri people were undergoing the worst phase of their history, and they were being subjected to inhuman excesses for demanding their legitimate right and freedom.\nHe expressed the pleasure that the MUST had organized several seminars to highlight the liberation movement and the right of self-determination of the people.\nCongratulating the passed out students and their parents, Sardar Masood Khan said that education does not mean to have knowledge some specific aspect of life or to attain the degree, but the real education is to become the good citizens.\nHe also appreciated the MUST administration for imparting higher education to a large number of boy and girl students. However, he stressed that in order to promote research and innovation , we will have to acquaint the students with ultramodern technologies so that we can compete other nations in the world.\nSardar Masood Khan also greeted the MUST Administration for holding a successful job fair and establishing close contacts with the industrial sector.\nHe advised the students to become active members of society, and develop their own future. He said hundreds of thousands of Pakistani youth belong to Azad Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan. These youth are the real strength of the country, and they can change the fate of the country and bring Pakistan and Azad Kashmir in the world’s first rank nations.\nEarlier in his address Vice Chancellor MUST Prof. Dr. Maqsood Ahmed said that the University had recently introduced several new disciplines including media and communication, tourism and hospitality, forestry, sociology, and nutrition sciences etc. He disclosed that more than 84 departments were operation at the MUST at the moment.\nOn this occasion, the AJK president awarded degrees to 3,367 students, and gold medals to 70 boy and girl students for showing excellence in different disciplines. They included 2,289 under graduate, 250 MS and M.Phil. and five doctorate degree holders.\nEarlier in his welcome address, Vice Chancellor of the university, Professor Dr Maqsood Ahmed said that MUST has retained its W rating in the League Table positions in the HEC Quality Guide and the university established new departments including Media and Communication, Tourism and Hospitality, Forestry, Sociology, Nutrition and Dietetics.
