One such Mosque would be identified in Muzaffarabad. He proposed that trade between AJK and Malaysia could cover food, tourism, hospitality and the Halal meat industry.\nThe President said that this scope could be widened to include Kashmiri products and handicrafts such as Pashmina shawls, wooden handicrafts, papier-mache products, precious stones, horticulture, agriculture and fruits (apples, apricot, walnuts and mangoes). The two sides would follow up on these joint projects and programmes.",
