It will not be visible in the United States, central Canada and a majority of South America.\nThis is a penumbral lunar eclipse, and the Moon does not turn totally dark or go red in such eclipses. In total, four such penumbral lunar eclipses are expected to take place in 2020 with the first one on January 10, 2020.\nIn simple terms, a lunar eclipse takes place on a full moon when the Earth’s satellite passes through the planet’s shadow.\nHowever in a total lunar eclipse, the entire Moon is located in the Earth’s umbra or dark shadow, and this, in turn, makes the Moon appears red in color.\nNor is this a partial eclipse, where a small part of the Moon is inside the Earth’s umbra.\nThe other lunar eclipse this year will occur on June 5, July 5 and November 30.",
