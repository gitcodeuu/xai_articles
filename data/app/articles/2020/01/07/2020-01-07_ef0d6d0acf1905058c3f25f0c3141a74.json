The government would welcome the opposition parties’ positive and constructive suggestions in that regard, she added.\nChairman Senate Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting Faisal Javed said the legislation was of ‘prime national interest’ and linked with security issues, terming its unanimous passage “welcoming.”\nHe hoped that the opposition would go for constructive criticism on the government initiatives, adding there should be issue-based opposition in the Parliament for ultimate benefit of the common man.",
