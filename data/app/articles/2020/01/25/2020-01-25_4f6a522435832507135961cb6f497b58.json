The widow mother of one orphan child would be paid Rs8,000 and Rs12,000 will be paid to the mother of two orphan children after every three months for meeting the expenses of children.\nHe said he sincerely believes that a mother can better take care of her child as comparing to orphanage, so PBM was planning to help widow mothers.\nResponding to a question he said the deserving widows would be selected on merit sans sustaining any political influence.\nPBM has also written letters to multinational companies, chamber of commerce\nto donate in the ODSP the sizable chunk of their budget allocated for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) to help orphans in getting basic amenities of life.\nHe said PBM was also planning to distribute Energy Efficient Stoves in Gilgit-Baltistan and other vulnerable areas of the country to save frequent cutting of trees.\nThe multi purpose stoves can be used for cooking, keeping the room warm and also work as geyser.\nEach one stove costing Rs8,500, would be provided initially to 15,000 families for saving trees.",
