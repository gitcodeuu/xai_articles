The role of Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, was exemplary as he advocated Kashmir cause at diplomatic fora with great sagacity.\nShe said the voice of Kashmiris, their just, legal and democratic right to self-determination, resonated at the world’s biggest forum and the Indian claim of Kashmir, being its integral part, had been negated once again.\nShe said : “We demand that the world community should fulfill its promise of grant of right to self-determination with Kashmiris.”",
