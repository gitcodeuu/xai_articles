Not only the people of India were going to suffer, which were already suffering, but of the people of IOJK also, he added.\nImran Khan also mentioned the current situation in India, including the ongoing riots and demonstrations after the introduction of a new citizenship law by the Modi government.\nHe pointed out that eight million people of IOJK were in a state of siege for the last over five months. “And it is because of the RSS ideology, which believes that India only belongs to Hindus and the minorities are inferior.”\nTo a question about the human rights situation in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), the prime minister invited the world to visit and see the situation in AJK.\n“We invite the world and anybody can come and see the Pakistani part of Kashmir, then they go and see the Indian side of Kashmir,” he remarked.\nTo another question, Prime Minister Imran Khan said the silence of world on Kashmir was due to commercial interests because India was a big market. Secondly, he viewed that in the strategic Western mind, India was supposed to be a counterbalance to China.\n“Therefore you see a completely different approach…,” he remarked.",
