The content aired live during the programme prima facie appeared to be a willful attempt to debase and demean a state institution by dragging it unnecessarily in a debate.\nThe act of the host is also violation of various clauses of the PEMRA ordinance.\nIn view of these reasons the competent authority has decided to ban the programme for 60 days starting from January 16 under Section 27 of PEMRA Ordinance 2002 as amended by\nPEMRA ( Amendment) Act 2007.\nAppearance of the host of the programme Kashif Abbasi has also been banned for 60 days and during this period he will not conduct any other programme on any television channel as host, guest or the expert.\nIn case of non-compliance by the ARY News the authority shall proceed under PEMRA laws which may result in suspension and revocation of satellite TV channel conferred to Ms ARY communications Pvt Ltd ARY News",
