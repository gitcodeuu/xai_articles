Majority of the problems being faced by Nowshera people had been resolved, he said, highlighting the issues of gas, lands and railway crossings, which still needed to be addressed.\nHe requested Railways Minister Sheikh Rasheed Ahmed to grant a non-objection certificate for passing of a gas pipeline under the under railway tracks, so that the remaining areas of Nowshera could get the facility.\nCongratulating the Minister for Railways on the completion of dry port in record one year time, he requested him to rename it as Azakhel-Pirpai Dry Port, which was approved by Sheikh Rasheed.\nPervez Khattak also requested KP Chief Minister Mehmood Khan to set up the campus of Agriculture University in Nowshera.",
