He added several innovative steps have been taken to strengthen the health sector.\n“We are glad to give free space for the Langar at the PIMS. Now families of poor patients will be served here,” Dr Mirza said.\nSpecial Assistant to Prime Minister on Social Protection Dr Sania Nishtar said that Langars are part of PM’s ‘Mazdoor ka Ehsaas’ initiative and are primarily meant to serve meals to the poorest and most vulnerable segments of the society, especially daily wage laborers.\nShe said that the Prime Minister is personally committed to ensuring that no one goes to bed hungry in Pakistan and Ehsaas is working hard to realize that vision.\nDr Nishtar added “Under the Ehsaas framework, the government is mainly extending logistic support to Langars through a strategic approach to collaboration with zero cost implications.\nShe said that in the first phase, Ehsaas Saylani Langars will be opened in Peshawar, Swat, Multan, Lahore and Umer Kot in the next two months. Overall, in the public private partnership with Saylani Welfare International Trust (SWIT), Ehsaas will set up 112 Langars nationwide over a two-year period.\nThe first prototype Langar was inaugurated by the prime minister at Peshawar More in Islamabad, she added.\nExecutive Director PIMS Dr Ansar lauded the support of federal government and SWIT in opening this Langar at the PIMS vicinity and pledged full cooperation of PIMS in this noble cause.\nHe said that this effort will restore dignity and self-reliance to those that will otherwise go hungry, and they contribute to grassroots activism and social cohesion with food security and nutrition aims.\nAdvisor to Chairman SWIT Muhammad Afzal Chamdia thanked the federal government for extending on-the-ground facilitation and support and reassured that the trust will continue bringing all its kitchen and food distribution resources to feed the marginalized across Pakistan.\nHe said that the Ehsaas Saylani Langar project has specifically been designed with the ethos to contribute substantively to SDG 1 and SDG 2 like No poverty and Zero Hunger respectively.\nHe said that the advantage of Langars can be asked from the poor laborers who almost forego lunch or from those people who accompany their relatives coming for medical treatment from very far flung areas and have no means and money to get food and shelter and stay on footpaths.\nHe said that SWIT, which is partnering with Ehsaas on this Langar initiative, is a reputable Pakistani charity focusing on social welfare of the poor and distressed.\nThe trust provides over 70,000 meals a day and with government support this will be doubled, he added.\nHe said that under the Ehsaas Saylani agreement, the expectation is that the trust will provide healthy and nutritious meals, ensure quality of food, cleanliness in the premises and that in each langar, hand-washing will be promoted, trans-fats will not be used in cooking, salt will be kept to a minimum, and nutrition guidelines adopted by Ehsaas will be followed.",
