Indian Muslim Female Journalist Rana Ayyub’s dispensation of her duties in a daunting manner deserves acclaim.”\nDr Firdous said the occupied valley was turned into a jail which was barred from internet, land-line, mobile phone connectivity and any source of communication.\nIn such situation, the endeavour of a journalist to perform her duties was a great example of professionalism and courage, she added.\nShe went on to mention that Rana Ayyub had unveiled the lie of “all is well” narrative of the Modi regime in IoK along with highlighting the true situation of silence and deserted roads in the occupied valley.\nShe said, “The article Blood and Soil in Narendra Modi’s India by Rana Ayyub has been published in the magazine the New Yorker which is the acknowledgment of her remarkable capabilities.”",
