Majority of the expelled expats were from other countries and ‘only a few Pakistanis are among them,’ she added.\nShe said Pakistani High Commission in Malaysia was in contact with local authorities to ensure ‘registered employment’ for Pakistani manpower and added “We are taking measures to encourage emigration of Pakistanis through legal channels.”",
