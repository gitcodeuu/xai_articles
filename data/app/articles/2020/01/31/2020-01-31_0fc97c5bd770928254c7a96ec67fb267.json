We have been living in the past and denying the present… but we have to move the energy sector where it has to be.”\nHe said the government had decided that it would not continue to increase its footprint in the LNG industry and with that mind “we went ahead with the open access to the pipelines, terminals and there is no bar on setting up LNG terminal by private sector.”\nThe government would support the private sector players if they had buyers, suppliers and financial muscles, he said and asked the participants ”We create the environment… you do the business and compete the public sector entities.”\nCommenting on the future energy outlook, he said there would be a drastic increase in the electricity in the overall energy pie in next 10 to 20 years, stressing the need to adopt a holistic approach.\nHe also highlighted the role of renewable energy to meet the country’s electricity and petroleum sector requirements.\nHe said traditional coal technology had gone out of fashion and “my prediction is that by 20 years oil will be out of fashion completely and gas will be left.”\nDuring next 30 to 40 years, the gas would most depend on fossil fuels, which supplemented the variability of renewable energy and “of course battery technology can change that and will see major developments in battery technology in next 10 years.”\nSince the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government came into power in 2018, the SAPM said he kept hearing of different sectors capacity shortages, but “I came to conclusion that we do have really capacity constraints in most of our sectors but high level inefficiency and protected structures are the main reasons.”\nHe stressed the need for getting out of this mode, adding “our LNG sector is highly inefficient… we need to make it more efficient to lower the cost… We need to open up oil and gas sector and bring down the commodity rates for benefit of the common man.”",
