  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 23 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir President Sardar Masood Khan has said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir and Pakistan have always supported peaceful means for resolving the Jammu and Kashmir dispute, including through third party mediation.\n“Such a process can only supplement UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir adopted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter,” he expressed these remarks when asked to comment on President Trump’s latest statement from Davos that the United States could “help” (resolve the Jammu and Kashmir issue), a press release on Thursday said.\n“Any third party mediatory process has to be credible and should enjoy the support of all the parties to the dispute – Pakistan, India and the people of Jammu and Kashmir – and it should be within the parameters of the existing UN Security Council resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir and Article 33 of the UN Charter, which prescribes the modalities for seeking a solution through negotiation, mediation, arbitration or other peaceful means of their choice”, he added.\nAJK president said that an offer of mediation by President Donald Trump in July 2019 during the Pakistani premier’s visit to Washington had created a hype, especially because the US president had claimed that he had been asked to play such a role by Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, these hopes were dashed to the ground when the BJP government in India denied that any such suggestion was made by the Indian Prime Minister to President Trump. Shortly thereafter, India went on to revoke Articles 370 and 35-A in an attempt to terminate the disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir, he said.\n“Despite India’s adventurism and irredentism, the State of Jammu and Kashmir remains disputed and its future will be decided by its people”, he said.\n“It was an aggressive and aggravating move which apparently foreclosed all doors for multilateral diplomacy including third party mediation”, said Masood Khan, adding that since August 5 India has not only laid collective and punitive siege to IOJK but has been committing egregious crimes against humanity, including the abduction of more than 13,000 young boys, the establishment of concentration camps for youth and political activists, killings, unlawful incarcerations, molestation of women and trampling of health and education rights.\nThe president said that the occupation lockdown and communication blockade of IOJK was absolute which has crippled life and economy in the occupied territory.\nPresident Masood Khan said that the time was not yet ripe for serious negotiations and mediation. If, he said, President Trump or other world leaders and actors, including the UN Secretary-General intend to make an intercession, they should sharply focus on stopping the genocide in IOJK and reversing the illegal actions taken by India on August 5 and October 31, which are in flagrant violation of UN Security Council resolutions on Kashmir, as well as international law and conventions.\n“Kashmiris are dying and suffering and the powerful governments should not remain oblivious to this humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in front of their eyes. The world’s statesmen should intervene to save humanity in IOJK”, he said and added that President Trump should use his clout with India to ask it to stop the genocide in Kashmir and the continuing colonization of the territory.",
