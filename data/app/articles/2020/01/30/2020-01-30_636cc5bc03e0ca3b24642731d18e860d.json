  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 30 (APP):A spokesperson of the prime minister Thursday strongly contradicted a news item alleging any increase in the salary of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n“At a time when the prime minister was carrying out a campaign to slash the government’s\nexpenditures which he initiated from his own, the propagation of such a baseless and concocted news report was unfortunate,” the spokesperson remarked, according to a PM Office press release.\nHe said in the recent meeting, the federal cabinet, while amending the rules for perks and\nprivileges of the president and prime minister, allowed both of them to declare only one\nresidence as their camp offices.\nThe prime minister also directed the cabinet to define a limit of the expenditures permissible at the camp offices, contrary to the previous practices.\nThe spokesperson quoted the prime minister saying that the expenditures incurred on the\nhead of the government were borne out of the people’s hard-earned money, so it was a must to keep it at minimum level.",
