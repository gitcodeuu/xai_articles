  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 24 (APP):The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) Monday unveiled the wreckage of Indian Air Force (IAF)’s MiG-21 Bison, hit by a PAF fighter jet on February 27 last year, contradicting the Indian claim of shooting down a Pakistani F-16 aircraft.\nThe PAF’s Director Media Affairs flanked by Assistant Chief of Air Staff (Planning) Air Commodore Syed Omar Shah gave a detailed briefing to the media on the victory of “Operation Swift Retort” here at the Air Headquarters.\nHe also demonstrated the missiles of MiG-21 Bison recovered from the wreckage of IAF fighter being piloted by Wing Commander Abhinandan and shot down by the PAF fighter jets during the dogfight on February 27 last.\nAir Commodore Syed Omar Shah said the MiG-21 Bison was equipped with two R-73 Archer missiles and two R-77 Adder missiles on its left and right wings, which were never fired. Since the aircraft after being hit fell on the left side that completely damaged the two missiles attached on the left wing.\nThe two R-73 Archer and R-77 Adder missiles, which attached on the right wing of MiG-21, were recovered almost intact from the aircraft’s wreckage whereas the left wing missiles were damaged, particularly the R-77 Adder whose rocket motor got burnt under the rubble, he added.\nAir Commodore Shah noted that after analysis of the recovered missiles it was found that none of them was fired, rejecting the claim of IAF that Wing Commander Abhinandan had fired a R-73 Archer missile at the PAF jet before his aircraft was shot down.\n“The rocket motor has been found attached with the missile launcher that clearly proves that the MiG-21 piloted by Wing Commander Abhinandan did not fire any of its missiles and inflicted no damage on the PAF aircraft,” he maintained.\nThe Operation Swift Retort, he said, would be remembered as a “chronicle of valour and heroism”, which gave a message to the international community that their quest for peace should not be misconstrued by the enemy as their weakness.\nHe said though the independent sources had also denied the IAF’s claims of shooting down PAF’s F-16 fighter plane yet Wing Commander Abhinandan was awarded the highest military award by the Indian government. Moreover, the IAF chief’s claim of hitting an F-16 with a R-73 Archer missile was a question mark on the professionalism of his force, he added.\nAir Commodore Shah said when the IAF tried to violate Pakistan’s airspace it was “unilaterally perceived to be challenging the sovereignty of Pakistan”. In response to the the IAF’s violation of Pakistan’s airspace, four key targets had been locked, including Headquarters 80 Brigade Punch Sector, Headquarters 120 Brigade and two others. The PAF’s swift operation had surprised the IAF as they were unable to respond, he added.\nHe said the intruding two fighter pilots of IAF were fallen by the PAF whereas the former also shot down its own helicopter out of frustration.\nResponding to the media queries, the PAF Director Media said the Pakistan Air Force leadership was fully cognizant of the developments taking place in the neighbourhood, and had a plan of its modernization in place as per the changing levels of threat in the region.\nHe said the main reason behind a year long delay in making public the wreckage of MiG-21 Bison was a war-like situation which prevailed at the time of dog-fight.\nThe PAF pilots avoided to hit the locked targets due to the rules of engagement decided by the country’s leadership, he added.\nHe said the MiG-21 Bison was an upgraded version equipped with a beyond visual range missile system and advanced radars, and it was a great achievement of PAF pilots to hunt down it with precision.\nA video was also played showing independent aviation analyst Alan Warnes verifying the wreckage of destroyed MiG-21 Bison and the IAF Chief proclaiming that Wing Commander Abhinandan had hit the F-16 jet with a R-73 Archer missile.\nMeanwhile, PAF also released a new song “Allah-o-Akbar” sung by Shujah Haider to pay tribute to its brave fighter pilots, who shot down two intruding IAF fighter jets on February 27 last year.",
