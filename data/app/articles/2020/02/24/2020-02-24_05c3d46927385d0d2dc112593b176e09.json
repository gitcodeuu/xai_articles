  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 24 (APP):Special Assistant to Prime Minister for Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq Awan Monday asked Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Shehbaz Sharif to tell the nation about his time frame for returning from London to Pakistan.\nDr Firdous, in a tweet, said,“Shehbaz Sharif is one of the unique leaders in the country’s history for his specialty to run his party and the opposition through a remote control.”\nShe said Shehbaz Sharif was the main reason behind ruining the country’s economy as he and the Samdhi (Ishaq Dar) had done nothing in that regard during the PML-N government. “He just remained busy in making tall claims of addressing all outstanding issues like load-shedding etc. but actually he failed to do so,” Dr Firdous said.\nShe advised PML-N’s Rana Sanaullah to better focus on his drug case instead of thinking about forming his party’s government as he was still on bail and not acquitted by the courts.",
