The government has enhanced the doctor’s salaries and their other problems will also be solved,” he said.\nThe CM said all life-saving medicines are available in hospitals in abundance and there is no corruption scandal against the government. In fact, it is the most transparent government in the history of the country,” he added.\nHealth Minister Dr Yasmin Rashid termed the arrival of Chief Minister Usman Buzdar a good omen which had rejuvenated them. “No past government ever gave attention to utilising thr piece of land, but Chief Minister Usman Buzdar spearheaded this project.\nSecretary Specialized Healthcare & Medical Education Nabeel Awan said that the provincial government was working day and night to improve the health sector and new hospitals and medical colleges were being developed.\nEarlier, Secretary C&W gave a briefing on the project.\nProvincial ministers Mian Mehmood-ur-Rasheed, Mian Aslam Iqbal, MPAs, President PTI Central Punjab Ijaz Chaudhry, secretaries of SH&ME and C&W departments, VC and faculty of FJMU and students attended the ceremony.",
