  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 6 (APP):In accordance with the instructions of Prime Minister Imran Khan, the PM’s Performance Delivery\nUnit has added ‘Corruption/Malpractices’ category to the already existing categories of Pakistan\nCitizens’ Portal complaint lodging mechanism.\nThe category, titled as ‘Corruption/Malpractices’ has further been classified into six sub-categories namely, Financial Corruption, Violation of Merit/Rules,Power Abuse,Fraud/Forgery, Harassment and Inefficiency, a press release of the PM Office issued here Thursday said.\nThe classification of these various sub kinds has been keenly devised, keeping in\nview the nature of complaints received on the portal.\nMatters regarding corruption in government funds, bribery and kickbacks fall under\nthe Financial Corruption, whereas irregularities in recruitment, procurement and allotment\nprocesses comprise of the Violation of Merit/Rules category. Similarly favoritism,\nunauthorized privileges etc. represent Power Abuse section.\nHarassment, having become one of gravest challenges, is a pertinent subcategory of\nthe Pakistan Citizens’ Portal, where any issue regarding physical/sexual harassment,\nthreatening and blackmailing will be put under this head.\nLikewise, any complaint registered concerning fake documents and impersonation will\nbe listed under Fraud/Mockery section. Finally, cases of absenteeism, red-tapism and\nnon-serious attitude will constitute as Inefficiency.\nThe PMDU has done this categorization to facilitate public, as well as to safeguard the\nintegrity and reputation of individuals, as majority of reported cases received through the\ncitizens’ portal, represented mala fide and irrational content, for the purposes of achieving\npersonal desired outcomes.\nMoreover, this step will also enable the dashboard handlers/officers to systematically take up, or\ndrop (irrelevant) matters, and hence will accelerate the redressal process.\nIt has been further decided that the lodging of complaints in the category of “Corruption/Malpractices”\nby the citizens will be subject to some pre-defined system alerts of Do’s and Don’ts, which will be made part of the “User’s Guidelines Manual for Complaints and Suggestion Handling”, along with other changes and shall be circulated to all concerned departments.\nAs part of the above-mentioned Do’s and Don’ts, any complaint which does not provide authentic evidence will not be entertained. Furthermore, it has been prescribed to refrain from making complaints carrying baseless allegations as it is mentioned in the Holy Quran, that whosoever accuses an innocent, indeed takes upon himself the burden of a calumny and a manifest sin.\nIn addition to this, penal clauses will be highlighted through pop-up messages for those complainants whose complaints prove to jeopardize the reputation and integrity of other individuals, or will be found groundless.\nThe primary objective of PMDU is to provide a coherent and an efficient system for the amelioration of public grievances, and to take all necessary steps in this light. The activation of the “Corruption/Malpractices” option will not only help to filter out frivolous complaints, but will also help the officers to entertain only\ngenuine complaints, it said.",
