  "content": "Muhammad Naeem Khan Niazi\nLAHORE, Feb 03 (APP):Prime Minister Imran Khan’ recent state visit to Malaysia has vindicated Pakistan government’s stance and dissipated the doubts that the country might lose support of Malaysia, Turkey and Qatar.\nWith the state visit of the premier Imran Khan, the rumors have also died down that Malaysia was upset over Pakistan government’s decision not to attend Kuala Lumpur Conference. There was lot of discussion, then, about PM Khan’s decision not to travel to Malaysia to participate in the KL summit in December last.\nThe skeptics had maintained that Pakistan was the loser on the diplomatic front and would lose of the time-tested friends.\nThe truth is the government managed the KL summit situation in the best interests of the country and the Muslim world. All countries involved were on board and understood and respected Pakistan government’s decision to stay away from the Kuala Lumpur confernce.\nSince then Foreign Minister Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi has visited Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the US while Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Mohammed Bin Zayed visited Pakistan. What more evidence do we need that Pakistan is successful in being the partner in peace to the entire Muslim world and furthering the national interest.\nThe time has proved that it was a right decision to keep the Muslim countries together.\nThe government kept stressing that Pakistan has a renewed foreign policy approach. We are partners in peace to everyone. We are the country that is able to bring the Muslim world together. And we will continue to help alleviate tensions wherever we can.\nSometimes the optics may not be excellent. Emotive views may not like our rational, strategic approach.\nBut the government is focused on Pakistan s national interests. PM Imran Khan is a statesman and will do whatever is good for the country.\nWhy would Malaysia be so positive about the entirety of our bilateral relationship. You can judge by yourself the positivity around the trip once PM Imran Khan meets Mahatir Mohammed in Kuala Lumpur.",
