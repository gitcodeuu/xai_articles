If anyone had any reservation over any institution’s impartiality then he or she should knock the doors of the courts.\nReplying to a question, he said no one should be allowed to cultivate sugarcane in cotton belt but former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was the first one who had given permission in that regard.\nHe said most of the politicians were owners of sugar mills but Prime Minister Imran Khan had no sugar mill, accusing owners of the sugar mills were getting more benefits then the farmers.\nNadeem Afzl Chan said wheat crisis always created in the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) governments’ tenures and they did not increased the prices of wheat to promote farmers but the present government had increased wheat prices for giving benefits to the farmers.\nHe claimed that there were three division in the PML-N at the moment.\nTo another query, he said he was totally against the increase in salaries of the parliamentarians at this crucial time and proposed that rest of the segments of the society and public sector should reduce their perks and privileges for the sake of the country.",
