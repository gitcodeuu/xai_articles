  "content": "MULTAN, Feb 23 (APP):Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Sunday said Pakistan was hopeful for success of peace deal between United states (US) and Afghan Taliban which would be signed on February 29, in Doha.\nTalking to media persons here, he said Pakistan made sincere efforts in bringing the US and Taliban on negotiation table for establishing peace in war torn Afghanistan.\nPakistan always convinced the world that there was no military solution of Afghan issue and it could only be resolved through dialogue, Qureshi said adding, “the US President Donald Trump nominated Zalmay Khalilzad to move forward for peace process in Afghanistan.”\nHe said Pakistan also made Taliban understand that the issue could be resolved through negotiations only.\nPakistan wished that the both sides should reach to logical destination of peace in Afghanistan, he added.\n“Some powers do not want peace in Afghanistan and they are conspiring against peace process by disturbing law and order through bomb blasts in the country,” he said adding, “Such powers are spoilers and there is need to avoid and foil nefarious designs of these powers,” he added.\nQureshi also informed that working on Intra-Afghan dialogue process was in progress.\n“When there will be peace in Afghanistan, then rebuilding process will be initiated. Pakistan will also take part in rebuilding of Afghanistan,” the foreign minister said.\nResponding to a question, he said the incumbent government brought the Kashmir issue in the limelight of United Nations Security Council’s meeting properly after five decades.\nSimilarly, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was also taken up at different forums including the US Congress, House of Commons and some others, he added.\nThe foreign minister said recently, the UN Secretary General had visited Pakistan and he was briefed about human rights violations in the occupied Valley by the foreign ministry, Kashmir committee and other parliamentary committees concerned.\nAn eight-member delegation of House of Commons, visited Pakistan and similarly, it was also briefed about the human right violations in Indian occupied Kashmir (IoK), he added.\nThe foreign minister also informed that the minister for human rights would join a meeting in Geneva soon, wherein she would apprised the participants about human rights violations in IoK.\nResponding to question about rising prices of sugar and flour, he said Prime Minister Imran Khan had constituted a special committee to identify responsible persons for rising prices of sugar and flour.\nHe informed that the inquiry committee presented its report but it was incomplete so the prime minister ordered further inquiry. The committee would present its detailed report soon, Qureshi said.\nHe, however, added that the incumbent government provided Rs15 billion subsidy to Utility Stores Corporation (USC) to ensure sale of sugar and flour on controlled rates at its 4,000 outlets across the country. The government also banned export of sugar, he added.\nHe said the provincial governments had been directed to conduct raids at godowns to discourage hoarding.\nTo another query regarding the completion of government’s tenure, he said he was not agreed with Bilawal’s statement. A delegation of journalists from Punjab should visit interior Sindh and check the governance of Pakistan Peoples Party there, he added. Similarly, in Punjab, PML-N remained in government for nearly 30 years.\nQureshi posed a question that did the PPP and PML-N resolve problems of the country or provinces?\n“It is good for democracy that an elected government should complete its constitutional term,” Qureshi said and also added, “PTI assumed the government in difficult circumstances especially in economic crisis. PTI government is taking all possible steps to improve the economy.”\nHe informed that Ehsas Programme was launched recently to create employment opportunities for the unemployed and poor segments of the society.\nThe Foreign Minister Qureshi said India could not succeed in its nefarious designs for pushing Pakistan into Blacklist during the meeting of Financial Action Task Force (FATF). All the member countries except India, were satisfied over the steps taken by Pakistan government.\nAbout coronavirus, he said there was no death in Pakistan due the novel coronavirus. However, the government was highly vigilant, he added.\nQureshi assured that Chinese government was also taking special care of Pakistanis, working or studying in China.\nAbout reports of coronavirus in Iran, he said Balochistan government would surely be taking steps in that regard.\nHe also congratulated nation over successful conduct of Pakistan Super League (PSL).\nHe said arrival of foreign players in the mega event of PSL was, in fact, an expression of confidence on Pakistan by the world. Those who were earlier talking about terrorism in Pakistan, were now terming it a best tourism spot, he added.\nAbout US President Trump visit to India, he hoped that the US President Trump would surely talk about Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) and siege of occupied Jammu and Kashmir to the Indian government.\nQureshi hailed services of Pakistan army for maintenance and promotion of peace in the country. He appreciated the performance of Pakistan Air Force, which shot down two Indian planes on February 27, soon after Balakot incident.\nHe informed that Prime Minister Imran Khan would also address to nation on occasion of first anniversary of shooting Indian planes.",
