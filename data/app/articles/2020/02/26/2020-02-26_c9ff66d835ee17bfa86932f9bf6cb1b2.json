Necessary legislation in that regard was in the process, after no media institution could abruptly sack its workers, besides not paying their salaries in time.\nNo institution could survive without taking care of its workers, she added.\nDr Firdous said she was well aware of the problems being confronted by the journalists.

The government’s efforts for the implementation of the Wage Board Award should be appreciated, she added.\nShe said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government was committed to eliminate mafias working in every field of life. It was the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan, who had not budged from reforming the system.\nThe prime minister, she said, was continuously challenging the beneficiaries of the system as surrender was not an option for him. “We have to defeat the mafias for a corruption-free society.”\nDr Firdous urged the media to support the government in its fight against the mafias. Reforming the judicial system was in progress as the government had changed the criminal procedure code. However, there were hurdles in its implementation.
