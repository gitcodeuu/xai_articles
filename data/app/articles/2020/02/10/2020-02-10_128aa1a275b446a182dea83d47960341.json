This is backed by strong institutions and organizations with the requisite authorities, resources and trained manpower for effective implementation.\nPakistan’s affiliated institutes at Centre of Excellence on nuclear security had transformed into an international hub for imparting training and sharing the best practices in the area of nuclear security.\nIt said Pakistan’s nuclear security arrangements had been recognized at the international level by several high ranking officials and experts.\nThe booklet highlights nuclear security systems and measures deployed by Pakistan in accordance with national and international obligations.\n“Multi-layered defence is the cornerstone of Pakistan’s nuclear security architecture. A concept of 5Ds is followed to respond to these threats. These 5Ds include: deter, detect, delay, defend, and destroy,” it added.\nIt said relying on modern technological solutions and the requisite human resource, Pakistan was fully capable of preventing and responding to the entire spectrum of challenges encompassing physical protection, computer and information security, transport security as well as insider threat mitigation.\n“We believe that the Agency’s undiminished focus on the promotion of peaceful uses of nuclear technologies, in particular through technical cooperation with the developing countries, can foster better appreciation and ownership for its activities in the field of nuclear security,” the booklet said.",
