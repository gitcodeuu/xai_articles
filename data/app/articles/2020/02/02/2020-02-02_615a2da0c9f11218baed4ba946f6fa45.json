On 13th October 2016, during the tenure of Gayyoom’s half brother Abdulla Yameen, the Maldives left the Commonwealth citing that the organization “sought to become an active participant in the domestic political discourse in the Maldives, which is contrary to the principles of the Charters of the UN and the Commonwealth”.\nHowever, the incumbent President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih had committed to rejoin the Commonwealth and thus his government formally requested to rejoin the organization on December 6, 2018 which was finally approved making the country to become the 54th member.",
