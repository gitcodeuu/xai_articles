She said the United States Congress, European Union Parliament, United Kingdom, human rights organizations and international media criticized India for its illegal annexation of Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe minister said Pakistan’s stance was acknowledged due to the speech of Prime Minister Imran Khan at UN General Assembly.
