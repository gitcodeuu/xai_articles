  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 13 (APP):Pakistan on Thursday expressed concern over the approval of the United States for sale of integrated air defence weapon system to India, saying the step would disturb the peace of already volatile region.\n“The decision of U.S will have serious impact on the stability of the region,” Foreign Office Spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said at a weekly press briefing at Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\nThe U.S. Department of State on Monday approved a possible sale to India of military equipment, comprising an integrated air defense weapon system (IADWS). According to the U.S. Defence Security Cooperation Agency, the cost of the sale, if finalized, would be approximately $1.867 billion.\nThe FO spokesperson said the South Asia could not afford a race on weaponry among the nations.\nOn Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJ&K), she said the 193rd day of lockdown had deprived the people from basic amenities of life as the valley had turned into a largest human jail in the history.\nShe expressed concern over the continuous ceasefire violations by India along the Line of Control resulting in several casualties, and said Pakistan had warned international community of any possible false flag operation by India.\nSuch provocations by the RSS-inspired Bharatia Janta Party government are designed to distract the consistent human rights violations, being carried out in Indian Occupied Kashmir, she added.\nShe called upon the international community to take notice of the situation as any irresponsible act by India could prove disastrous to regional peace and stability.\nOn visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Pakistan today, she said Pakistan and Turkey enjoyed unique brotherly relationship as both supported each other on important issues.\nShe said the visit would further strengthen the existing relationship into a more meaningful\npartnership.\nOn upcoming visit of UN Secretary General Antoneo Guterrus to Pakistan on February 16-17, the spokesperson said he would attend a conference, marking the 40 years of Pakistan hosting the Afghan refugees.\nShe said the conference would will be attended by representatives from 20 countries as the\noccasion would showcase Pakistan’s goodwill and compassion for refugees for four decades.\nThe international conference is taking place at a juncture when peace in Afghanistan has new prospects, she added.\nShe said the the UN Secretary General would also visit Lahore and Gurdwara Kartarpur\nSahib.\nOn favour from other countries for voting on upcoming decision on Financial Action Task Force (FATF), she said “We are always hopeful, always optimistic. We have international partners who would support us.”",
