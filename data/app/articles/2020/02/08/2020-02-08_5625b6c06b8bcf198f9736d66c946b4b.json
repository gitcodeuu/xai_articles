  "content": "LAHORE, Feb 8 (APP):Federal Minister for Education and Professional Training Shafqat Mahmood on Saturday inaugurated the Lahore Eastern Bypass at Mehmood Booti .\nAddressing the inauguration ceremony, he congratulated the National High Aurthority\n(NHA) over the completion of the project and termed it a great achievement.\nThe minister said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had decided to\ncomplete ongoing uplift projects. He said the project would facilitate people from Islamabad as they would not have to go to Thokar Niaz Baig to enter the city.\nHe said traffic coming from Sialkot would also get benefit from the bypass which\nwould put positive impact on traffic flow.\nHe said 60 per cent development funds had been released, adding the incumbent government was working on various development works as per its manifesto.\nTo another query, he said, it was illogical that health treatment of Nawaz Sharif\ncould not be carried out in the absence of Maryam Nawaz, adding that the matter was sub-judice so it was not appropriate to comment on it.\nHe said the PTI and its allies were on the same page and did not have any issue.\nMNA Malik Karamat Khokhar, NHA Chairman Sikandar Qayyum and others were also present.",
