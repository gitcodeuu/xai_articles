Resolution of this dispute is crucial for world peace and security,” Khan emphasized, saying that the any conflict between the nuclear neigbours will not only be a regional but global threat.\nThe AJK president said Kashmir was not a bilateral dispute between Pakistan and India but it was a trilateral issue and the people of Jammu and Kashmir who were to determine their own future were the key party to the dispute. “The slogan of Azadi (freedom) which India wanted to quell in IOJK and for this purpose deployed its 900,000 troops in occupied Kashmir, was now being heard across the length and breadth of India itself”, he said.\nResponding to a volley of questions, Sardar Masood Khan rejected the impression that lack of construction and development had left Azad Kashmir underdeveloped. Today, he added, “we have five public sector universities, three medical colleges, hundreds of colleges and thousands of schools besides roads that connect districts and subdivisions of AJK.”\nThe people of AJK, he said, had come a long way and were now far prosperous and well off than in the past.\nHe said efforts were underway for the construction of basic infrastructure to promote tourism in the liberated territory, provide universal access to health facilities as per international standards, and to introduce telemedicine far flung areas.",
