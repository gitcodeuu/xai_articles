  "content": "LAHORE, Feb 8 (APP):Punjab Governor Chaudhry Mohammad Sarwar said on Saturday that Kashmir is not an issue of Pakistan or Kashmiris only but of the entire world, as peace cannot be established in the region till settlement of the long-drawn issue.\nHe expressed these views in a meeting with Prince Mozi Dlamini, son-in-law of Nelson Mandela, and former Sindh governor Lt-Gen (retd) Moeenuddin Haider, here at Governor’s House on Saturday.\nCh Sarwar said that if the resolutions on Kashmir issue could be presented in the European Union, then why not in the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The Muslim Ummah must get united for settlement of Kashmir and Palestine issues, he added.\nHe said, “Time is ripe that the United Nations and all other international organisations play their role in resolving the Kashmir and Palestine issues.\n“India must be compelled to not only stop atrocities against Indian Muslims and people of occupied Kashmir but also resolve the Kashmir issue in accordance with the UN resolutions.”\nCh Sarwar said that Prime Minister Imran Khan was rising as a “Leader for Peace” on the world horizon. “The minority communities are enjoying complete freedom in Pakistan, while India had turned from a secular to an extremist state where minorities and humanity are being massacred,” he added.\nLater on, the Punjab governor participated in a ceremony held on the first anniversary of historic document ‘Global Peace and Fraternity for living together’.\nBadshahi Masjid Khateeb Maulana Abdul Khabir Azad, Kul Masalik Ulema Board Chairman Maulan Asim Makhdoom, Archbishop Sebastian Francis and a large number of people from various religions participated in the ceremony.\nPunjab Governor said, “Terrorism has no place in Islam which always advocates peace, love and brotherhood. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, he added, the steps taken by the incumbent government to forge interfaith harmony had never been witnessed in the past.\n“Today Pakistan has become cradle of peace due to supreme sacrifices of Pakistan Army and other law-enforcement agencies, and the entire nation is standing with the Pakistan armed forces and other security agencies.”\nPrince Mozi Dlamini strongly supported Pakistan’s viewpoint on the Kashmir issue and restoration of peace, and also appreciated Pakistan Army’s sacrifices in the war against terrorism.\nMeanwhile, addressing an oath-taking ceremony of traders, Punjab Governor Ch Mohammad Sarwar said that Prime Minister Imran Khan had made it clear that corruption would not be tolerated at any level.\nNo doubt, resolving traders’ problems was inevitable to strengthen the country economically and the government was advancing successfully on economic front, he added.",
