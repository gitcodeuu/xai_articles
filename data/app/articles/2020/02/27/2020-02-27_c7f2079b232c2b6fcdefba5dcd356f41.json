Babar Iftikhar on Thursday.\nAddressing a news conference, he reiterated the firm resolve of Pakistan government,\nArmed Forces and the nation to stand united for the country’s defence and warned the adversaries not to test Pakistan’s capability and resolve.\n“There is no room for war between two nuclear powers. We are aware of India’s capability and are ever ready to defend our motherland. If war starts, it will have\nunintended and uncontrollable consequences,” he said while answering a question\nabout Indian military buildup.\n“We are taking their statements and designs seriously and will defend our\nmotherland at any cost. We always prefer to ensure peace in the region but\nour core capability is very much in place,” he added.\nHe said Pakistan was also having an eye on India’s military spending that\nwas Pakistan centric and India was among top three countries in the world,\nin terms of military spending.\nIn this context, he specifically mentioned to February 27, 2019 operation\n‘Swift Retort’ and said despite India’s massive spending on defence, Pakistan\nshowed it capacity and capability by shooting down two Indian planes and\narresting its Squardon Leader Abhinandan.\n“After the Pulwama incident, Indian jets intruded into Pakistan’s territory in the\ndark of night but our quick response made them run while dropping their payload\nin forest area,” he said. “But, we responded in broad day-light, targeting six military installations, hitting down their two fighter jets while Indian military hit down its own helicopter in desperation.”\nBriefing the media on national security, Line of Control and Kashmir situation\nand Operation Radd-ul-Fasad in connection with February 27, 2019 operation\n‘Swift Retort,’ Director General ISPR Babar Iftikhar said during 73-year history\nof the country, Pakistani nation and forces stood united in every need of hour.\nHe said February 27 can validly be described as ‘thanksgiving day’ and\nmanifests the firm resolves to defend the country and nation. “After February 14,\n2019 Pulwana incident, India leveled baseless allegations despite the fact that\nPakistan had offered all kind of cooperation for probe into the incident.”\nIn this situation, he said Pakistan played the role of a responsible nation as it\nalways endeavored for peace in the region. “But, India resorted to a cowardly act\nof intruding into Pakistan’s airspace. Our forces were ready and Indian warplanes\nhad to run away after dropping their payload in our forest area.”\nHe said :“This was an open challenge for Pakistan and our forces responded\nin broad day-light, engaging six targets and hitting down two Indian planes and\narresting their Squadron Leader.”\n“February 27 is a momentous day and a glaring example of our valor and\ncommitment to national security as once again our forces fully came up to\nmasses’ expectations,” he added.\n“With the reference to this day, we salute all our martyrs and survivors of\nwars since 1947 as we reiterate to fight out all internal and external threats\nfaced to the motherland,” he said.\n“There is no price for honor and dignity and our forces and nation have\nbeen sacrificing for honor and national defence”, he added.\nHe said : “Pakistani leadership and Armed Forces are well aware of\nIndian acts that always posed serious threat to regional peace despite our\npeace overtures.”\nBriefing the media on Operation Radd-ul-Fasaad, DG ISPR Maj Gen Babar Iftikhar said that in the past two decades, Pakistan had fought a successful war against terrorism.\n“Our nation and forces have not only fought against terrorism to ensure peace in our region, but rather contributed towards global peace through extraordinary sacrifices\nand efforts”, he added.\nHe said Radd-ul-Fasaad had completed its three years and this Operation was a\nvery significant step towards long lasting peace in the region. “The Pakistan Armed\nForces had made numerous achievements as in Kinetic Domain over 1,200 military\nand around 150,000 intelligence based operations were conducted killing 17,000\nand confiscating 450 tonnes of explosive from terrorists’ possession.”\nIn warfare and other domains important legislation was made while 1000 Al\nQaeda terrorist were either killed or apprehended in various anti-terrorism\noperations, he said . Intelligence sharing was made with around 70 countries helping\nin eliminating several international terrorist networks, he added.\nThe DG ISPR informed that a total of 46,000 square kilometers area was cleansed\nof terrorists and writ of the state was established. “Today, there is no such area in the country where terrorists can challenge writ of the government,” he added.\nHe said overall 80,000 sacrifices were rendered by Pakistan in the war against\nterrorism as the country suffered over US$ 180 billion economic losses.\nMajor General Babar Iftikhar said the merger of tribal areas into Khyber\nPakhtunkhwa and enforcement of civil administration in those areas was\nthe victory of peace.\nHe said: “Operational Radd-ul-Fasaad” had only one agenda and that was\nstable, peaceful and normalized Pakistan.\n“Pakistan’s journey from terrorism to tourism has been challenging and\nnerve-testing. Today, the country’s sports arenas have reinvigorated and\npeace is all around,” he added.\nOn the other hand, he said, in India the minorities were fighting and\nstruggling for their freedom and existence whereas in Pakistan the minorities\nhave the right to practice their religious customs and live freely. “We honor\nand esteem the white color in our flag and respect minorities rights,” the\nDG ISPR said.\nHe said Pakistan made many sacrifices to defeat terrorism in the country\nand we were fully capable of dealing with any sabotage activities. “No one\nshould test our capabilities and qualities as we will make every sacrifice to\nprotect our motherland and safeguard its sovereignty.”\nCommenting on prevailing situation along the Line of Control (LOC), ISPR DG Major General Babar Iftikhar said Pakistan was facing consistent threats from India at its eastern border.\n“Pakistan’s civil and military leadership is fully aware of what India is playing, in desperation, to divert attention from its internal disruption. India’s this act is\nextremely dangerous for the regional peace, ” he said.\nDuring the last few years, he said India did increase the ceasefire violations\non the LOC to sabotage Pakistan’s achievements in the ongoing war against\nterror.\n“During the current year so far, India committed 384 ceasefire violations in which our two innocent citizens embraced martyrdom and 30 received injuries,” he said and regretted that Indian forces were even not hesitating to target school-going children\nin Azad Jammu and Kashmir.\nIn 2018, he said highest casualties were recorded, while the highest number of ceasefire violations on the LOC was registered in 2019. “The graph of violations\non LOC started increasing after India’s current government came into power in\n2014.”\nThe ISPR DG said Pakistan’s Armed Forces gave befitting response to India’s increased ceasefire violations, causing heavy losses to the adversary.\n“We are a responsible and professional force; we only target military installations, when we\nare provoked, while Indian army opens fire on unarmed civilians.”\nHe said the Jammu and Kashmir was a recognized dispute between Pakistan\nand India, and for resolution of which, the United Nations Secretary Council\nhad passed several resolutions.\nHe said India had not accepted the reality of the sub-continent’s partition and creation of Pakistan since 1947 by heart till-date, and India’s present leadership\nhad reiterated it time and again.\nHe said Indian brutalities in Occupied Kashmir had been continuing unabatedly\nfor the last 73 years, adding the people of Kashmir were facing increased suppression for the last 207 days due to the India’s August 5 action.\n“Life is completely paralyzed in Occupied Kashmir and genocide of Kashmiris is being done there. There is a complete lockdown situation,” he said adding today\nthe Kashmir issue was not only a dispute of ideology and geography, but now it\nhad started becoming the biggest human rights violations tragedy in the world\nhistory.\nHe said Genocide Watch, human rights organizations and international media\nhad exposed India’s state terrorism despite the ‘complete lockdown’ there, which triggered protests in the world and across India. “The rising voices against brutality cannot be suppressed. The Kashmir issue once again has fully gained global\nattention.”\nThe United Nations, he said had reiterated its stance that the Kashmir issue\nshould be resolved in line with the resolutions passed the Security Council. World powers and key leaders had expressed concerns over the prevailing situation in Occupied Kashmir, he added.\n“Resolution of the Kashmir issue is not only our national interest but also a guarantee for our national security. In Kashmiris’ movement for freedom, we\nwere, are and will remain with them forever”, he added.\nAnswering a question, the ISPR DG said the world, especially Pakistan,\nwas cognizant of the miseries of besieged Kashmiris, adding all options were\non the table to resolve the Kashmir issue.\nHe said the Kashmir issue had become a flashpoint globally as Pakistani leadership had done its best to highlight the issue at international forums.\nReplying to question about the ongoing US-Taliban peace dialogue and\nsubsequent agreement, he said there was no report of any interruption in\nthe dialogue process, expressing the confidence that the upcoming agreement\nwould yield good results. “No one, other than Pakistan, is more aspiring for\npeace in Afghanistan… and we are hoping for the best.”\nTo another question about reports of Coronavirus cases in Pakistan, he\nsaid the Ministry of Health had made all-out measures to control the virus as\nonly two cases had so far been identified, which showed that our efforts\nwere paying-off.\nHe said the Armed Forces were ready to assist the government in that\nregard, whenever they were called.",
