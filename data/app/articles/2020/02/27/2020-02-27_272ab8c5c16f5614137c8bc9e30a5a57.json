  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 27 (APP):Pakistan on Thursday said it was actively engaged with the Iranian government to deal with the spread of coronavirus and the evolving situation.\nIn her weekly press briefing, Foreign Office Spokesperson Aisha Farooqui said Pakistan fully supported the efforts of Iranian authorities in managing the outbreak of the virus. “We stand in solidarity with them.”\nShe said Pakistan’s embassy and two consulates in Iran were alert and monitoring the situation closely and were reaching out to the Pakistani community there including Zaireen and students.\nHelplines had also been established in the embassy and the consulates to provide necessary updates and assistance to the community members, she added.\nHowever, she said so far no decision had been taken to suspend flight operations between Pakistan and Iran. “Whatever needs to be done will be done and the government will take the best possible measures,” she added.\nAisha Farooqui expressed grave concern over the violence against Muslims including desecration of mosques in New Delhi and said Pakistani leadership as well as the international community had also raised their concerns on the situation.\nShe said the Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission (IPHRC) of OIC had also regretted the loss of innocent lives and strongly condemned violence against Muslims in India by extremist Hindus.\nShe said the state oppression that the Kashmiri people had been suffering for decades at the hands of Indian authorities now found its way in the Indian capital.\nShe said Pakistan had welcomed the mediation offer made by US President Donald Trump during his visit to India.\nShe pointed out that the US president also lauded Pakistan’s efforts against terrorism during the visit, adding, the very remarks were a manifestation of upward trajectory in Pakistan-US relations.\nShe said there was an increasing awareness in the world that resolution of Kashmir dispute was the key for peace and stability in the region.\nThe spokesperson, however, said Pakistan had concerns over the defense deals between the US and India especially the sale of sophisticated weapon system to New Delhi. This, she said, would further destabilize the already volatile region.\n“We have alerted the international community many times about India’s aggressive designs not only towards Pakistan but also other countries in the region,” she added.\nShe said Pakistan had been the victim of state-terrorism emanating from the eastern border, adding, they had shared their concerns in this regard with the international community.\nAisha Farooqui said Pakistan welcomed the peace deal to be signed between the US and Afghan Taliban on Saturday and expressed the confidence that the deal would pave the way for intra Afghan dialogue.\n“Pakistan welcomes this and hopes that it would pave the way towards intra Afghan dialogue and to enduring peace and stability in Afghanistan and in the region. We hope all Afghan parties would seize this historic opportunity and steer the Afghan nation towards peace and prosperity,” she remarked.\nShe said Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi would represent Pakistan at the peace agreement signing ceremony.\nThe spokesperson said Pakistan had played a significant role in facilitating the peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan.\nShe confirmed that the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Pakistan was on the cards.
