He maintained that the UN Women’s campaign of “Generation Equality: Realising Women’s Rights for an Equal Future,” calls for equal pay, equal sharing of unpaid care and domestic work, an end to sexual harassment and violence against women, healthcare services that respond to their needs, and women’s equal participation in political life and in decision-making in all spheres of life.\nEarlier in his welcome remarks, Dr Nassar Ikram, NUST Pro-Rector Research Innovation and Commercialisation (RIC), said that the dialogue provided an ideal platform to discuss and devise ways to achieve the SDGs through engaging and empowering women, and ensuring their inclusion in every development agenda.\nTalking about NUST efforts towards women empowerment, he said that NUST is cognisant of its role in eliminating the gender gap through ensuring right to access to education for all, inclusion through skills development, access to employment, and so on.\nThe UN Women in Pakistan works with public and private partners to create a conducive environment, where women can benefit from equal social and economic development opportunities; live a life free from violence in private and public spaces, and where survivors of violence can access quality essential services.\nOther speakers included Ms Uzma Kardar, Member Provincial Assembly Punjab; a NUST alumna; Ms Maya Zaman, a successful entrepreneur from the Transgender community; and Ms Aqsa Ajmal, a NUST student who recently made headlines for seizing a slot amongst 6 global finalists for the Lexus Design Award, to be held in Italy later this year.\nA large number of women across different professions, and students participated in the event.
