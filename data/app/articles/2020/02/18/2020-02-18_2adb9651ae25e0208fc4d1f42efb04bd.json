He regretted that his generation didn’t succeed in achieving desired goals to reverse emergency in climate change, fair distribution of resources among all segments of societies, regulation of new technologies and avoiding conflicts.\nTerming climate change defining issue of the age, Guterres said: “We do not have the political will to reverse the climate emergency, we live in despite being citizens of a global world”. He said the world today was faced with the challenges of record increase in levels of gaseous emissions in the air, land and sea, rising temperatures, soaring water levels due to melting of glaciers.\n“There is a war between humans and the nature and the nature is striking back with enormous power”, he observed, adding that we have not yet taken necessary decisions to reverse this effect.\nThe UN Secretary General said, as a world body, we must ensure that the temperatures don’t rise more than 1.5 degrees, and the carbon emission remain low in the next decade.\nHe said UN’s ‘Youth Climate Summit’ in September last year was a means to force politicians to understand that things have o change on climate.\nGuterres said mobilization of the youth was important as the climate challenges were to effect more adversely to the young generations in the coming decades. Regarding Globalization, he said: “Despite producing enormous benefits to the world in trade etc. globalization has produced increase in poverty levels which is a threat to the social cohesion of societies”.\nHe said the governments, across the globe, must formulate economic and social strategies\nunder which globalization worked for all and no none was left behind.\n“If the things moved in the current manner, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) for 2030 will not be met”, he warned.\nGuterres stressed the need to ensure parity to the women in world affairs, adding that women were not playing the role they should play in world affairs. Advocating equality for women, he said the male dominated global society had failed to check the conflicts for being more aggressive while presence of women in international bodies had compassion to control the permanent cycles of conflict.\nGuterres said the UN was evolving a strategy under which the role of men and women was equal in all world bodies by 2028, adding that he had appointed equal number of men and women as Assistant Secretary Generals and Under Secretary Generals to ensure equality among the sexes.\nStressing the need to regulate modern technologies, the UN chief said the youth had a key role to play as the world regulates or devises a mechanism in checking the wrong use of the modern technologies like the digital society; artificial intelligence and genetic engineering become a problem for the world societies.\nHe said the enormous potential of the new technologies must be utilized, but warned that it would be during the life of the youth of today that the world would see the full impact of new technologies“Many things could become a nightmare if they are not properly regulated and the new technologies like the internet and cyber space could become a tool for terrorists if not properly channeled”.\nHe said that the wanted ban on automatic weapons as these killed people indiscriminately, adding that the inclusion of youth in decision making was vital as new generations was more exposed to the threats by the new technologies, if not properly regulated.\nHe said: “Terrorism, hate speech and criminal organizations use internet and cyberspace to divide societies”, urging in order to overcome all challenges faced the world, the youth must have a fundamental voice and role.\nGuterres hailed optimism of the youth towards the future of globe, adding that their participation was vital to shape future of the world.\nResponding to queries from the students and faculty, the UN Secretary General said civic space was shrinking in many societies, adding that more human rights activists were in jails today and the young people could play a vital role in safeguarding human rights in societies.\nAbout the single use plastics ban, Guterres said, single use plastics posed a great threat to\nenvironment, adding that most countries had banned the use and Pakistan was one of those.\n“Rawanda, an African country, banned single use plastics some 15 years ago”, he responded.\nHe said, plastics pose a very serious problem under the seas with micro-plastics and nano-plastics.\nHe urged the governments to ban it across the globe.\nTo another question, he said the UN was taking steps to ensure equality among the people as well as the equality among the states, adding that ‘Power has to be taken, it was not given’. He said the UN system was evolved after the WWII and it must not disconnect with the people, otherwise, it would create mistrust.\nOn human rights in Kashmir, the UN Secretary General said the people of Kashmir have every right to humane treatment and protection of their political rights and fundamental freedoms. He said human rights are not political rights but they are political, economic and social rights – some of the political rights are pushed back.\nAbout regulating the social media, the UN chief said a multi-stake holders approach was needed to adopt laws. He said companies were averse to regulation a decade ago and today organization like the Microsoft was asking for regulations’ adding the UN had constituted a high level committee to recommend to the UN more flexible mechanism from lawyers, companies and civil society.\nTo a query, he said the UN was making efforts to ensure the youth were inducted in the positions of responsibility in the member states, besides presence of the youth members in the political bodies as well as the UN.\nLater, the UN Secretary General had a souvenir photograph with the students and faculty of LUMS.",
