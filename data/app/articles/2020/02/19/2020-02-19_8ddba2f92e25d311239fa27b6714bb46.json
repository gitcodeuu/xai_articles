  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 19 (APP):The British lawmakers, whom India denied a visit to Kashmir, stated on Wednesday that situation in the Occupied Valley had turned into a serious human rights issue, demanding all states under the United Nations Charter to notice and act.\nLawmakers Debbie Abrahams and Imran Hussain in a press conference along\nwith Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi at the Foreign Office, called for an\nimmediate response by international community to take urgent notice of worsening\nhuman rights situation in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nDebbie Abrahams, who chairs All Parties Kashmir Group, was deported from\nDelhi a day ago for her open stance on the ongoing human rights situation in\nKashmir.\nAbrahams said the group members would report back to their parties on India\ndenying the visit and Pakistan allowing for an independent monitoring of its\nrespective side of Kashmir.\n“We are not here for sight-seeing, but because that we are deeply concerned\nabout the human rights situation in Kashmir, and we are constantly raising it,”\nshe said.\nShe hoped that India would take the opportunity to reflect on Pakistan’s approach\nto address the issue and allow visit of the group, which she said was “not anti-India\nor pro-Pakistan, but pro-human rights”.\nAbrahams, who led a delegation of British MPs in a meeting with the Foreign Minister here, stressed that international community needed to take the issue on priority and\n“make sure that human rights are not negotiable, regardless of religion, ethnicity,\nage and gender”.\nShe said the Resolutions of UN Security Council were still in place and relevant\nfor the current Kashmir situation.\nTo a question on UK’s response on looming threat of genocide in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, she said the independent group did not represent the British government and could not speak on its behalf. However, she said the group had host of ways to draw attention to the relevant authorities in this regard.\n“We as parliamentarians will lobby our governments towards the issue of\ngeo-political significance as two nuclear powers [Pakistan and India] could\ncome to loggerheads with each other,” she said.\nDebbie Abrahams termed Kashmir a ‘longest running dispute’ which escalated\nafter India’s action of revoking the Valley’s special status on August 5 last year.\nShe mentioned the commitment of Pakistan government to resolve the issue,\ncontrary to India’s attitude of not allowing international observers to monitor the\nsituation.\nDeputy chair of All Parties Kashmir Group MP Imran Hussain said the Kashmir issue was\nnot limited as a bilateral matter between Pakistan and India, but became a human rights issue that needed serious attention by the world community.\nHe said if India had nothing to hide about the situation in Kashmir, the independent\ngroup would have been allowed to visit the Occupied valley.\nHe termed India’s Public Safety Act as “draconian and illegal”, saying it was the moral\nduty of the world not to shy away from the issue”.\n“We must help to assist and resolve the issue and the Indian government should realize about its irresponsible role,” he added.\nHe said lockdown in Occupied Kashmir had made situation cumbersome for innocent civilians who could not even contact their relatives on other side of the Valley.\nHussain said the UN Human Rights chief would also soon visit Pakistan.\nForeign Minister Qureshi said India had revealed its sham face of secularism and democracy by denying visit of an independent foreign group on Kashmir.\nHe mentioned that All Parties Group of British parliamentarians presented a\ncredible report on Kashmir situation in 2018, highlighting the ongoing atrocities\nby Indian security forces.\nHe expressed hope that House of Commons, European parliament and US\nCongress would raise voice, similar to Pakistan where the parliament twice\npassed unanimous resolutions on Kashmir.\n“The world’s parliaments should raise voice and back the international human\nrights organizations speaking on Kashmir,” he said.\nHe expressed fear that the disputed area could become a nuclear flashpoint\nwith high prospects of making a global impact.\nTo a question on slow progress on Kashmir’s resolution, he said the\ngovernment had revived the issue which was put on back-burner for\nseveral years.\n“After 54 years, we have taken up the issue at UN Security Council and thus,\na beginning has been made,” he said, adding that the recent statement of UN\nSecretary General Antonio Guterres about UNSC Resolutions of being still\nrelevant today was a great endorsement of Pakistan’s stance.\nQureshi dismissed a statement by Indian External Affairs Minister S.\nJaishankar who said only one of the two democracies would decide about\nthe fate of Kashmir, saying that decision by the “so-called democracy” had\nalready been taken on August 5 which was rejected by Kashmiris.\n“Today, a huge segment of population including Muslims and other minorities\ncall the Citizenship Amendment Act a folly of India,” he said.",
