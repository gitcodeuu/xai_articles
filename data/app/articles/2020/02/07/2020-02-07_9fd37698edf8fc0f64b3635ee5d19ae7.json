It has left everyone’s heart deeply pained and wounded.”\nShe said it was a challenging task to transform a thought into action and our artists had aptly done their job in presenting it as a peace message.\n“These photos show the unprecedented human rights violations at the hands of Indian forces that no civilized society and group could allow such brutalities in the world,” the SAPM noted.\nThe artists, she said, had painted the Mujahideens (freedom fighters)’s great efforts and struggle against Indian occupation and on the other hand the beautiful flowers blooming in the occupied valley deserved true appreciation.\nThe SAPM said India had turned IOJ&K into a military cantonment and turned it into a dumping site for gunpowder.\nShe further said that Prime Minister Imran Khan had repeatedly highlighted Kashmir issue at global forums, as its ambassador and advocate.\n“Prime Minister Imran Khan has warned Prime Minister Modi in Mirpur that if India launched any misadventure against Pakistan it would be her last mistake,” she added.\nDr Firdous said if India imposed a war on Pakistan then it would not remain confined to Pakistan and Kashmir rather we would hoist the flags of Pakistan and Kashmir in Delhi.\n“We demand India to quickly lift curfew from the IOJ&K and give Kashmiris their just right to self-determination as per the UN resolutions. Indian forces will have to leave IOJ&K. Kashmiris should decide their fate as their determination for Pakistan has remained unchanged after 71 years of oppression.\nCommenting on the forthcoming visit of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Pakistan, she said President Erdogan had always supported Pakistan on Kashmir issue and highlighted the Indian atrocities in IOJ&K at every forum including Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Both the leaders had the vision to unite Muslim Ummah that was a greater challenge for us, she added.\nDr Firdous said his visit would help further strengthen the ties between Turkey and Pakistan.",
