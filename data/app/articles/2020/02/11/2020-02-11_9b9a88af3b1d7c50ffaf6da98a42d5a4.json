  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 11 (APP):President Dr Arif Alvi on Tuesday said fake news always had a strong hidden agenda of giving rise to conflicts among nations and within societies, and stressed awareness at public level was vital to ensure responsible and cautious use of social media.\nAddressing at International Conference on Media and Conflict at Convention\nCentre, the president said apart from positive aspects of social media, it was\nbeing used as a modern tool of propaganda and fake news, which required\na constant vigilance.\nPresident Alvi pointed out that today’s media around the world, had adopted\nan approach of highlighting negatives to create sensationalism and market\ntheir news products.\nHe mentioned that fake news could have three faces – misinformation based\non wrong information, disinformation with addition of incorrect content and\nmalinformation with cooked news.\nHe said a number of Pakistani media outlets also had a tendency to twist\nfacts and expressed dissatisfaction for himself, being quoted out-of-context\nseveral times in interviews and news.\nPresident Alvi said most wars in the world were imposed on the basis of\nmisinformation to advance specific agendas, terming such countries and\nstakeholders as ‘pickpockets of modern era’.\nFor example, the western media often gives prominence to news items\nagainst Islam which has resulted in hatred and insecurity among Muslim\ncommunity, he added.\nThe president recalled that in the guise of justifying attack on Iraq in 90s, a series of fake news about ‘weapons of mass destruction’ was launched\nwhich resulted in loss of millions of lives and inflicted huge damage to\nproperty.\nThe domino effect continued in Iraq, Iran, Libya and Syria, for which the\nentire humanity paid a heavy price, he added.\nPresident Alvi regretted that in today’s world, not morality but the volume\nof trade had become the new criteria for justice.\nHe said humans as part of their genetic disposition, had the ability to\nregister good or bad news and quoted a book ‘Factfulness’ by Hans\nRosling which focused that vast majority of human beings were wrong\nabout the state of the world.\nPresident Alvi urged upon the nation to not to fall prey to vicious cycle\nof misinformation which was also strictly prohibited as per Islamic\nteachings.\nHe said fake news had the inherent capacity to severely damage families\nand societies and quoted a few verses from Quran’s Surahs Nisa and\nAl-Hujurat that provided a guidance on not propagating wrong information.\nHe said fake news had a strong influence on the last elections in Untied\nStates and feared that in Pakistan’s next election in 2023, social media\ncould be used in exploiting public opinion through fake imagery and news.",
