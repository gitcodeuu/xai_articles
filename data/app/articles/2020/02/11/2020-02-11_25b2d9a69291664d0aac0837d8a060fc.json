Similarly, the cost of residence in Makkah and fare of buses and trains have also gone up, he added.\nHe said the government reimbursed Rs5.50 billion to the pilgrims last year and efforts were being made to minimize the burden on intending pilgrims this year.\nHe said around 22,000 Pakistanis pilgrims benefited from Road to Makkah project in Islamabad last year and this year talks were underway to extend it to Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi and Quetta.\nHe said 70-year old and above pilgrims would be sent without balloting this year adding 1,000 quota was also allocated for overseas Pakistanis who wished to perform Hajj with their relatives.\nA joint working office would be set up with Saudi Hajj Ministry for prompt redressal of pilgrims issues.\nHe said direct flights from Quetta to Jaddah and Madina would also be operated this year while temporary Hajji camp for pilgrims of Gilgit-Baltistan would be established for their convenience.\nThe minister said biometric and mobile biometric centres would also be set up on the recommendations of the parliamentarians in far flung areas of the country to facilitate the intending pilgrims.",
