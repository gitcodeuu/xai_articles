The CM asserted the PDM was a mixture of rejected elements having no agenda for people.\nHe said that 11 opposition parties could never compete with an honest and trustworthy leader like Imran Khan.\nHe said holding public meetings would be enmity with the people as the corona situation was becoming serious.\nThe intransigence of the PDM had put the lives of the people at stake because this bandit brigade had no pain for the masses, he remarked.\nThe CM maintained the opposition had proved that its politics was not based on any ideology or principle. The irresponsible behaviour of the opposition was deplorable as the spread of corona had been increased due to public meetings.\nThe anarchistic politics of the PDM had been buried as the nation had rejected the negative narrative of this cabal, concluded the CM.",
