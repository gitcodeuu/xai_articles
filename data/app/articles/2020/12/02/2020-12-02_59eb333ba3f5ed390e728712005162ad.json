She proposed to move a joint resolution from the platform of the YPF to this effect.\nUzma Riaz, MNA, General Secretary YPF, thanked PILDAT for arranging an informative briefing session and termed the session as extremely informative.\nShe said that YPF members required more and more informed capability-building sessions, and hoped that such sessions would also be conducted in person in the future as the coronavirus pandemic eases.\nAmong others, the session was attended by Dr.Shazia Sobia Aslam, MNA (PPPP), Wajiha Akram, MNA (PTI), Romina Khursheed Aalam, MNA (PML-N) and Shahid Ahmed, MNA, (PTI).",
