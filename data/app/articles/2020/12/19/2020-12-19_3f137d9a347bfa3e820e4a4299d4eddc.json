  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 19 (APP): Pakistan on Saturday summoned the Indian Chargé d’Affaires to Foreign Office for registering strong protest at the deliberate targeting of Observers belonging to the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP).\nThe UN Observers were on their way to Polas village in Azad Jammu and Kashmir to meet the victims of the Indian ceasefire violations in Chirikot Sector of the Line of Control (LOC).\n“Both the Observers present in the vehicle thankfully remained unharmed and were safely rescued and evacuated to Rawalakot by the Pakistan Army. However, their vehicle sustained damage,” Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.\nHe said the attack was unambiguously premeditated as the UN vehicles were clearly recognizable even from long distances due to their distinctive marking and blue flag.\nIndian Army resorted to unprovoked fire in Chirikot Sector of #LOC. Indian troops deliberately targeted a United Nations vehicle with 2 Military Observers on board, enroute to interact with CFV victims in Polas Village in Chirikot Sector.
