She said that the government would soon establish a Revenue Academy at Lahore for the training of the Revenue staff soon.\nShe said that the Sharif brothers always supported qabza mafia during their tenure.\nShe said that the Board of Revenue Punjab and Federal Board of Revenue were sharing their data with each other for giving relief to the public under a data-sharing agreement.\nShe said that the system of properties’ registration had been computerised in 100 tehsils of Punjab, as the provincial government had started work for printing and upgrading the ‘Jama Bandi’.\nDr Firdous said that 140,000 acres of land had yet been retrieved from the qabza mafia across Punjab during the last two years by the government. The worth of the retrieved land was Rs 1000 billion, she added.\nShe said that the land transfer procedure had been made easy at banks for farmers, enabling them to get the ‘Fard’ of their lands easily under the ‘One Window Operation’, to get agricultural loans as well.\nDr Firdous said that 23 banks had been given access to the land revenue records in Punjab for the first time. She said the e-stamping was helping a lot in checking fake stamp papers besides giving 80 per cent additional income to the government under the stamp duty category as well.\nThe Revenue department was issuing online ‘Fard’ for registration of properties. She said the government was also introducing a system for payment of mutation fee through an android app as well.\nShe said that the Revenue Department had also established special counters in 14 embassies and consulates in four countries (America, UK, Saudi Arabia and UAE ) for facilitating the overseas Pakistanis there.
