Even their sports people. Every child is a terrorist over there. Every child is a terrorist. You are dealing with a terrorist entity.”\n“In the context of these criticisms, the presenter [Goswami], addressing Pakistan and/or Pakistani people, said: We make scientists, you make terrorists.”\nOfcom also mentioned comments made by one of the guests identified as “General Sinha”, who referred to people of Pakistan as “beggars” and threatened military attack on the country.\nOfcom noted that the content of the programme was “potentially offensive and was not sufficiently justified by the context”. It added that the comments made were “expressions of hatred based on intolerance of Pakistani people based on their nationality alone” and promoted and justified intolerance towards Pakistani people among viewers.\nIt also took note of the use of the term “Paki”, which it said was a racist word and unacceptable to the audience of UK.",
