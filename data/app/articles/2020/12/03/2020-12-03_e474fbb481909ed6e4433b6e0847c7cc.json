This is another significant step forward,” he said.\nReferring to the recent visit of Chinese State Councilor and Minister of Defence, General Wei Fenghe , he said, it was part of high-level engagement with China.\nHe said the visit was aimed at further solidifying and expanding Pakistan-China cooperation, particularly in the fields of defense and security.\nDuring the visit, General Wei called on the Prime Minister and the President and held meetings with the Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chief of Army Staff and an An MoU for enhancement of defence cooperation between both the Armies, was also signed.\nHe referred to the Pakistan’s joining of the Digital Cooperation Organization (DCO) as a founding member and said DCO would offer a platform to promote the global digital agenda in the scientific, health, educational, commercial, social, agricultural, investment and security spheres.\nRecalling the unanimous adoption of Resolution on Jammu and Kashmir reaffirming by the the 47th session of the Council of Foreign Ministers (CFM) of OIC, he said it reaffirmed the OIC’s consistent and principled stance on the dispute.\nThe resolution had rejected the illegal and unilateral actions by India on August 5, 2019 and demanded that India rescind its illegal steps. It also deplored the state-sponsored terrorism and crimes against humanity by Indian occupation forces against the people of IIOJK.\nHe said the Niamey Declaration, adopted at the conclusion of the CFM, also explicitly reiterated “the OIC’s principled position on the Jammu and Kashmir for a peaceful resolution of the dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions.”\nThe spokesperson said the Resolution expressed deep concern at the recent incidents of desecration of the Holy Quran and reprinting of sketches of the Holy Prophet (P.B.U.H.), which hurt sentiments of more than 1.8 billion Muslims around the world, and decided to designate 15th March as the “International Day to Combat Islamophobia” each year.\nHe said India unnerved by its continuing international condemnation has barefacedly raised objection on the OIC Resolution on Jammu and Kashmir.\n“Pakistan strongly rejects the Indian Ministry of External Affairs statement in this regard as untenable and uncalled-for.”\nThe OIC Resolution, he said was yet another forceful repudiation of India’s completely flimsy and legally flawed contention that Jammu and Kashmir is its ‘internal’ matter.\nTe FO Spokesperson said it was further proof that India can neither hide its gross and systemic violations of human rights of the Kashmiri people, nor can it escape international censure of its egregious behavior.\nRather than dismissing the international community’s concerns as reflected in the OIC Resolution, he said, India would be well-advised to stop its state-terrorism in IIOJK and take concrete steps towards resolution of the Jammu & Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people.",
