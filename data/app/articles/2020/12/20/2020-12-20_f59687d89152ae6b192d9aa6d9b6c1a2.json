Some 30 fire tenders had been out of order for the last six months and not yet sent for maintenance, he said.\nThe responsibility of maintaining fire tenders lies with the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation.\nAccording to news reports, the high court issued a notice to the KMC commissioner and directed the corporation to initiate the maintenance work of the 30 out-of-order fire tenders.\nReport by Rafia Haider",
