Pakistan and the people of Jammu and Kashmir want a peaceful political and the diplomatic solution to the issue but India is adamant to resolve it through military means that is a war between the two countries.\nRejecting the bilateral talks with India, Masood said that the question of Kashmir and the UNSC resolutions on Kashmir revolves around the people of Kashmir who are fundamental party to the Kashmir as only they will decide their political future through an UN-sponsored referendum.\nDrawing a comparison between AJK and IIOJK, the president said that the Occupied territory had virtually become a big military garrison and open prison for its inhabitants while the people of AJK enjoying freedom, civil liberties and all fundamental rights and they are struggling for a prosperous life.\nEarlier, addressing a separate webinar chaired by the Tehrike Kashmir UK Chief Fahim Kayani, Sardar Masood Khan appealed to the international community to take notice of the worst human rights violations in IIOJK. He said that in order to stop India from committing genocide in IIOJK; it has become inevitable to raise the issue of Kashmir in every forum of the world.\nTehreek-e-Kashmir UK President, Fahim Kayani, Punjab Governor Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar, British MP Afzal Khan, MP Steve Baker, former Member European Parliament Phil Bunion, Muhammad Yasin and other speakers addressed the event.\nThe speakers called for an immediate halt of human rights violations in IIOJK and pointed out that rights abuses there are a matter of concern and the international community must speak out collectively against it.\nThey said that two senior UN officials have written letters to the Indian government on human rights violations which is a welcome step but now merely drawing attention to the Indian government would not work and India cannot be compelled to end rights violations in IIOJK until the world community takes some decisive action.",
