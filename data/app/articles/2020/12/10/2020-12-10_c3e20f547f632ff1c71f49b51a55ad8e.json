Their suffering has increased manifolds during the global pandemic.\nIn defiance of its obligations under the UN Charter, UNSC resolutions and international law, especially the 4th Geneva Convention, India is seeking to alter the demographic structure of the occupied territory, he added.\nHe said India’s gross and systematic violations of human rights in IIOJK had been comprehensively documented in the two Kashmir reports of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) as well as by the UN Special Procedure Mandate Holders, international civil society, and the media.\nThe spokesperson said the International Human Rights Day was an occasion to reaffirm the resolve to respect and uphold human dignity and to promote the human rights agenda without any distinction or discrimination.\nHe said the UDHR embodied the humanity’s collective ideals of building peaceful, inclusive and just societies. Pakistan is proud of the rich imprints in the document from Pakistan’s representative, Begum Shaista Ikramullah, who was amongst the select group that drafted the UDHR.\nThe spokesperson said as a progressive and democratic state that was mindful of its international commitments and obligations, Pakistan was constructively engaged with various human rights mechanisms under UN auspices and always strived to play a positive role as a bridge-builder across diverse political and regional perspectives at the UN.\n“Nationally, we have instituted wide-ranging people-centric policy measures, which are anchored in the Government’s vision to reshape Pakistan in the image of the State of Madinah established by our Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him),” he said.\nBolstered by its country’s constitution, progressive legislation, administrative reforms, and institution building, the government’s actions were particularly aimed at the disadvantaged by seeking to reduce inequalities and expand access to education, health-care and employment opportunities.\nPoverty alleviation, empowerment of women and youth, achievement of Sustainable Development Goals, ensuring equality of opportunities, and justice for all segments of the society are at the center of Pakistan’s human rights priorities, he remarked.\nHe said Pakistan’s response to COVID-19 has been comprehensive, with a special focus on vulnerable groups. The global pandemic warrants a holistic approach including by ensuring affordable and equitable access to and distribution of COVID vaccine, and increasing fiscal space for developing countries in support of their recovery efforts through debt relief",
