They were suffering systematic and serial violations of their fundamental freedoms.\nGiving an overview of the situation in IIOJK, Qureshi said with the continuing atrocities, including the rape of women, blinding thousands of people by using pallet guns etc, India had turned the valley into the largest prison on the planet where basic amenities and means of communication were not accessible.\nShops and hospitals in the region, he added, were running out of supplies and the political leadership of Kashmir had been placed under house arrest or imprisoned.\nShah Mahmood Qureshi said with its illegal actions, including the unilateral August 5, 2019 revocation of Article 370, India was breaching multiple international human rights instruments to which it was a party.",
