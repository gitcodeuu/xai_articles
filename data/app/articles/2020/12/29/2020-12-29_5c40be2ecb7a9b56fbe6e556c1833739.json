The opposition’s sinister campaign against national institutions was a deep-rooted conspiracy however its perfidious narrative has met its logical end. Meanwhile, the anti-government drive has\nno worth, he continued.\nThe CM emphasised that respect of institutions was binding on all as these were the pride pillars of the State. Meanwhile, the government was working hard to wriggle the country out of the quagmire of the crisis and special attention was paid to provide necessary facilities to the citizens, he held.\nThe government was working hard to bring improvement in the lives of the people and the country has moved forward due to the holistic institutional reforms, he said.\nNothing was more important than public welfare, he further said and regretted that the past governments had ignored the problems of the people adding that the incumbent PTI-led government took solid steps to improve the national economy.\nThe past rulers did nothing for the public, in their respective tenures, and opposition had no agenda other than the protection of looted money, he maintained and regretted the country was left behind due to the menace of corruption.\nThose who looted the kitty had no right to speak about the people, he insisted.\nThe country would have not indebted, had there been no corruption in the past, remarked the CM and stressed the looters will have to be answerable for their deeds.\nElimination of corruption, loot and nepotism was crucial for the development of the country.\nThe CM said the journey of public service will be continued by the PTI as the decisions taken in the larger interest of the country have started yielding positive.",
