  "content": "PESHAWAR, Dec 16 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan Wednesday hinted at early holding of the Senate elections, saying the government was also mulling over to approach the Supreme Court for conducting the same through show of hands.\nConsultations were underway over the legal aspects as the government believed in transparent and fair conduct of the elections, he said while talking to the media here at the Governor House.\nThe prime minister said horse-trading in the Senate elections remained very easy for the governments in past, but he expelled 20 provincial assembly members from the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) over their alleged involvement in the practice.\nReferring to the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), Imran Khan said that there was no threat to the PTI government from the opposition’s gatherings.\nThe opposition had sought a 34-page NRO (National Reconciliation Ordinance), which would not be granted to them, he reiterated.\nThe cases against the opposition leaders, he said, were not filed by the PTI government rather by the past regimes.",
