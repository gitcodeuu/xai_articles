But in reality the 11 parties failed to fill even quarter of the huge public park.\nImran Khan said the PDM won’t be getting an NRO, despite spending huge money, time and effort, to blackmail him for an NRO, just to save their looted wealth.\n“I will never give an NRO”\n“Whatever future plans of further blackmail PDM may have, my message is categorical: There will never be an NRO from my govt no matter what tactics the looters devise.”\nIn a series of tweets, Prime Minister Imran Khan said the Pakistan Democratic Movement, a grouping of eleven opposition parties, spent so much money, time, effort on holding a public gathering, which they claimed would be “historic”.\n“There will never be an NRO from my govt no matter what tactics the looters devise”\nKhan pointed that the alliance displayed “utter callousness by endangering ppl’s [people’s] lives during COVID19 spike – showing the scant regard they have for citizens’ safety & well-being.”\n“All this just to blackmail me into giving them an NRO to save their looted wealth.”\nThe national daily death toll for the past two days has been over 70, with an average of around 3000 fresh coronavirus cases a day. Only on Sunday Lahore reported 36 deaths due to the deadly covid-19 virus.\nLet me once again reiterate: I will never give an NRO. Whatever future plans of further blackmail PDM may have, my message is categorical: There will never be an NRO from my govt no matter what tactics the looters devise.\n— Imran Khan (@ImranKhanPTI) December 13, 2020\nMaryam Nawaz Sharif, daughter of Nawaz Sharif and leader of Pakistan Muslim League, Chairman Peoples Party Bilawal Bhutto and Maulana Fazalur Rehman of JUI-F had made tall claims that Dec 13 would be a day of change.\nThere were claims by opposition leaders that entire Lahore would be out on the roads in protest as members of parliament of the opposition parties would tender resignations, announce date for long march on Islamabad and bring in end to the sitting government of Prime Minister Imran Khan. However the power show turned out to be an embarrassment.\nAbid Sher Ali received flak from PTI supporters after he shared a mammoth gathering at Minar-e-Pakisatan, which proved to be an old photograph of Imran Khan’s historic jalsa in October 2011.\nImran Khan, seemed little bothered by such antics, spent a rare leisurely day relaxing and having a good time with his pet dogs – Sheru and Tiger, at his private Banigala residence.\nHis pictures in casuals were shared on his party’s instagram account @imrankhan.pti and got an immediate positive response from his huge base of followers.\nA post shared by Imran Khan (@imrankhan.pti)\nMeanwhile President Arif Alvi too spent a leisurely holiday trekking the scenic Margalla hills.\nThe president in a message on twitter said he went for a long early morning nature walk and hike at 7 am after Fajr prayers.\n“Along with my grandson Zaafir 17. First, we did trail 5 in the Margallas. Saw deer, monkeys, skunks & birds. Beautiful Pakistan.”\nHe mentioned that the trail was clean, showing that the Pakistanis were becoming more responsible.\n“Makes me proud,” he posted on his twitter handle.\nAfter Fajr @ 7AM I went for a day long nature hike & walk.

Spent a great relaxing day, with Allah’s grace, I am fit,” President Alvi, who is 71 years old said in his tweet.\nContinued my walk almost up to 4 PM. I try to move without protocol to avoid inconveniencing people who are the true owners of Pakistan. In all did almost 20 km and climbed about 600 meters, which is like 182 floors.
