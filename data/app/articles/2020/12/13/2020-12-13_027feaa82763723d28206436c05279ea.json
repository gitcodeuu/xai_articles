Mehmood Achakzai’s speech in Lahore had proved again that PDM’s was pursuing an anti-state agenda, Shahbaz Gill maintained.\nThe SAPM said that the person who had been talking about the patients of teaching hospital had set a show in Lahore to spread COVID-19. They even could not construct a single good hospital in Pakistan during their previous regimes where they could get medical treatment, Gill concluded.",
