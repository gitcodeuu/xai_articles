Whatever future plans of further blackmail PDM may have, my message is categorical: There will never be an NRO from my govt no matter what tactics the looters devise,” he posted.\nNRO-National Reconciliation Ordinance, the controversial piece of legislation was enacted by former president general retired Pervez Musharraf during 2007 to grant amnesty to politicians, political workers and bureaucrats accused of corruption, embezzlement of public money, money laundering, illegal assets etc. It was declared unconstitutional and illegal by the Supreme Court on Dec 16, 2009.\nThe prime minister in related tweet noted that it was pathetic of the PDM’s leadership which had spent so much money, time and efforts by endangering peoples’ lives during Covid 19 spike.\nAll was done to get NRO and save the looted wealth, he added.\n“Pathetic. PDM spent so much money, time, effort & displayed utter callousness by endangering ppl’s (peoples) lives during COVID19 spike – showing the scant regard they have for citizens’ safety & well-being. All this just to blackmail me into giving them an NRO to save their looted wealth” he further tweeted.",
