Tahreek-e-Kashmir UK is actively working to raise the profile of the Kashmir dispute and effectively highlighting the human rights violations being committed by the India occupation forces.\n“The diaspora community must synergize their strengths so that we may positively advocate the Kashmir cause in a fruitful manner”, said President AJK.\nPresident Masood Khan said that the Pakistan-Kashmiri diaspora, which has grown in numbers all over the world, works closely with their representatives and over the years, their strengths have increased manifold.\nFaheem Kiani also congratulated the AJK President for representing the Kashmiri people and delivering his statement to the full-house of the 47th OIC-CFM conference and successfully adoption of a Kashmir resolution.\nHe termed this as a major diplomatic success for the people of Jammu and Kashmir, and further solidifying the unwavering support of the OIC member states to the just cause of the people of Kashmir.\nKiani assured the President during the meeting that his organization will continue to garner support for the Kashmiris’ just right to self-determination and will reach out to influential Parliamentarians, opinion makers and the British civil society. He informed that the diaspora community all over Europe will be effectively mobilized to hold conferences, seminars and rallies in this connection.\nSardar Masood Khan said that the growing interest of British MPs belonging to all major parties is a visible indication of the efforts of the diaspora community in mobilizing and sensitizing their representatives on the Kashmir dispute.",
