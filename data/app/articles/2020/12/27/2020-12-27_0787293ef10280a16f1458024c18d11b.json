Prime Minister Imran Khan, on several occasions, has reiterated his calls for reduction in violence leading to ceasefire, he added.\nHe emphasized that it was important to underline the need for Afghan government to take pro-active measures to fulfill its responsibility for internal security, law and order and protection of Afghan lives.\n“Pakistan stands ready to extend all possible cooperation in the area of security and effective border management through effective institutional collaboration,” he remarked.\nHe said recently, the two countries had witnessed positive trajectory in bilateral relations with significant progress on important bilateral matters including revision of Afghanistan–Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) and commencement of negotiations on PTA.\nHigh level leadership contacts and bilateral visits including that of the prime minister of Pakistan were a manifestation of further strengthening of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations.\nThe two sides must continue to build on the momentum and prevent domestic and regional detractors from their subversive designs.\nHe said Pakistan desired and continued to support a peaceful, stable, united, independent, democratic, sovereign and prosperous Afghanistan.\n“It is important that Afghans should seize this historic opportunity for reaching an inclusive, broad-based and comprehensive political settlement to bring an end to the decades-long internal conflict in Afghanistan,” the spokesperson added.",
