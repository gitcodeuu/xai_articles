  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 03 (APP): Ali Muhammad Khan Thursday said Nawaz Sharif should respect the court decision, return to Pakistan and appear before the court as it was his moral, legal and political obligation.\nSpeaking along with Parliamentary Secretary for Railways Farrukh Habib here outside the Election Commission, he said Shehbaz Sharif was the guarantor of Nawaz Sharif and the court would decide about him too.\nHe said Nawaz Sharif should either get his medical treatment or return to the country as he could not indefinitely stay out of the country.\nNawaz Sharif did not give details of his medical treatment to the court, he noted.\nThe minister said Shehbaz Sharif visited Karachi and talked with Asif Ali Zardari about how to save their politics and wealth.\nThe opposition parties wanted to bury the institution of National Accountability Bureau (NAB), he observed.\nHe said the parties of status quo did not want change in the country and they wanted to rule the country in turns.\nHe said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had provided details of its audited accounts and foreign funding to the Election Commission of Pakistan.\nIn January 2020, PTI filed a petition asking that all political parties should submit details of their accounts as mandated by the constitution and Political Parties Act, he said.\nHe said Pakistan Muslim League (N), Pakistan Peoples Party, Awami National Party, Jamiat Ulema Islam and others should also submit their account details to the Election Commission.\nAt present many parties did not bother to file their account details or their details were less than required, he added.\nAli Muhammad said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was a federal party and took mandate from all parts of Pakistan and it was respecting the constitution and other parties should also do the same.\nParliamentary Secretary for Railways Farrukh Habib said it might be possible that Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League (N) used the party accounts for money laundering.\nHe said it was the requirement of Financial Action Task Force (FATF) that financial matters should be transparent and accountability laws should be made to act against the violators.\nHe said the Election Commission should look into the accounts of all the parties from the year 2014 to 2018.\nHe said opposition parties wanted change in the accountability law to save themselves from the investigation of NAB.\nHe alleged that opposition parties were involved in money laundering and fake accounts.\nThese parties did not care if Pakistan got into the black list of FATF, he added.\nHe said no opposition in the world would blackmail the government on issues of national security.\nThe opposition was exposed as when Karachi sank after rains, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were planning for an “NRO” and to stop passage of FATF related legislation to protect their looted wealth, he concluded.",
