Pakistan has been and will continue supporting the Afghan peace process,” he said.\nHe said the Afghan Peace Process had reached a critical stage with the US-Taliban Peace Agreement providing a historic opportunity, which the Afghan leaders must seize.\nAs for withdrawal of foreign troops, he said there existed an agreement between Taliban and the US, requiring steps for its implementation in letter and spirit.\nOn Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the Spokesperson said Pakistan had implemented the Action Plan since 2018 and made significant progress in this regard.\n“Our entire Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism regime has been revamped in compliance of the Action Plan to bring it to the international standards set by FATF,” he said.\nHe said, “The substantial progress made by Pakistan under a huge national effort includes steps in legislative, regulatory and operational domains.”\nThe FO Spokesperson mentioned that FATF had also acknowledged Pakistan’s political commitment and the progress made in a number of areas in the Action Plan.\nWe are committed to and moving towards completion of the FATF Action Plan, he added.",
