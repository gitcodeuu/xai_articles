Unfortunately, the durable resolution of all the said problems always faced neglect in the past, he added.\nImran Khan said the recent rains had not only exposed the loopholes in the administrative structure but also made the people suffer badly; however, the Federal Government was alive to the situation.\nIt was need of the hour to devolve the control of water supply schemes, sewerage treatment and disposal, solid waste management and building control authority to a fully empowered administrator or local government, he added.",
