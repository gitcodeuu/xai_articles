Such sympathy towards the poor would become a national culture casting positive impact on the future generation, he added.\nWhile highlighting Pakistan’s high moral values of hosting millions of refuges and generous support towards the countrymen during earthquake and floods, the president said many countries had come up to the conclusion that the world must learn lesson from Pakistan’s COVID-19 success story.\nHe eulogized the unprecedented discipline showed by the people during the pandemic, particularly after the government allowed Tarawih prayer during Holy Ramzan which helped contained the spread of coronavirus.\nThis was the first outdoor event addressed by the president after COVID-19, with the moderator repeatedly urging the audience to observe social distancing and wear masks, also placed at the entrance.\nThe president, who earlier distributed awards among the nominees, urged the business community to adopt honesty as their basic characteristic which should also become a symbol of Muslim traders across the globe.\nHe viewed that the strong institutions and long term political decisions were a must for stable economy.\nHe also called for branding of Pakistan’s products to promote the Made in Pakistan brand globally.\nHe said putting to rest the notions of any recession or bankruptcy, the people were recognizing the business and incentive-laden policies of the incumbent government which had also been manifested by the Pakistan Stock Exchange which emerged as one of best performing stock exchange in the region.\nIn his address, Commerce Advisor Abdul Razzak Dawood said having averted the feared default, Pakistan’s economy had made as successful comeback with shrinking current account deficit and appreciating local currency.\nHe reiterated the government’s resolve to make Pakistan as export-led economy by promoting the Made in Pakistan brand. He hoped that considering the ongoing measures by the government, Pakistan’s ranking in ease of doing business would further improve in the future.\nThe advisor said the government was striving hard to remove all hurdles from local government level to top to bring ease for the businesses.\nEarlier, President ICCI Muhammad Ahmed Waheed highlighted the Chamber’s contribution to support the national economy as well as making the country green and pollution free.\nWhile lauding the construction package announced by Prime Minister Imran Khan, he said it would do miracle to turn around the economy. He also assured the support of business community to address the woes of people of Karachi suffering after heavy rains.",
