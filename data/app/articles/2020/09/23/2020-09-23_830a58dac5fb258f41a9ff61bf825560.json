The parents are also buying masks and sanitizers in bulk for their children keeping in view the risks of increasing COVID-19 cases in the coming days.\nAsim Mehmood, a shopkeeper said the increased sale of stationary items, text books, school bags, water bottles and uniforms after reopening of the educational institutions will cover up the loss inflicted during the six month lockdown period.\nMajority of the customers were trying to buy all the stuff at a time so that they don’t have to visit the shop again and again keeping in view their safety while some are preferring to buy the most essential things thinking of chances of another wave of the pandemic in Winter season that can led to closure of institutions again, he said.\nAftab Shah, another retailer in Karachi Company said they have deployed more salesmen to deal with the large number of customers visiting the stores.\nHe said that his team is complying with the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) of Covid-19 through ensuring wearing of masks but the customers avoid maintaining distance now. “We have also restricted entry of those not wearing face masks”.\nThe reopening of educational institutions has been welcomed by the parents who were faced with the difficulties during managing online classes for their children especially the younger ones.\nShagufta Ahsan, a mother of two children said, although it is a good decision to reopen the school but financially burdened the parents who have to submit the admission fee, purchase the overpriced stationary, textbooks, uniforms and winter accessories too.\nThe private schools are taking full advantage of the situation and even asked the parents to buy the specially designed face mask for the children from their designated shop, she said.",
