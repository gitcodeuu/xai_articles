A Hindu member had been assigned the responsibilities of chairman of the commission for promptly resolving minority issues.\nThe functions of NCM would be improved and refined further by an act of Parliament.\nQadri said the country has almost controlled the spread of COVID-19 owing to the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nEuropean Union (EU) ambassador in Pakistan Androulla Kaminara said EU supports Pakistan’s earnest endeavours of promoting Interfaith Harmony.\nThe Kartarpur corridor project was best example of promoting fraternity among the minorities communities.",
