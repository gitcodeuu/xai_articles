He said that the best mechanism would include chalking out an inclusive plan to engage community leaders, social activists and above all the religious clerics to help guide the general public.\nThe President invited the UNFPA Country Representative to visit AJK and also set their office up in Muzaffarabad.  He assured that the Government of AJK, its people, the civil society, social and community leaders will fully cooperate in this regard.
