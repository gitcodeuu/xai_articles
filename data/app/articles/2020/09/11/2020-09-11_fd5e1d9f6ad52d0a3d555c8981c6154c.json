The building was constructed without approval of the Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA). The collapse of the building caused four lives and injured seven others, he said.\nThe chief minister directed the commissioner to identify other vulnerable buildings in the area and get them vacated.\nIt was pointed out that the Allahwala Town was a private society and had no drainage system. The water was stagnant in the area which might have collapsed the building.\nThe commissioner said that there were 194 drainage lines choked in the city, of them 154 have been restored, therefore not only overflow of gutters has come to an end in most of the areas but rain water has also been disposed of, except a few areas including Surjani and some villages of Malir.\nThe CM was told that patch work of some of the dilapidated roads have been started.\nThe Works & Services department has yet to start repair of major roads of district Central for which the chief minister directed chief secretary to mobilize the works department at the earliest.\nAdministrator KMC Iftikhar Shahalwani told the chief minister that he was working hard to serve the city.\nAt this the chief minister Sindh said that he wanted to make this neat and clean for which the KMC, DMCs and the Solid Waste Management Board have to work together.",
