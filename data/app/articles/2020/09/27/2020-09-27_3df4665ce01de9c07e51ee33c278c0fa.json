The provincial governments had been exploring new sites and focusing on their development, he added.\nThe officer said the government was fully cognizant of the situation, erupted after the pandemic that was why it had evolved a comprehensive plan for holistic promotion of the country tourism, encompassing leisure, religious, adventure, coastal and others at the international level by capturing digital market.\nThe programme would be rolled out soon to pave the way for promoting the country as a best tourist destination abroad.\nUnder the project , he said an initiative- Brand Pakistan- had been prepared to introduce the country as a customized brand across the globe. An exclusive tourism portal was also in final stages that meant to promote the country’s tourist attractions across the world through virtual galleries, videos and documentaries.
