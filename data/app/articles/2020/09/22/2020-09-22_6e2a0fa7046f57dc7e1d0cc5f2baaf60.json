Both the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples’ Party had leveled rigging allegations on each others in the past, he added.\nHe claimed the PPP had done massive rigging in Sindh during the general election 2018 and it was now leveling baseless allegations of rigging against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government.\nAli Amin Gandapur said the leadership of PPP and PML-N were not sincere and loyal with the country and both were doing politics to save their corruption and halt accountability process against them.\nHe said Nawaz Sharif, Shehbaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were convicted in many corruption cases.\nReplying to a question, he said the civil and military leadership are on same page on national security issues including provincial status of GB.",
