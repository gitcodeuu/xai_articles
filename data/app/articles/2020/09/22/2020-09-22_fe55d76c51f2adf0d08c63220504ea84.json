This is a clear display of the UN’s dereliction from its core obligations of maintaining global peace”, AJK President office told media on Tuesday.\nHe said that with the support of friendly countries Pakistan can table resolutions in the Third, Fourth and Sixth Committees of the UNGA, highlighting in it Kashmiris right to self-determination, decolonization and the illegal dimensions of India’s actions, respectively.\n“The President expressed these remarks while speaking to a Kashmir webinar hosted by the UK-based NGO – the Jammu and Kashmir Self-Determination Movement International.\nThe event was chaired by Debbie Abrahams MP All Parties Kashmir Parliamentary Group in the British Parliament.\nThe AJK President said that the situation in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJK) is very dire and is deteriorating every day.\nHe added that extrajudicial killing, custodial killings and arbitrary arrest are increasing exponentially and there are countless instances of enforced disappearances, sexual molestations and violence against women.\n“Thousands of young men including children are hoarded into concentration camps where they are being tortured”, he said.\nThe Indian Government is carrying out genocide and ethnic cleansing in the occupied territory.\nThis, he said has been mentioned by the US-based Genocide Watch.\nNot only this, India continues to carry out frequent ceasefire violations along the Line of Control, which is wreaking havoc on the innocent civilians living in AJK.\nHe also warned of the inexorable and rapid transfer of population taking place in IOJK.\n“Since April 2020, 1.7 million illegal domiciles have been granted to Hindu Indian citizens.\nIndia is, in fact, preparing draconian measures, calling it ‘the final solution’.\nThey are replicating the playbook of the Nazi’s and Israeli’s by creating new settlements”, he said.\nAfter August 5, 2019, he said, the international media and global community had actively raised the issue of Kashmir and castigated India for its unilateral actions. Unfortunately, the attention has dwindled due to other global issues that stole the limelight, he said. Social Media is considerable active on Kashmir and we continue to get posts and footage of countless human right violations being committed in IOJK.\nThe President said that we need to create a critical mass and critical pitch for the Kashmir issue in order to make Kashmir a global movement.

Recently 14 US congress members have written to President Donald Trump to declare India as a country of particular concern in regards to religious freedom.\nMasood Khan urged exploring space for law-fare and consulting the international Law Commission for setting special tribunals on Kashmir.

He said that bilateral talks with India have yielded no concrete results. “This matter is a trilateral issue and the Kashmiris are an integral part of the dispute. No talks would be successful without the inclusion of Kashmiris”, maintained Masood Khan.\nPresident Khan said that the Human Rights Council has yet to act on the advice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights for sending an impartial Commission of Inquiry to Jammu and Kashmir. He said that unlike India, both Pakistan and AJK would welcome the Commission to Azad Kashmir.",
