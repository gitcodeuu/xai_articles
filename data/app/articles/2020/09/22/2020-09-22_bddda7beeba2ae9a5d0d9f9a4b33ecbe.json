The opposition’s APC ended in fiasco and the opposition parties totally ignored the national interests, he added.\nThe CM warned that the looters could not hoodwink people through their APC drama as the citizens were fully aware of the corrupt elements. The rejected elements could not deceive the people now, he added. The opposition parties were, in fact, trying to obstruct the national development in the country.\nUsman Buzdar lamented the negative role played by the opposition and observed that the APC drama exposed them again.\nAbdul Aleem Khan said that the Food Department was ensuring supply of flour and different steps were being taken to ensure its availability at the notified rates.
