Similarly, Export Processing Zones were being established to increase exports from Pakistan, a press release quoted him as saying.\nPresident AMEAA (Americas, Middle East, Africa and Asia) of the Ontex Group Armando Amselem briefed the ambassador about the company’s existing investment portfolio in Pakistan.\nAmselem also shared his company’s plans to enhance its production facility by investing a further 10 million Euros.\nOntex is a leading manufacturer of disposable hygiene products for children and adults, cosmetic products and medical gloves with production facility in Karachi.
