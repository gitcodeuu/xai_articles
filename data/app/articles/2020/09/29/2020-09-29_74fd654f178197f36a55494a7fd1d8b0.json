Since Stages 3 and 4 are more common in Pakistan, therefore early detection is important, she stressed.\nShe advised all women over 40 to undergo screening and mammography and also perform regular self-palpation to locate any unfamiliar nodule or lump.\nShe suggested intake of balanced diet to minimize breast cancer risks and adopt healthy lifestyle.\nFocal person National Breast Cancer Awareness Campaign, Ministry of National Health Dr Ayesha Isani Majeed said the Federal Breast Cancer Screening Centre at Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) was providing free of cost walk-in facility of mammography, besides oncology services under one roof.\nDuring the interactive session, the president and first lady responded to the queries of journalists and also listened to their suggestions regarding the breast cancer awareness campaign through the platform of media.",
