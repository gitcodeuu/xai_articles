India, ostensibly, is one of these nations that has emerged as the biggest threat to peace”.\nCiting the rising tide of Hindu Nationalism, racism and state violence within the Indian society, he said that under Modi’s government India has become insecure and unsafe for minorities especially Muslims and Christians”, he said.\nVoicing his concern over India’s expansionist designs in the Kashmir region, he said that a new regime of laws enforced meant to change the demography of the state has further aggravated the volatile situation and the vulnerability of the marginalized Kashmiri masses, who were fighting for their legitimate cause guaranteed to them by the international community as well as the leadership of India and Pakistan.\nAs the world observes the Peace Day today, the KIIR chairman said, it was high time for the world to stand up to secure and safeguard rights of the marginalized groups, communities and nations like Kashmir who are reeling under tyrannical clutches of the Indian",
