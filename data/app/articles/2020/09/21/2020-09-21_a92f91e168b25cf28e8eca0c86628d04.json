  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 21 (APP): The World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) on Monday signed a new collaborative framework which will accelerate joint public health efforts that put the most marginalized and vulnerable populations first.\nNew partnership calls for key actions in universal health coverage, mental health, emergencies and nutrition,said a press release issued here.\nThe new Strategic Collaboration Framework builds on a robust 70-year collaboration between the two organizations, and prioritizes four strategic areas for immediate attention and action at all levels of the organizations.\nUniversal health coverage, through a primary health care and health systems approach; mental health and psychosocial well-being and development; public health emergencies; and maternal and child nutrition.\nAdditionally, the two organizations signed a new Joint Programme on Mental\nHealth and Psychosocial Well-being and Development of Children and\nAdolescents.\nThis 10-year collaborative effort will promote mental health and\npsychosocial well-being and development, increase access to care for mental\nhealth conditions, and reduce suffering and enhance quality of life among\nchildren and adolescents, and their caregivers.\n“The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed huge gaps in accessing health, wellbeing\nand nutrition services among children and vulnerable populations,” said\nHenrietta Fore, UNICEF Executive Director.\n“There has never been a more urgent need to work together. This new framework will help us strengthen health and food systems, and invest in mental health and psychosocial\nsupport in every country in the world.”\nFor more than 70 years, WHO and UNICEF have worked together worldwide\nto ensure children survive and thrive, and benefit from a safe and clean\nenvironment.\nThe two organizations collaborated to provide high-impact\nhealth, immunization, nutrition, HIV and early child development\ninterventions, as well as safe water and sanitation services in every region of\nthe world, including in fragile and conflict settings.\n“At the heart of our work with UNICEF is seeing that every child not only\nsurvives but ultimately thrives and transforms their communities and future\ngenerations,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO DirectorGeneral.\n“With great appreciation and respect for our unique and complementary roles, we stand together in our commitment to achieve health for all.\nAs this pandemic demonstrates, no-one is safe until everyone is safe.”\nToday, WHO and UNICEF continue to work together to stop the COVID-19\npandemic and ensure that every woman and every child have access to the\nessential health services they need, including immunizations and health\ncheck-ups.\nThe two organizations are also working together to support countries to\nintroduce and deliver COVID-19 vaccines under the vaccines pillar of the\n“Access to COVID-19 Tools – Accelerator” (ACT-A) initiative, along with Gavi,\nCEPI and global immunization partners.\nAdditionally, the organizations are strengthening health systems through\nprimary health care, as agreed in the Declaration of Astana, and the UN\nHigh-level declaration on UHC, in order to accelerate achievement of\nuniversal health coverage and Sustainable Development Goal 3 targets by\n2030.",
