  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 16 (APP):Pakistan on Wednesday strongly condemned the extra-judicial killing of 23-year-old Irfan Ahmad Dar, a shopkeeper from Sopore region of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), picked up from his home and mercilessly tortured to death in police custody.\nMore than three hundred innocent Kashmiris, including women and children, had been martyred by the Indian occupation forces in fake encounters, so-called “cordon and search” operations, and other instances of use of brutal force including pellet guns during the last one year, Foreign Office spokesperson said in a statement.\nHe said India’s inhuman methods to subjugate the Kashmiri people through killings, torture, forced disappearances and incarcerations had failed in the past and would not succeed in future.\nThe perpetuation of India’s state-terrorism could not break the will of the Kashmiris or quell their efforts to secure their inalienable right to self-determination as enshrined in the relevant United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions and international law.\nThe spokesperson urged the international community to take immediate cognizance of the worsening human rights situation in the IIOJK and hold India accountable for its serious crimes against the Kashmiri people.\nIndia must be made to comply with its international legal obligations and respect fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people, including the foremost right to life, he added.\nHe said it was also the collective responsibility of the world community, including the United Nations, to work for peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and international law for durable peace and stability in South Asia.",
