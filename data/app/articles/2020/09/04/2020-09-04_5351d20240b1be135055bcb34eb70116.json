Shafqat was satisfied on the overall Coronavirus related indicators, stating that the number of cases had been declined.\nHe said, “the pandemic had badly affected the education of students. We will review the educational loss of students during the last six months in consultation with the provinces. The students’ learning level will be checked and the schools will be advised in that regard”, he added.\nHe urged the students to work hard to cover their educational loss. He hoped that by next year the schools would work in normal routine.\n“We were well aware about the financial loss of private sectors especially the lower grade schools”, he added.\nThe Education Minister stressed to ensure implementation on the Standard Operation Procedures (SOPs). He said teachers and head teachers would play vital role in ensuring the implementation on SOPs.",
