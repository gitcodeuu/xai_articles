The APC had remained unsuccessful in the past and would meet the same fate again, he added.\nUsman Buzdar said the government had started development programmes instead of hoodwinking the people through exhibitory projects.\nThe PTI government has been giving attention to the development of the social sector whereas the basic needs of the people were ignored in the past, he concluded.",
