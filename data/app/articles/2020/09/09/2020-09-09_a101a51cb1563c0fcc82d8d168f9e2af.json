However, in Pakistan, he regretted that majority of subsidies were being given to the already stable and sound sectors, besides the wealth generated being diverted to payment of debts.\nHe said there would have been no shortage of resources and burden on common people, had the country started planning 40 years ago to meet its energy energy demands.\n“Today, we are in state of fire-fighting due to lack of planning for finding sustainable solutions to important problems,” he said.\nThe Prime Minister said timely planning by the previous governments could have led to exploration of additional energy resources in the country.\nTo the concerns of provinces regarding their share in divisible pool, he said the federal government could only share from the money whatever it collected through taxes.\nOn electricity generation, Imran Khan thanked the Independent Power Producers (IPPs) for renegotiating their contracts with the government and said the public would be updated about the details of these agreements by the next week.\nHe said Pakistan had been generating cheap hydroelectric electricity for long, however the apathy towards promoting this sector resulted in expensive commodity.\nThe Prime Minister expressed satisfaction over the holding of a national debate on gas sector, which would prove helpful not only important in arriving at conclusions based on expertise, but would also giving correct information to media for further public consumption.\nHe said in absence of information based on knowledgeable debates, the otherwise opinion disseminated through media could involve the risk of creating rifts among the nation on important issues.\n“Healthy and informational debates are the real power of democracy that open vistas of solutions to the problems concerning general public,” he said.\nImran Khan mentioned that the United Kingdom encouraged debate on Brexit within its society with population divided half and half over the matter of leave or remain.\nHe said even the Communist Party of China, though not an electoral democracy, had always been promoting in-depth debates on national issues.\nThe seminar gathered officials and experts on gas sector with group discussions held on issues related to gas sector including supply options, financial sustainability and costs.",
