Therefore, the question doesn’t arise of holding any official function or declaring a holiday on Monday,” a senior official said in a media interview.\nSheikh Mohammad Abdullah as the then prime minister of occupied Jammu and Kashmir had declared July 13 as martyrs’ day in memory of those who revolted against the Dogra rule on July 13, 1931.\nKashmir commemorated the day as Martyrs’ Day and puppet chief minister, ministers and DGPs used to pay tributes at the official programmed across the territory.\nIt was worth mentioning here that on the 13th of July 1931 when the troops of Dogra Maharaja had killed 22 Kashmiris, one after another, who had turned up in thousands outside Central Jail in Srinagar during the court proceedings against one Abdul Qadeer who had asked Kashmiri people to defy the Dogra rule.\nIt was time for Namaz-e-Zuhr when a young man started the call for prayers (Azaan) but was shot dead by the Maharaja’s soldiers. Thus, 22 youth sacrificed their lives till the completion of Azaan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
