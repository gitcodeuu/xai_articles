They will also have to remain in quarantine for 14 days after the conclusion of the pilgrimage. Pilgrims under the age of 65 and who do not suffer from chronic diseases will be allowed to perform the rituals.\nTouching the Kaaba, the holiest site in Islam, will be banned, and a social distancing of a meter and a half between each pilgrim during the rituals, including mass prayers and while in the Kaaba circling area, will be imposed.\nAccess to holy sites at Mina, Muzdalifah and Arafat will be limited to those with Hajj permits starting July 19 until August 2, and wearing masks all the time will be mandatory for both pilgrims and organisers.\nPeople accessing these sites without a permit will be fined 2,666 dollars.
