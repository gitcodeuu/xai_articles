The provision of quality seeds of major crops including cotton, wheat, sugarcane and maize to farmers on subsidized rates could increase the production.\nAgriculture tubewells should be provided power on subsidized rates. Also competent researchers should be deployed in agriculture research institutions for introducing quality seeds. Modern marketing techniques were also most essential for giving sufficient prices to farmer’s products.\nHe said Pakistani farmers were perturbed over the increased cost of production as their profitability had decreased drastically.\nEntrepreneurs should be bound to manufacture pesticides and farm machinery in Pakistan in a given timeframe. “We should ensure total technology of transfer in three to four years before purchasing any product.

International standard institutions should be set up in the country for research so that other country people could emulate us in enhanced production.\nDifficult decisions should have to be made for increasing agriculture production. Subsidy will be provided to farmers on 325,000 tubewells running on electricity while 1.1 million tubewells on diesel should also be provided facilities.\nHe said 70 percent seed of maize comes from abroad. The production of wheat could be increased from 25 million tons to 30 million tons with superior quality seeds. One million tons quality seeds were needed for enhancing wheat production.

Due to low production of wheat this year the country would have to import 1.5 million to 2 million ton wheat.\nRegarding low production of cotton crop in Pakistan he said the use of quality seed with 80 percent germination capacity can enhance production of cotton bales to 12 to 14 million bales from 9 million bales. “We were had produced 12.8 million bales in 1992 and alas currently Pakistan has to import to 4 to 5 million bales from abroad. We can’t run a steel mill while Republic of Korea was exporting 35 million ton of steel due to better management.”\nPakistan’s fruit exports could be enhanced upto $12 billion dollars from current Rs 600 million to $700 million in a period of three to four years.
