More over country’s first Electric Vehicle Policy has been approved and its market incentives are on ground,” he said.\nThe pandemic of COVID-19 made the world realize that the entire world was interconnected where the existence of one without the other was difficult, as the loss of ecosystems and wildlife would result in such contagions affecting mankind, he added.\nAmin Aslam said that the recent Sustainable Development Report 2020 paced Pakistan at 134th place out of 166 countries where its Sustainable Development Index score was 56.2 in 2020 where at regional level it was 67.2.\nHe mentioned that the SDG-13 performance as per the Sustainable Development Report 2020 was not improving rather complimenting other indicators of different SDGs heading in positive direction.\n“Karachi Zero Emission Metro Bus project, Smart Agriculture project, and glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF-II) programme to mitigate risk of glacial inundation through Global Climate Fund (GCF) financing have been placed on ground in just two years that are responsible to achieve the target of SDG-13”, he said.\nHe added that the government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa implemented Billion Tree Tsunami project (BTT) that revived the depleting forest cover from 20 to 26 percent where the global organizations IUCN, FAO, WWF, Bonn Challenge and others had endorsed this development in their reports.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Deputy Resident Representative United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Aliona Niculita congratulated Pakistan for achieving SDG-13 Climate Action and said, “Its encouraging to see Pakistan achieve SGD-13 in hard and challenging circumstances. Pakistan is an example on established SDG framework that is formed and owned by the government.”\nShe added that it required collective efforts and meaningful partnership to achieve SDG targets.\nUNDP Assistant Resident Representative Environment and Climate Change Unit Amanullah Khan also spoke on the achievement whereas Additional Secretary Ministry of Climate Change Joudat Ayaz delivered his welcome remarks.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
