  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 13 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Shibli Faraz on Monday said Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari having no political agenda was frustrated and his press conference was its\nmanifestation.\nIn a video statement in response to Bilawal’s press conference, he\nsaid that the PPP chairman used derogatory language against the prime\nminister and his sister which was highly condemnable.\nShibli Faraz said PM’s sister has nothing to do with politics, and\nshe should not be dragged into politics. Moreover use of this kind of\nlanguage about a woman was a very despicable act, he remarked.\nShibli said that Bilawal should be the last person to accuse Imran\nKhan of corruption as no one called Imran Khan “Mr. 10 percent” .\n“We strongly condemn Bilawal Bhutto’s allegations. Bilawal Bhutto\nshould not say such things. He was either asleep or he is ignorant of\nthe ground realities” the minister maintained.\nHe said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari whose family has confined one big\nparty of the past to Larkana district only has made a joke of himself\nby saying such frivolous things. Bilawal should have\nthought 10 times before accusing Imran Khan of corruption, he added.\nHe asked Bilawal that instead of talking nonsense, he should answer\nthe questions raised about himself and his family.",
