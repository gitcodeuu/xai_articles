Initially, it was assigned a task of assisting the local administrations in carrying out rescue and relief activities across the country.Later, additional tasks were added to their duties including tree plantation drive, locusts’ surveillance and other services that required more human resource.\n“The volunteers of tiger force will set a record by planting one million saplings in a day,” said a statement issued by the SAPM’s office the other day.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
