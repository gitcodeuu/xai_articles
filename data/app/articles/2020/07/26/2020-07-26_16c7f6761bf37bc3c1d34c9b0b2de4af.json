Showing solidarity with each other during the trying times is the responsibility of all of us,” he said while talking to APP.\nAmbassador Bernhard said the successful bilateral development cooperation between the two countries spanned over decades. “The current portfolio encompasses more than 500 million euros in the areas of renewable energy and climate change, sustainable economic development and good governance,” he added.\nHe said the COVID-19 pandemic had highlighted the importance of access to health and education facilities, and stressed the need to support the weakest parts of the society.\nHe said the German Government had decided to upscale its support to local Pakistani governments in their fight against the pandemic. It had made available 0.5 million euros to Pakistan to promote activities, which would help mitigate the socioeconomic effects of the pandemic at a local level.\nGermany would also commit 6 million euros to support the Pakistani communities hosting Afghan refugees, to improve local health and education services, he added.\nThe ambassador said the projects would be implemented by the German development organization Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development.",
