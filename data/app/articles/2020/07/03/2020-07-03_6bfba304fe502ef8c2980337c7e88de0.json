Everything can be grown here but the nation is not benefiting from these blessings of the Almighty and also not preserving for the coming generations.\nHe added that from the world’s second highest point K-2 to down the sea level in Karachi its full of nature and biodiversity.\n“The project costs round Rs 4 billion where special allocation has been made in this year’s budget and current financial years funds have been transferred to the provinces for implementation of the project,” he added.\nAmin Aslam mentioned that these protected areas were notified identified in the 1970s by George Scaller of the World Conservative Society including Kirthar and Lal Suhanra national parks but lacked organized governance system.\nThe Adviser added that the national parks under Protected Areas Initiative would be made model national parks whereas a National Park Service would be established that would comprise of youth.\n“As many as 5,000 jobs would be created under this initiative where the local communities residing in the vicinity of these national parks would be given due share in this regard. The aim of this project is to ensure eco-tourism through national parks as the world over national parks had strong linkage with sustainable and eco-friendly tourism.”\nHe went on to mention that proper legislation was required to regulate these national parks where Khyber Pakhtunkhwa had devised its regulations and Punjab Cabinet had also approved its laws and would be consequently ratified by the provincial assembly.\nHe added that every national park would have its conservation fund whereas the local communities would be engaged to take ownership in preserving the national parks as their own reserves.\n“Prime Minister Imran Khan before his venture into politics wrote about dwindling wildlife resources and under pressure forest cover in his book ‘The Indus Journey’ whereas this initiative is response to that book,” he added.\nProtected Areas Initiative, he said would help in preserving the distinctive wildlife species like snow leopard, markhor in the North, Blue Sheep, Urial, Marcopolo sheep, blind dolphin etc.\n“There has been record maintained in prior regimes regarding these wildlife species for enlistment as the world identifies such species. This is Prime Minister Imran Khan’s vision.\nThe Adviser also noted that the Prime Minister was also given update on mega cities’ master plan including the provinces of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Punjab and others. “The agricultural land has been consumed into the urban areas and green cover has been ripped off in many cities in the name of development which would be halted to avoid food security, ecological and environmental threats taking place due to rapid and unplanned urbanization.\nThe prior disgruntled regimes never focused on the future of coming generations rather catered their own vested interests whereas this project was launched keeping in view the coming generations.\nHe added that global environmental experts namely George Scaller of World Conservation Society, Kathy Mc Kinon of World Commission on Protected Areas, Alex Mc William of IUCN Asia Protected Area Partnership sent their video messages to the government and appreciated the project.",
