At the onset of pandemic, the repatriation of citizens from the host countries was not an easy jog but the present government rose to the challenge and took a lead in reuniting the overseas Pakistanis with their loved ones amid the pandemic.\nThe repatriation of a whooping number of stranded Pakistanis in such a short span of time validates Prime Minister Imran Khan’s vows for well-being of the Pakistani diaspora, which always stands firm in bad breaks of the country.  “This all happened due to improved coordination among all the stakeholders, in-time mobilization of human and financial resources, active participation of affluent overseas Pakistani community in relief activities abroad, effective diplomatic efforts and above all the political will,” said a senior officer of the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development (OP&HRD) on Tuesday.\nTalking to APP, he said the government had brought back above 200,000 stranded nationals under the special flight operation that ended on June 20 after the resumption of normal flight operation. “At least 553 flights were operated under the special flight operation which was carried out between April 1 and June 20,” he added.

Similarly, 17,062 were repatriated form Qatar, 7,122 form the United Kingdom, 11,792 Oman, 4,714 (Including 331 Detainees, 80 Tablighis) from Malaysia, over 4, 000 from Afghanistan (via land and air routes), 1702 the United States of America, 924 Iran (via land route) and 418 from India (via land route).\nMultiple countries such as Australia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Canada, China, Congo, Egypt, Germany, Iraq, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Maldives, Norway ,South Africa, Somalia Sri Lanka, Sudan Turkey, Thailand, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan were also among others from where a number of stranded nationals were airlifted by the government. The repatriated nationals also included Tablighis (2,018), prisoners/ detainees (1,745) and Zaireen (1,326), said the document. The officer said the government did not limit its focus to the repatriation operation only as it had also taken extensive measures to provide food, accommodation and free air tickets to the destitute Pakistanis, stuck in foreign countries due to massive lay off, caused due to socioeconomic impact of the pandemic on private sector.\nA reintegration programme for jobless Pakistani expatriates was also in making as the OP&HRD ministry has chalked out a complete plan for their re-employment. Highlighting the relief activities of the Pakistani missions and consulate generals abroad, he said the Community Welfare Attaches and officers of Ministry of Foreign Affairs had distributed around 36,000 ration bags, worth 20 million, among the overseas Pakistanis.
