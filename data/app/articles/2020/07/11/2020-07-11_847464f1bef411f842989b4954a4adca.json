The Federal government is providing 4500 tons of furnace oil daily and can provide another 500 tons of furnace oil, he added.\nHe said that Bin Qasim Power plant can be run on furnace oil and by running Bin Qasim, 190 MW will be added to the system.\nHe added that K Electric will have to plan for the future, with Karachi’s pack demand at 3,500 to 3,600 MW, adding that K-Electric plans to add 2,150 MW to the system in the next three years.\nThe K-Electric officials said that by the summer of next year, 550 MW will be added to the system with the help of the national grid, 800 MW by April 2022 and another 800 MW in 2023.\nLater, the Federal Minister Asad Umar along with Imran Ismail joined the participants of sit-in outside the K-Electric Office here and addressed to them.\nTalking to media on the occasion, the Governor Sindh said that they have come here on the directives of the Prime Minister and some decisions have been taken in today’s meeting, which, will help overcome the power crisis and end unannounced load shedding in the city from tomorrow (July 11).\nSpeaking about the over-billing issue, he said that he will take this matter to NEPRA and Audit of the K-Electric will be performed by NEPRA and the money taken in terms of over-billing will be returned.\nLater, the sit-in was ended on the assurances from the Sindh Governor and Federal Minister Asad Umar.",
