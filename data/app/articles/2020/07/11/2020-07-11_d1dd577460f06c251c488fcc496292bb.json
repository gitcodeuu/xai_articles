The prevailing situation of COVID-19 was much better than India.\nHe said the prime minister had not only talked about daily wagers besides strengthening economy in a wake of the pandemic, adding the government had set up 129 laborites across the country to diagnose the patients.\nNo unrest and chaos were observed during the smart lockdown in the country, he added.",
