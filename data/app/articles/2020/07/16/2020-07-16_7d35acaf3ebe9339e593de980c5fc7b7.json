However, the Prime Minister’s COVID-19 Relief Tigers Force would assist the plantation project in various districts across the country.\nAmin mentioned that the volunteers of the Tiger Force would be involved on need basis by the relevant district administrations across the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
