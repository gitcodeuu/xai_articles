  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 16 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz said on Thursday that Rs 400 billion construction projects would be initiated by the end of December this year. Addressing a news conference along with Prime Minister’s Special Assistant on Poverty Alleviation and Social Protection Dr Sania Nishtar, he said a mega project for the construction of houses and apartments worth  Rs145 billion would be started by October while many more would follow the suit. He said Prime Minister Imran Khan was giving special attention to the uplift of the construction sector as this had the potential to revive the national economy as well as realize the dream of\ndisadvantaged segments of the society to own their houses.\nShibli Faraz said the people building five Marla houses would be given\nloans on 5 percent markup whereas for the ten Marla houses, the mark\nup rate will be 7 percent. He said that the schedule for payment of\ninstallments would be within the reach of the low income groups.\nShibli Faraz said the Prime Minister today chaired a meeting of the\nNational Coordination Committee on Housing, Construction and\nDevelopment to personally monitor the situation and ensure steps to\nremove impediments in launching housing projects. He said that the\nmeeting was attended by the country’s prominent builders and\ndevelopers. The meeting discussed several proposals to uplift\nthe sector including holding international road shows for construction\nrelated projects to attract investment from expatriates. The meeting\ndiscussed in details all issues ranging from taxes and maps and\nutilities. Mechanism for lending to the construction sector was also\ndiscussed, he informed.\nThe objective of the meetings of the National Coordinating\nCommittee was to maintain liaison with all stakeholders, he added.\nHe said the Prime Minister has decided to hold the meeting of the\ncommittee every two or three days keeping in view the importance of\nthe sector. The minister said the focus of the Prime Minister’s\npolicies were the middle class and poor segments of the society.\nShibli said that recent auctions of Capital Development Authority\nfetched more than expected returns which were the manifestation that\nthe environment for the construction sector in the country was\nconducive.\nHe said the builders and developers and general public should take\nadvantage of the government’s construction policy by December.\nA one-window operation system, he said was devised to reduce\nthe time required for clearance of the documents.\nShibli Faraz said the government has asked the banks to dedicate about\nRs 330 billion of their lending portfolio for the construction\nindustry. So far the banks’ lending for the housing\nsector was less than one percent whereas in neighbouring India, this\nratio was over 27 per cent. An increase in banks lending\nwould revolutionize the housing industry as so far there was no\nconcept of a mortgage in Pakistan, he remarked.\nShibli Faraz said that the people of Pakistan did not suffer much as\ncompared to many other countries. The outbreak of\ncoronavirus has made the government more determined to save the people\nfrom problems, he concluded.",
