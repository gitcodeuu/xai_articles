In an attempt to evade a free and fair plebiscite that respects the wishes of the Kashmiri people., as required under several UN Security Council resolutions, India has been attempting since 5August 2019, to alter the demography of the occupied territory. She also highlighted that demographic alterations in an occupied territory have been definitively categorized as a violation of the obligation to respect the right to self-determination, as highlighted by the International Court of Justice in Paragraph 122 of its Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Constitution of a Wall in the Occupied Palestine Territory.\nIn this regard to High Commissioner an urgent intervention with respect to bringing to an end these breaches of fundamental human rights norms.\nIf we do not act together now, we may risk further destabilization and bloodshed in the region, which would affect millions on both sides of the Line of Control, the Pakistan-India border and in the region at large, she added.",
