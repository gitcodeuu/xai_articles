No impartial and transparent investigations into the violence has been conducted to this day.\n“Reportedly fabricated charges of sedition, murder, and terrorism under repressive anti-terror and national security laws – such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the National Security Act – have been filed against activists and human rights defenders participating in the protests,” the statement said.\nThose arrested and detained included Gulfisha Fatima, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita, Khalid Saifi, Meeran Haider, Shifa ur Rehman, Isharat Jahan, Dr Kafeel Khan, Sharjeel Imam, Akhil Gogoi and Asif Iqbal. They were still in prison despite repeated calls for their release by national and international human rights groups and the United Nations, it added.\nThe ICJ and OMCT said severe restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly and association had been imposed in the framework of the COVID-19 emergency, including blanket shutdown of Internet services and the imposition in several areas of Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code, a colonial law banning public protests and gathering of more than five people.\n“While appreciating India’s efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19, we remind the government that restrictions must meet the requirements of legality, necessity and proportionality and shall not be abused to muffle dissent.”\nThe ICJ and OMCT said the right to life and from the prohibition of torture and other ill-treatment as well as the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly were protected under international laws, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to which India was a party.\n“We further call for a thorough, prompt, transparent and impartial investigation into allegations of unlawful use of force by police, and for the immediate release of all unjustly detained activists and HRDs (human rights defenders),” they stressed in the statement.",
