In the meanwhile, all programme strengths and capacities were redirected to support the ongoing COVID surveillance and response efforts at different levels.\nThe programme has been vigilantly monitoring the evolving risks of COVID as well as the polio and other vaccine preventable diseases across Pakistan.\nThe suspension of immunization activities was due to lockdowns, closure of OPDs and travel difficulties disrupted essential health interventions. The provisions of essential vaccines to around 700,000 newborns per month were seriously affected while the suspension of door to door campaigns also widened immunity gap among vulnerable children significantly diluting the gains made during December 2019 to March 2020 as the programme was recovering from 2019 crisis.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
