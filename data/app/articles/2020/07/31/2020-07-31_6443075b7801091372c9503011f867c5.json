It shows that we will knock the disease for six,” he commented while standing in an empty playground with no player around.\nHe said though he was sad for not traveling whole of Pakistan, the same sacrifices were paying off with lower COVID-19 cases in Pakistan and called for extra caution on Eidul Azha.\nThe high commissioner also announced that British Airways was resuming its flights from Pakistan what was the manifestation of Pak-UK friendship.",
