  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 09 (APP):Advisor to the Prime Minister on Parliamentary Affairs Babar Awan on Thursday hoped that people would find surprising facts in the forensic report to be made public on April 25, and Prime Minister Imran Khan would never abandon the inquiry process against sugar and flour mafia.\nTalking to a private news channel, he assured that the final forensic report would definitely invite strict action against such elements but, added that it must be given time to come after examining its multiple aspects.\nBabar Awan said the government had set a good example which need to be followed by making public details of thousands of billions of loans taken during previous regimes.\nHe said that earlier, the Parliament took two years to pass Zainab Bill instead of 30 days.\nTo a question about the differences between the prime minister and Jahangir Tareen, he said the latter had reposed his confidence in the leadership of the former.\nThis was the first Parliament in the political history of the country which was giving priority to transparency and accountability over legislation, he maintained.",
