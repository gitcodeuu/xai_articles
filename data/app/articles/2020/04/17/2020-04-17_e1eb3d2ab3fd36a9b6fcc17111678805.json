In 2019, India violated 3,351 times through indiscriminate firings at the Line of Control and the Working Boundary.\n“Pakistan continue to respond to India’s belligerence. We remind India once again to respect the 2003 ceasefire agreement,” she said.\nSpokesperson Farooqui said Pakistan welcomed the joint communique of G20 finance ministers and their efforts for global economic recovery as the world fought the coronavirus pandemic.\nShe said on April 12, Prime Minister Imran Khan appealed for global initiative of relief, underlying that the global recession could be overcome with coordinated efforts.\nTo a question, the spokesperson rebutted the statement issued by the US Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), and said the Government of Pakistan was protecting all of its citizens without any discrimination.\nUnder the Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme, out of the 6.5 million beneficiaries that have received cash assistance in Category-I, 400,000 (6.15%) were non-Muslims, she added.\nShe told the media that Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, US Special Representative for Afghanistan Reconciliation, and General Austin Scott Miller, Commander Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan, visited Pakistan on Thursday and called on Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa. During the meeting, matters of mutual interest, overall regional security situation, including Afghan refugees issue and Afghan reconciliation process, were discussed.\nTo a question, she said the sale of missile systems, along with technical assistance and logistic support to India by the United States at the time when there was a global effort to fight the pandemic was particularly disturbing. Pakistan had articulated its concerns regarding the sale of sophisticated weapons to India which would further destabilize the region.\n“This will destabilize the already volatile situation in South Asia. There is a high possibility of India conducting a false flag operation while global efforts are directed towards combating the pandemic,” she remarked.\nThe spokesperson apprised the media that the Kartarpur border point had been closed till April 24, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Reopening of the corridor depended on the situation with regards to the global health emergency, she added.\nShe said the Pakistan Army had shot down the Indian Quadcopter which crossed the LOC. Such anti-Pakistan activities of the Indian armed forces were irresponsible.\nPakistan would continue to respond to such violations in a befitting manner, the spokesperson added.",
