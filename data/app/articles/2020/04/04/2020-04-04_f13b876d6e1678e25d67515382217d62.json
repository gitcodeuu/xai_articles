She said that Prime Minister Imran Khan had introduced an incremental lockdown while ensuring an uninterrupted food-supply chain, creation of a volunteer force and a adoption of a mechanism in this regard.\nAbout non payment of wages to workers during the lockdown, the SAPM on Information and Broadcasting said that the government was preparing database of the businesses which had not paid to their workers during the 14 days of the lockdown, adding that PM Imran Khan had held meetings with office-bearers of chambers of commerce and mill-owners across the country and the government would pay salaries to workers who are left jobless and it had earmarked 200 billion rupees for the purpose. She said the prime minister had taken a people-friendly initiative to provide food to the needy.\nAbout support to those rendered jobless due to lockdown, she said that 16 million had so far registered for financial support from PM’s Ehsaas Programme, adding that data of 10 million applicants had been verified and they would be transferred 12,000 rupees each from April 5 (Monday) while the rest of 6 million would get the financial support after due process. “This is unprecedented in the country’s history that a poor person would get Rs 12,000,” she said adding that the federal government had set aside 150 billion rupees for Ehsaas Progrmme, adding that the Rs 10 billion financial package by the Punjab government was in addition to it.\nAbout the opposition’s role, she urged the need for political harmony in the country, adding that all political parties should work together to curb the deadly virus rather than remaining divided for petty interests.
