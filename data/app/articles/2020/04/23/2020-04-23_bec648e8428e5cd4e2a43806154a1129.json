While going to the mosque, you must understand that it involves risk to your life and for others too,” the prime minister said addressing the Ehsaas Telethon jointly hosted by multiple television channels and online platforms for fund raising to support the people hard hit by the lockdown owing to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHosted by Senator Faisal Javed, the transmission was participated by the news anchors representing the partnering media groups including Hamid Mir (Geo), Kashif Abbasi (ARY News), Nadeem Malik (Samaa News), Kamran Shahid (Dunya News), Sami Ibrahim (Bol News), Shiffa Yousfzai (Hum News), Muniba Mazari (PTV News), Mansoor Khan (Express News) and Mohammad Malick (92 News).\nAround Rs 550 million were raised during the three and a half hour long transmission which marked live calls from the top businessmen, corporate heads, renowned sportsmen, overseas Pakistanis, artists and philanthropists, and responded by the prime minister.\nFollowing the telethon, the total deposits in the PM Relief Fund for COVID 19 touched Rs 2.76 billion as further donations continued to pour in the advertised account number 4162786786 of National Bank of Pakistan’s Main Branch at II Chundrigarh, Karachi.\nThe prime minister, who also responded queries from the news anchors, said the coronavirus was a challenge to test any nation’s capability to stand up to it and hoped that Pakistan would rise as a greater nation after sailing through the ordeal.\nHe said the economic impact of the pandemic would increase in future as the people would exhaust their savings and need support. In such a scenario, the nation would have to face the situation collectively, he added.\nHe said after scraping, the government had announced Rs 144 billion Ehsaas Emergency Cash Scheme to support around 12 million families in a transparent and apolitical manner.\nHe advised the people not to fall prey to any misunderstanding or notions of stronger immunity among the Pakistanis against the virus rather take all the precautions advised by the doctors.\nHe said before launching the fund-raising, the government had completed its financial controls to ensure the donated money was spent transparently.\nThe prime minister said the government was moving to the smart lockdown to close the areas with the coronavirus outbreak because he feared the people could die of starvation amidst strict closures aimed for their protection against the pandemic.\nHe said the government had already started reopening some industries and the donations would help support the people until they resume their earnings. Realizing the sufferings of the poor class, the government decided to open the construction industry which would also revive all allied industries.\nHe said the great economies like the United States were afraid of possible economic breakdown as was evident from his Wednesday’s telephonic interaction with US President Donald Trump whom he called mainly to thank him for supporting his global call for debt relief to the developing countries to enable them utilize their resources on anti-COVID operations.\nThe prime minister said he was too much concerned about the future of the small businesses for what the government would soon announce a relief package.\nTo a question, the prime minister reiterated his stance that there could be no lockdown or even social distancing in the slums like Machhar Colony or Liyari areas of Karachi where multiple family members shared a single room and also lacked clean water.\nHe said while making any decision to impose full lockdown, the provincial governments must also think of such people, not only the elite class.\nThe prime minister said perceiving the nation’s mindset of preferring to pray at mosques, particularly during the holy month of Ramazan, the government agreed upon 20-point guidelines with the religious scholars who now owed responsibility for its true implementation.\nHowever, he advised the people to prefer praying at home during the holy month as other Muslim countries had not allowed prayer congregations.\nHe agreed that the reopening of the businesses would increase the risk for coronavirus transmission, but the government would adopt track and trace method to contain the diseases.\nHe said the government was expecting the coronavirus cases to reach around 15,000 by next week and the second half of May could be difficult when the hospitals could face pressure.\nTo a question, the prime minister assured the donors that their donations would be spent transparently as the government had established a complete database of the needy people and had also de-listed around 0.8 million non-entitled ones.\nHe said all the government agencies, including the Federal Investigation Agency, police and Inter Services Intelligence, were engaged under the Ehsaas Progamme to detect and apprehend any corrupt elements.\nThe main chunk of the cash scheme went to opposition-led Sindh province which was ample to manifest its apolitical execution, he added.\nThe prime minister said so far, it was the poor class that was bearing the brunt of the situation and the affluent class should come forward to give out to the country in need of the hour.\nHe said the government was alive to the difficulties being faced by the overseas Pakistanis and was deliberating the strategy for their repatriation which was linked with sufficient quarantine facilities.\nThe transmission was concluded with the special prayer by Maulana Taiq Jameel, who also advised the people to recite the supplications like Ayat Kareem to seek Allah Almighty’s forgiveness and blessings in the distressing situation.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
