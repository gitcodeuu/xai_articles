The country was also discussing, like the rest of the world, impacts of a complete lockdown on its economy and poor people, he added. “As the situation evolves from country to country we will have to adjust to our own ground realities.”\nQureshi said it was a defining moment in the history as the world had not seen a challenge like it since the Second World War. He paid tributes to the health workers, who had laid down their lives in the war.\nAbout the collective response of Pakistani leadership to the pandemic, the foreign minister said both the federal and provincial governments were working in unison to counter the COVID-19.\nHe said at the federal level a National Coordination Committee (NCC) and National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) had been set up to deal with the situation along with the provincial governments.\nThe foreign minister said till Thursday Pakistan had confirmed 224 deaths from the novel coronavirus while the total number of cases had surged to 10,513. The number was unfortunately rising as the country was at the peak of the virus, he said and added that fortunately, Pakistan was quick to develop a national coordination plan to counter the virus.\nThe National Action Plan had been prepared with the consultation of Federal Government, NDMA and provincial governments, he added.\nThe foreign minister said as initial estimates Pakistan required $ 595 million to overcome gaps in its health system, which was still fragile like many developing countries.\nHe said Pakistan had limited number of testing facilities, inadequate system for isolation and quarantine, lack of trained staff, equipment, and weak surveillance system to monitor the spread of virus.\nHe, however, said Pakistan was addressing the challenges according to its resources and had taken a number of initiatives. He said 124,549 tests had so far been done. The testing facility was 11,000 tests per day, which by the end of the month it would be increased to 25,000, he added.\nHe said the positive rate of the COVID-19 in Pakistan was 8 percent, the country had 70 rapid response teams in place but the requirements were far high. Pakistan had 154 districts and it required 124 at least rapid response force teams.\nHe said a countrywide lockdown had been imposed and it had been eased in certain areas to save the people from starvation. “We feel we will be closed to 200,000 cases by July this year and for it the country needs to increase its testing capacity to at least 20,000 tests a day, and increase the number of laboratories to at least 154.”\nHe said Pakistan had made a considerable improvement in the last few weeks.\nQureshi said Pakistan needed at least 10,000 ventilators, besides other equipment to deal with the immediate challenge.\n“I encourage bilateral, multi-lateral to join hands with the Government of Pakistan to strengthen our health infrastructure. COVID-19 is a common enemy and we need a common agenda, a common strategy sector, we need a common strategy to deal with the situation.”\nQureshi thanked the IMF Managing Director, World Band President and United Nations Secretary General for initiating advocacy for getting financial relief to the developing countries.\nHe said Prime Minister Imran Khan on April 12 had launched a global appeal for relief to the developing countries in debt due to suffering of their economies from COVID-19. He himself had also spoken to at least 30 foreign ministers so far.\nThey were a fiscal space to save lives and to give the economic stimulus, he added.",
