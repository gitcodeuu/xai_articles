Anjum Nisar apprised the committee about the restriction on exports especially on Afghan Transit trade, enforcement of the SBP interest rate with immediate effect, waiver of restriction of CNIC on transactions and tax exemptions on CNG sector. He also suggested for implementation of the decision of the government for waiver of demurrage charges imposed on ships at seaports.\nAjmal Baloch suggested that rents and utility bills of shopkeepers and small traders might be waived for the duration of pandemic, besides allowing small traders to open their businesses for small duration subject to observance of health guidelines and standard operation procedures (SOPs) by the health department.\nHe also suggested for provision of interest free loans for small traders and shopkeepers for the revival of their businesses.\nMinister for Industries and Production Muhammad Hamad Azhar said the government was focusing to address economic woes of the business community, especially the small traders and their electricity bills would be waived for next six months.\nHe said almost 95 percent small businesses used commercial meters and now the electricity and gas bills would be paid by the government itself during the lockdown.
