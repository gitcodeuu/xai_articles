  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 06 (APP):The eight-month military siege, in Indian Occupied Kashmir, now coupled with curfew-like restrictions, which India has imposed in the garb of preventive measures against the spread of coronavirus, has added to the miseries of the hapless Kashmiri people.\nThe restrictions have created a shortage of daily commodities especially lifesaving medicines, putting the lives of patients at high risk,Kashmir Media Service reported.\nDrug distributors in Srinagar told media men that lifesaving drugs were not available and the supply had been badly affected particularly during the past two weeks.

These two incidents of suicide raised the number of such deaths among Indian troops and police personnel in occupied Kashmir to 449 since January 2007.\nAP Maheshwari, the Director General of India’s largest paramilitary force, the Central Reserve Police Force, along with 200 other personnel has gone on quarantine on the suspicion of being positive for coronavirus.
