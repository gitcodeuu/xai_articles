About Rs 30 billion would be paid on account of Drawback of Local Taxes and Levies (DLTL) through the Commerce Ministry, while Rs 10 billion through FASTER sales tax mechanism, under which record refunds had already been made to the exporters.\nLikewise, he said, Rs 52 billion would be paid as the sales tax refunds to the non-exporters, whereas Rs15 billion was being refunded in duty drawbacks.
