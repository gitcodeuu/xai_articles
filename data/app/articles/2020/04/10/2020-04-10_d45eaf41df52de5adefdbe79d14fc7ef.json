Of these 22 districts, there are 17 Muslim-majority districts – 10 in Kashmir, six in Jammu and one in Ladakh, three Hindu-majority districts one Buddhist-majority district”.\nRegarding maneuvering of statistics relating to the Muslim population by India in occupied Kashmir, the communique said, “The percentage of the Muslim population in Indian occupied is nearly the same as that of 1961 whereas the percentage of the Muslim majority in India has increased from 10.70% in 1961 to 14.23%.”\nThe main cause behind the decline of the Muslim population in Kashmir, he said was genocide and ethnic cleansing carried out by India against Kashmiris.\nThe communique further mentioned that the settlement of non-state subject immediately after 1947 was also an important factor for the decline of the Muslim population in several districts of the state particularly in Jammu province that witnessed large-scale killing of Muslims during the turbulent days of the partition of the subcontinent.\nIn their efforts to change the demographic composition of the state and to frustrate the people’s movement for right self-determination, the memorandum added that the successive governments of India adopted oppressive measures that including the killing of the innocent people, enforced disappearances, extra-judicial killings and forced migrations.\nAbout abrogation of the Article 370 and 35 A of the Indian Constitution, the memo said that revocation of these laws led to bifurcation of the state into two Union territories. “This was merely done to fulfill the long-pending demand of Hindus to ease the restrictions of purchasing land/property inside the Muslim majority areas and trigger an inflow of settlers on large scale in the region”, the memo added.\n“This constitutional onslaught indicates Indian strategy to neutralize the dispute by replacing existing Muslim majority with other ethnicities, thus consolidate New Delhi’s influence over the region and help in gradually lessening the intensity of the dispute”, the communique said adding that after the abrogation of the special status of the Jammu and Kashmir, the BJP government took multiple steps to change the demographic composition of the state.\nAt a time, when the whole world was busy fighting the pandemic of COVID-19, the BJP government dropped yet another bombshell on Kashmiris thereby changing domicile rules of Jammu and Kashmir, the communique said.\n“The redefinition of domicile rules have caused fear psychoses among the inhabitants and is largely seen by locals as a conspiracy to change the demography of the state besides depriving them of their resources, jobs, identity, cultural, land and above the promised right of self-determination”, the KIIR chief said adding that the new law announced by the Indian Ministry of Home Affairs also provided domicile status to the children of Central government officials who have served in Indian Occupied Kashmir for a total period of 10 years.\nWani said that the constitutional onslaught by India clearly shows that to settle outsiders in Kashmir has been sole motive behind the Indian government’s plan to revoke Article 370 of the Indian constitution.\nUrging world community to play its much needed role to address the age-old issue, the KIIR chief said that the people of Jammu and Kashmir who were struggling for their right to self- determination despite all complexities hope that sooner or later the international community will fulfill its responsibilities and play its role for the resolution of the longstanding dispute pending on the United Nations agenda.",
