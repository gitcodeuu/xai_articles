The first tranche booked items from China have reached today. It included 50 mobile X-Ray machines, 1 lac testing kits, 1 lac N-95 masks and five lac surgical masks.”\nHe added that around 2million surgical masks, 196 ICU ventilators, testing kits and surgical masks were imported from China part of huge order.\n“The coming week or ten days are very crucial for Pakistan as per the situation of the pandemic. Therefore, people must stay at home and avoid unnecessary outdoor activities to contain coronavirus.”\nThe Adviser added that the ministry was working under a three tier plan in line with the coordinated efforts of the government to reduce the risk of Coronavirus. “It comprises of prevention, mitigation and recovery as in different parts of the country were lying on these three stages.”\nHe said the equipment acquired by NDMA would be distributed to the hospitals across the country. However, the Authority had developed committees at district level in coordination with the Chief Secretaries of the provinces.\nThe Adviser informed that a World Bank funding of Rs9.5 billion was also received by the ministry and would utilized for the recovery phase of the plan. “This funding would be used to create jobs and support the unemployed masses in the post corona virus scenario.”\nThe Ministry’s biggest project of 10 billion Tree Tsunami plantation was halted after the coronavirus outbreak. However, after requesting the Prime Minister, the plantation was revived and around 65,000 daily waged workers were working in this project. “These workers are doing plantation, raising nurseries, guarding the plantation enclosures at Rs600 per daily wages.

Moreover, there are also projects related to Eco-tourism and Electric vehicles that will also be supported by NDRMF.”\nThe project, he said had got principal approval and when it would be given to NDRMF, it would put similar efforts in the project as it made in developing the Fund.\nBlue economy namely fisheries was also neglected in the country where NDRMF would take measures to boost it for economic well-being of the country, he added.\nGeneral (R) Nadeem Ahmed said that since the government was striving hard in fighting against COVID-19, NDRMF had started negotiations with Asian Development Bank to get $100 million to support the mitigation measures. “After this funding the total contribution of NDRMF to contain Corona Virus will reach up to $210 million.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
