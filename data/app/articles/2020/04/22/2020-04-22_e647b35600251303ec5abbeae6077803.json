In Sindh, it was decided that industries having labour in its premises would initiate their operations after complying with the SOPs.

He said the inbound and outbound air traffic was going on whereas pressure was being built up to open domestic flights as well.\nHe suggested that limited flights should be allowed at domestic level as partial domestic flights for Gilgit Baltistan were operational and chartered flights were also going on. “Private local airlines should be allowed along with the PIA to operate on alternate days whereas SOPs for international and domestic flights in GB are already in place and both should be enforced separately.”\nMinister for Railways Sheikh Rashid said the Pakistan Railways had carried around 285,000 passengers from Karachi during the implementation of lockdown in Sindh.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
