  "content": "KARACHI, Apr 12 (APP):Federal Minister for Maritime Affairs Ali Zaidi on Sunday said that unfortunately non of the previous governments focused on the development of health sector of the country.\nAddressing a presser, he said the coronavirus was a global pandemic against which all the countries had to combat collectively. The doctors were our front-line warriors against the disease so keeping their protection in the view Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) had been arranged.\nHe said the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) identified the hospitals for provision of PPEs to doctors and medical professionals according to availability of ventilators. Unfortunately as per the data there was no single hospital in Northern Sindh with availability of ventilator.
