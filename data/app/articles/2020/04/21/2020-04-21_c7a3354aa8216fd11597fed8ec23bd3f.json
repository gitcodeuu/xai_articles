The pilot test was conducted in various selected areas of the country which remained successful.\nIn the pilot test, he said the tracking system was made and health teams reached out the target patients and all those people with whom the corona patient had met during few days. All such people were tested and then kept isolated or hospitalized if needed, he added.\nUmar said the results of those pilot tests were received yesterday and discussed in the meeting of National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) on Tuesday.\nUnder this programme, he informed that every district, tehsil and union council would be approached for testing.\nHe explained that in this programme the top hierarchy would consist of SAPM to PM on health, all provincial health ministers and focal person to the PM on COVID-19 Dr Faisal Sultan.\nHe said the technology teams would support on national level while on provincial levels, such teams would be formed which would approach deep to the union council level.\nThe minister said Pakistan Army was fully supporting in technology area and management matters.\nHe said this system would help those who lost their jobs or earnings due to lockdown and they would get the opportunity to resume their earnings.\nAsad Umar also termed the allegations of India about sending corona patients from Pakistan baseless and said the world had shown the failed policy of the Indian government that how thousands of people were clustered at one place which caused spread of the virus at large scale.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
