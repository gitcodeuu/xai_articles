The role of the Pakistani community in Europe, especially in Spain, in standing in solidarity with their Spanish compatriots also came under discussion.\nHighlighting Prime Minister Imran Khan’s initiative that debt relief for developing countries would allow them to dedicate greater resources to counter the disease and shore up economies, Qureshi pointed out that the initiative was gaining traction, and hoped that the European Union would continue to extend full support to it.\nThe foreign minister expressed deep concerns on the humanitarian and human rights situation in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJ&K), where 8 million Kashmiris were being deprived of critical information and essential medical supplies due to on-going restrictions on communication and movement.\nFurther underscoring the danger to the health and safety of hundreds of Kashmiri leaders, youth and civil society members incarcerated by India in crowded prisons, he called on the EU to uphold the human rights principles and call upon India to lift all restrictions, allow unfettered supply of goods and medicine, and release all prisoners.\nThe situation in Afghanistan, particularly with reference to the Peace Agreement between the US and the Taliban, also came under discussion.\nForeign Minister Qureshi and the High Representative noted that the Agreement offered an historic opportunity for the Afghan leadership to pursue reconciliation and help establish durable peace and stability in Afghanistan.\nThe foreign minister reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to continue to support an Afghan-owned and Afghan-led peace and reconciliation process as part of a shared responsibility.\nThe High Representative thanked Foreign Minister Qureshi for his expression of solidarity and agreed that a coordinated approach remained the best way forward to deal with the pandemic. He informed that debt rescheduling of the developing countries was high on agenda of the EU. The two sides agreed to remain engaged on all issues of common concern.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
