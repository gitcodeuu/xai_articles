It uses Bluetooth signals to determine if someone is near another TraceTogether user, making proximity data encrypted and stored on the phone.\nQureshi thanked the Singapore government for facilitating the return of Pakistani nationals from Singapore.\nThe Singapore Foreign Minister also appreciated Pakistan’s support in the repatriation of Singaporean nationals from Pakistan.\nForeign Minister Qureshi highlighted Prime Minister Imran Khan’s call for debt relief and restructuring to help developing countries create the fiscal space needed to combat the disease, save precious human lives and shore up economies.\nThe two Foreign Ministers agreed to stay engaged on Covid-19 and other matters of mutual interest.",
