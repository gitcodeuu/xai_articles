  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 24 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir President, Sardar Masood Khan Friday said that India has intensified its atrocities and persecution campaign against the people of Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir(IOJ&K) in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.\nIn an exclusive interview with Radio Pakistan, he said whilst the world is preoccupied with COVID-19, it is imperative that the human rights situation in the occupied territory as well as the key question of the right to self-determination of the Kashmiri people must remain on the global agenda and must continue to receive world attention.\nHe said the UN Security Council should immediately convene an emergency meeting to take notice of the genocide being committed in India occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe AJK President said virtual diplomacy has been started to keep the world’s attention focused on the lingering dispute. In this regard, contacts have been established through video link with the Kashmiri people and parliamentarians in Britain.\nHe appreciated Radio Pakistan, especially its digital portal for consistently highlighting the Kashmir dispute. On behalf of the people of Jammu and Kashmir, he expressed his gratitude to the top administration of Radio Pakistan for raising the voice of oppressed Kashmiri people through its tweets and posts.\nDrawing attention towards the situation prevailing in IOJ&K, the AJK President recalled that a ruthless lockdown is in place in the occupied territory since 5th August last year.\nDuring this period, he said, the people have been subjected to brute force and violence. In addition to the arrest of the political leadership, thousands of children have also been arrested.\nHe said despite the breakout of coronavirus, the process of atrocities is still continuing in the valley.\nHe said the number of youth killed is far higher which has been reported. A new history of oppression is being written in IOJ&K amidst the coronavirus challenge.\nHe said the detained political leadership and the youth have been kept in cramped concentration centers and there is greater threat of spread of the contagion.\nThe AJK President regretted that the fascist regime in India has not paid any head to the appeals made by the human rights organizations and the spokesperson of the UN Secretary General about the plight of these detainees.\nSardar Masood Khan pointed out that India is resorting to increased violations on the line of control to divert the attention of the world from its war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide in the occupied territory .\nHe said India is using heavy weapons including cluster bombs during the unprovoked firing across the border.\nThe AJK President strongly rejected the Indian allegations that Pakistan and Azad Kashmir is sending coronavirus patients across the line of control.\nDescribing it a white lie, he appealed to the people to reject and abhor this propaganda campaign. He said the international community is not listening to the Indian allegations as it understands that how a coronavirus patient can enter the valley after passing through a difficult terrain.\nReferring to the immense sacrifices of Kashmiri people spanning over seven decades, the AJK President said the brave and valiant people of Kashmir have not surrendered regardless of rendering five hundred thousand lives in the struggle for right to self-determination. He said this is an open message to India that the Kashmiri people will never accept defeat that they will continue their fight till the realization of their ultimate goal. He was confident that the Kashmiri people will emerge victorious in this legitimate struggle and the evil forces will bite the dust.\nThe AJK President also dilated upon the steps taken in coordination with the federal government to contain the spread of Coronavirus in Azad Kashmir.
