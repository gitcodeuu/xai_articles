  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 16 (APP):Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Information and Broadcasting Dr Firdous Ashiq said on Thursday that safety of the people should be the top priority of the federal and provincial governments.\nIn a tweet, she said that no one was discrediting Chief Minister Sindh Murad ALI Shah,but holding lengthy press conferences in the presence of the relevant joint forum, was mere political point scoring.\nShe said that from day one, the federal government was saying that the country needed national unity and solidarity, not politics at this critical point.\nShe said that the claim of Chief Minister Sindh that he never heard someone dying with hunger was strange.\nShe questioned if he was waiting for people dying with hunger. Moreover she asked if Murad Ali Shah has ever met labourers and daily wagers.\nDr Firdous advised Sindh chief minister that instead of isolating people of Karachi in quarantine, he should have pity on the plight of the people of interior Sindh.",
