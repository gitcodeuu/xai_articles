Furthermore, these documents were dynamic and evolving as more science was published about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus syndrome 2 (SARS-COV 2).\nIt highlighted that the advisories,

of the disease, initiatives and interventions also needed to be continuously evaluated and updated.\nIn Pakistan the Health ministry had taken novel initiatives along with key interventions to address this enormous challenge whereas the chronological order of interventions was as follows: 22nd Jan- Creation of Emergency operation center, 23rd Jan- Establishing the most comprehensive health screening mechanism in Pakistan’s history at all major airports, which later resulted in screening of more than 1.1 Million passengers, 28th Jan- Establishment of Health Information desk at arrival

challenge in such situations was information flow to the masses and ensuring that the disease basics, its spread, its influence on the day to day life and drastic measures taken to counter them at the national and provincial level such as lockdowns and inhibiting social mergence were understood and followed.\nThe Ministry in this regard has undertaken some major steps in ensuring the risk communication remains a corner stone of the strategy for countering COVID-19 spread.
