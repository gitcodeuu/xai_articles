The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) would provide the kits directly to hospitals.\nHe said training sessions would be conducted for the health workers, who would hopefully use the equipment properly.\nHe said the Federal Cabinet had approved the assistance package for the front line healthcare workers, who were fighting against COVID-19. “Any healthcare worker, who dies while performing duties related to COVID-19, will be entitled to the same package as is applicable to the government servants in case of security-related deaths under Shuhadaa Package.”\nHe said there were two types of the package, one for the death of a government employee due to medical reason and the second for the death due to security reasons like bomb blast or terrorist activity.\nNow all such health workers, he added, would also be eligible for the ‘Shuhadaa Package’, who died while treating the corona patients. As per grades, the package started from Rs 3 million to Rs 10 million.\nBesides the cash amount, there would be 100 percent pension, free education, holding of government residence, support in plot, jobs to the deceased’s children, health care to family members and benevolent fund allocation, he added.\nDr Mirza said there were eight components of the package, which would be given to the health workers as per the decision of Federal Government. The package would be applicable in the Federal Capital, Azad Jammu and Kashmir, and Gilgit Baltistan.\n“This is a gesture of Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Federal Cabinet for the front line healthcare workers, who are working as the front force against corona. We are much worried about the lives of these health workers but also committed\nto take every possible step for their safety.”\nHe added that meetings were held with the provincial health ministers and central leadership of Pakistan Medical Association (PMA) to discuss the measures for the safety of medical practitioners.\nHe said there was consensus that the federal and provincial governments would take similar steps to provide safety and support to the health workers. A national programme in that regard was being prepared, which would be announced soon. Under the programme, a national level drive would be started to show solidarity and support to all front line health staff, he added.\nSharing breakup of the corona cases, Dr Zafar Mirza said over 157,000 tests had been conducted in Pakistan.
