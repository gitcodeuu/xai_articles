  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 30 (APP):The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Thursday provided modern medical equipment to the Children Hospital Quetta as part of its ongoing work to support the provincial government and improve public health care services in hospitals in Balochistan.\nThe equipment valued at Rs7 million includes a fully automated chemistry analyzer, an instrument used for the biochemical testing of total bilirubin, urea, creatinine, liver function, cholesterol, uric acid, triglyceride and calcium in patients.\nWith this new instrument, the hospital will offer free testing to the most needy Pakistanis and Afghans. Biochemical testing in private laboratories would otherwise cost around Rs2,000.\n“This is the fastest testing machine in Balochistan, with the capacity of testing 60 patients per hour. This machine is very productive which eases the ever-increasing pressures on time,” said the Medical Superintendent of the Children Hospital, Dr Sher Ahmed Satakzai.\nThe Head of UNHCR’s Sub-Office in Quetta, Zephania Amuiri said, “The UNHCR not only aims to strengthen the public health care system but also to support the refugee and Pakistani community at this difficult time.”\nHe added that although the coronavirus outbreak had disrupted some activities, the UNHCR in Pakistan was responding to the COVID-19 pandemic while also continuing its core programme in support of the provincial government health department, and the refugee and host communities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
