  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 30 (APP):Prime Minister Imran Khan Thursday said since the country’s situation in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak was not as bad as was being expected, Pakistan with the grace of Allah Almighty would soon overcome the challenge and be one of the countries getting out of the deadly virus speedily.\n“If we compare Pakistan with other countries, the situation is far better. What we were expecting was that till now hospitals, especially Intensive Care Units (ICUs) should have been filled with the coronavirus patients, besides the shortage of ventilators. But thanks God, the situation is far better,” he said.\nThe prime minister expressed these views in a televised media briefing here after chairing a meeting on COVID-19.\nHe was flanked by Minister for Planning and Development Asad Umar, Minister for Industries and Production Hammad Azhar, Special Assistant to the PM on Social Safety and Poverty Alleviation Dr Sania Nishtar, Special Assistant to the PM on Health Dr Zafar Mirza and the PM’s Focal Person on COVID-19 Dr Faisal Sultan.\nThe prime minister said the government’s effective measures, including the decision of going for lockdown, closure of schools and colleges, restrictions on gatherings after the registration of 26 coronavirus positive cases as well as the cooperation of masses were behind the not so bad situation.\nHe mentioned his telephonic conversations with Iranian President Hassan Rouhani and Egyptian President Abdel Fatteh Sisi, and said the discussions focused on the situation arising out of the coronavirus outbreak.\nReferring to his conversation with President Hassan Rouhani, the prime minister said Iran, which was badly hit by COVID-19 and had so far lost around 5,500 lives, had decided to ease restrictions and open some industries, including construction and small businesses to check economic difficulties faced by the people, particularly the poor and low income group.\nHe said Egypt, which also faced economic hardships like Pakistan, was already following the practice of a partial lockdown with restrictions on crowded activities, had also decided to further ease the restrictions for the relief of poor.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan and Egypt would benefit from each other’s experiences and strategies to overcome the challenges faced by the two countries in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.\nHe said as he was worried for the poor and daily wage earners from very first day of the lockdown, he was proud of his government’s Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme under which Rs 12,000 per family were being distributed among 12 million poor people across the country.\nThe prime minister said under the Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme, which was apolitical, transport and merit based, Rs 81 billion had so far been distributed among 6.6 million families during the last three weeks and the remaining out of 12 million people would also get the financial assistance soon.\nThe prime minister said besides the Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme, he would soon announce another programme to provide relief to the people unemployed due to the lockdown in the wake of COVID-19.\nUnder the new programme, he said, an SMS service would be launched to register the unemployed people and provide them with the financial assistance after verification of their data and claim of unemployment.\nSecondly, he said, the people from the volunteer Corona Tiger Force would also reach out to the people at union council level to get the unemployed people registered for financial assistance from the government.\nImran Khan said unlike the developed countries where 100 percent people were registered and could be easily accessed by the government in case of emergency, around 80 to 85 percent labourers, daily wager, vendors etc. were not registered with government institutions.\nThe development and creation of workers and labour data would help the government and people alike in any such situation or otherwise in future, he added.\nThe prime minister said the Corona Relief Fund, established to help the people affected by the coronavirus lockdown, would be bolstered by the government by depositing the amounts to match the contribution from the masses with a one to four ratio.\n“Fore example, if an amount of Rs 100,000 is deposited in the PM Corona Relief Fund by a person, the government will deposit Rs 400,000 in the fund make it Rs 500,000,” he explained.\nThe prime minister mentioned the situation in the United States and European countries where thousands of people had died of COVID-19 and said the situation in Pakistan with the blessings of Allah Almighty was far better.\nHe said with no vaccine so far available for COVID-19, no body knew how long the situation would continue in the world, including Pakistan.\nImra Khan urged the citizens to behave responsibly, and follow the guidelines and protocols given by the experts for people in every field of life to save themselves from the coronavirus.\nHe said since the government alone could not succeed in the fight against COVID-19 pandemic, it was the whole nation which by demonstrating responsibility together, could defeat the deadly virus.\nThe prime minister was highly appreciative of the efforts of Dr Sania Nishtar in the launching of Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan said that as doctors and para medical staff were on the forefront in the fight against COVID-19, it was the government’s first priority to protect them and provide them with the protective gear.\nHe said after the difficulties faced by the country in the initial days, now production of protective equipment as well as the ventilators had been started by Pakistani industries, and after fulfilling the local needs, the products would also be exported.\nThe prime minister said the government was fully cognizant of the problems faced by overseas Pakistanis in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak and considered them as country’s asset and real VIPs who served Pakistan by remitting precious foreign exchange.\nMinister for Planning and Development Asad Umar said that with less number of deaths as against the earlier projections of thousands of deaths due to COVID-19 by end of April, the situation in Pakistan was not out of control.\nHe hoped that after the conclusion of current lockdown on May 9, the government through discussion and review of the situation in the next meeting of National Coordination Committee (NCC) would ease some lockdown restrictions.\nHowever, on the economic front, he said that due to COVID-19, Pakistan was expected to face 30 to 35 percent reduction in its revenue collection this year.\nBesides, Asad Umar said according to a latest survey Pakistan was among 10 to 15 developing countries facing increase in poverty at individual levels in the wake of COVID-19 outbreak.\nSpecial Assistant to the PM on Social Safety and Poverty Alleviation Dr Sania Nishtar said that Rs 81 million had so far been distributed among the deserving 6.6 million families and those who had not received the financial assistance of Rs 12000 would get the same within the next ten days.\nShe warned the people not to pay heed to any fake messages of receiving financial assistance and visit the distribution points only after getting a confirmation message or SMS from 8171 – a service from Ehsaas Programme.\nDr. Faisal Sultan said Pakistan has now enough COVID-19 data for regular analysation of the disease and its trend.\nHe said all the government decisions regarding COVID-19 were taken on the basis of regular data analysation and ground realities by health experts and other stakeholders.\nSpecial Assistant to PM on Health Dr. Zafar Mirza said that with the addition of 874 people during the last 24 hours, the total number of coronavirus positive cases in Pakistan to date stood at 15800 out of which over 4000 had recovered and 346 died.\nHe said that since 80 to 85 percent people were recovering after getting ill due to COVID-19 in the world over, the situation in Pakistan was better.\nMinister for Industries and Production Hammad Azhar said that the government by realising the difficulties faced by small and medium enterprises had allocated Rs 50 billion to provide relief in electricity bills of SMEs for three months.\nHe said that 3.5 million SMEs would get benefit from the relief programme under which the government would pay electricity bills of SMEs having commercial meters with 5kw to 70kw monthly consumption during the next three months.",
