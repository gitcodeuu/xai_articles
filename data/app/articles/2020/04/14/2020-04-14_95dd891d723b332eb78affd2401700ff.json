However, the existing closure/ban on areas of congregation like schools, marriage halls, cinemas, restaurants etc would remain in place, she said.\nDr Firdous Ashiq Awan said there were a variety of opinions on this issue and it was recommended that the provinces should decide on that issue as per their own judgment and circumstances.\nIt was also recommended to all the provinces, AJK and GB that individual shops of electricians, plumbers, carpenters, tailors, street vendors be allowed to open.",
