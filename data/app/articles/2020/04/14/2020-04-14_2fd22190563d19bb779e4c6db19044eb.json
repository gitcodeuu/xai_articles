The overall steps taken at the national level had helped control the disease in a better way, he added.\nHe, however, said,”We all have to play a responsible role as the threat of spreading the disease still exits.” There was fluctuation in the figure of death numbers which were even reported 14 in a day while 46 patients were on ventilator, he added.\nDr Mirza said the first coronavirus case was reported very late in Pakistan on February 26 as compared to other countries, while the first meeting of National Security Council (NSC) was held on March 13, to make major decisions on the disease.\nHe said the Federal Government had prepared standard operating procedures (SOPs), which had also been shared with the provinces for their implementation by the manufacturing units and industries, which were being opened.\nThe World Health Organization’s recommendations were also included in the SOPs, he added.",
