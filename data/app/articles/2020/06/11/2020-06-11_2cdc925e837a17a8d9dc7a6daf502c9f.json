  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 11 (APP):Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) has intensified its activities to meet the nuclear electricity generation target of 8,800 MW by the year 2030 set through government’s Energy Security Plan formulated in 2005.\nAccording to Economic Survey 2019-20 released here Thursday, completion of K-2/K-3 project will be a big step that will bring PAEC 2200 MW closer to achieving this target.\nPAEC is planning to develop additional sites to house more nuclear power plants in the future and sites identified throughout the country. These sites are being investigated and acquired for development. Ample technical and engineering infrastructure is already in place to support both the existing and the under construction nuclear power plants, the survey said.\nSkilled manpower is being produced regularly by Indigenous institutes, imparting state of the art training and education in all relevant disciplines and at all levels, from technical trainings to academic programmes.\nThese instruments are enough to successfully support the foreseeable future ambitions envisioned by PAEC for the future nuclear power programme of Pakistan.\nPAEC is the sole department in Pakistan engaged in electricity generation using nuclear technology. There are five nuclear power plants operating on two sites in the country, one unit namely, Karachi Nuclear Power Plant (KANUPP) at Karachi and four units of Chashma Nuclear Power Plants (C-I, C-2, C-3 & C-4) at Chashma (Mianwali District of Punjab Province). The gross capacity of these five nuclear power plants is 1430 MW that supplied about 7,143 million units of electricity to the national grid during 1st July 2019 to 31st March 2020. KANUPP, the oldest of the lot has surpassed its design life of 30 years and has, in fact, completed 48 years of safe and successful operation.\nThe four units of Chashma are amongst the best performing electricity generating plants in the country, in terms of endurance and availability.\nTwo more units with a total output of 2200 MW are currently under construction near the KANUPP site in Karachi, the Karachi Nuclear Power Plants (K-2 and K-3).\nFirst concrete of K-2 was poured on the 20th of August 2015 and that of K-3 on the 31st of May 2016.\nConstruction of K-2/K-3 is on full swing and is in its final stages with more than half of civil work already in place. Functional tests of different modules of K-2 are expected to start shortly and the plant is likely to connect to the grid by the end of year.\nPAEC has undertaken construction of another nuclear power plant at Chashma near Mianwali. The site already is home to four operating nuclear plants. This unit will be called C-5 and it will replicate the design characteristics of K-2 and K-3.\nA contract for its construction has been signed with China and extensive studies for site evaluation are currently underway.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
