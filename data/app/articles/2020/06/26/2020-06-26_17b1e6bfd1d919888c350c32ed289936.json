Protection against harassment of women at workplace is an area of priority for both the entities to ensure safe and secure working environment.\nOmbudsperson for Protection against Harassment, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in partnership with UN women Pakistan, is working to implement the legislation through strengthening existing mechanisms, raising awareness, producing knowledge products and enhancing the capacity of Ombudsperson Office and other public and private actors on the effective implementation and monitoring of the law to take effective measures for ending harassment at the workplace.\nOmbudsperson KP Rukhshanda Naz said, “Our emphasis is on the execution and smooth implementation of the Workplace Harassment Law to make sure that the environment is safe for women to reach their full potential and contribute to the economy.”\nAisha Mukhtar, Country Representative a.i. UN Women Pakistan, said, “harassment at workplace is a pervasive issue that hampers women’s economic empowerment and their access to employment opportunities.\nIt affects not only victims and their families but also the whole economy in form of decline in productivity and job losses. It is encouraging to see more women speaking up about their experiences of sexual harassment and there is a need to enhance the capacities of institutions to effectively respond to complaints.\nIn order to expand economic opportunities for women and increase women’s labor force participation, we must endeavor to make workplaces safer for women.\nThis toolkit is an important step towards achieving this goal.”\nDue to the current challenging situation of COVID-19 emergency and tense work environment, the availability of toolkit will be instrumental in curtailing the incidence of violence against women.\nThe virtual launch of toolkit was attended by government officials, member of civil societies, national and international humanitarian organizations, representatives from academia and people from different spheres of life from across the country.",
