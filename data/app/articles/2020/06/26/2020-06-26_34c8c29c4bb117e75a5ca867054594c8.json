He is not a normal person. His party RSS is production of Hitler’s Nazi party.\nThey consider them a follower of the Nazi party and regard that as their role model. That is why they do such acts,” the prime minister said addressing the launching ceremony of Ehsaas Emergency Cash Programme for the families living along the Line of Control.\nOn the prime minister’s directive, all the 138,275 families of 219 villages have been declared entitled for the emergency cash assistance.
