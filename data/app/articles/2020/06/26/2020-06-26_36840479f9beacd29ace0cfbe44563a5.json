Pakistan was in fact seeking justice for the hapless Kashmiri victims of Indian aggression, he added.\nHuman Rights Activist Mushaal Hussein Mullick passionately called for an unconditional release of the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir’s (IOJK) leadership from the jails to ensure safety of their lives amid the coronavirus pandemic.\nShe demanded the unconditional release of all the prisoners, locked up in the Indian jails, including the Kashmiri women, children and elderly citizens.\nSouth Asian Strategic Stability Institute (SASSI) University Chairperson Dr Maria Sultan, in her speech, highlighted the current Kashmir situation and its implications on the Kashmiri people and the region.\nMaria said by abrogating articles 370 and 35-A India had usurped all the rights of Kashmiri people.  Even today extrajudicial killing of three innocent Kashmiris was committed by the trigger-happy Indian Army in the IOJK, she added.\nAmbassador Asif Durrani and former minister and legal expert Ahmer Bilal Sofi also highlighted the tyrannies of Indian armed forces in the occupied valley.\nA 10-minute long documentary was also screened during the seminar to highlight the decades-long freedom struggle of Kashmiris. Ordeals of the victims of torture and locals were also showed, narrating their mental and physical agony under the Indian subjugation.",
