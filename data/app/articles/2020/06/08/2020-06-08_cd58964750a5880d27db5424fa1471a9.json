  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 8 (APP):Pakistan on Monday categorically rejected India’s malicious assertions, based on complete distortion of\nfacts to advance its false and self-serving narrative.\n“The Indian Ministry of External Affairs’ statement of 5 June 2020 is continuation of their desperate\ncampaign to divert international attention from India’s state-terrorism in Indian Occupied Jammu and\nKashmir (IOJ&K) and its continuing crimes against the Kashmiri people,” a Foreign Office statement\nsaid issued here.\nThe Foreign Office mentioned that “even the remarks of the Prime Minister of Pakistan have been\ncompletely twisted. This mischievous attempt is highly condemnable.”\nIt said: “Pakistan has been the principal victim of terrorism, including terrorism perpetrated against\nour people from across the border. Tens of thousands of our citizens have lost their lives, while thousands\nof our valiant law enforcement personnel have made the ultimate sacrifice in Pakistan’s resolute fight\nagainst terrorism.”\nThe Foreign Office said Pakistan’s sacrifices and contribution in combating the scourge of terrorism,\nhad been recognized by the international community.\n“Senior Indian officials and other Indian commentators have frequently boasted about destabilizing\nparts of Pakistan and of their nefarious designs to use terrorism as state policy against Pakistan,” it\nsaid.\n“Today, the Hindutva-driven saffron terror against India’s minorities, Indian state-terrorism in IOJ&K,\nand India’s use of terrorism as an instrument to destabilize its neighbours stands fully exposed. It is\nIndia that is seeking to distort and misrepresent the report of the UN Security Council’s Analytical\nSupport and Sanctions Monitoring Team to promote its anti-Pakistan propaganda,” it added.\nThe Foreign Office said expressed hope that the world community would not be misled.  “Pakistan’s\nrole as a facilitator to the ongoing peace process in Afghanistan has been widely acknowledged by the\nrelevant international partners. Pakistan had, since the beginning of the Afghan Peace process, alerted\nthe international community about the role of spoilers in the region, who do not wish to see peace, stability\nand prosperity return to Afghanistan and waste no opportunity to create obstacles in the successful\nadvancement of the peace process.”\n“We wish to reiterate that all relevant partner countries must guard against such attempts, while\nsupporting the process for an inclusive and comprehensive political settlement in Afghanistan,” it said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
