The BJP and RSS want to wipe out minorities including Muslims and Christians from India by 2021.\nHe said the molestation of Muslim ladies and setting fire to Holy Quran are actions which deserve the attention of the entire Muslim world.\nEgyptian Professor Dr Kamal Helbawi stressed the peaceful, progressive and moderate spirit of Islam and said Muslims are being deliberately painted by India as terrorists in order to hide its own atrocities against the Muslims and also to justify its aggressive behavior towards neighboring Muslim countries.\nHe also stressed that both Kashmir and Palestine deserve equal attention and support for their liberation struggle from the Muslims around the world.\nTurkish Professor Dr Hamit Ersoy highlighted the fact that India and Israel are jointly working against the Muslim world and deliberately painting Muslim freedom struggles against foreign occupation as terrorism in order to justify their continued occupation and oppression and caste Muslims in a negative light as extremists and terrorists.\nHe said Muslims should look at the ultimate State model of Madina, their holy book Quran and the life of their last Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) for inspiration and developing a perfect, peaceful and stable political system instead of looking at the major powers who are exploiting them on the false pretexts of secularism and democracy, for solutions and help.\nHe said the BJP’s rise in Indian politics is rooted in its philosophy of hatred, which was evident even in 1992 when the demolition of Babri mosque brought them to power.\nHe pointed out that seventy-six percent of all hate crimes in India are against the Muslims.\nDr Farhan Mujahid Chak augmented Dr Ersoy’s argument by urging the Muslim scholars to look for indigenous and innovative solutions for resolving their important issues.\nIn his concluding remarks Executive President of IPS Khalid Rahman reminded the international audience that India did not exist in its current form before 1947 and sixty percent of its territory consisted of provinces while forty percent consisted of princely states which were ruled by the British.\nHe underlined the fact that British introduced the policy of divide and rule in this region which earlier was a thriving economy, stable polity and a diverse and rich society, under centuries of Muslim rule.\nHe emphasized that Muslims have contributed to the economy, society, culture, architecture, habits in profound and constructive manner through good governance before the British introduced divide and rule policy.\nHe concluded by recommending that Muslims must learn from their costly mistakes and dependence over other powers and raise awareness, improve education, spread information, pursue engagement and active lobbying to influence the world in pursuit of their collective interests and to resolve common issues.",
