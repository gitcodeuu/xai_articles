  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP):Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mahmood Qureshi Tuesday said that 50 per cent staff of the Indian High Commission\nfor Pakistan in Islamabad would have to leave for their homeland on the reciprocal measures after Indian External Affairs sought 50% reduction in the staff strength of the High Commission for Pakistan in New Delhi.\nIn a press statement, the foreign minister said India had leveled baseless allegations against Pak High Commission staff.\nAfter suffering a shameful defeat during a border clash with China, India had been trying to divert attention from its domestic affairs on different pretexts, he added.\nThe minister said the Foreign Office had categorically rejected and strongly condemned all the baseless allegations made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs. India did not have any regard for the diplomatic norms, he added.\nToday, the world was witnessing a surge of discrimination against the Muslims and minorities in India. The sentiments about Islamophobia had been whipped up in India, even the Hindu population was weary of Hindutva mindset. About 12 million people in India had been rendered jobless due to coronavirus pandemic, Qureshi added.\nThe foreign minister further said that Modi came into power on the basis of Pakistan bashing campaign, but BJP suffered defeats in five states after which they staged Pulwama drama.\nHe said the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) contact group on Jammu and Kashmir had strongly rejected Indian aggression in the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nIt also rejected the discrimination of Muslims and other minorities in India. He said today, the international community considered India as potential threat to the regional peace.",
