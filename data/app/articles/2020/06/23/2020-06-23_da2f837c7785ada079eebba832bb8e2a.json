  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP):Pakistan on Tuesday categorically rejected and strongly condemned the baseless allegations made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) as a pretext to seek 50 per cent reduction in staff strength of the High Commission for Pakistan in New Delhi.\n“Pakistan completely dismisses allegations of any violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by the officials of the High Commission for Pakistan in New Delhi and reiterates that they always function within the parameters of international law and diplomatic norms,” the foreign office spokesperson in a press release said.\nThe Indian Chargé d’ Affaires in Islamabad was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to convey Pakistan’s rejection and condemnation of the baseless Indian allegations.\nThe Indian Chargé d’ Affaires was also informed of Pakistan’s decision to reduce the Indian High Commission’s staff strength by 50 per cent as a reciprocal measure and he was asked to implement the decision conveyed to him within seven days.\nPakistan also rejected the insinuations of intimidation of Indian High Commission officials in Islamabad. The Indian government’s smear campaign against Pakistan could not obfuscate illegal activities in which the Indian High Commission officials were found involved in.\n“The MEA’s statement is another effort to distort facts and deny the culpability of these Indian High Commission officials in criminal offences,” it further added.\nIt said the latest Indian action was a part of India’s desperate attempts to divert attention from its state-terrorism and worst human rights violations in Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IoJ&K).\n“India would be better advised to focus on its internal and external issues, rather than creating diversions at the cost of peace and stability in South Asia.\nPakistan has been consistently sensitizing the world community that irresponsible policies of the BJP government are increasingly imperiling the regional peace and stability,” the spokesman further said.",
