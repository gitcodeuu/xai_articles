  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 17 (APP):Advisor to the Prime Minister on National Security Affairs Dr Moeed Yusaf on Wednesday said the Indian government was following expansionist policy of hindutwa which led it to total isolation in the region.\nHe said now, the international community including China was openly opposing the Indian false claim about Kashmir issue as its internal matter. He reminded the international community to play its due role against violation of human rights in the held Kashmir.\nIn a talk show programme of a private news channel, the advisor said all the regional states should remain vigil about the expected role of India in the wake of ongoing Cino-US tensed relationship.\nHe said, “we have made all preparations against India’s attempt of surgical strike in Azad Kashmir.”\nHe said Pakistan had always worked for establishing peace in the region, but unfortunately, the Indian government’s response had always remained in contrary.\nAbout the government’s decision to resume international flight, Dr Moeed Yusaf said it was a difficult decision however, 40000 to 45000 overseas Pakistanis would be brought back to the country every week from June 20.\nHe said a proper strategy had been devised under which passengers with symptoms of COVID-19 would be kept in quarantine. The decision of resuming international flights was taken in the light of written requests by all provinces after due consultations at NCOC, he added.\nTo a question, he said the news of resuming international flights was a big surprise of the prime minister for the stranded Pakistanis, mostly the labour class which would mitigate their miseries.\nHe said the air fares would automatically lower with healthy competition due to 250 flight operations on weekly basis.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
