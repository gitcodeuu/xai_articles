  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 06 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz on Saturday asked political parties especially the opposition to act\nresponsibly and avoid blame game on tackling of the challenge of coronavirus pandemic.\nAddressing media along with Minister for Communications and Postal Services Murad Saeed, he said unfortunately some political\nparties were indulging in political point scoring on the issue of coronavirus.\nHe said Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah was part and parcel of decision making process in the National Coordination and\nOperation Centre (NCOC), but he had the habit of issuing baseless statements later, adding the opposition could not digest the way the PTI government had handed the crisis.\nHe said Pakistan People’s Party Chairman Bilwal Bhutto Zardari also during a press conference today had made baseless allegations\nagainst the federal government which was an effort to mislead the masses.\nThe minister said with the grace of Allah Almighty and the sagacious policies of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government under the\nleadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan, Pakistan’s tackling of the outbreak of coronavirus was far better than many advanced countries\nhaving robust economies and modern healthcare systems.\nShibli Faraz said the government had adopted a comprehensive roadmap to handle the coronavirus challenge which was being\nappreciated at world level.\nHe said the government had adopted the policy of saving lives as well as the protecting the vulnerable segments of the society from hunger\nand starvation, adding despite economic constraints, the government gave a mammoth stimulus package of Rs 1.2 trillion to\nprovide cushion and support to every segment of the society affected by the contagion.\nHe said NCOC had been chalking out efficient strategies all the time to meet the challenge. All the stakeholders including medical experts and chief ministers of the provinces were part of the NCOC which had been collecting and monitoring data on daily basis and formulating future line of action, he added.\nThe minister said every loss of human life due to the pandemic was regrettable but so far the loss of lives and number of patients in Pakistan were far less than the estimates of the experts which was manifestation of the success of the policy adopted by the government.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
