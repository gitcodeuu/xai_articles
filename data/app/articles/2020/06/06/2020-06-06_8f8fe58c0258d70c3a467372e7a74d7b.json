to their native rural localities during the lockdown.\nMalik Amin Aslam said these jobs were mostly related to nurseries established to promote greenery and to check wildfires in forest areas during the peak summer.\nHe said Pakistan had become the first nation in the world to repurpose World Bank funds available to it to for revival of nature in the country in post-COVID-19 situation.\nThe

pandemic.\nMalik Amin Aslam said that PM would soon launch an initiative to conserve protected natural areas and national parks across the country.\nHe said that Clean, Green Pakistan initiative of the present government being followed in 20 cities of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was also playing an important role to conserve nature and environment in the country.\nFPCCI President Mian Anjum Nisar said that environmental degradation had been responsible for slow economic progress and backwardness of the poor sections of the Pakistani population.\nHe said that exponential increase in the population had been responsible for the destruction of forests and nature reserves in the country due to ever-expanding human settlements.\nMian Anjum Nisar said that irresponsible and unreasonable exploitation of the natural and mineral resources in the country had been responsible for various socio-economic and health issues faced by the citizens.\nHe said that Pakistan should focus on claiming carbon credits on the basis of its ever-increasing economic activities as being done by its neighbouring countries.\nDr. Shahid Amjad, former director-general of National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), stressed the need to conserve mangrove forests for protection of the marine ecosystem of the country.\nHe said that conservation of the coastal resources in the country should be made part of the national accounting system owing to their importance for a large section of Pakistani population.\nDirector General of Pakistan Environmental Protection Agency Farzana Altaf said that the Pakistan Environmental Protection Act-1997 envisaged imprisonment up to two years for anyone causing harm to the environment but such harsh measures against environmental degradation were seldom used.\nDirector General of Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) Naeem Mughal said the SEPA had become the first environmental watchdog in the country, which initiated the process of penalizing the government-run civic and municipal agencies for causing harm to the environment.\nHe acknowledged the situation that much had to be done to check discharge of the hazardous industrial effluents into the sea and other valuable water bodies in Sindh that were the primary source of drinking water for people.\nEnvironmentalist Saquib Ejaz Hussain said that infectious waste being generated by the hospitals, isolation, and quarantine facilities could become major sources of coronavirus spread in the country.\nHe said that proper safety guidelines should be enforced in the country for safe and quick disposal of such hazardous clinical waste instead of handling it through conventional means of garbage collection.\nNIO Director General Dr. Nuzhat Khan said that lockdown measures enforced in the country had contributed a lot in the conservation of the coastal areas of the country as same positive impacts should be sustained through careful human activity on the coastline in the post-COVID-19 scenario.\nConvener of the Central Standing Committee of FPCCI on Environment Naeem Qureshi said that his standing committee would continue to serve as a liaison between academia and industry in the country to do useful research for resolving pressing environmental problems in the country.\nSenior Vice Chairman of Businessmen Panel Mian Zahid Hussain, Dr. Moazzam Ali Khan, Shabina
