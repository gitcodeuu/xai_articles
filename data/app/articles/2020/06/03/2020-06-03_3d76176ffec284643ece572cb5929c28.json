He opined that the PML-N was divided into various factions. The pictures from London, which had gone viral, showed that the elder Sharif was active and could return to Pakistan any time, and it might be a message for Leader of the Opposition (younger Sharif). He alleged that Shehbaz Sharif would pose himself like a warier, who had conquered Kashmir, while he was hiding from the National Accountability Court. It was under consideration to place his name of the Exit Control List as sufficient evidence of his wrongdoings was available and he could be arrested any time, he added.It might be Shehbaz’s desire to go abroad but he would not be allowed to do so, for which all the legal formalities would be fulfilled, the minister said.To a question on the possibility of the government now going tough against the violation of SOPs and precautionary measures, he said there would certainly be strictness now in that regard The shopping centres’ administration, shopkeepers and transporters would be held responsible if the related SOPs were not complied with strictly, he warned. The general public was still taking the virus threat lightly though people from all segments of the society had already been affected by it, he added.About Shehbaz Sharif’s skipping of NAB raid, he said he could not comment on how he got the clue of the activity in advance and that question should be asked from the Bureau.The minister said transparency was ensured in giving away cash to the lockdown affected families and so far over Rs 112 billion had been distributed.To another question, he contended that all and sundry had witnessed that how the opposition pushed for holding the National Assembly (NA) and Senate sessions, but their leadership stayed away fearing for their lives, leaving their party legislators at the mercy of virus.He alleged that the opposition had been holding the legislatures hostage instead of playing their due role for legislation in the interest of masses. They only wanted to make issues and seek production of their jailed leaders, while their leadership preferred to stay way. Now they were trying to make the NA speaker controversial in relation to the production orders, which was totally unjustified, he added. The minister said those, who had looted the national wealth and plundered the institutions, were roaming free and would appreciate a court judgement if it was in their favour or else they would criticizing the judiciary.He rejected the opposition’s allegation of political victimization in the name of accountability. When the PTI ministers, including Azam Swati, Babar Awan, Aleem Khan and Sibtain Khan, faced allegations, they stepped down to clear their names, he added.The minister said gone were the days when the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) and the PML-N leaders used to cover up wrongdoings of one another and now they were upset over the ongoing accountability as they would not go scot free.He remarked that the government believed in transparency unlike the previous ruling parties whose leaders would even draw salaries of their personal drivers and cooks from the national exchequer. He said the mechanism for transparency in giving away advertisements to regional newspapers was being finalized and in that context he would have a meeting with the stakeholders towards the end of current week. He strongly believed that the regional press was important part of the national media and it would be given its due share in the government advertisements, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
