  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 16 (APP):Pakistan on Tuesday categorically rejected the irresponsible statement and baseless allegations made by the Indian Ministry of External Affairs in the matter relating to the involvement of Indian High Commission’s officials in “hit-and-run” incident and possession of fake currency.\n“The MEA’s statement is a reprehensible attempt to distort facts and deny the culpability of these officials in criminal offences,” foreign office spokesperson in a press release said.\nTwo officials of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad, Dwimu Brahma and Selvadas Paul, were over-speeding and crashed their car into a pedestrian yesterday on June 15. The pedestrian was seriously injured and taken to the hospital for treatment.\nThe officials attempted to flee from the scene; however, some passersby who witnessed the incident stopped them from fleeing and informed the police. The police rushed to the scene and took the officials to the police station.\nDuring the course of investigation, fake currency was also recovered from the aforementioned officials. After it was confirmed that the said officials were from the Indian High Commission, they were released and handed over to a senior diplomat from the Indian High Commission, it added.\n“The senior Indian diplomat was reminded that possession of fake currency and “hit-and-run” after an incident are serious offences. Such illegal actions and reckless conduct by the officials of the Indian High Commission are against the law and established diplomatic norms. He was also reminded of the Indian High Commission’s obligations to ensure that its members did not engage in illegal activities and adhered to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961,” the press release said.\nThe Indian MEA’s litany of baseless allegations was yet another attempt to malign Pakistan and a part of desperate efforts to divert attention from India’s state-terrorism in Indian occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IoJ&K).\nThe BJP government must realize that its irresponsible policies and unilateral actions were increasingly imperiling peace and security in the region. India must act responsibly in the interest of regional peace and stability, it added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
