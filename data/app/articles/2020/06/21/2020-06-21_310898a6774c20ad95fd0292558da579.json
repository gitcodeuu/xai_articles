  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 21 (APP):The Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC)’s Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir would hold an emergency foreign minister level meeting via video conference on Monday (June 22, 2020) to discuss the latest situation in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJK).\nThe meeting will bring together the foreign ministers of the member states of Jammu and Kashmir Contact Group including Azerbaijan, Niger, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, an OIC statement said.\nOIC Secretary General Dr Yousef Al-Othaimeen said the meeting was part of a series of continuous Jammu and Kashmir Contact Group meetings to address the Kashmir issue.\nThe meeting has been summoned in wake of the unabated extra-judicial killings of Kashmiri youth by the Indian occupation forces in IOJK and persistent other human rights violations in the territory. More than 110 innocent Kashmiris have been martyred by the Indian occupation forces during the past five months in fake “encounters” and so-called “cordon-and-search” operations, according to Foreign Office.\nIndia has incarcerated eight million Kashmiris including top Kashmiri leader with 900,000 occupation troops. The people of the IOJK have been suffering under inhuman lockdown and military siege for over 10 months following India’s illegal and unilateral action of August 5, 2019.\nWhile the world is grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, India is busy in unabashedly advancing the RSS-BJP inspired extremist Hindutva ideology with the perpetuated human rights violations against minorities in India particularly the Muslims.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
