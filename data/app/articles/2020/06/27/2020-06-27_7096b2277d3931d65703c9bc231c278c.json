  "content": "ISLAMABAD, June 27 (APP):Minister for Power and Petroleum Omar Ayub Khan on Saturday said prices of petroleum products in international market had witnessed a surge of 112 percent during the last 46 days, but the government increased just by 25 percent as it believed to give maximum relief to masses under the vision of Prime Minister Imran Khan.\n“When the petroleum prices were decreased in international market, its benefit was passed on to the masses. And now, when the prices have witnessed a sharp increase, a substantial relief has also been given to the common man by increasing just 25 percent against 112 percent of world market,” he said while addressing a news conference along with Special Assistant to Prime Minister (SAPM) on Petroleum Nadeem Babar.\nHe said fuel prices in Pakistan, being non-oil producing country, were low not only in the sub-continent but in Asia.\nRejecting a notion created by opposition parties, he said, the biggest increase in petroleum price was witnessed during the tenure of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz in mid-2014 when petrol rate jumped from Rs 75 to 108 per litre, which was the one-month biggest raise – 31 percent.\nOmar Ayub said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government believed in presenting factual position before the public, as it was facing mafia and hoarders, adding PM Imran Khan had always took bold decisions, and given priority to welfare of masses besides protecting their rights.\nThe minister said it was the PML-N, which during its last tenure in 2015 managed to stop an inquiry and protected the mafia.\nWhile, contrary to this PM Imran believed in making the inquiry reports public to expose the mafia and cartels.\nJustifying the revision of petroleum prices four-day before the schedule for the month of July, SAPM Nadeem Babar said if the price of oil cargoes, arriving in next days, was calculated based on today’s exchange rate, there was a projection of Rs31.5-32 per litre increase in petrol price with effective from July 1.\n“We did not want to make such an increase, so we went to the prime minister and finance minister and apprised them if the prices were revised with effect from July 1, there will be Rs 31.5-32 per litre increase. We found a way out and decided to expand the duration from 30 days to 35 days, as the taxes were already fixed,” he added.\nOn May 18, he said, Pakistan State Oil (PSO) purchased oil cargo at the rate of $21.7 per barrel, which increased to $31.27 per barrel on May 28 and reached $44.54 on June 20. During that period prices had increased by more than double, he added.\nAfter the increase, he said, the petrol price was at around 100 per litre in Pakistan, while it was Rs 180 per litre in India, Rs 137 in China, Rs 174 in Bangladesh, Rs 108 in Indonesia, Rs 153 in Philippine, Rs 159 in Thailand and Rs 196 in Japan.\nBefore February 28, he said petrol rate was Rs116.60 per litre and diesel Rs127.26 per liter, adding by June 1 these were brought down by Rs 42 and Rs 47 per litre respectively.\nCommenting on the recent fuel shortage, the SAPM said Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) were required to maintain 21-day stocks as per their licence condition, but almost all the companies were found short of the stock during the inspection.\nHe said the Petroleum Division had been asking Oil and Regulatory Authority (OGRA) to take action such OMCS and enforce their laws in that regard in letter and spirit.\nSimultaneously, he said the PSO was directed to do additional fuel buying as other OMCs were not maintaining their stocks, which gave the PSO 15 percent additional share in market during the current month as compared to corresponding period of last year. “PSO made 78 percent additional import.”\nHe underlined the need for strengthening OGRA by increasing its enforcement capabilities so that prompt action could be taken against all those who violated their licence conditions, adding necessary reforms would be introduced in rules and laws of the authority in that regard.\nNadeem Babar said there were around 9,000 registered petrol pumps in the country, while 15,000 were illegal which had been identified during the recent inspections. The illegal pumps were being shut down or sealed, he added.\nHe said a system was also being worked out to collect and maintain sales data of OMC depots and Petrol pumps on daily basis.\nDuring the inspection, he said it was also observed that oil depots’ sale witnessed 52 percent increase in first ten days of current month as compared to same period of last year. The increased sale was definitely hoarded somewhere like illegal petrol pumps or depots, he added.\nHe said the government had sought lists of petroleum pumps from all OMCs so that it could be put in the record that which fuel station were operating on their network.",
