The latter’s sister suffered from cardiac arrest and could not survive on hearing the news of the incident.\nThe prime minister further said the terrorists, armed with weapons, had arrived with nefarious designs to take people at the PSX as hostage, but the police and security personnel frustrated their plan.\nImran Khan said the country’s intelligence agencies were on high alert. “Four major terrorist acts have been thwarted and preempted, including two around the Federal Capital Islamabad,” he said,  adding it was a huge success and appreciated the performance and vigilance of the intelligence agencies.",
