I start my submissions with the name of Allah Almighty, the most gracious, the most\nmerciful. It is a matter of great honour and pleasure for me to present the second Annual\nBudget of the Pakistan Tehreek e Insaaf’s Government. In August 2018, a new era started\nunder the charismatic leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan. We started an arduous\njourney; a path for recovery, stabilization and growth to be achieved in the medium term.\nOur economic policies are aimed at fulfilling our promise, our commitment with the people\nof Pakistan for building a “Naya Pakistan”. Each year, we are coming closer to realizing\nthis dream.\n2. Mr. Speaker, our guiding principles in the past two years have been to weed out\ncorruption, to bring about greater transparency and accountability in government\ninstitutions and to uphold merit in our decision making at all levels. Our prime objective is\nto revive our economy and steer Pakistan onto the path of becoming of a stronger economy,\nthus achieving the ideals as envisioned by our founding fathers. We have a great trust in\nthe abilities of our people and we need their cooperation in achieving the desired goals.\n3. Tehreek e Insaaf is standing on the principle of providing social justice, improving\nthe conditions of the vulnerable and underprivileged segments of our society, and\nespousing the cause of the poor and downtrodden, which has been our vision and guiding\nprinciple.\nWhat we inherited\nMr. Speaker,\n4. Before I present budget for the next financial year, I will like to apprise this august\nhouse that when our government came into power in 2018, we inherited an economic crisis.\nThe honourable members would recall that at that time;\na) Total debt and liabilities had got doubled in last five years and reached the\nhighest level of Rs 31,000 billion, which increased our debt servicing cost\nto an unsustainable limit.\nb) Current account deficit had increased to a historic high of $20 billion\nc) Trade deficit had reached at $ 32 billion, with no growth in exports in last\nfive years.\nd) Pak Rupee was artificially over-valued which decreased our exports and\nincreased the imports.\ne) Foreign exchange reserves with the State Bank of Pakistan had declined\nfrom $18 billion to below $ 10 billion, bringing the country to the brink of\ndefault.\nf) Fiscal deficit was at highest level of Rs 2,300 billion\ng) Due to poor policies and mismanagement, power sector circular debt had\nbulged to Rs 1200 billion despite payment of Rs 485 billion by the\nprevious government.\nh) There was no restructuring of Public Sector Enterprises therefore their\nperformance was at the lowest ebb having caused a cumulative loss of\nRs 1300 billion.\ni) Interest rate was kept low to borrow more money from State Bank which\nbadly damaged the banking sector.\nj) No measures to combat money laundering and terror financing hence the\ncountry was pushed into Grey List\nMr Speaker,\n5.

Unfortunately, Corona engulfed the whole world, posing grave socio-economic\nchallenges, especially for the developing countries. Initially conceived as a health\nchallenge, Corona turned out to be an economic threat having the potential of destabilizing\nthe international economic system. Pakistan was no exception and Corona drastically\nchanged the whole scenario and results of our hard work were swept away.\n18. Protracted lock down, business closures, travel bans and social distancing resulted\nin to slowing down of economic activities, thus negatively impacting the growth patterns,\nfiscal and current account projections and investments.

Now I present Part II of the speech, which consists of tax proposals.\n2. Today Pakistan’s tax-to-GDP ratio stands at 11% which is the lowest among\nemerging countries. Regrettably this key indicator of fiscal strength has remained\nstagnant over the past 20 years. To improve this situation, we initiated a reform\nprocess, comprising of holistic strategy combining policy and administrative\nreforms to eliminate the distortions and boost quality revenue collection. The\nefforts have so far produced encouraging results with a promising future. Following\nkey achievements have been made during the year:\n· The historical trend of Pakistan’s import-led growth has been\nreplaced with high domestic-led growth.\n· Unprecedented refunds have been issued which are 119% higher\nthan last year\n· The narrow tax base has been expanded by bringing retailers into\nthe tax net, and successful installation of Point of Sales (POS)\nsystem at 6,616 retail outlets with the aim to increase the number to\n15,000 by December this year. Covid 19 has affected the business\nof common man, it is proposed to decrease sales tax rate from 14%\nto 12 % for business registered with POS. This will give relief to\ncommon man and to business also. The measure will help in\ndocumentation of economy.\n· Hotel and restaurant industry has been badly effected due to Covid19. It is proposed that minimum tax for the industry may be reduced\nfrom 1.5% to 0.5 % for six months (April to September 2020)\n· A tax return mobile app has been launched to facilitate individuals\nand salaried persons, which led to an increase of 37% in the number\nof income tax return filers.\n· An automated system of payment of taxes through online platforms\nhas been introduced.\n· Successful anti-smuggling and enforcement drives have been\ncarried out which led to increase in seizures from Rs.19 billion to 30\nbillion.\n3. By the grace of Allah, the revenue collection during the pre-covid period\nhas also been commendable. The domestic taxes witnessed a growth of 27% and\ncollection from import grew by 7%. But the expected growth in revenues was\nmarred initially by the structural adjustments in the economy and then by the\npandemic which has indiscriminately affected all countries of the world.\nResultantly, the revenue target for Finance Year 2020 of Rs. 5,503 billion which\nwas revised to Rs 4,801 billion in view of policy induced import compression was\nfurther revised downwards to Rs 3,908 billion. However, this did not deter us from\ntaking steps to avert possible economic shocks of this pandemic.\n4. There was economic meltdown, due to lockdown and reduction in economic\nactivities and Covid-19 Pandemic. To control the unemployment and economic\nmeltdown, PM Imran Khan has announced a relief package of Rs1200 billion. Due\nto this pandemic tax collection become extremely difficult. Loss in revenue\ncollection was estimated around Rs 900 billion on this account. Keeping in\nconsideration this situation target of FBR were further reduced to Rs 3900 billion.\n5. Meanwhile, a fixed tax regime was introduced for small to medium traders.\nIn addition to this a stimulus package for the construction sector was announced. It\nis expected that the timely adoption of this package shall secure livelihoods for\ndaily wagers, spur economic activity, and provide low-cost housing for the\nunderprivileged under the Naya Pakistan Housing Programme.\nMr. Speaker,\n6. We have proposed policies that would shift from support to stimulus as we\nseek to revive our economy, and eventually to fiscal consolidation once the\neconomy has recovered and capable to generate required public finances. Budget\n2020-21 has been framed to reduce business failures and to mitigate the sufferings\nthe people. Therefore, we are presenting, what can be termed as, a ‘relief budget’.\nCustoms Act, 1969\nMr. Speaker,\n7. I shall now present the changes proposed in the Customs Act, 1969. To start\nwith, it gives me immense pleasure to announce that payment of export rebates is\nbeing fully automated for direct payment to exporters’ bank accounts without any\nhuman interference. Rebate schemes are also being revised after almost a decade\nand simplified by calculating rebate claims at 4 & 6-digit levels.\nDuty Free Raw Materials\n8. Last year a comprehensive customs tariff reforms exercise was initiated by\nthis government and more than 1600 tariff lines constituting thousands of raw\nmaterials were exempted from customs duty. Continuing our efforts to reduce input\ncosts of industrial sectors, it is being proposed that raw materials may also be\nexempted, which will make them completely duty free. These items include the raw\nmaterial used in chemicals, leathers, textile, rubble and fertilizers. These tariff line\nconsists of 20,000 items which are 20% of all imports.\nReduced Rate of Customs Duty on Around 200 Tariff Lines\n9. Rate of customs duty on around 200 tariff lines consisting of raw materials\nand intermediate goods is being proposed to be reduced from 20%, 16% and 11%\nand 3% to 11%, 3% and 0%. These items include Bleaching, Rubber and raw\nmaterial for certain domestic use.\nEncouraging Domestic Engineering Sector\n10. To encourage domestic engineering sector, reduction of Regulatory Duty\non Hot Rolled Coils (HRC) is proposed to be reduced from 12.5% to 6%.\nProposals to Discourage Smuggling\n11. During recent past, various items were subject to prohibitive regulatory\nduties. While this policy succeeded in creating import compression, some of these\nitems shifted in transit for Afghanistan and found their way back into Pakistan’s\neconomy through smuggling. It is proposed that regulatory duty on items like\nfabric, sanitary ware, electrodes, blankets, pad locks may be reduced to discourage\ntheir smuggling and realize the lost revenues on this account.\nSupport for Poor Strata of Society\n12. To reduce health related costs of poor strata of our population, all duties and\ntaxes are proposed to be exempted on diagnostic kits for Corona virus and Cancer.\nSimilarly, special food supplements (dietetic foods) for children with genetic birth\nproblems are proposed to be exempted from all duties and taxes at import stage to\nreduce their cost.\nExemption of Customs Duties on Raw Materials Used in Manufacturing\nSupplementary Foods\n13. Child malnourishment and consequent growth stunting has been a major\nfocus area of our government. Supplementary foods for children and expecting\nmothers are now being manufactured in Pakistan under World Food Program. In\norder to widen the scope of coverage of this program, exemption of customs duties\non raw materials used in manufacturing of these supplementary foods is being\nproposed.\nCurtailing the Discretion of Adjudicating Authority\n14. To rationalize the punishments for smuggling, provision of minimum\npunishment is also proposed to be introduced to do away with excessive discretion\nexercised by adjudicating authorities.\nInclusion of Advance Ruling in Customs Law\n15. It is a proven fact that transparency and predictability in government\npolicies encourage investments. The concept of Advance Ruling is, thereby,\nproposed to be included in the customs law which will also be in line with\ninternational best practices.\n…:Sales Tax & FED\n16. I shall now present the proposals in Sales Tax Act, 1990 and Federal Excise\nAct, 2005.\nRelief Measures\nIncrease in the Threshold of Supplies to Unregistered Persons for Obtaining\nCNIC\n17. To broaden the tax base, the condition of CNIC was introduced in Finance\nAct 2019, since persons involved in furtherance of taxable activity need to be\ncaptured through such measures. However, in order to ease compliance cost, it is\nbeing proposed that the threshold may be enhanced from Rs. 50,000 to Rs. 100,000.\nExemption to Import of Dietetic Foods Intended for Special Medical Purposes\n18. On the request of the Ministry of National Health Services exemption is\nproposed to be granted to the import of Food for Special Medical Purpose (FSMP)\nfor the children suffering from Inherit Metabolic Syndrome whereby the body is\nunable to process the food a normal child can. For this purpose, a new serial is being\nadded to the Table 1 of the Sixth Schedule to the Sales Tax Act 1990, with the\ncondition that such exemption is available on import only.\nExtension of Exemption on Import of Covid-19 Related Health Equipment\n19. The federal government granted exemption on import and subsequent\nsupply of health equipment related to Covid-19 through SRO. 237 dated 20.03.2020\nfor a period of three months. In view of the worsening situation of the pandemic\nthis exemption is proposed to be extended for three months.\nRemoval of Anomalies\nStreamlining Eleventh Schedule to the Sales Tax Act 1990\n20. In order to effectively enforce the withholding sales tax regime, it is\nproposed that the Eleventh schedule may be substituted so as to provide for\ndeduction of the whole of the tax involved in case the supplier is unregistered or is\na Non Active Taxpayer. This will guarantee return filing culture in the country.\nMeasures for Public health\nIncrease in the Rate of FED on Imported Cigarettes and Tobacco Substitutes\nand Electronic Cigarettes\n21. FED on imported cigarettes, cheroots, cigarillos, cigars and other tobacco\nsubstitutes is being enhanced from 65% to 100% in line with WHO (World Health\nOrganization) standards. Necessary changes are also proposed to be made in Table\n1 of the First Schedule pertaining to aforesaid items to cover for tobacco substitutes\nas well as E-cigarettes.\nIncrease in the Rate of FED on Filter Rods\n22. Filter rod is a basic input material for cigarette manufacturing. Present rate\nof FED is Rs.0.75 per filter rod. To enhance the effect of monitoring and\nenforcement on tobacco consumption and tax management, it is proposed that the\nexisting rate be enhanced to Rs.1 per filter rod.\nIncrease in the Rate of FED in the Case of Energy Drinks\n23. Caffeinated Energy drinks are health hazard, hence to reduce the\nconsumption of such drinks it is proposed that the FED may be increased from 13%\nto 25% both at import and at local supply. It may be noted that aerated waters are\nalready subject to FED @13%\nIncrease in the Rate of FED in the Case of 4×4 Double Cabin Pick Up\n24. FED structure is already in place for both local and imported motor cars and\nSUVs excluding auto rickshaw falling under the PCT heading 87.03. Double cabin\npick up which is currently classified as goods transport vehicle is being reclassified\nas passenger transport vehicle, which will bring it in the ambit of FED @ 7.5% ad\nvalorem in case of locally manufactured vehicles and @ 25% in the case of\nimported ones.\nIncrease in the Rate of Potassium Chlorate 25. Sales tax is charged on standard rate of 17% on import and local supply of Potassium Chlorate and in addition to that Rs 70 per kg is also collected. On the\nrecommendation of the Match manufacturers association the rate of Rs 70 per kg\nis being enhanced to Rs 80 per kg. Provided that rate of rupees 70/80 per kilogram\nis not applicable on imports made by and supplies made to organizations under the\ncontrol of Ministry of Defense Production.\nStreamlining Measures\nMr Speaker\n26. The following measures are proposed to be adopted to streamline the tax\nsystem:\n27. FBR has introduced Point of Sales Registration System for retailers. Sales\nof these retailers is directly automated with FBR. At present sales tax is charged at\n14% on the retailers registered with Point of Sales. Covid 19 has affected the\nbusiness of common man, it is proposed to decrease sales tax rate from 14% to\n12 % for business registered with POS. This will give relief to commonman and to\nbusiness also. The measure will help in documentation of economy.\nLimit of Wastage of Raw Material\n28. Many business claims wastage more than the average wastage Ration of the\nsector and pay less sales tax. To discourage this practice, it is proposed to introduce\nSector Wise Limit of Wastage Ratio.\nWidening the Scope of Section 73-Transactions Not Admissible\n29. To widen the tax base through policy measures Section 73 was amended to\nmake it binding upon the manufacturers only to make supplies to the unregistered\nperson up to Rs 100 million in a financial year only.

I now present the proposals relating to the Income Tax:\nProposal for Ease of Doing Business\nSimplification of the Withholding Tax Regime\n40. At present, the withholding tax regime is extensive which not only\ncomplicates the monitoring of withholding taxes but also increases cost of\ncompliance for taxpayers. Therefore, in an effort to simplify withholding tax\nregime, it is proposed that 9 withholding sections may be omitted, while 5 may be\namalgamated.\nReduction in Tax Withheld from Offshore Supplier under an EPC Contract\n41. The current withholding tax rate of 30% on non-residents is too high as it\npresupposes attribution of 30% income of the plant and equipment manufactured\noutside Pakistan. Therefore, it is proposed to be rationalized which is also in line\nwith the international best practices. Such measure shall aid in facilitating CPEC\nprojects and rationalizing the incidence of tax upon them.\nRationalizing Tax on Imports\n42. To provide a level playing field to commercial importers viz-z-viz\nmanufacturers, remove distortions in the incidence of income tax on the import of\ncapital goods and raw materials, plug revenue leakages, and facilitate\nmanufacturing by SMEs, a paradigm shift in the current regime is proposed to be\nintroduced by shifting from person-specific rates to goods specific rates according\nto the type of goods, with tax @1% for capital goods, 2% for raw materials and\n5.5% for finished goods irrespective of status of the importer.\nIncrease in Threshold of Section 21(l)\n43. In order to promote ease of doing business and reduce compliance cost for\ntaxpayers running businesses the threshold per transaction delineated under section\n21(l) is proposed to be increased from Rs 10,000 to Rs 25,000. Similarly, the\nthreshold of payments under a single account head liable to disallowed as a business\ndeduction /expense under section 21(l) is proposed to be increased from\nRs 50,000 to Rs 250,000. Accounts of employees under section 21(m) is\nproposed to be increased from Rs 15,000 per month to Rs 25,000 per month.\nEnabling Adjustability 0f Property Expenses for All Individuals/AOPs\n44. In order to provide a level playing field to all individuals and AOPs, and\nremove distortion in the taxation of property income derived by individuals and\nAOPs, the option of claiming expenses is proposed to be accorded to all individuals\nand AOPs irrespective of their property income if they choose to pay applicable\ntaxes.\nEncouraging Foreign Remittances\n45. To encourage foreign remittances, it is proposed that withholding tax on\ncash withdrawal or on issuance of banking instruments / transfers from a domestic\nbank account to the extent of remittance amount received from abroad in such\naccount in a year may be exempted.\nPromoting Investment in Overseas Pakistanis Savings Bills\n46. To promote investment in Overseas Pakistanis Savings Bills by individuals,\na new debt instrument is being issued by State Bank of Pakistan on the pattern of\nSCRA. It is proposed that tax exemption may be provided to such NRAR accounts.\nCentralized Income Tax Refunds\n47. Presently, income tax refunds are verified, processed and issued manually\nthrough a refund voucher to be signed by the respective officers in the relevant field\nformation. This system is outdated and prone to corruption due to manual process\ninvolving contact between the taxpayer and the refund issuing tax officers.\nTherefore, to promote transparency and induce efficiency in the manner of issuance\nof income tax refunds, it is proposed that issuance of centralized Income Tax\nrefunds may be enabled.\nExemption Granted to Hajj Operators\n48. To facilitate Hajj Group operators, they are proposed to be exempted from\nthe requirement of deducting tax under section 152 whilst making payments to nonresidents.\nExplanation Regarding Vehicles Up to 200cc Excluded from the Ambit of\nAdvance Tax\n49. To prevent incidence of tax on lower strata of society, an explanation is\nproposed to be added to the definition of “motor vehicle” so that it is clarified that\nadvance tax u/s 231B and 234 is not liable to be collected on motor vehicle/small\nprivate vehicle up to engine capacity of 200 cc. The explanation aims to provide\nrelief to the lower strata of the society.\nTax Collection against Auction to be collected in Installments\n50. Currently, the advance tax under section 236A is to be collected “at the time\nof sale of auction”. The intent of the law regarding collection of advance tax in\ninstallments from purchaser can be discerned from subsection (3) of section 236\nwhich allows installments in case of immovable property. However, in order to\nremove ambiguity an explanation is proposed to be inserted to clarify that the\nadvance tax u/s 236A is collectable in installments.\nEnhancement of Turnover Threshold to Make AOPs or Individuals\nWithholding Agents for Deduction u/s 153(1)\n51. Currently every prescribed person is required to withhold tax at the time of\npayment for sale of goods; or providing or rendering of services; or execution of\ncontract. In case of individuals and AOPs, “prescribed persons” are those having\nturnover of Rs. Fifty Million or above. In order to provide relief to small taxpayers\nand to promote ease of doing business, the limit of turnover is proposed to be\nenhanced from Rs. 50 million to Rs. 100 million.\nPrompt Issuance of Exemption Certificates\n52. For the ease of doing business, and to facilitate public listed companies and\npoint-of-sale (POS) Integrated Enterprises, it is proposed that facility may be\nprovided to such entities of obtaining exemption certificate within fifteen days of\nfiling of application failing which the certificate will be automatically issued\nthrough the system.\nNegotiated Assessment\n53. Currently, there is no mechanism in place to resolve a dispute before\nfinalization of assessment. It is, therefore, proposed that where a taxpayer is of the\nopinion that the assessment intended to be amended is not in accordance with the\nprovisions of law or facts of the case, he may approach the Assessment Oversight\nCommittee for resolution of his dispute. Enabling negotiated assessment will\nfacilitate taxpayers and prevent revenue from being stuck-up in litigation.\nStrengthening Alternate Dispute Resolution Mechanism\n54. To promote the use of alternate dispute mechanism and reduce litigation, it\nis proposed that the decision of ADRC may not be binding upon the aggrieved\nperson. The ADRC’s decision will become binding only when the aggrieved person\nwill be satisfied with its decision.\nStreamlining Mechanism of Exemption\n55. To clearly delineate criteria for grant of exemption certificates under\nvarious withholding tax sections, the mechanism of exemption is proposed to be\nstreamlined. This mechanism includes elimination of certain discriminatory\nexemptions. Further, in the interest of ease of doing business, the facility of\nobtaining exemption certificate against certain withholding taxes collected as\nadvance tax under Chapter XII is proposed to be extended to such persons who\nhave discharged their advance tax liability for the tax year.\nEducational Institutions\n56. To increase deter noncompliance to laws, it is proposed that persons not\nappearing on ATL may be subjected to 100% higher rate of tax deducted by\neducational institutions on annual fee exceeding Rs. 200,000/-\nIncentivizing Development REIT Scheme\n57. To incentivize development and construction of residential building through\nREIT scheme, profit realized from sale of immoveable property is exempted from\ntax if sold with object of development and construction of residential buildings till\n30th June 2020. It is proposed to be extended until 30th June 2021.\nProposals for Taxation of PEs of non-residents Tax Treatment of PEs with Respect to Services\n58. Services are subject to deduction of advance tax at the rate of 8% but certain\nsectors are liable to deduction at reduced rate of 3% due to low profit margin.\nHowever, PE of non-residents have not been provided this benefit, which appears\ndiscriminatory. Therefore, to remove the distortion and bring about parity between\nPEs of non-residents and resident taxpayers, the rate of deduction of advance tax\non these services is proposed to be 3% for PEs of non-residents.\nConcessions to Special Economic Zones\n59. To encourage setting up of enterprises in SEZs and to stimulate investment\nand manufacturing, it is proposed that concession and exemptions available to the\ndevelopers of SEZs may be extended to co-developers.\nReduction in Rate for Toll Manufacturing\n60. At present, the rate of tax on toll manufacturing is 8%. It is proposed that\nthe rate may be specified at 4% for companies and 4.5% in other cases. This\nmeasure would ensure that effective tax rate is not unreasonably higher than the\nnormal tax rates.\nStreamlining Applicability of the Tenth Schedule for Non-resident and PE of\nNon-resident\n61. For the sake of simplification of law and promoting ease of doing business,\nit is proposed that only PE may be subject to enhanced rate of tax deduction under\nthe Tenth Schedule even if the payment is received on account of sale of goods\nwhich did not make them liable for deduction under tenth schedule previously and\nnon-resident taxpayer as recipient of payment are to be exonerated from the\nprovisions of the Tenth Schedule.\nMeasures for Broadening of the Tax Base and Enforcement\nEnablers\nElectricity Expense Treatment\n62. As an attempt to broaden tax base, it is proposed that electricity expense\nmay be treated as an admissible business deduction subject to certain conditions.\nIndustrial Undertaking Supplying to Unregistered Persons\n63. To broaden tax base and encourage documentation it is proposed that\nbusiness expense under section 21 for an industrial undertaking making supplies to\nan unregistered person may be disallowed.\nMaintaining Information Integrity\n64. To ensure authenticity and integrity of registration information, it is\nproposed that updating and/or validation of taxpayers’ profiles be made a condition\nfor appearing on the ATL. The amendment will help in achieving and maintaining\ninformation integrity.\nReal-Time Access to Databases of Certain Organizations\n65. In order to consolidate tax relevant information from third party sources and\nto enable AI and analytics based automatic detection of tax evaders, it is proposed\nthat automatic and on demand information may be furnished through various\nentities to bolster efforts for broadening of the tax base.\nAutomated Adjusted Assessment\n66. The filing of return which is deemed as assessment by fiction of law has\ncreated technical complications. It is, therefore, proposed that the returns filed by\nthe taxpayers should be initially processed within six months of filing of return by\nmaking adjustments for any arithmetical errors, any incorrect claims, any\ndeductions, tax credits or losses which are not allowable under the Ordinance. Such\nprocessing is proposed to be done automatically through the system.\nAudit On the Basis of Benchmark Ratios\n67. To determine the real income of taxpayers, it is proposed that production\nand sales may be determined according to benchmark ratios and estimating\nrevenues. This is in line with the best international practices, and will help expedite\nassessment processes and bring efficiency to the system.\nE-Audit\n68. To make the process of audit more effective, it is proposed that e-audit\nassessment may be introduced. In addition, audit may also be conducted through\nvideo link and other online facilities.\nAdvance Tax Collection on Minerals\n69. To enlarge the scope of withholding and to monitor economic transactions\nby all persons in this realm, it is proposed that the collection of advance tax on\nminerals under section 236V may be extended to persons on the ATL.\nMeasures for Removal of Distortions\nFacilitating Banks\n70. Currently, there are different rates applicable with respect to profit on debt.\nHowever, banks do not have the required mechanism to impose differential rates\non persons receiving aggregate profit on debt of up to Rs 500,000 per annum and\nabove. Therefore, a uniform rate of 15% is proposed for withholding tax on profit\non debt.\nMinimum Tax on Permanent Establishments of Non-Resident Persons\n71. Minimum tax under section 113 is currently levied on resident companies,\nindividuals and AOPs. Therefore, persons other than resident companies, AOPs and\nindividuals fall outside the ambit of minimum tax. It is proposed that the scope of\nlevy of minimum tax be extended to persons other than resident individuals, AOPs\nand companies.\nRationalization of Cost of Transport Vehicle for Deduction for Business\nIncome\n72. In certain cases, costly vehicles are taken on lease and heavy deductions are\nclaimed to reduce tax incidence. An amendment is, therefore, proposed to introduce\nan upper limit of Rs. 2.5 Million on cost of transport vehicles not plying for hire.\nInternational Best Practices\nRationalizing Depreciation Deduction Based On the Half Year Rule\n73. To discourage the practice of purchasing assets at the year end and claiming\nfull year’s depreciation, it is proposed that half-year rule for depreciation deduction\nas per international best practices may be introduced.\nBase Erosion Profit Shifting\n74. To prevent base erosion and profit shifting, it is proposed to limit deduction\nof interest expense to foreign affiliates as per recommendation of BEPS Action 4.\nFATF Requirements\nDonations to Certain Entities Exempted\n75. To ensure traceability of donations and to avoid money laundering, it is\nproposed that donations made to certain entities under clause (61) of the Second\nSchedule may be treated as exempt, subject to certain conditions w.e.f. 1.7.2020.\nIncome of Certain Entities Exempted\n76. To ensure that documentation requirements for NPO status are fulfilled, it\nis proposed that the income of certain entities under clause (66) of the Second\nSchedule may be exempted from tax, subject to fulfillment of conditions required\nfor hundred percent tax credit under section 100C of w.e.f. 01.07.2021.\nStrengthening Compliance Regime of Non-Profit/Welfare Organizations\n77. It is proposed that non-profit organizations (NPOs), trusts and welfare\ninstitutions, in order to be eligible for hundred percent tax credit may, also be\nrequired to file a statement of voluntary contributions and donations received in the\npreceding tax year. Further, the definition of ‘NPO’ may be amended to include\nonly such organizations under the ambit of the definition, provide activities for the\nbenefit of general public.\n78. Surplus funds of the NPOs, which are not spent during the year for welfare,\nare taxed at the rate of 10% with certain exclusions. One such exclusion is funds\nwhich could not be spent due to any obligation or restriction placed upon the NPO\nby the donor. However, where the donor is an associate of the NPO, such a\nrestriction can be a mechanism to shift profit to the NPO. It is, therefore, proposed\nthat the above exclusion may not apply in case the donor is an associate of the NPO.\nTechnical and Procedural Measures\nEnsuring Partial Realization of Demand\n79. To substantial demands being remain unpaid for a long period of time after\nfinalization of assessment it is proposed that after the appeal has been decided by\nthe first appellate authority, the second appeal before the Appellate Tribunal be\nmade conditional on payment of ten percent amount of tax demand upheld by the\nCommissioner (Appeals).\nPermission of the Commissioner for Revising Wealth Statement\n80.

Further, the revision\nmay be restricted to the time limit for amendment of assessment i.e. five years from\nthe end of the tax year to which it relates.\nFurnishing of Information for Computation of Advance Tax\n81. In order to automate the computation of advance tax through the IRIS\nsystem, it is proposed that the taxpayers be required to furnish information\npertaining to taxes deducted from them in a prescribed format so that the system\ncan automatically grant credit of taxes already paid by them and reduce advance\ntax liability to the extent of taxes already paid. Further, to enable the system to\nautomatically compute advance tax liability, it is proposed that such taxpayers be\nrequired to furnish, through IRIS system, their turnover for the quarter by the 5th\nday of the month in which advance tax is to be paid.\nAligning Holding Periods of Property for Capital Gains and Withholding\nTaxes\n82. To align the holding period of capital gain with the holding period for\ncollecting withholding tax, it is proposed that holding period for collecting\nwithholding tax on sale of property be reduced from five to four years in case of\nconstructed properties and the holding period for collecting withholding tax in the\ncase of open plots be increased from five to eight years.\nExemption from 100% Higher Withholding Rates for Non-Residents\n83. Due to treaty limitations, it is proposed that 100% higher rates for not\nappearing on ATL may be withdrawn in case of payments to non-residents for\nroyalty, fee for technical services, insurance premium, reinsurance premium and\nother payments.\nExtension of Presumptive Tax Regime for Persons Engaged in Business of\nShipping\n84.

Under the current law, a person whose income is subject to final tax is\nrequired to furnish a statement u/s 115(4) instead of a return of income u/s 114. In\norder to simplify the tax law for compliance purposes and to promote ease of doing\nbusiness, it is proposed that the statement declaring income subject to final tax may\nbe incorporated as a part of the return u/s 114(2).\nRevision of Prescribed Fee Structure for Appeals Filed to Commissioner\n(Appeals)\n86. The prescribed appeal fee structure has been static since the Finance Act,\n2009. Therefore, to account for inflationary impact, it is proposed that for\ncompanies the rate may be increased to Rs. 5,000/-; for other cases (if appeal is\nfiled against assessment order) to be Rs. 2,500/-; whereas, in all other cases, it may\nbe specified at Rs. 1,000/-.\nRevision of Prescribed Fee Structure for Appeals Filed Before the Appellate\nTribunal\n87. The prescribed fee for appeals against the orders of the Commissioner\n(Appeal) is Rs. 2,000/-. The fee structure has not been revised since the Finance\nAct, 2009. Therefore, to account for inflationary impact, it is proposed that the\nprescribed fee may be enhanced from Rs. 2, 000/- to Rs. 5, 000/- in case of\ncompanies and specified at Rs. 2, 500/- in all other cases.\nExplanation Regarding Renewal of Licenses and Payment By Installments In\nCase of Sale Of Property By Auction\n88.

Section 236 requires collection of advance tax at the time of sale by public\nauction or auction by tender of any property. Award of lease including lease of the\nright to collect tolls has been incorporated in the Ordinance for purpose of\ncollection under subsection (1). The same is treated final tax on transaction. Income\ntax is direct tax which is charged on actual income arising from transaction and its\ncollection in indirect mode on transaction is required to be phased out.
