  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 12 (APP):The government has planned to make a considerate effort to address the freight share imbalance between road and rail sectors through provision of adequate funding for the Rail sector with focus to improve the reliability and time efficiency for the railways. The project of ML-I upgrdation under CPEC\nframework will be implemented, said a budgetary document released on Friday.\nAccording to Annual Development Plan, multimodal and integrated system of transport will be\ndeveloped to economize the cost of traveling and improving the system. A significant shift of freight towards railways to achieve optimal utilization of its inherent capacity would be necessary to reduce relative transportation costs. The benefits would be maximized if roads become a preferred means of transport for high-value and short-haul freight and\nRail Network for long-haul and heavy cargo. The National Transport Policy , 2018 would pave the\nway for betterment of the Transport network of Pakistan. An integrated systems approach will be developed during the Plan to ensure improved performance of the National Transportation Network. On the one hand, maximum stress will be laid on optimal utilization of the existing capacity of the system by rehabilitation and better maintenance of assets as well as enforcement of efficient operational techniques and managerial practices; on the other, capacity expansion will follow the\noptimal intermodal traffic allocation.\nAvailability of required financing for the infrastructure projects has been a problem area, since huge capital costs are involved. While sufficient PSDP allocations are provided, the available resources cannot meet the demand fully, therefore, government is pursuing new and alternative modes of financing primarily Public Private Partnership and Build\nOperate-Transfer modes.\nUnder Ministry of Communications; an allocation of Rs110.4 billion has been made for NHA, while National Transport Research Centre has been allocated Rs0.075 billion.\nAn allocation of Rs110.4 billion has been made for NHA. Priority has been given to ongoing projects and new important projects have been included in NHA’s portfolio.\nThe Government, cognizant of the importance of the Transport systems,is investing large\namounts of human and financial resources into the development of the transport sector. Such investments are being supported through foreign funding / investments envisaged in China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) programme, the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation (CAREC) programme and other foreign-assisted initiatives. Further,\nwork on innovative modes of investments such as Public Private Partnership has been initiated and\nthe projects having high financial rate of return are being explored and initiated for procuring financing through these\ninnovative methods.\nIn PSDP 2019-20 provided an outlay of Rs184.7 billion for federal programme under transport and logistics sector. Against this, an expenditure of Rs229.1 billion is expected to be incurred by the end 2019-20, giving an overall utilization of 124 percent . The expenditure over and above, allocated amount is due to the foreign aid disbursements more than\nanticipated in case of NHA foreign funded projects.\nAgainst an allocation of Rs12.2 billion for 26 schemes of Railways, an expenditure of Rs8.3 billion is\nexpected to be incurred during 2019-20, giving utilization of 68 percent. The focus was on the\nimprovement of existing infrastructure, signalling system, and procurement and manufacture of\nrolling-stock like locomotives including high horse powers locos, coaches, and bogie wagons.\nUnder Ministry of Communications; six schemes of National Transport Research Centre (NTRC),\nRs0.09 billion were allocated against which an expenditure of Rs0.09 billion has been incurred by\nthe end of 2019-20. 84 schemes of NHA were allocated Rs154.9 billion against which an\nexpenditure of Rs207.6 billion has been incurred by the end of 019-20, showing utilisation of\nabout 133 percent. The over and above expenditure is due to foreign aid disbursement of\nRs112.76 billion against the allocated amount of Rs58.9 billion.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
