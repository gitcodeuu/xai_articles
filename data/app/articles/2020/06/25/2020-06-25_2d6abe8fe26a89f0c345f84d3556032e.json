  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 25 (APP):Prime Minister Imran Khan Thursday pointed out that Pakistan’s economy had been improving prior to the coronavirus pandemic, duly recognized by international credit rating agencies, in addition to the surging exports at a fast pace.\nSpeaking on the budget in the National Assembly, he said exports of\nPakistan had been rising, on month-on-month basis, at the fastest rate\nearly this year and added international agencies had rated Pakistan at\nB3, which was recognition of the country’s improving economy at that\ntime.\nHe said the lockdown had negative repercussions for the economy in\nPakistan, while strict lockdown imposed by India, had an adverse effect\non its economy.\nHe pointed out that rate of coronavirus infections was still higher in India\nas compared to Pakistan and people in cities like Mumbai, were forced to\nwait outside hospitals to get treatment against coronavirus.\nThe PM said in India, 34 percent of the population had gone below the\npoverty line in the wake of lockdown. Millions of people were out on the\nroads to find work and to make ends meet when measures for a lockdown\nwere taken, he added.\nHe said due to coronavirus, the world was in recession and countries\nsuffered losses of $ 12 trillion; many industries were closed down permanently; services sector particularly tourism and airline industry suffered immense losses and the world still did not know how long the economic crisis would continue.\nHe said the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government inherited record level of\ncurrent account deficit as previously exports were stagnant at $ 20 billion while imports going upto $ 60 billion.\nThe high current account deficit showed that the country’s economy was sick,\nhe noted.\nHe further said the deficit put pressure on the dollar exchange rate which in turn made imports expensive, and that led to higher inflation which adversely impacted prices of utilities and commodities and increased poverty.\nThe total debt and liabilities went up from Rs 16000 billion to Rs 30000 billion\nduring the 10-year tenures of previous governments and PTI government in its the first year, spent half of the collected revenue on paying off installments of loans taken in the past, he explained.\nImran said the PTI government did not borrow from the State Bank while in\nthe past Rs six trillion were borrowed.\nHe said his government inherited circular debt of Rs 1.2 trillion and expensive\nelectricity and gas contracts. The gas purchase contract was for 15 years while now gas was available in the world at much reduced price, he added.\nHe said the Opposition should be asked why it wreak havoc with country’s\neconomy.\nThe Prime Minister said he led the austerity drive to set example for others,\ncut expenditure of the PM House and reduced to half its staff of 534. “We can\nfurther reduce the staff but we don’t want to put people out of work.”\nThe profile of government borrowing was changed as previously 70 percent\nof its borrowing was expensive and for short term but now 76 percent of the\nloans were taken on a long term basis, he added.\nHe said National Disaster Management Authority was given all the powers\nand the government would meet all its expenses to tackle locust which potentially could be very dangerous for the country.\nHe said National Command and Operation Center was regularly receiving\nreports from cities, towns and different parts of the country, monitoring all\nhotspots of coronavirus and cordoning off areas with high incidence of the\ndisease.\nIn order to relieve pressure from the civil administration, newly formed Tiger\nForce was given the task to enforce the standard operating procedures for\ncoronavirus, he said. “If we can spend one month with care, we can save ourselves from the ill-effects of coronavirus.”\nHe said Rs 30 billion were allocated so that people could get financing to\nbuild affordable houses at subsidized interest rates.",
