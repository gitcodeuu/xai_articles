It was a very comprehensive project in the areas of infrastructure development, energy, transport, and telecommunications.\nHe said that the CPEC was developing smoothly and mentioned the energy sector had helped Pakistan overcome its critical needs in energy sector.\nThe infrastructure had improved while Gwadar was progressing well which would not only help socio-economic development in Pakistan but it would also help regional integration.\n“We had shortage of electricity in last few years but now we are reaching a stage that we will have a surplus energy in Pakistan,” he added.\nWhile dismissing an impression that the CPEC projects were progressing slow, he said that since he came here, he had been meeting with Chinese entrepreneurs and companies who were already working in Pakistan and like to expand their footprints in Pakistan and get new projects and investment.\n“If there are problems with their projects, these companies would have not been keen to go to Pakistan,” he added.\nHe said that there were detractors of CPEC who didn’t like China’s rise and friendship between Pakistan and China so they were always opposing it.\nTo a question about negative environmental impact, he pointed out that Pakistan and China being signatory to the Paris climate accord attached great importance to international climate change.\n“All these projects being completed under CPEC framework conformed to the those international standards,” he added.\nHe said that the government attached great importance to the environment and launched mega projects like 10 billion tree plantation, clean and green Pakistan and in that respect even in the CPEC, projects were very carefully executed and it was ensured that it conformed to the international standards.\nOn Pakistan and China relations, he said that both the countries had very a special relationship which had been nurtured over the years by the successive governments and people of the two countries. “So, no wonder that we call each others as iron brothers.”\n“This expression that our relationship or friendship is higher than mountains and sweeter than honey, we will never find such a description of any other relationship in the world. So truly it is unique relationship. We stood together in good times and bad time.”\nAmbassador Haque informed that next year, both the countries would be celebrating 70 years of establishment of their diplomatic relations, adding, “We look forward to celebrating it with a very high quality and dozens of events which commensurate with special nature of relationship.”\nTerming his appointment as Pakistan’s ambassador to China as great honour, he said that he would be focusing on cooperation in the areas like agriculture, industrial, IT and tourism besides other fields during his tenure.\n“See how can we learn from Chinese experience and work together for a better future of the two countries in the new era as president Xi mentioned,” he added.\nAbout cooperation between Pakistan and China during COVID-19 pandemic, he said that the pandemic came as big crisis and challenge for entire humanity so Pakistan was no exception.\nHe said that Pakistan had to face difficult times but now the situation was stabilizing. The government had to create balance between controlling the pandemic and at the same time had to see that needs of poor people were met.\nSo, the government imposed smart lockdown and provided special packages to the business and health sectors and relief to poor people.\nPakistan, he said stood with China in wake of Covid-19 and sent plane loads of all necessary items in February this year which was much appreciated by Chinese government.\nHe said that in March this year, President Dr. Arif Alvi visited China to express solidarity with the government and people.\nWhen the pandemic started spreading in Pakistan, China helped in a big way by dispatching plane loads of medical supplies and equipment. Now both the countries were cooperating with each other for production of vaccine against Covid-19, adding, “We will have good news very soon.”\nAmbassador Haque appreciated President Xi’s statement that whenever the vaccine would be ready it would be accessible to developing countries.\nHe also lauded the Chinese support which helped Pakistan meet challenge of locust invasion. “With the support of China and resilience of Pakistani people and timely decisions and measures taken by government to safeguard interest of local farmers and agriculturists, Pakistan overcame the very difficult time.”\nAbout cooperation in the e-commerce sector, he said that Pakistan’s digital economy was progressing. “In our country, we have around 170 million mobile phone users which are almost 80 pc of our population while the internet has penetrated to a large extent.”\n“We are currently using 4G in our country but we are also conducting trials for 5G and we hope to be the first country after China to have 5G.

It was long outstanding issue and it was still on agenda of United Nations.\nThere were still dozens of UNSC resolutions calling for resolution of Kashmir issue through a plebiscite and in accordance with the wishes and aspiration of people of Kashmir.\n“But unfortunately, India has always refused to recognized centrality of the UN and UN resolutions and India has also rejected all the bilateral agreements between our two countries,” he added.\nHe said that last year in August, India took a unilateral and illegal decision about Kashmir and had gone through a brutal suppression of rights of people Kashmir through military siege which was still continued today. India which claimed to be a so-called largest democracy had never accepted rights of people of the Kashmir.\nAmbassador Haque said that it was time for the international community to raise its voice to tell India to resolve this issue through peaceful means and dialogue and on basis of UN resolutions.\nTo a question about peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan, he said that Afghanistan was very close friend of both Pakistan and China.\nHe pointed out the situation in Afghanistan during last four decades had impact on the peace and stability of the entire region while Pakistan was greatly affected by the situation in Afghanistan.\nHe said that Pakistan and China were contributing to peace and reconciliation process in Afghanistan which was Afghan-led and Afghan-owned.\n“We will always stand by people and government of Afghanistan as they move forward to charting their future,” he added.\nHe said that talks going on in Qatar were historic and both Pakistan and China supported this political settlement and process. Now the leadership and people of Pakistan should seize this historic opportunity for peace, progress and stability in Afghanistan.\nAbout the US-China relations, he said, “What is important is that we cooperate with each other. We do not seek hegemony between us and we do not take unilateral actions.”",
