But she accepted the disease to tear down the taboo and treat it like any other disease.\nShe said a minor lump in the breast could prove fatal if ignored out of shame or negligence.\nBrigadier Dr Nadeem Paracha of Army Medical Corps, while highlighting the military’s health services and contributions, said the institution planned to establish 10 state of the art breast cancer diagnosis and treatment facilities across the country.\nHe said instead of establishing a few cancer hospitals, every hospitals must have the treatment facility and every doctor must be educated on the subject.\nGroup Captain Dr Munazza of Pakistan Air Force said the PAF had been extensively running free medical and awareness camps on the disease.\nDr Asim of Shaukat Khanum Hospital also shared with the audience the statistics, treatment and research support by the SKMH, a specialized facility.",
