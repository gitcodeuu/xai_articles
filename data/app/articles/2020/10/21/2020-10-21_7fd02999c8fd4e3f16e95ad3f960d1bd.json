  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 21 (APP): Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Youth Affairs Usman Dar on Wednesday said Sindh government itself mishandled the issue of Inspector General of Police (IGP).\nTalking to a private TV channel, he said the situation would be cleared after the completing of inquiry about the matter.\nThe SAPM said the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) never respected the constitution because they did not believe in supremacy of law in the country, adding its leadership had always violated the constitution.\nReplying to a question, he said PML-N invited the Army to resolve the political issues been faced by them and afterwards they criticise the institution for intervening in political matters.\nPML-N casted votes in favour of the extension of the Army chief’s service and now they have started to malign the institution as Nawaz Sharif was criticising the national institutions and had adopted the narrative of Pakistan’s enemies, he added.\nUsman Dar said the government was committed to bring Nawaz back to the country.",
