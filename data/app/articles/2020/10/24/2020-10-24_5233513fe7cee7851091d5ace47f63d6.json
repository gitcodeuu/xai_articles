If UN fails to deliver, its fate would be no different than the League of Nations,” he said and warned that the failure of League of Nations had led to World War.\n“It seems that the United Nations has forgotten what it was founded for.

Why is FATF forgetting the contribution of Pakistan in maintaining world peace, given Pakistan is the biggest contributor of peace in peacekeeping missions”. He said Pakistan has been hosting …\nAfghan refugees for 40 years now, has been treating them as their own. While on the other hand India is heading towards creating a huge refugee influx/ crisis, declaring majority of Muslim indians as non citizens while launching Ghar wapsi program to bribe Minorities against their properties and life security.\nHe said the developed nations will be responsible for any nuclear clash that will happen between India and Pakistan. Because that is what both states are heading towards.\nHe said Pakistanis need to unite against Indian forces, RAW and Modi has been conspiring against Pakistan, trying to exploit fault lines.\nHe urged the nation to show unwavering faith when it comes to Kashmir and fighting for Kashmiris’ right of self-determination.\nHe said that India will not see the dawn of black day in coming year, Kashmiris will get justice from International bodies because Imran Khan and his team is ready to go to every extent to liberate kashmir of Indian rule.",
