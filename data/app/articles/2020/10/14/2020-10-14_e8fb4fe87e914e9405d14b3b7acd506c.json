  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 14 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday rejected an instant representation of Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS) against an order of Wafaqi Mohtasib regarding violation of transparency and merit in appointment of a Draftsman (BS-14) and ordered an inquiry into appointment and structure of interview process.\nThe President ordered two report; an internal inquiry into the case of appointment and also on the structure of interview process at PIMS, required to be submitted to Wafaqi Mohtasib within 45 days. at PIMS, required to be submitted to Wafaqi Mohtasib within 45 days.\nWhen I was a student I remember selective preferences of unscrupulous examinres being reflected in the viva/interview process, wherein real merit was skewed. Therefore all my life, including in FCPS I have insisted on structured, objective interviews to remove bias. Lets be fair. https://t.co/LlpkLO8Y4u\n— Dr. Arif Alvi (@ArifAlvi) October 14, 2020\nThe candidate Asim Hanif, who had applied for the post of Draftsman against the vacancies advertised by PIMS, topped the list while obtaining 63 marks in written examination, but was not selected finally after the Interview Committee awarded him six (06) marks out of 30.\nFeeling aggrieved, the candidate had approached the learned Wafaqi Mohtasib and the hearing of the case was held on September 30,2020 with Dr. Minhaj us Siraj, Joint Executive Director along with Jameel Shirazi, Deputyy Director appearing on behalf of PIMS, while Asim Hanif appeared in-person.\nThe perusal of record revealed that the educational qualification of candidate Asim Hanif was B-Tech (Hons) along with Diploma of Associate Engineer. On the other hand, the selected candidate, who was a matriculate with a Diploma of Associate Engineer, got 48 marks in written examination while 25 out of 30 marks were awarded to her by the Interview Committee.\nThe Wafaqi Mohtasib, in its earlier order, had held that “During hearing it was revealed that the complainant has been put on disadvantage position by pulling him down in the merit given him only 6 marks in Interview, although he had topped in the initial screening test. The selected candidate scored 15% less marks from the complainant, but, was pulled up, given her maximum marks in the interview.”\nThe order of the Wafaqi Mohtasib was issued in light of an Office Memorandum of Establishment Division that emphasized upon ensuring transparency and merit while making appointments.\nThe order added: “Both candidates possessed same qualification/experience/diplomas. In guidelines provided by the Establishment Division in its Office Memorandum No.F.53/1/2008-SP dated 16th January, 2015.\nThe interview marks, however, are divided objectively and not subjectively, based on relevant, knowledge, experience and other communication skills.\nIn this case, the guidelines have been violated, and maladministration has been observed in bringing a candidate from bottom to top and pulling the top most candidate (complainant) at merit position No.2, awarding him only 6 out of 30 marks.”\nThe Wafaqi Mohtasib in view of the maladministration established against PIMS accepted the complaint of Asim Hanif and declared the interview process done as “null and void”. Also, it directed constitution of Interview Committee afresh with different composition.\nIt emphasized that interview process is not meant to exclude the meritorious candidates and select the candidates of lesser merit amounting to abuse of the process.\n“Such an assessment of a candidate by the Interview Committee is totally unfair and biased constituting maladministration as a candidate scoring the highest marks in the written examination cannot be so incompetent to get even the passing marks in the interview.\nArticle 2(2) of the Establishment of the Office of the Wafaqi Mohtasib (Ombudsman) Order I983 defines maladministration to include a decision which is unreasonable, unjust, biased or discriminatory. The learned Wafaqi Mohtasib has found it a matter of maladministration and quashed the interview process and directed that the Interview Committee be constituted afresh for interviews,” it said.",
