Sadly, society votes the political thieves into positions of power!” he added.\nHe said that ironically police catches ordinary thieves, but the same police ends up protecting and serving the political thieves. “Silly part of the entire issue is that society fights ordinary thieves but ends up fighting each other for the political ones” he said.",
