  "content": "RAWALPINDI, Oct 29 (APP): The Pakistan military Thursday rubbished a recent political statement on the release of a captured Indian air force pilot as an attempt to “distort history” and tarnish Pakistan’s success against the Indian aggression.\nDirector General Inter-Services Public Relations (ISPR) Major General Babar Iftikhar said India was taking undue advantage of this negative narrative to discredit Pakistan of its successful strike and retaliation to the Indian misadventure on February 27 last year.\nMajor General Babar Iftikhar said the the objective of one-point agenda press conference was to correct the facts.\nFormer Speaker National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq on Wednesday in a statement made at the National Assembly claimed that Pakistan agreed to return the captured Indian Air Force Pilot Wing Commander Abhinandan as it feared an attack by India, in February last.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan had announced the release of the felled Indian aircraft as a “goodwill gesture.”\nHowever the DG ISPR, without naming anyone said interpretations about release of Abhinandan were misleading and tantamount to discrediting the country’s victory over India.  He said India was taking undue advantage of the negative narrative as evident from today’s its media coverage and hype.\nHe said the superiority of Pakistan Armed Forces was acknowledged not only globally but also by the Indian military leadership. The release of Abhinandan was a responsible decision taken by the national leadership.\n“…we gave them [Indian forces] a bloody nose and it still hurts”\n“…we gave them [Indian forces] a bloody nose and it still hurts.”\nDG ISPR said Pakistan’s armed forces that were already on high alert and gave a befitting response to India after its abortive attempt to strike inside Pakistani territory on 26 February 2019, on a purported training camp near Balakot.\n“The enemy aircraft that had entered Pakistan airspace to drop explosives escaped while dropping their payload on empty mountains in sheer panic after seeing our Shaheens,” Major General Babar Iftikhar said.\nHe said the armed forces and the country’s leadership were united in their objective to teach India a lesson. He said Pakistan responded to India in broad daylight.”\n“Not only we gave then a proper response, but also shot down two enemy war planes and captured Wing Commander Abhinandan.”\nHe said the enemy had thrust a hybrid war on Pakistan and it was incumbent on every citizen to act responsibly, and disown misleading narratives to promote national cause and unity.\nHe vowed that the Armed Forces of Pakistan would foil the nefarious designs of the enemy with the support of the nation.\n“Pakistan’s leadership and the Armed Forces are ready to tackle every challenge posed to national security.”\nLIVE #APPNews : DG ISPR Major General Babar Iftikhar addressing Press conference #Rawalpindi https://t.co/MAwVCYF35W\n— APP   (@appcsocialmedia) October 29, 2020\nMinister for Information and Broadcasting Senator Shibli Faraz in a strong reaction to the controversial remarks of PML-N’s Ayaz Sadiq about return of the captured Indian pilot Abhinandan, Thursday asked him to tender apology in the Parliament or get ready to face the legal action.\n“All other things are secondary and the national interest is supreme at this point of time. We will not put Ayaz Sadiq’s statement, which has pleased India, on back-burner,” he said while addressing here a news conference.\nHe said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader would have to extend apology to the nation in the Parliament for causing harm to the national interest by making anti-state statement that appeased India.\nAn old tweet by the DG ISPR announcing the downing of two Indian fighter aircrafts by Pakistan Air Force\nIn response to PAF strikes this morning as released by MoFA, IAF crossed LOC. PAF shot down two Indian aircrafts inside Pakistani airspace. One of the aircraft fell inside AJ&K while other fell inside IOK. One Indian pilot arrested by troops on ground while two in the area.\n— DG ISPR (@OfficialDGISPR) February 27, 2019\nThe statement by the former Speaker National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq drew a strong reaction from not only the government benches but also from the general public.\nAyaz Sadiq lied on the floor of the house to appease his corrupt masters & feed the false narrative of our enemies.\nHim & his masters are a disgrace to our great nation. We stand with our brave & valiant soldiers.\nThese sell outs will never be forgiven or forgotten.\n— Ali Haider Zaidi (@AliHZaidiPTI) October 29, 2020",
