He warned that the federal government must not take any action about Gilgit-Baltistan, which is harmful for the Kashmir liberation movement in any sense, and said that plebiscite in accordance with the UN Security Council resolutions was the sole solution to the Kashmir issue.\nThe Chairman Public Accounts Committee of AJK Legislative Assembly, Abdul Rashid Turabi lauded the efforts of Azad Kashmir President Sardar Masood Khan in highlighting the Kashmir issue with full courage, bravery and wisdom at the national and international level.\nHe said that President Masood played not only the role of ambassador of Pakistan and Kashmiris but also represented the entire Muslim Ummah.
