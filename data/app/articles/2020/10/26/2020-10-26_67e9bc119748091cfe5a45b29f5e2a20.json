It’s just Shameless”.\nHe said that on the other hand, Nawaz keeps urging soldiers of and civil service to refuse orders from their superiors.\n“This is outright sedition and revolt” he said, adding that “clearly, PDM circus wants anarchy and chaos to spite Prime Minister Imran Khan who will never allow them to get away through National Reconciliation Order (NRO)”.\n“It is now clear that the other beneficiary of this circus is Modi, already on his knees due to (-)10 per cent GDP growth and COVID mishandling” Ali Zaidi said.\nHe said that “Modi also failed to respond on border dispute”, adding that Prime Minister Imran Khan clear position and Pak-China principled stand has prevailed yet again.",
