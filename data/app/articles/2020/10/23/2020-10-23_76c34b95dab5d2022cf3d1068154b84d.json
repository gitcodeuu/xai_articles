All and sundry should condemn violating sanctity of Quaid-e-Azam’s mausoleum in future so that no one could dare repeating this.\nHe said he will not declare anyone as traitor but the narrative of Nawaz Sharif was inadvertently benefitting the enemies, he said.\nHe said the politics of hypocrisy has no more future and performance based politics would be encouraged from now onwards. We should maintain harmony among our ranks for making the country prosperous.",
