  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 19 (APP):Senator Faisal Javed on Monday said the government would not give national reconciliation ordinance (NRO) or compromise with the political leaders allegedly involved in corruption and money-laundering cases at any cost.\nSpeaking in upper house of the parliament, he said the opposition parties were trying to pressurize the government for getting NRO by holding public gatherings.\n“They have looted public money and should be accountable. Through these public gatherings, they just want to build pressure on the incumbent government to halt the ongoing accountability process against them but they are making futile efforts,” he added.\nHe said they were not well-wishers of the public and all doing so to get a relief from the corruption and money-laundering cases.\nHe said all corrupt political leaders were united against the transparent system in a bid to carry on their corruption.\nSenator Faisal Javed said from 2008 to 2018, they got loan four times higher then the past tenures.\nHe added, “As per law of the land, all these corrupt elements should be behind the bars.”\nHe made it clear that the present government was fully committed to take strict action against all corrupt elements without taking any political pressure of these agitations.\nCommenting on public gathering in Karachi by opposition parties, he said it was ‘weekend show’ as people from surrounding areas visited Karachi to spend their weekly holidays.\nHe added the participation of Karachiites was not even five percent as the locals fully rejected these corrupt elements.\nHe strongly condemned the violation of sanctity of the Quaid-e-Azam mausoleum in Karachi and added that all those involved in this unethical practice should seek apology from the nation over this sad incident.\nHe said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf was a true democratic party with 22 years track record of political struggle while all other political parties used undemocratic means to get powers.",
