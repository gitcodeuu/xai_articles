The session was moderated by Larry Madowo of the BBC.\nBringing the perspective of Pakistan to the table, SAPM Dr. Nishtar said, “The COVID-19 pandemic has shown like never before how critical health is to the security of each country. COVID-19 has threatened livelihoods and undermined food security.\nUltimately decades of progress have been lost which reinforces the need to build resilient poverty alleviation strategies that tackle multi-dimensional poverty.\nWith 134 policies, Ehsaas does that, which has helped us respond effectively to both the health and poverty aspects of the pandemic.”\nShe said, “After the outbreak of pandemic, the government in Pakistan has been extremely responsive working across all ministries to ensure a one government approach to health, poverty alleviation and ensuring an economic recovery that works for everyone.”\nAt the poverty event, the team of distinguished panellists seized the opportunity to accelerate action towards the goal of a resilient recovery post-COVID-19.\nThe wide-ranging discussions explored the obstacles to poverty reduction, including conflict and climate change, and focus on the path ahead for developing countries, emphasizing the urgent need for both the public and private sectors to initiate a long-term approach to the recovery.\nAll distinguished panellists underscored the need for collective action to ensure years of progress in poverty reduction are not erased, and that efforts to confront poverty caused by COVID-19 also confront threats that disproportionally impact the world’s poor at the same time – like conflict and climate change.",
