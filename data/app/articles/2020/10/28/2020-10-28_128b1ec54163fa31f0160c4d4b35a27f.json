  "content": "MULTAN, Oct 28 (APP):Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi on Wednesday said no Pakistani could even think of compromise on Kashmir and flayed the opposition for confusing people with irresponsible statements on the issue.\nQureshi took exception to the stance of former National Assembly speaker and PML-leader Ayaz Sadiq and categorically denied it. He said it was an irresponsible discourse on Ayaz Sadiq’s part.\nIn a statement, Qureshi said the PTI government was striving to unite the nation on the Kashmir cause but unfortunately some people had started narrating the Indian mantra against it.\n“They are misleading people about Indian Spy Kalbhushan Jadev issue as they did on Abhinandan,” he deplored and said “The opposition is uttering this all in misconception. It is also making Abhinandun issue controversial.”\nHe said: “We took the Parliament into confidence on intelligence based information wherein there was no mention of Abhinandan. The opposition should go through International Court of Justice (ICJ) verdict and Pakistan’s take on it.”\nHe stated Pakistan would not give an opportunity to India to take the issue to the ICJ again. The opposition had politicized every issue which was bemoaning.\nQureshi said it was none other than the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (OML-N), which had pushed the country to the grey list of Financial Action Task Force (FATF). It was a gift from the PML-N, he added.",
