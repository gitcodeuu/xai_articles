He said it was an issue of national security and there should not have been any debate on the matter in this manner.\n“Our armed forces are defending the motherland bravely and we are indebted to soldiers for their supreme sacrifices for the country,” he remarked.\nThe MPA said Pakistan was the sole country which had defeated terrorism on its land.\nHe paid tributes to the armed forces, police and other law enforcement agencies for restoring peace in the country by eliminating terrorism.\nMeanwhile there have been reports of protests against the remarks by former Speaker National Assembly Ayaz Sadiq from many parts of the country.\nProtest in District Bolan:",
