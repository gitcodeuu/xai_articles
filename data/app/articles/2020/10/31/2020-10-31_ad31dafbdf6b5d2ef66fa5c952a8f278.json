It was also the responsibility of Opposition to work for development of the country,” he stated.\nTo another question regarding accountability, the minister said after Pervaiz Musharraf, the Pakistan Muslim League-N and Pakistan Peoples Parties had been in power.\nGhulam Sarwar Khan said that both the parties had failed to carry out accountability process during their period of running government.
