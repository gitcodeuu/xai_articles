The Board of Governors was notified on 26th July 2019.\nWith the prevalent practice of violence against women, one of the Ministry’s first priorities was to draft a domestic violence bill.\nThe report also shows that the Legal Authority Act 2019 also provides for the provision of legal aid to indigent and deserving women.",
