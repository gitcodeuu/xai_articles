He directed the district administrations across the province to ensure implementation of SOPs in marriage halls, educational institutions and public places.\nThe minister said that due to effective measures taken by the government, Punjab was close to defeating corona so people should show responsibility and protect themselves and others from the deadly pandemic.",
