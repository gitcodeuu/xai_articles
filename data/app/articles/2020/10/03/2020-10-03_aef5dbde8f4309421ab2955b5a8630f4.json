The Ministry of Education also set up a distance learning department to impart education during those times.\nHe said the government would keep this department working for future as well, as the online system had proved very effective.\n“We are looking forward to listen and solve problems being faced by the universities,” he said and added that providing support to the universities was vital for running its affairs smoothly.\nShafqat Mehmood said that establishment of new universities was a need of the hour, however there was also a requirement to look into faculty development as setting up a university was not only meant for constructing a building rather qualified faculty and standard of education was utmost necessary for promotion of education.\nCommenting on students’ unions in the universities, he said that the government was principally in favour of such extracurricular activities. But, on the same time, it had also to ensure that campuses did not become a hub of political clashes between different groups. The government was taking the matter serious and would take all the stakeholders including students, teachers and parents on board for finding out a better way out.\nHe said Pakistan had been facing many challenges including extremism and the armed forces of Pakistan were playing a leading role to eliminate the menace from the country.\nDuring this time, he said every Pakistani should stand in support of the valiant forces, instead of criticising them for the sake of political benefits as some political elements were doing so.\nThe minister said making the armed forces controversial was equal to weakening roots of the country and it was very unfortunate that some elements were indulged in it.",
