But Nawaz Sharif and his family received Modi at their Jati Umra palace.”\nShowing Maryam Nawaz picture with Indian steel tycoon Sajjan Jindal in Murree to the media, he said how would the PML-N leadership justify their close relationship with Narendra Modi and others, who have been guilty of manslaughter of Indian and Kashmiri Muslims.\nHe said Nawaz Sharif donned the red turban, a gift from Narendra Modi and released pictures in order to show his love for Narendra Modi.\nHe said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif held a clandestine meeting with Narendra Modi in Kathmandu (Nepal), adding that he would have to be answerable for his meetings with Sajjan Jindal and the other Indians.\nWarning Nawaz Sharif against anti-Pakistan rhetoric from London, Gill said the PML-N leader should not follow in the footsteps of former Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) leader Altaf Hussain, adding that the government was well aware of Nawaz Sharif’s meetings inside embassy of a country in London.\nAbout Nawaz Sharif’s allegations against Asim Saleem Bajwa, he said the government was satisfied with Bajwa and if somebody had any reservations, he might go to the court.\nHe said Sharif nurtured bad-blood against Bajwa as he arrested Kulbhushan Jadhav, adding that Nawaz must respond why he forbade the then Pakistan ambassador to India to issue any statements against India and the then Information Minister Pervaiz Rasheed did not want to hold a press conference on Kalbhushan’s arrest.\nResponding to media men, he said the government had nothing to do with Nawaz’s intentions whether he wanted to become Altaf Hussain or not, adding that the PML-N leader looted the public money and he must account for it.\nGill said that Nawaz Sharif was a habitual imposter, who would start speaking against the institutions whenever he was caught for corruption.\nTo a question about opposition protests, Gill said the opposition would be given a free hand as long as it maintains law and order and did not damage the public property.\nTo another query, the SAPM said why the Sharifs did not ask their sons to come to the country and launch a movement, and instead were calling upon the public to hold demonstrations and rallies.\nAbout the PML-N MPAs, he said it is their right if they wanted to meet the government authorities for the public works in their constituencies.\nHe said that 32 PML-N MPAs contacted him when he worked with Punjab Chief Minister Sardar Usman Buzdar.\nAbout Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) embargo, the SAPM said it was due to the writ petition of a citizen that PEMRA, not the government, stopped television channels from airing Nawaz Sharif’s speech. ‘Patriot Pakistanis will take care of Nawaz Shairf’s anti-Pakistan rhetoric themselves as they had done with Altaf Hussain,” he added.\nTo another question, Shahbaz Gill said that Nawaz Sharif and his family had personal business relations with the Indians and they benefit from these contacts, adding that why the Sharifs had not taken Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) leader Allama Tahir ul Qadri to the court when he had exposed their Indian connections.",
