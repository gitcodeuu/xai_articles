They were given cards and would soon be honored with certificates for their services they had rendered during the pandemic.\nHe said the tiger force was part of the Kamyab Jawan Programme that encompassed social engagement of the youth, in addition to their financial empowerment.\nThe SAPM also appealed the media and public to play their due role in curbing the hoarding and artificial inflation by pointing out them in their respective areas.\nTo a query, he said the CRTF were joined by the supporters of other political parties, dispelling the impression that it belonged to a particular political party.\nThe tiger force was formed in March following Covid-19 outbreak in the country to aid the civil administration to carry out coronavirus related activities.\nLater on, it was assigned additional duties related to tree plantation drive, anti-dengue and anti-polio campaigns, locust surveillance, traffic management, flood prevention and control, and other issues that require more human resource.",
