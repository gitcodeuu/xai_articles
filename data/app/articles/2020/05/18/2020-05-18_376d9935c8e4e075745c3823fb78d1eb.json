The payment of dues would be linked to the payment of salaries to the journalists and media workers by the media houses.\nThe government was planning to evolve a mechanism so that the media workers should not face such problems in future with timely payment of their dues, he added.\nThe minister said the quota of government advertisements for regional newspapers was imperative as many eminent journalists had emerged from small newspapers.\nThe minister said transparency would be ensured in the affairs of Audit Bureau of Circulation (ABC). He also assured that the problems of news agencies would be resolved.\nHe said another meeting with the CPNE would be held after Eidul Fitr to decide the matters with consensus.
