He added that the spread of coronavirus could only be minimised when people would prefer to stay at home.\nThe CM said that the government was monitoring the virus situation minutely, and that was why lockdown had been eased by realising the circumstances and economic hardships of the common man. He said that coronavirus pandemic threat was still there; therefore, we all would have to responsibly adopt precautionary measures. Failure in implementation of the standard operating procedures (SOPs) would invoke a legal action, he warned.\nHe said that people would have to act responsibly on the guidelines, issued by the government to cope with coronavirus pandemic. Those acting responsibly would stay safe, he added.\nPeople should not violate the precautionary measures if they wanted to help stop the spread of coronavirus. Protect yourself and others from coronavirus by staying at home, the CM added.",
