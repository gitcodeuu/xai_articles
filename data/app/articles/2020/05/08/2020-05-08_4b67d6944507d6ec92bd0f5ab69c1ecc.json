While in March and April, these birds migrate back to their places.\nHe said the flagship bird species include Crains, Flamingoes, Pelican, Houbara bustard and falcons species like Sakar and Peregrine while there are a number of other species too.\nAsif Khan said recently a record population of Flamingoes has been witnessed in the coastal areas of India.\nThe lockdown amid corona pandemic has provided relief to the migratory birds through reducing environmental pollution as well as the risks of hunting.\nHe said in Pakistan, a large number of birds fall prey to the illegal hunting by poachers every year due to the non-implementation of the national and international laws which prohibit this practice.\nThe lockdown has also reduced environmental pollution significantly, ultimately recovering the whole ecosystem.\nAsif Khan emphasized on enhanced coordination among wildlife departments and related organisations in the country for implementing conservation measures of migratory birds.\n“Every bird species has it’s own role in maintaining the better ecosystem but unfortunately only few popular or flagship bird species are focused in terms of conservation to attract more funding while other species which are equally important are neglected”, he lamented.\nTo a question regarding any activity planned for observing Migratory Bird Day, he said no such events have been planned to observe this day due to the prevailing situation in the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
