We have to open the lockdown with great prudence. The success of this phase is linked with public cooperation and discipline,” the prime minister said in his televised briefing following the meeting of National Coordination Committee (NCC) on COVID-19 chaired by him.\nThe meeting was attended by ministers for foreign affairs, economic affairs, information and broadcasting, federal education, aviation, industries and railway, advisors to the PM on finance and commerce, special assistants to the PM on health, information, overseas Pakistanis and social safety, and the National Disaster Management Authority chairman. The provincial chief ministers also joined the high level meeting through video link.\nAmong the major decisions made by the committee included reopening of small markets in localities and rural areas, allowing businesses to open after Sehri till 17:00 hours, opening of selective OPDs (outdoor patient departments) at hospitals and closure of educational institutions till July 15, 2020.\nBesides the prime minister, the cabinet members briefed the media about the decisions made in the meeting concerning their respective sectors.\nThe prime minister said the state’s biggest responsibility was to protect the poor people particularly in the prevailing tough situation. Even, the New York had decided to open up the construction industry despite having faced thousands of deaths due to COVID-19 pandemic, he added.\nHe, however, repeatedly advised the people to take all precautions at their workplaces and elsewhere to ensure their own protection and avert any sudden spike in the coronavirus cases.\n“We can overcome it only as a nation. We will not ask the police to enforce standard operating procedures (SOPs) by force and arrest the violators. I ask the Corona Tiger Force to make the people understand that this is in their own benefit… If it spikes suddenly, we will have to close down again which will ultimately make the poor suffer,” the prime minister remarked.\nThe prime minister said though the curve of COVID-19 cases was surging in Pakistan, the ratio was not as alarming as in other countries and for that the people must thank Allah Almighty during the holy month of Ramazan.\nHe was accompanied by his team members including Planning Minister Asad Umar, Industries Minister Hammad Azhar, Education Minister Shafqat Mahmood, National Security Advisor Moeed Yousuf and SAPM Sania Nishtar.\nImran Khan said being a responsible nation, the people must not let the poor face the burden of the crisis alone rather share it collectively.\n“This is time we act as responsible citizens and follow the SOPs. The countries releasing lockdown, have also announced some guidelines to be followed by the people.”\nHe said the government had already announced unprecedented relief packages for the construction industry as well as poor and unemployed people but it could not keep it up for long owing to already not-so-good economic condition of the country.\nThe prime minister said the government had spent its revenue on relief packages and facing 35 percent reduction in tax receipts besides decline in exports.\nHe said though the government’s relief package was far better than that of India yet it could not financially support every individual for long.\nThe government was receiving requests from restaurants and other sectors for opening as they were unable to bear any more loss.\nHe said the government had remarkably reduced oil prices bringing it to the lowest in the sub continent which would also help reduce the burden on the people.\nHe said soon after reporting of first coronavirus case in Pakistan, the government had announced lockdown across the country, closing all educational institutions and businesses to contain the swift-spreading of the virus.\nBut, the prime minister said he always feared the fallout of the lockdown on the daily wagers and the people associated with the informal economy.\nHe said after weeks long deliberations among the centre and provinces, the NCC decided to release the lockdown witnessing that the country was so far safe from West-like peak of the pandemic.\nHe said the government had already opened the construction industry in April and as per commitment, it had now decided to open the allied industries too.\nHe said the provinces were unwilling to open the public transport but contrarily, he desired so for it to be used by the poor people. He however, asked NCC to keep up coordinating with the provinces on the subject to help it revive.\nMoreover, the prime minister said around 125,000 Pakistanis were stranded abroad because the country lacked quarantine facility. He said the federal government was in talk with the provinces to allow self-quarantine to such people at their homes in what the federating units had apprehensions of any breakout if the people showed any negligence.\nHe said if allowed self-quarantine, it would be people’s responsibility to follow the guidelines to ensure protection of others particularly the elderly family members.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
