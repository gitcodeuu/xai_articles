  "content": "MIRPUR (AJK), May 12 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan has cautioned that the Indian rulers, BJP, and its ally RSS may carry out high-risk adventurism against Pakistan and the Kashmiris because they consider the situation arising out of the coronavirus as the most opportune for such recklessness.\n“The BJP-RSS regime is prepping for another “buccaneering salvo” against Kashmiris and Pakistan. Covid-19 cover would suit it for a misadventure. Make no mistake: we have not lowered our guard.” the AJK president said.\nCommenting on the threatening statements of the Indian rulers, the AJK president said in a statement on Tuesday that the incumbent Indian rulers, under a well-planned strategy, had fanned hatred against Muslims in India and Kashmir, and created such a situation that in the next phase, they can start ethnic cleansing and carry out the massacre of the Muslims on a large scale, and also attack Pakistan and Azad Kashmir.\n“India must know that 220 million Pakistani people who are actually defenders of their motherland are fully alive to its adventurous designs, and if India committed any foolish act, it will have to pay its heavy cost,” he said.\nHe, however, said Pakistan would give a befitting response to any Indian adventurism, and the people of both parts of Kashmir would take full advantage of the Indian foolish act and can inflict a severe blow on India.\nThe AJK president while fully supporting the call of the UN Secretary-General António Guterres for international action against those spreading hate speech in the world urged him to use his good offices and prevent Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his cronies from promoting anti-Muslim hatred in India and Kashmir.\n“UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres calls for global action against hate speech that has risen alongside the Coronavirus pandemic. I request, Mr Secretary General to make a special appeal to Indian leadership to cease hate speech against Muslims in India and Kashmiris,” Khan emphasized.\nHe said Indian ruling party BJP and its fanatic political and ideological ally sow the seed of hatred against the Muslims to eliminate them.\nThe AJK president warned the BJP and the RSS to pack up from the occupied Kashmir along with the equipment they use for terrorism in the territory, and said there was no concept of neocolonialism in the world now, and Kashmir which was the last symbol of neocolonialism, would also not remain an Indian colony for long.\n“The BJP-RSS must wrap up their apparatus of terror from Jammu and Kashmir and exit. All colonies have been freed. So should Kashmir, the last vestige of foreign occupation and colonial rule. You can’t survive as East India Company and the British Raj in Kashmir.” Khan asserted.\nSardar Masood Khan said the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir deserve sympathy and support from all freedom-loving and justice-loving nations of the world. Therefore, we expect that these nations and individuals will move forward to save the Kashmiri people form the Indian repression.\nStrongly condemning frequent violations of Line of Control by Indian occupation forces, and targeting of the civilian people of Azad Kashmir with heavy artillery, the AJK president called upon the international community to prevent India from creating a war-like environment in the region.\nHe expressed a deep sense of shock and grief over the martyrdom of a 20 years old girl Shauzia by the Indian Army firing at Rawalakot sector, and expressed sympathy with the bereaved family.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
