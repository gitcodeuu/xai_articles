Additionally, disinfection of aircraft will be ensured and no congestion at airports shall be allowed.”\nMeanwhile, in a separate press note the spokesman regretted that a section of media was reporting views differently from what had been stated in the news release.\n“The press release covers only outbound flights from Pakistan to foreign destinations,” he said, clarifying “the airlines may fly to Pakistan without passengers (ferry flight). They may carry passengers from Pakistan to international destinations.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
