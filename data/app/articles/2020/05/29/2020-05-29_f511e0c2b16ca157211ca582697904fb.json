Our peacekeepers have earned well deserved respect and goodwill for their professionalism and devotion to duty in every mission they have participated in,” she added..\nThe Spokesperson said, “Since 1960, over 200,000 of our servicemen have served with honour and distinction in 46 UN missions in 26 countries in almost all continents of the world. One hundred and fifty-seven of our gallant peacekeepers have made the ultimate sacrifice for the cause of international peace and security.”\n“Pakistan has also led the way in deputing female peacekeepers in a record time. In 2019, Pakistan met the 15 percent benchmark set by the UN Secretariat in the staff/ officers category. Our lady police officer Shahzadi Gulfam was the first ever recipient of International Female Police Peacekeeper Award in 2011,” she added.\n“Our contribution to peacekeeping on ground has been complemented by our sustained engagement in policy development in peacekeeping. We bring a unique perspective to peacekeeping as a leading troop contributing country as well as a host country to one of the oldest peacekeeping missions, UNMOGIP”, the Spokesperson maintained.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
