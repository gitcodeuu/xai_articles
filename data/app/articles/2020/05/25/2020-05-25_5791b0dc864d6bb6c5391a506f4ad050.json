Even it had to ban, entry of more vehicles after the number increased to capacity.\nDuring these holidays, the entry of tourists was banned in Murree in the wake of coronavirus pandemic, said Deputy Commissioner Rawalpindi Capt. ® Anwar ul Haq.\n“All the tourist spots and hotels in Murree would remain closed during Eid ul-Fitr holidays as part of precautionary measures against COVID-19,” he said.\nThe DC said the decision had been taken to control the spread of virus and in the best interest of people so that they could be saved from any life-threatening danger.\nHe urged the citizens to avoid visiting touring spots particularly Murree during the holidays.\nHe was of the view that the public rush at the tourist spots could cause further spread of the novel coronavirus.\nLast year, according to President of Kaghan Valley Hotels Association Saith Matiullah Naran and Kaghan valleys received 300,000 to 400,000 tourists during Eid holidays days from different parts of the country.\nThis time, tourism spots across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were closed throughout the holidays to avoid gatherings due to the coronavirus pandemic, Provincial Labour and Culture Minister Shaukat Yousafzai said.\nNaran, Kaghan, Swat and Murree are some of the most visited places in KP where locals as well as foreigners use to come for enjoying natural beauty.\nThe minister said keeping in view the current situation, all hotels were closed during Eid days in these areas.\nTalking to APP President of Kaghan Valley Hotels Association Saith Matiullah Naran and Kaghan requested the government to allow tourists to visit Naran and Kaghan as this was the only source of income for the locals who had to wait four to five month for visitors for this season.\n“We will follow the SOPs announced by the government for the safety and protection of the people, but they should be allowed to visit the areas as thousands of peoples’ bread and butter are with this activity” he added.\nNational Tourism Coordination Board Chairman Sayed Zulfikar Abbas Bukhari advised the citizens to avoid visiting tourist sites across the country during the vacations of Eid-ul-Fitr. “I know everyone loves to spend Eid holidays with their loved ones in Pakistan’s most beautiful places, however, this year we have still not yet opened our Tourism,” Zulfikar Bukhari said in a video message.\nFor travel enthusiasts, he also urged them to abstain from visiting tourist attractions, which were closed to stem spread of the coronavirus across the country.\nAn official of Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC) told APP that during in the Holy month of Ramazan “We have received thousands of calls for booking for hotels in Naran Kaghan but we refused as per the government policy.”\nAccordingly, he said, a message had also been placed at the PTDC’s official website that booking was closed due to the coronavirus.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
