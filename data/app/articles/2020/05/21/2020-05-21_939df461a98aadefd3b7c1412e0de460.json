He warned that if the Indian designs were not frustrated today, it will repeat the same exercise in Pakistan and Azad Kashmir also.\nWhile commenting on the worst Indian brutalities, the AJK president said the coward Indian Army lack the courage to fight the Pakistan Army. That was why he maintained that the occupation troops barge into homes of defenceless people and thrash women and children, and if the youth offer resistance, they were declared mujahids and secessionists and then either killed or put behind the bars.\nHe said India had frustrated to realize that the people of occupied Jammu and Kashmir were not ready to accept the actions of 5 August 2019, Hindutva philosophy, unlawful aggression and re-occupation of Kashmir by India.\nHe said under the garb of COVID-19, India had let loose a reign of terror against the Kashmiri people, but these tricks cannot deter the Kashmiri people from their goal because they will never accept anything less than their independence.\nAbout issuing domicile certificates to non-Kashmiri subjects, the AJK president asserted that these laws were designed to declare the Indian Hindus as the state subjects in order to annihilate the Muslim entity of Kashmir, and to turn Muslim majority into a minority.\nPaying homage to top Hizbul mujahideen commander, Junaid Sehrai, and his associate, Tariq Ahmed for offering the supreme sacrifice of their lives for the freedom of their motherland, President Khan said all the martyrs and their sacrifices were an asset for the liberation movement. He reiterated the Kashmiris’ resolve to accomplish the mission of their martyrs at all costs.\nHe called upon the international community particularly the UN Security Council and the OIC to take notice of the Indian attempts to flout the disputed status of Kashmir and play their role in ensuring restoration of internationally recognized right of self-determination of the Kashmiri people.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
