He dispelled the impression that the government was confused on lockdown and said the government would continue to take care of daily wagers and poor people.\nShahida Akhtar Ali while participating in the debate said that COVID-19 had affected the whole world and their economies.\nShe thanked Speaker National Assembly Asad Qaiser for constituting a parliamentary committee on COVID-19 and said suggestions put in it should be implemented to avoid spread of coronavirus in the country.\nShe asked the government to come up with a comprehensive strategy to deal with the coronavirus effectively. “The whole nation is looking towards Parliament for clear policy on the deadly coronavirus. It is responsibility of the elected representatives to help government in devising an effective policy on COVID-19.”\nShe said proper monitoring policy should be devised to check the relief activities across the country.\nShahid Khaqan Abbasi called on the federal government to lay out a comprehensive plan regarding official measures being taken to curb the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe said wearing of mask should be made compulsory for people visiting public places.\nMNA Salahuddin paid tribute to doctors, paramedics and hospital staff for staying and fighting in the frontline against the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe appreciated China for sending consignments of medical equipment to Pakistan.\nHe said businesses suffered losses due to the lockdown imposed in Sindh.

Pakistan failed to make adequate investments in the health sector in its 70 years history, he added.\nHe said provincial autonomy was guaranteed in the 18th amendment of the constitution and after devolution of powers, the responsibility of provinces had increased and they needed more financial resources not less.\nGhous Bux Mehr said politicians should stop bickering and concentrate on the fight against coronavirus.\nHe said it was not possible to provide food to people in their homes because of lack of resources.\nHe said power loadshedding should be avoided during Ramazan to give relief to the people.\nMoulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali said at present Pakistani students were satisfied with the conditions in China and felt more secure and wanted to stay there.\nMohsin Dawar said internet facility should be increased in the tribal areas. He said more testing facilities were needed to tackle the coronavirus.\nAndleeb Abbas said the world was working on a vaccine to treat the coronavirus.\n“We have to live with the coronavirus while protecting lives and livelihoods.”\nShe said the government was right in not bringing the students from China.
