However the deep sea port at Gwadar offers a much shorter rout for Afghan’s cargo.\nFirst cargo ship carrying containers for Afghan transit trade had arrived at Gwadar in January this year.\nThe port is a center part of the mega project of CPEC being executed with assistance of China to improve connectivity between the two countries in particular and with the whole region in general.\nCPEC is a multi billion project of around $60 billion which includes various projects such as construction of road and railway infrastructure, electricity projects, airports, special economic zones, agriculture, and the projects for socio-economic development of the local communities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
