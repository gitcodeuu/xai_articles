He said that investigation commission on the IPPs had not been formed yet, adding that action against the sugar and flour mafias had been delayed due to delay in the forensic reports on the request of the departments concerned.\nTo a question, he said that Shehbaz Sharif wanted to flee again, taking plea that the operation of Nawaz Sharif had been postponed due to coronavirus and he wanted to be with his brother.\nResponding to a question about former special assistant to the prime minister on information Firdous Ashiq Awan, he said she would now show up at the media from time to time, adding that he had no issue with anyone in the government.\nHe said that lockdown was not followed by anyone and it seemed to be a joke with the white-collar middle class citizens who had been deprived of their businesses due to lockdown. They were really worried as their small shops had been their only means of earning, which had currently been closed.\nHe requested the authorities concerned to allow the small shopkeepers to open their shops before Ramazan 1 so that they could do business like others and looms of Faisalabad and Gujranwala could be protected.\nHe said that millions of people were expected to fall below the poverty line in the upcoming few months due to coronavirus and unemployment would become a big issue in future.\nAbout Railways, the minister said that train operations could be restored in 24 hours if the prime minister ordered for it. He said that the PR would be able to pay salaries to its employees only for the next month, adding that financial help would be required for paying the salaries after that. He said that due to suspension of trains, the railways had to bear Rs 5 billion deficit per month.\nHe said that if train operations were restored, the number of passengers would have to be cut to half of the capacity to protect them from the virus, which would also be a big loss for the department.\n“I was planning to eradicate Rs 34 billion deficit of the Railways, but now it will be impossible,” he added.\nHe made it clear that not a single officer or worker of the Railways would be sacked due to coronavirus.\nAppreciating the role of Railways staff during the current coronavirus situation, he urged the Finance Department to upgrade one scale of all Railways employees, adding that it would improve performance of the railways. He said that the prime minister was himself working on restructuring of the Railways.\nThe minister thanked the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) for providing masks to the Railways workers. He said that one thousand markets would be made at the railway commercial land to meet the deficit of the Railways.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
