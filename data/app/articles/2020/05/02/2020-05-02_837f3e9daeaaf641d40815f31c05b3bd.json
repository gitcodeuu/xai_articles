  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 02 (APP):A senior Indian diplomat was summoned to register Pakistan’s strong protest over the ceasefire violations by the Indian occupation forces along the Line of Control (LoC) in Hajipir and Sankh Sectors, on May 1 which resulted in serious injuries to an innocent civilian.\nDue to indiscriminate and unprovoked firing by the Indian occupation forces, a 30 years old innocent woman, Nasreen Akhtar w/o Rafique, r/o village Khwaja Bandi, sustained serious injuries, Foreign office spokesperson said in a press release on Saturday.\n“Condemning the deplorable targeting of innocent civilians by the Indian occupation forces, it was underscored that such senseless acts are in clear violation of the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding, and are also against all established humanitarian norms and professional military conduct. These egregious violations of international law reflect consistent Indian attempts to escalate the situation along the LoC and are a threat to regional peace and security,” it said.\nIt was added that by raising tensions along the LoC and the WB, India could not divert attention from the grave human rights situation in the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJ&K).\nIndian side was called upon to respect the 2003 Ceasefire Understanding; investigate this and other such incidents of deliberate ceasefire violations and maintain peace along the LoC and the WB.\nThe Indian side was also urged to allow the United Nations Military Observer Group in India and Pakistan (UNMOGIP) to play its mandated role as per the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions.\nThe Indian occupation forces along the LoC and the Working Boundary (WB) have continuously been targeting civilian populated areas with artillery fire, heavy-caliber mortars and automatic weapons. In 2020, India has so far committed 940 ceasefire violations.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
