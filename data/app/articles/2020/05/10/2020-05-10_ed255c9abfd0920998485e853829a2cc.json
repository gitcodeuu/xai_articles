  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 10 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) President Sardar Masood Khan on Sunday said the Bharatiya Janata Party, the Indian occupation forces and intelligence agencies were hatching a plot against Pakistan and the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\nTaking advantage of the world’s focus on COVID-19 and diversion of attention from the ongoing genocide in Kashmir the occupation authorities had intensified killing of Kashmiri youth and escalated the situation along the Line of Control, he said in a statement issued by the AJK Presidential Secretariat\nThe AJK president said in the past month, they (occupation forces) had killed more than 40 young men in the Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IOJK) in staged encounters.\n“These are all extrajudicial killings and crimes against humanity”, said Masood Khan.\nHe said the occupation authorities, however, did not expect two reactions to their murderous campaign in the occupied territory. First, the Kashmiris, despite being under a nine-month old siege and COVID-19 lockdown came out in large numbers to openly protest against the Indian repression and scorched earth policy. “The uprising is reminiscent of the mass protests and boycotts by Kashmiris after the martyrdom of Burhan Wani in 2016,” he said.\nSecond, he said, the international media once again was shining a spotlight on Indian atrocities and killings.\nUnable to handle the two unforeseen developments, he said, the Indian army and intelligence high command had decided to shift blame to Pakistan by weaving weak suspicious stories that Pakistan was creating and funding new entities to fight the Indian occupation apparatus.\n“They know that the resistance is 100% indigenous”, he said, adding in addition to frequently violating the ceasefire along the LoC, the Indian intelligence hierarchy was making preparations for a false-flag operation, and wargaming to target different parts of Pakistan through proxy wars.\n“The Indian occupiers have started to play the victim once again. Pakistan should prepare to counter different forms of aggression by India that it is poised to unleash against Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. This includes sabotage, espionage and propaganda,” he said.\nSardar Masood said until recently the Indian authorities used to quote a figure of 230 indigenous “militants”. Now they reported a spike of an additional 350 and were talking about fictitious “launch pads” in Azad Kashmir. They were preparing the ground for more oppression, more aggression.\n“When you are pushed against the wall, you rise and reclaim what is yours. Victimhood paves the way for annihilation,” he said. “Kashmiris now say that enough is enough and have risen once again against unrelenting repression.”\nHe said the held Kashmir police buried the slain martyrs secretly and did not release their bodies to the families out of fear of massive funerals and demonstrations. “Now they are even scared of the dead bodies of Kashmiris. How are they going to deal with the living?” he asked.\nThe AJK president condemned the use of pellet guns, tear gas and live ammunition to quell protests in the IOJK. “Many would lose their eyesight. There would be blinding. There are fatalities,” he said.\nPresident Masood said while the international media and Zoom webinars had started highlighting the killing spree in the IOJK, the United Nations Security Council remained silent. It had not uttered a single word over the New Domiciles Rules introduced to colonise the Jammu and Kashmir territory and enslave its people.\n“It must be clearly understood that the killing spree in the occupied territory and the ceasefire violations along the LoC are designed to create a smokescreen to implement the vicious agenda of New Domicile Rules modelled on Hitler’s Nuremberg Laws. Kashmiris would be disenfranchised, displaced, forced out, massacred – all designed to create a Hindu Rashtra,” he added.\nThe AJK president said India was also flaunting irredentism.\nRecently, it had announced that it would include Gilgit Baltistan and Azad Kashmir in its weather bulletins. Though it was an outrageous development, Pakistan should include weather forecasts of the areas of Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir occupied illegally by India.",
