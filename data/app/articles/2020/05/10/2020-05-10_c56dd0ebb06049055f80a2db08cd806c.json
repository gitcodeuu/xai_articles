Pakistan has fully complied with the judgment and remains committed to continue doing so as the case proceeds further,” she stated.\nShe said Pakistan had granted India consular access to Commander Jadhav and was processing measures for effective review and reconsideration as per the guidelines provided by ICJ in its Judgment.\n“Being a responsible state, Pakistan abides by all its international obligations.
