Besides, provision of the medical supplies to every shelter home in the twin cities was a top most priority of the management to avert the virus outbreak.\nThe Focal Person said the shelter homes were being disinfected on regular basis. “The teams of the district administrations are playing leading role in sanitization of the ‘Panahgahs’, he added.\nPointing out an out of box solution to create awareness among the visitors on the coronavirus, he said large size radios were installed at each ‘Panahgah’ to directly communicate the health massages to daily wage earners who were less-educated.\nSpecial programmes on the COVID-19 were produced to broadcast on those radios daily, he added.\n“We have deputed teams to impart information to the staff of ‘Panahgahs’ on the coronavirus precautions so that they could make the residents about the deadly virus for their own and others’ safety,” he said, adding the awareness sessions for the shelter homes’ dwellers were a routine activity.\nThe Focal Person said thermo scanners, hand washing booths and disinfection walk through gates were installed at almost each ‘Panahgah of both the cities to promote healthy habits among the visitors, he added.\nHe said the residents were also being engaged in physical activities like grass cutting and tree plantation to enhance the green covers at the shelter homes.\n“All the initiatives being taken under the ‘Keep Panahgahs Clean’ specifically focus on protection of the residents’ lives through inclusiveness.”\nKeeping shelter homes open in the prevailing situation was a bold step which was a true reflection of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s vision of building a welfare state on the pattern of Medina, the focal person noted.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
