transforming it into a profit earning entity and first choice of air passengers.\nThe PIA management took measures for recovery of B-777, A 320, and ATR aircraft grounded for the last 13-22 months using own resources.\nThe airliner adopted a strategy to increase maximum take-off weight limitation on A-320 aircraft, enhancing payload carrying capacity, and held negotiations with Maintenance

meet market demand, and made efforts to achieve higher passenger revenues to reduce operational losses. It undertook Hajj flight operations using their own fleet rather than acquiring aircraft on lease for this purpose, besides starting new profitable routes including Sialkot-Paris, Sialkot-Barcelona, Peshawar- Sharjah, Peshawar-Al-Ain, and Multan-Sharjah.\nThe PIA discontinued loss-making routes, started operating additional flights on profitable routes like Dubai, Jeddah and Madina, terminated ghost employees and employees with fake degrees in accordance with the decision and direction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and put in place a centralized medical center for all PIA employees leading to cost savings.",
