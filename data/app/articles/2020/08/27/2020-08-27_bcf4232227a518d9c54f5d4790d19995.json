About local government system, the minister said, “Empowering local bodies would help resolve civic amenities related problems.”\nTo a question regarding fake medical reports of Ex Prime Minister, he said the court had granted bail to ailing Nawaz Sharif, on medical grounds.\nHe further stated that Nawaz Sharif, would have to submit medical reports to the court, otherwise, Shahbaz Sharif, who was the guaranter of his brother, could face trouble like Yousuf Raza Gillani.",
