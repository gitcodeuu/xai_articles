Around one million saplings would be planted in every nook and cranny on that day, he added.\nThe SAPM said previously, there was a record of planting 600,000 saplings in a day but this time the CRTF would set aside the previous record by planting one million trees across the country. “We have 1,000,000 volunteers of the ‘tiger force’, who will set a new record on August 9 by planting 1,000,000 trees in one day,” he remarked.\n“Our chief ministers, governors, parliamentarians, Prime Minister himself and MNAs (Members of National Assembly) will take part in the upcoming plantation drive and plant trees on the occasion.”\nAn application had been launched to make the CRTF more efficient and effective, he informed the Rawalpindi youth and said: “With the usage of digital technology, Prime Minister Imran Khan has empowered the ‘tiger force’ volunteers.”\nUsman Dar said now the CRTF members could directly report the violations of anti-COVID SOPs (Standard Operating Procedures) to the local administrations directly with this application. It would also help sensitize the volunteers about the SOPs.\nHe lamented the opposition for criticizing the ‘tiger force’ unnecessarily and urged the political opponents to visit in their respective areas to witness the untiring efforts of CRTF in curbing the virus spread.\nThe SAPM also spoke on the Kashmir issue and said the entire nation including men, women, senior citizens and children stood with their Kashmiri brothers and sister, who had been caged by the Modi led government for the last one year.\nHe said Prime Minister Imran Khan had fought the case of Kashmiris in the United Nations in unprecedented manner.",
