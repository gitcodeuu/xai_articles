More broadly, she said that Ehsaas is addressing women’s priorities through the economic response strategy, said a news release issued here.\nFurther, elaborating the women focused agenda of Ehsaas, Dr. Nishtar stated, foundation to Ehsaas is the realization that it is critically important to ensure that the program is responsive to needs of women in the country, who comprise 49% of total population.\nThe ambition of Ehsaas is to skew critical initiatives towards women, by ensuring that at least 50% of all beneficiaries targeted by the program across initiatives are women.\nTherefore, Ehsaas encompasses several social protection and poverty alleviation initiatives targeted towards women, across a plethora of initiatives including interest free loans (50% women), income program (60% women), undergraduate scholarships (50%), Kafaalat (7 million women).\nAlso, Insaf Card covers health conditions for women, preferentially.\nIn addition, labour force policies are being prepared by Ehsaas Labour Expert Group for women domestic workers, and rural women whose work is seen as an extension of their household responsibilities.\nLikewise, the second chance program for girls, and conditional cash transfers for primary education of children, 50% of them will also impact welfare of women, thus, opening the doors to rights and opportunities.\nIn short, the roundtable virtually combined significant ideas, responses and experiences around the gendered impacts of the pandemic. The panel collectively reiterated that the COVID-19 pandemic offers an opportunity to address the key challenges to achieving gender equality and build back better in post-COVID times.\nDrawing on the experience and useful lessons from Ehsaas Emergency Cash program, Dr. Nishtar said, “Pakistan is the fifth largest country in the world, there are 24 million breadwinners who rely on daily wages or are self-employed in the informal economy and life for them virtually came to a standstill with implementation of a lockdown in March.\nTo respond to this challenge, the government of Pakistan created the Ehsaas Emergency Cash program, which is the largest social protection program ever in the country’s history.\nIt was rolled-out within 10 days of the lockdown to deliver one-time emergency cash grants.\nShe said that 1.23 billion USD were allocated to support more than 16.9 million families which cover around 109 million people, this is approximately 50% of the country’s population.\nThe expert panel brought together Special Assistant to Prime Minister of Pakistan on Social Protection and Poverty Alleviation, the Minister of Social Affairs and Minister of Tourism of the Lebanese Republic, the Minister of Women Affairs and Social Development of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and Director General of the Pension Department of the Ministry of Planning, Finance and Industry of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.",
