He termed the stance in line with the views of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah on Palestine.\nOn the Kashmir dispute, he said Pakistan rejected India’s move of August 5 last year aimed at changing demography of Muslim majority Jammu and Kashmir Valley.\nHe said India was trying to impose the ideology of Hindutva against Muslims and other minorities in the country, a strategy also condemned by international human rights organizations, media and parliamentarians from around the world.\nHe said Imran Khan proved himself to be a true ambassador of Kashmir by highlighting the plight of Kashmiri people at all international forums.\nIndia was trying to impose the ideology of Hindutva against Muslims and other minorities\nDr Alvi urged the world to take notice of the military siege in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.
