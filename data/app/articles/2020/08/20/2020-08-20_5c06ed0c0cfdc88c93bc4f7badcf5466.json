In 1971, Rashid graduated from the academy as a general duty pilot and was posted to PAF base Masroor in Karachi’s Mauripur area to hone his skills as a fighter pilot, electronic channels reported.\nOn August 20, 1971, as a pilot still under training, Rashid was taxing out a T-33 Jet trainer for take-off, when a Bengali pilot instructor, Flight Lieutenant Matiur Rahman, forced his way into the rear cockpit. In mid-air Rahman knocked Minhas out, seized control of the aircraft and headed towards India.\nWith just 40 miles of Pakistan territory remaining, Rashid regained consciousness and tried to regain control of his aircraft. Failing to do so, he did the only thing within his control to prevent the aircraft from being taken to India he forced that plane to crash just 32 miles from the Indian border, deliberately sacrificing his life for the honour of Pakistan.\nRashid was laid to rest on August 21, 1971 with full military honours. The young trainee pilot’s entire family attended the funeral, along with senior PAF and other Armed Forces personnel.",
