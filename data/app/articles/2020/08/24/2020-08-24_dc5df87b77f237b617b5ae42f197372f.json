  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 24 (APP): Federal Minister for Railways Sheikh Rasheed Monday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government would not spare those elements who were involved in corruption cases and Prime Minister Imran Khan would complete his five years’ tenure.\nTalking to a private news channel, the minister said there was no difficulty for the government ahead, however, the corrupt elements would not be spared anywhere.\nSheikh said that many leaders of the PML-N and the PPP would be disqualified in the near future as they are facing serious corruption cases filed by the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and September 1 would be an important day for former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\nHe said all opposition parties are not on the same page, their ideology and agendas are different, adding weak opposition cannot harm Prime Minister Imran Khan’s government.\nThe federal minister said that case of PML-N president Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz was serious.\nMaulana Fazal was doing politics of ‘Tuck shops’ and he has become rolling stone these days and joined other small political parties instead of joining PML-N and PPP politics.\nPML-N leaders were raising hue and cry nowadays because they knew the fact that the government had found evidences of corruption against them, he added.\nSheikh Rashid also predicted that All Parties Conference (APC) of opposition will not be convened even after Muharram and said that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) have apparent differences but both political parties want NRO.\nSheikh Rasheed reinstated Prime Minister Imran Khan’s stance that the accused and corrupt politicians will not be granted an NRO at any cost.\nCommenting on Nawaz Sharif’s return to Pakistan, Rashid said that it will not be an easy task as they could not even bring Ishaq Dar and Suleman Shehbaz back to the country.\n“We are trying to manage bringing Nawaz Sharif back so he could face his trial,” Rashid added.",
