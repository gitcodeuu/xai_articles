  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 13 (APP): Minister for Railways Shaikh Rashid Ahmad on Thursday congratulated the nation on the 73th Independence Day of Pakistan, saying a separate homeland was a blessing and safe haven for its citizens keeping in view the ongoing atrocities on the Muslims across India.\nThe situation of Muslims in India was very pathetic, which had no precedent in the history, he said in a video message on the eve of Independence Day to be celebrated\nhttps://twitter.com/appcsocialmedia/status/1293906252817297408\nThe Indian Muslims were not allowed to perform their religious activities while their historical mosques were being demolished. It was very unfortunate that a Mandar (temple) was being constructed at the place of Babri Masjid, which was razed to ground by Hindu zealots (in 1992) in connivance with the extremist Indian government, he added.",
