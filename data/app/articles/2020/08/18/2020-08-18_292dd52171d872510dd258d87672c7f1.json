Out of the total approved loans, evaluation of 5,402 businesses is still underway,” he noted.\nHe said the Bank of Khyber (BoK), the Bank of Punjab (BoP) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), which deal with the Youth Entrepreneurship Scheme, sanctioned Rs four billion soft loans for 28,859 SMEs after scrutinizing total 58,031, selected for carrying out the businesses’ analysis.\nOut of 28,859 SMEs, the official said, 14,664 had been rejected by the banks, whereas 6,489 were under processes.\nHe said after evaluating the pre-feasibilities of all the applicants of YES, the banks had initially selected total 58,031 businesses for scrutiny. Scrutiny of some 10,699 was still underway, while 18,473 had been rejected.\nMore than one million applications were received under the Kamyab Jawan Programme, but unfortunately most of the applicants did not come up with practical business ideas, he said in response to a query.\nHe said the government last week expanded the soft-loan scheme to benefit maximum number of young people across the country. The loan amount had been raised upto Rs 25 million.\nThree tiers were introduced under the programme for disbursement of loans ranging from Rs 100,000 to Rs 25 million among the youth, having workable business ideas. Third tier for a loan ranging from Rs 10 million to Rs 25 million has been added after the expansion of programme.\nHe said the mark-up rates on initial two tiers had also been halved from 6 per cent and 8 per cent to 3 per cent and four per cent respectively.\nThe government, in its two year tenure, has taken multiple pro-youth initiatives to turn the youngsters in the go-getters of the society through their skill development, said a document issued by the government to highlight its two-year performance.\nIt mentioned the successful implementation of the Hunarmand Pakistan (Skill for All) programme, aimed at promoting basic and technical skills among youth.\nIt said Rs 10 billion had been allocated for the first phase of the country’s largest skill development programme. Along with traditional trades, training in high-tech technologies (artificial intelligence, robotics, automation etc.) was offered for the first time in the country.\nIt was meant to develop skills of more than 170,000 Pakistani youth through establishment of a number of institutions across the country.\nOther initiatives included the National Youth Development Framework (NYDF) – a first national policy vision which envisages empowerment of youth through three –Es i.e. Education, Engagement and Employment, the National Youth Council,the Corona Relief Tiger Force and many others.",
