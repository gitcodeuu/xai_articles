  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 18 (APP): The Federal Cabinet on Tuesday paid tribute to Prime Minister Imran Khan for steering the troubled country out of multiple crises with his visionary approach.\nBriefing the media after the cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan, Minister for Information and Broadcasting Shibli Faraz said Pakistan under the PM’s leadership set an exemplary precedent by tackling the corona pandemic.\nThe major step was setting up the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC), which handled the situation scientifically.\nThe cabinet members unanimously said whatever the PM did during the crisis situation, especially after the coronavirus outbreak, had no precedent, he added.\nShibli said in August 2018 when the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government came to power, the country’s economy was on the verge of collapse and its revival was not an easy task.\nHe said during the past one week many positive developments took place. With record increase in remittances and emergence of Pakistan Stock Exchange as the second fastest growing market of the world, Moody’s had declared Pakistan’s economy as stable, which were the proof of improvement of economy.\nHe said with the grace of Allah Almighty, Pakistan despite limited resources and weak health infrastructure, succeeded to handle the coronavirus situation far better than many developed countries.\nThe country had shortage of personnel protective equipment at the start of pandemic but now it was exporting the same, he added.\nThe minister said the cabinet also appreciated the PM for raising the Kashmir issue courageously in the United Nations by becoming the advocate of Kashmiris.\nShibli quoted the PM as saying when intentions were good and one had feelings for the poor Allah Almighty also helped. Pakistan emerged victorious from the coronavirus, economic crisis and post-Pulwama situation due to the blessings of Allah Almighty.\nAs regards the agenda items, he said the cabinet gave approval to the proposal of restructuring of power distribution companies and names of their new board members would be made public soon.\nThe cabinet also discussed the formation of pensioners fund. The PM remarked that after the circular debt, pension was the second largest issue being faced by the government.\nShibli said the past rulers took only those decisions which benefitted and suited them politically and ignored the ones which were otherwise.\nOn the contrary, he said, the PTI government was taking decisions in the national interest irrespective of their political fallout. The pension payments had become a major issue as retired federal employees were paid Rs 470 billion as pension per annum.\nThe prime minister directed that the experts should be involved in the management of pension fund.\nThe cabinet, he said, also gave approval to the export of locally made personal protection equipment.\nIt also approved the proposal for the construction of high rise residential apartments in Quetta on the land of Housing Ministry.\nThe cabinet accorded approval to the implementation of Pakistan Essential Services Act 1953 on the employees of Pakistan Television Corporation.\nShibli Faraz said the meeting of the Committee on Prices of Essential Commodities was also held, which reviewed the prices of flour and sugar.\nHe said the Sindh government was not releasing the wheat quota allocated for flour mills of the province, which was also affecting other provinces.\nHe said the meeting was briefed about the talks of Federal Minister for Industries Hammad Azhar and Punjab Food Minister Aleem Khan with sugar mill owners and distributors.\nThe government had allowed import of both wheat and flour which would help discourage the hoarders and profiteers, he added.\nReplying to the questions of media persons, the minister said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leaders and workers knew that only sycophants were given any importance in their party.\nThe PML-N spokesperson had forgotten how her party leadership had made the country bankrupt and built their own properties abroad by plundering the national resources, he added.\nShibli Faraz said the Sindh government of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) had adopted a step-motherly attitude towards Karachi while the Federal Government was taking all possible steps to resolve the problems of the metropolis.\nThe people of Karachi had given the mandate to PTI and resolution of their problems was the top priority of its government, he added.\nThe minister said the Sindh government was getting its due share in the national resources and it was its prime responsibility to resolve the problems of Karachiites.\nTo a query he said the government was bringing a new plan for the betterment of Pakistan Television, under which the problems of PTV pensioners would also be solved.",
