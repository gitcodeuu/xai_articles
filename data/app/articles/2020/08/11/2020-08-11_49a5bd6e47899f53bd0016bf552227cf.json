The foreign secretary highlighted India’s illegal and unilateral action of August 5,2019 and its aftermath, focusing in particular on massive human rights violations in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), attempts to change the demographic structure of the occupied territory, and intensified ceasefire violations along the Line of Control.\nHe underlined that India’s continuing military siege in IIOJK and its aggressive posturing against Pakistan posed a threat to peace and security.
