Kashmiris were assured of their right to self-determination by the highest body in the world that is United National Security Council (UNSC), he added.\nHe underlined that the Hindutva ideology was a serious threat to the regional peace and security and minorities in India were no longer safe.\nThe high commissioner reiterated that the government of Pakistan and its people were fully committed to the Kashmir cause and the world was gradually recognizing the extremist nature of the Modi government and the continued oppression against Kashmiris in IIOJK.\n“Kashmiris are resilient nation who have been under an uninterrupted military siege for the last one-year and Pakistan calls upon UN to implement its resolutions with regards to Jammu and Kashmir’ he concluded.\nProminent Canada based human rights advocates including Dr. Zafar Bangash, Karen Rodman, Fareed Khan, Dr. Fozia Alvi, Dr. Shabana Haider and Farhan Mujahid Chak also participated in the webinar.\nThey highlighted several aspects of the human rights situation in IIOJK.",
