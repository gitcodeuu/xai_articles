  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 06 (APP):Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi Thursday said the unanimous resolution passed by Parliament on actions of India on Kashmir on August 5, 2019, reflected the aspirations of Kashmiris struggling for their freedom from India.\nSpeaking in the joint session of the Parliament, he said Kashmir issue was 72 years old and it existed even in the governments of Pakistan Muslim League (N) and Pakistan Peoples Party.\n“As the nation will remain determined, the Line of Control across Jammu and Kashmir will be erased and Kashmiris will become one and will get their freedom.”\nHe said Kashmir issued was discussed in the United Nations Security Council on three occasions with the support of China.\nDespite the efforts of India to stop the debate, the issue was raised in the UNSC and the matter was internationalized, he noted.\nHe said Prime Minister Imran Khan took up the issue of Kashmir with clarity during his speech at the United Nations General Assembly.\nHe said the issue was also taken up by European Union and India was put in the dock for human rights violations in Indian Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nThe international media gave widespread coverage to the Kashmir issue, he said adding 85 members of the United States Congress expressed concern on the situation in Kashmir.\nAll the parties in House of Commons in Britain brought Kashmir issue under discussion, he told. He stressed that he was ready to brief the members of opposition on the Kashmir issue at any place of their convenience.\nHe said Kashmir issue was put on the back-burner during the tenure of previous governments.\nHe thanked the opposition benches for supporting the resolution on Kashmir and the bill for mutual legal assistance in criminal matters.\nHe said Pakistan was successfully able to defeat the narrative of India on Kashmir issue, adding India had to rescind its constitutional measures to strip Kashmir of its special status, otherwise Pakistan would not talk to India.\nIndia was running away from multilateralism, he said adding Modi could not come to Pakistan without visa and he would not be presented with gifts in Pakistan as was done by the previous government.\nQureshi said there were no two opinions among people in Pakistan on the issue of Kashmir and the whole nation was united, adding Parliament and the Senate passed unanimous resolutions in support of Kashmiris struggling for their right to self determination and for freedom from India.\nAll the Kashmiris were not looking towards New Delhi now but were looking towards Pakistan, he added.\nHe said Pakistan had condemned the use of brutal force by India against the Kashmiris.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, he said he talked to more than 40 foreign ministers and discussed with them ceasefire violations of Line of Control (LoC).\nThe government had a plan to build bunkers along LoC to protect lives of Kashmiris, he disclosed.\nThe minister said Pakistan was in the grey list in 2018 when the government of Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) was formed.\nHe pointed out that the international community had appreciated the legislation done by Pakistan to meet the obligations towards Financial Action Task Force.\nThe minister said the opposition supported the legislation not for the sake of government but for the sake of the country.\nSome other parties which did not support the legislation should have backed it in the interest of Pakistan, he added.\nHe said the bill on mutual legal assistance was passed after holding consultations with the opposition parties in the Parliament.\nHe said the world had acknowledged Prime Minister Imran Khan’s foreign policy on Afghanistan.",
