  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 06 (APP):Minister for Communications Murad Saeed on Thursday said the incumbent government has internationalized Kashmir dispute.\nSpeaking in the joint session of the Parliament, he said, Prime Minister Imran Khan became the voice of Kashmiri people and effectively presented the case of Kashmiris at all international forums including United Nations General Assembly.\n“Prime Minister Imran Khan presented the Kashmir case in an effective manner at the United Nations General Assembly and exposed the real face of India before the comity of nations,” he said adding the government of Pakistan firmly stood with the Kashmiri people in their struggle to get freedom from the Indian occupation forces, he said.\nThe minister said, though India claimed that Kashmir was its internal matter but due to the efforts of Pakistan it had now become an international issue.\nMurad Saeed said, due to the present government’s effective policy, the Kashmir issue was discussed in the United Nations Security Council four times.\nTerming Narendra Modi ‘Hitler’ of the new era, he said being a member of the terrorist organization RSS (Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh), the Indian prime minister was pursuing the Hindutva mindset.\nCriticizing the opposition, he said, only opposition parties and India had objection on the renaming a road as Srinagar Highway.\nHe said that whole nation including people of Azad Jammu Kashmir were protesting against Indian August 5 action but Bilawal Bhutto and Shehbaz Sharif were missing from the protest.\nHe alleged that Nawaz Sharif refused to meet leaders of Kashmir during his visit to India.\nMurad Saeed alleged that during Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi visit to Pakistan, Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government had removed the Kashmir House\nsignboard.\nHe said, “Today all the Kashmiri leaders are appreciating the stance of Prime Minister Imran Khan on the Kashmir issue.”\nAbout Financial Action Task Force (FATF) he said, all the opposition leaders, who wanted changes in the accountability law, had their cases in the National Accountability Bureau (NAB). The opposition said that it would allow legislation in the interest of Pakistan if corruption cases of less than Rs 1 billion were not taken up by NAB.\n“The reality is that Pakistan is now in the grey list because of the loot and plunder of opposition parties,” he remarked. He said the government was undertaking legislation to take Pakistan from the grey list to white list.\nHe claimed that opposition wanted to withdraw their cases of money laundering and TT in return for the support of FATF bill. He said that the opposition also expressed desire to start accountability after 1999.\nEarlier chairman of PPP Bilawal Bhutto said, PPP founder late Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had stated that Pakistan would fight for thousand years for Kashmir.\nHe said that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi Illegally and unconstitutionally besieged Jammu and Kashmir which was also violation of Shimla Pact.\nHe said that final decision about Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K) would be made by the citizens of Kashmir through the right of plebiscite.\nBilawal Bhutto said the military siege of IIOJ&K would not diminish the aspirations of the people of the bleeding valley.\nBilawal reiterated the commitment of the PPP founder Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and said, “I will never compromise on the Kashmir issue”. The PPP continued to stand by the Kashmiri brethren, he added.\nThe PPP leader said the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-driven Hindutva ideology of apartheid being pursued by the butcher of Muslims, Narendra Modi, would not succeed and the issue of Kashmir would only be resolved through a plebiscite.\nHe said the silence maintained by the international community over the Indian atrocities in IIOJ&K had raised the concerns of human rights activists worldwide and urged that the world should wake up from slumber and force India to lift the military siege by allowing free exercise of Kashmiris their right to self-determination.\nThe chairman said that his party will cooperate with government on legislation related to National Security, National Action Plan, terrorism, extremism and FATF.\n“On the FATF and the National Action Plan, the PPP had always extended\nsupport and it wanted to back the government on these issues in future also,” he added.",
