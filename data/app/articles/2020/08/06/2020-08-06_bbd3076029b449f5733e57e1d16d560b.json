It appreciated the visits to Pakistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) by the UK’s All-Party Parliamentary Kashmir Group (APPKG) and the OIC Secretary General’s Special Envoy on Kashmir.\nThe Parliament stressed that the BJP leaders’ threatening statements and belligerent rhetoric as well as irresponsible and aggressive Indian actions pose a grave threat to peace, security and stability in South Asia.\nIt said it sensitized the world community again about the possibility of a ‘false flag’ terrorist operation by India and any ill-considered misadventure. It reaffirmed the firm resolve of the people and the armed forces of Pakistan to thwart any act of aggression resolutely and effectively.\nThe Parliament underscored that the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-BJP dispensation in India was driven by the toxic mix of extremist ideology (Hindutva) and hegemonic designs (Akhand Bharat), which posed a threat inter alia to the Kashmiri people under Indian occupation, to the minorities in India, and to regional peace and stability.\nIt also underscored that Jammu and Kashmir was an internationally recognized dispute and the longest outstanding item on the agenda of the UNSC and categorically stated that the “illegal Indian steps do not and cannot alter its disputed status”.\nThe Parliament reaffirmed the inalienable right to self-determination of the people of Jammu and Kashmir as enshrined in the relevant UNSC resolutions and protected by international law. It also reaffirmed previous resolutions of the National Assembly and the Senate, expressing unflinching, unwavering and unstinting solidarity and commitment of the people of Pakistan with the people of IIOJK.\nIt demanded from India to rescind its illegal unilateral actions of August 5, 2019, immediately lift its inhuman military siege in IIOJK, stop its illegal measures to change the demographic structure of the occupied territory and stop extra judicial killings of Kashmiri youth in fake encounters and cordon-and-search operations; release the illegally detained Kashmiri youth and political leadership; remove restrictions on media, Internet and mobile communications, movement and peaceful assembly; provide access in IIOJK to human rights and humanitarian organizations, independent observers and the media; repeal its draconian laws including Armed Forces Special Power Act (AFSPA), Public Safety Act (PSA) and Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA), withdraw over 900,000 occupation troops from IIOJK; and give Kashmiris their inalienable right to self-determination.\nThe Parliament called upon the international community to use all tools at its disposal to hold India accountable for its illegal and unilateral actions and human rights violations against the Kashmiri people, pressurize India to adhere to its international human rights obligations, and allow international media, humanitarian organizations and independent observers entry into IIOJK to independently verify reports of abuse, violations and use of excessive force.\nIt urged the UN Human Rights Council to constitute a commission of inquiry to investigate gross and consistent human rights violations in IIOJ&K being committed by the Indian occupation forces with impunity under the cover of the two draconian laws – AFSPA and PSA– as recommended by the two reports of the UN High Commissioner for human rights.\nThey reiterated that Pakistan will continue providing all possible support to the Kashmiri people- until they achieve their legitimate right to self-determination through a free and impartial plebiscite under the auspices of the United Nations, as recognized by the relevant UNSC resolutions.",
