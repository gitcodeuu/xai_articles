The federal cabinet chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan categorically stated that “the government would not be blackmailed over the tactics to get an NRO in shape of relief to the corrupt”.\nThe Prime Minister mentioned that two such NROs (National Reconciliation Ordinances) given by the previous governments incurred heavy financial losses to the country, pushing it to the verge of collapse under debts.\nThe cabinet noted that Nawaz Sharif misused the facility extended to him by the government.
