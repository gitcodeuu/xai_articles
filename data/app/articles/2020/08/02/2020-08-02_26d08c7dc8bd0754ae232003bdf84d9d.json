Speaking in a private TV channel programme, the minister said regulating social media was a difficult task but it was essential. Replying to a question, he said the prime minister also had personal interest in regulating the social media.\nThe minister said projecting the government and policies of the prime minister was the responsibility of the ministry of information which was a challenging task and social media was also part of it. To another query, he said he was not in favour of ban on media and fully support freedom of expression but it should be under the parameters of decency.\nShibli Faraz said national institutions had been destroyed by the previous governments through political recruitments, where incompetent were placed on important seats and expressed hope that things would improve in coming six (6) months.
