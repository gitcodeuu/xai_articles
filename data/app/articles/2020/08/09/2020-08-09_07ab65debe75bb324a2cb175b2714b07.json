He said that such moves showed Pakistan’s commitment to the cause of liberating the occupied territory from the Indian subjugation.\nIndian police have shifted the illegally detained General Secretary of Tehreek-e-Hurriyat Jammu and Kashmir, Ameer Hamza Shah, from Sopore Police Station to Kot Bhalwal Jail after booking him under draconian law, Public Safety Act.\nSrinagar-based human rights activist Khurram Parvez, in an article in the US-based Time magazine, wrote that Indian government made full use of coronavirus lockdowns by passing the domicile rule.\nHe pointed out that in just more than a month, around 400,000 people have already acquired domicile certificates and added it could alter the results of any referendum seeking people’s opinion for the resolution of the larger, international dispute over control of the territory.\nRenowned Kashmiri journalist, Yousuf Jameel, in an article wrote that while people from all walks of life have been facing severe difficulties after the repeal of Kashmir’s special status by Narendra Modi government on August 5, last year, the journalists are also facing hurdles in performing their professional duties.\nHe maintained that several journalists, who opposed the Indian government’s measures, were charged with sedition and some are still imprisoned.\nOn the other hand, eminent citizens of India and Pakistan have said that India’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party was bent to overturn the Muslim majority character of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir. They stated this in a report, titled ‘The Siege: A Year Since Abrogation’ drafted by the members of Jammu and Kashmir Solidarity Group and Pakistan-India People’s Forum for Peace and Democracy.\nThe comprehensive report based on eyewitness accounts and findings of fact-finding teams, which visited the region, said that New Delhi was committing grave injustices, ranging from kidnapping and torture of minors to decimating the identity of people.",
