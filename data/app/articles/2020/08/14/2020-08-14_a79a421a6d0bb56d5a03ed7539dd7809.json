The oppressive measures would further enhance hatred and resentment against India, he added.\n“I assure the resilient people of IIOJK that Pakistan would continue to support them in their just struggle for their right to self-determination as enshrined in the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) resolutions,” he said.",
