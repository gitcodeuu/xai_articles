It was high time for the world powers to take strict notice of the worst human rights violations committed by the Indian troops in the IIOJK, he added.\nFakhar Imam said the Pakistani nation would observe the Youm-e-Istehsal on Wednesday as a day of solidarity with their proud and valiant Kashmiri brethren.\n“Pakistan is steadfast in its support to the Kashmiris and it will continue exposing the Indian atrocities in occupied Kashmir at every front,” he said.\nPakistan, he said, was committed to stand with the Kashmiris in their struggle for the right to self-determination. It had a clear stance that Kashmir was its jugular vein and it would never compromise on the Kashmir cause.\nThe minister paid tributes to the Kashmiri martyrs and their families over their sacrifices for the freedom of Kashmir.\nHe said all the political parties, institutions and people of Pakistan were united for the Kashmir cause. A strong and united Pakistan was the key to the resolution of the Kashmir dispute, he added.",
