The Pakistan nation was religiously bound with their Muslim brethren of India and Kashmir, and they would would not let them alone in the hour of trial.\nThe minister said Pakistan strongly condemned the Indian action to build a temple at the place of Babri Masjid in in Ayodhya. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had shown his intention of constructing a Ram Mandir during his visit to Ayodhya about 30 years ago and he had now chosen the date to lay its foundation coinciding with the first anniversary of his illegal action about the IIOJK on August 5, 2019.\nEvery Hindu politician had done politics on the Babri Mosque issue, he added.",
