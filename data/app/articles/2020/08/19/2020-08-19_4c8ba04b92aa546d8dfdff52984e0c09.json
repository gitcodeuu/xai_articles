  "content": "MIRPUR (AJK): Aug 19 (APP): President, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK), Sardar Masood Khan on Wednesday said before clash with China\nat Ladakh, India had planned to launch a false flag operation or some sort of limited military adventure against Pakistan to christen its criminal genocide in Kashmir as fight against terrorism.\n“The beating from China may well have deterred Indian commanders from opening another front or it is probable that they are biding their time and will strike again in one form or the other. Highest vigilance and preparedness is the utmost priority,” he cautioned in an article published in a national periodical, AJK President office said.\nThe AJK President said Ladakh standoff demonstrated not just discomfiture, but a glaring defeat for India. He added that after August 5 2019, India’s bravado had no limits as it went on to threaten to “take back” Azad Kashmir and Aksai Chin militarily.\nPakistan did not take Indian threats lightly, nor did China. But China’s entry into the Kashmir conflict has two dimensions. First, Kashmiris and Pakistan experienced schadenfreude to see India repulsed at the Galwan Valley because of the Modi government’s high-handed, criminal conduct in IIOJ&K and its persecution of Indian Muslims. Second, it makes the situation even more complex and apparently intractable when people ask about China as the “third party” to the Kashmir dispute, he maintained.\nHighlighting the international community’s reaction over horrendous developments in IIOJ&K, President Masood said last year, immediately after India’s abrogation of Articles 370 and 35 A and military takeover of the territory, the international community – the media, think tanks, parliamentarians, civil society – all came out strongly to castigate and condemn India and express solidarity with the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJ&K).\nHe said United Nations Security Council held in-camera sessions, the U.S. congressional committees held hearings, British lawmakers wrote to the UN Secretary-General to take action, the European Parliament held a plenary session on Kashmir, European parliamentarians tabled half a dozen resolutions calling out India’s excesses, and the diaspora community really turned the Kashmir issue into an international movement.\nThough the intensity of attention to Kashmir lasted for three months last year – August through October – it opened new doors and broke many taboos like India could not be held accountable loudly.\nYet, the attention of those very forces that shone a light on the harrowing situation in Kashmir was distracted by other developments unrelated to Kashmir. The China-India standoff rekindled interest in Kashmir.\nAJK President said Kashmir proved to be a great unifier for Pakistan and Azad Kashmir. The entire nation rose with the passion and conviction to salvage their Kashmiri brothers and sisters from forced annexation\nto India and from the murderous campaign of Indian soldiers against them.\nIn the international realm, Pakistan did well to raise consciousness about the disenfranchisement and enslavement of Kashmiris and the pressure that this had generated in the region.\nThe security situation in South Asia, the world was told, had become extremely perilous because of the Indian threats to attack Azad Kashmir and disintegrate Pakistan with the strong indications of using nuclear weapons.\nPakistan, he maintained, also made the world aware of the re-incarnation of fascism in the form of Hindutva and its dire repercussions for regional and global peace, stability and security.",
