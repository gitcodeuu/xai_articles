  "content": "BEIJING, Aug 19 (APP): Dive! Dive! Put up your hands and dive … voices of students come from the Longgang primary school, Suqian, Jiangsu, an eastern-central coastal province of China as they read aloud following their “new” English teacher, Ali, a Pakistani, in the summer school of 2020.\nThe 25-day-summer school is a public benefit activity organized by Suqian Yangfan Social Work Organization. Ali is a volunteer of the activity and that’s why he is “new” for these students, according to a report published by China Economic Net (CEN) on Wednesday.\nAli volunteers to take charge of English training as he is a professional English teacher with several years’ experience in China. “Why to teach children? Because I love children. It is fun to teach them,” said Ali. He is good at teaching kids.\nAli said, “Kids are kids. They love to play activities. We have to be friendly with them.”\nOne student of the summer school said, “Mr Ali can turn some words into a song. It is easier for us to learn. He is also friendly to us.”\nAs a Pakistani, Ali’s bond to China started in Australia. Ali migrated to Australia with his parents when he was a little boy. Ali met his Chinese wife there in his student days. After receiving his MBA degree, Ali and his wife came to China.\nIn the beginning, Ali once had worked as a teacher in Shanghai and Nanjing. Two years later, he came to Suqian.\nAli said the relaxed life pace here brought inner peace to him. Moreover, people were friendly to him.\nAli said he felt totally at home here as a Pakistani because of the profound friendship of China and Pakistan.\nTo give something back to the community, Ali has taken part in the voluntary public service and he also enjoyed it.",
