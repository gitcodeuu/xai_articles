However, it was not immediately clear if he has been charged under any offence.\nPertinently, Shibli was detained under the draconian Public Safety Act for nine months in Bareilly Jail of Uttar Pradesh, India, after he had tweeted information about the deployment of additional troops in occupied Jammu and Kashmir in the last week of July 2019. On August 5, 2019, the Government of India revoked the occupied territory’s special status and clamped down on the region. He was released after nine months of imprisonment.",
