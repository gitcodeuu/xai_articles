  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 31 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Senator Shibli Faraz on Monday said opposition, while putting aside the national interest, wanted to get “NRO” (National Reconciliation Ordinance) in exchange for its support of legislation related to the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\nAddressing a press conference here, he said while opposing FATF legislation, the opposition did everything to push Pakistan into the black list of FATF.\nPakistan could not afford to get in the black list of FATF, he said adding, “We have to pass these FATF bills to protect Pakistan from financial difficulties and people from the impact of inflation.”\nOpposition wanted NRO by changing the law and by interpreting the law in its own favour, he said.\nShibli said it was still hoped that opposition would support the FATF legislation. “I urge members of Parliament to keep in view the interest of the country.”\nThe opposition parties were raising hue and cry as they wanted that nobody should ask them about their theft, he stressed.\nThe minister said Prime Minister Imran Khan was constantly in touch with the authorities on the situation in Karachi and would visit the city in the current week.\nOur sympathies were with the people of Karachi, he added.\nHe said the prime minister talked to chief minister Sindh and assured of his cooperation.\nHe said a three point programme given by the Prime Minister would be implemented in coordination with the Sindh government to resolve issues in Karachi.\nHe said the federal government never did politics on the issues of Karachi but unfortunately Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) was doing so on the present situation.\nPPP leadership was holding press conferences and today its leader Qamar Zaman Kaira held a press conference on the situation in Karachi, he continued.\nWhenever there was an issue of national importance, the top leadership of PPP disappeared from the country, he remarked.\nShibli said Imran Khan would not go along with those people in the country who were rejected in the elections on August 18, 2018 and looted the country.\nImran Khan was consistently working for the welfare of people especially for\npoor and middle class, he added.\nAll his initiatives were for poor in the Naya Pakistan, he observed.\nShibli said the government in Sindh took trillions of rupees but the province miserably lacked infrastructure, roads, health and education facilities and the law and order situation was also bad.\nHe said if the federal government would give more money to the Sindh government it would go into their personal bank accounts.\nOpposition had only one agenda and it was trying that the government should not succeed in resolving problems of the people, he added.\n“We exposed the reality of the opposition before the people.”\nShibli said opposition’s All Parties Conference would not be held as the opposition leaders were not sincere with each other.\nImran Khan was taking Pakistan out of difficulties with determination, however the opposition was not interested in the welfare of people, he asserted.\nThe minister said no doubt there were problems of inflation but eventually the government would overcome the challenges.\nIndicators of the economy were positive and economic activity was being revived and the good days would come.\nHe assured that prices of sugar and wheat would come down with the import of these commodities.\nHe said the government had almost overcome the issue of coronavirus but still care was needed to stop spread of the disease.",
