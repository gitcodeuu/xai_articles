By fighting the Indian army without weapons, they are setting a new tradition in the history of freedom struggle.”\nHe said he and his colleagues of the Kashmir Committee had come to Muzaffarabad on the occasion of Eid to express solidarity with the Kashmiris. It was an expression of the strong support of the Government of Pakistan and the Pakistani Parliament for Kashmir.\nHe said India was killing Kashmiris under its plan of genocide – that was a blatant violation of the freedom of expression of the United Nations.\nShehryar Afridi said India’s relentless failures at the international level and Prime Minister Imran Khan’s persistent raising of the Kashmir issue at the world fora were a reflection of the fact that the goal of Kashmir’s independence was near.\nAfridi also called on the AJK president and prime minister.\nAccompanied by Prime Minister Farooq Haider, he met the APHC delegation.\nTalking on the occasion, Afridi said instead of telling stories of the past, “we have to formulate a strategy for the future so that the Kashmiris can get freedom.\n“We have made a decision that enough is enough. Now we have to act now and turn claims into practice.”\nHe said the enemy was clever and was confusing the Pakistani youth through rumours and suspicions through hybrid war. The ban on Eid prayers in the Indian Illegal Occupied Jammu and Kashmir was a violation of the UN Charter and the International Convention on Religious Freedom.\nAfridi said he would hold the fascist government of India accountable for the criminal act of sealing the Jamia Masjid Srinagar on the occasion of Eid and encircling people with barbed wire.\nAJK Prime Minister Raja Farooq Haider said India was stockpiling weapons in Ladakh after facing a humiliating defeat at the hands of China.\nHe said India had engineered 19 massacres in its bid to change the demographics of Kashmir.\nAPHC leader Faiz Naqshbandi said the Indian forces imposed curfew and siege, besides stopping delivery of fruits to market.\nHe said it was time to accelerate the Kashmir independence movement.\nSenator Barrister Muhammad Ali Saif said the Kashmir Committee was fighting the case of Kashmiris at every forum and it would continue to raise its voice for them. He said the daughters and mothers of IIOJK were even today awaiting for the return of their missing sons and husbands",
