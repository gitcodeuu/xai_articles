They added that markets and business establishments across the valley were shut on Monday, while public transport was off the roads.\nThe Indian troops, paramilitary forces and police personnel have been deployed in strength at several places in the valley to enforce the siege with officials warning that any violation would invite strict action. New Delhi on August 5 last year revoked the special status of Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir by abrogating Articles 370 and 35-A of its constitution.",
