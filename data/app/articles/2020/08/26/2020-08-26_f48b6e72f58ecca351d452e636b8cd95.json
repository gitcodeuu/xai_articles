Now the first-ever civil-military interface in the field of science in Pakistan will help boost the research culture”.\nAbout the country’s efforts regarding COVID-19, the minister said when the first case of COVID-19 appeared; Pakistan was relying on import of medical equipment even goggles, masks and protective face shields but now became a major exporter of COVID-19 medical products.\nEmphasizing the need to formulate the next 10 years policy keeping in view the requirements of modern technologies, the minister said if any country wants to achieve progress; it has to focus on science and technology.\nHe said it is very unfortunate that the science and technology ministry was not given due attention in the past years.\nHe recalled Pakistan had started its space program even before China and India but now people express astonishment when we talk about sending our space mission by next year.\nChaudhry Fawad said Chinese ambassador is the most popular ambassador among all in Pakistan.
