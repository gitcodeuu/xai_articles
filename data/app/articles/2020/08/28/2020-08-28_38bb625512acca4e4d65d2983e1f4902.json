Qatar and Turkey greatly supported and facilitated the Syrian refugees too.\nSensitizing the Ambassador over plight of Kashmiri Muslims, Shehryar Afridi said that Hindutva regime in India is targeting religious minorities for mass conversions and Muslims are being targeted specially.\nKashmir has become a specific area where Muslims are being martyred, imprisoned and women are raped under a vicious plan of Muslim genocide.\nAmbassador Sheikh Saud bin Abdul Rahman Al Thani said that Qatar has been working with Pakistan on plans and initiatives to help the needy and deserving.\n“As a flying officer, I was trained by professional Pakistani forces and it is the time to return the favour. We have doubled the number of Pakistani labor and another 90,000 Pakistanis have been added to the Qatar workforce in the past one year. We are facilitating the visa process and we have simplified the visa process,” the Ambassador said.\nThe Ambassador said that the cooperation with Pakistan was a priority area for his government and he would work extensively to promote brotherhood between the two nations.",
