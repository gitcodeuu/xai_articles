During a presser, i was asked if the prices of POL were about to go up north.\nI clearly said the prices of petroleum products are mainly determined keeping in the prices in the international market and the dollar-rupee exchange rate.”\nThe minister clarified that he did mention a published report the same day predicting a price cut, without saying if that possibility was around the corner or not.\nMurtaza Solangi said it remained the domain of OGRA and it was the only body to make any announcement about the petroleum products prices.\nThe minister said he did not hint at what was reported in a national English daily.He said it would help both the newspaper and Khaleeq Kiani to listen to the question asked to him and his complete answer before making any conclusion about it.\nThe minister also shared a paragraph from the news report : ” Interestingly, the hints at price reductions were made by caretaker commerce Minister Gohar Ijaz and Caretaker Information Minster Murtaza Solangi, both of whom have no role in determining the prices”.",
