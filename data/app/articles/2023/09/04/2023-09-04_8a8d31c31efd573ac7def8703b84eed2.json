  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 04 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Monday instructed the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to arrest the personnel of Capital Police named in a case pertaining to illegally detaining the citizens in police stations for ransom.\nJustice Babar Sattar, who heard the case, was informed by an FIA official that the police personnel were not cooperating for the investigation.\nThe court asked that whether the arrest warrants of the accused personnel had been issued. The accused must be arrested if they were not joining the investigation process as law was equal for everyone, it added.\nAdvocate Tahir Kazim, counsel for the Inspector General of Police Islamabad, informed the court that the IGP had suspended four police personnel, including an assistant sub-inspector, who were involved in the raid, and proceedings against them were underway at three forums.\nThe court, however, noted that the senior officials involved in the matter were not suspended. The contempt of court proceedings, lodging of an first information report and departmental action could be initiated at the same time, it added.\nThe court questioned whether the comments had been submitted against the show-cause notice, observing it would hear this matter on next hearing if the answer was not found satisfactory.\nThe case was then adjourned.",
