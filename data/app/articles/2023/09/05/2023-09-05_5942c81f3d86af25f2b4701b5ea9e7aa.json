Stakeholders emphasized the urgent necessity of designating marine and coastal areas as Protected Areas.\n“Presently, less than 1% of the coast enjoys protection, and Pakistan, as a dedicated CBD signatory, needs to declare at least 30% of its coast as Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) under the 30×30 agenda,” said Country Representative of IUCN, Mahmood Akhtar Cheema.\nIn pursuit of this urgent need for MPA declaration, the NCB platform, through its IUCN-MFF-programme, established a dedicated sub-committee. This sub-committee identified coastal and marine areas suitable for MPA designation which include Ras Malan, off Pasni, Kalamat Hor, Charna Island, Miani Hor, and Jewani, explained the Inspector General of Forests, Ghulam Qadir Shah.\nIn his remarks Inspector General of Forest (IGF)/ Secretary NCB, Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, Ghulam Qadir Shah praised NCB as a prime example of collective achievements in the domain of coastal preservation.\nHe further said that NCB was the only forum that has not only persevered but thrived, remaining active even after the culmination of the IUCN-MFF programme across the region.\nFurther enhancing this commitment, the 22nd meeting has taken a significant step forward by officially reviving the subcommittee responsible for MPA designation.\nThe NCB meeting also launched Building Resilience of Coastal Ecological and Social Systems of Pakistan project  generously funded by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation.\n“This project will primarily focus on the establishment and strengthening of MPAs, with the main emphasis on the development of a management plan for pre-exisitng Astola Island MPA.\nFurthermore, the project aims to rehabilitate degraded coastal ecosystem, enhance capacity building and diversify livelihoods of local communities, thus contributing to the holistic well-being of both people and the environment,” said Naveed Soomro, Manager Sindh Programme at IUCN.\nRiaz Wagan, Conservator Forest, Sindh Forest Department, shared the achievement of Sindh Forest department in increasing mangrove cover to about 160,000 hectares.\nHe also emphasized the significance of the carbon offsetting potential of mangroves in the blue carbon market.\nCaptain Badshah of the Pakistan Navy highlighted the Pakistan Navy’s contributions to marine protection, particularly through their water treatment, desalination, and mangrove restoration projects.\nDuring the event, Ghullam Muhammad, Chief Conservator of Forests at Balochistan Forest and Wildlife Department, shared their coastal conservation initatives under the Green Pakistan Program, an extension of the Ten Billion Tree Tsunami Program. He also highlighted successful mangrove restoration initiatives in collaboration with IUCN within the Balochistan Integrated Water Resources Management project, and emphasized the eco-tourism potential of turtle conservation at Naran Beach.\nGiving the vote of thanks, Mahmood Akhtar Cheema, Country Representative of IUCN Pakistan, stressed the importance of a collaborative approach to coastal governance and the active involvement of diverse stakeholders in safeguarding and conserving the marine ecosystems.\nHe further emphasised on establishing a dedicated consortium focused on the restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
