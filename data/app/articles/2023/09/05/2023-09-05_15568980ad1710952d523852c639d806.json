The culprit, later named as Muhammad Syed, a 51-year-old Afghan origin man, had also carried out three other killings of a sectarian nature in the area.\n“We are deeply indebted to you for your steadfast support to the community and to the family of late Muhammad Afzal Hussein. It had helped restoring the confidence of diaspora after the tragic incident,” the ambassador said.\nWelcoming the Ambassador, Congresswoman Stansbury noted the presence and important role being played by Pakistani community in socio-economic life of New Mexico.\n“We consider Pakistani community here in New Mexico as a part of the fabric of our culture,” he said.\nShe expressed her deep condolences over the tragic killing of Afzal Hussein stating that he was an ‘extraordinary man”.\n“I don’t know that I’m actually fully recovered from it myself; It was a challenging time and it was definitely a great loss,” she said recalling his contribution towards her campaign and also his help to the communities.\nThe Ambassador also expressed appreciation of the top New Mexico leadership’s commitment to create an enabling environment for minorities in New Mexico to integrate themselves into the mainstream.\nThe Ambassador also shared his proposal for establishing sister-province agreement with New Mexico which was fully endorsed by Ms. Stansburry.\nMasood Khan also extended an invitation to the congresswoman to visit Pakistan which she accepted, the press release added.",
