He submitted that no proceedings could be carried out on the petitions in these circumstances.\nAt this, the bench also agreed with the stance of the prosecutor and dismissed the petitions.\nThe police had registered a case against PTI leaders and workers over attacking Shadman Police Station, under sections of Anti-Terrorism Act and Pakistan Penal Code.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the police added new offences in all the May 9 cases under sections 121 (waging or attempting to wage a war or abetting in waging of war against Pakistan), 131 (abetting mutiny, or attempting to seduce a soldier, sailor or airman from his duty) and 146 (rioting).\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
