  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 11 (APP): Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar paid tribute to Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah for his relentless efforts, wisdom and leadership for securing the rights of Muslims of the sub-continent.\nIn a message on the occasion of the death anniversary of Quaid-e-Azam observed on September 11, he said, “Today is the 75th death anniversary of Quaid-e-Azam and on this day the whole nation pays tribute to him for achieving rights for Muslims of sub-continent with his untiring efforts, sagacity and leadership qualities.” He said without the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam it was not possible to realize the dream of an independent state for Muslims.\nThe PM said the struggle of Quaid was not only against the scheme of usurping the rights of minorities on the basis of the numerical strength of a majority but also for reviving the social, economic, political and civilizational identity and a unique way of life of Muslims as a separate nation and to achieve a prominent status for them in the comity of nations.\nHe noted that the life of Quaid-e-Azam was a practical demonstration of golden principles of constitutional struggle, political farsightedness, faith, unity and discipline, adding in the Quaid of Pakistan nobody would have superiority over others on the basis of language, class, religion, or numerical strength.\nHe said the federal constitution of Pakistan truly represented the 14 points of Quaid-e-Azam, under which every unit of the federation without losing its individual uniqueness had equal opportunity for progress and prosperity.\nThe prime minister stated, “Pakistan is passing through a difficult time and more than ever we need to follow the principles of Quaid-e-Azam.\nThere is no better way to pay tribute to Quaid-e-Azam than to follow his golden principles in an effort to create an Islamic welfare state.”\n“We have to shun all our differences and work together day and night for the progress of Pakistan. Let us today renew our pledge made to the soul of Quaid-e-Azam that we will move forward with unity, faith and discipline. May Allah elevate the ranks of our Quaid and give us the strength to follow the golden principles set by him,” he concluded.",
