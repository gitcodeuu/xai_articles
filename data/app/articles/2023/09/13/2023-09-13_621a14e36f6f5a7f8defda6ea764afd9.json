  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 13 (APP): A four-member bench of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), led by Member Sindh Nisar Durrani, has reserved its judgment in the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) intra-party election case.\nBarrister Gohar, the counsel for PTI, requested leniency, stating that the commission has the authority to disregard the matter. It’s worth mentioning that the commission had provided PTI with a two-week period until August 30 to present their arguments in the intra-party election case.\nECP’s Member Nisar Durrani emphasized that the case shouldn’t linger for too long. The Election Commission has already assigned election symbols to the majority of political parties for the forthcoming general elections. Once the arguments conclude, a decision will be made regarding the allocation of election symbols to PTI.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) had summoned the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) bigwigs for not conducting intra-party elections on August 4. Sources divulged that the electoral watchdog had sent a notice to the party for not holding the intra-party elections. The ECP had issued a notice in the name of the PTI chief. The ECP had summoned the PTI leadership at 10 a.m. on Friday.",
