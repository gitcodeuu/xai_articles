The two countries have rendered each other mutual understanding and mutual support and forged an ironclad friendship.\nIn April 2015, the envoy recalled that Chinese President Xi Jinping paid a historic state visit to Pakistan, during which the two sides elevated China-Pakistan bilateral relations to an all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, opening up a new chapter in the development of bilateral ties.\nSince then, President Xi Jinping has met with Pakistani leaders many times and both sides have reached important consensus, which provides the fundamental principles and action guidelines for the development of bilateral relations.\nJiang Zaidong said China-Pakistan relations have maintained a high level of operation and were full of vigor and vitality.\nBoth sides have maintained close high-level exchanges, he said, adding President Xi Jinping sent a message of congratulations to the 10th anniversary of the CPEC, and dispatched his Special Representative, Vice Premier of the State Council of China He Lifeng to visit Pakistan for the celebration. “It fully demonstrates the great importance attached to China-Pakistan relations by our leaders.”\nHe said the Global Development Initiative, Global Security Initiative and Global Civilization Initiative proposed by President Xi Jinping have received positive responses in Pakistan. “The strong guidance of the leaders has set the direction for the development of China-Pakistan relations and steered the way forging ahead.\nThe ambassador said China-Pakistan practical cooperation had achieved fruitful results as the economic and trade cooperation maintained a high level. “China has been Pakistan’s largest trading partner for eight consecutive years and Pakistan’s exports of agricultural products to China have grown rapidly,” he added.\nHe said CPEC has evolved from vision into reality, becoming a vivid testament of the all-weather friendship, and providing important support for building an even closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era.\n“Two sides are committed to jointly building CPEC into a growth corridor, a livelihood-enhancing corridor, an innovation corridor, a green corridor and an open corridor, and carry forward the CPEC with high-quality development,” the envoy maintained.\nCommenting on military exchanges and cooperation between China and Pakistan, he said these continued to deepen as the leaders of the two militaries have maintained good momentum of frequent exchanges and visits.\nThis year, he said, senior leaders of the Pakistani military including Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and Chief of Army Staff visited China successively. “The two militaries have witnessed fruitful cooperation in fields such as joint training and exercises, anti-pandemic cooperation, equipment and technology collaboration, constantly enriching the connotation of bilateral strategic cooperation, making important contributions to safeguarding regional peace and stability.\nThe envoy was of the view that China-Pakistan cultural and people exchanges have continued to expand, adding flights between the two countries have resumed in an orderly manner.\nWhereas, he said, exchanges of visits by scholars, media professionals, religious representatives and other groups have taken place one after another; besides students from the two countries were enthusiastic about studying abroad in each other’s country.  “The people-to-people bond has been further strengthened. This year is the China-Pakistan Year of Tourism Exchanges.”\nHe mentioned that the Gandhara Art Exhibition was successfully held at the Palace Museum in Beijing, injecting new impetus into the people-to-people contacts, tourism cooperation and cultural exchanges between the two countries.\nDespite the complex and challenging external environment, the envoy said the Chinese economy still had strong resilience with tremendous potential. “The fundamentals sustaining China’s long-term growth remain unchanged. China has the confidence, the conditions and the ability to promote the continuous optimization of its economic structure, continuous enhancement of its growth momentum, and continuous improvement of development trends.”\nHe expressed confidence that China would accelerate efforts to foster a new development paradigm, pursue high-quality development in a comprehensive way, and contribute more positive energy to global economic recovery. “China’s development will undoubtedly create new opportunities for China-Pakistan cooperation.”\nJiang Zaidong said China viewed its relations with Pakistan from a strategic and long-term perspective, and Pakistan always remained a high priority in China’s neighborhood diplomacy.\n“I am ready to work with friends from all walks of life in China and Pakistan, by implementing the important consensus reached by President Xi Jinping and Pakistani leaders as the guiding principle, building a closer China-Pakistan community with a shared future in the new era as the main line, and promoting high-quality development of the CPEC as the major platform, to continuously consolidate, deepen and expand China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperation, safeguard our common interests against changes unseen in a century, and better benefit the two countries and the two peoples.",
