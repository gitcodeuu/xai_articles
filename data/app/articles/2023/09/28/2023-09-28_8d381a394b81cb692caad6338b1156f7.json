He stressed that India should implement the UN Security Council Resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir so that the Kashmiri people may realize their inherent right to self-determination.\nForeign Minister Jilani stated that Pakistan was willing to resolve all disputes with India through dialogue. However, India would have to create a conducive environment for dialogue by reversing its illegal and unilateral actions of August 5, 2019 in IIOJK.\nThe Foreign Minister also lauded the role of the visiting MPs in strengthening the bonds of friendship between Pakistan and the United Kingdom.\nThe members of the delegation expressed concern over the human rights violations in IIOJK. They maintained that all other human rights flowed from the right to self-determination. Therefore, the Kashmiri people should not be deprived of this inalienable right.",
