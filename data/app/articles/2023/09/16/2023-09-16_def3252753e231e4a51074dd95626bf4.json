  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 16 (APP): Caretaker Minister for Information and Broadcasting Murtaza Solangi on Saturday said a news story published by the Dawn Newspaper regarding Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar’s recent interaction with the media was “out of context.”\nSolangi, in a video message, contradicted the news statement attributed to the prime minister by Dawn newspaper on “one-party rule”.\nAccording to Solangi, the publication of this news led to unnecessary comments from many journalists and created a false impression in certain sections of the media, suggesting that martial law was being imposed in the country.\nHe emphasized that some journalists drew conclusions from a statement that the prime minister had not made.\nExpressing his disappointment, Solangi pointed out that this was not the first time Dawn newspaper had published an inaccurate news story.\nHe also recalled a recent false news story by Dawn that had damaged the country’s image on the international stage.\nSolangi lamented that a respected newspaper had been consistently publishing incorrect news.\nHe underscored the media’s right to criticize but stressed that attributing statements to individuals that they did not make was not in line with responsible journalism and freedom of expression.",
