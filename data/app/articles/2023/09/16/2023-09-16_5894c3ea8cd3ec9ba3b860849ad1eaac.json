The initiative would also facilitate disaster management authorities in carrying out relief efforts in affected areas.\nSolangi expressed his gratitude to the DRM Consortium, especially Chairperson Ruxandra Obreja, for their cooperation in introducing DRM technology in Pakistan.\nHe expressed hope that continued collaboration between the DRM Consortium, Radio Pakistan’s management, and engineers would lead to a successful digital rollout in the near future.\nThe minister said with this historic achievement, a new chapter was added to Radio Pakistan’s glorious and historic 76-year journey.\nHe congratulated the current Director General of Radio Pakistan and the DRM Steering Committee for their unwavering dedication and hard work, noting that their efforts were turning a dream into reality.",
