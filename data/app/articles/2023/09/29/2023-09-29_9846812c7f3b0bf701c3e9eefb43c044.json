Besides, compassion for the poor and needy was also equally important for a successful society as Quran also taught the same repeatedly.\nHe reiterated moral principles were also unavoidable for a successful economy.\nPresident Alvi, who earlier distributed awards among the winners of the writing contest of books on Seeratun Nabi (PBUH) and Naat, said the society needed the motivation to spend their wealth for the welfare of the needy people as had been guided by the Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as well as other prophets.\nEven, the Holy Prophet (PBUH) advised his governors and delegates to remain accessible for the poor and downgrade their living standards to par with those of the people in their respective places.\nCalling the concentration of wealth a poison for society, the president urged the business community to never give up morality in their business dealings.\nHe said the Pakistani society was still reluctant to give women their inheritance right as Islam had strictly warned against such dishonesty.\nThe president also called for the women to contribute to the country’s development and asked the men to ensure a harassment-free environment for their work.\nSimilarly, he also emphasised the promotion of education in the country and lamented the alarming figure of over 20 million out-of-school children.\nIn his address, Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Aneeq Ahmed, highlighting the economic challenges faced by the country, urged the people to discourage the concentration of wealth.\nHe said in the modern world, religion was faced with new challenges including artificial intelligence which could never be overcome without achieving excellence in education.\nAdvocating for an end to the interest-based economy, he urged the Ulema to unite the people and rid them of the disappointment.\nDr Noman of Jamia Binoria said an independent state, the resolution of internal and external issues and peace were prerequisites for economic stability.\nProfessor Dr Hammad Lakhvi called for an end to the interest-based economy and promotion of honesty in business dealings.\nHe also emphasised the importance of skill training to make the nation self-dependent.\nVice Chancellor of Ghazali University Dr Zeeshan Ahmed said the system of zakat and sadqaat introduced by Islam was an ideal one to bring in sustainability in the lives of the poor.\nHe said through his teachings, the Holy Prophet brought an end to the capitalist mentality.\nAllam Razi Jafar urged the affluent class to spend their riches for welfare of the needy class and urged the government to cultivate the barren land to create earning opportunities for the have-nots.",
