  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 29 (APP): Caretaker Interior Minister Sarfaraz Ahmed Bugti on Friday addressing at Seerat-ul-Nabi Muhammad (peace be upon him) conference said that 12 Rabi-ul-Awwal is a day of mercy for the whole world.\nWelcoming all scholars and delegates from all over the country to the conference, Bugti said that the image of the state in Islam is a gift given by the Holy Prophet (pbuh).\nHe said that the human character only makes the society better but the main problem in the society is corruption which must be eradicated as the corruption has hollowed out the roots of the country.\nBugti said that according to Islamic traditions, commercial rules will have to be formulated because progress is possible only by following the principles given by the Holy Prophet (pbuh).\nIn the present era, the role of scholars is very important, said the minister adding that Pakistan is a nuclear power that will not be allowed to weaken. Foreign policy was destroyed under organized conspiracy, he added.\nHe said, there was a conspiracy to weaken the country through extremism in the name of religion but the fact is that the minorities have religious freedom in Pakistan and they are living peacefully.\n“We are all Muslims and Pakistanis,” said Bugti.\nHe urged the scholars to project the life and character of the Holy Prophet (pbuh) into society.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
