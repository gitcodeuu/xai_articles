  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 29 (APP):Speakers at a seminar while voicing their serious concern over India’s settler colonialism have said that intensifying settler colonialism posed a grave threat to Kashmiris’ existence.\nThe seminar was hosted by the Community Human Rights Advocacy Center on the 54th session of UNHCR and was attended and addressed by international law experts, academicians, rights activists, and parliamentarians hailing from different parts of the world including Senator Naela Chohan, Dr Imtiyaz Khan, Robert Fantina, Prof. Dr Syed Manwar Hussain, Dr Waleed Rasool, Syed Muhammad Ali, Advocate Parvez Ahmed Shah and others.\nThe event was moderated by KIIR chairman Altaf Hussain Wani.\nDiscussing the trajectory of the occupation, Annexation, and Settler Colonialism of Kashmir, the speakers said that the Indian policies of assimilation and annihilation had a linear relationship in pattern with those of the colonizing states, received a press release from Geneva.\nThey said that the territory of Jammu and Kashmir was occupied by India illegally in 1947 and then annexed on August 5, 2019, in clear contravention of the UNSC resolutions and other international covenants.\nThey said that after the annexation and dissolution of the disputed territory, the phenomenon of settler colonialism was in full play in the region. The speakers pointed out that the Indian government’s goal of settler-colonization was the removal and erasure of Indigenous people’s identity and dislodging them of their resources, land, and other resources.\nThey said that following the annexation of the state under the controversial ‘Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act’, New Delhi took a series of steps that included balkanization, revoking special status, and abolishing Article 35-A.\nThey said that Article 35-A, which protected the state-subject rights and privileges of the people of the Kashmiris, was struck down by the Indian parliament with malicious intent to bring structured changes to establish Kashmir as a settler colony of India.\nThe speakers said that changes in the state’s nomenclature and extensive modifications in the state’s age-old laws have led to further dis-empowerment, disenfranchisement, and systematic marginalization of the indigenous population besides creating a sense of fear and insecurity.\nThey said that New Delhi’s settler-colonialism project in Kashmir coupled with policies of degradation, dehumanization, and demographic shifts, severely threaten peace and security in the region.\nThey said that the aggression and expansionist designs of the Indian government not only pose a threat to the Kashmiris’ existence but also to the sovereignty of small nations bordering India.\nReferring to the UN charter, ICCPR, and ICESR, They said that the Indian policies were in violation of the UN charter.\nThey said that the UN Charter of 1947 not only established the rights of Indigenous people but also their fundamental right, the right to self-determination.\nThey regrettably noted that India was emerging as a brute colonizer in the region.\n“The country that sought freedom from British colonialism is now following the footprints of the colonizers to deprive Kashmiris of their basic rights”, they said.\n“The colonial mindset was reviving in India in the same pattern but more lethal than the British as a colonizer,” they added.\n“It is only by the power of the gun by which the RSS-influenced Hindu supremacist regime is hell-bent on controlling Kashmir and its people,” they said.\nThey said, “Despite India’s claims of normalcy, a startling reign of lawlessness in the region has reached its climax.”\n“Human rights abuses ranging from mass killings, forced disappearances, torture, rape, and harassment to suppression of freedom of speech and bans on religious gatherings are still an ongoing issue in the region”, the speakers said.\nThey said that it was high time that the international community took effective notice of the Indian-settler colonialism in the region and played its much-needed role in stopping the assimilation and annihilation of Kashmiris by India.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
