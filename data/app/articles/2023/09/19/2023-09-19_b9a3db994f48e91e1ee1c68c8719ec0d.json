It was presided over by Pro-Vice Chancellor Prof. Rafique Memon with former Senator Nisar Memon as chief guest, a news release said.\nWelcoming the participants, Prof. Mukhtar Mahar, DG Coastal & Deltaic Studies said, “Today’s objectives are to unite all delta stakeholders to identify issues, challenges and opportunities towards evolving local, provincial, national, regional and global programs under a proposed new United Nations Convention for the Conservation of River Delta (UN-CCRD).”\nDr Engr. Syed Raghib Abbas Shah, former WAPDA chairman and founding senior executive committee member of WEForum shared detailed status of Indus River water in Pakistan with its per capita water availability going dangerously below 1000 cubic meters. Thus, the need to conserve and develop water for drinking, industrial and agricultural use. In addition, “Pakistan must improve its water governance to ensure timely water distribution to all, release needed water flow from upstream to downstream Indus and discharge fresh water to sea for preserving ecology of delta for livelihood of deltaic people.”\nPro Altaf Siyal, dean of Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam explained at length the historic perspective of depleting Indus delta with all scientific studies carried on so far.\nHe alerted the participants of the climate change phenomenon severely affecting communities with seawater intrusion, shoreline changes and degradation of Indus delta. He called upon all, specially governments, to resolve issues on urgent basis for protecting the delta community facing agricultural and food challenges.\nKhuda Bukhsh, Yasmin Shah, Ahmed Khan, Ghulab Shah, and Engr. Obhayo Khushk representing welfare department, fisherfolk, rural support organization, old port of Ketibandar, irrigation and research shared their concerns about Indus and its delta which now pose existentialist threats to people of Sindh specifically Indus deltaic people.\nThey called upon governments, parliament and experts at responsible positions to intervene “to save the dying delta”.\nThe Community Expert Mir Mohammad Baloch said, “The government should also invite the community in their planning process for proper resource allocation towards addressing their issues and challenges.”\nWEForum chairman Nisar Memon in his ‘Way Forward’ remarks thanked all participants for joining this dialogue and coming forward unitedly to save Indus deltaic life.\nHe was pleased that individuals as well as institutions like Sindh University Thatta, Sindh Agriculture University Tandojam, Mehran TV and others have partnered with WEForum. “We are glad Yasmin Shah daughter of Fisher Folk leader Mohammed Ali Shah is amongst us and committed to carry on her late father’s mission,” he added.\nMemon said that the views expressed today will be part of a report and we shall meet next with Sindh government, federal government as well as with UN.
