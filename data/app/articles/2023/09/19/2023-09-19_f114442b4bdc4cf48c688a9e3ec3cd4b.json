  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 19 (APP): The Pakistan Air Force (PAF) contingent on Tuesday landed back at an operational air base of Pakistan Air Force after successful participation in Shaheen-X air exercise in China.\nThe contingent included PAF’s J-10 C and JF-17 lead fighter aircraft, Combat Pilots, Air Defence Controllers, and technical ground crew, who remained actively engaged in the exercise, a PAF news release said.\nThe exercise was aimed at validating interoperability in the face of realistic contemporary air combat scenarios between the two strategic allies.\nShaheen-X is the 10th in the series of Shaheen Air Exercises, annually held in both the countries on an alternate basis.\nThe series of air exercises between Pakistan Air Force and People’s Liberation Army Air Force is rooted in their enduring partnership.\nThe collaborative endeavour has not only facilitated the exchange of valuable insights and lessons learned but has also served as a catalyst for enhancing inter-operability among the combat crews of both Air Forces.\nThe combined efforts of PAF’s crew coupled with the formidable air combat capabilities of J-10 C and JF-17 aircraft, have been instrumental in achieving remarkable success in this challenging exercise.\nThe successful participation of PAF air and ground crew in Shaheen series air exercises is reflective of the sound foothold of operational training of PAF personnel in line with the latest developments in aerial warfare in the face of shared challenges.",
