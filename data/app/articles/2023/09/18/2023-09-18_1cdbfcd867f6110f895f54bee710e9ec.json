  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 18 (APP): The Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination (MoCCC) and UAE’s Blue Carbon on Monday collaborated to unlock economic potential in forestry, aligned with global climate goals, with a focus on carbon reduction projects and their community benefits.\nThe Ministry of Climate Change recently hosted a four-day technical workshop with UAE’s Blue Carbon, attended by representatives from the provincial forestry departments, Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) and Gilgit-Baltistan, a news release said.\nThe workshop’s main goal was to explore how Pakistan’s Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector can generate carbon credits known as Internationally Transferable Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs) under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.\nThroughout the workshop, the primary focus was on exploring potential projects to reduce carbon emissions within Pakistan’s AFOLU sector, with a specific emphasis on its forests. The in-depth conversations that occurred during these sessions illuminated Pakistan’s forest resources and their readiness for Article 6 mechanisms, thereby highlighting potential areas of cooperation with Blue Carbon.\nUnder the guidelines of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, Pakistan’s environmental assets were emphasized as valuable tools to tackle both environmental and economic challenges within the emerging compliance market.\nBlue Carbon, headquartered in the UAE, was founded with the esteemed support of Sheikh Ahmed Dalmook Al Maktoum, a member of the UAE royal family. Utilizing the UAE’s visionary approach to development and entrepreneurship, Blue Carbon specializes in crafting systems and resources that facilitate social development endeavors for both private enterprises and countries seeking to improve their environmental assets. Blue Carbon stands out by offering end-to-end development and facilitation services for carbon projects, particularly in the realm of ITMOs.\nOne important conclusion drawn from these conversations was the recognition that starting projects in forestry could set the stage for future endeavors in various sectors, ultimately enhancing Pakistan’s sustainable development and economic prospects.\nIn addition to carbon reduction, the meetings emphasized the vital supplementary advantages of climate adaptation services and support for community livelihoods within these mitigation-based projects. Given Pakistan’s continuous battle with the adverse effects of climate change and the substantial dependence of local communities on forest resources, the significance of these additional benefits is immeasurable.\nThe joint effort undertaken by Blue Carbon and Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination, in collaboration with provincial forestry department representatives/AJK/GB, represents a significant milestone in the worldwide fight against climate change. This collaborative initiative positions Pakistan to harness the economic potential within its natural forest resources while harmonizing with the overarching goals of the Paris Agreement.",
