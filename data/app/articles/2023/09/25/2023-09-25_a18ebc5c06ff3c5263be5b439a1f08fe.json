  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 25 (APP):The Transfer Agreement Signing Ceremony for the ex-Pakistan Navy Ship TARIQ to Falls of Clyde International (FOCI), UK took place at the Pakistan High Commission in London on Monday.\nThis ship, formerly decommissioned by the Pakistan Navy on August 4, 2023, has been donated by the Government of Pakistan to FOCI for conversion into a floating museum.\nIt will be displayed at the Clyde Maritime Heritage Center in Glasgow, symbolizing the common naval heritage shared by the Royal Navy and the Pakistan Navy, according to a press release received here.\nThe Transfer Agreement Signing Ceremony was witnessed by Chief of the Naval Staff of the Pakistan Navy Admiral Muhammad Amjad Khan Niazi Nishan-e-Imtiaz (military) and Sitara-e-Basalat, as the Chief Guest, and Admiral Lord Alan West who was the Guest of Honour at the event. Besides, the ceremony was attended by David O’Neill, Director of FOCI, veterans from the Royal Navy, and representatives of the Pakistani community in the UK.\nDuring his address to the audience, Chief of Naval Staff expressed confidence that the donation of TARIQ to FOCI would further strengthen the bonds of friendship between the UK and Pakistan, with the ship continuing to symbolize the shared maritime history of our respective navies in the years ahead.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Admiral Lord Alan West said “The close relationship between the Navies and Nations of Pakistan and the UK are clearly shown by this historic agreement focused on one ship that fought and represented each country over many years.”\nThe history of ex-PNS TARIQ is noteworthy, having served in the Royal Navy as HMS AMBUSCADE for 18 years, including during the Falklands War, before being integrated into the Pakistan Navy as PNS TARIQ in 1993.\nOver the course of more than three decades in the Pakistan Navy, the ship earned a reputation for its versatility, agility, and readiness in combat. Notably, it played a crucial role in a Search and Rescue mission during the 2005 Indian Ocean Tsunami in the Maldives, saving the lives of 377 tourists from various nationalities.",
