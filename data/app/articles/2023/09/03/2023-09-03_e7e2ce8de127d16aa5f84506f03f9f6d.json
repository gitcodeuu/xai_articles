The positive sample in Rawalpindi indicates that the virus was circulating in the region, though no positive case had been reported so far, he said and added that “If a single case is reported in a region, it remains a threat to children residing in 200 houses in the vicinity.\nMeanwhile, Commissioner Rawalpindi Liaquat Ali Chatta directed the official concerned to improve the anti-polio micro plan devised during the previous campaign.\nHe said the crippling disease was a national issue, and it was the responsibility of all to play an influential role in making the country polio-free.\nThe Commissioner warned the officials that strict action would be taken against those responsible for fake entries. Liaquat said hiding facts was not a solution to any problem, but it complicated the issue.\nLaiquat further directed to cover the missing and refusal cases by convincing the parents with the help of local community leaders and achieving the target set for the drive.\nHe urged the citizens, particularly the parents, to come forward and play their role in eliminating the crippling disease from society.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
