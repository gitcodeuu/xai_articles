  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 27 (APP): The Embassy of Azerbaijan in Islamabad, observed “Remembrance Day” to honor the soldiers and officers who valiantly fought in the Patriotic War, reclaimed Azerbaijani territories, and made the ultimate sacrifice for the territorial integrity of their country.\nDuring a book presentation ceremony titled “The History of Patriotic War – Personality Factor and to Celebrate the Day,” Ambassador Khazar Farhadov recounted the history of the conflict and highlighted Azerbaijan’s resilience in the face of nearly three decades of illegal occupation by Armenia.\nHe emphasized that Armenia had continuously engaged in provocations against Azerbaijan during this period.\nAmbassador Farhadov further elaborated on the pivotal moment that occurred on September 27, 2020, when Azerbaijan launched a counter-offensive in response to Armenia’s large-scale military attack on Azerbaijani Army positions and civilian settlements.\nUnder the leadership of President Ilham Aliyev, the Azerbaijani Armed Forces successfully liberated Azerbaijani territories from Armenian occupation, ultimately leading to Armenia’s capitulation.\nIn remembrance of the brave martyrs who fought for their nation’s territorial integrity, September 27th is now observed as Remembrance Day in Azerbaijan every year.\nLocal anti-terror measures were initiated to ensure compliance with the Trilateral Statement, disarm and withdraw Armenia’s armed forces from Azerbaijani territories, and secure the safety of civilians and military personnel. These measures strictly targeted legitimate military objectives, with an emphasis on protecting the civilian population.\nFollowing intense negotiations, the armed forces of Armenia and illegal armed groups surrendered after 23 hours and 53 minutes.\nHowever, Azerbaijan mourned the loss of martyrs not only during the 44-day Patriotic War but also during anti-terror measures and Armenian provocations in subsequent years.\nAmbassador Farhadov expressed gratitude to Pakistan for its unwavering moral and political support throughout the conflict and during the local anti-terror measures.\nHe noted that Pakistan’s support had been highly appreciated by the Government and people of Azerbaijan.\nThe Ambassador highlighted Azerbaijan’s commitment to reconstruction and restoration efforts in the liberated areas, allocating billions of dollars to this endeavor.\nMany former internally displaced persons (IDPs) have already returned to revitalized regions such as Fuzuli, Zangilan, and Lachin, with plans for additional families to relocate to their homeland.\nNotably, Fuzuli and Zangilan International Airports have been constructed, and work on Lachin International Airport is underway.\nAzerbaijan’s cultural capital, Shusha, and Aghdam have become venues for international events, symbolizing the resurgence of these regions.\nEven the “Pakistan Colors” group performed the “Bhangra” dance at the 5th “Kharibulbul” International Folklore Festival held in Shusha in May 2022.\nAmbassador Farhadov extended his appreciation to Pakistani media representatives for their support in raising awareness of Azerbaijan’s realities among the Pakistani public and on the international stage.\nAmbassador Farhadov discussed the Western Azerbaijan Community, which was established in 1989 to protect the rights of Azerbaijanis expelled from their ancestral homeland, now known as Armenia.\nHe highlighted the historical injustices suffered by Azerbaijanis, including ethnic cleansing, violence, and mass deportations.\nThe Ambassador emphasized the urgent need for a legally binding international agreement to enable the return of Azerbaijanis expelled from Armenia to their homes and to ensure their individual and collective rights, as this is essential for lasting peace in the region",
