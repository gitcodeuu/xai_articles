I now feel more confident in approaching financial institutions for support to expand my business.” Trainee and owner of the Plastibility business Sakina Afridi, said.\nThrough the impartation of these indispensable skills, USAID-ERDA aspires to empower women entrepreneurs in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and NMDs, unlocking their potential and propelling the economic development of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and NMDs.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
