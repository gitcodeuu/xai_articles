  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 5 (APP): Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar on Tuesday said that he was “certain” about the general election being held within the next three to four months.\nThe prime minister, asked in an interview with a private television channel, about his strategy if any future scenario demanded an extension in the caretaker setup, he said as per the legal arrangement they would move to the electoral process within three to four months.\n“I think within few months… few months can be translated into three, three-and-half or four…that needs to be seen…this will conclude and we will go to the electoral process,” he commented.\nAsked again whether he expected the general elections to be held within four months, he replied, ” I am not (just) hopeful (rather) I am certain.”\nHe said considering the limited time, his government was mulling to prioritize certain policy issues to at least lay a foundation for any future government to enable that to carry forward the journey.\nTo a question, the prime minister explained that even after the expiry of the term, the President of Pakistan could continue in his office till the election of his replacement. However, the Senate chairman would fill the slot, in case he voluntarily gives up the office.\nComing to the issue of electricity bills, the prime minister said the government was coming up with short and mid-term solutions including the planning to convert the oil-based power plants to run on local coal.\nBesides, the process for the privatization of one or two power Discos will also be finalised soon which would help curb power theft through the introduction of new technology, and would also attract investment.\nHe said besides power Discos, the privatization of some important state-owned enterprises was also being processed.\nRegarding the sugar price hike, Prime Minister Kakar said the government had asked the provinces to activate the price control committees and that the hoarders would be cracked down.\nThe prime minister said through the legislation, the previous government had empowered the caretaker setup which necessitated them to act differently from the normal caretaker setup.\nThe prime minister told the interviewer that the Special Investment Facilitation Council had been formed as a forum to address the concerns impeding the investment projects.\nHe said Saudi Arabia, UAE, Qatar and Bahrain had sent proposals and due diligence was being done which would follow the signing of formal agreements by November or December.\nHe said the level of commitment by civil and military leadership and bureaucratic energy would help attract the investment as in the past, the fear of NAB inquiries created an environment of indecisiveness.\nTo a question, the prime minister said the government and the military had a very comfortable working environment.\nHe said that besides the army chief, he along with the finance minister had also had a detailed sitting with industrialists in Karachi and was also planning to hold a similar meeting in Lahore.",
