Our operation against terrorists would continue unabated and the Armed Forces, Intelligence and Law Enforcement Agencies shall not rest till the menace of terrorism is rooted out from the country”.\nThe COAS emphasised, “People of Pakistan have rejected terrorists’ pseudo ideology and propaganda of their backers and they are fully committed to peace, economic progress & human development which indeed is causing a lot of distress to forces of evil in and outside of Pakistan”.\nThe Army Chief visited CMH Quetta, where he met the injured and families of the Mastung incident who are being provided full medical care by the Pakistan Army.\nHe also lauded the bravery and resilience of Balochistan Police and Law Enforcement personnel. He assured full cooperation and support to the families of shuhada and assured them that terrorists, their abettors and facilitators will not be spared.\nEarlier on arrival, COAS was received by Chief Minister Balochistan and Commander Balochistan Corps.",
