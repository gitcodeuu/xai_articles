They further said India wanted to divert the world’s attention from its internal and external problems through such terrorist incidents.\nThe religious scholars and leaders said they stood united along with the general public against the terrorism and extremism and pledged their full support to the national armed forces and security agencies in their unwavering efforts to eradicate terrorism and maintain peace.\nThey recalled Pakistan’s successful efforts in exposing and dismantling international terrorist networks operating within its borders reiterating its commitment to counter these sinister designs and pledged to continue their struggle against the enemies of peace and stability.\nIn conclusion, they said Pakistan, its security institutions, political and religious leaders, and the resilient people were resolutely facing the challenges posed by terrorism and they remained determined not to let these conspiracies succeed in destabilizing their nation and region.\nIt is worth mentioning here that Organized by the PUC, a gathering of religious scholars and leaders of all schools of thought and representatives of different religions titled ‘Sirat Rahmatul-lil-Alameen (Peace Be Upon Him) Conference’ would be held at Al Hamra Hall, Shahrah-e-Quaid-e-Azam, Lahore on Sunday.\nThe conference, chaired by PUC Chairman Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi, would be addressed by Council of Islamic Ideology Chairman Dr. Qibla Ayaz, President Church of Pakistan Bishop Azad Marshall, Allama Syed Zia Ullah Shah Bukhari, Maulana Muhammad Khan Laghari, Maulana Rafiq Jami, Maulana Abdul Haq Mujahid and leaders of various religions.\nAccording to details, an action plan against extremism, terrorism and communal violence would be announced in the conference.\nIn another statement, Ulema and Mashaykh of all schools of thought were of the view that on the sacred day of Eid Miladun Nabi, Khawariji terrorists had shown their anti-Islam agenda as they targeted the innocent Muslims, who were commemorating the birthday of the beloved Prophet (Peace Be upon Him).\nThe religious scholars and leaders said they chose a sacred day of happiness, peace and pride for this cruel act reflecting their un-Islamic mindset.\nShedding light on their nefarious designs, they hinted that Khawariji terrorists were trying to provoke sectarian issues by targeting peaceful and moderate school of thought – Barelvism. They said symbolic attack on 12th Rabi-ul-Awwal, was meant to instigate sectarian violence between radical and peaceful Muslims.\nThe leaders said the terrorists wanted to add religious or sectarian dimension to violence in Balochistan to expand insecurity beyond sub-nationalist militancy. They said anti-state elements were trying to reduce Chinese trust and confidence in the security environment of Balochistan for sabotaging the ongoing mega projects under China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and future business activities in the region.\nThe religious scholars and leaders categorically stated that, “These heinous acts are committed in the name of Islam by Khawariji but these terrorists have no understanding of the essence of Islam. This is ‘Fisad Fil Ard’. These terrorists are a curse and involved in abhorrent actions against humanity.”\nThey said Khawaiji were trying to tarnish the true image and essence of Islam through their heinous crimes against fellow Muslims and humanity as no Muslim could even think of attacking a mosque, a religious gathering and choosing a sacred day. “This is an anti-Islamic act by enemies of Islam through Khawariji proxy terrorists,” they added.\nUlema and Mashaykh, condemning extremism and terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, pledged to join their hands in cursing these barbaric and loathsome acts against the fellow Muslims.",
