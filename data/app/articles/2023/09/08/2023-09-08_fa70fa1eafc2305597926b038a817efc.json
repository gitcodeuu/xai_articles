Assistant Commissioner Shalimar arrested 15 beggars from the F-10 area.\nThe beggars were arrested and transferred to the police station while the minor children were sent to the Edhi Center, an ICT spokesman Dr Abdullah Tabasum said on Friday.\nThis is not the first time that a crackdown on beggars has been conducted in Islamabad. In recent years, the city has seen a growing number of beggars, many of whom are professional beggars who are not actually in need of help. The latest crackdown is part of the government’s efforts to discourage the growing trend of beggary and make the city a more livable place.\nThe authorities have also said that they will provide assistance to those who are willing to give up begging and find other means of livelihood\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
