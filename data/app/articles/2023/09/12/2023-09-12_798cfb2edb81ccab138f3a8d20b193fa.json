PTCL, a market leader in telecom, is proactively playing its role to bridge the digital divide to bring a positive change in the lifestyle of people.\nSuch partnerships will help achieve that objective by providing futuristic, innovative and cost-effective solutions even in the remotest parts of the country.\nIt will contribute significantly towards stirring the business activity and overall economic growth of the country.”\nOn the occasion, Ali Akhtar, Founder and CEO of DynaSys Networks, said, “The framework that DynaSys and PTCL have formally signed today is a giant leap for materializing IoT in Pakistan. The missing piece of the puzzle so far has been the platform which we have now solved. In the months ahead we will be working hand in glove to materialize Pakistan’s first full-fledged IoT service. On satellite communications, it is natural that the talent of both organizations would gravitate towards each other for a high impact market presence. We’re taking solid steps to dominate this space in Pakistan and to spread out to the broader region.”\nThe MoU aligns the vast technical and commercial expertise of DynaSys’ satellite communications team with PTCL’s extensive satellite communications infrastructure and rich history of satellite services in Pakistan.\nThrough this alliance, both companies not only endeavor to become Pakistan’s largest satellite communications systems integrators and service providers, but also aim to significantly increase market share across the region.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
