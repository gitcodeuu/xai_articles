  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 21 (APP): Head of Agriculture and Coordination, Global Climate-Change Impact Studies Centre (GCISC), Arif Goheer, said on Thursday that developing the adaptation tracking mechanism would not only aid in the national climate change adaptation planning process but would also support preparing the adaptation communication (ADCOM) for the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).\nHe said that, as per the Paris Agreement, all countries were required to produce reliable, transparent, and comprehensive information on GHG emissions, climate action, and support under the Enhanced Transparency Framework.\nHe was speaking during the three-day National Climate Transparency Forum, which was sponsored financially by GIZ Pakistan and coordinated by GCISC, the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination (MoCC & EC), and CITEPA France.\nThe workshop’s objectives are to gain a thorough understanding of the accomplishments and subsequent steps of the transparency project, ensure the visibility of GCISC and GIZ’s commitments to transparency and MVR, facilitate stakeholder engagement, and foster interactions and synergy with other national, sectoral, and local initiatives in the nation.\nThe three-day forum also introduced the launch of Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) for Mitigation and Adaptation Tracking in Pakistan. In this context, a tool called the Climate Transparency Platform for Pakistan has been developed by the joint efforts of CITEPA France and GCISC. Representatives of federal and provincial planning, research, development, implementation, academia, and civil society organizations are participating in the forum.\nArif Goheer appreciated the overwhelming response of provinces in climate transparency-related activities and hoped that the data sharing on climate actions would be streamlined and continued to foster collaboration among all stakeholders involved in mitigating the effects of climate change.\nHe explained that the new internationally adopted framework will enable the implementation of mitigation, adaptation, and support actions, as well as their monitoring over time. This monitoring will be reported on a regular basis as part of the BTR (Biennial Transparency Report), which will replace the BUR (Biennial Updated Report) by 2025.\nIn this context, the inventory of GHG emissions as well as the action monitoring indicators are essential for the monitoring and confidence of the international community. Hence, the national GHG inventory project, which aims at developing a framework for compiling the GHG inventories on a regular basis, is carried out at GCISC, he added.\nHe highlighted the significance of climate change adaptation, stating that adaptation is a critical concern for developing countries, and in particular for Pakistan, owing to the fragility of its ecosystems and its vulnerability to the impacts of climate change.\nThe purpose of day one of the training was to give a brief overview of the transparency platform called RISQ and to know how to link the platform with national communications like TNC, NDC, NAP, etc. Moving on to Day 2, which focuses on the mitigation component of the RISQ tool with specific attention on the assessment of GHG impacts and tracking of mitigation actions, policies, and measures,\nThe mitigation component aims to develop a framework for compiling GHG inventories, data collection, data sharing, data reporting and institutional arrangements, according to the UNFCCC guidelines and Paris Agreement. As we transition to day 3, the emphasis shifts towards enhancing awareness of adaptation M&E systems (which is a relatively new concept) and, getting inputs from the key stakeholders for the development of the M&E System for Adaptation Tracking in the Agriculture and Water Sector.\nDG, Environment, MoCC&EC, Asif Sahibbzada, stated that Pakistan, despite being the 5th largest population in the world and a small contributor to global GHG emissions (less than 1%), is committed to reducing its GHG emissions. He further reiterated that building resilience to climate change is a key focus of the national climate change policy of the government of Pakistan, and the government will ensure its cooperation with national and local agencies.\nIrfan Tariq, a renowned environmentalist and former DG Environment, declared the official launch of the MRV platform a proud moment. He emphasized that partnerships are essential to making the transparency platform efficient and functional. The IT system will enable Pakistan to track climate change actions for transparent reporting and better coordination and communication with local and national agencies, he said.\nHead Climate Programme GIZ, Baptiste Chatre, appreciated the active role of GCISC, being a research arm of MOCC &EC, in spearheading the GHG and transparency activities in particular and climate in general. He mentioned that a developed MRV framework will not only facilitate international reporting but also ensure international financial support for Pakistan on climate change actions.\nGhislaine Guiran, a CITEPA France expert, showed her pleasure in the pace of the project and emphasized the need for robust data for transparency actions.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
