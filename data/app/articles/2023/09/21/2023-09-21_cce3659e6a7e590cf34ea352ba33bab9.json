He said that Islam also taught kindness to humanity, irrespective of their caste and creed.\nSolangi said that anti-peace forces wanted to weaken the power of Pakistan by targeting minorities as diversity was\nPakistan’s strength.\nAll the people of the state of Pakistan enjoyed equal rights, Murtaza Solangi said adding that the promotion and protection of minorities rights on the principle of equality was a major weapon against extremism. He said that time had come to eliminate all types of prejudices from the society as it was one aspect of the ideology of creation of Pakistan.\nThe minister said that 22 years ago in 2001, the United Nations announced to celebrate the International Day of Peace on September 21 every year.
