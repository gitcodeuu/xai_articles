  "content": "FAISALABAD, Sep 21 (APP):Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Human Rights & Women Empowerment Mushaal Hussein Mullick condemned on Thursday India’s destabilising activities in the region through state-sponsored terrorism, aimed at establishing its own hegemony.\nSpeaking to the media after participating in a Mehfil-e-Milad at Government College Women University Faisalabad (GCWUF) on Thursday, she asserted that India was engaged in disseminating venomous propaganda against Pakistan. This was occurring despite India’s own involvement in recent terrorist activities, as revealed in Canada, where RAW officials were reported to have been involved in the killing of a Khalistan movement activist.\nMushaal went on to highlight India’s support for extremist organizations like the RSS, which she claimed was also collaborating with the Indian government and RAW in developing nuclear weapons. She stated that the RSS and RAW had an extensive global network and were allegedly involved in the harassment of Kashmiris and Sikhs not only in Pakistan but also in Australia and Europe.\nHowever, she welcomed Canada’s strong response to the killing of a Sikh leader, asserting that this incident had exposed India’s darker side, as well as the malicious intentions of the Modi government. Mushaal claimed that the Indian government was not only supporting terrorists but also promoting terrorism to suppress the movements for Khalistan and Kashmir freedom.\nShe emphasised that Kashmiris had been struggling for their right to self-determination for the past 75 years, while India continued to use force to deny them their fundamental and constitutional rights. She expressed regret over the silence of the world’s human rights advocates on the pressing issue, describing it as deeply unfortunate.\nResponding to a question, she stated that Kulbhushan Jadhav was an operative of RAW involved in terrorist activities globally, including in Pakistan. He had been deployed to establish a RAW network and promote its activities in Pakistan, particularly in Karachi, Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa (KP), and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA). Jadhav was also involved in terrorist activities in Punjab. Mushaal urged the entire nation to unite in countering Indian propaganda and thwarting its nefarious schemes.\nAddressing another question, Mushaal clarified that the caretaker government consisted of technocrats and was non-political. The responsibility of fixing and announcing election dates lay with the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP). She assured that once the ECP announced the election date, the government would implement it accordingly.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
