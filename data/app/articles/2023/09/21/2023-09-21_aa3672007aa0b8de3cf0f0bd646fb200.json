This method is presented as a potential predictive, simple, and accessible tool to assess the risk of suffering severe pneumonia.\nThe research, published in the ‘European Respiratory Journal’, involved smart phone recordings of voluntary coughing sounds from 70 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection, all recorded within the first 24 hours after their admission to the hospital.\nBarcelona’s Institute for Bioengineering of Catalonia (IBEC) conducted an acoustic analysis of these recordings, which revealed significant differences in cough sounds depending on the severity of the respiratory condition, as previously confirmed by imaging tests and the need for supplemental oxygen.\nThe results indicate that this analysis could be used to categorise Covid patients as mild, moderate, or severe and to monitor patients with persistent Covid-19. The study was conducted using data collected between April 2020 and May 2021 at Hospital del Mar.\nDr. Joaquim Gea, emeritus head of the Pneumology Service, researcher at the Hospital del Mar Research Institute, suggests that these findings can prove beneficial “in regions with limited medical infrastructure or during emergency situations. This approach can aid in the prompt identification and isolation of Covid-19 patients, thus facilitating proper medical care and the implementation of control measures.”\nWhile the study was primarily centred on Covid, it also paves the way for applying this model to other respiratory conditions.",
