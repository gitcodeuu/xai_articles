However, the provinces with a few exceptions lacked the important policy initiative to drive their efforts coherently to address climate change, he added.\nLecturer at National University of Sciences and Technology (NUST), Sheeba Tariq opined that the country needed decentralisation of disaster risk reduction (DRR) rules and regulations at the provincial and district level because the vulnerable community deemed recognition that were neglected in every policy initiative.\n“Women empowerment should be part and parcel of development strategies as the current policy initiatives lacked women responsive strategies and policies which should have bottom-up approach,” she added.\nSheeba Tariq noted that there was phaseout plan for coal-fired power plants under CPEC amid its 60% renewable energy transformation goal alongwith that the Electric Vehicle transition agenda also had no plan for lithium batteries’ disposal or waste management that was environmentally hazardous.\nDeputy Manager, the National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF), Mujahid Afzal said the barrier to implementation of climate change policy in the country was finances which could not be managed from its own resources but rather possible through the international community’s support.\nHe highlighted that due to the demographics of the country that varied due to diverse communities, the concept of community development varied from region to region and therefore should be handled in separate manner in different areas of the country.\nAfzal said the simulation exercises intended to bolster disaster preparedness and resilience of the local communities against disasters help prepare for the worst. He added that the forecasted floods in the future were of enormous magnitude that were far disastrous then the previous one we have been facing for the past two decades.\n“The most imminent threat to the country is climate change that will leave our population out of food if its swathes of crops were washed away by mighty floods. We are left with no time to do indigenous research but to import research, test it and implement it,” he said.\nCEO, Resilient Future International (RFI), Aftab Alam Khan said it was time to think beyond the Ministry of Climate Change and NDRMF for institutional capacity building as the county needed a cross-sectoral approach in terms of mitigation and loss and damage.\nThe role of Commerce and Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) needed to be looked into as it took many years to get international climate finance, he said, adding, “We need to have an active Commerce Ministry and MoFA as climate finance globally had a political interest attached to it.”\nHe referred to the third transitional committee on loss and damage fund held at Dominic Republic where one proposal from developed countries said that the less developed countries and small island countries should only get loss and damage fund which could have made Pakistan ineligible. “MoFA should have to play it’s role there as the last meeting of the transitional committee will be held in October which will send the final recommendations for COP-28 consideration,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
