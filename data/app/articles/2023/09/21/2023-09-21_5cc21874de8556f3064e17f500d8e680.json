  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 21 (APP): Caretaker Minister for Information and Broadcasting Murtaza Solangi on Thursday said conducting free, fair and transparent elections was the mandate of the caretaker government.\nAll-out assistance, including resources, administrative assistance and security, would be provided to the Election Commission of Pakistan to hold the general elections within the given time-frame, the minister said while talking to a private channel.\nHe said the ECP was responsible for providing a level-playing field to all political parties.\nHe said it was clearly stated in the Constitution that the country would be run by the elected representatives.\nThe minister expressed the resolve to ensure implementation of the electoral watchdog’s instructions.\nTo a query, he termed the objections on Minister for Privatization Fawad Hassan Fawad “wrong and baseless”. If he had association with anyone he would not have become a minister for three to four months, he added.\nAs regards the ongoing crackdown against power thieves, he said the drive would not only reduce the circular debt significantly, but also provide relief to the masses.\nHe said the caretaker government had legal authority to carry out privatization of those state-owned entities which were approved by the previous regime.",
