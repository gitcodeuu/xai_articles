He acknowledged that contemporary challenges such as Islamophobia, climate change, and increasing secularism required concerted efforts and dialogue with non-Muslim communities.\nMinister Aneeq underscored the significance of fostering dialogue and understanding with non-Muslims, portraying it as a battle against ignorance rather than a clash of civilizations. He stressed that Islam promoted humanity and service to all without any discrimination as “the duty to serve is essence of faith.”\nFurthermore, both leaders expressed their mutual desire to promote dialogue at governmental and religious leader levels. In a collaborative effort, they announced the establishment of a ‘Seerat Museum’ in Pakistan, with the support of MWL, aimed at preserving and promoting Islamic heritage.\nSecretary-General Dr. Mohmmad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa commended Pakistan’s role as a crucial Islamic nation and recognized its unwavering commitment to the Islamic world. He affirmed that Pakistan’s contributions to the Muslim Ummah should never be underestimated.\nDr. Al-Issa also revealed plans for laying the foundation stone of the ‘Seerat Museum’ during his visit to Pakistan in November, solidifying the collaboration between Pakistan and the MWL.",
