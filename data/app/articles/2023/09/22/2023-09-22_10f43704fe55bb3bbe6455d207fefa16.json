  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 22 (APP): Pakistan Ulema Council Chairman, Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mahmood Ashrafi, on Friday emphasized that unity among Islamic countries was the key to addressing issues such as Palestine, Kashmir, Islamophobia and other challenging concerns.\nSpeaking to the media, he said leaders of Turkey, Qatar, and Iran raised their voices against the desecration of the Holy Quran during the United Nations General Assembly, highlighting the need to protect global peace, considering the emotions of over two billion Muslims worldwide.\nAshrafi said Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s recent interview had made it clear that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had not been oblivious to the Palestine issue in the past, and it remained committed to playing a role in resolving both the Kashmir and Palestine issues as the head of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\nHe further stated that the leaders of these three Islamic nations – Turkey, Qatar, and Iran – had criticized the West strongly for attempting to desecrate copies of the Holy Quran, pointing out that Islamophobia, including racism, was spreading like a plague in Western countries.\nHe said this alarming trend of unwarranted provocations was not only sabotaging international efforts for interfaith harmony but also posing a threat to global peace. He said several Western countries and politicians were capitalizing on this dangerous trend, continually fanning the flames.\nAshrafi said these provocative acts were inflaming the emotions of over two billion Muslims, urging leaders in the West to understand the gravity of such condemned actions and put an end to the examination of Muslims through such disgraceful acts.\nIn response to a question, he said Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in his recent interview had categorically stressed the importance of resolving the Palestine issue and improving the lives of Palestinians.\nHe also mentioned that Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan had expressed his principled stance on Kashmir issue at the United Nations.\nThe Saudi foreign minister made it clear to the international community that the Kingdom stood with Muslim nations, including the Kashmir issue and wanted to get it resolved in accordance with international agreements, treaties, and laws, he maintained.",
