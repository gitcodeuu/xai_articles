  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 22 (APP):The Pakistan Information Commission (PIC) has ruled that Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Service Corporation (PASSCO) is a public body under the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017.\nAccording to the press release, this decision emphasizes the dedication to transparency and the fundamental right of citizens to access essential information.\nThe ruling comes in response to an appeal titled ‘Naeem Sadiq Vs Pakistan Agriculture Storage and Service Corporation,’ which led to the Commission issuing a comprehensive judgment”\nThe Commission’s order clarifies that PASSCO, even though it holds the status of a corporate commercial entity as a Public Limited Company with 75% of its capital held by commercial banks and 25% by the Federal Government, performs a substantial public role.\nThe Federal Government holds administrative authority over PASSCO, as established by Rule of Business (Entry No. 31). In accordance with Section 2 (ix) (d), (g), and (h) of the RTI Act, 2017, this unequivocally categorizes PASSCO as a public entity.\nThe Commission also discussed the reference (2002 PLC (C.S) 1650) mentioned by PASSCO in its written statement, underscoring that this case pertained to an employee dispute rather than the organizational status of PASSCO.\nThe Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled that, for certain purposes, PASSCO employees are deemed to be “civil servants.” However, when PASSCO is both administratively controlled by the Federal Government and performs public functions, it unquestionably falls within the definition of a public body under the RTI Act.\nThe Commission firmly rejected PASSCO’s claim that it does not qualify as a public body under Section 2 (ix) of the Right of Access to Information Act, 2017.\nIn line with this ruling, the Pakistan Information Commission has directed PASSCO to provide the requested information to the appellant within 10 working days, ensuring the protection of citizens’ right to access vital information held by public bodies.\nThis decision represents a significant step in strengthening transparency, accountability, and citizens’ rights to access information in Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
