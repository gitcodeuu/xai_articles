The second phase of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) had also been initiated covering railway, infrastructure, and manufacturing projects.\n“Pakistan also looks forward to the early implementation of the ‘connectivity’ projects with Central Asia,” he added.\nHe said Pakistan was situated in one of the least economically integrated regions in the world. “Pakistan believes that regions develop together, therefore, Pakistan desires peaceful and productive relations with all our neighbours, including India. Kashmir is the key to peace between Pakistan and India,” he added.",
