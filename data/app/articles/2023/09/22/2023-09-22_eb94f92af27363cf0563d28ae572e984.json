  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 22 (APP): The state-of-the-art olive processing unit, established by the Pakistan Poverty Alleviation Fund (PPAF) in the Lower Dir district, has successfully processed this season’s first batch of olives, yielding an impressive 12% oil ratio.\nAccording to the PPAF, the unit has been established in Lower Dir district, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with funding from the Italian Government through the Agency for Development Cooperation (AICS) under the Programme for Poverty Reduction (PPR).\nAs the season progresses, this ratio will increase to 18 percent, resulting in an average income of Rs. 36,000 for every 18 litres of oil produced from 100 kg of olives. This project has succeeded with the support of the on-ground partner Sarhad Rural Support Programme (SRSP).\nLower Dir is rich in olive cultivation and the provision of an oil pressing unit has played a significant role in revitalizing the olive value chain. This initiative is creating sustainable livelihood opportunities for local producers while boosting their income.\nOlive oil offers numerous benefits for health as it helps improving the cardiovascular system, reduction in depression risk, maintain healthy cholesterol levels and curing Alzheimer’s disease.\nOlive oil also helps in preventing stroke, reducing breast cancer risk, protecting from ulcerative colitis, curing acute pancreatitis, and strengthening bones.",
