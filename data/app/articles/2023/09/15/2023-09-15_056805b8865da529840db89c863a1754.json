He also appreciated the civil and military bureaucracy for successfully launching the drive.\nHe pointed out that with regard to the recovery, pursuance of law enforcement agencies was visible in the ongoing drive. Before that, he said there was inertia and laxity in this regard as there was no sense of ownership.\nHe said to reverse this kind of trend, the government was adopting whole of the government approach to conclude the drive to its logical end.\n“We have capable civil servants, police officers and the military which is one of the most disciplined institution and whenever we will need their services to improve the governance, we will make use of them,” he remarked.\nBut in the long run, he said the solution to challenges of Pakistan’s governance was that the civil servants should gradually improve their performance.\nPM Kakar said when their performance would be improved, the extra space being occupied but the law enforcement agencies would automatically be subside.\n“I am very much sure that they [the law enforcement agencies] have no deliberate intention to occupy the space of other organizations.”\nHe said the intention was always that the functionality of the governance should be maintained. “At least the functionality of the state should remain relatively normal and in this connection this meeting is a milestone.”\nHe also stressed to correct the overall attitude of the governance.\nThe prime minister said as soon as the performance of the civil servants was improved, their writ, respect, and their branding would automatically improved. “This is possible only through collective efforts”, he added.",
