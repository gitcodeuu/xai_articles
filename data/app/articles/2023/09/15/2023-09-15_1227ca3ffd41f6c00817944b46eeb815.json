As the world becomes more interconnected, so such collaborations play an important role in preparing students to become global citizens, equipped with knowledge, understanding and appreciation for different cultures” he added.\nBoth parties are excited about the potential impact of this collaboration and are eager to begin the initial stages of the program.\nHowever, more details about the exam schedule, syllabus, and registration process will be released in the coming weeks.",
