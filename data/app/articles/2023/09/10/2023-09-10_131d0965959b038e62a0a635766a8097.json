  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 10 (APP): In a crackdown on profiteers, Assistant Commissioner Pothohar Nahel Hafiz on Sunday sealed five shops, and seized 100 KG sugar for selling at exorbitant prices in H-13, Golra Morr and Jhangi Syedan localities.\nHe visited shops along with a team of officials from the Food Department. He checked the prices of sugar and found that they were much higher than the government-set rates.\nThe shopkeepers were warned that they would face further action if they continued to sell sugar at exorbitant prices.\nThe Assistant Commissioner’s action is a welcome step in the fight against profiteering. It is hoped that this will send a strong message to other shopkeepers and deter them from selling essential commodities at inflated prices.",
