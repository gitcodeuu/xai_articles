  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 14 (APP): Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar on Thursday resolved that the government would defend every inch of Pakistan’s land and protect every Pakistani citizen, both on western and eastern borders.\n“We will defend every inch of our land and will try to protect every soul who we consider to be a Pakistani. We have no doubt or fear to express this position… No one should have any misunderstanding,” the prime minister said in an interview with a private television channel.\nHe said through his letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP), President Arif Alvi just gave a suggestion, not a decision, on the general elections, and until a court verdict, his letter had no legal binding.\nHe said the caretaker government was there to assist the process of holding elections in a transparent way.\nAbout the controversy on powers for deciding the election date, the prime minister said the parliament had passed a law that was also assented to by the president.\nHe said as there was no judicial conclusion as yet, the government was bound by the prevailing law. However, it would adhere to any court verdict on the subject.\nComing to a sub judice matter of NAB law amendments, the prime minister said the parliament had an inherent right for legislation. He said while interpreting the law and constitution, the judiciary should also strike a balance to avoid any interference in other institutions’ domains.\nCalling the terrorism and economic challenge the existential threats for Pakistan, Prime Minister Kakar said that in the next polls, he would vote for a political party with an agenda for economic revival.\nTo a question about the duration of the caretaker setup, he said he could not give any definite timeframe, however, any timeline would be within the ambit of the law.\nExpressing his trust in the whole ECP, the prime minister said being a mandated body, the Commission would come up with a definite timeline for the elections.\nTo a question, he said the imprisoned Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief should be given the facilities that he was entitled to as a former prime minister.\nAsked whether the proposal for banning the PTI was put forth before his cabinet, he said the government would decide as per merit.\nDiscussing the May 9 incident, he said on that day, the political workers tried to create unrest.\nHe said the PTI chief could not analyze the factors of his ouster from the government on realistic grounds and that due to the very reason, he had not got any political mileage in the long run.\nComing to the power sector, the prime minister said within 48 hours of its formation, the caretaker government made an intervention and also formed a steering committee under the finance minister.\nHe said the administrative response had already been initiated by taking the provincial governments on board.\nAsked about the sustainability of the ongoing operation against power theft and smuggling, the prime minister said the appropriate application of force needed to be done consistently.\nHe said the process had started for the first time to curb illicit trade and it would continue as now an institutional mechanism was in place.\nHe told the interviewer that the process for privatisation of PIA was underway and a committee had also been formed under the privatisation minister.\nRegarding the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, he said the dates would be decided mutually as Pakistan desired it to be of a prolonged duration.\nTo a question about the ECP’s letter on political appointments in the caretaker setup, the prime minister said the government would try not to appoint a person who was an office-bearer of any political party.\nHe said the ECP had not expressed any dissatisfaction rather made an advice, which the government received with respect.\nAsked about the whereabouts of missing journalist Imran Riaz, Prime Minister Kakar said he did not have any specific information in that regard. He had issued instructions to the law enforcement agencies and would be in a position to share information after receiving reports from them.",
