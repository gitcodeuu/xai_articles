As his forefathers, he always advocated for peaceful, progressive, prosperous, democratic Pakistan,” the speaker remarked.\nHe stressed that election was a key to ensuring the continuity of the democratic process in the country.\n“The Constitution lays clear guidelines regarding elections and it is incumbent upon every institution to follow them in letter and spirit.”\n“As the primary and supreme representative body of the general populace, Parliament must be in charge in a democratic system,” he noted.\nHe reiterated that Pakistan had always upheld democratic principles while dealing with other nations and expects others to follow suit.\n“It is unfortunate that India, the so-called biggest democracy of the world, has been usurping the democratic right of self-determination of people in Indian illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir,” the speaker regretted.\nHe said that the world must take cognizance of the plight of Kashmiris and must raise their voices to stop Indian aggression and tyranny.\nIt is pertinent to mention that the National Assembly of Pakistan has been forefront of launching programs for the inclusion of youth in the democratic system. It was the first parliament which opened doors for children, women, minorities, youth, transgender, and other marginalized segment of the populace on the occasion of the Golden Jubilee celebration of the Constitution.\nFirst-ever summer internship for young children, the establishment of the first-ever Parliamentary caucus on Child Rights, the first-ever session of the children’s Parliament and Internship programs for university students have been undertaken in the National Assembly of Pakistan.\nFurthermore, the inauguration of a constitutional monument, Bagh-e-Dastoor, postal stamps, display of original script of the constitution book exhibitions, and launching of Constitutional App was also undertaken for the inclusion of youth in the democratic and parliamentary process.",
