We condemn that people are being brutalized and killed. In fact, the hospital in Gaza was bombed and more than 500 people died. All this creates more bitterness”, the president stated.\nPresident Alvi underscored that war totally destroyed any possibility of peace, adding that walls were being raised to stop the Palestinian people from trying to achieve a peaceful two-state solution.\nHe said that such walls would not withstand and would be breached by the people.\n“As long as a two-state solution is being suppressed, people will react”, he maintained.\nThe Palestinian ambassador thanked the President of Pakistan for visiting the Embassy of Palestine during such difficult times.\nHe termed Israel’s actions in Gaza as a genocide of the Palestinian people.\nEarlier, the president also recorded his remarks in the condolence book in the Palestinian Embassy and expressed his deep condolences with the people of Palestine and the families of the martyrs, who lost their lives in the barbaric Israeli attacks.",
