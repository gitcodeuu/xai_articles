Referring to the speech of President Xi Jinping at the Belt & Road Forum, he said ‘BRI is a new platform for international economic cooperation’ terming the BRI as the ‘most significant development and diplomatic initiative in the 21st Century’.\nHe said the core of the BRI and, indeed, Pakistan-China relations, is the people-to-people connectivity, especially the role of media, think tanks, academia, youth and NGOs to build a more ‘open, inclusive and interconnected world’.\nQuoting Chairman Mao that ‘an idea becomes a material force when it is grasped by millions and millions of people’, added Senator Mushahid, that ‘BRI is today a material force in the world’, bringing benefits and opportunities globally.\nReferring to the international situation, Senator Mushahid Hussain said in the Middle East, ‘we are witnessing a genocide in Gaza, where the West is complicit in Israeli crimes as they are supporting Israel’ and all their talk of human rights and democracy is ‘hypocritical based on double standards’.\nHe termed the Gaza situation as a ‘struggle between the oppressed and oppressors’ and ‘we are with the oppressed & heroic Palestinians’.\nHe termed the BRI as the way forward based on connectivity and cooperation and said ‘CPEC is guarantor for a better tomorrow for Pakistan and people of Pakistan, taking ownership of CPEC, will take CPEC forward towards successful conclusion’. Finally, Senator Mushahid Hussain termed fake news, falsehoods and fiction as the ‘biggest challenge to BRI’ since Information Warfare was being waged against BRI. He urged a collective and cooperative approach of BRI countries on the media front as a ‘collective voice’ will be a force multiplier. Vice Ministers for International Communication from the Publicity and International Departments of the Communist Party of China were present at the ceremony, which was hosted by ‘People’s Daily’ at its headquarters and President and Editor-in-Chief of People’s Daily, the party organs of CPC, were present alongside 200 journalists from over 60 countries.",
