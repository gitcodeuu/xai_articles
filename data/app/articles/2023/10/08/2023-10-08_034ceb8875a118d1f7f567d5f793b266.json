Marginalized communities already stigmatized can leverage these spaces to uplift themselves socially and economically”, he added.\nTherefore, it is necessary to realize that online spaces and by extension internet needs to be integrated with rights perspective.\nHe said that an approach developed by UNESCO that safeguards rights, is open and accessible for all and consists of pluralism.\nThe 74th UN General Assembly proclaimed 28 September as the International Day for Universal Access to Information (IDUAI).
