Our expedition for resilience is consistent and we need to make our utmost efforts to realize the ideals.\nThe Disaster Management System in Pakistan is currently undergoing a transformation, shifting from a reactive to a proactive approach.\nThis represents a significant change in how we collectively address unexpected crises. In the past, the primary focus was on responding to emergencies after they had already occurred, often resulting in substantial loss of life and property.\nHowever, due to advancements in technology and a deeper understanding of natural disasters, Pakistan is now moving towards taking proactive measures.\nThis transformation involves the establishment of a modern National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) at the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).\nThe disaster NEOC is now capacitated to create a common operating picture enabled by multiple satellite feeds, software, and Artificial intelligence tools that are expected to strengthen digital risk assessment, early warning systems, and preparedness strategies.\nNational Resilience Day prompts us to embrace best practices and implement policies and strategies aimed at fortifying our nation’s resilience.\nOur policy initiatives should encompass various sectors, including the resilient and safe development of infrastructure, improved disaster preparedness, poverty alleviation, safer spatial land use planning, adherence to building codes, efficient water resource management, sound agricultural practices, and increased afforestation nationwide, including coastal areas.\nGiven our vulnerabilities, I urge all federal and provincial stakeholders to collaborate closely to reduce disaster risks, enhance preparedness, and establish swift response mechanisms through usage of latest technological tools. It is of utmost important that we prioritize the welfare of vulnerable segments of our society, including women, children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities in all our endeavors.\nOn this occasion, I express our gratitude for the invaluable support and assistance provided by the international community, civil society, and private philanthropy in bolstering our national response efforts during the recent mega flood disaster. I also call upon the international community to extend their utmost support to Pakistan in mitigating the adverse impacts of the climate change phenomenon that it disproportionately affects.\nWe have, as a nation, witnessed the relentless force of nature through earthquakes, floods, cyclones, and other calamities. These events have tested our resolve, but they have also illuminated the remarkable spirit of unity, compassion, and resilience that defines us as a people.\nI firmly believe that, as we have done in the past, the people of Pakistan will continue to show their generosity by assisting their fellow citizens struck by disasters through their contributions and tireless efforts.\nMay Allah guide and help us in building a strong and resilient Pakistan.",
