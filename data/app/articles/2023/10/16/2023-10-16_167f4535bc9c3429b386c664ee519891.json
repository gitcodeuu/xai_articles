  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 16 (APP): The Italian Embassy in Pakistan on Monday organized an immersive digital art exhibition, bringing an innovative art form to the Pakistani audience.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Italian Ambassador Andreas Ferrarese expressed his pride in presenting the unique showcase of digital art to the public, highlighting its versatility and wide range of possibilities.\nThe ambassador acknowledged the artwork of Stefano Fake, one of Italy’s celebrated digital artists. He praised Italy’s capacity to blend historical heritage with new and creative arts, dispelling the notion that the country was solely associated with its past.\nStefano Fake, in his address, delved into the journey of digital art, which he began nearly 30 years ago.\nHe described his transition from traditional art to digital tools in 1997, culminating in the establishment of his studio in 2001, dedicated to creating immersive art experiences.\nFake underlined that every era had its unique artistic tools, and digital art represented the current period’s creative expression.\nHe said, “The purpose of art is, after all, to create original and imaginative forms of aesthetic expression shared with a community through experiences and events.”\nStefano Fake’s early work in this field was initially met with skepticism, often being associated with music or youth-centric events. However, over time, digital art gained recognition and acceptance. His exhibitions now span the globe, from Germany to Colombia, and even recent showcases in Berlin and Shanghai. This transformation reflects the growing appreciation for new media art worldwide.\nOne of Kake’s groundbreaking approaches was to immerse audiences in a digital environment, using video projection to transform spaces and even people.\nHe dispelled early concerns about safety and emphasized the combination of physical reality with digital art, creating immersive experiences that evolve and transcend traditional static forms of art.\nThe term “immersive art experiences” emerged, capturing the essence of their work, as it blends physical spaces, bodies, and digital artworks, making it a unique and ephemeral experience. These art experiences offer a fresh perspective, bridging the gap between contemporary culture and art.",
