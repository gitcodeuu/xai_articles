The two principals also exchanged perspectives on the situation in Afghanistan and the tragedy unfolding in Palestine.\nThey underscored the need for the world community’s urgent intervention to stop unabated oppression against Palestinian civilian population and provide immediate relief assistance. The proactive role of the UN and OIC in ensuring urgent action to address the current unacceptable situation was emphasised.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood and Dr. Shaykh al-Islami also underscored the value attached to the institutional relationship between ISSI and IPIS and reaffirmed their commitment to intensify mutual exchanges and expand the scope of mutual collaboration between the two think-tanks.\nDuring the first working session, speakers highlighted recent progress in the Pakistan-Iran bilateral relationship, including bilateral trade surpassing $2 billion, despite the challenge of sanctions.

A wide array of potential areas for regional collaboration was deliberated upon and the presenters called for concrete actions, self-sufficiency, and the political resolve to harness the region’s considerable potential for substantial collaboration through relevant regional multilateral platforms.\nDuring the third working session, the speakers pointed out that Afghanistan plays a pivotal role as a junction connecting Pakistan, Iran, and the Central Asian Republics, rendering it a potential foundation for mutually beneficial regional cooperation. It was also underscored that despite ongoing bilateral engagements, the absence of a coherent regional framework for addressing Afghanistan-related issues highlights the necessity for comprehensive a regional initiative. The imperative of sustained engagement was emphasized, as the continued reliance on bilateral engagement may become the prevailing norm without a transition towards a regional mechanism.\nAmbassador Khalid Mahmood, Chairman BoG ISSI, made concluding remarks highlighting the fruitful exchanges during the working sessions and the important contribution that the ISSI-IPIS Dialogue makes to overall bilateral cooperation.",
