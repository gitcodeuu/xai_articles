He had prayed the accountability court to delay the judgment but his request was not accepted.\nHe returned back to the country face the jail and filed appeals against the judgment, Nawaz Sharif added.\nHe stated that the court had already acquitted co-accused Maryam Nawaz and her husband Capt. (retd) Muhammad Safdar Awan in the Avenfield property case but his (Nawaz’s) appeal was dismissed due to absence.\nThe court had stated in its order that he could file the appeal again when he surrendered or was arrested, he added.\nNawaz further said that the joint investigation team (JIT) in the Panama Papers case could not provide any proof of corruption or receiving kickbacks against him.\nHe said that he could not appear before the court due to medical reasons, and his medical report had been submitted to Lahore High Court (LHC).\nHe added that he had not misused his bail.\nNawaz said that he would reach Islamabad at 1 a.m. on October 21, and prayed the court to grant protective bail as he wanted to surrender before it.\nDuring the course of hearing, the petitioner’s lawyer Amjad Pervaiz Advocate gave the references of judgments of top court and said that the courts used to give an opportunity to accused if they wanted to surrender themselves before them.\nThere were many cases in the past where absconders were given an opportunity to surrender, he added.\nNAB Prosecutor Afzal Qureshi said that they had no any objection if any accused wanted to surrender.\nThe court, however, served notices to NAB and sought arguments on Thursday.\nThe accountability court had awarded 10-year jail term to Nawaz Sharif along with 8 million pounds fine in the Avenfield property case and seven-year imprisonment sentence in the Al-Azia Steel Mills reference. The court had also disqualified the former prime minister for ten years for holding any public office.\nAn IHC bench had dismissed his appeals against the accountability court verdicts in June 2021 due to non-appearance.",
