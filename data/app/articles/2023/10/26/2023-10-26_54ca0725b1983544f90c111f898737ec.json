Representatives of countries from all continents of the world were being invited to the summit, he added.\nDr Nadeem Jan said that the importance of health diplomacy in this day and age could not be over emphasized.\n“I believe that diseases have no borders nor do viruses discriminate between races and nationalities hence the need to forge a unified stand against them.”\nThe minister said, “We look forward to strengthen the government-to-government cooperation with the United States and firmly believe in productive partnership for the benefit of our people.”\nHe said that health was the best interface between public and state hence contributing immensely to strengthening the bond between the society and the state.\nThe minister shared that Universal Health Coverage was close to his heart and he had taken the initiative to revamp primary health-care system which would reduce the burden on secondary and tertiary care facilities.\n“We are currently revamping 430 Basic Health Units with the support of WHO (World Health Organisation) in the first phase.”\nDr Nadeem Jan said that an initiative was underway to digitalise the whole health system.\nBoth sides discussed at length the cooperation in fighting malnutrition in Pakistan.\nDr Nadeem Jan said, “We will like to pool resources and conduct mapping exercise to determine the area and community most in need and allocate resources accordingly.”\nThe US ambassador showed keen interest in the area and affirmed commitment to the cause emphasizing a targeted approach to malnutrition.\nIt was agreed that the technical group would further discuss collaboration in that regard between the two sides.\n“Pakistan continues to fight the last remnants of polio with strengthened resolve.
