  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 26 (APP): Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Isa on Thursday observed that women were being deprived of their rights in an unconstitutional and un-Islamic manner.\nThe CJP was heading a three-member bench which heard the case pertaining to a land dispute.\nThe court ordered the Revenue Department of Dera Ghazi Khan to immediately hand over possession of her share of inherited land to woman Sara Akhtar after after taking it from her maternal uncle Sardar Mansoor.\nThe court also directed the maternal uncle to pay all the expenditure his niece had incurred on litigation.\nDuring the course of hearing, the CJP remarked that the court was not giving special concession to women.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer said that the woman had sold her land in 1989 to her maternal uncle Sardar Mansoor, and reclaimed its ownership after 20 years and denied her own signature on the sale deed.\nJustice Athar Minallah observed that it was the responsibility of the buyer to prove the purchase of the land. Three courts had ruled against the petitioner, he noted.\nSara Akhtar’s lawyer said that his client was a minor at the time of the alleged sale of the land. Sardar Mansoor is the former chairman of district council who had transferred the land to his young children, wife, mother-in-law and brother-in-law, he added.",
