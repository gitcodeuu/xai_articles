The first election was held in December 1970, he added.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan had announced the date for elections in the last week of January, he said while ruling out any problem in holding the election vis-à-vis weather conditions.\n“After the completion of delimitation, political parties will be given 54 days for the electoral campaign,” he responded to a query.\nSolangi said the caretaker government was taking effective measures to address economic issues.
