  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 15 (APP): Chairman Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) Dr. Qibla Ayaz and its members strongly condemned Israel’s expansionist policies, as they were using the recent conflict to further their reprehensible colonial objectives.\nHe, in a statement, said last week’s attacks on Gaza by Israel had blatantly violated international laws, targeting civilian populations, including children, elderly and women.\nDr. Qibla emphasized that the Pakistani people stood in solidarity with the Palestinian resistance movement, and the founding father of Pakistan, Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s policy regarding Palestine was still considered relevant by the Pakistani people.\nHe said that it was imperative for the world to understand that Israel had been occupying Palestine aggressively for nearly 75 years, depriving Palestinians of their rights and disregarding international laws and United Nations resolutions.\nHe said that the council asserted that a viable solution to this issue was impossible without the establishment of an independent Palestinian state.\nHe called for an emergency meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) to initiate effective diplomatic actions.\nThese actions should not only prevent aggression by Israel but also make earnest efforts to establish an independent Palestinian state, with Al-Quds as its capital, based on clear and just policies, he maintained.",
