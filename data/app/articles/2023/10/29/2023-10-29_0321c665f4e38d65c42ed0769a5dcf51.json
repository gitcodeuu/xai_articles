  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 29 (APP): A significant number of Tehreek-e-Bedari-e-Ummat-e-Mustafa workers on Sunday participated in the Gaza March in the federal capital.\nThe Gaza March, a demonstration organized by Jammat-e-Islami, was marked by expressions of solidarity with the Palestinian people and a call for Muslim unity in the face of the ongoing crisis in Palestine particularly in the Gaza Strip.\nHead of Tehreek-e-Bedari-e-Ummat-e-Mustafa, Allama Syed Jawad Naqvi, addressing the gathering, brought attention to the persistent crisis in Palestine. He attributed this crisis to the absence of Taqwa, or piety and consciousness of God, among Muslim communities worldwide.\nIn his speech, Naqvi emphasized the pressing need for practical steps to resolve the Palestinian issue permanently. He passionately urged believers to mobilize and organize rallies against the ongoing Israeli atrocities in Palestine and specifically in Gaza, across the world.\nNaqvi underscored the importance of active resistance, public awareness, and support for the Palestinian cause.\nHe said it would serve as a platform to advocate for a united Muslim response to the challenges faced by the Palestinian population.",
