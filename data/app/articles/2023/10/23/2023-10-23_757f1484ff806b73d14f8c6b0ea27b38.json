Over the next few weeks, Vice Chancellors will activate planning teams on their campuses to complete strategic planning.\nSpeaking at the event, USAID’s Deputy Mission Director Maura O’Brien said, “What makes the Higher Education System Strengthening Activity uniquely powerful is that it brings together both Pakistani and American universities to learn from each other, exchange ideas, and think strategically to solve shared challenges.”\nDr. Aslam Chaudhry, Chief of Party and Research Professor at University of Utah, appreciated USAID’s partnership with the Pakistani government on higher education.
