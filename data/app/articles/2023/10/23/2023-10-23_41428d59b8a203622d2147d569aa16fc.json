He criticized the deafening silence in response to the tragic killing of children in Gaza.\nHe emphasized that the Palestine issue was fundamentally a struggle between the oppressor and the oppressed, underlining its significance for all of humanity.\nAshrafi urged the United States, Great Britain, and European nations not to jeopardize global peace for the sake of their affiliation with Israel, warning that if the flames in Gaza were not extinguished, they could spread worldwide.\nHe further contended that anti-Islamic and anti-Muslim entities were trying to exploit the situation in Gaza to incite chaos in the Muslim nations.\nHe also called upon the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, a central point of unity for Muslims, to lead Islamic nations in taking practical steps to resolve the Palestine issue.",
