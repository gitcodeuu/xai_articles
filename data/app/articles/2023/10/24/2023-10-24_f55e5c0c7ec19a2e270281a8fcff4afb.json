  "content": "MIRPUR ( AJK): Oct 24 (APP) :: The Jammu and Kashmir National Front (JKNF) has urged Kashmiris to observe October 27 as a black day, marking the beginning of the Indian occupation of the territory.\nIn a statement, JKNF spokesman Shafiq ur Rehman said that India’s invasion of Kashmir was the most atrocious incident that threw the region into throes of instability and perpetual violence.\nHe said that India’s attempt to legalize its illegal occupation rests on a bogus instrument of accession signed by the Maharaja.\nRehman said that India’s perpetual denial to grant the right of self-determination to the people of Kashmir has brought death and destruction in the region.\nHe said that Kashmiris are being brutally victimized by Indian military and paramilitary personnel, and that more than 100,000 Kashmiris have been killed because of India’s occupation.\nRehman urged the Indian government to shun its policy of intransigence and start a dialogue to seek a just and lasting settlement of the Kashmir dispute.\nHe reiterated the Kashmiris’ pledge to take the ongoing struggle to its logical conclusion and achieve their cherished goal of freedom.\nThe statement comes as tensions between India and Pakistan over Kashmir remain high.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
