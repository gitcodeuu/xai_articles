  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): The Supreme Court on Tuesday sought comments from Pakistan and Punjab bar councils regarding teaching of petitions’ drafting in law colleges.\nThe court sought the comments from the bar councils after it noted flaws in the drafting of a petition during hearing of a case pertaining to a conflict of land distribution. It, however, noted that the bar councils had no connection with the case.\nExpressing his displeasure over mistakes in the petition, Chief Justice of Pakistan Qazi Faez Esa observed that when the lawyers of Punjab would learn to write a writ petition. Should all the law colleges of Punjab be closed, he asked.\nHe remarked that the purpose of hiring a lawyer was that he would draft a writ petition, and submit it after its vetting.\nHe said most of the conflicts and strikes pertained to the lawyers of Punjab. How the lawyers had the right to observe strikes, he asked.\nLawyer Chaudhry Afrasiab adopted the stance that he had not prepared the petition himself.\nThe court ordered to fix the case again after six weeks.",
