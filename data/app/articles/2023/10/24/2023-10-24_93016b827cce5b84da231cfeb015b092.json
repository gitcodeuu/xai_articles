  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): The Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI), in collaboration with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea (ROK), is holding a Seminar on “40 Years of Friendship- Past, Present and Future between Republic of Korea and Pakistan”, on Wednesday.\nPakistan and the Republic of Korea have forged a strong partnership, marked by strategic cooperation, economic collaboration, and cultural exchanges, a news release said.\nThe two nations have witnessed a steady expansion in bilateral relations, with a focus on mutual development and peace in the region. South Korea’s robust investment in Pakistan, particularly in infrastructure, technology, and manufacturing sectors, has greatly contributed to Pakistan’s economic growth and modernization. Bilateral cooperation extends beyond economics, as both countries have engaged in educational and cultural initiatives, strengthening the ties between the two peoples. As South Korea’s “New Southern Policy” and Pakistan’s “Engage East” strategy converge, this partnership is set to become even more pivotal, not only for the countries involved but also for the broader Asia-Pacific region.\nThe Pakistan-ROK relationship, founded on shared values and aspirations, exemplifies the potential of international collaboration. Pakistan views South Korea as a valuable ally in its quest for economic development and technological advancements, while South Korea recognizes Pakistan as a strategic partner in the region. The two nations have demonstrated their commitment to global peace and security by cooperating closely in various international fora, including the United Nations. As both countries continue to work together, they not only elevate their own positions on the global stage but also contribute to the stability and prosperity of Asia. The Pakistan-Korea partnership stands as a testament to the power of diplomacy, trade, and cultural exchanges in forging stronger ties between nations across the globe.\nWithin this backdrop, the ISSI in collaboration with the Embassy of the Republic of Korea, is organizing a seminar to mark the 40-year journey of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Korea and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. This event brings together distinguished diplomats, academics and practitioners from both countries who will share their accounts on the historical journey of diplomatic relations between the Republic of Korea and Pakistan and discuss ways and means to further strengthen this relationship and diversify their cooperation.\nThe Seminar will highlight key success stories, showcasing the immense progress made in areas such as trade, investment, technology, education, and cultural exchanges. The opening ceremony will feature a keynote address by Mr. Muhammad Ali, Federal Minister of Energy, Power & Petroleum and it will include welcome remarks by Ambassador Park Kijun, Ambassador of the Republic of Korea, and welcome remarks by Ambassador Sohail Mahmood, DG ISSI.
