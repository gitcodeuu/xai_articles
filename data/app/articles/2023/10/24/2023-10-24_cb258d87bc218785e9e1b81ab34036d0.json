He had travelled abroad for medical treatment with the consent of the court and his medical reports had been submitted regularly.\nAddressing the lawyer, the chief justice observed that they would have to issue a notice to NAB to hear its point opf view. The revival of appeals was not a routine matter and he had to satisfy the court as why the petitioner did not appear before the court, he added.\nAzam Nazir Tarar requested for extension of protective bail for few days, saying it was a case of first impression. The accountability court had changed the petitioner’s status of absconder. Nawaz Sharif had faced a lot of hardships during the time as his wife and mother also died, he added.\nThe chief justice questioned whether the Bureau wanted to arrest Nawaz Sharif and whether it had any objection on the extension of his protective bail. The NAB prosecutor replied that his department had no objection in that regard.\nThe chief justice said that NAB could withdraw its references against the petitioner if it considered the same were filed wrongly. Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb asked the NAB Prosecutor General to inform the court after taking instructions from the NAB Chairman.\nThe bench served notices to NAB and adjourned further hearing of the case.",
