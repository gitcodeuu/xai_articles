He stressed that Africa is the future of global commerce and encouraged Pakistani businessmen to align themselves with these lucrative opportunities.\nEthiopia, he pointed out, serves as a gateway to Africa, making it easier for businesses to trade across the continent. He highlighted Ethiopia’s remarkable status as the fastest-growing economy, producing over 97 percent of clean, green, and sustainable energy from hydro, geothermal, and other renewable sources, making it an investment haven for global entrepreneurs.\nThe Ambassador assured Pakistani investors of the Ethiopian government’s full support, inviting them to establish dedicated economic zones in the country. He lauded the proactive efforts of the Pakistani business community, citing a significant visit made earlier this year by over 75 Pakistani businessmen, including representatives from ICCI.
