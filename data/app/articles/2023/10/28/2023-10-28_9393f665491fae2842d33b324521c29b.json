They added that India’s continued brutal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and its war-mongering policies are affecting south Asian peace and stability.\nThe political experts and analysts pointed out that peace of South Asia remains at peril due to India’s belligerence against its neighbors.\nThey said Pakistan has time and again informed the world about India’s destabilizing activities in South Asia, adding that the international community must take notice of Indian role as a spoiler of peace in the region.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
