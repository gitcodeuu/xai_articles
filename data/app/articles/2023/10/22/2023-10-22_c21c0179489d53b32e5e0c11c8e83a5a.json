To sustain the industry-academia collaboration a Research for Innovation portal is also launched.\nHEDP has recently completed the establishment of Quality Enhancement Cells in Affiliated Colleges (QECACs) in 29 universities across Pakistan.\nIn addition, the revised Undergraduate Education Policy (UEP) is finalized and is being rolled out to HEIs across Pakistan.\nThe faculty of Affiliated Colleges (ACs) of KP, as well as Punjab, has already been trained on new UEP implementation while the plan for other provinces/regions including Sindh and Baluchistan will be rolled out very soon.\nThe IT component head briefed members on the expansion of the Pakistan Education Research Network (PERN) to ACs, and other initiatives like the Student Life Cycle system, Enterprise Resource Management and allied computing and storage capacities for HEIs, which are under various stages of procurement.\nThe project also supported NAHE in conducting a women’s leadership program held in Sindh and Baluchistan to develop future women leaders for Higher Education.\nThe committee members appreciated the efforts of the HEDP team and provided valuable suggestions.\nThe lack of public funding for the Higher Education sector of Pakistan was discussed and allied mitigation strategies for revenue generation models and financial autonomy were proposed accordingly.\nMembers were briefed that under Component 6, overall more than 100 HEIs were given substantial financial support focusing on their IT readiness and making them self-sustainable. This is in addition to the public grant funding from the HEC regular stream for public sector universities.\nThe members also explained the grim situation of HEIs especially Affiliated Colleges (ACs), in their respective regions. They also suggested increasing project activities based on regional needs and improving coordination between HEDP and provincial departments.\nMembers appreciated the project efforts and suggested the continuation of such project initiatives.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
