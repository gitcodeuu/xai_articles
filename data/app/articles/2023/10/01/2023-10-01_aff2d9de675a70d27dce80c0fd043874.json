The economic significance of coffee extends to millions of farmers and laborers who rely on coffee cultivation for their livelihoods.\nHowever, coffee production has often been associated with labor-intensive and challenging working conditions, highlighting the urgency of promoting safe and healthy workplaces within the industry.\nCoffee is more than just a source of energy and pleasure; it offers several health benefits when consumed in moderation.\nAccording to a study, coffee can boost mental alertness, provide antioxidants, reduce the risk of certain diseases including Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s, and type 2 diabetes and enhance physical performance.",
