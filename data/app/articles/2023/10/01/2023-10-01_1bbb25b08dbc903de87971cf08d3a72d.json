Media policy introduced in May 2020 is meant to further muzzle press in the territory, it deplored.\nIt said India, under Modi, continues to slide down the World Press Freedom Index and since Modi became PM in 2014, India has slipped in rank from 140 to 150 in the World Press Freedom Index of 180 countries.\nThe report said Modi’s India is responsible for ordering the highest number of network shutdowns in the world, adding most of the mainstream media outlets in India have been corrupted by BJP and are run by Indian agencies.\nIt said many mainstream media organizations in India are owned by BJP and RSS business tycoons who work for Hindutva policies. The Modi regime is also targeting free press to hide its crimes against religious minorities from the world, it deplored.\nThe report said the international community must put pressure on the Modi regime to stop expanding its control over the media through the use of draconian laws.",
