He urged the European Union, the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, all Islamic countries and the International Court of Justice to intervene and stop the Israeli carnage in the Gaza Strip.\nHe said the entire Muslim Ummah should play its role in stopping the Israeli massacre as children, mothers, sisters and daughters of Palestine and particularly Gaza were calling us for help at this trying time. He termed the ongoing Israeli attacks on Gaza Strip as the worst and open terrorism, adding that the number of martyred Palestinians had exceeded 10,000 so far.\nAzad alleged that Qadianis were enemies of Islam and Pakistan because they had opposed the handing over of Bait-ul-Muqadis to Muslims.
