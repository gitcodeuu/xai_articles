  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 27 (APP): Special Assistant to Prime Minister for Human Rights and Women Empowerment Mushaal Hussein Mullick on Friday called upon the global community to give up its silence on Indian state terrorism and brutalities unleashed on people of the war-battered and besieged Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and take practical steps to ensure resolution of the lingering Kashmir dispute as per the UNSC resolutions.\nIn her video message on the Black Day , Mushaal said that on October 27, 1947, Indian troops had invaded Jammu and Kashmir and occupied it in total violation of the partition plan of the subcontinent and against the Kashmiris’ aspirations.\nSince then, she added that Indian brutal forces had been engaged in the genocide and massacre of the Kashmiri .\nThis Day, she added that Kashmiris on both sides of the line of control and across the world marked October 27 as Black Day today to convey a strong message to the world that Kashmiris rejected illegal occupation of their motherland by terrorist Indian state and would not rest till they achieved their cherished goal of freedom from it, Mushaal added.",
