First under the Dogra Raj and now under India’s illegal occupation, IIOJK was facing atrocities being perpetrated by the occupying forces.\nShe said the Indian government aimed to ‘Hinduize’ Kashmir, which placed heavy responsibility on the international community to raise its voice against such illegal actions. She proposed highlighting the Kashmir cause within three frameworks: UN Genocide Convention, structural violence, and right of self-determination.\nAdvocate Imran Shafiq drew parallel between India’s illegal actions and violation of international law by Indian forces.\nHe called upon the international community to ensure implementation of the UNSC resolutions providing for as plebiscite, and particularly Resolution 122 of 1957 that nullified any action taken by the so-called constituent assembly in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and forbade any demographic change.\nAndrabi extensively discussed about the historical dynamics of ‘instrument of accession.’\nHe addressed how India had maliciously indulged in Jammu and Kashmir at the time of the partition and had contacted all the stakeholders who were experienced in forcefully controlling the princely states.\nAcknowledging the historical struggle of Kashmiris, Saghar highlighted the most-neglected Jammu Massacre in 1947 in which 250,000 Muslims were killed by Dogra Raj. He stressed the importance of forceful advocacy of the Kashmir cause, with the fullest backing of the entire political spectrum.\nNizami also shed light on the human rights, international law, and peace and security aspect of the Kashmir dispute.\nHe stated that while the UN affirmed self-determination of Kashmiris, there was an imperative need to implement UNSC resolutions.\nHe noted Pakistan’s continuous efforts to advocate the rights of the Kashmiris and added that peace in the region must be the topmost priority for all.\nHe suggested that Pakistan should work along with the UN to pressure India to release all political prisoners, repeal all draconian laws, allow the safe access of international organizations to the Valley, and implement the UN Security Council resolutions.\nAmbassador (retd) Khalid Mahmood made concluding remarks, affirming Pakistan’s all-out support to the Kashmiris until the dispute is justly resolved.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
