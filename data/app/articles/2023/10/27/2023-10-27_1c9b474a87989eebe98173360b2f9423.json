He highlighted the shared interest of both countries in ensuring a peaceful and prosperous South Asia, and their cooperation in various multilateral forums.\nThe Joint Secretary also stressed the broad spectrum of cooperation between Pakistan and Korea, encompassing areas such as cultural heritage. He mentioned that Buddhism, with its diverse tapestry of traditions and life teachings, was introduced to the ancient Baekje Kingdom in Korea from present-day Pakistan by Monk Maranantha nearly 1,500 years ago.\nThe Ambassador Park Kijun, in his speech, highlighted the vast potential for mutually beneficial collaboration in diverse fields. He said that the special exhibition promises to bring the cultural heritage of Pakistan and Korea together.\nThe exhibition features a diverse range of photographs, capturing the rich cultural heritage of both Pakistan and Korea. Some of the notable photographs include:\nA panoramic view of the ancient city of Taxila in Pakistan, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. A close-up of a Buddha statue from the Gandhara region of Pakistan, dating back to the 2nd century AD.\nA photograph of the Bulguksa Temple in Korea, another UNESCO World Heritage Site. A photograph of the Seokguram Grotto in Korea, home to a magnificent 7th-century Buddha statue.\nThe exhibition also features photographs of the ongoing conservation and restoration work at important Buddhist sites in both countries. For example, one photograph shows archaeologists working at the site of the ancient city of Mohenjo-daro in Pakistan, while another photograph shows conservators restoring a Buddhist mural at the Donggung Palace and Wolji Pond in Korea.\nThe photographic exhibition “40 Years of Diplomatic Relations between the Republic of Korea and Pakistan” is a timely and important celebration of the deep cultural ties between the two countries.
