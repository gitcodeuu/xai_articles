On October 27, 1947, India illegally occupied Kashmir and established its monopoly, he said and added, from October 27, 1947 till today, Kashmiris have been subjected to the worst state terrorism in seven decades.\n“Kashmiris did not surrender to atrocities but stood firm in front of Indian forces and their sacrifices will not go in vain”, he expressed.\nAli Mardan said that it was a crude illusion of India that it would be able to stop the 74 year long freedom struggle of Kashmiri Mujahideen by calling it terrorism.\nHe added that the moral, diplomatic and political support of the Kashmiri people would continue till the independence of IIOJK.\nThe Balochistan government strongly condemns the violence against Kashmiri people, Ali Mardan said.\n“The peaceful movement of freedom of the oppressed Kashmiris is an eternal struggle for the attainment of human rights which cannot be suppressed under any circumstances”, he added.\nThe chief minister urged the world powers to play their positive role to make this movement of freedom of the Kashmiri people a success.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
