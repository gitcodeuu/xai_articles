The principles of justice, compassion, and peaceful coexistence, which are deeply rooted in Islamic teachings, must guide our path towards a just and lasting solution.”\nHe opined that the Muslim countries must collaborate with other nations to facilitate and mediate peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine. Both the parties should engage in genuine and open-minded dialogue, recognizing the rights of all involved, including the Palestinian right to self-rule, he added.\nIsrar called upon the international community to stand united against the atrocities in Gaza, support the efforts of the OIC, and champion dialogue and diplomacy as the only viable means to achieve a peaceful resolution. The world must ensure the due rights of the people of Gaza and the entire region so that they could experience peace and stability in their lives.",
