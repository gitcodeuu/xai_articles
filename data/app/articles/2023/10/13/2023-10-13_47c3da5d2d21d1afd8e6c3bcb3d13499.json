  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP): The Higher Education Commission (HEC), Pakistan organised on Friday Seeratun Nabi (Peace be Upon Him) Symposium to shed light on the life and teachings of the Last Prophet Hazrat Muhammad (PBUH).\nChairman HEC Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed was the chief guest on the occasion while Guest speakers included Khurshid Ahmad Nadeem, Chairman National Rehmatul-lil-Alamin Authority and Dr. Muhammad Saleem Mazhar, DG, National Language Promotion Department. The symposium was attended by Vice Chancellors, faculty members, students and HEC employees.\nPaying homage to the Holy Prophet (PBUH), Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed said the Sunnah of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) provides us with complete guidance on every aspect of life. He urged the universities and degree-awarding institutions to regularly organise events to highlight the teachings of the Holy Messenger of Allah.\n“It is our prime obligation to tell our children and youth about the importance of Seerah in our life, as it is a must for us, being Muslims, to follow our beloved Prophet (PBUH) in every sphere of life,” he said, adding that the Prophet (PBUH) taught us to be in this world as if we were strangers or travellers and indulge in worldly affairs as much as required.\nKhurshid Ahmad Nadeem appreciated HEC for organising the symposium on a much-needed topic. He particularly addressed the youth in the audience and advised them to study Seerah of the Prophet (PBUH) and understand the purpose of their lives through Prophet’s teachings.\n“Unless you find out why were the Prophets sent by Allah, you will not be able to know the purpose of your life. When you start reading the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), the objective of your own life becomes obvious and it clears all the ambiguities about this life and the hereafter.”\nDr. Muhammad Saleem Mazhar shed light on different aspects of the life of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and emphasised the significance of studying and understanding Seerah.\nHe explained how Muslim scholars like Maulana Rumi and Allama Iqbal have elaborated and made it easy for us to comprehend the actual message to be derived from Quran and Seerah of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\nRenowned Naat Khwan Hina Nasrullah and a few HEC employees recited Naats on the occasion.",
