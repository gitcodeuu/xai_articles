The court directed to also include secretaries of commerce and secretaries of industries in the meeting.\nThe court also summoned member customs policy on the next hearing and sought a progress report regarding the meeting with the association. The court said that it would take a decision if the meeting didn’t be fruitful.\nThe petitioners had adopted the stance that they had been importing the auto parts for years. Usually, the parts were used to be released after receiving duty and fine, they said.\nThey said that if the import of the part was stopped then the repair cost of the vehicle would be increased which would affect the economy.",
