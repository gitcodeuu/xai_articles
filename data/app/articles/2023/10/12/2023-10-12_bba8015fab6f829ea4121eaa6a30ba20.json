They also interacted with the bishops and the local Christian community to get feedback on the restoration of churches.\nThe visit was organized by the government of Pakistan to provide the international media with an opportunity for first-hand information about the restoration of churches.\nThe restoration of churches is part of Pakistan’s commitment to ensure the rights of religious minorities with the liberty to practice their faith in accordance with the country’s constitution.",
