  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 2 (APP): Aspiring voters can confirm their registration status on the voter lists by sending their Computerized National Identity Card (CNIC) number to 8300 as the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) allows eligible citizens to register, transfer, or correct their voting details until October 25th.\nAccording to an ECP official, after sending SMS to 8300, an automated response will be generated, furnishing information such as the name of the electoral area, block code, and serial number.\nEach registered voter has the option to verify their details by visiting the District Election Commissioner’s office in their respective area, where the complete electoral roll is accessible. The addresses and contact information for the DEC’s offices across the four provinces can be found on the Election Commission’s website.\nHe mentioned that voters have the option to download Form-21 (for voter registration or transfer), Form-22 (for raising objections or addressing omissions in voting), and Form-23 (for correcting personal details). These forms can then be submitted to the appropriate offices of Form Registration Officers and Assistant Registration Officers.\nHe mentioned that citizens can obtain information by dialing the ECP helpline at 051-8848888, where they will receive responses from a tele-computerized system.\nIt is important to mention here that the ECP had removed restrictions on voter lists nationwide, enabling eligible individuals to register, transfer or update their voting information until October 25th.\nThe ECP had suspended the electoral rolls on July 20th this year by utilizing clause 39 of the Election Act 2017.\nHe called upon all eligible citizens to verify the accuracy of their voter registration, make necessary modifications, and process any transfers to align their details with their computerized national identity card information by October 25, 2023.",
