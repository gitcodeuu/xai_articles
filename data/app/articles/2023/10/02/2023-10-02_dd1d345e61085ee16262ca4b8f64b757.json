Reiterating his commitment to abide by the oath, the PM said that he would quit if he lost an absolute majority in the assembly.\nTerming the welfare of the people as his government’s sole agenda, he said that safeguarding the constitutional rights of the people of the state was the responsibility of the coalition government.\nVowing to defend the rights of the people, the PM said that he would continue to raise his voice for the legitimate rights of his people at all available forums.\nHe, however, maintained that there was a dire need to realize our duties and responsibilities towards the state. He said that ruling and opposition parties were like two wheels of a chariot, necessary to run democracy.\nThe PM said, “As long as I am in the government, I will do my best to strengthen the system”.The AJK government, he said, would continue to lend its all-out political, moral and diplomatic support to Kashmiri brethren in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.\nThe PM issued directives for constituting a Board of Governors comprising members from lawyers, civil society and medical professionals to manage and run the hospital successfully.",
