He said the Holy Quran, which is the first book on the Seerat of Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him), should serve as a mirror for both individuals and nations. He said the Holy Quran sternly warns those who did not implement its system on Allah Almighty’s land.\nFederal Tax Ombudsman, Dr. Asif Mahmood Jah organized the Seerat Conference themed ‘Solving Contemporary Issues in the Light of the Prophet’s Seerat’ within his department.\nThe conference brought together tax officials and employees for a competition of Naats and speeches on the Seerat.
