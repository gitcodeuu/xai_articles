Pardoning and forbearing are the qualities that can build nations,” he added.\nIn the religion of Islam, he said, consultation and public opinion were given due importance and with regard to the democratic system, the Islamic traditions were marvelous, he opined.\nAbout holding of elections in the country, the president said that the matter was subjudice before the courts that would decide the issue.\nPresident Alvi termed the number of out of school children, mental health, malnutrition and stunting issues as the grave ones which could not be resolved if they continued their political wrangling.\nThe president reiterated that two-state was the only solution to Palestine issue, adding on March 23, 1943 two resolutions were passed, one for Pakistan and other for Palestine. Pakistan pursued a policy over Palestine as pronounced by its founder Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, he maintained.\nFeeling immense grief over a video clip showing a Palestinian child, identifying the bodies of his parents, the president decried it as huge cruelty to the Palestinian people and stressed that no one could accept such inhuman acts.\nThe president said in the Islamic teachings, sanctity was accorded to a human life.\nTo a query, he replied that on September 13, he had sent a letter to the Election Commission of Pakistan for holding of elections in the country and suggestion to consult the superior judiciary over the issue.\nHe said that election law was changed under an amendment and signed by the acting president when he proceeded to Hajj.\nThe president further said that the caretaker law minister and the relevant caretaker provincial ministers were of the opinion that the President had no mandate to give a date for holding of the elections in the country after the amendment.",
