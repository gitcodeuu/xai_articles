He underscored that “this meeting serves as a testament to Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to its policies on Palestine.”\nHe firmly stated that the Pakistani government and its armed forces were fully aligned on the issue of Palestine and categorically condemned any acts of terrorism against the Palestinian population. He emphasized Pakistan’s support for an independent Palestinian state, with its capital in Al-Qudus (Jerusalem).\nHe said General Asim Munir had rightly given the call to the international community to play an active role in compelling Israel to cease its continued atrocities against innocent Palestinian people. He condemned Israeli attacks on the civilian population, particularly on children, women, and hospitals, labelling these actions as war crimes.\nIn a message to the Palestinian people, Ashrafi assured them of Pakistan’s solidarity, stating, “Although we are far away physically, our hearts beat with you.”\nHe expressed optimism that Palestine would soon attain its long-awaited independence, emphasizing that the resilience of the Palestinian people would not be swayed by the current Israeli barbarism.",
