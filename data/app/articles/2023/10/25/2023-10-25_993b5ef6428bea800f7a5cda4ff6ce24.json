  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 25 (APP): Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) Zonal Office Multan, in close collaboration with the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), conducted a successful raid against an illegal internet service provider at Layyah.\nDuring the raid, operational internet setup and allied equipment were confiscated, and two people were apprehended by FIA on the spot. The culprits have been taken into custody for investigation and further inquiry, as per law said a news release.\nThe successful efforts against illegal internet service providers were made possible because of continuous monitoring, commitment, and persistent efforts by the PTA in curbing the menace of illegal internet services, thus curtailing the loss to the national exchequer in terms of tax evasion and misreporting of revenues.\nThe public is cautioned to avail telecom services from only PTA-licensed operators to avoid sudden discontinuation of service. A list of licensed operators is available at: https://pta.gov.pk/en/industry-support/home/list-of-operators",
