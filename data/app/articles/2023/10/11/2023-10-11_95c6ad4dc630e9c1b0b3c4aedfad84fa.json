He informed that PIA was suffering Rs 500 million loss per day.\nMinister for Privatization said that the caretaker government is working on the privatization process which was started by the previous governments adding that no new entity was added to the privatization list.\nHe said that the government committed to protecting employee rights and benefits for those who were working in these entities.\nHe said that the previous experiments of privatization witnessed remarkable success in sectors like telecommunication, finance and banking, and cement sectors and revenue collection also increased by manifold from these sectors.\nThe minister said that the telecom sector had around 197 million subscribers while covering 98 per cent of the country’s total population. “The telecom sector contributes 2.7% to the GDP.”\nHowever, he reaffirmed the caretaker government’s commitment to fulfilling the responsibilities entrusted to it.",
