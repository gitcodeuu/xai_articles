  "content": "PESHAWAR, Jun 12 (APP):Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman on Monday said the next government after the general election would have to cope with major economic challenges which were the result of the worst policies pursued by the last Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) regime.\nThe country’s gross domestic product had reached zero, while all the major projects were terminated during the PTI government, which should be a matter of concern for its voters, Maulana Fazl said while addressing a press conference here at the Mufti Mahmood Secretariat after a two-day meeting of the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl.\nRejecting the impression that the PTI chief would again become prime minister, he said the public would not vote for the party as one “should not be stung twice from the same hole”.\nHe said the JUI-F meeting condemned the May 9 incidents of rioting and vandalism targeting the state institutions, which were a dark chapter in the country’s history and urged the government to bring the culprits to justice with severe punishments.\nHe said it was up to the PTI members to show whether they were loyal to the state of Pakistan or they preferred their own vested interests. Their “foreign connections” raised concern about their commitment to Pakistan, he added.\nHe said corruption in the projects carried out during the PTI government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa such BRT Peshawar, Malam Jabba, and the Billion Tree should be investigated and action be taken against all the responsible.\nMaulana Fazl recalled that the previous PTI government in KP had received Rs 450 billion from the Federal Government, which seemed to have been misappropriated.\nThe promise of providing Rs 100 billion rupees to the erstwhile FATA over ten years was made, but only Rs 86 billion was allocated in the last five years, he added.\nMaulana Fazl said the incumbent government should provide maximum relief to the common people despite the economic challenges.\nThe PDM chief said the JUI-F meeting lauded the foreign policy of the present government, focusing on better bilateral relations with regional and neighbouring countries.\nHe said Chinese investment in different sectors was welcomed, noting that the friendship between Pakistan and China would further strengthen with the completion of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects.\nThe meeting also expressed dismay over the silence of the world community over human rights abused in occupied Jammu & Kashmir and non-implementation of the United Nations resolutions on the issue lingering for decades.\nMaulana Fazl felicitated Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on his election for the third consecutive term.\nResponding a question, Maulana Faz said former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was not allowed to meet his daughter, as he was in jail despite his wife’s death.\nTo another query, he said If a PTI leader wished to join the JUI-F, he would be welcomes, however, their past mistakes would not be forgiven and they would have to face cases.\nHe said the JUI-F’s central leaders were assigned the task of election preparations in all the provinces. The JUI-F would form an alliance with the party that supported the religious agenda.\nThe Maulana said immediate measures were required for rehabilitation in the storm-ravaged areas of Bannu, Lakki Marwat and Karak.",
