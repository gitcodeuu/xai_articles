She said there was lack of intention and individual will among the stakeholders to act against climate change and threats of natural calamities derived by the human activities.The Parliamentary Secretary underlined that in order to curb the menace of plastic pollution and ecosystem degradation it was imperative for the society as a whole to return to the abandoned practices of eco-friendly solutions like reusable cotton bags and other material.She noted that the country after an all-inclusive process had approved its Electric Vehicles Policy but it had no mechanism to manage e-wastage to be produced due to the lithium batteries being used in the charge-based vehicles.\nIn his welcome remarks, Executive Director, CPDI, Mukhtar Ahmed Ali informed about the participants about the Institute and its latest initiative to start dialogue on environment and climate change which was a new concept for it due to its background of governance, democracy, the right to information and economic issues.He demanded that the risk of climate change demanded an extensive effort which was not limited to the government but rather a multi-stakeholder stride to address overlapping issues caused after anthropogenic activities spearheading global warming.Mukhtar Ali added that there was need of global and local level leadership for taking lead role in reducing carbon-intensive consumption footprint.A thought-provoking poem titled “Oh My Children Save Me” in which the planet earth personified as a mother calling her children to protect her from growing environmental degradation putting her existence into perils.Programme Lead-Climate Action, CPDI, Saima Williams briefed the participants on the Institute’s motivation and realization behind opting environment as a special topic for its study and discussions.The session proceeded further with the commencement of the first panel discussion moderated by Technical Adviser for Parliamentary Committees on Climate Change Waqar Ul Shams.Development Expert and former Executive Director CPDI, Amir Ejaz said the climate change division and environment had never been the cup of tea of any government in the budget as for the past five years from 2019 to 2023 on average less than one percent of the total development budget was earmarked for the environment.He underlined that the country’s international commitments and pledges to achieve 60 percent energy mix over renewable energy and 30 percent transport fleet over electric vehicles was difficult to achieve under the prevailing economic circumstances by the end of this decade.
