He assured the attendees that the government was committed to closing its tenure along with the National Assembly within the constitutional framework, as bound by law.\nSenator Azam Nazeer Tarar lauded the ECP’s proactive approach to ensuring free and fair elections.\nSpecial Secretary ECP, Zafar Iqbal, provided a comprehensive update on the progress made against the ECP’s third strategic plan (2019-2023). He said that the ECP had achieved 90% of implementation of its Strategic Plan and it was ready to hold free and fair general election in 2023.\nHe announced that the ECP was fully prepared to hold a free and fair general election, signaling its readiness to fulfill its vital role in the democratic process.\nHe underscores the ECP’s commitment to ensuring a credible electoral process and the tireless work it had undertaken towards this end.\nFormer Principal Secretary to the Prime Minister Fawad Hasan Fawad highlighted that the ECP required support and cooperation of the entire democratic society, citizens and parties to discharge its constitutional responsibility of holding free, fair and credible elections.\nHe said that census data was an important component of the election process since it served as the foundation for constituency delimitation and representation.\nThe difficulties encountered by smaller provinces in accepting census findings point to the necessity for increased openness and engagement throughout the census process, he added.\nHe said that the ECP should work closely with the census office to guarantee that the data obtained was accurate and approved by all stakeholders. The results of the census were also critical in order to avoid interrupting the election calendar, he added.\nPresident of PILDAT Ahmed Bilal Mehboob gave an overview of the Status of the Implementation of ECP’s 3rd Strategic Plan (2019-2023).\nHe emphasized the consistent effort by the ECP to strategize and improve their processes over the past 15 years.\nHe also highlighted the government’s role in facilitating the ECP’s work and how it impacts the electoral process. The ECP had exhibited a noteworthy dedication to strategic planning during the last 15 years, he added.\nHe said that the ECP’s commitment to refining its procedures and adjusting to changing conditions was shown by the development of a strategic plan every five years. Successful strategic plan execution requires collaboration with a diverse variety of stakeholders, including political parties, civil society, the media, and voters themselves, he added.\nSenator Syed Ali Zafar of the PTI in his comments emphasized that the General Election must be held latest by October 2023 and that the ECP had a critical role in safeguarding the democratic process.\n“It would be very surprising and shocking if a commission said we don’t want to hold elections,” he added, emphasizing the ECP’s constitutional obligation to hold elections.\nSenator Azam Nazeer Tarar, Federal Minister for Law and Justice, Zafar Iqbal, Special Secretary of the ECP, Fawad Hasan Fawad, Former Special Secretary to the Prime Minister, Senator Syed Ali Zafar, Mohsin Shahnawaz Ranjha, Senator Taj Haider, Senator Kamran Murtaza and Muhammad Abubakar addressed the seminar.",
