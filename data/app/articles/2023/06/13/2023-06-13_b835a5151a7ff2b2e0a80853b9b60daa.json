He demanded strict action against those who were involved in May 9 incidents and the state must enforce its writ and arrest all masterminds.\nSenator Prof Dr Mehar Taj Rohani suggested to allocate more funds in the health budget to address medical problems of the people and starting new health projects. She said more focus should be on prevention aspects of the diseases like diabetes and hypertension which are silent killer diseases.\nShe said more attention on preventive measures means protecting various precious lives and making the country’s people healthy and energetic. She suggested to make allocations for preventive programmes.\nSenator Molvi Faiz Muhammad said the government should pay more focus on natural resources in the Balochistan province to generate more revenue.",
