On the other hand, the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief used his workers to achieve his ulterior motives.\nThe minister said the general election would be held once the incumbent National Assembly completed its constitutional tenure and it was the responsibility of the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to hold polls in the country.\nShe said the PML-N was ready to contest the general election and it was the only party which had already launched its country-wide campaign in that regard. People turned out in big numbers in the public gatherings addressed by PML-N Chief Organizer Maryam Nawaz Sharif in different cities including Shujaabad, Vehari, Kasur and Lahore.\n“The masses are fully fed up with the politics of hatred and anarchy,” she said, adding the people would elect their representatives through ballot this time as a government which was imposed on them in 2018 had miserably failed.\n“The party which came into the government as a result of suspending the RTS has collapsed like a house of cards” and the people would never let that happen again, she added.\nTo a query, she said the PTI chief would be held accountable for his wrong deeds and orchestrating the May 9 incidents in the country. The people involved in the mayhem on that day would be dealt as per the law.\nShe said the coalition government would not have reformed the National Accountability Bureau laws, if it had wanted to victimize political opponents.\nDespite facing the worst form of political witch-hunt during the four years of PTI rule, the PML-N leadership did not play the victim card, she added.\nThe minister alleged that the PTI chief, soon after coming into the government, started victimisation of his opponents and sent all of them to jails and put some it death cells.\nShe said the masses had rejected the politics of hatred and chaos being pursued by the PTI as they knew it would hurt the country, which was heading into right direction because to people-friendly economic policies of the incumbent government.\nDue to the historic steps taken by Shehbaz Sharif led government in the agriculture sector, she said, the country had bumper crops last year in spite of the devastating floods.\nShe said the government had taken precautionary measures to cope with the cyclone which might hit the south of the country. Similar steps were taken last year to face the cyclone, she recalled.\nThe minister said the government had introduced many packages for youth, farmers and women in the budget for the fiscal year 2023-24.\nMarriyum said Rs 1 billion was allocated for health insurance of the journalists and media workers in the next year’s budget, which would help them meet their medical needs.\nThe health insurance scheme would be executed through the Press Information Department (PID) offices and a policy would be formulated in that regard within next two weeks, she added.\nThe minister said many media workers had visited the chamber of Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif when he was Leader of the Opposition in the National Assembly to request him for medical insurance, and the latter soon after coming into power, ordered to work out a scheme for the purpose.\n“The media persons were exposed to the worst state oppression during the four years of the PTI government,” she added, while assuring that the PML-N would continue to stand with journalists.\nShe said the the Security and Safety Bill, which was with the Parliamentary Committee on Information and Broadcasting, would be enacted soon.\nA fund for death claims of the journalists who lost their lives in accidents had also been included in the bill, she added.\n“Rs 1 billion for health insurance scheme has been announced, while the next announcement would be made regarding the security and safety bill soon,” she added.\nMarriyum said a circular regarding Rs 35,000 minimum wage had been sent to ITNE and PEMRA to ensure its implementation by the media outlets.\nShe further said the government had already set aside huge funds for the IT sector. The IT equipment for ‘Digital Labs’ in press clubs had been received in Islamabad and would be soon delivered to the press clubs, she added.\nThe minister said government offices were being shifted to the solar technology and promised that she would request Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif to approve solar panels for the Lahore Press Club.\nFederal Secretary Information and Broadcasting Sohail Ali Khan, Press Information Officer Mobashir Hassan and provincial secretary information were present on the occasion.\nEarlier on her arrival, LPC President Azam Chaudhry and Secretary Abdul Majeed Sajid received the the information minister and presented her a traditional shawl to express deep gratitude of the journalist community for the government’s welfare initiatives for them.",
