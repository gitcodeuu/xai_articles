Provision of payment through ATMs of HBL and Bank Alfalah would not be available, nor will any payment be made at the POS outside the campsite established by the BISP.\nAbout Rs. 81 billion will be disbursed among 9 million beneficiaries’ families of Benazir Kafaalat cash assistance, while another Rs 16 billion will be doled out to the 6.7 million beneficiaries of Taleemi Wazaif.\nIt is important to note that at the primary level Rs 2000/- is paid to a girl student while Rs1500 is given to a boy student.\nAt the secondary level, a girl student and a boy student are paid Rs 3000/- and Rs 2500/- respectively, while at the higher secondary level the stipend is Rs 4000/- and Rs 3500/- for the female and male students, respectively.\nFederal Minister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety and Chairperson BISP Shazia Marri in her message, has called upon the registered beneficiaries to receive the full amount of Rs 9000 along with receipt of payment.\nShe has directed the relevant officials to ensure transparency through strict monitoring and vigilance. She said that monitoring teams have to watch and supervise the cash disbursement process and ensure stern action against any complaint of leakage or deduction from beneficiaries’ precious cash assistance.\nShe stressed that the beneficiaries should receive their entire amount of Rs 9000/- plus a stipend of Benazir Taleemi Wazaif according to the gender or education level of their child.\nShe also emphasized to the beneficiaries to demand a receipt of their payment and to count and check their cash before leaving the POS desk.\nThe minister reiterated that in case of any complaint, the beneficiaries should immediately report to BISP’s toll-free helpline 0800-26477 and inform the BISP officer deputed at the campsite to ensure transparent disbursement of the cash.\nShe warned that the messages sent by BISP would come from 8171 only and that no message from any other number or code should be trusted, as such messages were faked and fraudulent.",
