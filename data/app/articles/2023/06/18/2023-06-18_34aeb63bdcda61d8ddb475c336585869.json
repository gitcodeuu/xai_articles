He said it was good that Pakistan’s relations with Russia and other countries were improving.\nHe said the supremacy of the law required everyone to avoid playing with the Constitution. The ulema of the country did not approve of political fights, he added.\nExpressing his grief over the loss of human lives in a boat, which capsized near Greece, he said peace would have to be restored in Pakistan if the youth were to be stopped from leaving the country for some job opportunities in other countries.\nHe demanded the prime minister and the interior minister should take action against those involved in sending Pakistani citizens abroad illegally.\nHe also appealed the chief justice of Pakistan to take suo moto notice of such events. He also express condolences to those who lost their lives in a bus accident near Kallar Kahar.\nHe said protests continued in the country throughout the year, but what happened on May 9 was first incident of its kind. “Does anyone in anger ever insult their martyrs,” he questioned.\nHe said the Army Act was not a new law and it had been in exercise for years, adding that punishments were given under the Army Act during Imran’s government also.\nHowever, he added, all those not involved in any vandalism on May 9 should be released.",
