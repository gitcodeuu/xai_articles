They feel passionately for their motherland.”\n“I explained to them the circumstances in which the coalition government assumed office as well as the mammoth economic, diplomatic and political challenges that the government had to deal with over the last one year,” he added.\n“In my talk, I also focused on the grave implications of the tragic incidents of May 9 including the careful & methodical build-up to the Black Day.
