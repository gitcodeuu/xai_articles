WED-2023 will showcase how countries, businesses and individuals are learning to use material more sustainably, offering hope that one day, plastic pollution will be history.”\nAdmiral Niazi underscored that it was a timely call since the world was being inundated by plastic. More than 400 million tonnes of plastic was produced every year, half of which was designed to be used only once. “Of that, less than 10% is recycled. An estimated 19-23 million tonnes end up in lakes, rivers and seas.\nToday, plastic clog our landfills, leaches into the ocean and is combusted into toxic smoke, making it one of the gravest threats to the planet. In addition, microplastics find their way into the food we eat, the water we drink and the air we breathe. Many plastic products contain hazardous additives, which pose a serious threat to our health.”\nPakistan Navy has embarked on numerous measures ranging from a collection of solid waste from the harbour, establishment of Reedbed plants in all areas under its jurisdiction and extensive tree plantation campaigns.\nIt also continues to sensitize concerned Government and non-Government organizations and departments to take effective measures against marine pollution. While awareness is deemed a vital factor, Field Commands and PN Units inculcate a sense of responsibility with practical steps amongst all to save and preserve our environment. I expect all under Command to launch dedicated efforts to make these activities worthwhile and result-oriented.\n“On this day, let us reaffirm our commitment and resolve to ensure a cleaner and safer environment which directly affects our quality of life. I would also urge the industrial community to embrace best practices and principles to synergize our efforts towards, practical ‘Solutions to Plastic Pollution’,” he said.",
