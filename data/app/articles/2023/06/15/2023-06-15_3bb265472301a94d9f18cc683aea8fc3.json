It would also help create a healthy partnership in green framework that would also create more economic opportunities between the two countries.\nThe agreement, he said would also help Pakistan to become an energy independent and economically prosperous country.\nThe foreign minister said the Danish government had been a leading voice and leading advocate for the green energy transition of climate agenda within Europe and Pakistan.\nHe said partnering with the European countries on this ambitious agenda of green energy transition would not only have positive implications on Pakistan within the climate context but the economy as well.\nTerming the agreement as very important, Danish Minister Dan Jorgensen said: “We share the same ambitions as we also want to fight climate change and both feel that international efforts to overcome the challenge are going too slow”.\nHe assured the foreign minister of his country’s full support in Pakistan’s fight against climate change. He also called upon the international community to cooperate with Pakistan in this regard.\nHe said Pakistan could be a superpower in wind energy keeping in view its location and wind potential. “We have decades of experience in wind energy, and we are ready to help Pakistan in this sector.”\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari said Pakistan and Denmark were facing the consequences of climate change in different scenarios as the latter was a developed country while Pakistan was a developing country.\n“I think it is a good example of how a developing world and the developed world partner together to find solutions and work together to face the challenge,” he added.",
