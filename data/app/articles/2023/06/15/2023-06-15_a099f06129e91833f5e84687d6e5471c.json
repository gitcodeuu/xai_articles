We as a nation will support Pakistan at all levels to achieve eco-friendly and sustainable transformation. As true transformation and preservation needs to go hand in hand focussing public, civil society and government nexus working together,” he added.\nThe Danish minister called the MHNP a model that not only preserved nature but rather engaged local communities to take ownership of the nature preserve which was unique and successful.\nResponding to APP’s queries, the Danish minister said the factor that the National Park was a community-engaged and owned protected area was also good for nature protection and changing people’s mindset to contain littering and damage to nature.\nHe mentioned that the Danish government was able to launch a new collaboration on green development with Pakistan that would ensure cooperation in green energy transformation.\nHe added that Denmark had vast experience of green energy transformation as it started its journey back in 1970.\n“We need to focus on clean and environment-friendly development as it appears to be a cost-intensive endeavour but it is a long-term investment that will pay back for generations. We have expertise in wind power, energy efficiency and water management and we will also share our waste-to-energy technological experiences,” he added.\nThe minister to another query replied that the waste should not be looked as a useless or discarded item but rather a solution.\nThe chairperson IWMB said the Danish Minister came especially to visit Trail-5 which was not only full of nature but well protected and looked after by the civil society.\nShe thanked the sponsors and others for assisting IWMB in managing the national park and also expressed her gratitude to the media for supporting IWMB’s protection efforts against encroachments and other threats to the national park.",
