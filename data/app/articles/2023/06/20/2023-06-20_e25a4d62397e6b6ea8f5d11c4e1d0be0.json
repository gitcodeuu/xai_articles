The project will be built with Chinese investment of $3.48 billion. Despite the inflation since being signed in 2017, China National Nuclear Cooperation did not increase the project cost. Rather, it gave a discount of 750 million RMB (Rs. 30 billion) on my request,” the prime minister commented.\nHe said Pakistan-China Iron Brotherhood continued to deepen and C-V vital project would add a new facet to that multilayered cooperative strategic partnership.",
