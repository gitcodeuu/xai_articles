  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 05 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi has directed COMSATS university to provide its student with a chance to complete his education as his future was at stake after the institution cancelled his admission.\nThe university cancelled the asmission after the student had already completed 7 out of 8 semesters of his degree, a President House press release said on Monday.\nCOMSATS had cancelled Hammad bin Zain’s admission after 3.5 years on the ground that he was not eligible for admission to the university in 2017 as he had obtained fewer marks than required.\nThe president said that it was surprising that the administration of the University could make such a huge error by granting him admission and then informing him, after a lapse of 3.5 years, that he was not eligible for admission.\nHe noted that the student paid his requisite fees for 8 semesters and diligently completed the semester course.\nHe added that justice demanded that COMSATS should rectify the situation by allowing the student to complete his degree program.\nPresident Alvi gave these orders while accepting a representation filed by Hammad bin Zain (the complainant) against the orders of the Wafaqi Mohtasib (WM).\nThe complainant had filed a complaint against COMSATS before Mohtasib, stating that it was the responsibility of the University to check the eligibility criteria and that he should have been denied admission in 2017, if he did not meet the requirements.\nThe Mohtasib, in its decision, did not provide any relief to the complainant and only ordered COMSATS to conduct an inquiry into the whole situation and hold the guilty officers/officials responsible for their negligence.\nThe president rejected Wafaqi Mohtasib’s decision by observing that the student was studying in the BS (Business Administration) program and had already completed 3.5 years of his degree program.\nHe said that since there was no allegation of misrepresentation against him, the student should not be made to suffer for the negligence committed by the University’s administration.\nHe noted that the student’s time, money and efforts would be wasted due to the cancellation of his admission.\nThe president accepted the student’s representation and directed COMSATS to restore Hammad bin Zain’s admission and report compliance to the Wafaqi Mohtasib.",
