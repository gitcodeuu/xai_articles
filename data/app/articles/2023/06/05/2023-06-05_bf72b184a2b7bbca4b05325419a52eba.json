  "content": "BAGH (AJK), Jun 5 (APP):Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Senior Vice President and Chief Organizer Maryam Nawaz on Monday said the journey of development, progress and development halted by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) in 2017 in Azad Jammu Kashmir (AJK) would start again with the arrival of Muhammad Nawaz Sharif.\nAddressing a big PML-N rally in Bagh in connection with the election campaign of party candidate Mushtaq Minhas, she said in the coming days, not only PML-N leader Muhammad Nawaz Sharif would win the elections in the AJK but also in Pakistan.\nShe said Nawaz Sharif always pursued the agenda of progress, prosperity and development in Pakistan and Kashmir whenever he came into power. Besides giving a road network, health and education facilities and a strong economy, he also disbursed Rs 100 billion for the development projects for AJK during his previous government tenure.\nThe PML-N leader said development in the Azad Jammu & Kashmir was ensured by the PML-N leadership as all the allocated funds were utilized without any corruption.\nThe development works carried out by Nawaz Sharif were visible across the Azad Jammu & Kashmir, she added.\nMaryam asked the masses to vote for the PML-N candidate in the Bagh area. “Voting for the PML-N means voting for development, progress and prosperity,” she added.\nShe paid tribute to the people of Bagh for attending the gathering in a large number. She said she was the daughter of Kashmir and bound in blood relation with its people.\nShe also paid tribute to the martyrs of the land who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to protect every inch of the motherland.\n“Every home in the Kashmir has a unique story of martyrdom of their loved ones, who sacrificed their present for a brighter future of the country’s coming generations,” she added.\nMaryam Nawaz said all citizens of Pakistan and AJK acknowledged and paid tribute to the army personnel for safeguarding the frontiers of the country. “Army personnel are performing their duties at the height of the mountains to protect their countrymen. We pay salute and tribute to the martyrs of both Pakistan and Kashmir.”\nCommenting of the May 9 incidents, the PML-N vice president said the nation would never forget those elements who disrespected monuments and memorials of national pride and installation of security departments, adding they would be dealt with in accordance with the law.\nShe said those who had disrespected the martyrs and put symbols of their bravery and courage on fire could not be regarded as Pakistanis anymore. The rioters even broke the fighter jets of 1965 war which was tantamount of attacking the pride of Pakistan Air Force (PAF) attained by defeating the enemy in the air war, she regretted.\nMaryam said Pakistanis despite having differences of opinion could not imagine burning Pakistan’s public and defence installations.\nShe said the May 9 incidents had hurt the sentiments of martyrs’ families, and brought embarrassment both at national and international levels. “We cannot dare to face the families of martyrs due to the incident of May 9.”\nMaryam Nawaz, without taking anyone’s name, said that the person who was behind all the destruction of May 9 was also responsible for compromising on the issue of Kashmir. “The nation will never forgive him and make him an example for others,” she added.\nShe said only one person was behind all the destruction, putting on fire the public and defence installations, fanning the politics of hate and division.\nThe PML-N leader alleged that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government was installed in the AJK by rigging the polls and “today the PTI is not seen anywhere in Kashmir.”\nShe said the party of a person who claimed to end the politics of PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif was now facing its own disintegration and had been divided into many groups.\nMaryam said the former AJK prime minister had disclosed that the May 9 incidents were planned by PTI Chairman Imran Khan.\nShe said the PML-N always played a central role in the progress, prosperity and development of Azad Jammu & Kashmir.",
