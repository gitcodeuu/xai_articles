As this year’s Environment Day theme was “Plastic Pollution”, by reducing micro-plastic consumption, “we can ensure proper utilization of food consumed by the humans and avoid plastic-toxicity”, he concluded.\nFaiz Rasool, Senior Policy Advisor of GAIN Pakistan said food safety was an important pillar to ensure food and nutrition security.\nThere was need to work for a National Food Safety Policy in Pakistan and “same goes for Multisectoral National Nutrition Policy”. Dietary guidelines were available but “these need to be translated into the practices and the food consumption approaches,” e added .\nIn the backdrop of Nutrition Emergency announced by the Government of Pakistan, he said, there was an immediate need to bring all like-minded organizations to strive for a national Nutrition and National Food Safety policies.
