He urged for collective wisdom and kickstarting reforms including privatization, managing of imports etc.\nHe stressed that we need to look inside, increase revenues, cut expenditures, and manage the macro-factors that are halting the much-needed reforms.\nDr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI said that the current budget surprisingly is not a populist one and shows the commitment to bringing the IMF program back on track.\nHe hoped that some budget numbers will be revised as coalition partners and provinces have expressed some reservations.\nHe further said that though faced with many challenges, the financing of the budget deficit will be made possible through both domestic and external sources, for example, from friendly countries like rollovers of 2 billion dollars from Saudi Arabia, 1 billion from UAE, new financing of 2.4 billion from IMF, 1.5 million from other financings, and commercial banks tripling their lending to the government.\nHowever, he stressed that these inflows depend on political stability in the country.\nHe proposed a third solution to the economic woes in the form of Charter of Economy which SDPI as well as Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Former President Asif Ali Zardari have both been strongly advocating.\nBridget Lamm, Country Director, FNF Pakistan, stressed that Pakistan is facing a crucial time and is confronted with complex economic challenges.\nThe spending projected in the budget will not be possible without large borrowings. She highlighted that the political and economic instability has triggered international companies to close their activities in Pakistan as many are struggling with production.\nShe highlighted that Pakistan has availed GSP plus better than other South Asian countries, but full potential was not explored. She said that the future of GSP plus relies significantly on stakeholders coming forward with tangible actions on international commitments, and political and economic stability in the country to restore the faltering interest of investors.\nShe said that if concrete plans for economic stability and reforms are not initiated, we will be missing out on economic opportunities and doing injustice to the youth of the country.\nDr Vaqar Ahmed, Joint Executive Director, SDPI called for a viable homegrown plan. He appreciated the efforts of Minister of State Dr Aisha Ghaus Pasha and Special Assistant to Prime Minister Romina Khurshid in moving forward and preparing a draft Charter of Economy for consideration by the PDM coalition.\nHe said that extensive multi-partisan engagement is underway which is good for strong buy-in for the Charter of Economy. He said that provinces will have to come forward and increase tax revenue mobilization efforts.\nHe highlighted that any charter of the economy should also stress, strict oversight of government expenditures, cost-cutting measures by merging government ministries and departments, and public procurement transparency.\nHe called for revising the debt management strategy and ensuring that future debt only finances the most productive investments and privatizing loss-making SOEs for which future debt accumulation is expected.\nHe further called for reforms in the energy sector by ensuring no hidden or cross-subsidies; tariffs in the energy sector must cover the full economic cost of generation, transmission, and distribution, and new contracts with provinces and IPPs.\nHe also suggested some low-hanging reforms e.g.,  improving the pensions framework, promoting regional trade, certainty of interest rates, trade finance rates, and energy tariffs for manufacturing industries.\nHe stressed the need for focusing on infrastructure development in economically backward areas, building domestic trade linkages across provinces, promoting local investments in the backward areas, and investing in human security and adaptive social protection.\nAnother pillar of the charter should be a drastic reduction in the cost of doing business, an easily achievable low-hanging fruit.\nHe called for an all-parties conference for forward-looking reforms for a progressive economic development narrative, building the commitment of provinces to these reforms.\nHe further said that any Charter of Economy should be given cover through proper legislation and follow up through the Council of Common Interests.",
