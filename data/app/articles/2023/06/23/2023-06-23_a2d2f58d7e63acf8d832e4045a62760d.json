  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP):International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking will be marked on  Monday to raise awareness of the major problem that illicit drugs represent to society.\nThis day is supported by individuals, communities and various organizations all over the world.\nThe UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has, over the years, been actively involved in launching campaigns to mobilize support for drug control. The UNODC often teams up with other organizations and encourages people in society to actively take part in these campaigns.\nGovernments, organizations and individuals in many countries, including Vietnam, Borneo and Thailand, have actively participated in promotional events and larger scale activities, such as public rallies and mass media involvement, to promote the awareness of dangers associated with illicit drugs.\nAccording to the UNODC, nearly 200 million people are using illicit drugs such as cocaine, cannabis, hallucinogens, opiates and sedative hypnotics worldwide.\nIn December 1987, the UN General Assembly decided to observe June 26 as the International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.\nThe UN was determined to help create an international society free of drug abuse.\nThis resolution recommended further action with regard to the report and conclusions of the 1987 International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.\nFollowing the resolution, the years 1991 to 2000 were heralded as the “United Nations Decade Against Drug Abuse”.\nIn 1998 the UN General Assembly adopted a political declaration to address the global drug problem. The declaration expresses UN members’ commitment to fighting the problem.",
