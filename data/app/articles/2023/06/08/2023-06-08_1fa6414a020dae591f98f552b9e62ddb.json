The supply source is the Galkynysh gas field in the eastern region of Turkmenistan whereas Pakistan’s off-take will be 1.3 BCFD with a pipeline dia of 56 inches.\nThe proposed route is Supply source – Herat – Kandahar – Chamman – Zhob – DG Khan – Multan – Fazilika with a pipeline length of 1849 KMs.\nThe engagements/interactions of the Turkmen delegation were characterised by mutual goodwill in a spirit of understanding, cooperation, and amity.\nThe Turkmen delegation offered its profound gratitude to its Pakistani “brothers” for their “traditional hospitality” and remained optimistic that bilateral ties between the two friendly countries would continue to expand in all spheres.\nThe TAPI project will be transformative towards the energy security of Pakistan.
