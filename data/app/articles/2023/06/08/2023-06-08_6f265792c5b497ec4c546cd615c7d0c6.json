The major contributions of income tax have come from contracts, imports, and profit payout.\nThe tax payments with tax declaration and collection on demand have also shown high growth, it added.\nThe gross and net sales tax collection during the period under review has Rs 2327.5 billion and Rs 2090 billion showing growths of around 1.7 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.\nAround 64 percent of total sales tax was contributed by sales tax on imports during the same period, while the rest was contributed by the domestic sector.\nAccording to the Economic Survey, the collection of Federal Excise Duty (FED) during the ten months of FY2023 has recorded a growth of 9.8 to Rs 281.2 billion from Rs 256 billion.\nThe major revenue spinners of FED are cigarettes, cement, beverages/food, motor cars, air travel, etc.\nCustoms duty has registered negative growth of 5.0 percent during July-April FY2023.\nThe net collection has declined from Rs 791.8 billion to Rs 751.9 billion during July-April FY2023, owing to the import compression policy for fiscal stabilization.\nThe major revenue spinners of customs duty have been mineral fuels, vehicles, edible oil, and machinery. The FBR is committed to achieving its assigned tax revenue target during FY 2023.\nAs part of the 9th Review under the Extended Fund Facility Program of the IMF, new revenue measures of Rs 170 billion were taken through Finance Supplementary Act, 2023 which came into force on February 23, 2023.\nHowever, the risks/challenges to FBR’s revenue outlook are unprecedented import compression, a slowdown in economic activity, and litigation of important revenue measures in the High Courts and the Supreme Court.\nThe revenue mix of the FBR comprises 49 percent of the revenue coming from the import of goods.\nThe import compression since the beginning of FY2023, which is more aggravated in the third quarter and fourth quarter of FY 2023 is hurting the revenue stream.\nThe super tax that was imposed in FY 2023 on high-earning persons has been challenged in the High Courts of Sindh, Punjab, and Islamabad.\nThe decision of the Sindh High Court is pending in appeal before the Honorable Supreme Court of Pakistan and the High Courts of Punjab and Islamabad have yet to decide the issue.\nAs interim relief to FBR, the Honorable Supreme Court has allowed 50 percent of the recovery of Super Tax, it added.",
