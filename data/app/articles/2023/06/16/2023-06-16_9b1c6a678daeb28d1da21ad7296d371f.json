Several of them also attended the ceremony.\nThe DG ISSI emphasized the importance of recognizing think tanks as a vital component of the policy eco-system.\n“They offer a vital platform to a range of stakeholders – most importantly scholars and policy-makers – to constructively engage, collaborate on ideas, generate research, and impact policy, he said.\nHe added that ISSI would continue its efforts to bridge the gap that traditionally existed between academics and practitioners.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood outlined that it would focus its endeavors on strengthening its interface with all relevant national institutions, promoting interaction with the private sector, civil society, and the youth.\nIn the realm of the global situation, the DG ISSI said that the world is going through another defining moment in history, with great-power contestation being the most prominent feature and a specter of bloc politics and a new cold war haunting the world.\n“Prudence demands that zero-sum perspectives are avoided, countries are spared the dilemma of making painful choices, and the main protagonists are convinced of the benefits of economic inter-dependence as well as the virtues of peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation,” he said.\nThe ceremony concluded with the cutting of a cake celebrating the Golden Jubilee and 50th Foundation Day of ISSI.",
