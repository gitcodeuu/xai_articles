The PMLN under the leadership of MNS has evolved overtime, emerging as the only federal party that has rid the country of multiple crises each time it was called upon to serve the motherland.”\n“Thanks to the unbreakable bond between the leadership & party workers, the PMLN has demonstrated remarkable resilience & bounced back stronger each time it was written off. Today my resolve to serve the country has got even stronger. I want to be remembered as a dedicated worker of Mian Nawaz Sharif who did his best to serve the cause of Pakistan & her people,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
