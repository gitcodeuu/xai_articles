Only 1800 CC car and petrol at par with federal secretary was being given to them.\nEarlier resuming debate on the budget, Senator Mushtaq Ahmed said that International Monterey Fund (IMF) wanted to default Pakistan and creating hurdles in disbursement of $ 1 billion tranche. Such tactics were being adopted to snatch atomic bomb facility of Pakistan, he added.\nHe suggested that elimination of elite and protocol culture besides curbing various ‘mafias’ were mandatory to address the key challenges to the national economy.He criticized the government for not giving any concrete plan for debt retiring, controlling inflation, civil and police reforms.\nHe said that the national debt has surged to record Rs 60,000 billion and the budget lacked any concrete plan to address this grave issue. He demanded that a commission should be formed to investigate who had borrowed these hefty loans and where it had been spent.\nHe said inflation has also touched to 38 per cent which was even more than Sri Lanka. There was no programme to overpower circular debt which was a result of mismanagement and poor governance, he added.He claimed that there was also dire need of reforms in FBR as there was leakage of Rs 1000 billion in it.\nHe said that in new merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, no development was carried out and no facility was extended to these areas.
