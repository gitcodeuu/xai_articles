Pakistan has clearly articulated its concerns. This is an ongoing process and we hope that steps would be taken to mitigate the terrorist threat.”\n“It is important that the threat of terrorism emanating from Afghanistan does not endanger the lives of Pakistani people, Pakistani civilians and personnel of Pakistani law enforcement agencies,” she added.\nOn the life loss of Pakistanis in the capsized boat off the coast of Greece, she said 12 Pakistani nationals were among the 104 survivors, who were in good physical condition.\nShe said the Greek authorities had recovered 82 bodies, however, the number and identification of Pakistani nationals among the deceased and missing was unconfirmed at the moment. Relevant authorities had started collecting DNA samples from the families of those suspected to be on board.\nShe said Pakistan’s Ambassador Aamar Aftab and his team at the mission in Greece were working round the clock for recovery and identification of Pakistani nationals.\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari had spoken to his Greek counterpart to discuss arrangements for the recovery of the missing, identification of the bodies, and providing relief to the survivors, she added.\nThe FO spokesperson said FM Bilawal Bhutto would undertake an official visit to Japan on July 2-3 July at the invitation of Japanese Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi.\nIn Tokyo, the foreign minister would hold substantive talks with his counterpart and discuss bilateral trade and investment, cooperation in science and technology, education, information technology, culture, and human resource development.\nThe two sides would also discuss important regional and global developments and cooperation and dialogue in multilateral forums.\nThe spokesperson announced that Pakistan and Kazakhstan would hold the second round of Bilateral Political Consultations on June 26 in Astana, Kazakhstan. Additional Foreign Secretary (Afghanistan & West Asia) Ambassador Syed Ahsan Raza Shah would lead the Pakistan delegation while the Kazakh side would be led by Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs Ambassador Kanat Tumyst.\n​The two sides would review the entire spectrum of bilateral relations in political, trade, economic, connectivity, science and technology, and cultural and people-to-people relations.\nThe FO spokesperson said thousands of people in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) were spending a homeless life and were unable to return to their homeland. “India must bring an end to the climate of fear and persecution in IIOJK and bring peace in the lives of the Kashmiri people.”\n​She said Pakistan would continue to extend political, diplomatic, and moral support to the Kashmiri brothers and sisters for the just and peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n​The inaugural session of the Bilateral Political Consultations (BPC) between Pakistan and Kazakhstan was held on February 28, 2020, in Islamabad.",
