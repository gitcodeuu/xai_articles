We are talking about 2 million people traveling five times in five days.\n“Hajj in the past was not like Hajj in our time, and it will be different in the future … information technology is one of the key elements in Hajj.”\nRegarding technology, Al-Gwinm said : “The Hajj smart bracelet will serve in tracking pilgrims and managing crowds.\n“Nusuk platform will help the pilgrim to choose the service operator for performing the rituals, as well as issuing the necessary permits and visas. It is the comprehensive application for the Hajj journey.\n“We also use the Tafweej platform, in which all transportation-related issues are included, to ensure that the pilgrims move from their homes in Makkah to the holy sites, and from there to the Grand Mosque easily.”\nThe Grand Hajj Symposium was established in 1970 and highlights Saudi Arabia’s esteemed regional and international position as a beacon of religion and culture.",
