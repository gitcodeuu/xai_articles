He sacrificed himself to save his life and became immortal forever.\nAccording to the local population, Mankyala Stupa was named after Raja Man or Manak. Mankyala Stupa is also considered to be one of the eighty-four thousand stupas built under the orders of Ashoka the Great. Every Buddhist in the world wishes to visit the holy places of the Gandhara period in Pakistan.",
