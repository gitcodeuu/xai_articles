This event gives everyone a chance to unite and voice their opinions against human torture.\nOrganizations, including the International Rehabilitation Council for Torture Victims and Amnesty International, have played an active role in organizing events around the world to promote the day.\nActivities may include photo exhibitions; the distribution of posters and other materials to boost people’s awareness of issues related to human torture; and television advertisements.\nOn June 26, 1987, the Convention against Torture came into force.\nIt was an important step in the process of globalizing human rights and acknowledging that torture and inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment should be universally illegal.\nIn 1997 the United Nations General Assembly decided to mark this historic date and designated June 26 each year as the International Day in Support of Victims of Torture.\nThe first International Day in Support of Victims of Torture was held on June 26, 1998.\nIt was a day when the United Nations appealed to all governments and members of civil society to take action to defeat torture and torturers everywhere.\nThe year marked the 50th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which proclaims that “no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment”.",
