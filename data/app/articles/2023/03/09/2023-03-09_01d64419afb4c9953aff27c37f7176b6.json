It mentioned that due to air pollution the average life of people was reduced by 2.7 years.\nAs per the 2016 report of the World Bank, Pakistan’s economy was suffering huge losses because of the air pollution problem.\nIn recent years, the number of accidents caused by smog in cities and different diseases spiraled.\nThe Ministry of Climate Change prepared an extensive policy covering a number of subjects, including the protection of health of citizens, steps to reduce per year deaths, promotion of agriculture, reduction in air pollution and for improvement in quality of air in urban and rural areas.\nThe policy recommended to encourage and promote upgradation of fuel from Euro 5 standard to Euro 6, introduce strict laws to control industrial emissions, modernize agriculture, effectively stop burning of crop waste, adopt international standards for waste management and use low emission gases in cooking.\nThe adoption of the policy would decrease emission of poisonous gases by 40 percent in the next 10 years.\nThe effective enactment of policy would be ensured by a National Action Committee, which would provide long-term guidance for its implementation and also bring changes in it after every five years keeping in view the ground realities.\nA technical committee would also be constituted to come up with a strategy to ensure the execution of the policy and send periodical reports to the National Action Committee.The committee would also present recommendations to remove obstacles in the way of the implementation of the policy.\nExecution of the clean air policy could lead to an increase in the average human life in Pakistan by two years.\nThe cabinet was also briefed on a strategy for fuel conservation. It was told that the ministries of Power, Petroleum, Industry and Commerce and Information were ensuring on a priority basis implementation of the targets set by the cabinet.\nOn the recommendation of the Ministry of Law and Justice, the National Accountability Amendment Ordinance 2023 was approved.\nThe recent amendments in the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 had created legal complications because of which it became difficult to transfer a lot of cases which did not come in the ambit of NAB ordinance, to other courts, tribunals and forums.\nAfter consultation with all stakeholders, the NAB Ordinance XVIII was amended after which the accountability courts would get a legal cover to transfer cases to other courts and forums.\nThe amendments would also end the perception that those cases which did not come under the purview of the NAB Ordinance, were decriminalized.\nThe cabinet also ratified the decisions made by the Economic Coordination Committee during its meetings held on March 1 and March 6.\nIt also ratified the decisions taken by the Cabinet Committee for Legislative Cases in its meeting held on March 6.",
