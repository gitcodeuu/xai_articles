  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 9 (APP):Ambassador of the EU to Pakistan, Dr Reena Kivinka here on Thursday said that the European Union (EU) and Pakistan were further strengthening ties to deal with challenges related to climate change, especially after the recent floods that wreaked havoc in the country, and to overcome barriers to gender equality.\nTalking to a private news channel, she said the EU had expressed solidarity with the flood victims of Pakistan, saying the catastrophe was caused due to climate change. She also highlighted the steps being taken by the EU in mitigating the effects of climate change.\nObserving that women were most vulnerable to such natural disasters, she said, “Around 85% of all new EU programmes will have a special focus on bringing gender equality in Pakistan, as the overall women’s participation in the decision-making process at home and community level is low.”\nShe stressed the need to empower rural women to build their resilience to reverse the impacts of natural calamities in an effective manner.\n“Climate change is a global problem and needs global cooperation,” she stressed.\n“We believe that formulating answers to non-traditional security challenges such as climate change and promoting global cooperation is mandatory for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)”, she added.\nTo another question, she replied, “Climate change is our top list priority area and the joint commission was constituted for providing an opportunity to exchange views on all areas of cooperation between both countries.”\nResponding to a question, Dr Reena replied the EU with the collaboration of the Government of Pakistan had devised a policy for practical solutions to fulfill the needs of mothers and children in the flood-hit areas, including their educational needs.\nReiterating the EU’s commitment in supporting women’s rights and empowerment, she said, “Gender equality and the fight against violence against women was the core of EU policies in Europe and other partner countries.”",
