The United Kingdom arranged a big gathering for queen’s coronation in which the head of the states, kings and crown princes participated. On this occasion, King Abdulaziz dispatched his son Prince Shah Fahad who was 30 years old to attend the ceremony, he added.\nHe said Prince Shah Fahad proceeded for London and attended the event. He noted that the man sitting behind him was the crown prince of Japan. At that time, neither he was a king or a crown prince but a simple prince.\nHe went to the Japanese crown prince and made him sit in his chair and he settled down himself in the Japanese crown prince’s place setting a high example of morality, the narrator maintained.\nHe said due to this courteous act of Prince Shah Fahad, the King of Japan issued a decree that whosoever would be the crown prince of Japan would pay his first visit to Saudi Arabia.\nSince that day, it was a prerequisite for the newly appointed crown prince of Japan that whenever he would plan any foreign trip, he would have to tour Saudi Arabia first, he added.\nHe said the Japanese dynasty was still committed to their words and implementing them in letter and spirit till this day.",
