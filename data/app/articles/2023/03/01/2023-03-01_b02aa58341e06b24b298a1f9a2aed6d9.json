He urged all stakeholders to work together to ensure the project’s success and underlined the importance of sustainable development for Pakistan’s future.\nHe added that the SAR project would support us in identifying Pakistan’s climate change vulnerability and enable us to address the impacts of climate change. SAR will also support us to take on board the insurance industry through the Global Risk Modelling Alliance (GRMA).\nHead of Development Cooperation, German Embassy, Dr. Sebastian Paust said, “Pakistan’s Nationally Determined Contributions outline a number of priority areas, such as strengthening early warning systems for extreme weather events, developing climate-resilient infrastructure, and improving water management and irrigation practices. Germany will support these strategic priorities towards achievement of Pakistan’s NDCs through the SAR project.”\nParticipants discussed the critical role of climate adaptation and resilience in alleviation of the impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities, ecosystems, and infrastructure. The speakers emphasized that the project’s success depends on collaboration and partnerships between various stakeholders, including the government, civil society, and private sector.\nThe launch ceremony brought together representatives from various government agencies, non-governmental organizations, civil society, and the private sector to emphasize the importance of climate change adaptation and resilience-building.\nThe launch of the Strengthening Climate Adaptation and Resilience Project in Pakistan marks a significant milestone in the country’s efforts to address the challenges of climate change. With the support of its partners, Pakistan is taking a bold step towards building resilience and adapting to the impacts of climate change, which will contribute to a more sustainable and resilient future for all.",
