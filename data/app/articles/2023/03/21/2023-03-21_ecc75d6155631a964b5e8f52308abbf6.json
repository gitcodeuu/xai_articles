The internship programme will help in addressing the critical entry barriers to the market and enhance employability, under which 60,000 paid internships will be awarded to young graduates from across Pakistan.\nTo eradicate the sense of deprivation from the people of Balochistan, who remained neglected in the past, the incumbent government initiated a scholarship programme for the students of Balochistan, and ex-FATA, under which around 5,000 scholarships will be awarded.\nThese scholarships will help the students of Balochistan and ex-FATA in pursuing their higher education in their respective fields.\nIt is for the first time that any government has started a project to uplift the 20 poorest districts for which funds of Rs 40 billion have been earmarked.\nPlanning Minister Professor Ahsan Iqbal has been actively pursuing the initiatives since he assumed charge in April 2022.\nDuring 2013-2017, Ahsan Iqbal under the Vision of 2025 had started several initiatives, but some of the projects were stopped by the previous government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), which are now being restarted again.\nAt the launching ceremony, the minister also took oath from Young Peace Development Corps (YPDC) that was attached to the country’s various universities.\nThe key objective of the YPDC is to bring young people together, exchange ideas and collaborate on projects, promoting peace and addressing root causes of conflict and violence in their communities\nEarlier speaking on the occasion, SAPM Shaza Fatima said the government was committed to providing a conducive and enabling environment to the youth so that they could be empowered, making them able to play a role in the socio-economic uplift of the country.",
