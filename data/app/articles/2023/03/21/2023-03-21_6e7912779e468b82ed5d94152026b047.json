We also need to devise five years and ten years management plans so the market forces and youth have a roadmap for a constructive future.”\nThe highlight of this dialogue was the discussion of thematic sessions titled “Employment, Education and Engagement” which provided a platform to Parliamentarians, Government representatives, academia, research institutions, CSOs, youth organizations and practitioners who have interests in youth-related policy topics.\nThe participants of the event held consultation with the stakeholders and produced conclusive policy briefs for the Government to mainstream youth voices and their demands in policy making.\nThe dialogue served as yet another example of the SDGs Secretariat’s commitment to its ongoing efforts for youth empowerment, development and inclusivity.",
