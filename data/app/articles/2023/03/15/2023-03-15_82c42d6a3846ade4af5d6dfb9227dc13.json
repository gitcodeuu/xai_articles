It was only a complaint.\nThe judge observed that bailable arrest warrants could be issued for a crime having less than three years imprisonment sentence, and the accused could also face a three-year jail term in the Toshakhana case.\nThe lawyer said Imran Khan wanted to appear before the court, but law enforcement agencies y had been deployed around his Zaman Park (Lahore) residence.
