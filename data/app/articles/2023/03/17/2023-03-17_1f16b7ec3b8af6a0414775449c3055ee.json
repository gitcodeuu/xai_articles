We will have to realise that losing our role and job we have paved the way for the unconstitutional forces to permeate into the system that should have to be condemned,” he added.\nEarlier, in his opening remarks, Chairman Senate, Muhammad Sadiq Sanjrani said it was his great pleasure to welcome all to the third day of the special commemorative session convened to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of the Senate of Pakistan.\n“Over the past two days, we have had the privilege of reflecting upon the achievements of the Senate over the past fifty years. Today, we renew our resolve for a better future towards building a better, brighter, and more prosperous Pakistan for all its citizens.\n“As we move forward, we must remain keenly aware of the challenges that lie ahead and prepare and work accordingly,” he said.\nHe said the country had faced significant economic, social, and political hurdles that must be overcome “if we were to achieve our goals and fulfill our responsibilities to our great nation.”\nHe underlined that there was also a need to realise that the country had the talent, the vision, and the commitment to meet these challenges head-on, and to build “a Pakistan that is stronger, more stable and prosperous”.\n“On behalf of the Senate of Pakistan, I extend my warmest thanks to all of our distinguished guests and Members for their presence here today, and for sharing their valuable views with us.”\nHe hoped that the collective wisdom of the guest speakers as well as former and present Members would contribute to the advancement of the shared goals and aspirations towards strengthening parliamentary diplomacy.\nThe chairman also presented a commemorative medallion and memento to the Senators after their address.\nSenator Maula Bux Chandio said it was imperative to ensure equal rights and implementation of law for all to end injustice and inequalities in the system.\nSenator Manzoor Ahmed Kakar said there was a need to focus on the future of our nation and country the youth that constitutes 60% of our population.He added that if the youth was left ignored and not given opportunities then the goal to achieve development and prosperity would be elusive.\nSenator Palwasha Khan urged all political parties to put all differences aside and work for the progress and prosperity of the country.She said that it was unfortunate; Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf had signed an unrealistic agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\nSenator Muhammad Qasim Khan said that 1973 constitution unanimously passed by all the political parties had united the whole nation under one flag.Senator Sajid Mir said that decisions made by the Parliament must be implemented in the country.",
