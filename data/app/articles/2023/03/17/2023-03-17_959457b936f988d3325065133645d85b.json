The move, they added, would drastically change the region’s political landscape besides influencing the outcome of election results in the future.\nThe speakers said that it was quite unfortunate that the so-called state machinery in the Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir was working on the whims and fantasies of the governor whose status in Kashmir was not more than an agent of the BJP government.\nReferring to a regime of new laws enforced in the region, they said that these laws were in contravention of UN Security Council resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir, international human rights, humanitarian law, 4th Geneva Conventions and India’s international obligations.",
