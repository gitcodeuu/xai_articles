He (Imran) on the other hand was not only defying court orders but also inciting his party workers to create anarchy, she added.\nPolice had no weapons and were hit with petrol bombs, sticks and stones, Marriyum Aurangzeb said addingdue to these criminal acts of PTI goons, 65 police personnel including DIG Operations, were injured and hospitalized.\n“Imran Khan is using party workers, women and children as human shields to avoid arrest and stoke unrest in the streets of Lahore”, she maintained.\nThe recent audio leak was proof that Imran Khan ordered his workers and senior party officials to procure petrol to use it as a weapon against the police contingent.\nImran Khan, she said was repeatedly given time by the courts but he did not appear and was, ” trying to influence the courts by his illegal action”.\n“Imagine what would happen if a leader of a mainstream political party in Britain defies courts, and incites his party workers for violence while hiding himself at home” she questioned.\nShe said instead of cooperating with law enforcement agencies Imran Khan was breaking the law.\nImran Khan cannot be allowed to create unrest and anarchy in the country, the minister maintained.",
