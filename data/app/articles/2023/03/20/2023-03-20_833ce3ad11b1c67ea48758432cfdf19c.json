The site is bordered on the south by the Institute of Animal Health.\nSpeaking at the foundation stone-laying ceremony, PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said that Pakistan was going through economic, political and constitutional crises.\nHe said that Sindh was being deprived of local bodies representatives. PPP was accused for not holding local elections, he said and asked now who was stopping this system from moving forward.\n“We have held the local body elections and now who is stopping the election of the Mayor?” he asked.\n“Some elements are hindering the election of a PPP Mayor and now our mandate is being robbed off,” said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.\n“The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) has given a date of April 18 during the month of Ramadan for the by-elections of local bodies in Sindh for the leftover UCs and the local bodies will elect their heads on April 30,” he said.\nHowever, Bilawal directed Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah and Law Minister Murtaza Wahab to immediately approach the Sindh High Court against the schedule issued by the ECP.\nThe foreign minister also expressed concerns over the ongoing digital census in the country and added that “we have drawn a red line on this matter”.\nThe PPP Chairman said that new free heart treatment hospitals were being established, adding there was no hospital in the whole world that could treat this number of patients for free.\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari said that under the 18th Constitutional Amendment, NICVD Karachi was handed over to the Sindh government in the year 2015, and now this institution had become the world’s largest free heart disease hospital.\nHe said the NICVD Sukkur was the largest hospital after NICVD Karachi, while there were satellite centers associated with this institution in Hyderabad and Larkana as well as in Tando Muhammad Khan, Sehwan, Nawabshah, Mithi and Khairpur.\nSeventeen chest pain units are functioning in Karachi, while such units are also functional in Ghotki, Tando Bago, Jacobabad, Umerkot, Tando Allahyar, Mirpurkhas and Shikarpur.\nHe further said the PPP was of the opinion that having no money should not be an obstacle in the treatment of a citizen, adding that NICVD Hospital of Sindh was ready to compete with any hospital in India and Europe.\nHe said that for the past 15 years, a few critics had been busy on targeting the Sindh government and were questioning what had PPP done. He said the well-performing NICVD was an answer to these opponents.\nHe said that those 70-year-old politicians who say that their struggle spanned 30 years and claimed rivers of milk and honey flowed during their rule but not a single hospital like NICVD was established in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Punjab provinces where they ruled. “I am 30 years old and in a short period of time I have made the world’s largest hospital for the free treatment of cardiovascular diseases,” he added.\nBilawal said that at present inflation, unemployment and poverty were on the rise and in these conditions, this was a gift for the people of the entire country including Sindh province.\nHe pointed out that more than one lac patients from other provinces had benefited through getting free of cost medical treatment in the hospitals built by the Sindh government. Medical treatment in Punjab and Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa was only for money while in Sindh free treatment was being provided to serve humanity.\nThe PPP Chairman said that in Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, there was a scam going on in the name of health cards, where public money was being given to private insurance companies instead of spending on hospitals.\nSpeaking on the occasion, the chief minister apprised the chairman about the new ZAB institute and about the health initiatives he had taken so far.\nHe said that after the commendable achievement of NICVD in cardiac quality care and treatment for the people of Pakistan, the ZAB institute would be another huge achievement of his government to establish a 1200-bed hospital,\nMurad Shah said that upon completion, the ZAB Institute of Cardiovascular Diseases would be the world’s largest cardiac center, catering to a projected population of 20 million in Karachi and also to the rest of the country.\n“This state-of-the-art complex will comprise seven buildings, occupying a total area of 2,400,000 square feet. Equipped with the most advanced medical technology,” he said and added that it would offer specialized cardiac medical services, including 16 major and minor operating rooms, 18 cardiac cath labs, two  MRI labs, four CT labs, and a range of imaging procedures.\nThe CM said the hospital would boast the country’s largest clinical and animal research facility, among other services.\n“Pakistan Peoples Party prides itself on always recognizing healthcare as one of its major priorities,” the chief minister said, adding that Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto always urged the party to focus on education and on health.\nTalking about SIUT Healthcare Model, the Community-Govt partnership, the CM said that between 2018 to 2022 the largest dialysis centre with 380 machines performed around 1350 sessions daily.\nHe said that the largest transplant center performed 6,844 kidney transplants with life-long follow-up and medications for both donors and recipients. The CM said that the center with five lithotripters treating a large number of stone diseases, dedicated pediatric urology, nephrology, and transplant center.\nHe added that it has a dedicated oncology hospital in the public sector with two radiotherapy machines and PET CT facilities.
