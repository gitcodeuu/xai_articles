Complete programme is totally secure, foolproof and under no stress or pressure, whatsoever,” a PM Office statement said.\nThe statement was issued in wake of all the recent statements, press releases, queries and various assertions regarding Pakistan’s nuclear and missile programme, being circulated on social and print media, wherein even a traditional routine visit of DG IAEA Rafael Mariano Grossi for peaceful nuclear programme was portrayed in negative spotlight.\nThe government said that the programme continued to fully serve the purpose for which this capability was developed.",
