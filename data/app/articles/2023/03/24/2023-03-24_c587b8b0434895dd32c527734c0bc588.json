houses of political workers had been raided, and citizens had been abducted without warrants and lawful justification.\nThe president said the incidents of human rights violations and oppression by state machinery against innocent citizens were in “clear breach and violations of fundamental rights” guaranteed by Article 4 of the Constitution, that “provides for, and guarantees citizens to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with the law”.\nHe also referred to Article 9 on ‘security of person’, Article 10 on ‘safeguards as to arrest and detention’, Article 10-A on ‘right to fair trial’, Article 14 on ‘inviolability of dignity of man etc.’, Article 15 on ‘freedom of movement etc.’, Article 16 on ‘freedom of assembly’, Article 17 on ‘freedom of association’ and Article 19 on ‘freedom of speech’, and said the spirit and mandate of these articles were being clearly transgressed.\n“This has tarnished the image of Pakistan in the international community and is casting negative repercussions on the future of democracy and state of human rights in Pakistan,” he added.\nPresident Alvi further highlighted that in the World Press Freedom Index of 2021, Pakistan ranked 145 out of 180 countries and dropped to 157 i.e., 12 points downwards in the World Press Freedom Index, 2022, which reflected the sorry state of affairs and “this year’s actions and images” would further exacerbate the country’s already dismal ranking.\nHe wrote that in recent months, media had been further suppressed and journalists had also been subjected to charges of sedition and terrorism to stifle dissent and criticism against the government. It appeared that a reign of terror had been unleashed against the media persons who had independent opinions, he added.\nThe president concluded that the prime minister, being head of the government, was responsible for the safeguard of human rights as well as fundamental rights of every citizen of Pakistan as enshrined in the Constitution, and therefore, all executive authorities concerned of federal and provincial governments should be directed to refrain from abuse of human rights and also to assist the ECP to hold general elections in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.",
