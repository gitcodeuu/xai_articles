  "content": "The free wheat flour is being distributed across Punjab and federal capital, under the Ramazan Package announced by the government to reduce the burden of inflation from the middle and low-income groups.\nThe prime minister, who was accompanied by Advisor Ahad Cheema and Special Assistant to PM Malik Ahmad Khan, interacted with the people including children at the distribution centers. He listened to the problems faced by them and issued instructions for their immediate redressal.\nHe directed the relevant authorities to continue the free flour distribution till 25th of Ramazan as per the program announced by the government.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz, who also distributed flour bags among the beneficiaries, inspected the process of flour supply with the officials checking the particulars of the people before guiding them to the distribution point.\nHe also visited the waiting room established to facilitate the beneficiaries of the flour scheme, particularly keeping in view the month of fasting.\n“No citizen should face any difficulty during Ramazan. Special attention should be given to the facilitation of old-aged and persons with disabilities,” he instructed and called for making arrangements to facilitate the women, particularly those coming with their children.\n“Don’t consider it just an official duty rather serve it as a humanitarian work to seek the blessings of Allah Almighty during Holy Ramazan.”\nThe Prime Minister appreciated the Secretary Food, Punjab Chief Secretary, Commissioner and Deputy Commissioner and other workers for good arrangements at the distribution centers.\nAs per the plan, around 15.8 million households of Punjab province would be distributed wheat flour, free of charge during the Holy Ramazan. It is for the first time in the country’s history that a package for the distribution of free wheat flour has been prepared.\nThe wheat flour distribution would continue till the 25th of Ramazan through 8,500 Utility Stores. Moreover, around 20,000 flour distribution points have also been set up to facilitate the people.",
