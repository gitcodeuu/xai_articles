The application included a scorecard of energy and water conservation as well as waste disposal.\nShe said those who would achieve high scores in these areas would be awarded medals, prizes and awards.\nThe main objective of the application was to create awareness among young generations about global issues like climate change, water scarcity and energy shortage, the minister said, adding it was her belief that initiatives like the Planet Champs would play a critical role in reducing waste of energy and water in the country.\nShe said the government had already made global issues like climate change and water scarcity part of the educational curriculum in the school so that the youth could play their role in saving the planet earth.\nWith this initiative, sensitization on these issues had also been made part of the informal education of the children, she added.\nShe said the initiative would engage children from across the country and a grand ceremony would also be organized in which Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif would distribute gifts among the high achievers of the Planet Champs.\nMarriyum extended gratitude to WWF-Pakistan for its technical support and also to the Citizen Foundation which would be registering students from 2000 schools with the application.\nShe also appreciated the efforts of renowned singer Haroon who developed the concept of the Planet Champs.\nThe minister urged all to play their role for the conservation of the mother earth.",
