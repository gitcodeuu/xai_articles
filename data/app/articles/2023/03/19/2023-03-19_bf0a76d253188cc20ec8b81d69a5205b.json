We remain committed to the cause and the multiple vaccination campaigns we have held since the floods are a testament to that commitment,” the Health Secretary said.\nMs. Agnes emphasized on strengthening the primary health care system, integrated disease surveillance and response systems and prioritizing preparedness for emerging and re-emerging diseases and future emergencies, including building the capacity of frontline workers for primary health care and other needs.\nMs. Agnes also mentioned how the polio infrastructure is a strength for the country and an opportunity for Pakistan to use it for other health and emergency responses post eradication.\nThe delegation members appreciated the progress Pakistan has made in polio eradication and pledged their support to keep Pakistan on track to interrupt the transmission of wild poliovirus this year, as envisioned in the global eradication strategy.\nMost of Pakistan has remained polio free for nearly two years. Wild poliovirus remains in circulation in seven districts of southern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where it continues to pose a threat to children with low immunity and poor nutrition.\nThe PEI, with support from its partners, has intensified vaccination schedules in these districts and continues to implement innovative strategies, such as vaccination of nomadic children and transit vaccinations, to reach every last child with the life-saving vaccine.",
