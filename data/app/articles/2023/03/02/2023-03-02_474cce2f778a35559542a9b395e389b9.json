Referring to the massive troops’ concentration in the disputed territory,\nThe president said India had turned Kashmir into a military garrison by deploying over 900,000 military and paramilitary troops in the IIOJK. The massive troops’ concentration, he said, had made the life of Kashmiris miserable.\n“Under the given circumstances, the onus of responsibility to draw world attention towards Indian brutality and barbarism in IIOJK lies with the Kashmiri expatriate community”, Barrister Chaudhry said, adding that it was a matter of serious concern that India’s apartheid regime had intensified its efforts to bring material change aimed at converting Muslim majority state into a minority.\nHe said the Modi government had also changed the region’s political landscape through bogus delimitation. In order to thwart India’s nefarious designs in the region, the president said that concerted efforts were required to raise these issues effectively at the global level.",
