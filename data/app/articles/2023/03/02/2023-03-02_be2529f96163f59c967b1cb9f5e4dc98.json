  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 2 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday directed the Power Division to hold a departmental action after the findings of an inquiry report held responsible the ‘human and technical error’ for the countrywide power breakdown of January 23.\nThe prime minister gave the order as the inquiry report of the massive power breakdown was presented in the cabinet meeting.\nChairing the meeting, PM Sharif said the nation was awaiting strict action against those responsible for the incident that left the country in a power blackout for several hours.\nThe inquiry report also said that an abnormal increase in the frequency of the alternate current line tripped the automatic security system of power plants.\nIt also said that the Kot Addu power plant had the facility of ‘black start’, however due to expiry of the contract of the plant, it could not be made operational. Black Start is the procedure to recover from a total or partial shutdown of the transmission system which has caused an extensive loss of supplies.\nThe prime minister ordered the authorities concerned to take necessary steps to line the power system with Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA).\nThe federal cabinet was proposed that a special police force be deployed in areas with 60 percent and more line losses.\nThe prime minister directed to constitute a special cabinet committee to finalize a strategy to end line losses, theft of electricity and solarization of tube wells.",
