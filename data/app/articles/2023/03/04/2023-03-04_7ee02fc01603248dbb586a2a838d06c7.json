He also condemned the use of inhumane laws on the Kashmiri people.\nHe also expressed concern about the plan of the Indian government to change the demography of Kashmir in its favour within the next few years.\nRehmani urged the civil society of Pakistan, especially the legal fraternity and human rights activists, to take note of the malicious intentions of the BJP regime regarding the Kashmiri Muslim inmates presently in different jails of India, who are not allowed to see the light of day.\nHe warned that the apathetic trend of major democracies and Muslim countries could lead to unexpected war-flames engulfing countries fighting for hegemony.\nRehmani called on the Indian government to repeal all inhumane laws, including the August 5 proclamation of 2019, from the occupied region of Jammu and Kashmir.\nHe said the termination of services of employers on fabricated grounds from their offices, demolishing of houses in the name of so-called encroachment policy and seizure and attachment of houses or shops of legal owners by the Indian government in the Occupied State and arresting and detaining and moreover denying the Kashmiri inmates their right to be free from jails even after decades.\nHe said that the magnitude of brutalities and use of other inhuman laws on the Kashmiris in the valley and Jammu speaks a lot and must be addressed by the UN at the earliest.\nIn case of failure to take action by the UN, he feared that the entire population of Kashmiri Muslims was under perpetual threat.\nOn the issue of Kashmiri Pandits, he said a peaceful coexistence and religious and cultural toleration between communities was a firm tradition of the past and the same could no less guarantee their mutual future.\nBut both communities should work for harmonious relations inside Kashmir and never be swayed by mischievous propaganda and raise their voices against acts of terror against each other.",
