The PPP always honoured the people by providing them maximum possible relief,” she said.\nShe, however, added that the country needed political stability to address challenges. Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari was performing an excellent role in the promotion of democratic norms and in serving the country amicably.\nCriticizing the opponents, Shazia stated some “favourites” were selected and they had nothing to do with the masses. She also promised for dualization of Khangrah road. PPP always fulfilled promises made to the public.\nShe observed that Imran Khan enjoyed helicopters for four years but did nothing for the masses. She stated that PPP knew many things against the opponents but it was focusing on resolving the issue of inflation.\nShazia also promised that the PPP would introduce a university in Muzaffargarh. She also announced the establishment of a Women Empowerment Centre in Khangarh.\nShe added that the strength of counters at the dynamic registry of BISP was also being enhanced.\nShe also informed that a 25 per cent increase in the three month installment had also been increased. Shazia Marri paid a rich tribute to veteran politician Nawabzada Nasarullah Khan for his matchless services for democracy.",
