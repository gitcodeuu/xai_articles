However, the court has yet not issued any order about the cancellation of their resignations, he added.\nThe SAPM said that PPP is ready for elections in the country, however, decision in this regard will be taken in accordance with the constitution. It is the duty of the Election Commission of Pakistan to announce the date of the elections.\nKundi termed PTI government responsible for worsening of economic situation in the country saying that we inherited devastated economy from PTI but we have taken the responsibility to put the country back on track and we are committed at doing so.\nHe said that Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) always respect courts and we want to make Pakistan a country where the law is equal for everyone. We don’t want to make courts political.",
