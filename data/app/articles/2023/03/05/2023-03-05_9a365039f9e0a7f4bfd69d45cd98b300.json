  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 05 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Sunday called Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan a “jackal” for hiding behind his workers to prevent his arrest in corruption cases.\nThe minister, in a tweet, said ironically, Imran Khan got bail in almost every case, whether it was related to “abusing a female judge or launching an attack on the court and police or concealing information about his[alleged] daughter from the court”.\nMarriyum in a satire asked Imran whether this time he would go to the court by a “truck”. “A proven jackal calls himself a leader,” she quipped.",
