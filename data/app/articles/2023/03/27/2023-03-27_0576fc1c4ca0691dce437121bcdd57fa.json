He also called upon people from all walks of life to support the government in its pro-poor efforts.\nHe said he would also pay unannounced visits to the flour distribution centres across the province to ensure smooth distribution of the bags to the people.\nEarlier, the prime minister met with the beneficiaries at the centre and inquire about the problems, they were facing while receiving the flour bags.\nThe Rawalpindi Commissioner briefed the PM about the distribution process and informed that four centers were working in the city.\nThe prime minister directed to resolve all the issues faced by the people at the earliest.\nHe also directed to accommodate other people from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan but living in the Punjab.",
