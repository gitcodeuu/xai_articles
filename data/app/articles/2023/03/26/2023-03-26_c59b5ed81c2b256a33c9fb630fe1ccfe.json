He said donations are coming from people from diversified faiths and soon the second phase of distribution of food rations will be made.\nWe used to make the arrangement for serving of big Iftari for fasting Muslims but corona pandemic affected the practice.\nLast year only on Friday iftaries were arranged in different areas of the city due to the shortage of volunteer, Jatinder added.\nApart from arranging Iftari, we are also focusing on provision of edible goods to fasting Muslims at their doorsteps, Jatinder apprised.\nBeing a dweller of city since generations, we know who is in need of financial support in our locality so we extend them help.\nThe objective behind this practice by Sikhs is to promote love, fraternity, respect and honor among people of different faiths, remarked Jatinder Singh, adding that we were living in this country from generations and wanted to convey the message of mutual coexistence among its citizens.\nJatinder said our Muslims neighbours and friends also mark respect to holy occasions of Sikhs by extending goods wishes.\nSimilarly both Muslims and Sikhs attend occasions of happiness and bereavement from both sides to maintain the bond of unity, neighbourhood and humanity.\nThe measures taken by Sikh community of Peshawar are receiving commendations from people from all walks of life and social media users are displaying these news as beauty of Pakistan where people of different religions are living in harmony and respect of each other.\nBilal Ahmad, a graduate from Peshawar who serves as volunteer in iftar dinner arranged by Sikhs, said he share these pictures on social media with a pride that how people of different faiths are living in conformity in our country.\n“In each Ramzan I spare time and participate in such iftar dinners to acknowledge the good initiative taken by Sikh community members in promoting respect and love in society by serving fasting Muslims,” opines Ahmad Khan, a young dweller of Peshawar.\n“This is very well coming gesture from Sikh community and is promoting the spirit of interfaith harmony,” comments Prof Abdul Ghafoor, a noted religious scholar, Former Director of Sheikh Zahid Islamic Center and Member of Central Reut-e-Hilal Committee.\nTalking to APP, Prof Ghafoor said such practices are winning hearts of Muslims and surely will help in achieving the goal of mutual coexistence.",
