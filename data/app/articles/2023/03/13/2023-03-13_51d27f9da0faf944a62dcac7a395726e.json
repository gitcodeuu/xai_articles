Instead of adjourning the hearing and delaying the hearing, the court should take action against Ladley (blue-eyed) Khan (Imran Khan),” Sherry Rehman said.\nImran Khan, she said, was playing with the lives of the PTI workers for his so-called politics. “Are those who take out bloody marches and rallies well-wishers of their workers and the country?” Sherry Rehman queried.",
