  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 13 (APP):A lower court of Islamabad on Monday issued non-bailable arrest warrants of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in the female judge threatening case and directed the police to produce the accused before it on March 29.\nSenior Civil Judge Rana Mujahid Raheem also rejected Imran Khan’s request for a one-time exemption from the appearance.\nThe court in its verdict, which was first reserved and later announced, said it had granted several opportunities to Imran Khan for appearance in his personal capacity and every time he requested for exemption.\nIt cited that the Islamabad High Court (IHC) had also declared the non-appearance of the accused on the excuse of security as irrelevant and ordered him to appear before the court on March 13. The accused had again requested for exemption from attendance today.\nThe court observed that the exemption request from appearance in a personal capacity was inappropriate and due to which the court was issuing non-bailable arrest warrants of Imran Khan.\nIt said that it would also serve notices to respondents on March 29, in the PTI chief’s acquittal plea.\nAt the outset of the hearing, the judge remarked that the court had summoned the accused to share copies of the case documents and he had to appear in person so that the trial could proceed.\nImran Khan’s lawyer Intizar Panjutha argued that there were security threats to the former prime minister as he had already faced an attack in Wazirabad. Moreover he was also not completely fit to appear before the court.\nHe said the officials deputed for his client’s security had also been withdrawn and a petition had been filed before the Lahore High Court in that regard. He prayed to the court to grant a one-time exemption from attendance to Imran Khan.\nSpecial Prosecutor Raja Rizwan Abbasi, on the occasion, opposed the exemption request of Imran Khan.\nImran Khan’s lawyer also filed an acquittal pea of his client.\nAfter hearing arguments, the court reserved its judgment and later issued non-bailable arrest warrants for the PTI chairman.\nIt may be mentioned that the Margalla Police Station Islamabad had registered a first information report against the PTI chief for his threatening remarks about Judge Zeba Chaudhry at a public gathering at F-9 Park.",
