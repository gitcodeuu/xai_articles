We will have to make collective efforts to beautify our cities and public places. This requires the engagement of youth as well as women to make them part of such healthy activities and beautify their surroundings,” she remarked.\nThe first lady appreciated the President of Orchid Chapter and Floral Society of Pakistan for playing their role to promote and transfer the good practices of healthy activities to the future generations.\nShe also congratulated the winners of the competition and lauded the Society’s members for promoting floral art through their dedication and hard work.\nThe first lady said the floral art could help the women express their creativity which also positively impacted the environment.\nFirst Lady Samina Alvi said the Floral Society of Pakistan was providing the women a platform for healthy and creative activities enabling them to showcase their talent and polish their skills.\nShe congratulated the Orchid Chapter Islamabad on its Silver Jubilee and urged the body to continue working to promote the art of floral arrangement and horticulture in Pakistan.",
