Experts of the field also discussed how trade can facilitate economic recovery and social development.\nSuch situations of recessions and uncertainties result in inequitable economic growth, but economic activities do not come to a halt rather they adapt to the context and the risk is that they are concentrated in small groups.\nAs knowledge leaders and global partners, all stakeholders of the global polity often engage to facilitate how best nonpartisan SDGs actors in both private and public sectors can continue with their services to consumers or citizens in such situations.\nCountry Director, Hashoo Foundation, Ayesha Khan welcomed the participants and shared that HF since the last 7 years, has focused on using knowledge or intellectual capital to produce actionable input for the betterment of individuals and communities.\nThe Foundation’s motto has always been “Together we make a difference” hence the collective wisdom from today’s session will help us find new and unique problem-solving ideas for technological and innovative approaches towards sustainable economic growth.\nShe emphasized the need to strengthen institutions and our development strategies to post-pandemic and Climate Change emergency realities emphasizing innovation, and entrepreneurship.\nDirector General, International Islamic University Prof. Dr. M. Zia Ul Haq joined the round table discussion as the guest speaker. He thanked Hashoo Foundation on bringing up this very important issue and working towards finding solutions. He highlighted the role of academia and researchers in working together with all stakeholders towards formulating a strategy for economic growth. He stressed on the need for an innovative, reform-based strategy for sustained economic growth acceleration in Pakistan.\nStakeholders from around the world as well as the public and private sector appreciated the initiative and actively participated in the process of supporting home-led solutions for socio-economic development.",
