Entry 42 of the federal Legislative List of the Fourth Schedule of the Constitution empowers Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) to make laws for the punishment, by a House, of persons who refuse to give evidence or produce documents before a Committee of a House, when duly required by the Chairman of the Committee to do so.\nTherefore, there is a need to frame law providing for punitive measures against persons who are reluctant to comply with the directions of a House of the Majlis-e-Shoora (Parliament) or a Committee thereof.\nThe Bill aims at condemning and awarding punishment for the actions that accounts for breach of the sovereignty and integrity of the prestigious House of the Majlis-e Shoora (Parliament) in any form or shade”.",
