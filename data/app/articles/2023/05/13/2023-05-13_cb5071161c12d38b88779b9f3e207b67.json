Moreover, he added, during protests staged at 221 spots in Punjab on May 9, 15,000 to 18,000 people participated.\nIn Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he said that protests were staged at 126 spots in which only 19,000-22,000 people participated. On the second day of protests, 1,900 participated in demonstrations in Islamabad, 2,200 in Punjab and 13,000 in KP, he added.\nSharing the numbers for the third-day protests, he said 515 people participated in Islamabad, 5,000 to 6,000 in KP and 800-1,000 in Punjab.\nHe said that the violent protesters were involved in the looting of shops and residences.\nThe minister vowed that “the gangs produced by PTI chief Imran Khan” would never be given forgiveness. “They will be identified through CCTV cameras and will not be allowed to go free.”\nInterior Minister Rana Sanaullah reiterated the stance of PML-N which took exception to a relief given to Imran Khan by the courts, saying that no one else was given such relief in Pakistan’s judicial and constitutional history.\n“After that, how can high courts and district courts dare to do anything then,” he said, adding that Imran was given whatever he asked for.\nHe said that the Islamabad High Court had given blanket relief to Imran Khan.\nThe minister said that from day one, it was the stance of political parties that Imran Khan was not a political leader instead he was a “Finta”.\nHe alleged that the prime objective of Imran Khan was to create unrest and chose in the country.\nThe interior minister said that Imran Khan should be removed from politics through votes, otherwise, he would put the country in danger.\nRana said that it was not the culture of the political parties to set defence installations on fire and attack the houses of political opponents.\nThe minister said that in past, despite the political differences, no political parties attacked each other homes.“Specific culture of attacking political opponents had been injected by Imran Khan in the country’s politics” he added.\nRana Sanaullah claimed that Imran’s objective was to “spread anarchy and chaos” in the country and his entire struggle was directed towards achieving this purpose.\n“Since 2014, he has created a cult,” the minister added.The minister questioned how political workers can stop the ambulance and attack the patients. “Can political workers set schools and Radio buildings on fire?” he asked.\nRana said that the animal market was first looted by the PTI miscreants and after that, they set it also on fire.The minister said that documented evidences were available of Rs. 60 billion in corruption committed by Imran Khan.\nThe minister said that Imran Khan and his wife were trustees of Al-Qadir Trust and both were accused of corruption of Rs. 60 billion and Imran Khan would have to answer.\nThe minister said that NAB sent a call of notices to Imran Khan after investigating a corruption case of Rs 60 billion.\n“Being an office holder, he has to answer for Rs. 60 billion corruption in an open and shut case,” he added.\n“Staging a protest was a political and democratic right of the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM), and accordingly, the political parties would present their point of view outside the Supreme Court premises,” he added.",
