The real culprits who showed this kind of enmity against the motherland should be arrested and produced in anti-terrorism courts under the relevant laws. These elements should be arrested immediately, without fear or favour,” he added.\nThe meeting was attended by Caretaker Chief Minister of Punjab Syed Moshin Naqvi and other relevant officials.\nThe prime minister said on May 9, terrible incidents occurred in the history of Pakistan. The Corps Commander (Jinnah House) was completely destroyed which was a painful sight.During the 75 years of country’s history, the enemy could not inflict such harm nor accomplish its evil dreams, but unfortunately, on May 9, under Imran Niazi’s supervision, planning and instigation his armed groups set Jinnah House on fire reducing it to ashes, besides harming the historic articles there.“Alas, as a Pakistani, I would not have lived to watch such a dreadful day,” he regretted, adding the people who were indulged in this abhorrent act, would be made to face criminal proceedings.Those who made plans and armed their rioters with weapons and batons to attack the law enforcement personnel and buildings would be dealt with iron hand, ‘so that they could become a permanent example for all that those who might act against Pakistan,’ added.The prime minister observed that the armed forces and the law enforcement personnel had been ever ready to sacrifice their lives to foil designs of the enemies, whether it was 65 war or in the fight against terrorism in which about 80,000 Pakistani lost their lives, including the armed forces officers, personnel, police, paramilitary forces and every member of society had sacrificed which led to crush the scourge of terrorism.“They have protected the motherland with their blood while leaving behind their bereaved families,” he said, adding the PTI rioters also defiled the shuhada and attacked their monuments.He said such were the heart wrenching scenes and had not been witnessed in the past history, adding that those armed groups should be made an example so that no one could dare to cast an evil eye on these institutions.He said about 12 billion rupees were spent on safe cities authority and it was the latest and biggest institution in the entire South Asia which was established during his tenure as Khadim-e-Ala Punjab under Nawaz Sharif’s leadership.But in the last five years of PTI’s rule, cameras had been lying dysfunctional, showing the sorrow state of affairs of the past government which also reflected the criminal negligence.\nOn his Twitter handle, the prime minister said that he had given the law enforcement apparatus, a target of 72 hours to arrest all those involved in facilitating, abetting and perpetrating the disgraceful incidents of arson, ransacking, sabotage and damaging public and private properties.He said all available resources including technological aid and intelligence were being deployed to chase down these elements.“Bringing these people to justice is a test case for the government. Their cases will be tried by the anti-terrorism courts,” he further posted in his tweet.",
