I cannot bear and think to disrespect our army,” the staunch companion of PTI chief said while addressing a press conference at NPC in Islamabad.\nHe said that the Pakistan army rendered a lot of sacrifices for the country and still they were offering their lives daily to protect the country.\nKiani announced his retirement with a heavy heart and said leaving PTI after 24 years was saddening, but he could not pursue his career as a politician in this grave situation.",
