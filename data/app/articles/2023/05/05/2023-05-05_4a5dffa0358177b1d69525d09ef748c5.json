  "content": "LONDON, May 5 (APP):Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif Thursday said legislation was the right of the Parliament and all the institutions should perform their role within the limits determined by the constitution because it was imperative for country’s integrity and security and for progress and prosperity of the people.\nTalking to media here, he said the coalition government was trying its best to tackle the challenges and Pakistan would come out of the difficulties.\nHe said justice should be seen to be done, adding betterment of people and country meant that the system should be run according to the constitution.\n“Everyone will have to play his role for the supremacy of the constitution. Everybody has to respect law and constitution.”\nHe said Parliament’s right to legislate was laid down in the constitution and this right could not be taken away, adding at present Parliament was playing its effective role.\nHe said the previous government victimized the opposition and put its leaders in jail in fabricated cases and they had no place to seek justice\nMembers of opposition were oppressed, were not even spared in sickness and women were arrested on Eid days and nobody cared, he recalled.\nHe said now others were getting speedy bails in dozens of cases at once and it all showed the double standards which nobody liked. Double standards were not healthy and beneficial for any society, he added.\nTo a question, he said due to better government policies, record production of wheat was achieved this year.",
