Democracy was a key component of the country’s Constitution, while a free judiciary and federation were also important features.\nHe said independence of the judiciary was a fundamental right and the case at hand was unique regarding the independence of the judiciary. The court expected serious arguments from the parties in the case as the law in question was the first of its kind in Pakistan. The law concerned the third pillar of the state.\nHe said an independent judiciary was a main feature of the Constitution.\nMeanwhile, the Supreme Court asked political parties and lawyers’ organizations to submit written arguments by May 8.",
