The distinguished panelists included Ghulam Muhammad Safi, Convener Tehreek e Hurriyat; Advocate Nasir Qadri, Executive Director Legal Forum for Kashmir; Abdur Rasheed Turabi, Former Ameer, Jamaat e Islami AJK; Dr. Nazir Hussain, Former Dean, Faculty of Social Sciences, QAU Islamabad; Ms. Farzana Yaqoob, Former Minister AJK; Ambassador Fauzia M Sana, Former Ambassador, DG Global, and Research ISSRA NDU and Ms. Sabah Aslam, Founder, and Executive Director IICR. Ambassador Abdul Basit, former High Commissioner to India, addressed the conference through a pre-recorded video message, said a press release issued here on Saturday.\nIn his opening remarks, Ambassador Maj Gen Dr Raza Muhammad said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and AJK government needed to develop a strong strategy to counter India’s nefarious designs in the valley. He demystified India’s normalcy facade post and illegal revocation of the special status of IIOJK.\nIndia’s objective behind organizing the G20 meeting in the occupied territory is to project the façade of normalcy in the region, he underlined. He also urged Pakistan’s foreign affairs to initiate a strong demarche to the G20 member states participating in the third tourism meeting of the G20 summit in the occupied territory. He formally opened the session for the distinguished panelists and experts.\nGhulam Muhammad Safi said that India has formed a smokescreen of democracy in the occupied territory of Jammu and Kashmir. He said that the successive UN resolutions clearly state that the dispossession of the disputed status of the erstwhile state is possible only through a free and impartial plebiscite.\nHe asserted that Kashmir was an internationally recognized dispute and all the bilateral agreements including the ShimlaAgreement shall be subject to the UN resolutions. India, since the day first of Kashmir’s occupation, has been engaged in the gradual erosion of Kashmir’s status and the unilateral actions of August 5, 2019, have been the master stroke that robbed the Kashmiris of their fundamental rights, he added.\nAdvocate Nasir Qadri highlighted the lack of proactive lawfare pertaining to the Kashmir issue from the successive governments of Pakistan.He underscored that India had initiated an all-out ‘legal’ action against Kashmiris to alter the status of the Kashmir issue and to implement its settler colonial program. “It is high time for the state of Pakistan to come clear on its policy on Kashmir and launch a sustained and proactive lawfare campaign to bring the perpetrators of atrocity crimes in IIOJK to justice”, he added.\nAbdul Rasheed Turabi lamented about the inaction of the state of Pakistan and the lack of effective and sustained Kashmir policy. He proposed immediate practical counteractions in IIOJK and AJK to highlight and expose the agenda behind conducting the G20 meeting in the region.\nHe assured that the Jamat-e-Islami Pakistan and AJK stood by their brethren in the occupied territory during these testing times. He reiterated the full support to the strike and protest call issued by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference AJK Chapter.\nAmbassador Abdul Basit, in his pre-recorded video message, highlighted the need for a well-calibrated multi-pronged strategy to counter India’s unilateral and unlawful actions in the occupied territory. He proposed the appointment of a special envoy on Kashmir and a plebiscite advisor by the AJK government.\nDr. Nazir Hussain elucidated the pressing need to frame a long-term Kashmir policy. He also proposed the appointment of a Permanent Special Rapporteur on Kashmir, along the lines of Palestine and Western Sahara. He urged that the AJK be declared as the bastion of Kashmir’s resistance movement.\nMs. Farzana Yaqoob urged the government of Pakistan to trust the people of AJK and GB, and to involve them in the policy-making on the Kashmir issue. While commenting on the Kashmiris’ legitimate right to self-defense, she underlined that Pakistan should not disown the Kashmiris fighting against India’s military occupation.\nAmbassador Fauzia M Sana, in her brief intervention, discussed the various thought processes on the Kashmir issue. Highlighting the inconsistencies of policies on the Kashmir issue, she said that there is a need for consistent Kashmir policy with no change in the stance. She asserted that Pakistan’s diplomatic fraternity will not shy away from its duties on the Kashmir issue.\nIn his concluding remarksthe Chair of the Conference, Ambassador Maj Gen Dr Raza Muhammad stated that Pakistan has never compromised on its principle stance on Kashmir and will do whatever it takes to assist Kashmiris in their just struggle for right to self-determination.\nMs. Sabah Aslam, Founder, and Executive Director IICR, thanked all the distinguished panelists and the participants of the conference. She urged the government of Pakistan to provide material support to the resistance movement beyond the rhetoric of political, moral, and diplomatic support.",
