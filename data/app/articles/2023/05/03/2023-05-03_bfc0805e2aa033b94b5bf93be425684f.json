He was committed to the Parliament’s sovereignty, he added.\nFederal Minister for Human Rights Riaz Hussain Pirzada emphasized that the courts should “fulfill their responsibility to dispense speedy justice” to the masses. He also urged the speaker begin the House’s proceedings on time\nPublic Accounts Committee (PAC) Chairman Noor Alam Khan reminded the House that as per the Constitution, the PAC was empowered to conduct audits of other institutions. He revealed that former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar had been summoned to provide details on the dam funds.\nChaudhry Muhammad Barjees Tahir supported Raja Riaz’s accusations, stating that the House’s proceedings record could not be shared with any other institution. He also recalled the important role played by all political parties in restoring the judiciary during the Musharraf era.\nFederal Minister Javed Latif said since the signing of the Charter of Democracy by the leadership of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), non-democratic elements had been targeting politicians.\nHe alleged that PTI Chairman Imran Khan was again being facilitated to attain power. He urged the speaker to seek details of plots allotted to former Chief Justice Saqib Nisar and others.\nHe emphasized the need to take concrete steps for preventing “the contempt of Parliament” Had the Parliament taken a firm stand in 2017 to foil the conspiracy targeting former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the situation would have been different today, he added.",
