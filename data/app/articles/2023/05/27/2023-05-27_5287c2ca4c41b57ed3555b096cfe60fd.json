The search for the remaining victims is still underway.\nThe injured individuals, described as being in critical condition, have been evacuated to DHQ Hospital Astore for urgent medical treatment.\nAccording to the GBDMA, the unfortunate incident occurred when a group of 25 people from the Gujjar family, accompanied by their livestock, were en route from Kashmir to Astore and were caught in the path of the avalanche.\nThe Fore Command Northern Areas (FCNA) has dispatched relief items and para-medical staff via helicopter, but their arrival at the site has been delayed due to inclement weather.\nThe GBDMA, along with the DDMA and other line agencies, has supplied essential relief items such as tents and food packs to assist those affected.\nThe district administration is closely monitoring the rescue operation, and an emergency has been declared at DHQ Hospital Astore, PHQ & RHQ Gilgit, and CMH Skardu.
