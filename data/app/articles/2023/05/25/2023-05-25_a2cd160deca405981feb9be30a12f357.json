Despite his fast deteriorating health condition, he was not provided much-needed life-saving medicines. #ReleaseYasinMalik pic.twitter.com/bcNWzRqXAe\n— Mushaal Hussein Mullick (@MushaalMullick) May 25, 2023\nMushaal, the wife of jailed Hurriyat leader Yasin Malik, urged that Kashmiri people across the world should raise their voices for the release of Yasin Malik and other Kashmiri people detained in Indian jails for their crimes to raise voice for their birthright of right to self-determination.\nOn the occasion, Mushaal said that the Hindutva regime crossed all limits of barbarity and atrocity, as Yasin Malik was deprived of all legal, fundamental and constitutional rights.\nThe hurriyat leader lamented that despite his fast deteriorating health condition, he was not provided much-needed life-saving medicines.\nThe Chairperson expressed her apprehension that her husband was moving towards slow death due to the government’s callous attitude towards him coupled with the non-provision of required medicines and continued mental and physical torture.\nMushaal stated that the brutal authorities used all fascist tactics to convince him to shun the peaceful freedom struggle for Kashmiri people but they miserably failed.\nShe stated that the fascist Modi regime has failed to break Yasin Malik’s resolve for freedom despite using all inhuman and illegal tactics. Therefore, she demanded that it was time to act now to end illegal detention of Yasin Malik before it was too late because his life was in danger.\nMushaal strongly condemned the undemocratic and inhuman approach of Narendra Modi-led fascist government towards Yasin Malik who was denied all legal and medical facilities.\nShe said that if anything bad happened to Yasin, the Indian state would be held responsible for his murder.\nShe urged that the international community and UN bodies should shun the duplicity and should also raise such collective supporting voice for Yasin Malik and Kashmiris who have been struggling for their birth rights like they are doing in the case of Ukraine.\nMushaal said that Yasin Malik, who was facing serious health issues, but even then neither he was provided medical nor legal assistance, demanded her husband’s immediate release due to his precarious health condition.\nMushaal urged the world community and so-called human rights organisations to raise their voices against Yasin Malik and other Kshmiris illegal detainees to force Indian government to ensure their release from unlawful detentions.\nPresident Islamabad High Court Bar Association Naveed Malik and Secretary Bar Council Mirza Amir Tahir also spoke on the occasion and shed light on the Indian barbarism unleashed on the innocent Kashmiri people in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).",
