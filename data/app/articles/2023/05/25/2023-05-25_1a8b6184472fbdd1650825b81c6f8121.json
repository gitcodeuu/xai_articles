People of Pakistan are most affected by terrorism,” he added.\nHe said that Pakistan wanted to fight terrorism in the best interest of the country.\nThe minister said that positive and productive meetings with all the foreign ministers of the members’ countries were held on the sideline of the event.\nHe said it was decided before leaving for India not to hold bilateral meetings with Indian leadership due to the August 2019 unilateral decision of India.“It is our principled stance that we will not seek a meeting with our Indian counterpart,” he added.\nHe was of the view that the SCO meeting also provided an opportunity to interact with Indian people, senior anchors and media persons and counter the Indian narrative of linking terrorism with Pakistan and Muslims.\nHe said that Pakistan would host the SCO conference in 2026-2027 and there was hope the Indian counterpart would attend the meeting.Responding to a question, the minister said, that soon after arriving from India at Karachi Airport, he effectively responded to the allegations of Indians in the SCO conference.\nHe said that diplomatic channels had also been used to respond to the Indian allegations.\nResponding to a question regarding Afghanistan, he said a stable, prosperous and secure Afghanistan was in the interest of people of Afghanistan, Pakistan and other neighbouring countries.\nHe said that it was the request of the interim government of Afghanistan to address the core issue of TTP operating from its soil against Pakistan.\nHe said that after the taking over of the interim Afghanistan government, terrorist attacks in Pakistan had increased.\nHe said that issue of Afghanistan had also been discussed with the participants of the SCO conference during sideline meetings.\nAbout relations with Saudi Arabia and Iran, he appreciated the role of China in bringing closer Saudi Arabia and Iran.\n“China has proved itself as super power and peacemaker” he added.\nHe said that improved relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia would also bring a positive effect on Pakistan.\nHe said that the Indian decision to hold the Group of 20 Youth and Tourism convention in Indian-Occupied Kashmir was condemnable.\nHe said the holding of the meeting indicated that India did not care about the United Nations resolution.\n“You cannot dream of being a superpower by violating international laws and resolutions of the United Nations,” he added.\nHe said that during his stay in India, he told the Indians that they would not achieve 100 per cent participation because the meeting was being held in the disputed area.\n“I could not find a single international media report on the conference in Indian Occupied Jammu Kashmir confined to tourism and youth affairs. Every report discusses disputed areas and action of 2019 and Human Rights abuses,” he added.\nThe minister said that India failed to give impression of normalcy in Indian-Occupied Kashmir.",
