  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 24 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday expressing his resolve to bring the elements behind May 9 arson and vandalism attacks to justice, reiterated that the entire nation would not let such ‘barbaric incidents’ happen in future.\nThe prime minister assured that as chief executive of the country, it was his onus to ensure legal proceedings under the law and constitution, against all those rioters and miscreants who had planned, abetted and executed attacks on different civilian and military installations across the country.\nThe prime minister was addressing “Azmat e Shuhada Convention” held here to pay tribute to the country’s martyrs.\nThe convention was attended by a large number of families of shuhada, governors, members of parliament, ministers, provincial ministers, ambassadors, legislators, civil society members, ulema and senior officials.\nThe prime minister said that incidents of May 9 were intolerable and unpardonable as the monuments and statues of Shuhada of armed forces and law enforcing agencies were vandalized.\n“We will not let it happen again and will keep the national flag high. We will not allow anyone to malign our armed forces,” he said, adding that they would bring all the perpetrators of May 9 incidents to face the law.\nAs the prime minister, he assured that the law would take its course, stressing that people behind the incidents would not be given any concession and would not be pardoned as ‘they had crossed the red line’.\nHe said, those elements also hurt sentiments of the families of shuhada. A heart wrenching spectacle was never witnessed in the past.\nHowever, the prime minister reiterated that no innocent would be framed in these criminal cases.\nReferring to the unfortunate incidents on that day, he said if Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief Imran Niazi had  instigated his followers to create such a mayhem.\nHe said country’s history was replete with different cases of politicians. Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Shaeed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif faced  arrests and trials upon baseless allegations, but their followers never went violent and damaged the country.\n“During the previous tenure of PTI, the entire opposition was pushed to the wall, but they faced all the ordeals with fortitude and never thought to mount any attack on any civilian or military installations,” he maintained.\nTerming May 9 incidents as ‘highly lamentable’ in the country’s history, he said on the other hand, the PTI’s chief was arrested in a corruption case, but prior to it, he was inciting his followers to spread violence by attacking different civilian and military installations in case of his arrest.\nThe prime minister said the whole nation wanted an answer from the PTI’s leadership as to why Quaid’s House, Radio Pakistan and other buildings were ransacked and torched to ashes.\nHe further said even India could not achieve its nefarious designs after waging 1965 war, but the leadership of PTI and its followers inflicted huge damage to the country, adding “The nation will not forgive it.”\nThe prime minister said Quaid’s Pakistan existed due to the sacrifices of shuhada, they had left behind their orphan children but saved the coming generations.\nPaying tribute to martyrs, he said the martyrs of the nation, even did not care for their lives thus securing peace for the nation. It was all due to their precious blood they shed for the nation and its future. Business of life went on due to their sacrifices, he added.\nThe prime minister said that these shuhada did not belong to one party or group, they were respected by the nation and it should be borne in mind that by holding of shuhada convention, they reaffirmed their resolve that such esteem and affection for the shuhada would be maintained forever.\nThe prime minister said if there was any trouble inside the country or at the country’s borders including threats of terrorism, the officers and personnel of the armed forces, law enforcing agencies and police force faced them with valour.\nThe prime minister also stressed upon inculcating the young generations with the ideals of the founder of the nation Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah including the democratic norms, patience and tolerance.\nThe prime minister also went to the different members of families of shuhada and interacted with them.\nMinister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Professor Ahsan Iqbal, in his address, condemned the May 9 attacks on state buildings and military installations in several cities.\nPaying tributes to the country’s martyrs, he reiterated firm commitment not to tolerate such illegal and unconstitutional acts in future.\nSamar Bilour, a leader of Awami National Party, Maulana Raghib Naeemi, a renowned religious scholar, Minister for IT Ameen ul Haque, and Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman also spoke on the occasion.\nThey paid tribute to martyrs and their families and denounced the incidents of May 9 which amounted to anti-state activities.",
