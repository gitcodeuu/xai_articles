Since August 5, 2019, India has started large-scale changes in IIOJK to grab the territory. He said that the Indian government can not hoodwink the world on Kashmir.\n“The world knows well that India has deployed over 900,000 military and paramilitary troops in the region”, he said, adding that what kind of tourism can be promoted in the region that has been classified as the world’s most militarized zone.\nCastigating the Indian government for its repressive policies against minorities, especially Muslims, the president said that rising tides of xenophobia and intolerance within Indian society would lead to the disintegration of India and Modi would prove to be India’s Gorbachev.",
