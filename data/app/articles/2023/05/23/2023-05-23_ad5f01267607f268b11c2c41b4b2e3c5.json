However, there is still a long way to go. This May we are bringing together experts to discuss the most pressing issues for Pakistan’s population dynamics. I look forward to working with all our partners to support Pakistan’s strategies to maintain a sustainable future to all,” said Jo Moir, Development Director, British High Commission, Pakistan.\nDAFPAK is a £90m, multi-year program designed to improve family planning outcomes across Pakistan.

With a flexible and adaptive approach, KhairKhwah campaigns have already reached over 95 million people, amplifying the reach of all DAFPAK’s valued partners who have made these results possible with their constant efforts.\nThis event is sure to be an exciting opportunity for experts and participants alike to come together and discuss the challenges and opportunities related to family planning, ensuring a valuable and enriching experience for all.",
