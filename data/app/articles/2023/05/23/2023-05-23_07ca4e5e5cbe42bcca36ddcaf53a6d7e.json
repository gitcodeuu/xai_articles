Being tax free, these schemes will induce and promote national savings.\nPSE also proposed it should be considered that the changes in policies should be prospective rather than retrospective in nature. Therefore, the government is requested to rectify all such amendments which have retrospective effect so that all the amendments made have a prospective effect.\nGovernment of Pakistan must move away from short term measures and frequent changes to tax treatment and adopt long term measures to promote savings and investment and development of the capital market.",
