  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 10 (APP):Federal Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives,  Ahsan Iqbal Wednesday advised the university students to sharpen their mental strength which he termed as  key to success.\nThe minister was addressing a ceremony held at HEC Secretariat in connection with distribution of electric wheelchairs among students under the last phase of the Prime Minister’s Electric Wheelchair for University Students.\nAs many as 50 students received electric wheelchairs during the ceremony.\nIn the first phase of the scheme, launched in 2017, 206 electric wheelchairs were provided to physically challenged university students, while 159 wheelchairs were handed over to students in the second phase.\nGiving example of the famous scientist, Stephen Hawking, Ahsan Iqbal said that an otherwise healthy person with no use of mental capabilities was worthless, while a physically challenged person who utilized their mind could mark great achievements.\n“The future of Pakistan depends on making right decisions on time, as any wrong decision can put the country’s future at stake. A country’s development gets haunted if there is lack of patience, perseverance as well as consistency of policies,” he added.\nIn his remarks, Chairman HEC Dr. Mukhtar Ahmed appreciated the minister for conceiving the idea of facilitating the physically challenged university students through provision of electric wheelchairs in 2016-17 and taking practical measures for its execution.\nHe said that HEC had collected the data of physically challenged university students particularly those with mobility issues, visual impairment, and hearing problems and as the next stage of the scheme, these students would be provided with gadgets and tools required.\n“HEC is committed to delivering in light of the Vision 2025 of the Government,” he asserted.\nSome wheelchair recipients appreciated the Government and HEC for effectively implementing the Prime Minister’s Electric Wheelchair Scheme.\nThe ceremony was also attended by Executive Director HEC Dr. Shaista Sohail, Director General (Scholarships) HEC Aayesha Ikram and other senior officers of the commission.\nLater, the minister launched HEC’s Research for Innovation (RFI) portal.\nThe Executive Director HEC briefed the minister on the salient features of the RFI portal and how it would strengthen the linkage among academia, industry and government to accelerate the process of commercialising the academic research.\nThe minister appreciated the objectives of the portal and hoped that it would strengthen the linkages among academia, industry and the government.",
