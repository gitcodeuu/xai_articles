The Chief Guest underscored that completion of the Type 054 A/P Project is a major leap towards strengthening capabilities to respond to maritime threats and contribution to peace and stability in the region.\nTowards the end, the Admiral thanked and praised the concerted efforts made by all major stakeholders involved in the development of the ships including BOMETEC, SASTIND, PLA (N), HZ Shipyard and CSTC for the timely completion of the project despite pandemic challenges.\nThe contract for four multi-role frigates (Type 054-A/P) for Pakistan Navy was signed between Pakistan and China in 2018. The first and second ships PNS TUGHRIL and PNS TAIMUR joined the PN fleet in 2022. The development of these state-of-the-art naval units for Pakistan Navy is hinged upon modern stealth design with the capability to simultaneously engage in multiple naval operations to counter maritime threats.\nThe 4000 tons frigates are technologically advanced and highly capable platforms having enormous surface-to-surface, land attack, surface-to-air and underwater firepower coupled with extensive surveillance potential. These ships will provide deterrence and means for averting threats in our region while contributing towards the protection of Sea Lines of Communications (SLOCS).\nThe ceremony was attended by high level Civil & Military dignitaries including the Ambassador of Pakistan to China and officials of Hudong Zhonghua Shipyard.",
