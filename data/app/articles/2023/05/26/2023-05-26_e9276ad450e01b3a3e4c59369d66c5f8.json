Benazir Bhutto was martyred, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was judicially murdered and Nawaz Sharif was mistreated but Pakistan never faced such instability. “Even enemy cannot think what happened on May 9.”He said our armed forces faced the enemy with bravery in the wars and now it was unfortunate to see that on May 9, barbaric acts were committed and monuments of ours martyrs were desecrated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
