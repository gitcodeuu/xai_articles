  "content": "KARACHI, May 26 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that no one should object if Government of Pakistan punished the arsonists of May 9 as per law, the way the United States had done to its citizens for storming the Capitol building on January 6, 2021.\n“Today, in the city of Quaid, we all are ashamed for what happened on May 9 in Lahore. The justice requires to punish the perpetrators like the rioters of Capitol building on January 6, 2021. If that punishment was legal, then no one should object if we do so under our law for the desecration of our martyrs,” the prime minister said.\nAddressing the groundbreaking ceremony of K-IV water supply project here, the prime minister said the politics of political chaos culminated on May 9 in the form of desecration of nation’s martyrs, Ghazis and security installations.\nHe said the strings of the May 9 conspiracy were attached to abroad and that the desecration of martyrs and installations on the instigation of Imran Niazi was the darkest chapter in the nation’s history.\nRecalling his recent interaction with the family members of martyrs, the prime minister said their dear ones had rendered sacrifices for the country but the arsonists desecrated their monuments.\nThe prime minister said the person who always blamed others for plunders had resorted to arsons when arrested on charges of corruption.\n“What kind of politics is this,” he questioned and said no political leader in the past ever instigated an attack on Jinnah House or military installations, despite having faced many difficulties.\nHe said the leaders of MQM and PPP – both representing Sindh – gave a message of national unity which was a must for national development.\nHe said the coalition government coped with huge challenges through collective wisdom, including floods, inflation, IMF and also the nefarious designs of chaotic politics which culminated on the darkest day of May 9.\nCommitting to revive Pakistan’s lost grandeur, the prime minister lamented the unnecessary delay in the K-IV project that was meant to provide drinking water to millions of the Karachi people.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz asked the relevant ministries to provide uninterrupted funding to ensure project’s completion without further delay.\nHe said the project was “most important” for him because the people of a Quaid’s city, were deprived of the drinking water, despite it being a city with the highest revenue generation and taxation.\nThe prime minister assured that he would put the project at top priority in the upcoming budget and provide maximum funds for its early completion.\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari said the prime minister was keenly focusing the development of Sindh, particularly Karachi.\nHe said the two major political parties of Karachi voted the prime minister and his government enjoyed “super majority” in Sindh.\nHe said the people of Sindh also pinned hopes at the prime minister for resolution of their issues.\nBilawal said K-IV project faced immense delay and that Karachi needed “Shehbaz Speed” for resolution of its issues.\nRegarding the floods, the foreign minister said the concerted efforts were needed for rehabilitation of the people in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, South Punjab and other areas, including the metropolises.\nHe said around 52 percent of Sindh’s educational infrastructure had been damaged by the floods impacting the education of around 47 percent population.\nBilawal Bhutto said the leaders of the PPP, MQM and other parties also faced jails and other hardships but they always stood for the democracy, without resorting to the violence.\nMinister for Water Resources Syed Khursheed Shah said the project was of utmost important to meet Karachi’s water needs.\nHe said The first phase would provide 260 million gallons of water to the city.\nHe also requested the prime minister to announce K-5 project as the K-4 would be insufficient to cope with the future needs.\nShah said due to government’s efforts and dedication, the country would neither default nor its economy would destabilize.\nMinister for Maritime Affairs Faisal Sabzwari said the K-IV project was also part of the agreement between the MQM and the ruling coalition. He said unnecessary delay in the project led to huge increase in the cost.\nHe said the whole province including Sindh chief minister had serious reservations on the census.\nSindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah said starting from 2002, the project was used to be an example of ill-planning and had faced immense delay.\nThe project would accumulatively cost around Rs200 billion which could have been around Rs100 billon had it been started timely.\nHe said storage of Keenjhar Lake would have to be enhanced as the Irrigation Department has already proposed a project for the water body’s expansion.\nHe urged the federal government to ensure provision of funds for timely completion of the project.\nSindh Governor Kamran Tessori said under the leadership of prime minister and Foreign Minister Bilawal, the project was moving ahead.\nHe said for the first time, the federal and provincial government were on the same page to execute the much delayed project.\nHe said the May 9 like incidents had united the nation and thwarted the designs of the miscreants.\nIn his address, WAPDA Chairman Engr Lt Gen Sajjad Ghani (Retd) said K-IV water project would supply 650 million gallons of water to Karachi. The first phase would provide 260 million gallons and 390 million gallons to be supplied in the second phase.\nHe said under the project, a 111 kilometer long pipeline would be laid from Keenjhar Lake to Karachi.\nThe first phase would cost Rs126 billion as Rs33 billion had already been spent on the project.\nForeign Minister Bilawal Bhutto, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal, Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb, Water Resources Minister Syed Khursheed Shah, Maritime Affairs Minister Faisal Sabzwari, Syed Qaim Ali Shah and others were also present.",
