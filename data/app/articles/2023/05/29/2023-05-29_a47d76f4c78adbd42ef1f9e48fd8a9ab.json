They highlighted the flagrant violation of international laws and the blatant disregard for the Kashmiri people’s right to self-determination that such a decision represents. It served as a reminder of the obstinacy displayed by India and its persistent denial of the Kashmiri people’s legitimate aspirations.\nThe speakers further shed light on the lack of international involvement in the Kashmir dispute and the prevalent double standards exhibited by global institutions. This inconsistency and selective approach cast doubts on the prospects for peace not only in the region but also on a global scale.\nThe plight of the Kashmiri people and their yearning for self-determination were underscored, emphasizing the urgent need for the international community’s attention and action.\nAmidst these discussions, the speakers urged the Pakistani government to adopt an assertive and effective foreign policy stance regarding the Kashmir dispute. They emphasized the dire consequences of India’s unwavering stubbornness, state oppression, and acts of terrorism that had plagued the Kashmiri people for the past 75 years.\nThe participants called for solidarity and collective efforts to address the challenges faced by Kashmir, as well as to ensure justice, peace, and the realization of the Kashmiri people’s long-awaited aspirations.\nThe seminar concluded with a renewed sense of determination to advocate for the rights of the Kashmiri people and to create awareness at both national and international levels. The gathering served as a powerful platform for raising voices and demanding justice, with the hope that through dialogue, engagement, and diplomatic efforts, a resolution can be found for the long-standing Kashmir dispute.",
