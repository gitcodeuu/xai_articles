  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 15 (APP): The Joint sitting of Parliament took up legislative business on Monday and passed eight bills including a government bill.\nMinister for Law and Justice Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar moved the National Accountability (Amendment) Bill, 2023 which was sent back to parliament by the President for reconsideration. The minister said that bill has been returned to the Parliament on the grounds that amendments brought earlier in the National Accountability Ordinance 1999 were sub-judice before the Supreme Court.\nThe minister said that the power and authority of the Parliament is absolute and no institution can stop the Parliament from legislation. He said that President is also part of Parliament but he does not know that the authority of Parliament is absolute and it cannot be stopped from legislation on sub-judice issues.\nHe said that the new law guarantees fair trial as per the constitution and it would check political engineering. The bill seeks to remove the legal complication in the transfer of cases from the Accountability Court to the relevant forums which do not fall within the jurisdiction of the NAB Ordinance.The sitting rejected the amendments moved by the JI Senator Mushtaq Ahmed proposed in the bill.\nAnother bill – the Protection of Parents Bill, 2022 – was deferred on the request of the Minister for Law and Justice.\nMoved by MQM lawmaker Kishwer Zehra, the House passed the Transplantation of Human Organs and Tissues (Amendment) Bill, 2021.
