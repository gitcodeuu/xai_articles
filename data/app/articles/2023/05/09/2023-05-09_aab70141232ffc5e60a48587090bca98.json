He urged the people to keep their conduct as per law and the Constitution.\nThe Law Minister said Imran Khan’s arrest was not unlawful confinement while on the contrary, the opposition leaders during his government tenure faced the worst kind of political vindictiveness.\nHe said during the PTI rule, opposition leaders were arrested in one case and prosecuted in another one.\nThe minister said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz-led coalition government had nothing to do with NAB.
