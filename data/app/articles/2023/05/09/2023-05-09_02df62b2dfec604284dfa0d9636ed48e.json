With such baseless and outrageous allegations, he is inciting his workers. He is making allegations without evidence.”\nShe took exceptions to Imran Khan’s narrative saying, “On the one hand, he is accusing the institutions and on the other hand requesting meetings with them.”\nImran Khan was attacked on 3rd November last year which we all condemned, she said, adding, by January 12th, his government was established in Punjab. “What did his provincial government investigate regarding this attack?” she queried.",
