Seven billion, Naeem disclosed. He said the gigantic exercise is the first ever in the South Asia region and will be followed by neighbouring countries in coming years.\nAbout the details of the 2023 census, Dr Naeem said that would be uploaded online in January of 2024 after which people can benefit from it by getting a lot of information on the required sector. The digital census completed in a timeline of around 18 months also holds the distinction of first-ever uncontroversial census, he claimed.\nMember PBS, Muhammad Sarwar Gondal said the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics is committed to providing accurate, reliable and accurate data for informed decision-making.\nIn this latest digital census, data of around 33 indicators are given by geo-tagging 40 million structures, he added.
