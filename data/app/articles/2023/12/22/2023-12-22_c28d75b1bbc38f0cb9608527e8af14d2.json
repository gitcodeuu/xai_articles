  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 22 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Friday reserved its verdict in cases pertaining to the powers of Public Accounts Committee to summon NAB officials in the Tayyaba Gul harassment case.\nChief Justice Aamer Farooq reserved the verdict after hearing arguments from the two sides.\nDuring the course of proceedings, Additional Attorney General Munawar Dogal said that the committee had the authority to summon the officials as per the rules.\nThe chief justice inquired as to why Tayyaba Gul had approached the PAC instead of the Federal Investigation Authority (FIA) or anti-corruption department. He said the PAC could not directly summon the head of any institution on the complaint of someone.\nThe court reserved the verdict after the two sides concluded their arguments.\nIt may be mentioned here that the PAC had summoned former National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman Justice (retd) Javed Iqbal and director general on the complaint of Tayyaba Gul.",
