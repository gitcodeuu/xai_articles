The discussion was moderated by Ammar Tobba, VP, of Public Affairs and Communications, Huawei Middle East and Central Asia Region.\nThe panelists also shared their thoughts on driving digital transformation, building a sustainable knowledge-based digital economy in the region, and raising national competitiveness in line with the government’s national plans and visions.\nGender equality in technology was also highlighted as a pressing need during the discussion.\nThe forum was attended by university students and tutors, government partners, information technology (IT) professionals, academia, and media representatives from 11 Middle East and Central Asia participating countries.\nDr Hessa Jassim Al-Junaid underlined the importance of an open collaboration between universities and the public and private sectors to develop curriculum and upskilling students on the latest technologies, such as 5G and Cyber Security.\nShe said, “The Huawei ICT Talent initiative offers students practical skill development opportunities through hands-on challenges and real-world scenarios facilitated by Huawei professionals and experts. It fosters critical thinking and confidence-building among participants.\nWinning or receiving recognition in the competition can serve as a valuable addition to a student’s academic portfolio, highlighting their accomplishments.”\n“Annually, the Huawei ICT Talent competition attracts a growing number of registered students, indicating its increasing popularity.\nThe College of IT students who have taken part in the Huawei ICT Talent competition have demonstrated high employability due to the competition’s provision of relevant skills, industry knowledge, problem-solving abilities, teamwork experience, and industry recognition.\n“Additionally, the competition encourages students to pursue Huawei professional certifications that hold international recognition,” Dr. Hessa added.\nA recent study by PwC estimated that AI could contribute up to $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030.\nDr Jassim Haji explained how the technology would impact undergraduate engineers.\n“AI tools are poised to transform the way talented students learn and create, offering a wealth of benefits such as guidelines to the job market, the course selection, and curriculum advisory. Furthermore, generative AI creates tests tailored to each student’s learning preferences, interactive activities, or even life-like simulations,” he elaborated.\nDr Tilda Karkour Akiki shared her thoughts on how ICT students could contribute to today’s industrial digital transformation and the urgent need to narrow the ICT talent gap, especially to encourage more participation from women.\nShe elaborated, “Empowering women in ICT is not just about diversity; it’s a strategic imperative for sustainable innovation. It secures a more inclusive and resilient future where diverse perspectives in digital solutions shape our world and where innovation has no limit. With both determination and empathy, women leading the way will transform challenges into opportunities and will promote collaborative environments where every voice is heard.”\nAmr Hashem deliberated on cultivating young talent for the telecommunications industry, especially in light of the accelerated deployment of 5G.\nHe said, “At the GSMA, we believe that investing in the development of ICT talent is crucial for the future success of the telecommunications industry. The rapid deployment of 5G technology requires a skilled workforce capable of driving innovation and meeting the evolving demands of the digital era.\nBy fostering collaboration between academia and industry through initiatives like the Huawei ICT Competition, we can empower the next generation of professionals and ensure a sustainable and thriving future for the ICT sector in the Middle East and Central Asia.”\nAmmar Tobba shared, “ICT talent development programmes like the Huawei ICT Competition contribute towards bridging the digital divide and narrowing the digital skills gap, nurturing young industry talents and strengthening the ICT talent ecosystem across the region. As a global technology leader, Huawei is committed to supporting the national plans and vision of regional governments to build a robust knowledge-based digital economy driven by local talents.”",
