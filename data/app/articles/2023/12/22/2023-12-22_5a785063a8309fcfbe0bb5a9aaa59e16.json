It went without saying how important and relevant that universal message remained for the entire humanity today, he added.\n“We are committed to promote harmony, ensure fundamental rights and equal opportunities for all Pakistanis as equal citizens as guided by the vision of our Founding Father Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.”\nThe ambassador appreciated the contributions of the Pakistani Christian community, both in Pakistan and abroad, where they were the key pillars of Pakistani diaspora.\nThe Christian community remained proud contributors towards the establishment of Pakistan going back to 1947 – and decades of nation building ever since, he added.\n“They are and will always remain an essential and integral part of our multicultural society,” he asserted.\nWhile outlining the active role of Pakistan at the international level, the ambassador duly recognized many friends who had over the years worked with the country in building bridges across nations and civilizations.\nThe ambassador also shared that the United Nations General Assembly had recently unanimously adopted the traditional resolution jointly presented by the Philippines and Pakistan on the “promotion of inter-religious and inter cultural dialogue, understanding and cooperation for peace”.\nThe Christmas dinner was attended by a large number of French friends and families, Pakistani Christian community, diplomats and people from all walks of life. Guests were treated with traditional Pakistani food while goody bags brought more smiles to the children.\nThe officers and staff of the embassy also attended the event marking Christmas celebrations.",
