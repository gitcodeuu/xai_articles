In our increasingly digital world, the prevalence of malware and malicious attacks underscores the critical importance of cybersecurity. The evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates constant innovation to outpace malicious actors” Dr. Saif added.\nHe said that as informed, 6 teams represented Pakistan at Blackhat’s cybersecurity competition in Saudi Arabia this year and 4 of them were ranked in the top 35 teams out of 250 international teams who participated in the event.\nHe termed a good first step by Pakistan and Ignite and said “I hope we have at least one team in the top 10 teams at next year’s Blackhat competition.”\nRecognizing the need for robust collaboration, the IT Minister emphasizes the importance of a partnership between the government, private sector, and academia.\nThe private sector’s support for cybersecurity initiatives is pivotal, and the government encouraged ongoing collaboration to fortify our cybersecurity defenses.\nIn his welcome address Chief Executive Officer IGNITE, Mr. Asim Shehryar Hussain said, the IT Ministry and Ignite are on a relentless pursuit of identifying and nurturing talent capable of thwarting malicious cyber attempts on our national networks.\n“Our progress is evident in the establishment of operational readiness for Pakistan’s National Computer Emergency Response Team (NCERT) and the imminent institutionalization of a Cyber Security Authority. Creating awareness about cybersecurity among the public is\nparamount” he said.\nEarlier, Ignite successfully conducted the scheduled hands-on training sessions in 10 cities, complemented by a special 3-day training session tailored for government sector employees held in Islamabad.\nMoreover, regional hackathon rounds were conducted in Karachi, Lahore, Multan, Peshawar, Quetta, and Islamabad.\nIt is worth mentioning here that before the awards ceremony, 21 teams from 6 cities were vying for cash awards totaling Rs. 3 million contested each other in a grand finale.\nFurthermore, participants in the hands-on training sessions received training vouchers worth Rs. 6 million, with awards extended to the top 50 individuals.\nThis comprehensive program underscored our commitment to skill development and innovation, fostering collaboration across various sectors.\nNotably, the top three winning teams from last year’s hackathon have already been granted international sponsorship. These teams secured their positions in the Black Hat Me competition held in November 2023 at Riyadh, KSA.\nThis achievement reflects the high caliber of our participants and the success of our ongoing initiatives.",
