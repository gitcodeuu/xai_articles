The forces recovered weapons, ammunition and explosives during the operations.\nHowever, in the early hours of December 12, a group of six terrorists attacked a security forces’ post in the general area Daraban.\nThe attempt to enter the post was effectively thwarted which forced the terrorists to ram an explosive-laden vehicle into the post, followed by a suicide bombing attack.\nThe resulting blasts led to the collapse of the building, causing multiple causalities; twenty three brave soldiers embraced Shahadat, while all six terrorists were effectively engaged and sent to hell.\n“Sanitization operations are being conducted to eliminate any other terrorist present in the area, as security forces of Pakistan are determined to wipe out the menace of terrorism from the country and such sacrifices of our brave soldiers further strengthen our resolve,” the ISPR said.",
