Naek had filed an application on behalf of Bilawal Bhutto to become the respondent in the case. The lawyer told the court that only one daughter of Zulifqar Ali Bhutto was still alive.\nThe order said that the court was told that there were eight grandsons and granddaughters of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto (ZAB). Anyone from the heirs could engage a lawyer if required.
