Our focus is on building a robust and resilient healthcare system that meets the diverse needs of our population.”\nHe said approximately 500 Basic Health Units across the country would be upgraded in a short time under an agreement between the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation (WHO).\nThe minister said that understanding the disease burden in the country was crucial for effective health planning and resource allocation.\n“The burden of disease in the country was 42,369 DALYs (disability-adjusted life year) lost per 100,000 population in 2021, showing significantly improved performance in maternal and child health, with the forthcoming challenge of tackling non-communicable diseases and mental health issues.\n“On this UHC Day, we recommit ourselves to addressing the root causes of the burden and working collaboratively towards a healthier, more resilient society.”\nDr Nadeem Jan expressed gratitude to healthcare professionals, frontline workers, and all stakeholders involved in the pursuit of Universal Health Coverage.\n“The Government of Pakistan remains steadfast in its dedication to advancing healthcare policies that ensure health for all citizens, leaving no one behind,” he added.\nMeanwhile, the WHO Head of Mission appreciated the Government of Pakistan for taking the PHC approach to building stronger, more resilient health systems to achieve the UHC goal.\nThis will ensure that more people are covered with essential health services and are empowered to participate in making the decisions that affect their health and well-being.\nWHO has joined hands with Ministry of Health since the beginning, for the expansion of Universal Health Coverage by investing in health systems, especially in PHC.",
