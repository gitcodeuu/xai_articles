The perpetrators of these custodial killings must be held accountable.\nIndia’s brutal occupation is the root cause of all major issues in IIOJK. The Kashmiri people must realize their inalienable right to self-determination, as enshrined in the relevant UN Security Council resolutions, she added.",
