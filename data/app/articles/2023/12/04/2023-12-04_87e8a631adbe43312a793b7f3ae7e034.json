  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 04 (APP): The Design Vetting Committee of the Capital Development Authority (CDA) on Monday granted formal approval for the building plan of the Competition Commission of Pakistan, which definitely marks a new era for the CCP.\nThe construction of new the building will eventually enable CCP to further expand its operations within its current budget across other cities innthe wake of surging costs of rent, utilities, and staff hiring, due to inflation, said an official of CCP.\nIn year 2018, the CDA had allocated plots, spanning 5.5 kanals in Sector G-10/4, Mauve Area to CCP. The building plan did counter the roadblocks, thus delaying the entire project for two years.\nThe proposed building plan reflects a future-oriented design, encompassing state-of-the-art office spaces. This features a dedicated hearing room, an information resource centre, and a crèche facility tailored for female employee — an embodiment of CCP’s commitment to fostering a modern and inclusive workspace.",
