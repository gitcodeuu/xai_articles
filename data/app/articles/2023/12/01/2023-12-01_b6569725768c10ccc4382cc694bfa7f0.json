  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 01 (APP): The protest demonstrations have erupted in Srinagar seeking the arrest of a Hindutva supporter Prathamesh Shinde who made blasphemous remarks against Holy Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).\nA 20-year-old student from Maharashtra at the National Institute of Technology (NIT), Srinagar had posted derogatory content on the social media which triggered protests.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir Police has also booked the student but the Indian authorities are avoiding to arrest the accused.\nInstead of arresting the accused, the Indian police have sent him into hiding which shows discriminatory approach of the Narendra Modi regime towards the minorities.\nThe FIR registered at Nigeen Police Station in Srinagar mentions that the student’s actions “have hurt the religious sentiments of a particular community with a potential to disrupt communal harmony and can create law and order situation within and outside the campus.”\nAs one of students sent the recording to the college administration, the accused student was asked to escape from the campus.\nRealising inaction by the authorities, the students gathered outside the gate to demand punishment against the accused.\nHundreds of the social media posts also criticised Indian government for arresting the Muslims even for celebrating the Australian victory in the the World Cup but a Hindu committing blasphemy is being protected by the government despite the fact that the act had hurt the sentiments of the Muslims worldwide.\nThe act is also being dubbed as a way to fan religious hatred which also manifests the anti-Muslim mindset of literate Hindus.\nRecently, in a series of incidents, the Indian Hindus in the Middle East had posted anti-Islam content on social media which necessitated action by the Muslim world leaders.\nThe Islamophobia is growing in the Indian society and Hindutva supporters are using it as a political tool.\nThe sane elements on the social media urged the United Nations, Organisation of Islamic Cooperation and the international community to pressure the Modi government for taking action against the Hindutva supporter for committing blasphemy.\nThey also called for Muslim states to boycott India and action to limit the Indian expatriates working in the Middle East.",
