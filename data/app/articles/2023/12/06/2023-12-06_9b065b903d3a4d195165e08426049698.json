  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 06 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi on Wednesday said amid the challenging global scenario, Pakistan required a dynamic approach to address the threats to regional peace.\nAddressing the inaugural session of Islamabad Conclave 2023 themed ‘Pakistan in a changing world’ organized by Institute of Strategic Studies Islamabad (ISSI), he said Pakistan must consciously rediscover its vision in the wake of super power rivalries and interference of neighbouring states.\nThe president, in this regard, emphasized close liaison among politicians and parliamentarians, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Defence for effective deliberations and policy-making.\nPresident Alvi said Pakistan’s strategic shift from geo-politics to geo-economic and the regional situation in the wake of India’s belligerence needed the policies in line with regional and systemic developments.\nPresident Alvi said the civilized world today had forgotten the principles of morality and was witnessing prevalence of wars waged by powerful against weaker segments.\nThe situation in Gaza, he said, was an alarming sign of the apathy of the world which could not stop the massacre of innocent people including women and children.\nHe regretted that even the gory imagery of Gaza killings could not shake the world’s conscience, terming it a failure of the intellect of mankind.\nThe president recalled that decades ago, the world after several war-related massacres in Europe had arrived at the culmination of peace treaties and bodies like the League of the Nations and the United Nations (UN).\nHowever, he pointed out that now every rule made by the civilized world as a lesson learned after several wars was being undermined.\nDr Alvi said allowing few states the right of veto power was in fact the first failure of mankind to bow before the vested interests.\nWar, he said, was not a solution to resolve any conflict and always resulted in a never-ending vicious cycle of violence.\nHe expressed disappointment over the approach of democratic countries supporting wars and said morality must be the anchor of human thinking.\nHe said the world at the moment direly needed the approach of love, empathy and forgiveness.\nIn Pakistan’s current political scenario, he said, the same spirit of forgiveness and empathy was lacking and added that the nations evolve on the basis of these factors.\nBesides conflicts, he said, the world faced several threats such as skewed development, immigration problems in first world countries as result of the conflicts in third world countries, increasing poverty, artificial intelligence, nuclear weaponization, and environmental changes.\nPresident Alvi stressed the need for adhering to the principles of socio-economic justice among communities by extending them equal opportunities in all fields of life.\nHe said the real progress was linked with a just distribution of wealth, picking up downtrodden and empowering women.\nThe president lauded the contribution of ISSI as a leading think-tank that carried out deliberations on matters of national, regional and international importance.\nDirector General ISSI Ambassador Sohail Mahmood said ISSI was providing a dialogue platform to the research and policy community with an objective to explore the multiple layers of change and the way forward for Pakistan.\nHe said the two-day event would hold sessions on changing regional landscape, evolving regional dynamics, navigating complex geo-politics, accentuating pivot to geo-economics, comprehensive security in the world influx, and Pakistan’s foreign policy in an emerging world order.",
