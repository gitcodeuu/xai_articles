At that time, it was already decided before the elections which way they would go to, so I consider it a problem,” he added.\nHe said as the arrangements were in place, he was hopeful that the caretaker government wouldbe able to give results in a relatively better way.\nThe prime minister said that he endorsed the Election Commission’s denial of the any delay in the polls .\n“They (Election Commission) have to conduct (elections).

As of today, they are in a position to contest elections and they will contets.”\nAbout the disappearances and resurfacing of PTI leaders, the prime minister said such people went into hiding fearing the arrest for their involvement in attacks on state institutions on May 9.\nHe said while in hiding, they would have a second thought to leave PTI or politics which was their personal decision.\nHe said that no evidence of ‘state coercion’ had come to his knowledge, and even none of those people had spoken of ‘state coercion’. Until then, it’s just allegations, he added.\nPrime Minister Kakar disagreed with the view that the decision of May 9 arsons should be left to the people for elections. He also rejected the allegations of not having a level playing field.\nComing to the economic situation, he expressed his satisfaction with his government’s efforts so far to improve the national economy.\n“They will leave the blueprint for the rest of the work to the next government,” he remarked.\nDiscussing the PIA, he rubbished the allegations of any malpractice in the privatisation process and said such conspiratorial assumptions had brought the country to that extent.\nHe said that expert advisors had been appointed for privatization.\n“These are not union level talks.
