We are hardly managing the educational expenses of our children and running household affairs.”.\n“Due to the price hike situation, it has become impossible to buy the new clothes and shoes of my children, so I have decided to flee the market to buy stuff for the occasion,” she said.\nThe festival proves to be a blessing for the shopkeepers, who earn good business by selling festival-related essentials.\n“Christmas is the main festival during this winter season, through which we can earn good profits through selling decorative ornaments, chocolates, flowers, and gift items in bulk,” Abid Ali, a shop owner at F-7 Markaz, said.\nTalking to APP, he said, “We are expecting a good sale on this year’s Christmas, as most people prefer to buy gifts for their loved ones to share the happiness of the festival.”\nThe festival would be marked through different activities ranging from community gatherings to cake-cutting ceremonies, while the main attraction of the Christmas celebrations is the decoration of the Christmas tree to welcome the arrival of Santa Claus, also known as Father Christmas.\nThe youngsters decorate the Christmas tree with different ornaments, including baubles, small bells, painted gold or silver, stars of different shapes and sizes, pine cones, apples, candies, tinsel, and balloons made from glass, metal, wood, and ceramic. An angel and star are often placed at the top of the tree, representing the host of angels.\n“I always get excited to decorate the Christmas tree with different unique ornaments at my office, arrange a cake-cutting ceremony, and exchange gifts besides other celebrations,” Asiya, a government employee, said while talking to APP.\nShe said, “Sharing happiness with others on such occasions gives a sense of joy and contentment, and we should collectively pray for the safety of all the citizens and the progress of our country during our visits to church.”\nIt has also been observed that a number of stalls are being set up outside the Katchi Abadis, where the majority of the Christian community resides. The stall owners have started displaying a variety of decorative ornaments and dresses, which is a source of attraction for youngsters and children.\nChristmas is the occasion when all young and old take a keen interest in decorating Christmas trees and buying Christmas gifts to show their love to their family and friends and celebrate the occasion through distributing gifts among children, singing hymns and prayers, and arranging family gatherings.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
