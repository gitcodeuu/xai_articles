It said that the court couldn’t accept any delay in the conduct of the general elections.\nJustice Sardar Tariq Masood remarked that there was a bit of stability in the country after the announcement of election date. Whether the petitioners didn’t want stability, he asked, adding that announcement of election schedule was not an ordinary issue.\nJustice Athar Minallah remarked that it was not the duty of high court to see the maps, rather it was the job of ECP.
