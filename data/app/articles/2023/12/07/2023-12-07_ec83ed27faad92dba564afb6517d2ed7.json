With the right steps, the ICT sector has the potential to outpace traditional industries, he added.\nForeign investment in startups has already surpassed the $800 million mark, indicating the growing interest of global companies in Pakistan.\nThe government is contemplating the introduction of a standardized test to facilitate graduating students in securing internship opportunities and employment in the industry.\nTo support external investment through venture capital (VC), the government plans to establish a Pakistan Start-ups Fund. Options are under consideration to redirect capital from other sectors, particularly real estate, to the ICT industry by\nincentivizing the private sector.\nThe official further highlighted the rapid growth of the IT sector in Pakistan, with the number of IT companies exceeding 19,000, and the expansion of 4G connectivity across the country.",
