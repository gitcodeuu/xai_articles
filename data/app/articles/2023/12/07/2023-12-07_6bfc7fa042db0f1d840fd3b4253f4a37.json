We may not be able to make any other major achievement during this limited caretaker tenure and mandate. However, we will go all out to develop an effective mechanism against corruption, which hopefully, will be a good start up and a role model for the successive governments,” he stated.\nThe chief minister on this occasion, appreciated the efforts of NAB Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Provincial Anti-corruption Establishment against corruption and assured that his government would stand by NAB for the purpose.\nHe also stressed the need to create awareness among the masses against corruption and change their thinking adding that each and every segment of the society would have to play its role in eradicating the corruption from the society.\nArshad Shah said that equality, transparency, justice and supremacy of merit were the real spirit of a good governance. “Today, we all are here to reiterate our commitment to continue the fight against corruption, ” he concluded.",
