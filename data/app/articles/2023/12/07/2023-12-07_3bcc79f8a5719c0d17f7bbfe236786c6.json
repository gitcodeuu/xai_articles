The event was aimed to highlight and strengthen the cultural and economic ties between Pakistan and Japan.\nIn his remarks, Ambassador Tarar emphasized the enduring friendship between the two nations that transcended geographical proximity. He touched upon the countries’ fruitful collaboration covering trade, technology, academia, tourism, and more.\nHe also spotlighted Pakistan’s treasured Gandhara civilization, which thrived for over a millennium in the region that now comprises northern Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan. This seminal Buddhist center was instrumental in disseminating Buddhist art, architecture and beliefs across Central and East Asia.\nThe envoy said that the remnants of the influential civilization, including thousands of artifacts, archaeological sites, and iconic Buddha statues crafted in Greco-Buddhist style, continue to attract visitors and researchers of Buddhist heritage.\nThe seminar offered attendees an impactful glimpse into Pakistan’s enduring Buddhist history and its intersection with present-day Pakistan-Japan collaboration. It served as a starting point for further cultural and economic exchange between the longstanding partners.",
