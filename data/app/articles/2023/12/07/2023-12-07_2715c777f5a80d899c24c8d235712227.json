  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 07 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday rejected the NAB request for remanding back the Al-Azizia Steel Mills reference to the accountability court, and decided to hear the appeal of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Quaid Nawaz Sharif on merit.\nThe bench comprising Chief Justice Aamer Farooq and Justice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb, which heard the PML-N leader’s appeal his conviction in the reference\nsought arguments from the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on next date of hearing.\nThe former prime minister appeared before the court along with his legal team.\nAt the outset of hearing, Nawaz Sharif’s counsel Amjad Pervaiz said that NAB had filed graft references on the directions of the top court. Separate references were filed with similar allegations against the former prime minister, he said, adding that they had requested only one reference should be prepared against one allegation.\nThe lawyer said that NAB had withdrawn its appeal in the Flagship reference while the IHC had acquitted Nawaz Sharif in the Avenfield property case.\nAmjad Pervaiz said that the court had to view that whether the prosecution had proved its charges in the Al-Azizia Steel Mills reference or not. He said that his client was accused of making assets beyond known sources of income. There were 22 witnesses in the cases, including 13 people who presented the case record, he added, adding that there was no eye witness in the case.\nHe said that Hill Metal Establishment owned by Hussain Nawaz was set up in 2005-2006 in Jaddah. It was set up after selling the Al-Azizia Steel Mills.\nThe lawyer said that Nawaz Sharif never had any connection with the companies.\nAmjad Pervaiz said that JIT head Wajid Zia and investigation officer Mehboob Alam could not prove that Hussain Nawaz was the dependent of Nawaz Sharif.\nMoreover, he said, Nawaz Sharif was not a public office holder from October 12, 1999 to May 2013.\nOn the occasion, the NAB prosecutor objected on the arguments and said that some miscellaneous applications of Nawaz Sharif were pending which should be decided first or they should withdraw them.\nAmjad Pervaiz said that there was an application of defence regarding the videos of judge Arshad Malik, which they would not pursue.\nJustice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb said that if the conduct of the then judge was not good and not based on honesty then it would have impacts on the case. He inquired that why the said judge was terminated.\nThe chief justice remarked that as per the directions of the top court they had two options – either to decide the case on merit after viewing the evidence or remand it back to the trial court.\nAzam Nazir Tarar said that it would be appropriate if the high court take a decision on merit rather than remanding the case back to the trial court. The NAB prosecutor, however, requested the bench to remand back the Al-Azizia Steel Mills case.\nThe court rejected the request of NAB and decided to hear the case itself on merit. The court also accepted the request of defence to withdraw the application against former judge Arshad Malik.\nGiving arguments on case merit, lawyer Amjad Pervaiz said that Hussain Nawaz had sent the money to his father from abroad through the banking channel after four years of setting up Hill Metal Establishment. The amount was also showed in the tax returns in 2017.\nHe said that Nawaz Sharif had no connection with Hill Metal and Al-Azizia Steel Mills and he had never claimed their ownership. Sending money by sons to their father was not a crime, he added.\nThe lawyer said that the JIT had admitted that it didn’t get any proof regarding Nawaz Sharif’s connection with the two companies. He said it was the responsibility of NAB to prove benami transactions.\nThe chief justice said that still NAB had to prove four elements even if it was admitted that the property was owned by Nawaz Sharif. He questioned whether the documents pertaining to receivable salary of Nawaz Sharif from Al-Azizia Steel Mills were verified.\nThe lawyer argued that the accountant who prepared those documents, never appeared before the court to verify the documents. He prayed the court to accept the appeal of his client.\nThe court adjourned further hearing till next Tuesday.",
