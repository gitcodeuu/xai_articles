  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 31 (APP): The website of the Indian Gazette has been hacked by hackers who have displayed the Pakistani movie name Dhai Chaal, a recently released thriller based on real life events, whereas the Indian flag was also replaced with Pakistan’s flag bearing an eagle on it.\nAccording to an X (formerly Twitter) user, SOURCE (@SourceOSINT) who claimed the development on his handle revealed that the official website of Indian Gazette was hacked. He wrote in his post, “I speak\nThe website of The Gazette of Indian Hacked with the message Dhai Chaal Na Waqt Ho Gaya Hai.\n@ShivAroor (an Indian journalist) Watch #MovieDhaiChaal for further details about the Hack. Hack courtesy Bugtis. The revenge of Balochs has started. http://egazette.nic.in”\nHe also mentioned the official website of the Indian Gazette for the X users and masses at large to verify the claim while sharing a screenshot of the website showing the messages of hackers written on it.\nWhen contacted, the Producer of the film Dhai Chaal (The Knight’s Move), Dr Irfan Ashraf said the film was picturised on the real life events that took place during the arrest of Indian Spy Commander Kulbhushan Jadhav that was a great success of the security forces of the country.\nDr Ashraf said the basic theme of the movie is to pay tribute to the sacrifices of locals of Balochistan, to promote the positive impact of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), to expose the Indian-sponsored terrorism in Balochistan, to expose the Indian spy Kulbhushan Jadhav and his terrorist activities in Balochistan, and to show the reality of Pakistan to the world in a soft way.\nThere have been movies like ‘Khuda Ke Liye’, ‘WAAR’, ‘Yalghar’, and others but there was much need for a film project that could focus on digging up the hidden stories of successful and hard-earned achievements of the country’s people and its security forces against the inimical forces, he added.\nDhai Chaal (Knight’s Move), a well-conceived and aptly designed film project by Faisal Production is revolving around an Indian spy, Kulbhushan Jadhav, who was arrested by the law enforcement agencies of Pakistan on March 3, 2016.\nAfter World War II, this is a unique incident that a serving intelligence officer of a country (India) got arrested while spying in another country (Pakistan). The story is based on how Pakistani security forces arrested Kulbhushan Jadhav.\nThe blockbuster thriller “Dhai Chaal” had also bagged huge public acclaim at the box office after the release of the movie whereas the hashtags “#DhaiChaalMovie, #StandWithDrIrfan, #CPEC, and #DhaiChaalinCinema” remained the top trend on X for the past many days.\nThe film Dhai Chaal created a sensation in the Pakistani industry as soon as it was released. A large number of young people reached the theaters on the past Friday, Saturday, and Sunday to watch the movie.\nAfter watching the film, the people said that the way the producer of the film, Dr Irfan Ashraf, has presented the story of Pakistan’s Balochistan province to the world for the first time is unprecedented.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
