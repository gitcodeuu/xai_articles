Amir Paracha, President, of OICCI, highlighted the significance of private sector engagement in achieving Pakistan’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), stating, “Our dialogue at COP28 was not just a conversation, but a commitment to sustainable practices.\nThe private sector plays a pivotal role in driving innovation and solutions for a resilient, low-carbon future. OICCI is dedicated to spearheading this effort and supporting Pakistan’s climate goals.” Earlier during the year, furthering its commitment to climate action, OICCI organized its second Pakistan Climate Conference on November 01, where the urgent need to boost financial efforts for the environment took center stage.\nAbdul Aleem, CE/Secretary General, OICCI, said “By partnering with MOCC at COP28, OICCI reaffirmed its commitment to champion private sector leadership in climate-resilient infrastructure, green energy, and sustainable agriculture.\nThis commitment,” Abdul Aleem said, “is crucial for Pakistan and will help focus the efforts to mitigating climate disasters and empowering the affected communities.” The OICCI is the collective voice of major foreign investors in Pakistan, with over 200 members, from more than 30 countries. OICCI members contribute over one-third of Pakistan’s total tax revenue and are involved in 14 sectors of the economy.\nThey facilitate the transfer of technology and skills and employ a significant number of people.\nAbout a third of OICCI member companies are listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, and many are associates of Global Fortune 500 companies. OICCI members also engage in corporate social responsibility activities benefiting 46 million persons from underprivileged communities.",
