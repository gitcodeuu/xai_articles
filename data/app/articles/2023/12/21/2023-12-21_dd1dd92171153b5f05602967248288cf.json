  "content": "RAWALPINDI, Dec 21 (APP):Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) while conducting eight operations managed to recover 394 tons of chemicals and arrested 10 accused, said an ANF Headquarters spokesman here on Thursday.\nHe informed that ANF in a major operation against the illegal use of industrial chemicals conducted raids in different areas and recovered 394 tons chemicals.\nThe campaign was launched in the context of increasing threats of drug trafficking.\nThe ANF spokesman said that under the supervision of the national and military leadership, a comprehensive anti-smuggling campaign is underway to protect the economic and national interests of Pakistan.\nIndustrial use of controlled chemicals increases domestic production, tax revenue and national exchequer. However illegal use of chemicals used in industry is a constant threat.\nANF monitored the companies using controlled chemicals for 2 to 3 months. Misuse of import of chemicals under the guise of license of the companies was identified.\nANF conducted eight operations against the companies involved in the theft of chemicals. 394 tons of controlled chemicals (Acetone, MEK, Toluene) were seized in the operations.\nMisuse of NOC quota by the companies is the cause of the wastage of national resources.  The most worrisome is the possible loss of the country’s prestige at the international level.\nThe ongoing anti-trafficking campaign represents an important step in protecting the country’s economic interests.\nEfforts from all the stakeholders are needed to combat criminal elements, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
