  "content": "SWABI, Dec 20 (APP): Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq on Wednesday calling the brain drain part of the talent hunt, said those leaving Pakistan for better opportunities would become a strength for the country, which needed to be encouraged.\nThe prime minister, in an interactive session with the students of Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering, Science and Technology, exemplified the Indian nationals who had left their country and returned as an asset to contribute to their country.\nResponding to a question about the measures taken by the government to stop the brain drain, he said those leaving the country were not going to vanish rather they would seize better economic opportunities and skills, which should be encouraged.\nHe said after improving their skills and qualifications they would become a valuable product as the world was in search of talent. I consider their journey a part of the talent hunt, he added.\nHe said there was no evidence of any dramatic surge in brain drain in the prevailing circumstances rather it was a continuous process of skilled, semi-skilled, and non-skilled people moving abroad for better economic opportunities.\nHe said the export of human resources was an important component of the country’s GDP.\nTo a question about the arrest of Imran Khan, he said the state had an inherent right to apprehend those who violated the laws. He was arrested under certain laws, not by the PML-N, PPP or JUI, he added.\nHe urged the educated class to also debate their political attitudes besides claiming their right to agitate.\nPrime Minister Kakar called for adopting the “all of us” approach and encouraging qualitative discussions for betterment of the society.\nHe said democracy should morph towards the performing democracy as the performance was the key indicator to judge the success of the democratic system.\nHe said transitional democracies like Pakistan could not turn into settled democracies for not giving due focus on performance.\nTo another question, he said every individual was responsible for defending the ideological frontiers of the nation.\nHe said Islam was not the name of a reactionary movement but a reformist movement that encouraged any type of dialogue that otherwise would impact society negatively.\nResponding to another query, he said no one, including the state could suppress critical thinking, but being a critical thinker did not necessarily require being abusive in conversation.\n“Unfortunately, critical thinkers are not being born. This is the tragedy. I am trying to find my Rousseau and Voltaire of my time,” he remarked.\nAsked about the reasons behind the low ratio of girls’ education, he said the situation would not change unless the people built influences voluntarily and started taking pride in the accomplishments of the girls as well, not merely the boys.\nHe said the change in the society’s attitude was of paramount importance as the government’s intervention alone would not suffice to overcome the situation.\nHe assured that the state of Pakistan did not discriminate based on gender and the challenges of primary and higher education could only be tackled by the state through collaborations at the district and tehsil levels.\nThe prime minister said the academia-industry linkage was crucial for reaping the economic dividends as well as establishing an ecosystem to create opportunities for the graduates and fulfill corporate needs.",
