  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 20 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi and President Ebrahim Raisi of Iran on Wednesday had a telephonic conversation wherein they underscored the need for coordinated efforts by the Islamic countries to bring an end to the ongoing massacre and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\nDuring the telephone conversation that lasted almost 45 minutes, President Alvi voiced deep concern over the dire situation in occupied Palestine including Gaza as a result of ongoing Israeli aggression and occupation.\nHe regretted that despite the deaths of over 19,000 Palestinians including women and children, the UN Security Council has failed to impose a ceasefire and bring an end to the unspeakable Israeli atrocities.\nPresident Alvi reiterated that a just solution to the Palestinian question based on an independent and contiguous Palestinian State with Al-Quds-Al-Sharif as capital was critical for lasting peace in the Middle East.\nThe president reaffirmed Pakistan’s support for all diplomatic initiatives to this end and appreciated Iran’s concerns and initiatives about the ongoing situation.\nHe also appreciated the Iranian leadership for its principled stance on the Jammu and Kashmir dispute and its support for the Palestinian cause.\nPresident Alvi conveyed his heartfelt condolences to the government and people of Iran over the heinous terrorist attack on an Iranian police station in Siestan-Baluchistan on December 15. He expressed Pakistan’s resolve to work with Iran to combat terrorism.\nAs the two leaders discussed bilateral economic cooperation, the president termed the joint inauguration of Mand-Pishin Border Sustenance Marketplace and Gabd-Polan Electricity Transmission Line as tangible developments that would further strengthen bilateral ties between the two brotherly countries.\nThe two leaders agreed that Pakistan and Iran were brotherly Islamic countries, sharing the same culture, religion, and history.\nThey agreed to work together to further improve economic, trade, and cultural relations between the two brotherly countries.",
