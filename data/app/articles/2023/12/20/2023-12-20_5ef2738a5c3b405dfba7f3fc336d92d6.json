So children who are deaf by birth or have trouble hearing due to some disease before development of speech, if not treated on time, can never develop adequate speech abilities which along with deafness is a lifelong disability,” he said.\nHead of the ENT department (PIMS) Prof. Dr Altaf Hussain said, “The two-day programme was funded by the International Medical Relief Agency (IMRA), which is a UK-based charity organisation founded by Dr Haroon Khan in 2001 and providing medical relief worldwide.”\nHe added that blindness cuts us off from things, but deafness cuts us off from people.\nHe said that a cochlear implant is a small electronic device that electrically stimulates the cochlear nerve (nerve for hearing).\nThe implant has external and internal parts. The external part sits behind the ear and picks up sounds with a microphone.\nIt then processes the sound and transmits it to the internal part of the implant, he added.\nDr Hussain said that earlier this year a surgical training course was conducted by the team of ICE in PIMS, for which the cadaveric head specimens were arranged from USA.\nHe said as many as 130 participants got a chance for hands on dissection and learned new surgical techniques from the renowned experts of ENT fraternity who joined from all over the Pakistan, Malaysia and the UK.\nDr Altaf Hussain said along with these workshops, ENT master class by UK based ENT consultants, was held for the first time in Islamabad, in which 15 renowned ENT specialists from UK Germany and Malaysia joined and gave the insights on the newer approach in the field of ENT.\nHe said, “Being a third-world country with limited resources, the majority of parents can not afford expenses, so we requested IMRA to do these procedures here.”\nHe said, “Dr Haroon Khan, Chairman of IMRA, overwhelmingly accepted and assured us to visit PIMS twice a year for such surgeries.”\n“It has also benefited us as we have got the facility, and now we can also start implants provided that the funding would be provided either by the government, charity organisation, or people who are willing to donate for a good cause,” Dr Hussain added.",
