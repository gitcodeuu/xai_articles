  "content": "RAWALPINDI, Dec 25 (APP): Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Syed Asim Munir on Monday said that the nation would have to stand resolute and strong against the country’s enemies who were creating fissures using religious, ethnic and political vulnerabilities.\n“Enemies of Pakistan are hell-bent towards creating fissures using religious, ethnic and political vulnerabilities. We have to stand together and united to rise as a resolute and strong nation,” the Army Chief said while speaking here at the Christ Church, where he joined the Christian community in Christmas celebrations.\nThe congregation welcomed the COAS and thanked him for sharing the festivity. The Army Chief wished Merry Christmas to the entire Christian community in Pakistan.\nGen Asim Munir expressed reverence for the religious community and stressed upon the need for promoting greater interfaith harmony in the society in order to follow the true vision of Quaid-e-Azam of a united and progressive Pakistan.\nHe said,”Islam teaches us the lesson of peace, friendship and encourages interfaith harmony which is the need of the hour.”\nThe COAS stressed upon the importance of having correct perspective, truth and knowledge-based opinions about national issues rather than following rhetoric and propaganda, to address complex challenges and issues.\nThe Army Chief, paying glowing tribute to Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s great vision and leadership on his 147th birthday, quoted his historical remarks made in his speech on August 11, 1947 while addressing the Constituent Assembly: “You are free. You are free to go to your temples. You are free to go to your mosques or to any other places of worship in this State of Pakistan.”\nAt the end, the COAS befittingly acknowledged the contributions and sacrifices made by the entire Christian community of Pakistan in all the fields and domains.",
