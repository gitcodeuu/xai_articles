They called for continued collaboration and innovation to meet sustainable development challenges, both in Pakistan and globally.\nThey were speaking at a panel discussion titled “Harnessing the Private Sector’s Role in Climate Resilient Development” conducted by Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) in collaboration with German Development Cooperation (GIZ) here Friday.\nThe event underscored the critical role of industries in shaping a sustainable future, especially in the light of Pakistan’s National Determined Contributions (NDCs) under the Paris Agreement.\nJoint Executive Director, Sustainable Development Policy Institute, Dr Vaqar Ahmed expressed gratitude for the collaborative efforts of GIZ and the private sector in his opening remarks. He outlined SDPI’s role in research and advocacy with the federation and private partners over the years.

Given the limitations of public budgets, he stressed the indispensable role of the private sector in meeting these ambitious goals. He further said that the strategies employed by the German government, including industrial decarbonisation and investments in sustainable technologies, set a precedent for industries worldwide.\nResearch Fellow SDPI, Dr Khalid Waleed discussed carbon market mechanisms in Pakistan and emphasized the need for a holistic approach incorporating the 4Es: economy, energy, environment and equitable development. He pointed out the importance of understanding the multifaceted nature of carbon credits and the need for coordination between government and private sectors to implement carbon market strategies effectively.\nHead of Initiative, Centre of Excellence in Responsible Business (CERB), Pakistan Business Council, Nazish Shekha representing the Pakistan Business Council, addressed the challenges Pakistani businesses face in transitioning to sustainable models. She emphasized the need for information, data, and investment in climate-friendly technologies.

She highlighted their comprehensive approach, from carbon footprint calculation to implementing circularity in the supply chain.\nCommunications Specialist, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Gregor Stocker-Thamri while moderating the session, said that today, on World International Children’s Day, there’s no better time to discuss climate change and provide the young generation with the future prospects.
