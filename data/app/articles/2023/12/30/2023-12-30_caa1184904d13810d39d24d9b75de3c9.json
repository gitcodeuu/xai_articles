She raised questions regarding the timing of the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation (Amendment) Act brought by Amit Shah and Modi.\nShe observed that the amendment act introduction mere weeks before the Indian Supreme Court’s verdict implied a foreknowledge within the Modi-led government regarding the outcome of the impending ISC decision.\nMushaal emphasized that the concluding year presented the world with two formidable challenges: the situations in Palestine and IIOJK.\nShe underscored the imperative for collaborative efforts among the people of both regions underlining the shared struggle for their self-determination.\nShe noted that the people of Palestine and IIOJK are enduring the barbarism imposed by occupation forces in their quest for the fundamental right of self-determination. Urging the global community to pay attention to the escalating atrocities in these regions, she called for collective action to address the pressing human rights concerns in Palestine and IIOJK.\nMushaal underscored the unity across all segments of society in championing the just cause of Kashmir. She acknowledged the Kashmir diaspora as a valuable asset in the ongoing struggle for the freedom of Kashmir. She highlighted the pivotal role of the Kashmiri diaspora in amplifying awareness globally about the human rights violations in IIOJK perpetrated by India.\nMushaal pointed out that the elimination of peaceful Kashmiri leaders by India on baseless pretexts could drive the youth of Kashmir toward adopting alternative means in their pursuit of freedom.\nShe also voiced deep concerns over India’s decision to ban peaceful Kashmiri political parties. She reiterated Pakistan’s steadfast commitment to the Kashmiri people, affirming that Pakistan would continue providing moral, diplomatic, and political support to the oppressed population of the region. She also advocated for strong measures to uplift the morale of the people of IIOJK.\nMushaal expressed gratitude to all the participants of the consultative session for their invaluable recommendations. She assured them that their insights would be disseminated to relevant stakeholders for consideration and further action.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
