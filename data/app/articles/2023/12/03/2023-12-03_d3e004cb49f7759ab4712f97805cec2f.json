The Indus river needs a voice and we are here to be give that voice. The Indus feeds us and if we do not take care of it, it will not be there to take care of us,” he remarked.\nThis initiative, he said suggested that “we need a minimum indicative investment between US$11 to 17 billion over the next 15 years to mobilize from the public sector, private sector, citizens and communities”.\nHe said Pakistan launched “Recharge Pakistan” that was the first concrete step towards the Living Indus. “This flagship project with an international climate finance of nearly $78 million is central to our efforts in reducing future flooding and drought impacts,” he added.\nThe Recharge Pakistan project under the Living Indus framework will not only benefit millions of our citizens but also serve as a model for climate innovation on a global scale.\nPM Kakar on the occasion also called upon various stakeholders including scholars, architectures, poets, literary people to contribute towards the global efforts of addressing the climate change issue by raising voice in their articles, sermons, addresses and poetry.\nLater, talking to the students of Pakistan’s orphan school KORT Education who won the prestigious Zayed Sustainability Prize here at COP28, the prime minister said the students had made every Pakistani including himself proud as they have done a wonderful job.\nHe said the new generation was very talented and it will make the future of the country, hence they needed proper attention.",
