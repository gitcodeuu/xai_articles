  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 11 (APP): Pakistan on Monday categorically rejected the judgment announced by the Supreme Court of India on the status of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK), terming it “another manifestation of the pliant judiciary under India’s ruling dispensation”.\nForeign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani at a press conference held here at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs termed Jammu and Kashmir an ‘internationally-recognized dispute, which remains on the agenda of the UN Security Council for over seven decades.”.\nJilani said the final disposition of Jammu and Kashmir was to be made in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council Resolutions and as per the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.\n‘India has no right to make unilateral decisions on the status of this disputed territory against the will of the Kashmiri people and Pakistan,” he said.\nThe foreign minister said Pakistan does not acknowledge the supremacy of the Indian Constitution over Jammu and Kashmir.\n“Any process, subservient to the Indian Constitution, carries no legal significance,” he said.\nHe said India cannot abdicate its international obligations on the pretext of domestic legislation and judicial verdicts.\nIndia’s plans to annex IIOJK are bound to fail, he added.\n“The judicial endorsement of India’s unilateral and illegal actions of 5 August 2019 is a travesty of justice, based on distorted historical and legal arguments,” he said.\nFM Jilani said the Indian Supreme Court’s verdict failed to recognize the internationally-recognized disputed nature of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.\n“It further fails to cater to the aspirations of the Kashmiri people, who have already rejected India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019,” he said.\nHe emphasized that restoration of statehood, conduct of State Assembly elections or similar steps cannot serve as a substitute for the grant of the right to self-determination to the Kashmiri people.\n“The judgment cannot distract the international community’s attention from the gross and systematic human rights violations being perpetrated in IIOJK,” he said.\nHe said India’s unilateral and illegal measures since 5 August 2019 had been aimed at changing the demographic structure and political landscape of the IIOJK, in flagrant violation of international law and the relevant UN Security Council Resolutions, especially Resolution 122 (1957).\n“They remain a matter of grave concern for Pakistan as their ultimate goal is to convert the Kashmiris into a disempowered community in their own land,” he said.\nHe said these measures must be rescinded to create an environment for peace and dialogue.\nJilani said Pakistan would continue to extend its full political, diplomatic, and moral support to the people of IIOJK for the realization of their inalienable right to self-determination.",
