The counsel representing Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) requested an extension until next week to submit the response as a copy of the petition had not been provided.\nChief Election Commissioner (CEC), Sikandar Sultan Raja stated that, as per ECP records, a copy had been furnished to PTI.\nThe case’s hearing is postponed until Wednesday, but the lawyer urged for a further adjournment to next week, citing their engagement in intra-party elections.\nThe Election Commission member questioned the procedure for inter-party matters. Subsequently, the lawyer was instructed by the Election Commission to submit the power of attorney.\nPetitioner, Khalid Mehmood Khan, has submitted a plea seeking the removal of the Chairman of Tehreek-e-Insaf from his party position. The argument put forth is that the PTI Chairman, having been penalized in the Tosha Khana case, should be ousted from the role.",
