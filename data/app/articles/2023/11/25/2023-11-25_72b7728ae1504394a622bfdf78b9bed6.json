He said the cultural affinity between the two nations had been celebrated through various events, promoting a better understanding of each other’s traditions, customs, and heritage from time to time.\nHe further mentioned that the positive impact of this friendship extended to humanitarian endeavours as both Saudi Arabia and Pakistan had consistently supported each other in times of need, standing in solidarity during natural disasters and crises. He said this collaborative approach reflected the depth of the fraternal bonds that existed between the two nations.\nAs the friendship agreement enters its eighth decade, Dr. Naif said the leaders of Saudi Arabia and Pakistan continued to express a commitment to further strengthen and diversify their ties. Highlighting a forward-looking vision, he said it included exploring new avenues for cooperation in emerging sectors, reinforcing cultural exchanges, and enhancing people-to-people connections.\nHe said the historic friendship agreement, initiated in 1951, remained a cornerstone of stability, prosperity, and mutual respect between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.
