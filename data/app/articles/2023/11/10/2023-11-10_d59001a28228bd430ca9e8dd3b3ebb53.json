He commended the joint response of the Pakistani nation, army, and security agencies against recent terrorist incidents, highlighting the solidarity of religious scholars in this regard.\nResponding to a question regarding the situation in Palestine, Ashrafi expressed deep concern over the month-long siege of Gaza by the Zionist state of Israel. He detailed the severe humanitarian crisis, including the suspension of essential supplies and communication systems, and reported over 10,000 Palestinian casualties due to ongoing bombings.\nAshrafi urged the United Nations, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, and international human rights organizations to intervene immediately, warning that the conflict’s escalation could have far-reaching global consequences.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
