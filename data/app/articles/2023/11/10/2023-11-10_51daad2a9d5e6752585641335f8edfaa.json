  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 10 (APP): An Accountability Court (AC) on Friday directed the authorities to return the confiscated assets and property owned by Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) Quaid Muhammad Nawaz Sharif in the Toshakhana case.\nAC-I Judge Muhammad Bashir, while hearing the case, ordered the respondents to return 1,650 kanals land in Lahore, bank accounts, property and luxury vehicles, confiscated by them, to the former prime minister.\nThe court took the decision when it was told that Nawaz Sharif had traveled abroad for his medical treatment with the court’s permission.\nThe judge observed that non-bailable arrest warrants against Nawaz Sharif were issued by the court instead of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) chairman.\nHe said that the court had already withdrawn arrest warrants after the former prime minister surrendered before it.\nIt may be mentioned here that the accountability court had declared former prime minister as absconder in October 2020 due to his continuous non-appearance in the Toshakhana case and also ordered to confiscate his property.\nFormer president Asif Ali Zardari and ex-prime minister Sayed Yousaf Raza Gilani was also named in Toshakhana reference filed by NAB. The NAB had alleged the accused of receiving luxury vehicles from Toshakhana during the regime of PPP.",
