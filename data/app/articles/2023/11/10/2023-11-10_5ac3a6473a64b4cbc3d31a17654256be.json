Karachi, in particular, witnessed a complete restoration of peace within eighteen months, he added.\nPPP leader Mian Raza Rabbani drew attention to the surge in terrorist acts in the country and said that the frequency of such activities had increased, resulting in the deaths and injuries of security force jawans.\nHe expressed the view that external forces aimed to destabilize Pakistan. Rabbani said that dialogue and development would ensure peace in the Balochistan province.\nPPPP’s Behra Mand Khan Tangi expressed support for the caretaker government’s decision to urge illegal residents to leave the country, emphasizing the importance of valid documentation for residing and conducting business in Pakistan.\nPTI Senator Dr. Zarqa Suharwardy Taimur criticized the Modi government for alleged atrocities in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir and for propagating against Pakistan.",
