When an institution can’t deliver in the modern form at the desired level, it significantly impacts students’ satisfaction.\n“Change is inevitable, whether you like it or not. Let’s not give in to the fear of possibilities” opined Dr. Asif Ali, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif (MNS) Agricultural University. He said management of the agricultural university was trying to put in two projects in its curriculum including Cacophony and Mosquitoes Surveillance from New Zealand in the next curriculum.\nIt would equip students with state of the art knowledge as how to save potential fields from flies’ attacks by calculating ‘wind beat frequency’ from affected areas, he added.\nRiaz Baloch, Member Punjab Curriculum Board is an educational expert has relatively diverse opinion about imparting modern education in real sense in the curriculums taught in educational institutions of South Punjab.\n“To me, it’s unfortunate that our educational curriculum doesn’t fulfill modern needs of the time” he said, adding that students secure ‘1083 or 1085 out of 1100 numbers in F.Sc’ couldn’t resolve an unseen question.\nRiaz Baloch underscored the ‘intriguing role of donor agencies’ in pressurizing the local educational authorities to abstain from introducing the desired content into the curriculum. Nonetheless, the given circumstances, Riaz Baloch took solace in the recently announcement by the government that ‘grading system’ instead of current ‘marking system’ that would enable students to sail confidently through the future.\nProfessor Dr Mazhar Abbas, Chairman of BZU Chemistry department said they update the university’s academic curricula to prepare students for technological advancements that are taking place at breakneck speeds. He said they revise outlines of curriculum yearly basis on direction of Higher Education Commission (HEC). The practice has been going on with full momentum for the past three to four years, he added.\nDr Khizer Abbas, Principal of local Institue of Medical Sciences seconded opinion of Dr Mazhar with saying that the fresh medical courses with updated editions to be added periodically. But of course there’s always a room for improvement in any realms of affairs and the same lies with the educational system, he added.\nEducational institutions were coming across challenges of transition being faced by the modern education methods. It caused resistance to the departure from old-age traditional methods of imparting education. There is also a need for significant technology infrastructure that could ensure equitable access to all students.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
