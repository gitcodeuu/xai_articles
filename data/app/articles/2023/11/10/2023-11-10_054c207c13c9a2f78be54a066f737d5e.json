The OIC Summit has been convened in response to the unprecedented Israeli attacks on Gaza and its environs, which have posed a grave threat to the civilian population and precipitated a humanitarian crisis.\nShe said Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar will participate in the Extraordinary Islamic Summit, while Foreign Minister Jalil Abbas Jilani will join the Council of Foreign Ministers preceding the extraordinary session.\n“Pakistan will continue to play its role to advance international consensus and galvanize efforts for an urgent end to Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people and urgent provision of relief assistance to the people of Gaza,” she said.\nOn the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir, she said India must comply with its international obligations and respect the rights and freedoms of the Kashmiri people who have an inalienable right to self-determination.\n“Pakistan will continue to extend political, diplomatic, and moral support to our Kashmiri brothers and sisters for the just and peaceful settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN Security Council Resolutions,” she said.",
