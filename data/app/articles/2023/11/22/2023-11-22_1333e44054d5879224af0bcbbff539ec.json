OffGrid is a very young platform with an experienced team of dynamic artists who presented their first event to the public.\nThe event was inaugurated by the Federal Minister of Culture Jamal Shah and the central theme of this exhibition was the blend of wilderness and creativity.\nThe exhibition brought Offgrid on the grid as the location was the thalweg of the green Chattar Valley with little connectivity.

Nature’s adaptation, characterized by variability and flexibility, is celebrated as a vibrant palette reflecting its infinite beauty.\nIn her series “Kairos,” Lubna Jehangir explores the opportune time related to divine time, a concept free from the constraints of conventional time. The Off Grid Studio Residency provided her with the perfect moment to realign her mind and heart, restoring a calm rhythm and creating a perpetual trance-like feeling. Her works, showcased here, were crafted during the residency, embodying Mahmoud Darwish’s lines from “Loose one of your Stars,” capturing the mysterious and lucid nature of existence.\nShahzeb’s series, “Alternative Maktab,” portrays a parallel dimension where life restarts with the first winter rain after summer hibernation, giving form to different emotions. The work revolves around the paradoxical connection of inner and outer self, exploring the enigma of one’s own identity. Each image, frame, and colour absorbed in the creative process unveils a tiny part of the mystery that is ‘you.’\nSalma’s work captures the intricate details around her, illuminated by the sun. Observing people, and landscapes, and experiencing the profound silence of nature, her art allows her to embody her role as “the nature gazer.”\nSidra’s “Undulating Waves of Existence” seamlessly blends the surrounding environment with her exploration of surfaces in her residency work. The off-grid setting’s vibrant colours and dynamic movements mirror the ebb and flow of life’s thoughts and events, reflected in her marbling techniques. The undulating waves of water serve as a backdrop for crafting unique images that reflect the diverse rhythms of existence.\nFaiza, using traditional Wasli for miniature art, captures “DIVINE’S SERENITY,” illustrating nature’s interaction with the soul. Her miniature paintings incorporate Sufi elements, symbolically using pigeons to convey Sufi thought. The mesmerizing curves of the Chatter trees inspire her to unfold uncharted concepts of femininity and Sufism.\nAkhtar Iqbal’s “Dance with Life’s Echoes” pays homage to his departed dog through twig-like lines, engaging in a dance with life’s echoes.
