  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 5 (APP): The Islamabad Literature Festival (ILF), a celebration of literature and the arts, came to a close on Sunday, marking the end of a successful and inspirational event.\nThe festival, which began on November 3, brought together authors, readers, and literary enthusiasts for a memorable event of academic exploration and discussion.\nIt provided enriching experiences, engaging conversations, and deep appreciation for the impact of literature on society, and covered book launches, author signings, film screenings, panel discussions, and art exhibitions.\nThe closing ceremony comprised keynote speeches by Senator Sherry Rehman and Anwar Masood. Senator Sherry expressed her appreciation for the revival of the Gandhara Citizens Club and was impressed by the theme.\nReiterating the importance of a sustainable planet she shared: “The planet is under stress, and we need to look at possibilities. We are not responsible for the melting glaciers, heatwaves, or monsoons but this does not translate to a total abjection of responsibility at our homes. No army of consultants will be able to formulate policies or develop projects for us and governments alone can also not do this. Climate successes are collaborations, and we all need to play our part in doing so.”\nPoet and critic, Anwar Masood highlighted the importance of literature for a civilized society and a brighter future. “In times of unpredictability, poetry has long been a source of solace for individuals. With arts and literature, we can discover a glimmer of hope and unearth significance in the ordinary moments of everyday life,” he added.\nArshad Saeed Hussain, Managing Director, Oxford University Press (OUP) Pakistan was grateful for the phenomenal response. “Immersed in the compelling narratives and profound discussions of this literary festival, we’ve unravelled the deep ties binding humanity, the planet, and the realms of potential.
