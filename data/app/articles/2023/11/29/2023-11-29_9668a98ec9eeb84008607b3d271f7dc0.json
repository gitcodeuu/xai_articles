For efforts to be effective and meaningful, negotiations and dialogues hold great importance.\nAs the host country for COP 28, the United Arab Emirates has outlined a comprehensive agenda to make this conference a pivotal moment in the global fight against climate change.\nCaretaker Federal Minister for Climate Change & Environmental Coordination, Ahmad Irfan Aslam said that such pre-COP events refined our collective negotiating positions.\nHe stressed that our mission was to mainstream climate change in the economically and socially vulnerable sectors of the economy and to steer Pakistan towards climate resilient development.\nThe minister highlighted the commitments made under Paris agreement and initiatives undertaken to deal with the impacts of climate change but also stressed on the fact that a lot was still needed to be done.\nHe further said, “Climate action is not a choice; it’s our shared responsibility and a priority. Together, we can turn the tide of climate change and build a sustainable legacy for generations to come.”\nCEO NDRMF, Bilal Anwar said that in the face of climate challenges, resilience had become our greatest asset.\nThe NDRMF believed in fostering a world where every community was equipped to withstand the impacts of climate change, creating a future of strength and sustainability, he added.\nKey areas of focus in the COP 28 agenda include Loss and Damage, Climate Finance, and the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETP).\nRecognizing Pakistan’s vulnerability to climate change, the dialogue aimed to gather input from diverse stakeholders to frame Pakistan’s agenda effectively.\nThe Ministry of Climate Change & Environmental Coordination highlighted the critical nature of the Pre-COP28 Dialogue, emphasizing the urgency driven by depleting time, resources, and patience in the face of the worsening climate crisis.\nThe success of COP 27 in Sharm El Sheikh offered glimpses of hope, particularly in the realms of climate justice and finance for addressing loss and damage.\nThe UAE’s commitment to making COP28 a “COP for all and a COP of action” was underscored, with a focus on integrating private sector stakeholders into discussions alongside government leaders.\nThis year’s COP will witness increased industry participation, particularly from the oil and gas sector and renewable energy stakeholders.\nThe conference will mark the culmination of the first two-year Global Stock take since the Paris Agreement, providing a comprehensive assessment of global progress in mitigating climate change.\nAs Pakistan prepares to actively participate in COP28, the high-level dialogue served as a vital step in framing the national agenda and fostering partnerships for meaningful climate action.",
