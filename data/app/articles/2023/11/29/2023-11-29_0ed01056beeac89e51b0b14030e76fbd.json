It provides individuals, especially women, with the necessary resources to navigate an ever-evolving world.\nShe was addressing the opening ceremony of the two-day international conference at Fatima Jinnah Women’s University, Rawalpindi.\nThe two-day international conference would bring together distinguished guests, scholars, and policymakers to explore the nexus between higher education and women empowerment.\nMushaal Hussein Mullick threw light on the systematic obstacles women had faced in accessing higher education in the past.\nShe said that though some milestone in this regard had been achieved, challenges such as gender bias, cultural norms and economic disparities are still hindering women’s educational access.\nSAPM said that Zainab Alert Response and Recovery Act, 2020; Enforcement of Women’s Property Rights Act 2020; The Anti Rape (Investigation and Trial) Act 2021; and The Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace (Amendment) Act, 2022 are significant legislation enacted by the Government to protect and empower women.\nShe stressed the connection between women’s education and economic progress.\n“Spending on women’s higher education is an investment in the country’s economy, leading to a more diverse and innovative workforce and reduced poverty rates, she added.\nMushaal Mullick highlighted that education goes beyond academic accomplishments to critical thinking, problem-solving, and communication skills which are essential for effective leadership. Women with education are not merely economic contributors but also act as agents for driving social transformation, she further said.\nSharing her personal commitment to gender equality and women’s empowerment, SAPM said that she had initiated a 100-day Action Plan to support human rights and women empowerment.\nShe said the Ministry of Human Rights had initiated work on a National Gender Policy in consultation with all stakeholders to end violence against women.\nShe further said that the Legal Aid and Justice Authority Act, 2020 enacted by the Federal Government provided legal and financial assistance to ensure access to justice to vulnerable groups, including women, in criminal cases.\nShe underscored the need to extend women’s empowerment beyond the classroom to mentorship and supportive networks.\nMushaal said that the establishment of Provincial Commission on Status of Women (PCSW) helplines 1043, KPK Bolo helpline, Sindh Women Development Department Helpline 1094, and Tele Psycho Social Support Services were crucial in combating Gender Based Violence (GBV).\nDescribing the distressing situation in the Indian illegally occupied Kashmir and Palestine, Mushaal Hussein Mullick said that Kashmiri and Palestinian women were facing a complex and challenging reality due to the prolonged land disputes in the region.\nShe said that many women have lost their loved ones, and the militarized environment has exposed them to violence and trauma.\nDespite these challenges, Kashmiri and Palestinian women exhibited resilience by actively participating in their communities and steadfastly facing the brutality of Indian and Israeli forces.\nPraising Ahed Tamimi for her courage in the face of adversity, SAPM said that Kashmiri and Palestinian women were the women of substance and a beacon of hope for women around the World.\nMushaal Hussein Mullick called for a future where every woman had the opportunity to access higher education.\nShe further said that the transformative power of higher education would empower women who would transform the world.",
