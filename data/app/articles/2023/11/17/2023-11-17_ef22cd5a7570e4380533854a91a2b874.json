In the first 10 months, the export volume registered a year-on-year growth of 59.7 percent to 3.92 million units, Xinhua reported.\nThe per vehicle export price has also grown to 137,000 yuan (about 19,100 U.S. dollars) in the first three quarters of 2023 from 85,000 yuan in 2014.\n“In 2001, the export value of China’s automobile industry chain was only 1.56 billion U.S. dollars, taking up a global share of just 0.65 percent. In the first eight months of this year, this figure neared 122 billion dollars, accounting for 5.5 percent of the global total,” Wang noted.\nWith the landing of a series of policies to stabilize the economy and promote consumption, and the gradual recovery of consumer confidence, China’s automobile market will embrace new space of growth, Wang added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
