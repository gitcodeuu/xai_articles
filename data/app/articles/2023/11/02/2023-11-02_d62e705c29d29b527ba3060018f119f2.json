This initiative comes as a result of the expiration of the allotted time for illegal resident individuals.\nIslamabad police officials said a team of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) and the capital police on other day transported the prisoners in two buses from Adiala jail to the border under strict security measures. The remaining prisoners will be shifted to the border in different phases.\nShalimar police has also arrested over two dozen Afghan refugees and the process of their identity verification was underway.\nSimultaneously, awareness messages are being disseminated to raise awareness among illegal foreign residents. Authorities have emphasized the consequences of providing shelter or employment to such individuals, reiterating that legal action will be taken against any parties involved in such activities.\nIt has been emphasized that adhering to Pakistani laws remains the sole option for foreign residents in Pakistan.
