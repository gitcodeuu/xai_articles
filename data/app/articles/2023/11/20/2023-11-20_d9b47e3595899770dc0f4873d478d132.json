Due to political and departmental constraints, the department has not been able to recruit the teachers since 2019. Moreover, over 300 teachers are retiring every month,” he said while talking to APP.\nThe minister said,” “Without enrolling children in schools, it is impossible to increase the literacy rate in the province.”\nHe said the caretaker government had decided to upgrade 150 primary schools to middle in the province, four each in every district.\nTo a question, Qadir Bakhsh said due to the last year’s flood, more than 5,500 schools in the province were destroyed, and only 50 of them had been repaired so far.\n“The international organizations have assured their all-out support to repair the damaged schools,” he added.\nThe minister said the government had decided to establish a model school which would help in the promotion of education in the province.\nAs per official data, about 0.8 million children of school-going age are out of school in the province, and some 1,964 schools have no building.
