The event was attended by eminent members of foreign and civil services, academia, civil society, media, and the diplomatic corps, a news release said.\nDr Waqar Masood Khan lauded the author and co-authors for their contribution to addressing the knowledge gap in this field. In particular, he applauded Dr. Ishrat’s devotion and motivation for the subject. The book’s choice of subjects and focus was also underscored by Dr. Khan, who believed that it would substantially assist experts and practitioners.\nDr Waqar Masood added that the book rightly addressed the convergences and divergences between the three economies, as he termed the 1990s as the turning point for the three economies. He explained that this shift was due to globalization, liberalization, and the end of the Cold War.\nHe highlighted some of the challenges faced by Pakistan and India, such as administrative matters, infrastructure, small industry, and investment.\nDr. Khan addressed the regulatory bodies in all three countries and positively evaluated their functioning. He believed that South Asia had moved past the traditional approach towards economic development and become somewhat predictable.\nDr. Khan recommended building up reserves, which he felt served as the critical component of any economy.\nDG ISSI Ambassador Sohail Mahmood, in his welcome remarks, introducing the author and book, he highlighted Dr. Ishrat’s six decades of distinguished public service and contributions to economic and institutional reforms – including a consistent emphasis on political stability and policy continuity for sustainable long-term development.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood also lauded the author’s direct and accessible writing style, making complex economic issues and policy debates more understandable to readers across a broad spectrum. He noted that given the rich data sets of the three countries contained in the book, it could serve as a solid foundation for further studies on the economic trajectories of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh.\nThe most valuable aspect of the book, according to him, was the chapter dealing with risk factors and “pain points” for the future. He also pointed out that the book made it clear that sound economic management alone did not produce the desired effect and that investing in social and human development was imperative, which would also enhance the dividends manifolds. In conclusion, he described the book as a valuable contribution to the existing literature and a source of thought-provoking ideas on a range of subjects.\nAmbassador Nadeem Riyaz, President of the Institute of Regional Studies (IRS) praised the author for his sound academic work and gave a detailed account of the major subjects covered in the book. These included macroeconomics, balance of payments, remittances, human development, social protection, service deliveries, poverty reduction, digitalisation, labour market, and applications of emerging technologies.\nHe particularly focused on the Book’s extensive conclusions and recommended that Pakistan should concentrate on addressing the instability and unpredictability in the economic realm.\nHe highlighted that all three countries had heavy regulations and administrations, problems with start-ups, and issues of taxation that continue to restrict small and medium enterprises.\nHe commended the author for the valuable effort to sum up the long period of 75 years.\nDr. Idrees Khawaja appreciated the author’s efforts in writing this timely book. He also praised the author for including young co-authors. He gave a summary of the book, explaining that it compared the economic performances of three countries with similar histories and backgrounds. He lauded the author for analyzing the factors behind the divergent economic growth trajectories of these countries.\nDr. Khawaja also shared his own analysis of the book and asked thought-provoking questions about the various themes taken up in the comparative analysis. He also recommended studying the different patterns of foreign assistance for Pakistan that appeared in the 1960s, 1980s and 2000s. In his opinion, the primary reason for the slowed development of Pakistan was due to the practice of ‘rent-seeking’ and corruption.\nDr. Ishrat Husain shared how the book evolved, as the subject was considered essential for understanding the present and projecting the future. The book discussed about the changing times for Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. He noted that Pakistan was once considered a role model for developing countries, while Bangladesh was referred to as a ‘basket case’ and India was struggling with poverty, illiteracy, and other social issues. However, the situation had now significantly changed and India and Bangladesh fared relatively better, while Pakistan was facing challenges.\nDr. Ishrat also dilated on the challenges he faced in finding comparable data from all three countries spanning from 1947 to 2022. He highlighted the “five shocks” that affected Pakistan’s economy — from refugee influx in 1947 to war in Afghanistan; and identified “8 critical success factors”, including the forms of government, the role of women, and urbanization, among others.\nHe also discussed the “Risks and Pain Points” for the next 25 years for the three countries – including addressing climate change; enhancing intra-regional trade; ensuring inclusive growth and reducing inequality; managing urbanization; and tackling institutional decline.\nDr Ishrat concluded by emphasizing the need for improving governance structures to ensure sustained and inclusive economic growth and development.\nThe engaging session was followed by a lively Q&A session. In the end, Ambassador Khalid Mahmood, Chairman of BoG ISSI, presented a vote of thanks expressing gratitude to the speakers for their insightful inputs on the Book.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
