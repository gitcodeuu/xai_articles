  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 27 (APP): A senior Indian diplomat had to leave a Gurdwara in New York after pro-Khalistan Sikhs activists confronted him over his role in the failed Indian state plot to assassinate Sikh leader Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, General Counsel to Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) and spokesperson for the global Khalistan Referendum campaign.\nPro-Khalistan Sikhs confronted Indian diplomat Taranjit Sandhu with questions for his role in the failed plot to assassinate Gurpatwant Singh Pannun.\nHimmat Singh, who led the pro Khalistan Sikhs at Hicksville Gurdwara in New York also accused ambassador Sandhu for India’s role in the assassination of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, who was President of Surrey Gurdwara and the coordinator for the Canadian Chapter of the Khalistan Referendum.\nAgitated by the questioning in the public, diplomat Sandhu aborted his visit and fled the Hicksville Gurdwara in a haste without answering any of the questions raised by the Pro-Khalistan Sikhs.\n“I only wanted answers from ambassador Sandhu as to why India is using violence to stop the global Khalistan Referendum voting,” stated Himmat Singh who heads the East Coast Coordination Committee.\n“American constitution gives US Citizens the right to peacefully question anyone irrespective of their affiliation or position in the Government,” stated Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, SFJ General Counsel who was the target of India’s assassination plot foiled by US intelligence.\n“Despite India’s attempt to assassinate me, Khalistan Referendum Voting will continue and the American Phase is going to start from 28th January 2024 in San Francisco, California,” stated Pannun.\nFour days ago, the US authorities said they thwarted an Indian conspiracy to assassinate pro-Khalistan leader of Sikhs For Justice (SFJ) Gurpatwant Singh Pannun on American soil and issued a warning to India’s government over concerns it was involved in the plot, according to multiple people familiar with the case who spoke to the Financial Times (FT).\nThe FT revealed the intelligence people familiar with the case said the Indian govt was behind the plot to kill Pannun who has been running a worldwide campaign called Khalistan Referendum in which over 1.3 million Sikhs have voted so far.\nThe US informed some allies about the plot following the murder of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh separatist killed in Vancouver in June.\nIn September, Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said there were “credible allegations” linking New Delhi to Nijjar’s fatal shooting.\nThe FT said that one person familiar with the situation said the US protest was issued after Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a high-profile state visit to Washington in June.\nThe FT revealed that separate from the diplomatic warning, US federal prosecutors have filed a sealed indictment against at least one alleged perpetrator of the plot in a New York district court, according to people familiar with the case.\nThe US justice department is debating whether to unseal the indictment and make the allegations public or wait until Canada finishes its investigation into Nijjar’s murder, said the paper.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
