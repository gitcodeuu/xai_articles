A count was conducted, but the house was not in order, leading to the adjournment of the session until Friday.\nEarlier, Pakistan Muslim League’s Saadia Abbassi requested the withdrawal of a resolution passed by the Senate, urging the Supreme Court to reconsider its decision on military court trials.\nDuring a point of order, she termed the resolution’s passage as against the spirit of the constitution and democracy.
