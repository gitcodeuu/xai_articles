Until then, these professionals can be valuable assets for the countries in which they arrive.\nThe COMSTECH Science in Exile Fellowship Program would provide scholarships to displaced and refugee scholars and scientists who have not yet found a safe and long-term host country an opportunity to pursue their studies/research, at institutions/universities of the COMSTECH Consortium of Excellence (CCoE).\nA total of 10 Research Fellowships and 10 Post-doctoral Research Fellowships are being offered for the year 2024 under the program which would be hosted by COMSTECH Consortium of Excellence Member Universities/Research Institutions.\nAbout the eligible nationality, the official of COMSTECH informed that the displaced/refugee from Afghanistan, Palestine, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen are eligible to apply for the program.\nThe maximum age limit for Research Fellowship is 35 years and for Post-Doc Research Fellowship is 45 years. The duration of the fellowship is six months.\nThe minimum degree requirements are M.S/MSc for Research Fellowship and PhD for Post-Doc Research Fellowship in relevant field of study while 10 Research Fellowships and 10 Post-doctoral Research Fellowships are being offered.\nThe areas of research are Agricultural Sciences, Structural, Cell and Molecular Biology, Biological Systems and Organisms, Medical and Health Sciences Incl.

The conflict disrupts their research projects, academic careers, and scientific contributions.\nKeeping this mind, the COMSTECH has taken an initiative to support displaced and refugee scientists to pursue their studies and research without disruption.",
