We have a strong economic and trade relationship. We have strong political relationships between our two countries and we have a strong defense partnership.”\nHe further said, “We consult each other in respect of regional and international issues, not only bilaterally, but also in the context of the United Nations and other international organizations. Besides the development of advanced English language, and in times like studying explorer, which is a large Pakistani diaspora in Britain that acts as a solid bridge between Pakistan and the United Kingdom.”\nThe minister said, “We are grateful to King Charles for his advocacy of environmental sustainability and innovations. His commitment to a greener and more sustainable future is commendable, and this is something which is taking place.”\nHe said Pakistan, which had witnessed massive floods which created a lot of devastation last year, was extremely grateful to the British government for the generous assistance.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
