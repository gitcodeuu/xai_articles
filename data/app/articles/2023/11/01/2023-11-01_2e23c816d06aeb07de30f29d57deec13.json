India’s links to the drug trade and the proliferation of illegal weapons have cast a dark shadow. We must address these concerns and work collaboratively towards a more transparent financial ecosystem.”\nDr Fateh Din B. Mahmood, National Consultant in Cybercrimes and Forensics for the UNODC said, “The underworld’s involvement in drug trafficking is a complex web of cybercrimes and illicit financial transactions. To combat this, international cooperation and robust cybercrime forensics are crucial.”\nDr Zafar Nawaz Jaspal, Head of the QAU’s School of Politics and International Relations said India’s financial activities were under intense scrutiny, and “it is the time to confront the issues head-on. The questions raised by FATF regarding black money demand comprehensive answers, and they impact the stability of the entire South Asian region.”\nKamran Saeed Usmani, Advisor to PM Pakistan for Youth Affairs & President of All Parties Youth Wing, Central Youth President PMLQ said, “We cannot ignore the social and political consequences of India’s involvement in the drug trade and the circulation of illegal weapons. These issues affect the youth and the broader political landscape.”\nBaker Younis, Bureau Chief at Pakistan Almayadeen, Beirut, said the global media has a vital role in shedding light on the implications of India’s actions and the FATF’s inquiries. “It’s our responsibility to ensure these issues are not swept under the rug.”",
