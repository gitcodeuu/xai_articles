All financial institutions need to have climate considerations embedded in their decision-making processes,” said Philip Skinner, MD, GuarantCo.\nLast year’s floods that inundated one-third of the country were a stark reminder that Pakistan is paying a hefty price, not only with lives but also destroyed schools, homes and bridges.\nTo work towards mitigating climate change impacts, the Pakistan Climate Conference 2023 brought together global and local climate change experts, business leaders, policymakers and social change activists under one roof.\nIn his opening address, Paracha said that as a collective of more than 200 multinational corporations in Pakistan, the OICCI launched the Conference last year with a sense of responsibility and accountability.\n“Taking responsibility for our footprint, we are working towards minimizing our environmental mark as much as we can by implementing changes within our own operations and also engaging with other key players in the ecosystem,” he added.\nThe themes for the Conference were in line with the upcoming COP 28 scheduled to be held in UAE by the end of November. These included but were not limited to Climate Resilience and Capacity Building in Vulnerable Communities, Plastic and Waste Management and Emissions Reduction and Green Energy.\nSpeaking on the importance of discourse on climate change impacts, OICCI Secretary General M Abdul Aleem said that the Conference highlighted “initiatives, projects, and campaigns that show how people from different backgrounds, sectors, and countries are here to work together to address the climate crisis.”\nThe 2nd Pakistan Climate Conference 2023 built the dialogues on the foundations laid in first the PCC. The panellists and keynote speakers provided suitable policy directions and shared best practices from leading MNCs in Pakistan, which can help accelerate the nation’s climate-positive journey.\nA large number of people from the business community, trade bodies, academia, NGOs and social sector organizations attended the conference and congratulated OICCI for brining the best global talent to one table and discuss the important issue.\nOICCI member companies, including Chevron, Dawlance, InfraZamin, Standard Chartered Bank, Unilever, BASF, Toyota Indus Motors, Nestle and Abbott were key sponsors of the event.",
