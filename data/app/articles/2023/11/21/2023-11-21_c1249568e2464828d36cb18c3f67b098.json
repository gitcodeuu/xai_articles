Pakistan is also among the countries with the highest burdens of low birth weight babies, with a national average of 22.7%.\nThe high population growth, rapid urbanization, market price inflation, global crises, and socioeconomic impact of COVID-19, compounded by suboptimal feeding and caring practices are driving child wasting in Pakistan.\nDr Nadeem said, “We have deficiencies in supply inflows for turning the tide of this malnutrition in Pakistan 150 million USD per year minimum is required to meet the challenge.”\nHe extended special thanks to Children’s Investment Fund Foundation (CIFF) for support of USD 10 million. “There are certain lessons from history we must be cognizant of; we propose that the best course forward would be sustainability and continuum of policies, political will, donors will, advocacy coupled with inclusive, innovative, integrated government based programming.”\nHe said that in order to reduce and maintain childhood wasting to at least less than 15% by 2025, for Pakistan, as committed in Global Action Plan to prevent and manage child wasting, a change in strategic shift and approach is required from relying only on the treatment of children with severe wasting to a deliberate action to prevent and early detect wasting among children by adopting a systems approach.\nAccordingly, the government of Pakistan has taken some concrete actions to address the wasting agenda, and these include a paradigm shift and remodelling program from treatment-centric to preventive, detective and curative-centric.\nHe said that the government is also working on applying the simplified guidelines for wasting management to increase the coverage and early identification of wasting cases, support in enhancing the local capacity to produce ready-to-use\nTherapeutic Food (RUTF), unlocking the Nutrition Matching Fund in Punjab and Sindh, and including wasting management in the Conditional Cash Transfer program for the poorest of the poor under BISP Nashonuma Programme.\nHe said that the government of Pakistan is committed to further strengthening the implementation and monitoring of the strategic shift from treatment to prevention of malnutrition, thereby bringing down the caseload of wasting children.\nAccordingly, necessary additional funding will be allocated that will be channelled towards strengthening the prevention, early detection, and management of wasting, including the local procurement of RUTF.",
