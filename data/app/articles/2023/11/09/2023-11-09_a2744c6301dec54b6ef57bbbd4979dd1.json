To move forward collectively with a positive state of mind, he said, showing collective responsibility was the need of the hour.\nThe PM said that he was the minister in charge of 29 departments for 6 months and not a single financial scandal of any kind occurred during that time.\nHe said that the government would utilize every single penny of tax money for the welfare of its people. “Every penny of the state exchequer is being spent with a sense of responsibility”, he said.\nHe said that he did not believe in issuing empty statements or making hallowed announcements.\nReferring to the reforms undertaken by his government, the PM said, “Under the reform process, important decisions were made to improve the overall performance of the government institutions and departments, including bureaucracy, forests, food and electricity department, education, health and other state-owned institutions”.\nHe said that biometric systems were introduced to ensure full attendance of employees at government offices, hospitals, schools and colleges.\nHe said that electricity, flour and other matters were resolved on a priority basis.\nHe said that the government was going to enforce the Special Powers Act in Azad Kashmir which empowers the government to fire or suspend a doctor or teacher if found absent from duty.\nAccess to information, he said, was a fundamental right of every citizen. All government institutions, he said, were duty-bound to provide information to citizens.\nThe visiting delegation, on this occasion, invited Prime Minister Anwar ul Haq to participate in the swearing-in ceremony of the newly elected body of the organization, which he accepted.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
