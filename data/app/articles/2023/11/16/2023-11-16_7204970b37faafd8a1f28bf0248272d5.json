  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 16 (APP):President Dr Arif Alvi on Thursday said Pakistan can overcome it’s challenges relating to political stability if its politicians, executive and the establishment make a joint commitment to address the issues.\nThe president, in an interview with Voice of America (VOA), was responding to a question if the upcoming general polls would bring political stability in the country.\nPresident Alvi expressed confidence that the result of the polls as an outcome of the public opinion would lead to an environment ensuring stability and prosperity of the country.\nDismissing doubts about delay of general election, he said the judiciary, executive and politicians held a unanimity on holding general election on the announced date of February 8.\nHe maintained that the provision of level-playing field to all political parties was the mutual responsibility of the government and the Election Commission of Pakistan.\n“The government has already given assurance about providing level-playing field to all parties,” he said, adding that the nation had full trust in the government’s commitment in this regard.\nPresident Alvi said that through his letter, he invoked the government’s attention towards the apprehensions of Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI).\nTo a query, the president said the Constitution did not allow the President to take a ‘practical’ action to ensure the transparency of an election. “The President has no other way but to bring such issues to the notice of the government,” he said.\nHe said though the office of the President did not have an administrative authority, however the points raised by it held a significant value.\n“There could be many expectations [from me to act in a particular way], but I will not take any unconstitutional step,” he said.\nThe president said he was not the spokesperson of any party, but of all Pakistanis. “However, I will continue to identify and point out whenever see any issue.”\nTo a question, the president said he never showed negligence with respect to the date of general election.\nAlvi appreciated the Supreme Court of Pakistan on demonstrating unanimity over the election date.\nHe said the case relating to the contesting of election by PTI Chairman Imran Khan was sub-judice and added that he had full confidence in the judiciary.\nTo another question, President Alvi explained that he did not believe in politics of violence and therefore condemned the incidents of 9th May. “Also, the governments should not create such a situation which may lead to violence,” he added.\nHe said he would not like to comment on the cases of the civilians involved in 9th May incidents which were pending with the military courts.\nAsked if he would take an oath from Nawaz Sharif in case he was elected as prime minister, the president said he would comply with the constitutional requirements in this regard.\nHe said completion of President’s constitutional term was the sign of stability of the process.\nOn expulsion of illegal Afghan refugees, he endorsed the government’s decision, stating that the country’s economy could no more afford to bear their burden.\nHe said any review on the decision regarding the illegal foreigners rested with the Apex Committee.\nAlvi said the interim Afghan government failed to control the cross-border infiltration despite evidence provided to them and no action was taken against the Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan.\nHe said there was no communication gap between Islamabad and Kabul, and urged the Afghan administration to take practical steps in this regard.\nOn the Palestine issue, the president said Pakistan since its independence had been supporting the Palestinians and effectively raised the current Gaza situation at all international forums.\nHe reiterated that the resolution of the Palestine issue lied only in a two-state solution.",
