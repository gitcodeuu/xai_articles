Every student is dear to me like my own children, and my ears were eager to learn about their success in the world as a father is keen.”\n“To the capable children of my nation who were facing the darkness of poverty, I pledged as their servant that I will spread the light of progress by equipping them with education and skills,” he said adding, “With the help of Allah and hard work of authorities concerned, who did everything to keep this light ablaze, this promise is fulfilled and as a servant of the nation nothing more than this can make me happy.”",
