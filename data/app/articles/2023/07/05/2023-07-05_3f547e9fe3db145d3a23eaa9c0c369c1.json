Both weather station facilities are also equipped to arrange online trainings for farmers on the latest innovations in agriculture.\nMale and female farmers of selected pilot sites received training on different features of the weather station. Through these stations, farmers will be able to get customized and specific information to their farmland, accurate data and information which will help them in reducing costs related to inputs and taking measures for crop protection.\nThe data will also help Punjab Agriculture Extension 2.0 Project, Water Management Department and Start-Up companies to offer customized, farm-specific services to farmers.
