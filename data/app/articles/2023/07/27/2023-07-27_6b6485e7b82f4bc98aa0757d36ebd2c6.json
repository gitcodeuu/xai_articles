The EDGE programme has demonstrated remarkable success and we are looking forward to continuing this work by empowering a further 1,700 girls in KPK and Baluchistan.”\nDirector of English Programmes British Council, Michael Connolly said, “Thanks to UNICEF we are now able to bring the EDGE programme to some of the most remote and marginalised communities of women and girls in Pakistan. EDGE uses a combination of peer-led and skills-focused approaches, which has proven extremely empowering for girls in this age group [13-19]. EDGE provides safe spaces at community level where girls can discuss, understand and work to address complex issues; including child exploitation and child marriage.”\nAPP/fur-zah",
