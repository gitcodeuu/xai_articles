One should keep a balanced intake of sweet fruit to avoid any other damage to the human body.\nAqil Malik, a student said mango is the favourite fruit of every young and old, everyone eats mango with great passion, according to him, eating mango in excess might harm human health, but its nutrients and rich vitamins heal health.",
