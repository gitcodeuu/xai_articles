The pictures of the martyrs and Pakistani flag should be put up at airports, government buildings, schools, important highways, railway stations and other places.\n“Pakistanis and foreigners should know that as a nation we are grateful to our martyrs,” he said adding visits of people from different walks of life particularly students to these monuments would reignite patriotism.
