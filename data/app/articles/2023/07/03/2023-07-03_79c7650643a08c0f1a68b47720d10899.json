Both the Ministers appreciated the  free bilateral relations while expressing readiness to engage further.\nIn addition, the two side have agreed to conduct the language skill assessment tests for Japanese language in Pakistan to facilitate movement of the skilled workforce.\nFM Bilawal said the two sides also identified import of young Pakistani skilled human resource to Japan and their language training to be a prime area of cooperation. “We also deliberated on investments and joint ventures by Japanese enterprises in Pakistan.”\nDuring his visit, he said he would also interact with private sector, local media as well as think-tanks to further broaden our engagement. I believe that both sides need to stay engaged at all levels to further positive dialogue and continue exploring more avenues of cooperation.\nThe foreign minister also invited his Japanese counterpart to visit Pakistan at your convenience to further our discussions.\nHe said Pakistan and Japan were longstanding friends and share a special bond based on deep rooted linkages that go far in history and time.\nThe people of Pakistan carry a deep sentiment of warmth and affection for Japan and the Japanese people.
