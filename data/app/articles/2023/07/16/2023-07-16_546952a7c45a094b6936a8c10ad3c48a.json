About 3 billion dollar loans were given to the powerful families during the PTI’s government, he said, and questioned as to why this huge amount was not spent on the future of youth?\nToshakhana gifts for the country were sold in a shabby manner and efforts were made by Imran Niazi to protect his spouse from criminal cases. “A worst kind of vengeance was unleashed against the opposition and the civil servants.What was the difference between Hitler and Imran Khan? ” he regretted.\nHe observed that nations were harmed with such tactics. “It was a heart wrenching story but now it has become a part of the past,” he added.\nHe said that Nawaz Sharif and he himself had spent 40 years in politics and experienced ordeals for the sake of the motherland.\nNawaz Sharif was accused of Panama papers and given punishment in Iqama charges, he said, adding that PML-N quaid appeared before courts regularly but on the other hand, Imran Niazi was being granted bails.\nThe prime minister referring to minister for finance’s announcement regarding reduction in prices of petroleum products by Rs9 and Rs7.50 per liter, said that it was all possible due to appreciation in the value of rupee against dollar which provided them an opportunity to pass on the relief to the public.\nThe crude oil price in the international market was still high, he added.\nThe prime minister said that it was also IMF’s programme positive aspect which brought stability in the value of rupee.\nIf they had not reached the agreement, the prime minister observed the difference between the value of rupee and dollar could have increased leading to further difficult economic situation.\n“Those people who had conspired against the country, with the grace of Allah Almighty, all their machinations have been buried and their links abroad, including a  recent statement by Israel against Pakistan, all these were failed,” he added.\nAbout IMF’s agreement, he said it was something of ‘sweetmeat’ , and alluded to the economic challenges. But with determination and commitment, they could  stabilize the economy with revolutionary and bold steps, he stressed.\nThe prime minister said with sacrifices and hard work, and the solemn pledge by the government, rich and those people blessed with resources, public servants and politicians, they could change country’s fate.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Governor Punjab Balighur Rehman said that young segments had always been a precious asset for any country, and provision of opportunities to them was must.\nHe advised the youth to always depend upon truthfulness and facts without being beguiled by sensational and misleading statements.\nHe said all these youth programmes were launched during 2013 which targetted the youth and lauded efforts of the prime minister.\n‘Shehbaz’s speed’ had become an international reference for accomplishment of public welfare schemes at rapid speed, he added.\nThe governor further said that numerous information and technology programmes and skills development schemes were launched by the PML-N government which bridged the digital divide and enabled the youth to earn their livelihood with use of laptop scheme.\nSpecial Assistant to PM on Youth Affairs Shaza Fatima Khawaja informed that under the recent programme, more than 100,000 new entrepreneurs were provided with loans, adding in the last five months, more than Rs30 billion loans had been provided to the young people.\nSimilarly, in the agriculture sector, loans were also extended for seed, fertilizer and produce, she added.\nShaza further apprised that under three-tier programme, interest free loans worth Rs500,000 upto Rs7.5 million were being provided.\nShe said the youth loan programme was first initiated by former prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif.",
