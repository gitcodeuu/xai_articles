The PMNH is also providing training to students from various departments,” the DG added.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the PMNH has four divisions namely Botanical Sciences, Earth Sciences, Zoological Sciences, and Public Services.\nThe first three divisions are engaged in the collection, preservation, identification, and research activities related to plants, animals, fossils, rocks, and minerals resources of Pakistan, while the latter is responsible for public education through dioramas, exhibits, lectures, workshop, seminar, posters, and film shows, etc.\nPMNH also provides consultancy and advisory services to public and private sector organizations.\nPMNH scientists work on various projects for the popularization of natural history through research publications, displays, exhibits, and dioramas.",
