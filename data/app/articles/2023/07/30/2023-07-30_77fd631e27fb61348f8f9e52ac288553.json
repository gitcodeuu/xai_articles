For 3.5, 2.5, and 1.5 years programs, the starting admission dates are December 31, 2019, December 31, 2020, and December 31, 2021, with the end date remaining the same as June 30, 2023 for all three programs.\n“Students’ eligibility and enrollment status as defined is validated prior to distribution of laptops and only those students who apply timely through an online portal and fulfill specified criteria are awarded laptops,” the HEC official said.\n“Merit is strictly observed to distribute laptops among students of all degree programs including BS (16 Years), MS/MPhil (18 Years) and PhD.”\nHe said, “The students must have secured 70 percent marks in the semester system and 60 percent marks in the annual system.”\n“CGPA/ GPA to percentage conversion shall be governed by the HEC-defined formula.\nThe top meritorious students against the allocated quota of each department/ program are considered for the award of laptops as per their respective quota (year-wise or semester-wise).”\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has also reiterated that the laptop scheme under the Youth Program had become a creed for the progress of Pakistani youth.\n“The scheme would bring a knowledge revolution and create practical opportunities for online employment,” he said in a tweet on his Twitter handle. “Today I am pleased to know that by taking advantage from this scheme brilliant male and female students were writing exemplary chapters of success.”\nHe remarked that these intelligent students were our asset and they would find him along with them in excelling in different fields of life. “For the youth laptops are a machine but for me it is a mission.”\nSince the government has increased financial allocation for this scheme, it is also distributing laptops purely on merit. The Prime Minister is himself attending the laptop-giving ceremonies across the country to ensure transparency and encourage the brilliant students of the motherland.\n“I believe there should be no hindrance in their journey of gaining education and knowledge and touching the sky in their endeavors by exploring new horizons,” the PM remarked.\nIt has been noticed that over the period mushroom growth of educational institutions had deteriorated the education standard within the country, there is also a dire need for the present and the upcoming governments to ensure quality education keeping in view the international standards.\nAs we are in tough competition with regional as well as international students to capture slots in world-known universities, therefore this sector needs a focused approach to ensuring that our students are also taught our renaissance along with modern knowledge.",
