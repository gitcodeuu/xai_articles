He said preserving and promoting the Buddhist Gandhara heritage was of paramount importance for Pakistan.\nThe key objectives of the symposium include creating awareness about Gandhara and fostering a sense of appreciation for Pakistan’s rich and diverse cultural heritage, both domestically and abroad. Also, it focuses on considering new initiatives that reinforce the country’s cultural diplomacy efforts and help promote tourism, particularly faith tourism.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of the Gandhara civilization is its artistic creativity. The re-discovered cities of the Gandhara civilization exhibit many elements of their well-structured and modern lives through paintings, sculptures, coins, pottery and their relation with Buddhism.\nLater, during Session I of the Gandhara Symposium on the theme ‘Pathways to Peace: Exploring Pakistan’s Rich Buddhist Legacy, the speakers including religious scholars and faith leaders from Malaysia, Thailand, South Korea, Nepal, Sri Lanka and China highlighted that Gandhara has been a major centre for Buddhist learning and education and recommended preserving the Buddhist Gandhara heritage in Pakistan as well as continued efforts for its projection as part of world heritage.\nSession II discussed ‘Gandhara Civilization: Celebrating Pakistan’s Buddhist Heritage.’ The presenters comprised experts, faith leaders and religious scholars who emphasized that Buddhist Gandhara heritage is paramount to Pakistan. Pakistan is blessed with rich culture and is a hub of civilisations.\nThe Punjab and Sindh provinces have landmark historical sites with excellent archaeological research and spiritual tourism opportunities. Pakistan’s Buddhist legacy offers a pathway to peace, harmony and tranquility. The best way to preserve cultural heritage is to share it with the world and allow them to be part of this world.\nThe panelists suggested that the Buddhist Heritage has economic potential and educational attraction. They recommended promoting Gandhara heritage to the world and creating economic opportunities for Pakistan.\nThe speakers stressed that we must try to dispel the misconceptions about Pakistan in the context of security situation and build trust among Buddhist people so that they can come to Pakistan from around the world.\nSession III delved into ways of ‘Promoting Tourism: Creating an Enabling Environment.’ Experts from Pakistan’s tourism industry and think-tanks were invited as speakers.\nThe panelists agreed that efforts need to be put in place to develop the tourist industry of Pakistan on sounder basis that also helps presents a positive image of the country. They suggested that special attention should be given to various tourism-related matters such as visa regimes, film and media, hospitality, culinary, museums, tours and tourist centers to promote the potential of Gandhara tourism in Pakistan.\nLastly, a panel of religious experts, academics, curators, faith leaders and other stakeholders gathered for a Round Table on ‘Gandhara Civilization: Opportunities and Challenges.’ The points stressed during the Round Table included: Pakistan is a safe place for tourism, and this Symposium conveys the requisite message aptly. Pakistan is going to start Gandhara Tourism, and it is ready to collaborate with other countries to enhance B2B and P2P exchanges.\nThe Round Table concluded that the lack of security structure, deficits in awareness and marketing, needed funds for preservation and restoration, unsupervised hotels, underdeveloped roads, tourist safety, and lack of modern tourism infrastructure are a few of the challenges.\nIt was felt that the holding of the Gandhara Symposium 2023 had made the beginning toward raising global awareness about Gandhara, addressing the mentioned challenges, and seizing the immense opportunities before them.",
