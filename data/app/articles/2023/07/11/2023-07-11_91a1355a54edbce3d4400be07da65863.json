Women and girls must be at the heart of all efforts.\nHe said that investing in women’s health and education, addressing gender disparities, and providing economic opportunities are critical steps toward paving a path for a sustainable and prosperous future.\nHe advised that empowering women through employment opportunities can harness their potential, with a rise in their participation in the labour market adding that this can further increase the labour absorption needs that is requiring for a substantial rise in economic growth.\n“It is essential to upscale maternal health and access to family planning which has been painfully slow, hindering our collective ability to create positive change. We also need to challenge societal norms, attitudes, and practices that perpetuate gender discrimination and inequality. By doing so, we can create an enabling environment where everyone, regardless of their gender, can thrive and contribute to the betterment of society,” Dr. Luay Shabaneh further emphasized.\nHe pinpointed that by addressing these disparities and empowering women and girls, the country can unlock immense potential, foster inclusive societies, and work towards a brighter future.\n“The time for action is now. Government, organizations, communities, and individuals must come together to reinforce their commitment towards achieving gender equality, as it is not only a fundamental human right but also a catalyst for sustainable development. Let us embrace the power of gender equality and strive to uplift the voices of women and girls, unlocking infinite possibilities for a brighter and more equitable world,” added Dr. Shabaneh.\nOn this year’s World Population Day, the focus in the country must not be on the numbers but should turn to unleashing the power of gender equality, he said.\n“Gender-based discrimination not only harms individuals directly affected but also undermines the progress and well-being of society as a whole. Women and girls continue to face numerous barriers and inequalities, limiting their opportunities and stifling their potential”, he maintained.\nWorld Population Day is celebrated each year on July 11 to raise awareness about global population issues and promote dialogue on the importance of reproductive health, gender equality, and sustainable development.\nUNFPA is committed to working with the government of Pakistan and other partners to address the challenges and opportunities presented by the country’s growing population.",
