Initiatives like Recharge Pakistan are the need of the hour to rehabilitate the Indus Basin, Pakistan’s lifeline. Through ecosystem-based adaptation and nature-based solutions, this collaboration will help restore the basin’s health, enhance resilience, and safeguard the most vulnerable communities. Today, we are one vital step closer to building climate resilience, protecting biodiversity, and securing a sustainable future for Pakistan.”\nDirector General WWF-Pakistan, Hammad Naqi Khan added, “A focus on green infrastructure and ecosystem-based adaptation is crucial, especially for a country like Pakistan, where the impacts of climate change are manifesting with increasing frequency and severity and deepening the economic crisis. On behalf of my team, I am thankful to the GCF for their trust and acknowledgment, and would like to thank Minister Sherry Rehman for her support in seeing this through. Under her leadership, the Ministry of Climate Change took all possible measures to secure this critical funding. I am confident that in collaboration with our capable partners, we will deliver the impact expected from this critical and far-reaching undertaking.”\nAnnouncing the news on social media, Senator Sherry Rehman, Minister of Climate Change stated, “We worked very hard to convert this GCF funding from loan to grant. After the 2022 megaflood our view was that Pakistan needs grant based climate financing, and are grateful to the GCF for accepting our advice. Rigorous design implementation involved months of consultations with all the provinces. After this stage, implementation now lies with them as the executing partners.”",
