  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 20 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Thursday said that Pakistan was required to boost its IT exports to $25 billion and IT investment to $20 billion within a span of two to three years, as the government had already placed a mechanism to ensure one-window operations to facilitate the investors.\n“This is something doable. This is difficult but not impossible. We have to achieve this target under all circumstances through your support and expertise,” the prime minister said addressing an IT seminar and launching ceremony of multiple IT-related projects here.\nHe told the gathering of diplomats, IT experts, investors, entrepreneurs, professors and students that the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) would sit with them to discuss issues and find out solutions and move forward like a corporate culture.\nHe said Pakistan was rich with immense youth potential with the youngster getting modern skills with each passing day but the export figure hovering around $2.5 billion did not justify the potential – owing to lack of support and archaic procedures.\nThe prime minister cited the example of a neighboring country that had excelled in the field of IT and IT exports, adding that Pakistan was also positioned to claim its space.\nCalling the investors his “masters” he said the government would extend all-out facilities to them through the SIFC as he himself chaired the apex committee and the Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir was also playing his full role.\nHe said the SIFC would focus on boosting investment in agriculture, IT, mining and defence production.\n“This is seriously a one-window operation with the whole of government sitting there and extending facilities to potential investors without any delay. No delay will be tolerated at any cost,” he assured.\nThe prime minister said that the Gulf countries were willing to invest in Pakistan and the country would also benefit from their investment to generate revenue and enhance exports.\nHe urged all the stakeholders to march with unity and do everything in their capacity to change history as “we have expertise and energy to do the wonder.”\nHe said the government would act as a partner and catalyst to provide all kinds of support to the investors.\nMentioning the “wastage of energies” during the last four years of the previous government, the prime minister urged to move forward to change the landscape of history.",
