He strongly condemned the occupation authorities for imposing restrictions in Srinagar to prevent people from paying tributes to these martyrs.\nAPHC leaders Khadim Hussain and Sibt Shabbir Qummi in a joint statement in Srinagar, paying tributes to the July 13 martyrs, said these Kashmiris sacrificed their lives against Dogra oppression and tyranny and made Kashmiris aware of rising up against the tyrants and oppressors of the time.\nThey said July 13 is the memorable day in the history of Jammu and Kashmir when Kashmiris sacrificed against oppression and injustice and urged the Kashmiri people to observe the Kashmir Martyrs’ Day and send a clear message to India by making the strike call given by the All Party Hurriyat Conference a success.\nThe Hurriyet leaders, including Molvi Ghulam Hassa, Dr Musaib, Prof Zubair, High Court Bar Association, Jammu and Kashmir Political Resistance Movement, Jammu Kashmir Justice League Forum and Jammu Kashmir Democratic Movement (JKDM) in their separate statements in Srinagar also paid rich tributes to the Martyrs of 13th July 1931 and others.\nOn the other hand, senior leader of APHC-AJK chapter Ghulam Muhammad Safi, while paying rich tributes to the martyrs of 13 July, 1931, said the gruesome event was a milestone in the history of Kashmir’s peaceful political struggle for basic human rights and freedom from oppression and military occupation,\nAPHC-AJK chapter leaders, Zahid Safi, Manzoor Ahmed Shah and Qazi Imran, paying homage to the martyrs of 13\nJuly 1931, said the Kashmiri people will never forget the sacrifices of their martyrs and will continue to struggle against illegal occupation till freedom from Indian yoke.",
