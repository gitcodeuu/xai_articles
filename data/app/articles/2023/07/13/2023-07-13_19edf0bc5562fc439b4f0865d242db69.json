One of the responsibilities of the media was to educate the viewers but unfortunately Pakistan’s electronic media ignored informative content, she added.\nDr Shazia Sobia Aslam Soomro said PEMRA should issue directives to the media outlets to produce informative programmes.\nAsiya Azeem said images and videos of violent crimes had left a very bad impact on the psyche of the nation.
