The spirit of sacrifice had been embedded in the Kashmiri DNA, he said in a tweet.\nKashmiris on both sides of the Line of Control and world over are observing the Kashmir Martyrs’ Day, today to pay homage to the martyrs of July 13, 1931, who laid their lives to break shackles of Hindu subjugation.\n“While the oppressors may have changed, Kashmiris’ defiance has remained unwavering. It is this firm belief in their destiny and strong conviction in the justness of their cause that continues to blaze the path even in darkness,” the prime minister remarked.",
