  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 21 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said Pakistan has all the ingredients to increase its information technology exports to the tune of $25 billion in two to three years.\n“Investment in the information technology sector can fetch quick rewards and dividends and go a long way in addressing our unemployment problem,” he said in a tweet.\nThe prime minister, who a day earlier attended the national seminar on untapping the IT potential of Pakistan, said the event held under the banner of Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) was a reflection of our collective resolve to make Pakistan an IT-hub.\n“The seminar, attended by all stakeholders from the public & private sectors, laid the groundwork for an IT revolution that the country so desperately needs,” he said.\nHe said the SIFC, which represents the whole-of-the-government approach, will ensure the provision of policy continuity and predictability in the IT, agriculture, mines and minerals and defence production sectors.\n“Governments may come and go but the economic revival plan will be implemented with the same energy and passion,” he said.\nThe IT industry will have all the facilitation it needs to grow under a one-window arrangement.\nIt is now on the industry leaders to make most of the opportunity. I have my full faith in their ability to rise to the occasion.",
