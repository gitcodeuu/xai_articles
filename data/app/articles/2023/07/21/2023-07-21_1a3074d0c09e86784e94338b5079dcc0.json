  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 21 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday strongly condemned the desecration of Holy Quran in Sweden and vowed to launch a campaign to seek a reversal of the decision of allowing the sacrilege of holy books.\nThe prime minister, in a statement, said that from the platform of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), the government would help create a common strategy to get rid of evil.\nHe said the OIC has to play a historic role in representing the sentiments of the Muslim Ummah and to do away with this evil.\nThe prime minister said that he would campaign to reverse the decision to allow the desecration of the Torah, the Bible and the Holy Quran.\nHe said the permission to desecrate the holy books, persons and rituals was not the freedom of expression but rather a way to constantly torment the world.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz said that the sequence of events evidenced that this was not a freedom of expression but part of a political and satanic agenda.\n“The whole world of Islam and Christianity must collectively stop this conspiracy. Satan’s followers are blaspheming the holy book which gave human beings dignity, rights and guidance,” he remarked.\nThe prime minister said that the decision to allow the desecration of the Torah and the Gospel encouraged desecrators.\nThis is the promotion of hatred which is not allowed under international law.\nHe said such attitudes of religious incitement, provocation to terrorism and violence were fatal to world peace.\nThese behaviors are highly abhorrent and condemnable both legally and morally, the prime minister remarked.",
