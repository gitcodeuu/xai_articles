The suicide bomber targeted police officials who were performing prayers in the mosque.\n“What kind of Muslims are these who are attacking mosques? The so-called Muslims who attack mosques are worse than infidels,” said an analyst.\nThe citizens believed that attacking peaceful worshipers was tantamount to attacking humanity as a whole.\nThey said that the memories of attack on Peshawar Police Lines mosque and the desecration of the Holy Qur’an at the hands of the terrorists had not gone away yet, when another mosque was martyred.\n“Terrorists are at the height of hypocrisy. They are the real enemies of our country, nation and religion in the name of Islam and Sharia. May Allah curse the hypocrites and destroy the forces hostile to Islam,” a citizen commented.",
