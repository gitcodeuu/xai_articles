These values remain relevant in the context of today’s geo-politic and geo-economic landscape where we face global competition among major powers.\n“It is, therefore, important for two countries to strengthen our cooperation amidst these challenges and continue to invest in efforts to strengthen mutual understanding and people-to-people between our two countries,” he stressed.\nThe minister expressed the hope that the OIP would be one of the paths to achieve the goal and offered selected OIP alumni to participate in the public diplomacy programmes such as Indonesia-ASEAN cultural scholarship and friends of Indonesia.\nDirector General Bahria University, Islamabad, Rear Admiral Zakaur Rehman, in his welcome remarks, expressed his gratitude to chief guest Dr Teuku Faizasyah for his virtual presence at the OIP’s inaugural session.\nHe commended Ambassador Tugio’s initiative of organizing the OIP which reflected his interest in furthering the fraternal ties between Indonesia and Pakistan through education.\nHe urged the participants to fully benefit from the Indonesian panelists’ discussion on a diverse range of topics to enhance their understanding of emerging Indonesia’s contemporary dynamics.\nIndonesian Ambassador Adam M Tugio, in his remarks, said,” The OIP brings a wealth of Indonesian experiences and similarities to share with the participants.”\nHe said besides the religious and cultural similarities, the OIP would also highlight Indonesia’s great struggle to overcome the successive and multiple enormous challenges, including political and economic crises.\nAmbassador Tugio mentioned that in Pakistan Indonesia was synonymous to its founding father President Sukarno, Palm Oil and Bali. “Indonesia was much more than that because it is also a third largest democracy, a global emerging economy of inclusive growth and a pluralistic society with the largest Muslim population in the world.”\nThe envoy expressed his pleasure that the Pakistani students were among the highest recipients of scholarships in Indonesia in the last three years and added the OIP would hopefully attract more students from Pakistan to study modern Indonesia and in Indonesia as well.\nAt the session-I, Dr. Abdul Gaffar Karim from Gajah Mada University, Yogyakarta, on the topic of “Discourse on Islam and Nationalism in Indonesia” gave an insightful view on how discourse about Islam and nationalism has continued to resonate in modern Indonesia.\nHe discussed the ongoing debate on Islam and nationalism in Indonesia, a country with the world’s largest Muslim population.\n“Despite not being an Islamic state, Indonesia’s 1945 constitution and Pancasila ideology ensure freedom of religion for all faith believers”, added Dr. Gaffar Karim.\nUnderscoring Indonesia’s diversity and pluralism, he further said that balance between Islam and nationalism remained a subject of constant debate.\nThe Online Internship Programme, which spans over six weeks, will have several dedicated sessions to ensure focused and productive engagement between the participants and the speakers on various aspects of Indonesia who join online from Indonesia.\nSession 2 will be held on Thursday (20/08) focusing Indonesia’s journey to democracy.",
