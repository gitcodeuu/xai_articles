He vowed to pay special focus on the less developed areas of the country where the young people could not complete their studies due to lack of resources.\nToday, he said the board meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was going to be held which would hopefully approve the $3 billion stand-by agreement with Pakistan.\n“This is not a matter of pride but an alarming situation that why we always ask our friendly countries and the financial institutions to help us saving from default,” he added.\nNow in any case, he said “we should face the situation and show determination to make serious efforts for the development and prosperity of the country”.\nGiving the example of China, the prime minister said Pakistan could also regain its lost glory by paying special focus in various sectors especially on education.\nHe said China is Pakistan’s best friend that disbursed $5 billion in last three months while Saudi Arabia also sent $2 billion and another $1 billion would be received from UAE in a day or two.\nEarlier, PM Shehbaz Sharif also distributed the scholarships cheques under the newly launched project among the talented and deserving students.\nMinister for Education and Professional Training Rana Tanvir Hussain said the programme was designed in line with the Punjab Education Endowment Fund (PEEF) to provide merit based scholarships to the talented students of various fields including engineering, nursing, agriculture, social sciences and allied health sciences.\nHe said keeping in view the current situation, the government had also decided to include computer coding and constitutional studies in the national curriculum. He said under the leadership of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, all the provinces agreed to the amended curriculum.\nHe said amendment in the national curriculum was need of the hour to provide the students quality education to help them playing their role in socio-economic development of the country.\nFederal Secretary Education Waseem Ajmal informed that under the Pakistan Endowment Fund for Education, the scholarships would be provided to the students through Higher Education Commission (HEC) and National Endowment Scholarships for Talent (NEST).",
