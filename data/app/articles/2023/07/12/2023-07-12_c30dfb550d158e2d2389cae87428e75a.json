Those indulging in such despicable & vile acts as the burning of the Holy Quran in the name of freedom of expression need to be called out publicly,” the prime minister stressed.\nHe said that humanity was better served by a consensus on the resolve to safeguard their shared values of religious tolerance, pluralism and respect for all faiths.\nThe prime minister also expressed gratitude to all the member countries of the UN Human Rights Council that supported the resolution moved by Pakistan on behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).",
