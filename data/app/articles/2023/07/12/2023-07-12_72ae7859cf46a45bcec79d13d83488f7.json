Today, Israel is talking about going to the United Nations. When such a game (played in Pakistan) takes place in these countries, do other states try to protect these criminals,” he questioned.\nJaved Latif observed that foreign funding was given to Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) chief from India and Israel with the aim to destabilize Pakistan.\nHe was of the view the objectives which our enemy could not achieve by  army, it achieved on 9th May by investing in the PTI chairman.\nThe minister said that today some institutions were deliberately expressing pressure on them but in actuality, there was no pressure on them, adding that Parvez Elahi also got relief.\nThe injustice with Nawaz Sharif should be redressed and action should be taken against the elements involved in the conspiracy, he demanded.\nJaved Latif said that senior lawyers and politicians had admitted that injustice had been done to Nawaz Sharif adding that the state was not weak and conspiracies against the country would be foiled in future.\nHe said “It is in the  interest of the country to hold fair and transparent elections on time. The people of Pakistan will decide who will be the next government. If fair and free elections are held, Nawaz Sharif will be elected as Prime Minister for the fourth time”.\n“Today, institutions also agree with the public opinion regarding Nawaz Sharif that if he comes, the era of prosperity will begin in the country in two years. The CPEC project will be completed and its fruits will start coming” he added.\nIn response to a question, Javed Latif said that the way threats were being made and conspiracies hatched, the only solution was timely and fair elections and the thinking of Muslim League-N was clear in that regard.\nIn response to another question, the minster said that arresting or releasing a criminals was not the responsibility of governments, but the work of state institutions.",
