I am sure that they will return with strong knowledge and rich experiences, and their exposure to European universities will also contribute to the development of Pakistan.”\nThe EU Chargé d’Affaires a.i. further added, “The results of the scholarship’s selection demonstrate that Pakistani students are well prepared and that the Pakistani universities provide them with the necessary skills to compete at the global level.”\nHe added that he is particularly pleased to see more students from Pakistan have accessed the Erasmus+ programme.\nThis year 2,835 students from 128 countries were selected for the Erasmus Mundus Joint Master scholarships.\nThe pre-departure event was organized in collaboration with the Higher Education Commission (HEC). It provided an opportunity to the scholarship holders to prepare for their education in Europe and to network amongst their peers and Erasmus+ Alumni. The Erasmus+ Alumni shared their experiences, followed by a question and answer session.\nHigher Education Commission Executive Director Dr Shaista Sohail, representatives from EU Member States and members of the Erasmus+ Alumni Association also attended the event.\nErasmus+ is the EU´s premier programme to support education, training, youth and sport across the world. The first Erasmus+ Programme was launched in 1987, initially for exchanges within Europe only. It was extended beyond Europe´s borders in 2004. It funds programmes, projects, scholarships, and fosters cooperation both within the European Union and globally.\nThe current Erasmus+ programme was launched in March 2021 and brings over 23.2 billion Euro worldwide to support mobility and cooperation in the higher educational sector.",
