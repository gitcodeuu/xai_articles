The project was not only beneficial for the residents of the twin cities but it would also facilitate the people from all over the country in their travel to Kashmir and Northern Areas.\nReferring to the stand-by agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), he said it was all because of the prayers of the people and now the country would resume its journey of development and prosperity.\nIt was not an easy task as the PML-N and its coalition partners put their politics at stake by taking tough economic decisions to save the country from default, he added.\nPakistan, he said, would now stand on its own feet. “We will promote agriculture, information technology and other sectors. Pakistan will not only shed the debt burden but also emerge as a powerful country very soon.”\nHe said the PTI’s Imran Niazi was bent upon ruining the economy as evident from his willful deviation from the IMF agreement. He wanted the country to default, but with the blessings of Almighty and efforts of the coalition government, such an eventuality was averted, the prime minister added.\nPm Shehbaz said not a single corruption scandal had been reported during the current government’s tenure of over one year, rather billions of rupees were saved by reaching big deals such as import of wheat and the agreement of a nuclear power project with China.\nThe cost of the nuclear power project remained the same as agreed with the then prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2018, besides a discount of Rs 30 billion, he added.\nSpeaking about the 9th May incidents, the prime minister said what the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) had done on that day the enemy even could not do.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif also inaugurated the monsoon tree plantation campaign by planting a tree near the project.\nInterior Minister Rana Sanaullah said the prime minister always did the politics of serving the people. He efficiently run the government affairs during his over a year’s tenure as he kept balance among all the coalition partners.\nThe ‘politics of arrogance’ had had been buried forever, he added.\nCapital Development Authority Chairman Noor ul Ameen Mengal said on the prime minister’s direction, the project would be completed in four months and it would cost around Rs 2 billion.\nCurrently, he said, various projects worth Rs 150 billion were in progress in Islamabad, out of them the projects of Rs 100 billion would be completed in a month time.\nPML-N leader Hanif Abbasi saidf the Bahara Kahu flyover would be inaugurated on July 31.\nInformation Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb was also present on the occasion.",
