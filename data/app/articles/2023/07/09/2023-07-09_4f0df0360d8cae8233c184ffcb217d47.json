By actively engaging with their children, observing their activities, and addressing their thoughts and concerns, parents can create a nurturing environment that fosters emotional resilience.\nOpen and supportive conversations at home can help alleviate fears and anxieties that contribute to mental health disorders, she added.\nRegular check-ins with children are essential in monitoring their emotional well-being. Emotions and moods can fluctuate, and by actively communicating and offering support, parents can normalize any fears or anxieties stemming from their environment.\nReinforcing positive aspects of their lives, such as engaging in activities, spending time with loved ones, and pursuing hobbies, can significantly contribute to a healthy mental state.\nHowever, the responsibility to address children’s mental health issues extends beyond the confines of the home.\nGovernment and community efforts are crucial in providing accessible mental health resources and interventions. Prioritizing children’s mental health, alongside physical health, should be a cornerstone of public health policies.\nIn countries facing specific challenges, such as polio eradication, the cooperation of parents becomes paramount.\nIt is essential for parents to understand the implications of neglecting vaccinations, as it not only poses physical health risks but also contributes to mental and emotional distress in children.\nBy prioritizing their children’s health and actively participating in vaccination programs, parents can contribute to their overall well-being and protect them from potential mental health challenges.\nInternal pressures, such as academic performance stress, excessive expectations, and constant comparisons, can significantly impact a child’s mental health.\nCreating a supportive environment that fosters individuality and encourages a balanced approach can help alleviate these pressures. Parents should promote a healthy perspective on achievements and ensure children have opportunities for relaxation and self-care.\nAddressing name-calling, bullying, and fostering a culture of respect within schools and communities is essential. By educating children on the importance of kindness and empathy, we can create inclusive environments where all children feel safe and valued.\nNabhat whose son experienced multiple mental and physical disorders following an accident has shared a mother’s perspective and ordeal while dealing with such child.\nShe said to ensure his well-being, she chose an institute specializing in disability care. Despite their commendable efforts, she hired a nurse, acknowledging that professional support is essential.\nParents must recognize when complex needs surpass their abilities alone, she advised parents.\nIn a nutshell, raising awareness and placing children’s mental health at the forefront is imperative. Parental education programs, guided by experts like Sobia Khateeb, would help empower parents to identify and address potential disorders.\nBy adopting a proactive approach, we can create a supportive environment that nurtures our children’s mental well-being.",
