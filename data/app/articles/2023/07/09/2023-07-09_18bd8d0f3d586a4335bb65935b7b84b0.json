  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday vehemently condemned social media campaign about threats of an assassination attempt on Chief of Army Staff General Asim Munir and expressed the resolve to crush every conspiracy against Pakistan and the state institutions.\nThe prime minister, in a press statement shared by PM Office Media Wing, said that on May 9 (Black Day) similar minds were involved in the conspiracy.\nThe prime minister directed the relevant authorities to take legal action against those involved in such media campaigns inside the country and abroad.\n“It is a clear message to 9th May planners, facilitators and handlers that conspiracy against Pakistan and its institutions will be crushed”, he added.\nHe further termed the vile, malevolent and malicious media campaigns a result of the planning of miscreants, adding the conspirators had again become active against the political and economic stability in the country.\nThe new media campaign was a part and parcel of that abhorrent campaign, which was launched against Shuhada, he maintained.\nThe prime minister observed that the media drive against armed forces and its chief did not fall within the domain of freedom of expression, but it was only a conspiracy, and it was a legal responsibility to eradicate such tendency with full strength.\nHe said the nation would foil such attempts in such a manner as it had frustrated the attempt on May 9 to stir violence and vandalism in the country.\nThe entire nation was standing behind its armed forces and its chief and resolved not to allow the disappointed and panicked elements to create new crises in the country.\nSeparately, on his Twitter handle, the prime minister said that Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan continued to engage in a vile, sinister and malicious campaign against COAS General Syed Asim Munir.\n“His trick of using the proxies to threaten the Army Chief of an assassination attempt has been badly exposed. After his methodically planned attack on the State symbols failed, he is clearly desperate & wants to coerce his way back into power, little knowing that the time of his politics of intimidation, violence & hatred is over,” he added.\nThrough such highly condemnable antics, the prime minister said he (IK) was only exposing himself, the core of which was defined by putting his personal interest (power grab) over everything else.\nThe people of Pakistan and the political parties stood behind their Army Chief and the armed forces like a rock and would thwart any attempt and conspiracy at undermining their prestige, honour and integrity, he added.",
