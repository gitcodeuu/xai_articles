Asif Ali Zardari made his first diplomatic visit to China after assuming the office of President to further strengthen the bilateral relations established by Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Shaheed Benazir Bhutto, she said.\n“He (Asif Ali Zardari) visited China four times in the first year (of his tenure). He visited China several times during his tenure as President. Even after leaving the presidency, he visited China along with Bilawal Bhutto Zardari to enhance the progress of CPEC, which is why the Chinese government named him (Zardari) the founder of CPEC,” Senator Sherry Rehman said.\nShe regretted that the CPEC suffered a slowdown due to the previous incompetent government.\n“However, we are keen to move forward with this game-changer project. Pak-China Friendship Long live,” Senator Rehman added.",
