Prominent stakeholders from Pakistan’s tourism industry will also participate in the Symposium.\nThe Gandhara civilization flourished in the region which is mostly modern-day Pakistan. Situated at the crossroads of ancient trade routes, Gandhara served as a melting pot of diverse cultures and civilizations.\nOne of the most remarkable aspects of the Gandhara civilization was its artistic creativity. The re-discovered cities of the Gandhara civilization exhibited many elements of their well-structured and modern lives through paintings, sculptures, coins, pottery and their relation with Buddhism.\nPreserving and further promoting the Buddhist Gandhara heritage is of paramount importance for Pakistan.  Besides other modes, the digital and social media offer new powerful means for projecting the Buddhist Gandhara heritage in Pakistan to the world.\nThe sacred sites, sculptures, and artifacts of Gandhara are not just relics from the past; they are also as a source of inspiration for the faithful and tourists from different parts of the world.\nOne of the key objectives of the Gandhara Symposium will be to create awareness about Gandhara and foster a sense of appreciation for Pakistan’s rich and diverse cultural heritage, both domestically and abroad.\nAnother important objective of the Gandhara Symposium will also be to consider new initiatives that reinforce Pakistan’s cultural diplomacy efforts and help promote tourism, particularly faith tourism, in Pakistan.\nAgainst this backdrop, the ISSI is proud to partner with the PM Task Force on Gandhara Tourism; the Directorate of Archaeology and Museums, Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; and all other relevant departments and institutions in the convening of the Gandhara Symposium 2023, the press release concluded.",
