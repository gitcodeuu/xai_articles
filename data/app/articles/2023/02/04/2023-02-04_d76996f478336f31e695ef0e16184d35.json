  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 04 (APP): Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Saturday said “Imran Khan’s refusal to participate in all parties conference (APC) is encouraging terrorists by giving the message of division”.\nIn a series of tweets, the federal Minister said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s refusal to participate in the All-Parties Conference was proof of their “negative and fascist thinking”.\n“Imran Khan is not ready to sit with anyone even on matters of national interest. He neither became a part of national unity on the issue of Kashmir, nor does he want to be a part of national unity against terrorism,” Senator Sherry Rehman said.\nThe minister alleged that Imran Khan was somehow trying to give the impression that terrorism was only a problem of the country and the nation, “not of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf”.\nBy not participating in the APC against terrorism, she said, Imran Khan was sending a message to terrorists that “Tehreek-e-Insaf is not against them”, she further held.\n“The aim of his politics is only limited to his personal interests. Political forces forget personal interests in national crises and give a message of solidarity. However, Imran Khan’s politics of division is in the interest of anti-national forces,” Sherry Rehman said.\nThe minister underlined that condemnation was not enough, all political parties had to formulate their own narrative against terrorism.",
