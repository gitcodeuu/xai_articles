  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 14 (APP):A complete shutdown would be observed in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir, tomorrow, against the Hindutva policies being advanced by the Modi-led fascist Indian regime to dislodge Kashmiri people from their lands and properties to push for settler colonialism.\nA call for the strike has been given by the All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), said a press release.\nThe APHC spokesman in a statement issued in Srinagar said Modi’s land grab policy is meant to erase Kashmiris’ identity and its Muslim character besides being a blatant attempt to push settler colonialism in the territory.\nHe urged the Kashmiris to foster unity and not allow the BJP-RSS nexus to snatch away their motherland through despotic measures and convert the Muslim majority into a minority.\nReviving pre-Islamic Hindu civilization in IIOJK is the goal of BJP & RSS, the APHC spokesman said and added that India’s 5 Aug 2019 illegal actions are aimed at fulfilling the same Hindutva agenda of the ruling dispensation.",
