To this, Additional Attorney General Munawar Dogal said that Additional Attorney General Aamer Rehman would give arguments on this matter and prayed the court to adjourn the case.\nThe court questioned why the reforms were not introduced in the system, adding that the number of UCs could be increased through the executive order.
