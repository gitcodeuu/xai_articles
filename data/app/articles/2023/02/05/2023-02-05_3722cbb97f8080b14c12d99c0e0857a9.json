It is my faith that their dreams will soon see the light of day,” the prime minister on his Twitter handle posted while expressing his conviction on Kashmir Solidarity Day.\nIn a related tweet, he said, today the whole of Pakistan came together to express its unflinching solidarity and support to Kashmiri brothers and sisters, who remained undeterred by the oppressive Indian occupation apparatus in the struggle for UN-sanctioned right to self-determination.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
