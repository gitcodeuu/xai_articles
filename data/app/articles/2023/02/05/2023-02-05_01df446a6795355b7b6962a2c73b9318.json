  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 5 (APP):A community event was held at the Consulate General of Pakistan, Dubai on Sunday to observe ‘Kashmir Solidarity Day’.Hassan Afzal Khan, Consul General of Pakistan to Dubai and Northern Emirates presided over the event. People from different walks of life attended the event.\nIn his remarks, Hassan Afzal Khan highlighted that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was one of the oldest items on the agenda of UN Security Council. India’s illegal and unilateral action of August 5, 2019 aimed to alter the internationally recognized disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir and to change the demographic structure of the occupied territory. This action was in clear violation of the UN Charter, relevant UNSC resolutions, international law and 4th Geneva Convention. Numerous reports of the UN, including the two commissioned by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in 2018 and 2019, had re-confirmed ongoing Indian atrocities against the Kashmiri people.\nThe Consul General reaffirmed Pakistan’s position to seek peaceful resolution of Kashmir dispute and reiterated the strong resolve of the government and people of Pakistan to continue extending moral, political and diplomatic support to the Kashmiri brethren. He called upon the international community, the human rights organizations, international media and the civil society to take cognizance of the plight of the Kashmiri people who had been subjected to unabated Indian atrocities.A photo exhibition depicting Indian atrocities in IIOJK was also arranged on the sidelines of event. A short documentary on human rights violations being committed by the Indian occupation forces in IIOJK was also screened during the event. The event concluded with special prayers for the Kashmiri martyrs and success of the struggle.",
