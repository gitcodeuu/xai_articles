He prayed the court to adjourn the case for a couple of days as he also needed time for preparation.\nThe court, however, adjourned the case till Tuesday.\nSheikh Rasheed’s lawyer Sardar Abdul Razzaq requested the court to allow the legal team to meet his client in jail. The family of the accused also wanted to meet him, he said.\nEarlier during the course of proceedings, the Karachi Police’s investigation officer requested the court for the transit remand of the accused.
