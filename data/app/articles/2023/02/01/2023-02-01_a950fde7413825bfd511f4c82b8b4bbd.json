  "content": "In a flurry of tweets, the minister slammed the PTI leadership and said Imran Khan and PTI’s narrative regarding corruption was limited to speeches and publicity only.\nSenator Rehman said, “During his four-year rule, corruption did not decrease but continued to increase.\nBefore the PTI government, Pakistan was ranked 117th in the Corruption Perception Index. During Imran Khan’s rule, Pakistan rose to 120th in 2019, 124th in 2020 and 140th in 2021.”\nThe minister alleged that Pakistan had reached the 140th position in the ranking due to worst tenure of PTI, adding, “Clean and transparent corruption remained rampant in his tenure.”\nSenator Rehman said because of his (Imran Khan) corruption, Pakistan went up 23 places in the corruption index overall. “He created false cases against his opponents while he himself was involved in mega corruption scandals,” Sherry Rehman added.\nShe said, “Now Imran Khan claims that no corruption scandal has surfaced during his tenure.”",
