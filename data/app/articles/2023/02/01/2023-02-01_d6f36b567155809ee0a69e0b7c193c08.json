We are suffering from weak policies of Imran’s regime, he said. The minister said that Pakistan is passing through difficult economic stages due to tough agreements made with IMF by PTI leaders.\nKhawaja Asif said that wave of terrorism had surfaced because Imran Khan could not formulate a clear-cut policy for handling security matters.\nIn reply to a question about TTP groups training, he said with extended support from India, TTP groups pose a threat to peace. We had fought war on terrorism successfully and restored peace in troubled areas, he said adding that the government would take all possible measures to revive economy and control terrorism.",
