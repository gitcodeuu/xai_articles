The purpose of these SOPs was to take preventive measures against forest fire incidents as forest infernos occurred every year due to hot and dry weather, the minister added.\nLast year, there were fire incidents in Margalla, Swat and many other places besides Chilghoza forests in Balochistan, Sherry Rehman said.\nThe minister underlined that forests were the asset and environmental capital, so these measures were indispensable to prevent fire incidents.\nIn order to prevent fire incidents in Margalla, directions have been given to mobilise the control room and helpline, she added.\nThe minister said that strict legal action would be taken against the people involved in fire incidents and the forest mafia",
