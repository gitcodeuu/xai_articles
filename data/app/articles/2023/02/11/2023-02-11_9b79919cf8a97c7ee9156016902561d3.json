  "content": "LAHORE, Feb 11 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said that no doubt, they were passing through hard times, but it was his firm conviction that with collective efforts, sacrifices and hard work, they would overcome these difficulties.\nThe prime minister said all segments of the society, including the elite class, would have to come forward and support the nation with generosity, adding that there was no other way to reach to destination except adherence to these qualities.\nAddressing a ground breaking ceremony of Bab-e-Pakistan and the expansion and infrastructure upgradation of Walton Road, the prime minister said that they had once again gathered at the historic place for which millions of migrating Muslims from the sub-continent had offered historic sacrifices, and strived under the great leadership of Quaid-e-Azam, for the creation of a separate homeland.\nOn their way to the newly created homeland, they came across worst kind of carnage, with thousands of children and women braving the onslaught, he added.\nFederal Minister Sardar Ayaz Sadiq, Caretaker Chief Minister Punjab Mohsin Naqvi, parliamentarians and officials were present during the ceremony.\nReferring to the Walton road, the prime minister said it was the place where thousands of migrants from India took refuge and the locals supported them which renewed the precedent of Ansar-e-Madina.\nThe unique precedent would always be remembered, he added.\nHe observed that the Muslims migrated to a newly created country to get rid of the foreign rulers and with desire to establish a society in which merit, justice and equality would prevail.\nAbout construction of Bab-e-Pakistan, the prime minister said Nawaz Sharif laid its foundation stone during 1991 and then in 1997, when the PML-N came to power work on the project was expedited.\nHe regretted that the project hit snags during 2008 when its contract was awarded during the rule of late Musharraf. About a billion rupees of the nation was buried in its ruins. The contractor was a fraud and lacked experience who wanted to import granite from Italy at a cost of worth Rs900 million, he added.\nThe prime minister opined that it would be a shame for a poor country like Pakistan, where the basic necessities of life like health and education were scant, to use costly imported tiles for the construction of the historic monument\nWith import of tiles, what message they had to give to the outer world! he said, adding that he refused to allow import of such material. The contract was awarded to a person without bidding.\nThe prime minister further said that with such a display of callousness, country’s billions of rupees were wasted.\nHe said such cases also raised questions about the performance of the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) that targeted the innocent people, but did not summon the people involved in such like cases.\n“It were the double standards that had caused harm to Pakistan. The rule of ‘might is right’ must be buried forever by the 220 million people of the country,” he said, adding the country could not move ahead on the path of progress and prosperity unless they collectively resist these tendencies.\nAbout Bab-e-Pakistan, the prime minister said it should be a place for the young generations and the visitors to get themselves aware of the history of Pakistan.\nOn the occasion, Minister for Railways and Aviation Khawaja Saad Rafique said they had gathered at a historical place where the people of the sub-continent had resolved for creation of a new homeland.\nHe said all the development projects across the country had been initiated and accomplished during the PML-N governments.\nHe praised the CBDA for the launch of different projects and observed that with the completion of work, Walton road would also see a vital change.\nWhile Bab-e-Pakistan would offer sports facilities for the common man, he added.\nEarlier, Central Business District Development Authority (CBDA) Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Imran Nadeem presented an overview of the projects.",
