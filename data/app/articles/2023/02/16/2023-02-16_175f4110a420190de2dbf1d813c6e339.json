Studies show, the top academic institutes have closely worked with industry, and public organizations extensively to increase their research productivity.\nAbout the objectives of the workshop, the official informed that the workshop is aimed to identify the following key priorities that universities should consider while defining their Research and Innovation strategy, which could be the roadmap for the following years.\nThese priorities include identifying core competencies and focus areas within Research and Innovation framework, that aligns the university research and innovation portfolio with national needs and global challenges as well as promoting entrepreneurial activities by leveraging upon the university research base, to find innovative, low-cost, indigenous solutions to diverse societal challenges;\nThe workshop will also focus on the transfer of technologies and innovations through prolific collaborations with public and private enterprises – technology diffusion, the official conveyed.\nResource persons from NUST will deliver lectures and share experiences on how to improve the quality of research by investing in human resources, creating an environment conducive to research, and fostering applied research and innovation in academic institutes.\nNUST has become an example to follow for evolving its education, research, and innovation ecosystem.\nNUST worked diligently in developing contemporary facilities, academic curricula, international linkages, competent faculty, and nurturing talents for the nation.\nNUST has formulated its Research and Innovation Excellence Strategy (RISE) 2025 as its five-year strategic initiative that will build upon the momentum gained during the last three decades and is chalked out by horizontal-vertical partitioning of different components of the ecosystem – education, research, and innovation.\nNUST Research and Innovation Strategies for Excellence – NUST RISE 2025, will help in building its achievements and propel NUST to reach new heights in service to the nation, and global community, and meeting diverse challenges for humanity.\nThe workshop has been designed to address the interest of university management, research scholars, officials and policymakers, and enforcement officers, in universities of Least Developed Countries of the OIC.\nThe intended participants can register for physical participation (limited only to Africa) through https://forms.gle/zsoZDsoiTezVLe37A while the participants can register through https://forms.gle/1zF9fNQBTmWa5vFL9 for virtual participation.",
