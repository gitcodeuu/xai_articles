In the ensuing exchange of fire, eight terrorists were killed with a large cache of arms and ammunition, including explosives, recovered.\n“The security forces of Pakistan will continue to thwart such attempts by inimical elements, on the behest of hostile intelligence agencies, to disrupt the hard-earned peace in the province,” the ISPR said.",
