Be it the Covid-19 or any other endemic, terrorism or climate change, the AU initiatives speak volumes about its remarkable performance,” he said.\nWith unity among its member states, he said, the AU had successfully been implementing its vision of ‘Africa solutions for the African problems’ and signing the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement between the Government of Ethiopia and the Tigray People’s Liberation Front in Pretoria last year was a true manifestation of that.\nThe ambassador said the 2023 AU summit was unique as it marked 60 years of the establishment of the union and ten years of the Agenda 2063, which was worked out to ensure inclusive and sustainable development of Africa.\nDean of the African Corps and Moroccan Ambassador Mohammed Karmoune extended gratitude to Jemal Beker for hosting the gathering and also highlighted the importance of promoting fraternity and Pan-Africanism in achieving the aspirations of Africa peoples, and play a significant role in the current global dynamism.",
