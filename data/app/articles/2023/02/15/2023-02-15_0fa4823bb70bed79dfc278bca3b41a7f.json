From 2013 to 2018, the PML-N (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz) government was fully focused on reducing the power circular debt. But due to the poor economic policies of the PTI (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf) government, the circular debt jumped from Rs 1,148 billion in 2018 to Rs 2,467 billion now.\nThe (incumbent) government had revised down the circular debt for FY23 from Rs 855 billion to Rs 336 billion, he added.\nIshaq Dar said due to the reforms being taken by the government, the economy would first get stabilized and then witness rapid growth in the coming years. Resultantly, “income of the people will increase, rupee value will stabilize, and fiscal deficit and current account deficit (CAD) will reduce” and the country’s gross domestic product would grow by 4% in the next fiscal year (2023-24), he added.\nHe said the issue of Letters of Credit (LCs) would be resolved soon which would help increase the exports.\nThe minister said the prime minister had recently announced the historic Rs 2,000 billion Kissan Package, under which Rs 1,000 billion had been released so far. Similarly, he added, under the Youth Loan Scheme, the government would provide Rs 30 billion to the youth during the current year.\nIn the Information Technology sector, the minister said, the government had allowed those earning foreign exchange in Pakistan to keep 35% of their total income in their foreign exchange currencies. The step would help increase the inflow of foreign remittances from the IT sector from $2.5 billion to over $4 billion per year.\nIshaq Dar said Pakistan needed a ‘charter of economy’, for which all the political leaders should get together and vow to play role in strengthening the economy irrespective of their party affiliations. “A future roadmap should be determined to bring the economy out of crisis,” he added.",
