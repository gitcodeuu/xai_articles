Quran clearly says the upper atmospheres have been conquered for human beings”, he added.\nAddressing a gathering after Jumma prayer here Friday afternoon, he stressed for developing the habit of deeper thinking on the part of astrophysisicts and planets life analyzers of the country especially of all universities.\nAlvi suggested an International Astrohysics and Upper Spaces Research and Study Center of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) at Madinah, Saudi Arabia to instill the knowledge of sciences into the youth minds.\nHe urged on ulema to learn modern science along with their enlarged religious education to convey to the younger generation true meaning and worth of human life on planet earth.",
