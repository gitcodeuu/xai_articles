Justice Miangul Hassan remarked that some disqualifications had even far-reaching effects.\nPetitioner’s lawyer Barrister Gohar said that the decision taken by the ECP was not in its mandate. At this, the court remarked how it’s so as it was the responsibility of the ECP to conduct the scrutiny of the nomination papers of the candidates.\nThe court instructed the petitioner’s lawyer to present the references of law and courts’ verdicts related to his case. The court summoned DG (law) ECP on the next hearing and adjourned the case till February 22.",
