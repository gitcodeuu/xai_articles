  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 20 (APP):Chairperson of Peace and Culture Organization, Mushaal Hussein Mullick, lashed out at the international community and the United Nations for adopting a “deaf and dumb approach” towards smouldering Kashmir, which, she said, can’t even hear the heartbreaking pleas of Kashmiri little daughters demanding the release of their fathers illegally detained in Indian jails for years.\nIn a statement on Monday, she said several families from Baramulla district, along with their children, protested at Srinagar’s press colony against the delay in trials of their kin held in several jails for many years.\nShe said the innocent daughters of incarcerated Kashmiri fathers were demanding their release on a fast-track basis with eyes full of tears since they are cognisant of the brutal treatment being meted out by the fascist Indian government against their fathers.\nThe Hurriyat leader stated that the notorious Indian government was brazenly violating the fundamental rights of the Kashmiri people and unleashed state terrorism in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) but the so-called civilized world “sewed their lips” on the world’s worst human rights abuses in the occupied valley.\nMusshaal said a little girl, who did not see her father for the past five years, was crying seeking to meet her jailed father.\nThe chairperson urged that world powers and human rights organisations should listen to the pleas of the innocent souls who wanted the release of their fathers incarcerated in Indian jails in fake politically-motivated cases.\nLike other Kashmiri daughters, she said, Raziyah Sultana had not seen her father for almost nine years and demanded several times to the UN bodies to ensure her father’s release and her meeting but neither the world nor the notorious Modi government paid any attention to her repeated requests.\nMushaal urged the world community and UN bodies to ensure the release of the Kashmiri political prisoners, including Yasin Malik, instantly because they all were put in jails, not for any crime, but only to defuse the flames of the Kashmir freedom struggle.\nShe said the Kashmir dispute was an international dispute, not an internal matter of India, which was recognized by the UN resolutions; hence it should be dealt with and resolved from its historical perspective.\nThe Hurriyat leader stated that The Guardian also exposed the ugly face of India for not releasing the Bucher Papers on IIOJK, wherein General Roy Bucher advised Nehru to take the Kashmir issue to the UN for a peaceful settlement, but in time the annexation was usurped.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the Bucher Papers on Kashmir contained correspondence between Jawaharlal Nehru and General Roy Bucher on Kashmir and the ceasefire.\nShe said the promise of independent statehood to Kashmiris was violated and now the fascist Modi government tried to prevent the breach of the promise made to Kashmiris from coming to light.\nMushaal went on to say that in 1952, Nehru made a statement in Indian Lok Sabha that Kashmiris were free to decide about their future, and India would not impose its will on Kashmiris at the gunpoint.\nHowever, she said, the fascist Indian government did not make the Bucher Papers public because of its possible political and external implications for India, demanding the report should be made public so that the world should know about the reality of the Kashmir dispute.\nThe chairperson urged the world powers to ensure the implementation of the UN resolutions in order to settle the Kashmir dispute.",
