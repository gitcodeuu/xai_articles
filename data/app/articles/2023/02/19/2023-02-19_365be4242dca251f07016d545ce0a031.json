  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 19 (APP): Minister for Federal Education and Professional Trainings Rana Tanveer Hussain Sunday said the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) was struggling for the country’s better future, not for personal benefits.\nTalking to a private media channel, he said under the premiership of Shehbaz Sharif, the Pakistan Democratic Movement was committed to pulling the country out of the swamp where Pakistan Tahreek-e-Insaf (PTI) left us.\n“Imran Khan’s government was imposed upon us by poorly managed general elections in 2018, and it was ousted through a democratic process of a vote of no confidence,” he said.\nBesides the worst economic crises inherited from the Imran’s government, the coalition government was determined to give relief to the people, he added.\nIn response to a question, the minister said Jail Bharo Tehreek should not be limited to workers, Imran Khan should begin by surrendering himself to law instead of seeking pre-arrest bail.\nJust like Imran’s previous unsuccessful political moves, Jail Bharo Tehreek will bite the dust, too, he claimed.",
