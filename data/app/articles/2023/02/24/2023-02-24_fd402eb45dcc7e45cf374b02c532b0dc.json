Where people, women, and children are tortured and their bodies are thrown into a well?”, she wrote.\nThe senator said that the postmortem revealed heart-wrenching facts. “Nothing can undo what the victims and their families have gone through. Heinous violence, killings, and desecration of dead bodies have left us all bowed in shame”, she said.",
