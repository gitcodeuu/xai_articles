He also prayed for high ranks in the paradise for the soldiers martyred during the operation.\nThe prime minister said after the terrorist attack on the Army Public School of Peshawar, the national leadership had formulated a National Action Plan.\nHe said that time Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had invited all the national leaders including those “who did not want to see the matter straightforwardly” however, the decisions were made to revive peace in the country.\nHe told the participants that after the Peshawar attack, the government also invited all the stakeholders but that particular party did not bother to attend the meeting.\n“They still want to resolve the matter on the streets that was highly condemnable,” he remarked.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan currently faced economic challenges and expressed the hope that the situation would improve after the matters with the International Monetary Fund were finalised in near future.\nHe maintained that though the government was compelled to accept strict IMF conditions, the state of Pakistan was above all. Even the government’s coalition parties also put their political interests at stake for the sake of the country and to improve the economic situation.\nHe said that cooperation by the friendly countries was no less than Allah’s blessing, but the foremost priority should be to put our own house in order otherwise no one would come up for help.\nMentioning the killings and arrest of terrorists during different military actions, Prime Minister Shehbaz said the security agencies were making their efforts to ensure the security of citizens.\n“If we act egoistically in this situation too, and compromise over Pakistan, this is not politics,” he commented.\nThe prime minister said for the security of future generations, it was a must for all to realise the sensitivity of the situation.\nHe recalled that Pakistan had sacrificed around 83,000 lives of its soldiers, politicians, and their families, and common citizens to restore the “peace for the world.”",
