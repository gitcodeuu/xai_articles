  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 24 (APP): The incarcerated senior leader of All Parties Hurriyat Conference, Shabbir Ahmed Shah on Friday urged the United Nations Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres, to take cognizance of the grave situation prevailing in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir, where people are being maimed, tortured, arrested and humiliated with impunity by Indian troops.\nAccording to Kashmir Media Service, Shabbir Ahmed Shah in his message from New Delhi’s infamous Tihar jail termed the prevailing situation in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir as extremely critical where arbitrary, detentions, harassment by the Indian forces and snatching of local rights of people by the puppet regime have become a routine matter.\nExpressing serious concern over the upsurge in so-called cordon and search operations by the Indian forces and police personnel in IIOJK, he said the people of the occupied territory have been left at the mercy of over one million Indian troops, paramilitary and police personnel, enjoying unbridled powers under draconian laws to kill, arrest, torture and humiliate anyone with impunity.\nRule of law is a distant dream and human rights have lost their meaning in IIOJK, he added.Shabbir Ahmed Shah also demanded that world human rights organizations play their much-needed role and stop the vicious cycle of violence, abuse and sexual assaults being perpetuated by Indian forces’ personnel against women in the territory.\nReferring to the heart-wrenching mass-rape incidents committed by the Indian forces at Kunanposhpora and Chek Saidpura areas the APHC senior leader said these horrendous incidents of sexual violence continue to bruise the hearts and souls of the Kashmiris who continue to suffer under brutal suppression.\nKunanposhpora is one of the horrible incidents that shook the Kashmir Valley that took place on February 23, 1991.",
