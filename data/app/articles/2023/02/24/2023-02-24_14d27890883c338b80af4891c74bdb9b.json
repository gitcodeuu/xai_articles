Every year on 23 February Kashmiris throughout the world along with the survivors of Kunan Poshpora mass rape in IIOJK organize acts of resistance, remembering, and contemplating in commemoration of the horrific rape and torture of women in twin villagers in district Kupwara, north of Kashmir.\nThe survivors of these atrocities continue to fight for justice and recognition even in the face of overwhelming odds. The fact that they are still seeking legal recourse is a testament to the power of the law as a form of archiving memory, as well as to their own resilience and determination. Speaking on the occasion, Chairperson Peace and Culture Organization Mushaal Hussain Malik highlighted the issues of Kashmiri women and expressed that the women in Kashmir are living under constant fear.\nDespite the threat of being abused or humiliated, they are playing an important role in freedom struggle of Kashmir. There are huge number of Kashmiri women living in refugee camps in Azad Kashmir who have faced worst kind of abuses by Indian occupational forces. We must present those cases at international forums and make joint petitions and educate people.\nInternational University and Political Assistant to Ex-Chief Minister Punjab on Human Rights Ms Urooj Raza Sayyami said that India is illegally using weapons and are violating the human rights in Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir. People are not aware about the situation all because of the silence of Media.\nShe stated that media and international organizations must come forward and full fill their duty. Moreover she stated that it’s the need of the time Pakistan being a party to dispute must come forward and raise voice for Kashmir on international forums and seek opportunities to highlight the violence perpetrated on defenseless Kashmiri’s.\nFormer Minister of Social Welfare and women development AJK Ms Farzana Yaqoob said that Kashmiri women have been facing worst kind of abuses. Kunan Poshpora is world’s worst rape incident and Kashmir is the only part of world where half widows are found. Lecturer, International Relations at Riphah International University Dr. Waleed Rasool stated that all the brutalities that are going on in Jammu and Kashmir is legal according to Indian constitution.\nHe expressed his serious concern about the flaws in international laws and silence of Muslim states particularly the signatories of UN and UDHR.

Everything is available on google but unfortunately actual facts of Kashmir are missing. She further emphasized the need of world’s commitment to end the Indian’s use of sexual violence as a weapon of war, as well as greater accountability for those who have committed such acts.\nAt the conclusion of the working session of the Round Table Conference, an exhaustive factsheet report by Legal Forum for Kashmir titled “The Great Land-Grab: Disempowering People in Occupied Jammu and Kashmir” was also launched.\nThe factsheet report exposes India’s systematic settler colonial program in IIOJK on the lines of Israeli model in Palestine.",
