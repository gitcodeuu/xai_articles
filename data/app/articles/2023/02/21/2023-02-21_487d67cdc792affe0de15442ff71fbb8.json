  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 21 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Tuesday said the coalition government partners had unanimously decided not to contest the upcoming by-elections on vacant seats of the National Assembly.\nNow there would be only the “fascist party” (Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf), which would contest the by-polls and return to the National Assembly, the minister said in a statement.\nShe said the “fascist party” was clueless about its political future. On the one hand, it had approached the courts for the approval of the resignations of its members of the National Assembly and on the other against their acceptance.\nShe questioned why the PTI MNAs had resigned en bloc, besides dissolving the provincial assemblies, if they wanted to contest the by-elections.\nThe “fascist party” seemed to be in an imbroglio as it was trapped among elections, parliament and courts, she added.\nMarriyum said Imran Khan would no more be allowed to create chaos in the country.",
