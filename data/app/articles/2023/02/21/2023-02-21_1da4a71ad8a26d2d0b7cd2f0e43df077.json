Ignite is also developing a startup portal which will help investors to review startups under different sectors or thematic areas, he added.\nAnd eventually, this will help investors do their shopping. Secondly, the startup can also interact with investors and pitch their proposals through that portal. So, it’s a business matchmaking portal which will help startups and investors to build a relationship.\n“The IT & Telecom efforts in the last four years made Pakistan a paradise for investment in the IT & Telecom sector,” the official said.\nHe said eight incubation centers of ignite have created an entrepreneurial vibe in the country which is helping in establishing new startups in almost every sector. The start-ups of the National Incubation Centers established in the country, received an investment of $20 million from various sources last year.\nUnder the National Freelance Training Program initiated and funded by Ministry of IT, as many as 20 training centers were established across the country.\nAs many 8,647 graduates, he said, were trained through International standard IT courses, and these students contributed to the country’s economy by earning $23 million through freelancing after training.\nDuring the year 2022, around 1638 new IT companies got registered with Pakistan Software Export Board, while 761 call centers and 1463 freelancers were also registered with the PSEB.\nHe said the ministry was also establishing specialized incubation centers in agriculture & textile, aerospace technologies and gaming & animation to create more businesses in these areas and boost exports.\nFor the provision of early-stage investment, he said the Ignite was starting an accelerator program so that early-age startups can sustain their businesses.\nIgnite is collaborating with international partners like Plug & Play, orbit, DMZ , 500 global and hub 71 so that the local startup ecosystem can be exposed to international investors.\nHe said that about 33 million people have got themselves registered for freelancing courses under the DG Skills Programs of Ignite, which is 75% more than the target.\nBy June 2022, the freelancers trained with DG Skills have earned a whopping $290 million, adding to the country’s foreign exchange reserve.",
