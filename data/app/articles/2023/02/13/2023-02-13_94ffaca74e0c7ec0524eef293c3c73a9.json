In reporting and informing the general public, radio stations shape public opinion and frame a narrative that can influence domestic and international situations and decision-making processes.\nOn World Radio Day 2023, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) highlighted independent radio as a pillar for conflict prevention and peace-building. That is the reason why support for independent radio has to be viewed as an integral part of peace and stability.\nMeanwhile, Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation organized a grand dialogue among FMs, stream channels, and OTT platforms to discuss the emerging new digital broadcasting ecosystem here at Radio Pakistan headquarters in the federal capital.\nThe dialogue would help shape new opportunities for broadcasters and listeners to cope with the challenging role and scope of the broadcasting industry.\nAs part of this main event, similar events were also held at the provincial headquarters including Lahore, Peshawar, Karachi, Quetta, Muzaffarabad, and Gilgit-Baltistan through Zoom on the same day.\nThe dialogue was aimed at communication, collaboration, cooperation, and critical thinking for the development and effectiveness of broadcasting media in the country.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that radio is an important source of mass communication even in the present era, which remains vital during war, peace, catastrophe, and pandemic.",
