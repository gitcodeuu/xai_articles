They agreed to collaborate and drive meaningful action to build a resilient future for Pakistan.\nIn his opening remarks, the IUCN-Pakistan, Country Representative provided an overview of Pakistan’s climate situation and the significant disasters experienced, particularly in the past year. The devastating floods caused massive destruction in two major provinces: Sindh and Baluchistan.\nCheema underlined that Pakistan’s climate change gender action plan includes a dedicated section on Disaster Risk Reduction, and now was the opportune moment to unite efforts for its practical implementation.

The presentation was rich in detail and comprehensive in scope enabled the participants to collectively analyse and address the challenges and opportunities associated with climate change and disaster risk reduction in Pakistan.\nAs the discussion commenced, it became evident that Pakistan’s geographical and climatic diversity presented a complex array of disaster risks, including floods, earthquakes, droughts, and landslides. Participants emphasized that a proactive approach was imperative, one that focused on pre-emptive measures, early warning systems, and community engagement. It was underscored that any sustainable risk reduction strategy must stem from the grassroots level.\nAli Tauqeer Sheikh, senior expert on climate change informed the participants about flood-hit districts of Balochistan which are still lacking support from the provincial disaster management authority because of lack of funding.\nRepresenting National Disaster Risk Management Fund (NDRMF), Muhammad Fawad Hayat, Head Climate Change highlighted the fact that, “Policy and frameworks needs to be implemented to build resilience.
