  "content": "KARACHI, Aug 23 (APP): Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar called for collective efforts to transform the 250 million nation of Pakistan through collective efforts and take forward the economic journey.\nThe prime minister, addressing the members of the business community here on Tuesday night during his visit, assured them that the government would do the maximum possible for the uplift of the business community as they were the engine of economic growth.\nHe said the $6 trillion natural deposits in Balochistan did not reflect in the condition of the people living there. The nation living on the Indust basin facing food insecurity manifested the collective incompetence.\nThe prime minister said the caretaker government would resolve all of the issues confronting the business community within its capacity.\nHe said the caretaker government had a very limited mandate to assist in elections, run day-to-day governance issues, and follow the international commitment till the new parliament.\nHe said the caretaker setup was becoming a source of peaceful transition.\nCalling Karachi, Karachiites and the business community a “grace of the nation”, the prime minister said Pakistan could not survive sans their contribution.\nPrime Minister Anwaar said the provision of low-cost electricity was inevitable for industrialization as the existing reserves of natural gas were insufficient to support the industry’s needs.\nEmphasising the need for skilled human resources, the prime minister also mentioned the issues of structural challenges and business attitudes facing the goods and services sector.\nHe said it would take some time to transform old business practices into corporate culture.\n“I want to reassure you that we will transform. We will bring optimism. We will do it collectively. Let’s start listening to each other. We will listen to you and you should listen to the state,” he asked the business community.\nRubbishing the notions of brain drain, the prime minister said in the past, India also faced the same issue but the same people returned to their homeland as an asset.\nExemplifying the remarkable distinction achieved by the doctors of Pakistani origin in the United States, he said the overseas Pakistanis always rescued the country whenever it faced the crisis of foreign exchange.\nHe advised businessmen to adopt the best business practices without giving up the larger good for petty interests.\n“Let us discover the Pakistani dream. Let us discover the Paksitani branding,” he remarked.\nHe called for devising a mechanism for tax reforms, low-cost power, foreign exchange issues, and international agreements and assured the government would make all-out efforts to do the doable.\nThe prime minister lauded the services of Saylani Foundation for carrying out the responsibilities of food and human resources which otherwise was the responsibility of the state.\n“If Saylani can do it, why can’t the state of Pakistan do it with huge machinery?” he questioned.",
