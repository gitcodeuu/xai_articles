We have invested in and constructed the Dawood Wind Power Project in Pakistan, as well as the largest super-critical coal-fired power plant, the Port Qasim Coal-fired Power Plant. We have successfully completed the Tarbela Hydropower Project, which is the largest hydroelectric power station in terms of installed capacity in Pakistan, he expressed.\nAs regards the ongoing projects, he said that the company was working on construction of the world’s tallest and largest roller-compacted concrete dam, the Basha Dam project, as well as the 765KV Dasu Transmission Line Project, which represented the highest voltage level in Pakistan’s power infrastructure.\nHe said the company’s contributions to economic development, local employment and fulfillment of social responsibilities has been commended and publicized, receiving praise on official media and various social media platforms within the framework of the CEPC.\nChina Power Hub Power Generation Representative Li Hualin said that the total investment of the energy project, launched in Balochistan by the company, was more than US$ 1.9 billion. He said that the project had generated more than 23 billion kWhs cost effective and clean electricity to national grid, which was an excellent way to contribute economic development and tax revenue for Government of Pakistan.\nSince the beginning of the construction on this project, he said CPHGC has been committed to the goal of creating a “desert oasis” and creating a green and environmentally friendly ecological power plant.\nHe said the project was constructed in accordance with strict environmental standards and had won 74 national and provincial awards, including National Quality Engineering Gold Award, Lu-ban Award and some international awards.\nAt present, he said a total of 868 Pakistani employees were working in CPHGC, of which Balochistan employees accounted for 31 per cent.\nAccording to News and Media Director of APCEA, the association was an influential, self-disciplined organization with more than 200 member Chinese enterprises and organizations based in Pakistan.
