We must never forget that the peace and freedom we enjoy today is due to the ultimate sacrifices rendered by these brave sons of the soil. I salute their families for sacrificing their loved ones for Pakistan,” he added.\nThe prime minister said that it was now their earnest duty that they realised the supreme sacrifices of Shuhada and Ghazis into the prosperity and well-being of each Pakistani.\nHe further said that those who resorted to desecration of monuments of Shuhada, their faces would remain blackened in the history of the country and the proud people of Pakistan would never forget them.\nOn the occasion, the prime minister appreciated the efforts of Chief of Army Staff General Syed Asim Munir and his team and the present federal and provincial governments for the bright and prosperous future of Pakistan.\nThe ISPR, in a press release, said that the prime minister paid a farewell visit to the GHQ.
