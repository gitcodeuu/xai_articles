The people who embarrassed martyrdom in the Bajaur incident were all Ulema, religious scholars and Huffaz and they were all innocent, he maintained.\nShedding light on the Paigham-e-Pakistan, a unanimous doctrine signed by more than 15,000 Ulema and Mashaykh hailing from all segments of the society to maintain religious pluralism across the country, and they had given a unanimous Fatwa (religious decree) that the suicide attacks were Haram (prohibited) in Pakistan, and there was no room for any struggle involving militancy in the country.\nCondemning the indecent incidents of desecration of the Holy Quran in Sweden and Denmark, Ashrafi on behalf of all Ulema and Mashaykh of Pakistan, seconded the stance of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for legislating against these blasphemous acts at the international level.\nHe assured full cooperation to Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Fazl) Chief Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman as it is the biggest religiopolitical party and contributing to the peace, progress and prosperity of the country since day one.\nHe announced to hold countrywide Ulema and Mashaykh conventions for a stable Pakistan in the entire month of August and made it clear that they would not surrender before the terrorism and extremism anyway.\nHe further assured the national security institutions that they were standing by them for the security and sovereignty and the supremacy of Islam through thick and thin.\nAddressing the conference, Allama Arif Hussain Wahidi emphasized that there would be no compromise on Pakistan’s security and sovereignty, which remains the topmost priority for all.\nHe was of the view that the enemies were trying to rob the peace of Pakistan by carrying out such cowardly attacks in the country. To meet these challenges, he said we must express unity in all ranks against the non-state actors playing havoc with the state institutions and the nation.\nCondemning the desecration of the holy Quran, he proposed to the Muslim world to give a strong message to Sweden and Denmark to stop the occurrence of these disgraceful incidents causing interfaith disharmony globally.\nIn addition, he condemned the terrorist attack on the workers’ convention of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Fazl) in Bajaur.\nShaykh Muhammad Hassan Haseeb-ur-Rehman said the OIC’s emergency meeting on the desecration of the Holy Quran in Sweden and Denmark gave a strong message to the world that Muslims could not compromise on their religious sanctities at all costs.\nHe said we must play our role as we have agreed in the Paigham-e-Pakistan to maintain peace and tranquillity in the country.\nConcluding the conference, Dr Qibla Ayaz said we all were on one page and endorsed the narrative of Paigham-e-Pakistan in letter and spirit.\nHe expressed the hope that Ulema and Mashaykh in collaboration with state institutions would make all-out efforts to transform Pakistan into a highly respectable country in the comity of nations and hand over a secure and stable country to the upcoming generations in the future.",
