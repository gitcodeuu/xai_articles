Plan immediate discharges from regulating structures to build capacity for likely heightened or increased flows,” it said.\nThe PCIW was also directed to ensure that flows and discharge data of eastern rivers was updated regularly for necessary planning and preparations.\nThe Met Office and FFD were directed that during the forecasted period share 6-hourly weather forecasts to\nenable timely decision-making and coordinating response.\nMoreover, they would also share 3-hourly updates on river and nullah flows and reservoir levels to facilitate coordinated water management and regulation.\nThe d. Punjab Irrigation Department was also instructed to take all necessary measures to manage water flow and mitigate flood risks.\nThe Provincial Disaster Management Authority (PDMA) Punjab and respective district disaster management authorities (DDMAs) were directed to conduct extensive public awareness campaigns through multiple channels, including TV, broadcast, social, and print media etc., to ensure that vulnerable communities were well-informed about the anticipated flood situation and necessary precautions.\nMoreover, they should also preposition required machinery, equipment, emergency supplies and personnel in high-risk areas, considering the forecasted severity of flooding.\nThe relevant authorities should also proactively maintain nullahs and storm water drains to ensure their proper\nfunctioning and prevent blockages that may exacerbate flooding. They should also ensure immediate stocking of basic commodities, including paramedics and medicine, especially in regions that were likely to get cut-off during flooding.\nHowever, the authorities should also activate early warning systems in flash flood-prone areas to promptly alert\nresidents and facilitate their evacuation to safer locations and also strengthen coordination among all relevant departments and agencies to facilitate the timely sharing of information and resources during emergency\nsituations.\nThe authorities concerned should also ensure widespread circulation of alerts and advisories, especially in local\nlanguages, to raise awareness and sensitize travelers and tourists and local communities in at-risk or vulnerable areas.",
