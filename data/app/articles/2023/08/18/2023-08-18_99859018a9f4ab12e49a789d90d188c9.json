He said SIFC was a dream comes true project as Pakistan was an agriculture country and rich with mineral resources.\nHe said in fact SIFC was not a new idea but it was an old national dream that was going to be materialized now.\n“Day has arrived when with the support of all institutions including Pakistan military leadership, we support, facilitate, encourage, and realize this old national dream.”\nHe said this initiatives was not held by any institution but it was collectively owned by around 250 million people of the country. “We all own it and we will contribute towards it.”\nDuring the meeting, he individually acknowledged the services of all the cabinet members saying “I am very proud that we have got one of the best team”.\nHe hoped that the Almighty Allah would enable them to lead and steer this nation during the interim period.\n“With our utmost duty, may be it is a month, two or three, or three and a half, whatever the allocated time is, we will demonstrate through our actions not by our words,” he added.\nWith regard to the economic situation in the country, the prime minister said he was well aware of the huge economic challenges but with an able team, the government would ensure the financial discipline.\n“We have a sense of sanctity of tax payers’ money.

Pakistan is owned and shared by all ethnicities, all creeds, and all religious background,” he added.\nHe highlighted that the rigidity, be it in any form in the society, would be strongly discouraged.\nHe said rigidity might come in the garb of religion or secularism or in any other form, these extreme attitude would be discourage and would be controlled by the law.\nHe said the minorities would stay protected in this country and any attempt to harm them from a section of marginalized group of people would be responded strictly by the state and the society.\nHe said the miscreants might be from us but we must have to divorce them and keep distant from them.\nHe said Pakistan was created on noble principles and the country was the product of noble idea.\nSpeaking about the incident of May 9, the prime minister explicitly expressed disappointment and discomfort over the sabotage activities happened on the day.\nHe said attack on the military installation was like the country’s immune system was attacked which could lead towards fatality.\n“We do not just condemn it but we also will ensure that justice will be done and whosoever violated laws on those days will be treated according to law and there will not be any favor to anybody”, he added.\nOn Kashmir issue, the prime minister “It was the core issue which could not be ignored. “It lies in our soul, for us Kashmir is eternal.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
