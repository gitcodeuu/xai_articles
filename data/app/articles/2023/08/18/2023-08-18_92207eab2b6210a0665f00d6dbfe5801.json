Throughout these trials, IRC’s steadfast dedication has remained resolute.\nHighlighting the paramount importance of female aid workers, Shabnam Baloch addressed the obstacles they encounter. Given the substantial impact of natural disasters on women and children, she stressed the indispensable role of female aid workers who surmount various hurdles to reach those in need.\nAmong IRC’s emotionally resonant projects, one that is particularly close to Baloch’s heart is the protection of Afghan refugee women. Their plight underscores the organization’s ongoing commitment to safeguarding the most vulnerable.\nShabnam Baloch’s message to the world is compelling: “Every World Humanitarian Day, IRC renews its vow to shield and support those affected by adversity. However, the escalating statistics each year underscore the urgent need for collective action. It’s imperative that we unite, fortify our efforts, and stand as unwavering pillars of support for those in dire need.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
