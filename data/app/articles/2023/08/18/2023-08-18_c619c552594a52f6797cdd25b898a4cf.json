He also sought proposals to set up more weight-measuring stations in the district.\nHe said that 28 such stations had already been registered under the system and more would be brought into the loop. Chandia said that the process of consultations would continue to make it fully operational.\nDistrict Officer Industries Asghar Siddiqui, executive engineer National Highway Authority (NHA) Sohail Zafar, besides officials of Punjab highway patrolling, traffic police, and regional transport Authority attended the meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
