Director Generals (DGs) and other government officials from the line departments of agriculture research, extension, livestockand dairy development, and on-farm water management attended the event.\nRepresentatives and staff from USAID Pakistan, UN Women, FAO, and farmers’ representatives from Khyber and Mohmand districts were also part of the event.\nUnder the said project, FAO, in collaboration with the Government of KP, civil society organizations, the private sector, and all relevant stakeholders, will support 150,000 rural households, including those consisting of women farmers, over a period of four years.\nAt the workshop, the Resilience Index Measurement and Analysis (RIMA) was discussed and validated during different sessions on socio-economic characteristics, food security, agriculture assets, the farming system, marketing enterprises, and value addition analyses. Additionally, the MEAL framework, baseline study objectives, methodology, and sampling techniques were also explained.\nSecretary of Agriculture Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Javed Marwat highlighted the importance of the baseline data validation for project implementation through the experts from allied specialized domains.\nHe emphasized that FAO has not only assisted the agriculture department in introducing, implementing, and promoting climate-smart and innovative agricultural interventions but has also assisted the Provincial Government in drafting the first ever Agriculture Policy for KP, Agriculture Action Plans, KP Food Security and Nutrition Policy, and a baseline for the KP Fishery Sector. The project closely aligns with KP government priorities to improve the lives of the farming communities, he added.\nStephen Berlinguette, the USAID Pakistan Deputy Director on CSG, while addressing the audience, said that the US Government and Pakistan had worked together for almost 75 years on issues of bilateral interest, including energy, economic growth, peace-building, health, and education; and the work of USAID Pakistan had directly supported the country’s development aspirations, as outlined in the Pakistan Vision 2025 contributing towards a sustainable, self-reliant, and prosperous Pakistan. And through the LFSA project, USAID Pakistan would love to see enhanced productivity of crops and livestock; and make the Newly Merged Districts (NMDs) of KP a more prosperous, food secure, and economically vibrant region of the province.\nTheme-based working groups were formed during the event, giving participants the opportunity to present their recommendations on the key subjects during various sessions.\nThe final session included the validation of baseline findings by all stakeholders. In the concluding note, Mr. Farrukh Toirov, Provincial Head of FAO KP Office, thanked everyone for their input, expert opinions, and validation of the baseline findings.\nThe meeting of key stakeholders and beneficiaries within this forum facilitated a dynamic dialogue concerning project activities and projected a course forward for increased impact.\nThe project aims to impact and improve livelihoods and food security for the targeted 150,000 households through agriculture-led growth in KP and flood-affected areas of Pakistan.\nThe project’s goal is to restore “cropping systems” and encourage the adoption of technological advancements for enhanced productivity and better livelihoods. This will be achieved through strengthening and modernizing the agriculture and livestock sectors, creating assets, and diversifying livelihood options.",
