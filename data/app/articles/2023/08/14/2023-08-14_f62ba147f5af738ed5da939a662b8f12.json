We should continue striving to help the affected people, as many are still struggling with unemployment, health, economic needs, housing, and other issues and challenges.\nHe also prayed that may Almighty God continue to bestow His blessings upon our country and grant us the spirit to work together in unity for the development and prosperity of Pakistan so that all may live together as one nation in love, peace and harmony.\nA cake cutting ceremony was also held after the flag hoisting ceremony.
