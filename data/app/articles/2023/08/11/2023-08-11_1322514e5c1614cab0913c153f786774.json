He however stressed that policing could be further made responsive to the issues of religious minorities.\nOn the occasion, the Director General of, the National Police Bureau, Dr. Ehsan Sadiq stated that the criminal justice system in Pakistan should be responsive to play a very instrumental role in the protection of the rights of minorities. While policing issues of minorities, the officers must consider other social facts that enhance the marginality of the minorities.\nHe stated that the learnings at the top cadre level shall translate to junior officers adopting citizen-centric and victim-centred approaches.\nMarry James Gill, from the Centre for Law & Justice, stated that state institutions should empathetically and institutionally respond to the problems of minority communities and neighbourhoods keeping in mind that they are marginalized, and hardened policing may enhance that.\nSyed Kausar Abbas, Executive Director of Sustainable Social Development Organization (SSDO) discussed that community policing, if adopted, can help address various issues and challenges in the protection of the rights of religious minorities.\nThe event was attended by officials of the Police Force, Civil Society Organizations and representatives from religious minority communities.",
