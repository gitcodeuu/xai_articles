Bilateral trade is currently worth over £4 billion, nearly doubling in 3 years, said a press release issued by the British High Commission on Saturday.\nThe British High Commissioner will also visit HMS Lancaster in Karachi as part of routine bilateral Royal Navy-Pakistan Navy training exercise. These exercises are part of a range of ‘Defence Diplomacy’ activities, part of the UK’s commitment to maintaining its well-established defence relationship with Pakistan.\nThe High Commissioner said that Karachi was one of the best places in Pakistan to discuss business, the country’s beating heart and home to some of the country’s most pioneering industries. I am looking forward to hearing from UK and Pakistani businesses on how we can support each other’s ambitious trade goals, she expressed.",
