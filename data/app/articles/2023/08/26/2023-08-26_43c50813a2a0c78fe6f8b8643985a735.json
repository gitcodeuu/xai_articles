They blocked a road to voice their grievances. They said their area has been grappling with a dire shortage of clean drinking water for several months but the responsible department has remained unresponsive to their plight.\nA local resident said, “We are left with no choice but to consume contaminated water, which has inevitably taken a toll on our health.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
