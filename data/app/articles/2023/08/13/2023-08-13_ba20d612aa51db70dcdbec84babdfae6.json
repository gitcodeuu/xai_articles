Despite his tender age, his demeanor and presence radiated the dignity and poised befitting a ruler of his stature, he added.\nHe said the purpose of King Faisal’s visit went beyond mere ceremony as it signified a strengthening of diplomatic ties and a growing partnership between the two nations.\nHe said King George V extended the invitation as a gesture of goodwill and mutual respect, reflecting the positive rapport established between the two monarchs.\nDr. Naif said the young Saudi King’s visit was meticulously planned, with a series of meetings, diplomatic discussions, and cultural exchanges scheduled throughout his stay.
