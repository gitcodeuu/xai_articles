The latest arms and ammunition left behind by the foreign forces had fallen into the hands of terrorist outfits and criminal organizations, and even with the dacoits which posed a challenge to the government, he added.\nThe foreign minister, to a question, further said that they expected the Afghan interim government to take actions against the terrorist organizations and honour their commitment made with the international community not to allow their soil for terrorist activities against any country under the Doha Agreement.\nHe said Pakistan’s stance was clear and it had demanded the Afghan interim set up to curb terrorism, as cooperation against the menace of terrorism was in the interest of both countries. Afghanistan had no standing army, anti-terrorists force or border management force which caused the capacity issues to face terrorism, he opined.\n“In the past, we had faced the threats and together will face them,” he added. Pakistan, he said, was ready to assist them as they had the capacity issues to deal with such threats.\nThe foreign minister, to another question, said that the Pakistan Peoples Party believed that decisions regarding the interim set-up and elections should be taken to strengthen the civilian institutions and the democratic system in the country.\nThey believed that all issues confronted by the country could be addressed through a democratic dispensation which would ensure the political and economic stability, he said, adding the general polls should be held on time so that the people could exercise their right.\nAbout reforms introduced in his ministry, the foreign minister said that different initiatives under the key four components were launched which would improve functioning of the ministry by making it more agile, nimble and efficient to face the new emerging challenges.\nHe said a total of 51 initiatives were taken at different work streams among which 19 were completed, three were partially implemented while 29 were in on the track to completion.\nThe ceremony was also attended by Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khan, diplomats, officials, and Pakistan’s ambassadors abroad through video link.\nLater, the foreign minister also inaugurated solarization of the ministry.",
