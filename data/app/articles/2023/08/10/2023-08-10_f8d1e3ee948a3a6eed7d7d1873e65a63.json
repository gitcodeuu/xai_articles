Either they are my personal secretaries, military secretary, drivers, cook, telephone operators, deputy secretaries, PSOs, or others, all did their duties with due diligence and guided me on various matters,” he added.\nHe said due to economic challenges, the cabinet members voluntarily withdrew from perks and privileges and most of them did not draw their salaries.\nOn the occasion the prime minister also distributed certificates of appreciation among the staff of grades 1 to 16.",
