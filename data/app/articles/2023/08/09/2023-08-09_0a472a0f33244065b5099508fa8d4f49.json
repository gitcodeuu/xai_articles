  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 09 (APP): As the curtains fall on the current term of Pakistan’s National Assembly, lawmakers on Wednesday reflected a blend of nostalgia and a forward-looking vision during the final session of the 15th National Assembly.\nElected representatives from diverse parties contemplated the achievements and hurdles of their term as they addressed the assembly for the final time, providing insight into the shared emotions that influence the nation’s political sphere.\nThe last sitting not only served as more than just a conclusion to a chapter but also set the stage for the evolving narrative of Pakistan’s democratic journey.\nSardar Akhtar Mengal in his farewell speech said the current assembly was going to complete its constitutional tenure which was a good omen. His party inked a written agreement with the past government led by Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) for resolution of grave issues of Balochistan, he said.\nHe said they also presented their issues before the incumbent prime minister and the federal cabinet but unfortunately no vain.\nHe said he tabled a bill about enforced missing of people but could not pass. He said Balochistan never objected over past census but regretted that  7.3 million less people were shown in the latest censure.\nNoor Alam Khan said he always raised voice against sky rocketing inflation in the country. Increase in petroleum prices directly affected poor and common people, he said.\nHe lauded the prime minister for provision of gas and electricity to his constituency which was completely deprived in past.\nMaulana Abdul Akbar Chitrali said the country could not progress without complete elimination of interest based system in the country.\nHe had also submitted a bill in 2019 in this regard but it could not come on agenda of the house.\nShahid Khaqan Abbasi said the House was not complete with the opposition. Pointing towards members sitting in front row, he said that they all remained in jail but unfortunately in past their production orders were not issued.\nHe said image of the politicians in peoples’ eye was not good and they considered them corrupt people. The parliament was sole organization which has authority to levy taxes on the people, he said.\nWhether, the people who were sitting here they themselves paid taxes, he questioned.\nMinister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Javed Abbasi congratulated the entire leadership for completing its constitutional term. In past, the National Assembly was unconstitutionally dissolved by the PTI but through joint efforts, it was restored, he said.\nHe said the PTI government pushed the country towards bankruptcy but the allied government through hectic efforts saved the country from default.\nHe regretted that unfortunately they could not take action against those who breached the constitution for sake of their own personal interest.\nLater, the National Assembly passed private member bills the Rahim Jan University Bill, 2023 and the Acid and Burn Crime Bill, 2022 passed.\nEarlier, Murtaza Javed Abbasi moved motions to suspend the rules and take up the said bills.\nLater, the House was prorogued the house sine die.",
