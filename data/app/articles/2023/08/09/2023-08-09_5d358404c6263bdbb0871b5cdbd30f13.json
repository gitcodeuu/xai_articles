It is my tenth year after successfully completing my Fulbright scholarship. I have developed an ICARE (climate advocacy and education initiative)programme to support the impoverished children in educational institutions to learn more about climate change and action,” he added.\nWaqas Idrees had also worked with the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) on its energy-related projects, competitive auctions on renewables and also working with the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS).\nThe ICARE initiative, he said was focussing on the children belonging to the middle calls who were unlike the elites not aware of climate change. It was working with private, public and charity schools supporting out-of-school children.\nHe suggested that there was a need to improve communication and the top-down approach to achieve youth inclusion and integration.\nSana Tahir, an environmentalist working with the National Cleaner Production Center Foundation (NCPC) also availed an opportunity in 2013 under the U.S. legislative fellowship programme. She had done her BS and MS in Environmental Sciences from the University of the Punjab.\nShe said that she had learned a lot about cultural issues during her U.S. experience and also acquired knowledge about Eco-Roof topping and other innovative concepts.\nShe visited government and power organisations in the U.S. during her fellowship. Sana Tahir appreciated the civil society and volunteer work that inspired her and moved her to replicate it back in the country.\nShe mentioned that the civil society in the U.S. was more empowered as compared to Pakistan and was always ready to work and have an enhanced policy footprint. For example, she said Saturdays were dedicated to volunteer work.\nShe encouraged women and girls to visit the U.S. and learn new technologies and techniques.\nDirector General World Wide Fund for Nature Pakistan (WWF-Pakistan), Hammad Naqi Khan said WWF is the largest environmental organisation globally and also in Pakistan.\nHe said the members of PUAN came from diverse backgrounds, areas, genders and social cohorts and it was very important to take the opportunity to sensitise and impart the gravity of the issue to them for a stronger and effective climate action.\nHe added that these experts should be infused with a proactive approach to climate change as the climate crisis was one of the biggest challenges and also an economic challenge for Pakistan.\n“Our economy is based on water. For us, climate change is water change. Half of the water comes from glaciers and half from monsoon rains. The studies clearly say that the third largest snow reserve outside the polar region is in Pakistan and it is melting at a faster pace. In the first cycle we will have more water and then it will decline but our population is growing,” the DG WWF-Pakistan said.\nHe said the climate disasters would accelerate in the coming years where as an individual, farmers, industrialists and others everybody had to play their roles for a climate-resilient and sustainable future.\n“Climate change can’t be tackled in isolation. It is imperative to engage these professionals like PUAN alumni to spread the message,” he said.\nHe said that though PUAN had a good foundation and needed to roll out milestone targets for climate action and resilience measures. “Let’s have some pragmatic and ambitious milestones through the platform of PUAN and it should monitor its implementation for result-oriented interventions,” he added.",
