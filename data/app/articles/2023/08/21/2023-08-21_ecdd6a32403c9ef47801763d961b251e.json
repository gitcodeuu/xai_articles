Shaw, Bishop Yousaf Sohan, Bishop Inderias Rehmat and Bishop Khalid Rehmat said in a statement.\nThey said Pakistan Catholic Bishops’ Conference strongly condemns the incident and terms it the worst incident against Christians.\n“The PCBC denounces this shameful act, and urge the government to take stern action against the culprits to bring them to justice. We ask for strong measures to protect the minorities and bring such policies that can help us as a nation to become peaceful human beings and a better society so that such incident may not take place in future.\nThey said the strong reaction and condemnation has come from people from all walks of life to this horrible incident. “The Prime Minister, Chief Minister of Punjab, Ulemas, religious leaders, politicians, government officials and individuals have been expressing their solidarity with the Christian community.”\nThey said the visit of the Apex’s Court’s Judge to the Christian colony of Jaranwala has been very comforting and consoling.\n“We ask for taking strong action against all those who were involved in taking the law in to their own hands. We assure that the Christian Community will continue to contribute to the peace, prosperity and progress of our beloved country.
