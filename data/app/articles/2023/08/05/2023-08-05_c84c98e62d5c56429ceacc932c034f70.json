Let’s need to work hand in hand for climate change emergency with the commitment it demands,” he said.\nDirector General, Worldwide Fund for Nature (WWF-Pakistan) Hammad Naqi Khan in his keynote address said the Fund have been continuously advocating that climate crisis was a national crisis in Pakistan.\nPakistan, he said is at the top of the most vulnerable countries and it was a flood plain area that always experienced floods.\nHe reiterated the words of the UN Secretary General saying, “The Monsoon on steroids happened in 2022 as from hill torrents in the north to rainfall of biblical proportion in the south plains left millions of people devastated and livestock killed.”\nAfter that, he said in COP-27, Egypt loss and damage fund was pleaded which was around $60 billion to assist the developing countries worst impacted due to climate catastrophes.\n“Pakistan is not the last country facing climate stress as it will reach every country. The heatwaves in the States after Pakistan prove the fact. July is the hottest month ever recorded in the history of this planet. Global warming has changed into global boiling after such temperature rise,” he said.\nPakistan is among the few countries having climate change ministry whereas a Climate Change unit has to be at the center of every ministry and department because everybody was suffering of it, he said.\nHe mentioned that Pakistan had multiple natural disasters from floods to forest fires and droughts to glacial melt, adding, “It’s important to build that capacity to face those challenges”.\nThe Green Climate Fund (GCF) with the help of USAID approved $70 million for Recharge Pakistan project which would promote nature based solutions in conserving floodwater and reviving depleting aquifers, he added.\n“We need support as climate change needs a collective action. The US Educational Foundation and PUAN are the policy and decision makers that should have this vision at the core of their interventions. It’s possibile only by making efforts together,” Khan said.\nLater, the U.S. Ambassador held a brief press talk to apprise the media on PUAN and WWF-Pakistan jointly held two-day Climate Change conference.\nAmbassador Blome said almost 120 Pakistan-US Alumni Network (PUAN) participants were present at the conference on Climate Change.\nThe alumni network comprised of different people belonging from various backgrounds who were committed to find solutions to climate change through innovation, creative solutions and technology.\nUS-Pakistan Green Alliance was investing millions of dollars in climate smart agriculture, green energy transition initiatives and various other interventions focussing on climate resilience, he added.\nThe PUAN is full of dedicated volunteers that are committed to the cause of climate change, he added.\nPrivate sector innovation, he said was important and the US Embassy was working with many startups especially the one working on locally made EVs, and climate smart agriculture.\n“I have also visited U.S.-Pakistan advance energy set ups being established with the cooperation of USAID.
