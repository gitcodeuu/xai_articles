The message serves as a powerful reminder of the sacrifices made by Kashmiris and their ongoing struggle for self-determination.\nThe Chairman Senate called upon the international community to uphold justice and adhere to the principles of international law. He emphasized the importance of a peaceful resolution in line with the aspirations of the Kashmiri people.\nYoum-e-Istehsal serves as a collective call to action, urging the world to recognize the rights of the Kashmiri people and address their grievances, he said.\nHe said that Pakistan was committed to justice, human rights and peace in the region.",
