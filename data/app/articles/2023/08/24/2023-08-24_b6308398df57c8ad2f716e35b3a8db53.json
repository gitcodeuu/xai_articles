They asserted that constituency delimitation isn’t presently required. Their requests encompass the immediate release of detained party members, the authorization to hold political rallies, and the equitable provision of political opportunities for PTI, akin to other parties.\nThe JUI-F delegation, led by Maulana Abdul Ghafoor Haidari, Jalaluddin, Maulana Darwish, Kamran Murtaza (via video link) and other members, emphasized that while the constitutional obligation for holding elections is undeniable, they suggested that given the official publication of census results, the Election Commission should prioritize concluding the constituency delimitation process. This would ensure comprehensive facilitation for all political parties, candidates, and voters in the forthcoming elections.\nThey further said that according to the new census, the correct registration of voters in the electoral rolls should be ensured by the Election Commission before the election, and the lists of more polling stations should also be corrected and impartial and honest returning officers and district returning officers.",
