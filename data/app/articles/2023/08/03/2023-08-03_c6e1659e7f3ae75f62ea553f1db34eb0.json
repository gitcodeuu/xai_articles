  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 3 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi Thursday here underscored the need for focus on poverty alleviation, education, and preventive health to bring real change in Pakistan and ensure the protection of rights of deprived communities.\nSpeaking at a ceremony of the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICC), he urged that the foundation of the country needed to be strengthened and basic issues like education and health should be resolved to put Pakistan on the path of further progress and prosperity.\nHe underlined the need for better decision-making and implementation of policies in the economic and social sectors to transform society for the better.\nHe cited the example of Korea which adopted the policies of Pakistan’s economist Dr Mehboob ul Haq in the 1960s and grew speedily, saying in the past in Pakistan only lip service was paid and the country could not make its economy flourish.\nHe said investments in the real estate sector were important but the money should stay in circulation instead of getting stuck in buying of properties, adding wealth should be shared and invested for gainful employment of the people.\nHe said the concept of nation-state pursued by European countries failed in many aspects, exploited humans and could not stop bloodshed even in the present century, for example in the ongoing war in Ukraine.\nHe said Pakistan was an Islamic democratic state and its people should be guided by the Quran, Sunnah and opinions of its religious scholars and communities. Reciting the verses of Quran, he said Quran offered solutions for living a moral life leading to the righteous path.\nThe President was of the view that Islam was not only about rituals but had some basic concepts which should be adopted to keep traveling on the righteous path.Muslims in Pakistan should inculcate fear of Allah, adopt values of honesty and piety and cultivate the spirit of sharing one’s earnings with the needy and vulnerable people in society, he emphasised.“We should have strong faith in the revelations of Quran and the hereafter and we should take care of the needs of the poor to seek blessings of Allah.”\nDr Alvi said Pakistan should not rely on foreign aid but people should focus on improving their character, developing a sense of community, giving charity and pursuing values that create a better and God-fearing society.\nSociety as a whole should take steps to empower women because Quaid-e-Azam categorically stated that without progress of women Pakistan could not move forward, he said adding Islam was the first religion that gave women the right to inheritance.\nHe lamented the fact that 27 million children in Pakistan were out of school and were deprived of education which should be a matter of grave concern for the policymakers, adding the rights of persons with disabilities should be protected.President ICCI Ahsan Zafar Bakhtawari also spoke on the occasion and highlighted issues faced by the business community.Earlier, he gave away recognition shields among the former vice presidents of the Islamabad Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ICCI).",
