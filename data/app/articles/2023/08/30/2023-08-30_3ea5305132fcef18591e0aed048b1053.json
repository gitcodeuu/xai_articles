As she was released after getting bail in two cases, she was arrested again in the third case, he added.\nJustice Miangul Hassan Aurangzeb said that the court had asked Imaan Mazari to prevail upon her mother Shireen Mazari not to say certain words and she gave assurance in that regard but later she even could not even control herself to utter such words.\nThe lawyer said that one should be sentenced for committing a crime, but the case  against his client had been registered in bad intention.\nHe prayed the court to stop the authorities from arresting Mazari in any other case and also seek details of cases against her.
