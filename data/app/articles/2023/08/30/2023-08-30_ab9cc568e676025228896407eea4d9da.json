  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 30 (APP): The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on Wednesday directed the power distribution companies (DISCOs) to improve their performance in 15 days and submit a report in that regard.\n“NEPRA will conduct a hearing after three weeks to review the performance of DISCOs”, a news release said.\nNEPRA heard the request of Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPAG) regarding monthly fuel adjustment charges of Rs 2.07 per unit for the month of July. However, during the hearing the CPPAG reviewed its request from Rs. 2.07 to Rs. 1.57 per unit raise on account of FCA.\nThe Authority asked as to why the cost of electricity production with coal was higher despite the decrease in the price of coal while asking the CPPGA to submit performance report of coal power plants.\nIt observed that some expensive power plants were being run due to low capacity of Gatti and some other grids for last few years.\nThe Authority asked National Transmission & Despatch Company (NTDC) to submit a report as to why the capacity of Gatti and some other grids was not increased.\nNEPRA also directed the DISCOs to take action for reducing line loses and stopping electricity theft.",
