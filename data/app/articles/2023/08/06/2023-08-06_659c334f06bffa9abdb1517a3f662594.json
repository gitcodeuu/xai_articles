She also proposed a resolution to phase out fossil fuel in collaboration with SDPI.\nSenator Taj Haider emphasized on addressing the policy inconsistency in energy sector of Pakistan to ensure a rapid off take of RE in Pakistan. He said that 3000MW electricity was generated from wind and solar at Jhimpir but poor transition infrastructure hindered supply to other areas and these issues were impeding foreign investor interest in wind and solar power plants.\nHe informed that the Senate had unanimously passed a resolution proposing that industrial areas must be equipped with solar parks. He further said that 50,000 houses had been reconstructed, 200,000 houses had been solarized and out of the 2000 700 reverse osmosis plants were solarized in Sindh after 2020 floods. He urged for improving transmission infrastructure and installing local grid systems to improve energy access in impoverished areas.\nDr Shafqat Munir, Deputy Executive Director, SDPI said that energy, water and agriculture were crucial contemporary issues exacerbated by climate change and SDPI was keen to support policymakers in developing policies for mitigation action and boosting the clean energy transition.\nHe also presented a motion urging the Parliament to address the action gap to ensure the smooth energy transition in favor of renewable energy sources, by advocating the establishment of “International Treaty to phase out fossil fuels”.\nDr Khalid Waleed, Research Fellow, SDPI, presented “Agenda for Energy Sector Reforms” which are structured around five key areas; Transition to Renewable Energy, Economic Recovery of Energy Sector, Electrification and Decarbonization of End-Use sectors, Rural Electrification, and Increased focus on Demand side management.\nDr Sebastian Paust, Head of Development Cooperation, German Embassy in Pakistan, stressed that Pakistan must couple international energy financing with indigenous funds mobilization to ensure clean energy transition is resilient to external shocks.\nHe stressed on simplifying regulatory frameworks and import polices for renewable energy to bolster investor trust, mobilize private finance, and develop indigenous production capacity through foreign direct investment partnerships.\nSyed Aqeel Jafri, Director Policy at Alternative Energy Development Board, stressed on revamping transmission infrastructure, supporting indigenous manufacturing landscape of renewable energy technologies and active engagement by incentivizing private sector.\nBadar Alam, Chief Executive Officer, Policy Research Institute for Equitable Development (PRIED) stressed that renewable energy policies must ensure climate and social justice by prioritizing the marginalized communities as an essential component of the just energy transition.\nAsad Mahmood urged for anchoring production of renewable energy in industrial areas and installing renewable energy powered equipment in industries through legislative instruments and empowering local communities to run off-grid energy projects to promote energy access.\nDr Hassan Daud, Research Fellow, SDPI expressed that although public finances alone are insufficient, mobilizing indigenous finances and addressing regulatory framework gaps can fast-track the clean energy transition and build a strong business case to reinvigorate investor interest and trust.\nThe parliamentary consultation was also attended by senior experts from academia, CSOs, finance sector, development partners and diplomatic missions.",
