Nawaz Sharif launched China Pakistan Economic Corridor, made the country’s defence impregnable and spread network of roads across Pakistan, she added.\nMarriyum said curbs were imposed on the media and freedom of expression during the four-year of the PTI, however, the press clubs across the country provided a platform to the then opposition leaders to spread their messages among the masses and highlight fascism of the previous regime.\nShe said the PTI chairman was declared “predator” for media by the international organization, but Pakistan ranking in press freedom improved during the last fifteen months of the coalition government.\nShe said the PEMRA Ordinance of 2002 was a “black law” which was enacted by a dictator, but it was the coalition government which introduced amendments after twelve months of extensive consultation with the relevant stakeholders.\nThe PEMRA (Amendment) Bill 2023 would not be enacted until all the objections raised on the legislation were addressed, she added.\nTo a query, she said the appointment of caretaker PM was a constitutional responsibility of the Prime Minister and the Opposition Leader, and the people would be informed as soon as the names for the purpose would be finalized.\nThe National Assembly would be dissolved on August 9, she said, adding responsibility of holding election was on the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nThe minister expressed the confidence that the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) would be victorious in the next general elections under the leadership of former prime minister Mian Mohammed Nawaz Sharif.\nShe said that Gawadar was part of the country and the economic progress relied on the ports.\nMarriyum Aurangzeb said that the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project was stopped by the previous\ngovernment and it was restored by the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif soon after coming into the power.\nShe said that the coalition government made the extensive efforts to chart the country on the path of progress and economic stability.\nThe minister said former Prime Minister Mohammed Nawaz Sharif said goodbye to International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2016 but the previous government signed the agreement again and then violated and suspended it for political gains.\nShe said the coalition government after coming into power re-negotiated the deal and reached a 9-month standby agreement with the IMF to save the country from default.\nShe said the prime minister had presided over the meeting of Council of Common Interests (CCI) which unanimously approved the results of Digital Census 2023. The CCI meeting had the participation of all provinces and political parties.\n“Throughout the world, there is a system in place for attracting foreign direct investment, and the purpose of the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) is to facilitate direct foreign investment by providing a one-window operation to the investors,” she said while responding to another query.\nThe Prime Minister had brought all institutions together under the umbrella of SIFC, she said while condemning the propaganda which alleged that the certain lands were being handed over to the council.\nShe said process for investment in five sectors under SIFC had been uploaded on digital portal, which would be made accessible for general public and through this, all reservations will be addressed.\nAll provinces and ministries are made part of SIFC, she added.\nThe initiative would end Pakistan’s reliance on foreign debts, she said while citing examples Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Iran, Iraq, and other western countries that following the same initiative for attracting foreign investment.\nAt the outset of press conference, the minister expressed her grief over the train accident took place near Nawabshah today.\nShe prayed to the Almighty to rest the departed souls in the eternal peace and grant courage to the bereaved families to bear irreparable loss.\nThe Federal Minister for Railways has held a detailed press conference regarding the incident, she said, adding relief operation was underway at the site of the accident.\nThe minister said all departments had been directed to actively participate in the relief operation.\nShe said the Railways minister had stated that inquiry report of the incident would be made public.",
