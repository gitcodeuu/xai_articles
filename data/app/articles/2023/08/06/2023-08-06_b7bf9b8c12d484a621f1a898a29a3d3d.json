However, the new efficient power plants utilize 10% less coal as compared to ordinary plants.\nEnergy sector experts have also emphasized the significance of utilizing indigenous Thar coal in addressing Pakistan’s energy needs as they opine that rising oil and gas prices in the international market make it even more crucial for Pakistan to rely on its own coal reserves.\n“Energy crisis in Pakistan remains a pressing issue with energy efficiency not being prioritized,” remarked former Chief Economist of the Planning Commission, Dr Pervez Tahir. “Even the private sector contributes to the problem through the use of outdated boilers and equipments.”\nHe said as the major chunk of our energy mix comes from thermal besides also relying on fossil fuels, therefore despite climate concerns Pakistan’s energy crisis was so dire that it could not survive without coal energy.\nSince uninterrupted power supply is considered crucial for the development of industrial, agricultural and domestic sectors, its smooth supply to domestic consumers is equally important.\n“The present government has already added 5300 MW cheap electricity to the system from Thar coal reserves in just 10 months besides 720 MW and 1100 MW from Karot Hydropower and K-3 Nuclear Power Plants,” said Minister for Power Division Engineer Khurram Dastgir.\nThe minister informed that total power generation from Thar coal stood at 2640 MW with the formal commissioning of 1320 MW Shanghai Electric Thar Coal Project under the CPEC.\nRising fuel prices and new energy situation after Ukraine war had also necessitated Pakistan to utilize its indigenous resources like hydel, solar, wind and Thar coal as it has already announced not to build any new power projects depending on imported coal and ensure 60 percent of its power through local sources by 2030.\nKhurram Dastgir said the PML-N government led by the then Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif had successfully added over 10,000 MW electricity to national grid through China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) projects during 2013 to 2018.\n“Efforts of the then PML-N government had not only controlled load-shedding but added surplus power to the system,” he remarked. “The criminal negligence of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf government had delayed number of projects dragging the country to the verge darkness once again.”\nThe federal government in collaboration with the Sindh government has also chalked out a policy framework on the Thar Coal mines project aimed at connecting it with other coal-powered power plants in the country producing 4,000 MW.\nSince, the energy crisis continues to haunt our domestic, commercial and industrial consumers, therefore it is direly needed to ensure continuity of policy and diligently pursue the agenda of making Pakistan energy self-sufficient to secure a better future for our coming generations.",
