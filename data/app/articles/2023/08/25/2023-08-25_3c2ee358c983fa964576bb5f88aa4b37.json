The initiative fosters a seamless coordination mechanism through an Inter-Agency Coordination protocol, connecting various departments to ensure a comprehensive response to child rights violations.\nZahida Manzoor from UNICEF, in her welcome speech, expressed the significance of the collaborative effort in strengthening the child protection system.\nThe keynote speech by Director General Child Protection Welfare Bureau, Aftab Ahmad shed light on the collective commitment to safeguarding children’s rights.\nThe event concluded with closing remarks from Shabnam Baloch, Country Director of the International Rescue Committee, reaffirming the organization’s dedication to this noble cause.\nThis initiative is bolstered by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between IRC, CPWB, and the Social Welfare Department at the provincial level, ensuring a trickle-down effect of cooperation and collaboration at the district level. The coordinated efforts between these key stakeholders will play a pivotal role in upholding the rights and protection of children in the region.\nAs this CPU commences its operations, it heralds a new era of safeguarding children’s rights and creating an environment where they can thrive without fear.\nThe collaboration between UNICEF, IRC, CPWB, and the Government of Punjab sets a remarkable precedent for effective child protection measures that will undoubtedly serve as a beacon of hope for children and families across the region.",
