Pakistan is on the brink of crisis like Sri Lanka which needs to be averted, he said adding that otherwise, the county would import essential goods like medicines and fuel for transport.\nThe government needs to strengthen social protection to cushion the lower income segments during the economic crisis, he expressed.\nReferring to the recent international financing pledges, he said we cannot rely on the pledges to shore up our foreign exchange reserves.\nJoint Executive Director SDPI Dr Vaqar Ahmed stressed on achieving political stability and said that the lenders wanted assurance for repayment of long-term loans often undermined by political strife in the country.\nAssistant Professor Habib University Dr Aqdas Afzal predicted that by agreeing to the IMF’s conditions, the country can avert the immediate crisis, but the storm is yet to be over.\nHe said that with the net foreign exchange reserves held by SBP at $4.6 Billion, the policy makers need to maneuver tactfully as pressure will mount further in coming months.\nHe urged the policy makers to extend social protection, increase stipends of BISP for the most vulnerable communities for sustainable reforms.",
