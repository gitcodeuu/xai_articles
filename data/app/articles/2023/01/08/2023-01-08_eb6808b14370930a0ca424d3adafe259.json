  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 08 (APP): Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) is going to release the first quarterly installment of Rs 7,000 to the Kafaalat programme beneficiaries for the year 2023 from Monday.\nAbout 7.7 million families would receive over Rs 55 billion in the first tranche. The beneficiaries women and transgender hailing from Islamabad, Punjab, Sindh, and Balochistan would receive this money from the payment centers or biometric automated teller machines (ATMs) designated by Habib Bank; while in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, the funds would be disbursed through payment centers or biometric ATMs of Bank Al-Falah.\nMinister for Poverty Alleviation and Social Safety and BISP Chairperson Shazia Marri, in her message to beneficiaries, said transparency would be ensured at all costs during the disbursements of funds.\nShe asked the beneficiaries to receive their full installment of Rs 7,000 and forget not to get the payment receipt by the quarter concerned.\nShe further said neither there would be a deduction nor charged any payment fee on this amount. “If someone demands any kind of deduction or fee for payment, beneficiaries should immediately report to BISP’s toll-free helpline 080026477 or contact the nearest BISP Tehsil Office,” she maintained.\nShazia Marri warned the beneficiaries that the message sent by BISP would come from 8171, and no message from any other number or code should be trusted as it is fake and fraudulent.",
