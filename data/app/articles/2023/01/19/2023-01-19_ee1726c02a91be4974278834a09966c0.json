There are still 20 million people who need humanitarian assistance, and 8 million people are exposed to flood waters,” she said.\nThe minister highlighted, “These disasters are not just acts of God, instead are the outcomes of prolonged anthropogenic activities – as these are man-made disasters and we shouldn’t deflect the responsibility by calling it an act of God alone.”\nThe minister also spoke at a panel discussion titled ‘Investing in Nature’ organised by The Maryam Forum Foundation where she was joined by the Minister for International Cooperation of the Government of Egypt, Rania Mashat, President, Center for Global Development, Sir Masood Ahmed, Chief Economist, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, Erik Berglöf, and Chief Sustainability Officer, Mastercard, USA, Ellen Jackowski.\nThe session was moderated by journalist Nik Gowing, founder of Thinking the Unthinkable and former BBC World News presenter.The Minister said that climate change and biodiversity are critical issues that require a scientific approach to guide our decisions, but current efforts have fallen short.\n“There is an element of denialism still amongst corporate leaders and networks which shows our collective failure as we have not been able to take the public conversations to the required level.\nEvery little island of rationality works, and every meeting today should be a call to action.\nOur models of business and government need to change for that critical mass that is needed to shift the needle on biodiversity loss and climate action because we are way off the mark”, she remarked.\nMinister Rehman urged that coalitions are needed to meet the climate action targets. “We must build coalitions for climate action.\nSo far, we have mostly been talking and working in silos due to the boundaries we have set on ourselves.\nEveryone is speaking about the individual actions they are taking but we need to move beyond that to a surface with achievable collective action targets and then pledge to actually meet them,” she stated.\nThe Minister also highlighted that the climate financing needs of today are not being addressed by the 20th century international financial architecture as it was created for different challenges, but it is outdated for the crises of the 21st century.\n“We need a redesign of the entire Bretton Woods financial architecture and make climate financing agile and easily available for countries that are at the forefront of climate stress.\nIf we don’t take collective and radical actions within this decade, what is happening in Pakistan will come to Davos someday, but after 1/3 of the globe is living in the 19th century again that has bred from our lack of collective action,” she said\nIn an interview with Axios, the Minister said that countries on the climate frontline face a recovery trap.\n“We did well in Geneva in securing recovery funds that will help us in providing humanitarian assistance with our development partners because the humanitarian crisis is not over, and for also creating bankable projects for reconstruction.\nHowever, it is a race against time for us as we are caught in a recovery trap – the scale of reconstruction itself will take 3 years or more, and what happens if we face another natural disaster before the rebuilding even begins? We are in a clear arc of vulnerability, and we are working very hard to make sure that there is better preparedness and adaptation on the ground to avoid such a catastrophe in the future,” she remarked.",
