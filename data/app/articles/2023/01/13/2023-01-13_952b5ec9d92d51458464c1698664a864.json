  "content": "MULTAN, Jan 13 (APP): Chief Justice Lahore High Court (LHC) Muhammad Ameer Bhatti on Friday ordered Habib Bank Limited (HBL) to ensure facilitation of Kafalat Programme under Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) through ATMs of all branches round-the-clock. He said that the facilitation should be extended across the Multan division immediately and no inefficiency would be tolerated in this connection.\nHe passed on these orders during a hearing in his chamber at LHC Multan bench after taking strict notice of long queues of women outside the ATM of HBL main branch for withdrawing of quarterly installment.\nBefore the hearing, the Chief Justice directed the Senior Registrar to conduct an inquiry within one hour about the matter. He summoned Zonal Head BISP, Sheikh Amin and HBL regional head Multan, M Awais Bhatti and heard them in the chamber.\nAwais Bhatti briefed the Chief Justice that owing to rush of customers, biometric for BISP beneficiaries opens at 4pm which results in long queues adding that they could withdraw the installment from specific branches of HBL.\nThe Chief Justice expressed annoyance over the smaller number of ATMs for this purpose and questioned why there are only a few branch facilities for 82,000 beneficiaries. He directed the HBL and BISP administrations to advertise on TV and newspapers about the branches and the amount the beneficiaries can withdraw.",
