Yet it is the harsh reality for the 33 million people who were affected by them. The floods show all too clearly the severe consequences that climate change has for the world’s most vulnerable people.”\nHe further said that Denmark had already supported Pakistan by providing water purification and humanitarian aid in connection with the floods.\n“I am happy that we announced a further DKK 26.7 million through the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) to support the nearly 10 million children, who continue to need humanitarian aid” he added.\nThe minister said, “We are looking forward to further deepening bilateral relations between Denmark and Pakistan and developing a Resilient Pakistan.”",
