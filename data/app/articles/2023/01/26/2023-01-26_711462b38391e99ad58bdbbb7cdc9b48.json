The same five sittings were adjourned due to lack of quorum.\nDuring the 321st session, the Senate passed 14 bills. Out of these, 3 private members’ bills were introduced in the Senate while 8 government bills and 3 private members’ bills were transmitted from the National Assembly.\nTwenty Private Members’ bills were introduced during the session and all of them were referred to the concerned committees. No ordinance was laid or extended during the session.\nDuring the 321st session, total time consumed for discussion on policy issues spanned over only 3 hours while the Senate consumed 11 hours and 46 minutes on discussion of non-policy issues.\nThe maximum time consumed in discussing policy issues was on a motion ‘Imposition of taxes on tobacco industry of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa’ for 40 minutes while the House spent 1 hour and 40 minutes and 1 hour and 37 minutes on discussing non-policy issues of ‘Deteriorating economic conditions and inflation in Pakistan’ and ‘Inefficiency of the government in dealing with floods victims and rehabilitation work’ respectively.\nIt must be noted that PILDAT has classified that a policy issue is such that involves any amendment in a bill or a recommendation on devising a policy. Any discussion on an issue that does not go beyond mere criticism or highlighting a concern does not fall into policy issue and is treated as discussion or time spent on non-policy issues.",
