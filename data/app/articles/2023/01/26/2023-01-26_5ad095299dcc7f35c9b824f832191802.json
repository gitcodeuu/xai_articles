In 2017 the United States was the sole funder for this project, providing $4.5 million for the Improving Rule of Law in Balochistan project.\nThe United States played a significant role in the training of Pakistan’s civilian law enforcement capacity and this has included training for more than 120,000 Pakistani police officers, incorporating international standards for crime response, investigations, and handling of evidence into their courses.\n“We contributed to the construction of over 230 border posts along the Pakistan-Afghanistan border. In Balochistan, we have provided over $20 million to purchase bulletproof vests, helmets, and vehicles to enhance law enforcement operations and keep officers safe while fighting crime, he added.”\nAmbassador Blome also highlighted U.S. flood assistance, adding “To date, we have committed more than $200 million in flood-response, disaster resilience, and food security assistance. Our support includes urgently needed food, safe water, sanitation and hygiene improvements, financial help, and shelter assistance.\nIt also includes work with the Balochistan Police, including replacing police stations destroyed in the floods and providing a new wall and drainage system to better protect the Balochistan Police Training College in Quetta.\nWe are doing what friends and partners do in times of hardship – support each other.”\nIn his opening remarks, Jeremy Milsom, Country Representative, UNODC Country Office in Pakistan highlighted UNODC’s continued support towards improving the rule of law sector in Balochistan.\nHe thanked U.S. Embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) section for its support and appreciated the Government of Balochistan’s collaboration towards strengthening and reforming criminal justice institutions in the province.\nThe Program aimed to enhance the technical and operational capacity of the Balochistan Police through training sessions on crime scene investigation, forensic examination skills, and the provision of modern equipment. Improved cooperation between police and prosecution for better justice outcome remained a core component of the Program.\nUNODC under INL funding equipped the Crime Branch of Balochistan Police with 10 Mobile Crime Scene Units, 2,250 First Responders and 250 Crime Scene Kits, as well as the renovation of Balochistan’s Forensic Science Lab. Furthermore, four Forensic Collection Units to transport evidence were also established.\nThis has been demonstrated by Ms. Jouhaida Hanano, Advisor, Rule of Law and Anti-Corruption Program, UNODC during her presentation on program achievements.\nUNODC also supported the INL Program in the area of policy reforms and provided technical assistance to Balochistan Police Training Branch in needs assessment and analysis for capacity building. Specialized modules were developed, and 5517 officials were trained on multiple policing functions.\nAbdul Khalique Sheikh, Inspector General of Police Balochistan expressed his profound gratitude to the U.S. Embassy’s International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) “Rule of Law” Program in Balochistan.\nHe said, “These wide-reaching initiatives have made a lasting impact in the lives of common citizens.\nThis program was a perfect arrangement where INL and UNODC extended a helping hand in areas not taken care of by government finances and beneficiaries.\nI would like to acknowledge and appreciate the successful completion of this five-year program in Balochistan.\nThis has set the stage and created an enabling environment where we have further built on it by adding community policing initiative.”\nHe also conveyed his appreciation towards INL and UNODC for their invariable support and further stated that he was confident that this assistance and effort will go a long way in making Balochistan Police more responsive.",
