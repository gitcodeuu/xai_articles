He added, “I look forward to a renewed commitment to reforms in Balochistan, as it continues, building on the success harvested so far. As it ventures forward, more lessons and good practices will inform our policy and practice of the rule of law”.\nThe intensive sessions were held in collaboration with Home & Tribal Affairs Balochistan on January 9-11, 2023. The consultations kicked off with the Home Department, Law and Parliamentary Affairs Department of Balochistan, Police and Levies. It was followed by a consultation with the Reclamation and Probation Directorate Balochistan, Prisons and Prosecution, and concluded with Women Development Department, Balochistan Commission on Status of Women, Social Welfare Department, Bar, Judiciary and civil society. The Delivery Unit, UNDP and UN Women also attended these sessions.\nPrior to the consultations, customized set of questionnaires were circulated among RoL institutions to recommend strategic priorities for the next phase of reforms besides listing key issues and challenges faced during the implementation of the previous Roadmap. The data was duly compiled, distilled, and analyzed before its triangulation for meaningful insights that helped inform the formulation of different sections of the revised Roadmap. All the valuable feedback and input received from key RoL stakeholders including notable successes, lessons learned, and recommendations have informed the formulation of an evidence-base revised ‘RoL Roadmap’.\nThe first Rule of Law Roadmap (RoLR) of Balochistan was developed for the period of, May 2018 – May 2022, as a four-year citizen-centric, result-oriented, and evidence-informed rule of law reform document. The RoLR was developed by applying a participatory and inclusive approach including all of the Criminal Justice System Institutions (CJIs) of Balochistan province in addition to Bar, CSOs, academia, and parliamentarians.",
