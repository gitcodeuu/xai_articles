The committee should thoroughly investigate current state of affairs, in addition to probing reasons of current economic woes.\nHe said former Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was handed down death sentence by a member of Hamood-ur-Rehman Commission Anwaar-ul- Haq while former President Pervez Musharraf was not questioned about his unconstitutionalacts.\nHe said the government had a smooth running in 2017, when former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was disqualified.\nEarlier, Irfan Siddiqui pointed out the issue of his moved bill – Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Bill 2021 already passed by Senate and the National Assembly and the Senate Chairman directed Senate Secretary to look into the matter.",
