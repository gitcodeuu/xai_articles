The ministry renewed Saudi Arabia’s position, which has strongly rejected all these blatant acts, repeated in many European capitals recently, under the pretext of freedom of expression, without a clear reaction towards stopping these practices.\nIt stressed the Kingdom’s demand of all European governments, in which these extremist violations took place, to urgently combat all these practices fueling hatred and conflict among the followers of religions.",
