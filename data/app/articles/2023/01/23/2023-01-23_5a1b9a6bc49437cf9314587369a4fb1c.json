We are investigating the issue and will keep this space posted,” K-Electric spokesperson Imran Rana said.\nThe IESCO spokesperson said that its 117 gird stations were without electricity. No reason was intimated by the regional control centres so far for the power breakdown, he said. The IESCO administration was in continuous touch with the relevant quarters in that regard, he said.\nAccording to Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO), the two transmission lines from Guddu to Quetta tripped. It added that 22 districts of Balochistan, including Quetta, were without power.\nMeanwhile, taking to a private channel, Minister for Power Division Engineer Khurram Dastgir said that the breakdown was not “major”. “In winter, the demand for electricity reduces nationwide, hence, as an economic measure, we temporarily close down our power generation systems at night.\n“However, when the systems were turned on in the morning today, frequency variation and voltage fluctuation was observed in the south of the country- somewhere between Dadu and Jamshoro because of which power generating units shut down one by one,” he said.\nThe minister said that the restoration of grid stations in Peshawar and Islamabad had begun. “I can assure you that power will be fully restored across the country within the next 12 hours,” he added.\nMeanwhile, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) has taken serious notice of the country-wide power breakdown.\nThe authority also directed the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) to submit a detailed report on the electricity blackout.\nNepra also apprised that it had previously imposed fines on similar trippings, partial/full blackout(s), system collapse(s), and tower collapse(s) in 2021 and 2022 and has consistently issued directives and recommendations on mitigating such events as well.",
