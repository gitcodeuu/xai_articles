He said it rejected all forms of terrorism, bigotry, hatred and intolerance.\n“The elements who harm innocent people, women and children in the name of religion have nothing to do with humanity,” he added.\nThe secretary said the state formed in the name of Islam was facing many internal and external challenges.\nThe religion of Islam and the Constitution guaranteed the protection of life, property and honor of all minorities, he added.\nHe said that there was no example in the history of Islam of using the jurisprudential and academic differences of ‘Masalik’ for sectarianism.\nHe urged the administrators of mass media, mosques, schools, and madras to play their role in promoting the ‘Message of Pakistan’ for the promotion of social harmony.",
