There is a need to take bold steps for addressing water scarcity prevailing across the country. We need to build joint commitments to science-based action on water security across policy, development, business, and science constituencies for greater water security.”\nDr. Mark Smith, Director General, IWMI through his video message, introduced the Transformative Futures for Water Security (TFWS) Initiative led by IWMI, its rationale and the need for ensuring water security in the region\nAccording to Dr. Smith, “The latest IPCC report’s message on climate change and water are obvious, that climate change is intensifying hydrological water cycle which means an increase in water risks and extreme floods and droughts. Behind our initiative is an underlying question of who to lead this bold step towards water security.\nThe answer to it is that the youth, policymakers, business, communities, farmers, conservation organizations, and sectors beyond water will lead this action.”Dr. Muhammad Ashraf, Chairman PCRWR said, “Pakistan will face a 30 percent water shortfall by 2030 whereas at present over 60 percent population in the country is drinking unclean water.\nWe are facing groundwater depletion in Islamabad at one meter/annum, as groundwater is helping meet our requirements by 60 percent in agriculture, 90 percent for drinking purposes and by 100 percent for the industry. The situation needs to be immediately addressed.”\nSimi Kamal, Board Member, IWMI, said that water security needed to be looked at from the perspective of how water is used, as up to 90 percent of our water resources are used in agriculture.\nShe said that the youth were technology savvy, entrepreneurial, understanding of the audience, eager to study and learn new things and work hard to change the world. She further said, “Group action for water is political and is needed not based on elite groups’ interest but on the survival of climate change affected communities.”\nThe consultation was followed by the formation of five working groups to discuss multifaceted issues on water security that provided key indicators and suggestions to address the issue with a systematic approach guided by ground realities and scientific evidence to deal with the climate shocks.",
