  "content": "Women’s integration in the public sphere continues to be challenging despite laudable progress on important indices e.g., in higher percentages of women in higher education and civil service. Although the policies strive to be gender inclusive, translating them into projects and concrete deliverables is difficult. Women’s economic empowerment is complex especially when the economy is under pressure. Women producers and entrepreneurs in Pakistan face wide-ranging and complex challenges in accessing markets and expanding their businesses.\nThe objective of the training was to provide clarity on the application of anti-sexual harassment laws to ensure safe workplaces for equal participation, deliver solutions on how to integrate gender into development policies, based on good practices.
