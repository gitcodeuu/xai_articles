Orders had been issued to reduce electricity consumption by 30% in all ministries and divisions, he added.\nCriticizing the previous government led by Imran Khan, the federal minister said that the PTI was responsible for the reduction in the production of wheat and sugar, which was a major reason for the price hike in consumable commodities.\nThe worst floods destroyed standing crops and infrastructure, which further contributed to inflation, he added.",
