The court said that the top court had already ordered in another case that the term of disable wouldn’t be used for special persons.\nThe court said that the constitution of Pakistan ensured rights to all citizens without any discrimination. It said that according to the international reports, the special persons hanged back in life due to negative social attitudes and difficulties in access to the offices.\nIt further said that minorities were three percent of the total population of the country. The minorities were also given representation in the national flag.\nThe court stated that Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah also had been stressing on the protection of minorities’ rights.
