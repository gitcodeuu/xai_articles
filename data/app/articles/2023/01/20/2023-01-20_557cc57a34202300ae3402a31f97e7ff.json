Besides, a separate LCD will be installed on each seat ofthe AC Parlor to let passengers enjoy favourite videos through headphones,” he added.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that the Green Line Train had been scheduled to start operations on December 20 last but due to some financial and other issues now it would start operations in mid-January.\nTo a question, he said Pakistan Railways was also going to expedite improvement in services of the passenger trains as well as at the major railway stations by involving the private sector which would help address growing issues, especially related to cleanliness.\n“The department was of the view that the cleanliness-related services in trains and at major stations, including Lahore, Faisalabad, Karachi, Rawalpindi, Quetta, Peshawar, Khanewal, Sukkur, Sahiwal, Multan, and Bahawalpur were not satisfactory,” he added.\nHe said that if services of the private sector were hired under a fast-track policy, the hygiene conditions at stations and in trains could be improved which would also restore the confidence of passengers in the department.\nThe official said the minister also asked the officials to accelerate efforts to bring uniformity in the design and signboards of stalls at the major railway stations under a policy.\nThe official said that the government was taking several steps to improve the performance of Pakistan Railways and would provide maximum facilities to the masses.",
