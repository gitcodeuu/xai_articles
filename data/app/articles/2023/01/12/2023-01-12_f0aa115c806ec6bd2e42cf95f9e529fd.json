  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 12 (APP): Chief Justice of Pakistan Umar Ata Bandial on Thursday stressed the need of taking steps to reduce expenditures as the country was facing financial difficulties.\nThe CJP observed that all the record of donors of the dams fund was available on the Supreme Court’s website, and the people would be informed about the machinery purchased from it.\nThey would ensure that the dams fund would not be spent on coping with the flood damages, he added.\nThe chief justice remarked that transmission lines were very important for the projects.\nHe was heading a five-member larger bench, which heard a case regarding the construction of Diamer-Bhasha and Mohmand dams.\nDuring the hearing, the counsel of State Bank told the court that total Rs 10 billion was received in the the dams fund, which would increase to Rs 17 billion during the current month due to its investment in government securities.\n“No one had ever withdrawn the money and there is over Rs 16 billion amount present in the dams fund at the moment,” he added. The collected amount was first invested in the government securities and then its proceeds were reinvested in T-bills through the National Bank.\nThe Secretary Water and Power told the court that the instructions had been given to release Rs 2.4 billion for the installation of transmission lines for the dam. The current circular debt in the country was Rs 2.6 trillion and it was expected to further increase, he added.\nHe said over 90% of electricity was being stolen at some grid stations. The Quetta Electric Supply Company (QESCO) supplied electricity worth Rs 95 billion last year but collected only Rs 25 billion, he added.\nHe said electricity was being stolen through hooks and even distribution companies’ (Discos) employees were also involved in the power theft. Half-hearted actions were taken against the power thieves, he added.\nIf such was the situation of Discos then why the same were not privatised as both the government and the International Monetary Fund were concerned about the increasing circular debt, he added.\nThe Secretary Power said now there was less raise in the circular debt due to raise in electricity prices. There was an annual shortfall of Rs 400 billion in the sale and purchase of electricity, he added.\nThe WAPDA’s lawyer told the court that the Power Division had to pay 240 billion in line losses to the Central Power Purchasing Agency (CPPA). The work of the dams project was affected due to non-payment to the contractors, and also due to floods and security situation, he added.\nHe said the infrastructure of Mohmand Dam was damaged and lack of funds was also hindering the dams projects as the amount allocated in the PSDP was also not being released.\nHe said the international experts had left the country due to COVID-19 outbreak.\nJustice Ijaz ul Ahsan instructed the Secretary Power to ensure that dams project should not be affected for any reason.\nThe court directed the Auditor General of Pakistan to review all the records of SC dam funds in coordination with the SBP.\nThe case was then adjourned for an indefinite period.",
