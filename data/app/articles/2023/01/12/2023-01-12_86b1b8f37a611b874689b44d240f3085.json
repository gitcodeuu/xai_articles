He cited the references of articles of Islamic scholars and American magazines, and said the court had to view the matter in the limits of law as everything was clear in Schedule-4.\nHe said things could not be settled on the basis of likes and dislikes of anyone. The court would also have to view whether anyone had crossed the red line, he added.\nJustice Ijazul Ahsan remarked that the court could interfere if there was an illegal act. The lawyer said that then the petitioner had to prove the illegality of NAB law amendments.\nThe CJP remarked that the court had to view the constitutional limits.\nThe case was then adjourned till January 17.",
