The petitioner had given references of the verdicts of the top court and claimed that the PAC’s jurisdiction was only related to the financial affairs, he said.\nAdditional Attorney General Munawar Dogal said that in his opinion, this matter should be sent to the Parliament. The court said that the PAC had restored the employees of the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council and the top court had declared that this was not the authority of PAC.\nThe Chief Justice remarked that the question was that whether the PAC could hear the matter of harassment. If this was so then it could also hear the murder case, he observed.\nThe Chief Justice further remarked that the Parliament’s responsibility was legislation and the courts’ job was to interpret the laws. The PAC should have send the matter to relevant forum if it had received any complaint, he said.\nThe court sought arguments from the lawyer of PAC on next hearing and adjourned the case till February 24.",
