  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 27 (APP): Convener of the World Minorities Alliance (WMA) Julius Salik on Friday strongly condemned the incidents of desecration of the Holy Quran in Sweden and the Netherlands, and demanded the United Nation’s proactive role to address the issue to avert an international crisis.\nThe veteran human rights defender, in a telephonic conversation with APP from Washington, United States, expressed his regret and remorse over the issue.\nJ Salik, who is also a former federal minister, said, “I have been indicating this issue across the world for the past four decades. I have been advocating that the UN has failed to implement its responsibilities. In the Second World there was a loss of almost 50 million lives due to the failure of the Nations League, a world body that was working prior to the establishment of the UN in 1946.\n“We are at the brink of the Third World War, and if the UN failed to implement its role then it may lead to a serious disaster,” he feared.\nThe UN, he said, was not focusing on its efforts to ensure minorities’ rights the world over. “The desecration of Holy Quran in Sweden is highly regrettable and I call that man a cursed person.”\nJ Salik underlined that the respect of different faiths and minorities’ rights was important as all religions educated and preached the message of respect and tolerance for other religions and faiths.\n“In Islam, the Charter of Madina is the biggest accord of its time that promotes tolerance and coexistence among different faiths and Bible also educates this message,” the veteran rights defender said.\n“The UN is not building pressure on these states involved in defilement of the Holy Quran to ensure the right of minorities which is the major cause of its failure and the WMA is working for this cause around the globe,” he added.\nHe suggested that for achieving the goal of peace the Archbishop of Canterbury and Imam-e-Ka’aba should lead the drive to start a social boycott of such states, whereas the UN should support a world over social boycott and no aid should be given to those states involved in the regrettable attempt.\n“Peace is possible with interfaith harmony and respect for others’ faiths and religions.”\nJ Salik said he was going to organize an interfaith conference through the platform of WMA in Washington on the cause to emphasise on the remedies to such incidents that were instigating violence among minorities of different faiths.\n“If the UN did not pay attention to these incidents then it will further escalate. It’s not an ordinary issue and the UN should settle this issue in the International Court of Justice,” he added.\nJ Salik concluded that all forums across the world should strictly condemn the despicable act as the best way was to respect each others’ faith for a peaceful world.",
