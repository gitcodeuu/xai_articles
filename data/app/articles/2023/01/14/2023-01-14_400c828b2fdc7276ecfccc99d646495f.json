Political parties should take responsibility for taking the country forward, he stressed.He told that he talked to Finance Minister Ishaq Dar about the need to hold elections.The current establishment wanted to stay away from politics, he remarked.He expressed confidence that Pakistan would not default economically. He noted that the biggest issue for Pakistan at the moment was its economy.He said no “red line” could be imposed on a politician who was linked to the people of Pakistan.He said members of PTI resigned from the National Assembly but their resignations were not accepted.He said it should be ensured that the next elections in Pakistan were free and fair.“I tried my best for use of electronic voting machines in the polls and for giving voting rights to the overseas Pakistanis,” he concluded.",
