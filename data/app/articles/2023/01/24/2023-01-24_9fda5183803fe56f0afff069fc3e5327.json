It declares its full and unconditional cooperation with the armed forces and other security agencies of Pakistan, he added.\nDr Qibla said this gathering renews the Paigham-e-Pakistan and reiterates its pledge that the armed groups who are engaged in activities against the state in the name of linguistic, regional, religious and sectarian identities, all of them are opposing Shariah orders.\nHe said it is necessary to take full action against all these groups after which they cannot raise their heads again.He said the method of imposing one’s ideas on others by force is a violation of the laws of Shariah and as well as a serious violation of the Constitution and laws of Pakistan. It is a crime, so this type of behavior should be countered at all levels and strategic, proactive, defensive, social and economic measures should be taken to counter them, he added.\nHe said the extortion by terrorist and sectarian organizations in the name of so-called Jihad is a serious violation of Shariah and law and a heinous crime,therefore peace-keeping agencies should make adequate efforts against these crimes.\nHe said the main purpose of all educational institutions established in the country is education and training. All public and private educational institutions of the country should not have anything to do with militancy, hatred, extremism, violence and regionalism, he added.\nHe said after the release of Paigham-e-Pakistan, there has been a significant improvement in this regard and now the situation of peace and order in educational institutions is better and efforts should be continued.\nDr Qibla said the mindset of terrorism and hatred is the enemy of our social peace. Intellectual struggle against this trend is the national responsibility of all institutions and individuals, he added.\nHe said according to Islamic teachings and the country’s law, writing and speech based on insulting, hating and accusing any person, religion or institution is un-Islamic and illegal. Action must be taken against those who commit this crime, he added.\nHe said the jurisprudence and theoretical studies based on arguments are and will remain a part of our religious and Islamic knowledge capital, but these are the subjects of education and research.\nHe said some so-called Ulema in other countries have given such statements in support of the narratives and actions ofterrorist organizations active against Pakistan and its security agencies which are a clear violation of Shariah rules and international law, so this gathering of Pakistani scholars and Ulema not only condemns this irresponsible act but also demands legal action against them.\nHe said a few days ago, the religious sentiments of one and a half billion Muslims around the world have been hurt by the heinous and shameful act of desecration of the Holy Quran by a right-wing extremist in Sweden, which words are not enough to condemn.\nThe freedom to hurt the religious sentiments of Muslims cannot be given under the guise of freedom of expression, he said adding the government of Pakistan and human rights’ leaders should do their responsibility to prevent such hateful act.\nDue to the illegal and unethical use of social media, our social values have been seriously threatened, therefore the use of social media to promote anti-patriotism, sectarianism, violence, hatred and terrorism should be discouraged, he said adding that the general public, especially the youth should be trained on the responsible use of social media through activities related to the Paigham-e-Paistan.",
