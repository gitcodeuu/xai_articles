The petitioner adopted the stance that it had purchased the land against Rs35,000 per marla but the PHC had increased the price to Rs70,000.\nThe chief justice remarked that the NHA had purchased the land in 2006 but had yet to pay the money to the people. He remarked that compensation for forcibly depriving the citizen from their lands couldn’t be made even after paying the money.\nThe CJP remarked that the affectees of Mangla and Tarbela were shifted to Lodhran where the whole families were separated from each other.\nJustice Athar Minallah remarked that the graves of forefathers were also important in our family system and making the people distance themselves from this was also meanness.\nThe court directed the NHA to pay the compensations to the land owners and upheld the verdict of the Peshawar High Court.",
