These measures are in addition to efforts aimed at increasing telecom accessibility, availability, and affordability through telecom operators.\nAccording to the report, PTA is focusing on national telecom equipment standards, outside plant code, in-building cabling standards, and the use of the utility infrastructure to save costs. The regulator also believes that active infrastructure and spectrum sharing needed to be implemented to help pave way for the introduction of new technologies and facilitate the 5G launch.\nMoving forward, PTA will continue to provide an enabling environment for the availability of high-quality telecom services and infrastructure across the country in a bid to bridge the digital divide.",
