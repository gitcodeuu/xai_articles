He prayed to Almighty Allah to rest the departed soul in eternal peace and grant courage to the bereaved family members to bear this irreparable loss with fortitude.\nHe said the worsening law and order situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa was alarming. “If the KP government had focused on peace instead of political manipulation, this situation would not have happened,” he added.\nThe Peshawar High Court Bar incident was proof of the serious law and order situation and those who committed the heinous crime should be punished according to the law, he added.\nThe minister said two lawyers were targeted in Rawalpindi and Peshawar in one day and both cities, where the sad incidents took place, were being ruled by the PTI government.\nHe said the federal government had informed both KP and Punjab several times before to improve the law and order situation.\nThe minister said Afridi was a strong supporter of democracy and a staunch opponent of extremism. Speaking the truth bravely and courageously was his style, Rana Sanaullah said and prayed to Almighty Allah to grant the deceased a high rank in Jannah.",
