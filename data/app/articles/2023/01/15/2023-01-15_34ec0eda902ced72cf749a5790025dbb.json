He also mentioned that Pakistan’s superior strategy and decisive leadership had humbled India during ‘Post-Pulwama Crisis’ in February 2019, when ‘we had 8 Indian aircraft within our grip, with electronic warfare tracking their every move and we have could have taught them a bigger lesson, but we didn’t want to escalate’.\nPresiding over the meeting, NPT Senior Vice Chairman, Mian Farooq Altaf, talked about various attributes of the Quaid e Azam’s leadership, his impeccable integrity and his honesty, and his uncompromising stand on Pakistan, adding ‘the Quaid gave all his property to educational institutions and his family derived no benefit from the creation of Pakistan’.
