We are still in silos because the multilateral system is not able to overcome the nationalisms that rise up every time there is a threat,” she said.\nMinister Rehman said that moral imperative only is not enough, and there is a need for a system with clear incentives and penalties as the current system is not working.\nSenator Sherry Rehman met with the CEO and Co-founder of Planet Labs, Will Marshall.\nThey discussed the role of space technologies, such as satellites, can lead to several inventions that can benefit the environment, as well as role of metrological satellites as early warning systems to predict extreme weather conditions like unprecedented rains, droughts, and floods.\nThe Minister also joined Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Hina Rabbani Khar in a meeting with the Chairman of the World Economic Forum, Professor Klaus Schwab, on the sidelines where they discussed Pakistan’s long-standing relationship with the World Economic Forum and promoting international cooperation.\nSenator Rehman will be in Davos until 20th January 2023 during which time she will meet with political leaders, corporate executives, international organizations, climate action practitioners, media and plenary forums on climate, environmental, economic and social issues.",
