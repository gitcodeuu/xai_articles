They did not return to their country and had now occupied transport business in Pakistan, he added.\nHe said Afghan authorities had already committed in Doha agreement that their land would not be used against Pakistan.\nThe minister said Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PML-N) brought the country on path of progress, prosperity and peace in its tenure by eliminating terrorism from the country.\nHe criticised Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan for portraying negative picture of the country.",
