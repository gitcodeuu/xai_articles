  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 5 (APP): Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch on Thursday said that at the “International Conference on Climate Resilient Pakistan” in Geneva on January 9, Pakistan would present Resilient Recovery, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Framework (4RF) to guide as a strategic policy and prioritization document.\n“4RF is a strategic policy and prioritization document of the Government of Pakistan that will guide the recovery, rehabilitation and reconstruction after the recent devastating floods in a climate-resilient manner. It draws from the findings of the Post Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA) and presents sequenced priorities across sectors around four strategic objectives,” the spokesperson said in her weekly press briefing.\nShe said the 4RF document presented a policy framework, a financing strategy, and implementation and monitoring arrangements. It also includes institutional arrangements for its implementation in an open, transparent and collaborative manner with the support of development partners, she added.\nTo be co-chaired by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and the UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the event would feature a high-level opening segment, where leaders will make supportive statements.\nIn his remarks at the conference, the prime minister will outline Pakistan’s vision for rehabilitation and reconstruction in a climate-resilient manner.\nShe said the conference would be a demonstration of the international community’s continued support for the flood-affected people of Pakistan.\nReferring to the series of baseless and frivolous accusations made against Pakistan by the Indian External Affairs Minister, the spokesperson said the remarks once again reflected India’s growing frustration over its failure to malign and isolate Pakistan.\nFor a country that has a grandiose vision about itself and its place in the world, India’s obsession with Pakistan is unfathomable and absurd…India’s continued anti-Pakistan diatribe cannot hide its brazen involvement in fomenting terrorism on Pakistan’s soil; nor can it conceal the reality of state-sponsored terrorism in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK),” the spokesperson remarked.\nShe said instead of pointing fingers at others, India should end its involvement in terrorism, subversion and espionage against Pakistan.\nShe said on the first of January, Pakistan and India exchanged lists of nuclear installations and facilities as well as the lists of prisoners in each other’s custody.\nHighlighting the human rights violations in the IIOJK during 2022, the spokesperson said that the Indian forces reportedly killed 214 Kashmiris; 57 of them in custody or in fake encounters.\n“Only last week, four individuals were killed in a fake encounter in Sidhra town in Jammu. There are reports that bodies were charred beyond recognition. We call upon the international human rights machinery and organizations to take note of this tragedy.”\nAccording to available accounts, over 4,000 Kashmiris remain imprisoned in different jails of IIOJK and India.\nShe said the political prisoners and human rights defenders continued to be targeted and incarcerated. Resistance leaders, including APHC Chairman Masarrat Aalam Bhat, Muhammad Yasin Malik, Shabbir Ahmed Shah, Nayeem Ahmed Khan, Aasiya Andrabi; and prominent human rights defender, Khurrum Parvaiz continued to remain in detention in fake cases.\nIn 2002, Kashmiris were also prevented from exercising their right to freedom of religion and of assembly as the Indian authorities repeatedly prohibited religious gatherings and Friday prayers in IIOJK.\n“It is especially important to remember these facts as we observe the Right to Self-Determination Day for the people of Jammu and Kashmir.”\nShe said regrettably, the oppressed people of IIOJK have not been able to exercise this right. This day reminds the international community, especially the United Nations, of the imperative of honoring its commitment made 74 years ago towards the people of Jammu and Kashmir and supporting their struggle for self-determination.\n“Pakistan will continue to extend unstinted moral, political and diplomatic support to the people of Jammu and Kashmir in their quest for self-determination in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions,” she added.",
