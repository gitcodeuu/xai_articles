Referring to India’s dangerous designs in the region the president mentioned that India was hellbent on changing the region’s demography and bringing a Hindu Chief Minister on the same pattern as Israel did in Palestine.\nRegarding the Indian rulers’ policy of deceit and deception, he said India itself went to the United Nations but later on backtracked from the commitments it made at the world forum. “Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru himself said in the Security Council that the future of Kashmir will be decided by none but the people of the State”.\nHe said that the United Nations should implement its resolutions so that the people of Kashmir could decide their future peacefully.\nThe AJK president said that the youth should be given more information about Kashmir in order to educate the new generation.",
