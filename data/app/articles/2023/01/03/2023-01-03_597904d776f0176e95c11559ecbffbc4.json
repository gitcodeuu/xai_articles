  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 03 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi on Tuesday expressed his displeasure over callous and heartless act of the Federal Urdu University of Arts, Science and Technology (FUUAST) to withhold the issuance of a transcript and degree to a BBA student due to procedural hiccups between the university and Pakistan Bait-ul-Mal (PBM).\nWhile rejecting the representation against the decision of the Wafaqi Mohtasib (WM), the president directed PBM to redress the grievances of the aggrieved student.\nHe directed FUUAST to issue the degree and transcript to the student within 15 days.\nThe president observed that the university was well aware that the student was pursuing his education on a need-based scholarship under the Ehsaas Scholarship Programme paid by PBM directly to the University.\nBut instead of resolving the late fees payment issue with PBM, the FUUAST unfairly and unjustly withheld the issuance of degree and transcript to the student who had no role in the payment of fees.\nPresident Alvi upheld the Wafaqi Mohtasib order wherein the Mohtasib had remitted the impugned matter to the PBM chairman for its resolution directly with FUUAST and notwithstanding its resolution, issue the transcript and BBA degree to the aggrieved student.\nAs per details, student Abad-ur-Rehman (the complainant) had preferred an appeal seeking interference of WM for issuance of the BBA degree and transcript which was withheld by FUUAST due to non-payment of outstanding dues of Rs 122,500 which was payable by PBM directly to the FUUAST without any involvement of the student.\nWafaqi Mohtasib passed the order in favour of the student. The PBM, however, preferred a representation before the president against the WM’s order, which was rejected by the president.",
