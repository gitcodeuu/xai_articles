  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 03 (APP): The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday allowed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) to continue proceeding against former prime minister Imran Khan, Asad Umar and Chaudhry Fawad Hussain in cases related to the contempt of the institution.\nThe top court also instructed the ECP to take a decision on the objections of Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) as per the law.\nIt said that no high court of the country had stopped the ECP from continuing its proceeding. The high courts of Sindh and Lahore had only stopped the ECP from issuance of the final decision.\nThe order further stated that the Election Act 2017 empowered the ECP for such proceedings. The PTI had challenged the powers of the ECP.\nThe orders were passed by a three-member SC bench, headed by Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial and comprising Justice Athar Minallah and Justice Ayesha A Malik.\nIt may be mentioned here that the ECP had challenged the stay orders of the high court before the SC. The ECP had issued contempt notices during August and September last to Imran Khan and others for allegedly using ‘intemperate’ language against the chief election commissioner.\nThe ECP had directed them to appear before it in person or through their lawyers to explain their position.\nHowever, instead of appearing before the ECP, the PTI leaders challenged the powers of the electoral body before various high courts.",
