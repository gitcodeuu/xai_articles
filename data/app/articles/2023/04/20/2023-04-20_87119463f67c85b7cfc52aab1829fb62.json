The participants also agreed to finalize modalities in this regard.\nThe meeting reiterated that the ruling parties not only believed in the Constitution, democracy and the people’s constitutional right to vote, but also in conducting the election simultaneously across the country.\nIt was noted that consultations and negotiations were already underway among the coalition parties for holding election and the prime minister had already formed a committee for the purpose.\nThe meetings with PPP Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, PDM Chief Maulana Fazlur Rehman and Jammat-e-Islami Emir Sirajul Haq were also held as part of this process.\n“As politicians, we have never closed the doors for holding dialogue with anyone, nor any democrat can do that,” the meeting resolved.\nAt every stage whether it was pertaining to the offer of the charter of economy or others, the coalition government had expressed its willingness to negotiate meaningfully, seriously and within constitutional limits.\nThe meeting said it was the fundamental requirement of the Constitution to hold election in a free, fair and transparent manner.\nIt was reiterated that all the requirements for holding election should be fulfilled so that all parties could accept its results and there would be no political instability in the country in its aftermath which, otherwise, might cause irreparable damage to the economic and national interests.",
