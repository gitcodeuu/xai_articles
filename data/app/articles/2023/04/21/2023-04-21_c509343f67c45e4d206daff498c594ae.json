He was a great representative of the Muslims of the Subcontinent and one of the main exponents of the Pakistan Movement.\nAllama Iqbal was a great visionary poet, who conceived the idea of a separate homeland for the Muslims of the Sub-continent, which was ultimately materialized in the shape of Pakistan.\nHe died on 21 April 1938 in Lahore, Punjab, British India.\nSpeaker National Assembly Raja Pervez Ashraf has said that the Muslim Ummah can cope with the present-day challenges by acting upon the teachings of Allama Iqbal.\nIn his message on the death anniversary of Allama Iqbal, he said Iqbal, through his poetry, awakened the Muslim Ummah from slumber.\nThe Speaker said Allama Iqbal was the proponent of unity amongst Muslims and he taught them to rely on their resources and strength.\nHe said the death anniversary of Allama Iqbal provides an opportunity for Muslims to reflect upon his ideology and teachings.\nIn his message, Deputy Speaker Zahid Akram Durrani said the poetry of Allama Iqbal is a beacon of light for all humans.  He said we can steer the Muslims Ummah especially Pakistan out of current crises by following his teachings.\nFollowing his BA and MA from Government College, Lahore, Iqbal was appointed a professor at the same institution, and after some time, in 1905, he was selected for higher studies at the University of London, and then he moved to Munich, Germany, to pursue a PhD.\nAfter finishing his studies, Iqbal decided to return to India and teach as well as practice law.\nAfter his death, he was designated as Pakistan’s national poet. He is sometimes referred to as the poet of the East. Iqbal’s vision of an autonomous state for Muslims in British India served as the impetus for the creation of Pakistan. Dr Allama Muhammad Iqbal is his given name.\nIqbal was a firm believer in Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s ‘Two Nation Theory,’ which held that Muslims and Hindus were two distinct nations that should be permitted to live separately. He reiterated this theme in his renowned Allahabad Address to the Muslim League in 1930, as well as in his poems and lectures.\nAllama’s speech and beliefs inspired many Muslims, some of whom went on to become leaders of the Muslim League and later fought for Pakistan.\nHe was also quite popular among the Muslim masses. As an influential poet for Muslims in India, Iqbal saw Iqbal Day commemorated across the subcontinent during his lifetime.\nWith his thoughts and poetry, he taught the Muslim youth the lesson of independence, self-sufficiency and greatness.\nThese views were expressed by Engr. Dr. Athar Mahboob, Vice Chancellor of Islamia University Bahawalpur on the occasion of Allama Muhammad Iqbal’s 85th death anniversary being marked on Friday.\nHe said that living nations always remember their heroes and Islamia University Bahawalpur is promoting the thoughtful message of Iqbal.\nThe establishment of the Iqbaliyat department and the launch of BS, MPhil, and PhD Iqbaliyat classes under its management are a link to this chain.\nDr. Athar Mahboob further said that Islamia University Bahawalpur is also taking steps to promote the poetry of Iqbal at the global level, which includes bilateral cooperation agreements with international universities and the establishment of Allama Iqbal Study Centers in various universities.\nOn this occasion, Dr. Muhammad Rafiqul Islam, Chairman of the Department of Iqbal Studies and Philosophy, said that the solution to the problems and afflictions of the Muslim Ummah in the modern era can be easily derived from his thoughts and ideas.",
