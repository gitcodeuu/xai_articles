The re-opening of Khunjarab Pass will help to end the hardships of the people on both sides.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and President Xi Jinping are strengthening Pakistan-China iron brotherhood, she added.\nMaryam Nawaz Sharif also praised the Pakistan-China iron brotherhood and accused the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government of deliberately stalling Pakistan-China trade activities and the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz Supremo and the architect of CPEC, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif started the project with the help of China to boost Pakistan’s development.\nMaryam Nawaz Sharif believes that if the CPEC and Pak-China trade had continued at the pace of the Pakistan Muslim League-N era, the people would not have been miserable today.\nShe emphasized that China-Pakistan relations are the red line of national security and dismissed the baseless allegations of corruption in the projects being run in Pakistan with the cooperation of CPEC and China, which she believes were made by foreign-funded agents to create ‘fitna’.\nThe conspiracy, according to Maryam Nawaz Sharif, has been foiled.\nThe foreign-funded agent [Imran] made baseless allegations of corruption in the projects being run in Pakistan with the cooperation of CPEC and China.",
