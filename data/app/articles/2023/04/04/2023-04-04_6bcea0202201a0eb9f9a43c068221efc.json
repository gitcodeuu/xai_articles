  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 04 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Tuesday said the verdict given by the three-member bench of the Supreme Court was contrary to the judgments of its majority judges.\n“It is an ‘impractical order’ which will further deepen political and constitutional crises,” she said in a series of tweets.\nThe minister said the time and money of the nation would have been saved “if the ‘blue-eyed and impressionist’ (Imran Khan) were directly given control of the Prime Minister’s House.”\nShe said the decision given in the case “which was rejected by the senior judges is ‘unconstitutional’”.\nMarriyum said constitutional matters should not be made issues of ego as, otherwise, it would be detrimental to the country.\nShe said the people were paying the price for a decision which had disqualified the thrice-elected prime minister Nawaz Sharif in 2017 and caused perpetual economic, political and constitutional crises.\n“The facilitation of Imran Khan is not acceptable,” she added.",
