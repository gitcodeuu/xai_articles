The people’s leader was taken away from us through judicial murder, she added.\nShe said that the darkest judgment was a blot on the face of the judiciary, adding, “Through an organized plan, a decision was made against the leader of the people. The role played by our justice system in the killing of the leader of the people makes one bow in shame.”\nFormer President, Asif Ali Zardari filed a reference in 2011 for justice in the judicial killing of Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. “For the last 12 years that reference is buried under files in the High Court,” Sherry Rehman regretted.",
