We should make a pledge on this occasion of Eid that we will carry these qualities of piety, and realisation with us throughout the year and play our role in making society prosperous,” the president remarked.\nHe said as Pakistan currently faces difficult political and economic situation, the people needed to abide by the commandments of Allah Almighty to forgive others if they want Allah to be forgiving to us on the Day of Resurrection.\nHe prayed to Allah Almighty to accept our fasts and prayers during Ramazan and grant the country progress, and prosperity.",
