I think we will be able to offer personalised cancer vaccines against multiple different tumour types to people around the world.”\nHe also said multiple respiratory infections could be covered by a single injection — allowing vulnerable people to be protected against Covid, flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) — while mRNA therapies could be available for rare diseases for which there are currently no drugs, the Guardian reported.\nTherapies based on mRNA work by teaching cells how to make a protein that triggers the body’s immune response against disease.",
