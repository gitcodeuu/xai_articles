During his maiden meeting with the incumbent prime minister, he had talked about the dignity of institutions, the president added.\nTo another question, the president said that the biggest administrative exercise was carried out during the general elections, adding there were two aspects of the ECP; first holding of free and fair elections and second, of making administrative efforts.\nThe president opined that currently, the ECP was being under pressure and cited the independent functioning of an election governing body in the neighbouring country.\nAbout the Supreme Court, the president said that as an institution, it should rise above the occasion.\nHe regretted that the situation had given rise to concerns among the nation. Unanimity and consensus in the apex court would encourage the nation, but the situation had, so far, upset the nation, he added.\nThe president agreed with a question that the Supreme Court was under stress. If an institution was put under stress, it led to breakdown and the country’s judiciary was also facing such stress.\nThe president replied that he had sent the reference against Justice Qazi Faez Isa to the Supreme Judicial Council after applying his mind and forming an opinion as there were certain allegations.\nSo, he adopted the constitutional approach and sent it to appropriate forum because the president office had no powers to investigate it, he emphasized.\nReplying to a query about the current volatile political situation, the president said that he had been trying for months to bring the political leadership to sit together.\nHe said great nations forgave each other and move ahead but here the people and especially politicians were not forgiving, he regretted, adding the purpose of parliament and the system was to negotiate with each other.\nThe president stressed that for the sake of country, all the political forces, especially those at the helms of affairs to forgive each other, reconcile and chart a way forward.\nHe also categorically said that he did not discuss the political issues with the current establishment.\nThe president regretted that the country was confronted with issues of poverty, inflation and dearth of food items while the politicians were trying to save their interests.\nThe president to a question, said that he had sent back the judicial reforms bill back for reconsideration with certain observations.\nWhereas, he said that he had signed all other advices received from the government and only sent back 10 among them.\nAbout the previous government’s policy over terrorism, the president said that a combined policy could handle the issue.\nHe also defended his meetings with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chairman Imran Khan and said that in the past, he had held consultations with the PTI leader regarding appointment of new chief of army staff, so that unanimous consensus could be developed.\nHe also lauded the personnel of armed forces who were sacrificing their lives for the protection of the motherland.",
