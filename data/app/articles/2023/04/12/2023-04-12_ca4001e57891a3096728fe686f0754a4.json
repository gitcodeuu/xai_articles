Information Minister Marriyum Aurangzeb was also present on the occasion.\nRana Sanaullah congratulated the newly-elected committee members and urged them to do their best in curbing artificial inflation.\nHe also asked the members of the market committee to play a role against elements involved in hoarding, profiteering, smuggling and their facilitators.\nInterior Minister said that had the market committee established before the advent of Ramazan, it would have helped a great deal in controlling artificial inflation and profiteering, which would have ultimately given huge relief to the public.\nHowever, he said, “It’s never too late” and the establishment of the committee is welcomed with the hope that it would help act against the elements that are charging exorbitant prices.\nAssistant Commissioner Saddar Zone Sanya Hameed Pasha administered oath to newly-elected Chairman M Sajid Abbasi, Vice Chairman Safdar Siddique, and members Farooq Amjad, Naeem Azam Khan, Tahir Ayub, Agha Siraj, Roshdil Khan, Ajmal Abbasi, and Chaudhry Ilyas.\nThe oath-taking ceremony was attended by MNA Tahira Aurangzeb, and PML-N leaders Hanif Abbasi, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Malik Abrar and others.
