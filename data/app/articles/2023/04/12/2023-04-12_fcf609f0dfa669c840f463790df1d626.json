  "content": "MIRPUR (AJK), Apr 12 (APP): APHC leader Nayeem Ahmed Khan has made a passionate appeal to member countries of Group Twenty (G-20), urging them to refrain from participating in the group’s upcoming events being hosted by India in the UN-recognized disputed territory of Jammu and Kashmir.\nIn a statement issued from the infamous Indian prison on Wednesday, the illegally incarcerated Hurriyat leader, while condemning the Modi government’s crafty move, reminded the members of G-20 that Jammu and Kashmir was an issue that had been on the UNSC’s agenda for more than 70 years.\nTerming the Indian move as a deep-rooted conspiracy to divert world attention away from the real issue, the Hurriat leader said that G-20 members who had a remarkable human rights track record should skip the summit events being held in the disputed region and exert pressure on the government of India to resolve the lingering dispute in line with the UN security council resolutions.\n“It would be a great travesty of justice on the part of G-20 nations to offer India, the usurper of Kashmir, an opportunity to pose as a responsible stakeholder by participating in the leaders’ summit in the territory that it had occupied illegally in brazen violations of international law and norms of justice,” he said, adding that it was high time that the member countries of the group should come clean on the issue and hold India accountable for the massive human rights violations being committed by it’s troops.\nThe leader said that G20 leaders should publicly condemn the Indian government’s crimes against humanity and targeting the innocent Kashmiris in the held territory.\n“Economic interests should not prevent G-20 nations from directly and publicly challenging India over its belligerent policy on Kashmir and rights violations taking place in the region,” he said.\nUrging the G-20 nations to stay away from the summit events being held in the disputed territory, the APHC leader said that by hosting such events, Modi government was trying to portray normalcy in the region.\nHe said that all that the world needs to realize was that the Indian-held territory of Jammu and Kashmir had been classified as the highest militarized zone in the world where humans live without human rights.",
