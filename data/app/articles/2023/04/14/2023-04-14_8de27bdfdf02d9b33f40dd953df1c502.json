They also provided umbrellas and raincoats to help people protect themselves from the rain, he added.\nDr Naif said the rain was seen as a welcome relief by the residents of Makkah, who have been experiencing scorching temperatures in recent weeks.\nHe said the rainfall was also celebrated by the people of Makkah, who believe that rain is a sign of Allah’s mercy. Social media platforms were filled with images and videos of the Kaaba displaying the beautiful scene of rainfall, with people expressing their gratitude and awe at the sight, he added.\nDespite the large amount of rain in some areas, the authorities ensured that the Grand Mosque remained open and accessible to the visitors, he said adding that the cleaning process began as soon as the rain stopped, and the Grand Mosque was ready for the next prayer time.\nDr Naif said the rainfall in Makkah serves as a reminder of the power and majesty of Allah and the significance of rain in Islamic culture.\nHe said the worshippers and residents of Makkah alike were grateful for the much-needed respite from the heat and the spiritual experience brought on by the rain.\nTaking to Twitter, he also shared a video clip of Kaaba showing the scenic view of the centre of Islam.",
