  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 05 (APP): The shrinking delta of the Mighty River Indus of Pakistan has emerged on the United Nations’ radar after it accepted to create a global convention on all deltas of the world to ensure its protection against rising climate change impacts casting serious impact on its nature and habitat.\nThe development occurred after a strong international civil society nexus of experts, academicians, policy makers and stakeholders unanimously raised their voice for an international UN Convention for the Conservation River Delta (UN-CCRD) on the sequel of its UN Human Rights Declaration, UN Geneva Pact and many others to ensure that all the major deltas of the world were dying due to adverse impacts of climate change and environmental degradation namely sea intrusion, sea level rise, droughts, depleting water flows, shrinking creeks and others.\nThe African Centre for Climate Actions and Rural Development Initiative (ACCARD) in collaboration with the Nigeria’s Bayelsa State Government, the Institute for Environmental Diplomacy and Security at the University of Vermont, the Consortium for Capacity Building at the University of Colorado, Transboundary Water In-Cooperation Network (TWIN), Water Environment Forum-Pakistan, Center for the Advancement of Public Action (CAPA) Bennington College; Vietnam National University, Hanoi, Vietnam; and Center for Environment and Sustainable Livelihood Projects (CESLP), among others hosted a side event at the UN Water conference titled “Integrative Highland to Ocean (H2O) Action for Disappearing Deltas: Towards a UN Convention on Conserving River Deltas.\nNisar Memon, former federal minister for information & broadcasting and Chairman of the World Environment Forum, a civil society organization working to protect water resources and environment, participated virtually to represent Pakistan in the sideline event whereas Freeman Elohor Oluowo of ACCARD and Prof Dr Asim Zia, Director, Institute for Environmental Diplomacy, Vermont physically participated in the session.\nThe global convention would help in achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030 namely SDG-6 demanding “Clean Water”, SDG-13 “Climate Action”, and SDG-14 “Conserving and sustainably using the oceans, seas and marine resources”.\nThe announcement about the Indus Delta emerging on the UN radar came after the successful campaign of the above-mentioned coalition of non-governmental and civil society organizations who started the drive for a global convention of the United Nations to protect deltas.\nThe speakers and experts discussed deltas starting from Nigerian Niger Delta, Indus Delta of Pakistan, Mekong River, Colorado, Nile and St. Lawrence transboundary river basins. Each of the deltas possessed varying risks owing to spiking up sea level rise and salt water intrusion from the oceans, and rapidly melting glaciers, increasing dams and shifting rainfall patterns in the highlands.\nThe UN accepted that all the world deltas were under threat and sea level rise and intrusion were causing damage to soil and water ecosystems.\nIt was not only nature but rather the communities, the livelihood opportunities and human lives that were diminishing and demanded the world to respond for their protection.\nThere would be various activities in Delta countries towards achieving the UN Convention for the Conservation River Delta.\nAs per the UN SDGs website, the United Nations Convention for the Conservation River Deltas (UN-CCRD) objectives are to strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity among delta communities and water stakeholders to climate-related hazards and natural disasters through increased knowledge sharing, partnerships, global attention, UN recognition, and community participation. It also aims to build a regional to global stakeholders’ dialogue not only to identify but to also proffer integrative Highlands to Oceans (H2O) solutions to growing water-related challenges particularly those potentiated by climate change. Moreover, to enhance the local capacity of countries through training and capacity building including on community data gathering and community-based context-sensitive solutions to these complex problems.",
