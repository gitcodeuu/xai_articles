  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 05 (APP): The Supreme Court on Wednesday issued a written order for the March 17 hearing indicating the formation of a judicial commission due the lack of progress in the investigation of journalist Arshad Sharif’s murder case.\nThe court order stated that if the court was not satisfied with the investigation, a judicial commission would be constituted.\nOn the previous hearing of the case, former Justice Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, the lawyer of Arshad Sharif’s family, raised objections to the court proceedings and had stated that the Supreme Court could not supervise the JIT’s investigation as the Supreme Court could monitor and investigate matters related to fundamental rights.\nIn its order, the Supreme Court had stated that Additional Attorney General Chaudhry Aamir Rehman informed about mutual legal cooperation and assistance from Kenya and UAE.\nAccording to the additional attorney general, the Kenyan authorities did not respond to mutual legal assistance.\nThe special JIT constituted on court order had been given another three weeks for investigation from foreign countries and it had been stated that since it was an important matter of fundamental rights, the court could form a judicial commission for investigation.\nThe Supreme Court in its written order had further stated that Arshad Sharif’s murder was a matter of fundamental rights apart from the murder of a senior journalist.\nMore than five thousand letters were sent to the Supreme Court to investigate the murder of Arshad Sharif.\nAccording to the order, the Supreme Court wanted a free and fair investigation into Arshad Sharif’s murder.\nFurther hearing of the case would be held in April this month.",
