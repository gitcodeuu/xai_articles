  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 03 (APP): Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Monday said the coalition government was not shying away from contesting the elections but rather taking exceptions of holding separate elections in the provinces (Punjab and KP), adding the said exercise would lead to uncertainty in the country.\nTalking to the media outside the Supreme Court’s building, the federal minister said at present the situation had become controversial.\nSherry stated that the controversy was that ” a minority bench of the Supreme Court was converted into a majority bench and making decisions. The four judges who did not agree with the suo motu proceedings had been excluded from the bench bench”.\nShe said that no one wanted the courts to be “controversial”.\n“If we are not made part of the court proceedings, then how will we hear its proceedings? Only one political party has been made a party in this matter, whereas repeated requests by political parties in this regard have not been accepted,” she added.",
