Whether it was Bajwa who asked Imran Khan to appoint Usman Buzdar and Chaudhary Pervez Elahi as chief executives of Punjab.\nShe said Imran Khan also asserted that he had dissolved assemblies in Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa at the behest of Bajwa.\nThe minister asked the PTI chief what he was doing all the time during the tenure of his government. Whether he just travelled to his residence in Bani Gala by helicopter, which did cost Rs 55 per trip, on his own will.",
