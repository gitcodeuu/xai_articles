  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 19 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Wednesday congratulated the people as well as the doctors over the introduction of robotic surgery in the Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute.\n“Alhamdulillah, the efforts for liver and kidney treatment in Pakistan are coming to the fruition,” the prime minister remarked.\nHe said the purpose of establishing PKLI was to provide the modern facility for treatment of kidney and liver disease within the country.\nAt the PKLI, the world-class liver and kidney treatment facility has been made available in the country. PKLI will become the John Hopkins of Pakistan, he added.\nThe prime minister said that the PKLI could have progressed more if former chief justice Saqib Nisar had not intervened just to get a salary raise for his brother.\nHe hoped that the PKLI would play its role in reducing the mortality ratio and prevention of kidney and liver disease which was on surge in the country. The current mortality ratio of kidney disease stands at 2.77 which needed to be addressed through effective measures.\nThe prime minister resolved that the government would establish the PKLI-like state-of-the-art hospitals in other parts of the country.\nHe said that the previous government had been using the technology to target government institution and political adversaries but the incumbent government used it for the public welfare as provision of education and health facilities was its priority..\nHe said the course of public welfare has been revived which was disrupted in 2018.\nI will not give up the course of public welfare, whatsoever the cost is,” he commented.",
