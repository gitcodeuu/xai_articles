The boundaries of the Haji Camp Lahore had already been completed, he added.\nHe said a solar tube well was also being erected in the Haji Camp Quetta with the estimated cost of Rs 15 million in the one year’s tenure.\nThe meeting under the chairmanship of religious affairs secretary was attended by the representatives of finance and planning divisions, PWD, Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Council for Islamic Ideology (CII) and Pakistan Environment Protection Agency.\nThe religious affairs ministry’s Development and Coordination Department exclusively briefed the meeting over all the aspects of the following schemes.It is pertinent to mention here that the Senate Standing Committee on Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony and CII had already approved the establishment of sacred papers recycling plant unanimously.\nThe process of recycling would include pulping, deinking and new paper making. The ink would be removed in a flotation process where air would be blown into the solution. The ink would rise to the surface in adherence to bubbles of air from where it would be separated. After the ink was separated, the fiber may be bleached, usually with hydrogen peroxide, oxygen or chlorine dioxide.",
