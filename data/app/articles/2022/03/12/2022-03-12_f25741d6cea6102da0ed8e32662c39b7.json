With the introduction of PEUGEOT, the company now aims to provide the best mobility solutions the European Brand can offer its customers.\nPEUGEOT is an inventive brand that has been a pioneer in the automotive industry for over 211 years guided by its brand values; Allure, Emotion, and Excellence, which represent sharp design, intuitive driving pleasure, and uncompromising quality. With its entry into Pakistan, these values will be upheld as the brand strives to provide the market with the latest innovations and mobility solutions.\nLinda Jackson, CEO of the PEUGEOT brand, said: “We are delighted with this partnership and what it means for the Pakistani market. This will be the first time a European car is assembled in Pakistan and we are excited to work with Lucky Motors to support employment, localization, and the local automotive industry in the country. Internationalization is a key focus for PEUGEOT, with the B and C segment SUV growth representing a great opportunity for us. This is also bolstered by the evolution of the legislation of the country towards electrification which is in line with our own strategy.”\nSamir Cherfan, Chief Operating Officer, Middle East & Africa Region, Stellantis, said: “We are excited to embark on this journey in Pakistan with our new partner, Lucky Motor Corporation. We see tremendous potential and opportunity for PEUGEOT in Pakistan, and are looking forward to serving customers in this exciting market.”\nAsif Rizvi, Chief Executive Officer, Lucky Motors Company, said: “Lucky Motors is set to change the automotive landscape of Pakistan by introducing Peugeot, the first locally made European brand in the country. We are very excited to partner with Peugeot and look forward to being associated with Stellantis, a company that strongly believes in futuristic mobility solutions.\nPakistan, with its 220 million population, offers a great opportunity for someone to come in and disrupt the automotive market. And we have no doubt that the Stellantis with its 14 brand portfolio, will be the one to do so. Lucky Motors is proud to become the first company in Pakistan to have multi-brand manufacturing and dealers. We are delighted to embark on this adventure, bringing with it the best automotive solutions, while also making meaningful contributions and investments that will support economic and social development in Pakistan.”\nThe first step of this ongoing commitment to the Pakistani customer will begin with the introduction of the PEUGEOT 2008. The lauded 2008 has been a success story for the brand since its development and stands apart in the compact SUV segment with its distinctive design, advanced technology, and efficient power trains.\nIt also benefits from The PEUGEOT i-Cockpit, which features a stimulating interior design along with a state-of-the-art digital cluster and a touch screen that amplifies any driving experience. With 26 international prizes, including the Red Dot Design Award, and its perceived quality and value, 2008 is the perfect model for Pakistani families.\nThe e-2008 will be the next model launched, giving customers the freedom to choose between a 100% electric and a thermic version, thanks to the Multi Energy platform CMP. Together, with support from PEUGEOT, Lucky Motors Corporation will assemble various models locally at state-of-the-art facilities and is currently exploring opportunities to distribute multiple models by early next year.",
