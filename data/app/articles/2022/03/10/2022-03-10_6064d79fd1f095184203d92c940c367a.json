This is beyond cruel, barbaric, and monstrous. Being a father of a girl, I can tell there is nothing more beautiful than having a daughter,” a Twitter user expressed.\nA local renowned poet from Mianwali, Shakir Khan Balach on his Facebook post commented that he was more than happy to adopt a baby-girl whose father could not raise her.\n“For the love of God and his Messenger, do not kill your daughters; give them to me, I will raise them,” Shakir wrote on his Facebook wall and these words were later endorsed and adopted by hundreds of social media users making it a trend.\nCommenting on this compassionate public reaction, a psychologist Farhat Zahra said, “This is the beauty of our society that we do not delay in condemning an individual or individuals’ wrongdoings that may portray a bad image and define the overall approach of a society or a nation.”\nChairperson National Commission on the Rights of Child (NCRC) Afshan Tehseen talking to APP said, to avert these incidents from happening in future there was a need to amend educational courses to inject the true teachings of Islam to the coming generations. She also emphasized on religious leaders and the media’s role terming them as key components to shape up a society’s mindset.\n“We are collaborating with other concerned departments and institutions as well as organizing conferences, talks, webinars, and related events to create awareness about child rights”, she remarked sharing her organization’s efforts in this regards.",
