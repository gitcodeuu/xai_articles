  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 16 (APP): Prime Minister’s Special Representative (PMSR) for Interfaith Harmony and Middle East Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi Wednesday said adopting Pakistan’s resolution and setting March 15 as International Day to combat Islamophobia was a landmark achievement of the country.\nAddressing a press conference here, he thanked the countries which supported Pakistan’s stance in the United Nations (UN) Security Council, adding it was good news for all Muslim Ummah and peace-loving countries across the world.\nThe PMSR, appreciating the unflinching efforts of Prime Minister Imran Khan against the rising tide of Islamophobia in the world, expressed the hope that this peace-building overture would have further positive impacts in the future.\nAshrafi who is also the chairman of Pakistan Ulema Council lamented that it was totally unfair to link Islam with terrorism as it was a religion of peace.\nHe said it was a big honor for the treasury as well as opposition benches that Pakistan was holding Organization of Islamic Cooperation’s foreign ministers summit second time in the period of three months.\nHe informed that foreign delegations would start reaching the federal capital from March 19, almost from 48 countries and remain till March 24.\nAshrafi welcomed the decision of opposition parties particularly Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl Chief Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehamn for understanding the gravity of the situation and postponed his already announced march till the conclusion of the OIC summit.\nHe also urged the media to play a constructive role apart from the politics during the summit days because it was one and only forum of the Muslim Ummah where Muslim countries’ leaders would discuss Kashmir, Palestine and Afghanistan issues besides Islamophoobia and burgeoning extremism in India.\nHe said it was a collective responsibility of all of us to make this historic event a success story.",
