  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 16 (APP): Special Assistant to the Prime Minister for Political Communications Dr Shahbaz Gill on Wednesday while referring to the PML-N said people who, throughout their lives, had been involved in immoral politics were teaching ethics to others.\nResponding to PML-N leader Maryam Aurangzeb’s statement, he said PML-N and PPP leaders Nawaz Sharif and Asif Ali Zardari were far from the standards of morality.\n“Absconders were teaching others the respect for law”, he added.  Gill referring to PML-N, he said those who used government helicopters for personal use were telling others on how to use the government resources.\n“The incompetent league (PML-N) used government resources to expand its personal businesses. PML-N’s ideology is only corruption and the Sharif family had begun politics just to rob the nation’s money,” he said.",
