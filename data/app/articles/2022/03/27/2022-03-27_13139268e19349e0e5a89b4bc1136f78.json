Fawad said the prime minister was not only striving for the welfare of masses but also the entire Muslim Ummah.\nHe said the PTI only wanted to remain in public which brought the party into the government. It had no interest in the power, the minister added.\nHe said those who wanted to oust the prime minister would have to go through from 200 million people who stood behind him like a rock.",
