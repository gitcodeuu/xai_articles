Now March 15 is declared as International Day to Combat Islamophobia just because of Imran Khan’s struggle,” he said.\nAbout the Jalsa, he said there was so much heat and still time left in the public gathering but one can see the masses turning up to the venue with passion and zeal. “Today is the war of every dignified Pakistani against the corrupt. They have to decide whether they want to bow down on ‘Do More’ or stand up for their dignity by saying Absolutely No.”\n“I request all Pakistanis who are coming for all over the country for the Jalsa to reach at the venue as soon as possible. Today, a loud and clear message about the Pakistan’s bright future will be sent,” he said.",
