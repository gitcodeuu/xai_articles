PML-N leadership had done massive corruption and money laundering during their ruling period but now they were expressing themselves as well wisher of the people, he added.\nHe said, the opposition parties were using different tactics for getting relaxations in corruption cases which were registered against their leadership but the government was not ready to make any compromise over the issue of accountability process of the corrupts.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan was the only hope of the people and they were showing full confidence on his honest leadership, he added.The people wanted to get rid of such politicians who were involved in loot and plunder and the plight of poor people could not be changed during 35 years of their regimes.\nThe public sentiment was against the no-confidence move of the opposition parties, he added.On the occasion, Malik Abid Hussain told that the big rallies of the party workers and public from different areas of Rawalpindi city, district and Rawalpindi division would first gather here at Liaquat Bagh on Mar 27 and a grand rally led by provincial, district and city level PTI leaders would move towards Islamabad to participate in PTI’s public meeting.\nHe said that huge number of people would attend PTI March 27 historic public meeting.Malik Abid Hussain informed the meeting that on the special directives of Sadaqat Ali Abbasi, Wasiq Qayyum and other party leaders, the party workers were finalizing all the arrangements to organize grand rallies so that the corrupt elements could be given a message that majority of the people are with Imran Khan and those hatching conspiracies and want to protect their vested interest would not be given any more chance.\nHe said that Imran Khan is the hope of the whole Islamic world which has proved through getting passed a resolution against Islamophobia from the United Nations platform that he deserves the leadership of the Islamic world and could truly represent Pakistan.",
