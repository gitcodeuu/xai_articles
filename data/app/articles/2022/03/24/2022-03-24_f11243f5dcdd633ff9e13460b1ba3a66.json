It was a great event for Pakistan’s diplomacy, he added.\nHe said the meeting took place in the backdrop of conflicts and tensions around the world, persistent denial of justice, and rising inequalities. Therefore, Pakistan’s presentation of an overarching theme: “Partnering for Unity, Justice and Development” meant a realistic appraisal of current challenges and opportunities faced by the Muslim Ummah.\nHe said the CFM once again recognized Pakistan’s leading role in the OIC.\nThis CFM was the 7th high-level OIC meeting convened by Pakistan since the organizations’ establishment in 1969: two summits in February 1974 and March 1997; five CFMs in December 1970, May 1980, April 1993, May 2007, and March 2022, besides three extraordinary sessions.\nIn their statements at the inaugural session, the OIC Secretary-General, Saudi Arabia, Niger, Asian, Arab and African Groups, China and many other delegations in the inaugural session expressed strong expressions of support and solidarity to the people of Kashmir.\nAction Plan by Contact Group and its approval by CFM, presentation of visit reports by OIC Special Envoy on Jammu and Kashmir, IPHRC and ASG for Humanitarian Affairs and endorsement of Pakistan’s position on legal, diplomatic, human rights, humanitarian and peace and security dimensions of the Jammu and Kashmir issue are among other successes of the summit.\nThe summit rejected India’s unilateral and illegal actions since 5 August 2019, and demanded from India to reverse those actions including demographic changes.\nOn CFM sidelines, a ministerial meeting of the OIC Contact Group on J&K was held which adopted a comprehensive Joint Communiqué articulating OIC’s unified position on the human rights, humanitarian, peace and security and legal dimensions of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.\nThe OIC Secretary General’s Special Envoy on Afghanistan presented report to the CFM on progress achieved on decisions reached at the December 2021 Extra-ordinary Meeting.\nThe OIC Humanitarian Trust Fund operationalized during the CFM; Charter of the Fund signed by OIC SG and President of Islamic Development Bank.\nThe session adopted a comprehensive resolution on Islamophobia with substantial inputs by Pakistan.\nWelcoming the unanimous adoption of UN General Assembly proclaiming 15 March as International Day to Combat Islamophobia, the CFM decided to appoint OIC Special Envoy on Islamophobia to lead collective efforts on the organization’s behalf.\nThe participants welcomed the establishment of Rehmatullil Aalameen Authority by Pakistan, lauded Pakistan’s ‘10 Billion Tree Tsunami’ initiative, Prime Minister Imran Khan’s Debt Relief Initiative for developing countries, and its continued support and facilitation to OIC Commission on Science and Technology (COMSTECH).\nThe CFM expressed grave concerns over launch of a supersonic Indian missile into Pakistan on 9 March and endorsed Pakistan’s call for a joint probe into the incident.\nOn COVID-19, the session called for vaccine equity- universal, fair, affordable and timely access to COVID-19 vaccines, and related essential health products, equipment and technologies.\nDuring the preparatory process for the CFM Session, Pakistan was unanimously elected as a Member of the governing bodies of three OIC institutions, namely Islamic Center for Development and Trade, Casablanca, Islamic University of Technology, Dhaka, Statistical, Economic and Social Research and Training Center for the Islamic Countries (SESRIC), Ankara.\nOn Ukraine, the Ministers called for an immediate cessation of hostilities to prevent further loss of life and stressed the need for establishment humanitarian corridors to ensure safe movement of civilians from active conflict zones.",
