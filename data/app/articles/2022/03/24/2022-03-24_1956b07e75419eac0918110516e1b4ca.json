The World Bank in its report also declared that there was lowest unemployment in Pakistan as compared to other countries of the region, he added.\nHe said the incumbent government put the national economy on right track which had left on verge of bankruptcy by PML-N. The minister said large scale manufacturing witnessed over 8 per cent increase while country’s export has reached to $30 billion.\nThe country’s foreign reserves have also been doubled as compared to the tenure of PML-N government, he added. He said it was an old modus operandi of PML-N to make national institutions controversial and then make efforts to take perks from them.",
