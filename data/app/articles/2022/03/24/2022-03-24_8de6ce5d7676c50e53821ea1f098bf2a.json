Senator Fauzia Arshad and former chairman union council Saidpur Raja Sheraz Kiani were also present on the occasion.\nAli Nawaz Awan said both the PML-N leaders Hamza Shehbaz and Shahid Khaqan Abbasi had accepted that transactions were made into the account of Maqsood peon [an employee of Ramzan Sugar Mill], but they had not provided the record of billions of rupees obtained through illegitimate sources. It was the public money which they had laundered abroad, he added.\nHe said it was Prime Minister Imran Khan, who had brought the country out of numerous challenges and put the economy on right track. A public leader always led the nation from the front in difficult times, he added.Ali Nawaz said Saidpur was his second home as its inhabitants had always showed their affection towards him and fulfilled the commitment made with the PTI leadership.\nHe urged the locals to repose confidence in the leadership of Prime Minister Imran Khan by participating in the PTI’s public meeting on March 27 at Parade Ground.",
