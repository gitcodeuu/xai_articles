strongly”.\n“I want to make it clear to the enemy that Pakistan will never compromise on its sovereignty as the nation and its armed forces are ready to thwart any aggression,” he said in his address at the Pakistan Day Parade here at the Parade Avenue, Shakarparian.\nThis year’s annual event attained great significance as the foreign ministers of the 57-member Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) witnessed the joint services parade, where Pakistan showcased its military prowess.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan, cabinet members, diplomats, senior civil and military officials, and prominent figures, who have won accolades for their services to Pakistan, were present.\nPresident Alvi said the expansionist designs of Pakistan’s neighbouring country was a matter of concern for the security and stability of South Asia.\nHe mentioned India’s illegal occupation in Jammu and Kashmir and urged the international community and the United Nations to stop the ongoing human rights violations.\nReferring to the country’s resolve against fighting extremism and terrorism, he said, “The Pakistani nation has made immense sacrifices in the war and stood resilient against internal and external conspiracies.”\nHe lauded the valour and courage of the country’s armed forces and the nation for making their homeland strong and prosperous.\nThe president said the nation and all the state institutions supported the upholding of democracy in the country.\n“We should always keep in view the saying of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah to stand united as a nation, and demonstrate faith and discipline within our ranks,” he said.\nThe president felicitated the nation on the occasion of Pakistan Day and said the day was special in a way that it coincided with the 75th anniversary of the country’s establishment.\nHe paid glowing tribute to the countrymen who laid their lives for the sovereignty of the country and contributed towards its stability.\n“Being a strong and united nation, we vow to keep high the integrity and sovereignty of our motherland,” he said.\nPresident Alvi said the purpose of the creation of Pakistan was to establish a modern Islamic welfare state in line with the vision of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\nOn the two-day 48th OIC’s Council of Foreign Ministers’ moot being hosted by Pakistan, he said as a founding member, Pakistan was committed to the strengthening of the Islamic body.\nHe highlighted that the world was facing several challenges including the issues of Palestine and Kashmir that needed urgent resolution.\nHe pointed out the worldwide rising trend of Islamophobia and mentioned that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and Pakistan made strong efforts against it, which resulted in the passage of a resolution by the United Nations.\nHe expressed satisfaction that March 15 would be marked every year as the day to counter Islamophobia and said the act would help check hatred against Muslims across the world.\nOn Afghanistan, he said the world must take note of the situation where the Afghans were suffering a humanitarian crisis in the shape of hunger and poverty.\nThe president said Pakistan was facing the challenges of extremism, intolerance, fake news, and denial of the rights of women.\nHe appealed to all segments of the society, particularly Ulema (religious scholars), parents, teachers and media to realize their responsibility in that regard.\nHe termed the family system the strength of the nation, as it helped in keeping the social fabric intact.\nHe expressed confidence that the nation would stand undeterred in the journey towards making the country strong and prosperous.\n“This event is the reflection of unity and progress of our nation, and also shows the picture of our military strength,” he said.\nEarlier, President Arif Alvi, Prime Minister Imran Khan, Chief of the Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi, OIC foreign ministers and the guests witnessed the march past of the contingents of tri-services, including Pakistan Army, Navy and Air Force.\nThe contingents of friendly countries, including Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Uzbekistan, Azerbaijan and Bahrain also participated in the parade.\nChief of the Air Staff Air Chief Marshal Zaheer Ahmed Babar Sidhu followed the tradition by leading the fly-past of various formations of Pakistan Air Force fighter aircraft, including the newly acquired J-10C jet.\nThe marching columns of Armour Corps, Artillery, Rangers, Air Defence, Coast Guards, and the women contingent of Armed Forces Nursing Service passed by the dais.\nThe ‘Sherdils’ team of seven Karakoram aircraft presented enthralling aerobatics, leaving a colourful trail of smoke in the blue sky.\nThe paratroopers of the three services made freefall jumps from the altitude of 10,000 feet and precisely landed at their designated targets in the ground.\nThe floats of the provinces depicted their unique culture through artefacts, folk songs and dances in a show of national harmony.
