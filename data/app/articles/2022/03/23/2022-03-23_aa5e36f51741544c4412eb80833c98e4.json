In that action plan we agreed that different member states will meet regularly and coordinate their positions on the Kashmir dispute and monitor the ever deteriorating situation of human rights in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nHopefully our representatives in New York, Geneva and Jeddah will be coordinating and meeting more regularly to highlight the plight of the Kashmiri people.”\nOn the issue of Palestine, Qureshi said Pakistan’s position had been very clear and consistent. “We demonstrated that clarity when in the month of Ramazan last year there was a sad incident at the Al Aqsa mosque.”Pakistan played its role and would continue to play its role for the cause of Palestine, he added.\nHe further said after the last conference of foreign ministers, the OIC succeeded in getting the attention of the international community towards the situation in Afghanistan, and afterwards concessions were made, sanctions were relaxed and humanitarian assistance and different measures were announced to help the Afghan brothers and sisters.\nHe said the OIC ministers expressed concern at the ongoing situation in Ukraine. The OIC demanded that a humanitarian corridor should be ensured in Ukraine to provide relief to the people.\nThe presence of Chinese foreign minister at the conference showed that China wanted to strengthen its relations with the Islamic world, Qureshi noted.\nHe said there was no dearth of human and natural resources in the Muslim world and the need was to work together.The OIC, he said, welcomed the establishment of Rehmatulil Alameen Authority in Pakistan.The conference participants decided to appoint a special representative on the issue of Islamophobia.\nOIC Secretary General Hussein Ibrahim Taha thanked the people and the Government of Pakistan for the excellent arrangements made for the meeting of OIC Foreign Ministers Council.\nHe also congratulated the people and the Government of Pakistan on the occasion of 82nd Pakistan Resolution Day.",
