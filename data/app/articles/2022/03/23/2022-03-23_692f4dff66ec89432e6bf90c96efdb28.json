The entire world respected the prime minister, he added.\nHighlighting the prime minister’s achievements at foreign front, he said two meetings of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) were held in the country in the last three months. His efforts also led to the adoption of a resolution by the United Nations to designate March 15 as an “International Day to Combat Islamophobia”, he added.\nThe minister said it was the prime minister who drew attention of the whole world towards the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. He also revived the Kashmir issue at international level by becoming a “brave advocate” of the people of Kashmir. “Only Prime Minister Imran Khan can do all of this,” the minister remarked.",
