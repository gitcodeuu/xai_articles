We should ensure that regular meetings should take place to allow us to take stock of our bilateral relationship”, Sanjrani remarked.\nSadiq Sanjrani underscored that after the signing of Memoranda of Cooperation on Technical Intern Training Program (TITP) and Specified Skilled Workers (SSW) Programs in 2019, we must now re-double our efforts for these to materialize in earnest.\nHe commended the government of Japan for including Pakistan in the JDS Scholarship Program (the Project for Human Resource Development Scholarship by Japanese Grant Aid) in which 20 of our students were provided the opportunity to take part in different graduate programs in Japanese Universities.\nSanjrani apprised the visiting dignitary that the Ministry of Commerce had conveyed its consent to participate in the Osaka 2025 Expo recently.
