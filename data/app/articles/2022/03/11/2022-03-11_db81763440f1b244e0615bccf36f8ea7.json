In this context, Pakistan has a huge advantage for its huge bulge as the world was also looking at the country for quality human capital.\nHe said the information technology had enabled the girls to run their businesses while being at home.\nHe told the gathering of students hailing from across the country that Facebook had been given a target to train 100,000 girls this year to enable them market their products to international buyers.\nPresident Alvi also cautioned the youth about the phenomenon of fake news which, according to the latest study, mostly impacted the children of up to 14 years age.\nExemplifying young Swedish environmental activist Greta Thunberg and Indian Muslim girl Muskan Khan for her courage to protect her right of wearing Hijab, the president advised the girls to contribute to the national development after getting education, instead of sitting at home.\nSecretary Ministry of Federal Education and Professional Training Naheed Durrani said contrary to the past, the children in the current era required constant support and counseling to make them opt a career.\nShe said the events like the Expo were inevitable for the youth to provide them opportunities for asking questions and remove their suspicions about the particular fields they wanted to join and also boost their confidence.\nAdvising the students to give a special focus on technical skills, the federal secretary said while entering the practical life, the youths should also consider their soft skills.\nAdditional Secretary of the ministry Mohiyuddin Wani said it was for the first time that the local and international professional organizations had been brought at one platform for career guidance of the youth.\nHe said the prominent speakers would also address the event to share their experiences and guide the youngsters on their career planning.",
