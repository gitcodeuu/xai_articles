Chaudhary Pervaiz Elahi had been requested to mediate among the stakeholders for bringing improvement in the law, he added.\nFawad said owners of newspapers today held a meeting with Pervaiz Elahi and the federal government representatives, and added the things were advancing in the right direction.\nThe minister said the decision on PECA should be worked out on a political forum, adding it was the prerogative of the parliament, legislators and the government to draft effective legislations on multiple issues, and judiciary’s responsibility was to implement the laws, enacted by the parliament.\nFawad said induction of J10C fighter aircraft into Pakistan Air Force (PAF) fleet had effectively countered and ended so-called superiority of India it had been claiming after getting the Rafale aircraft. ” By the Grace of Allah Almighty, Pakistan Air Force has got modern aircraft” he added.",
