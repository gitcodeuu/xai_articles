  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 11 (APP): Minister of Sate for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib on Friday termed the opposition a group of defeated mindset as they were realizing their defeat on ‘No confidence motion’ against the government.\nThe opposition would face defeat in the parliament regarding the ‘No confidence move’ as it was always failed at every front against the treasury benches, he stated while talking to a private news channel.\nHe said the opposition leadership was a group of public money looters and they were trying to create unrest in the country for gaining their personal goals, adding the opposition was trying to get National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) from the government but it would not succeed in that regard.\nThe minister said all the allied political parties were fully in contact with the government and they would support Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nFarrukh Habib said the national institutions were strengthened and they were performing their duties as the recent incident of destroying the Indian missile was the ample proof in that regard.\nReplying to a question, he said the Election Commission of Pakistan should take stern action against the Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (JUI-F) leadership for bringing private armed force in the capital of the country and entered in the federal lodges without permission.\nHe said Nawaz Sharif went abroad by the permission of the courts on the basis of medical grounds but when he reached in London, he started to criticize the courts and the national institutions.",
