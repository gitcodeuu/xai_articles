No MNAs were nominated in any FIRs, he said.\nHe said Ansar ul Islam was declared banned outfit on October 24, 2019. Under the constitution, no one could keep private militia, he said\nHe said the police carried out search operation after taking permission of the Speaker National Assembly and obtaining search warrant from magistrate, he said.\nHe said five police officials sustained injuries in the incident while 6 police personnel were suspended. Inquiry has been ordered into the incident and was directed to submit findings of the inquiry within 48 hours.\nThe minister said police personnel remained polite despite using inappropriate language by Senator Kamran Murtaza.\nNo-confidence motion against the Prime Minister was democratic right of the opposition. However, he made it clear that strict action would be taken if anybody tried to take law into their hands.\nHe categorically said that private militia of any party would not be allowed to take law into hand.\nThe minister said they were ready to provide more security to the opposition members. The opposition parties did not have support of 172 members for the success of no-confidence motion against the PM and now wanted to flee by sabotaging the motion through some sort of rumpus.\nHe said Nawaz Sharif and Zardari were trying to use Maulana Fazlur Rehman for their personnel gains. Both the opposition parties used Fazlur Rehman in the past, he said.\nHe asked the JUI-F Head to refrain from using the students of seminaries for political purposes.The minister also vowed to take stern action against those who took law into their hands irrespective of their influence.\nTo a question, he said PM Imran Khan has given a sovereign and independent foreign policy and imperialistic forces were trying to damage it.\nTo another query, he said that he had great respect to all Ulemas belonging to various schools of thought.",
