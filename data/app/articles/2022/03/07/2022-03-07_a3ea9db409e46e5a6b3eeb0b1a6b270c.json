  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 7 (APP):Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Ali Muhammad Khan on Monday said there might be disagreements within a party but it did not mean that the party members or ministers were against the leadership.\nAll members of assemblies belonging to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf and leaders firmly stood with Prime Minister Imran Khan, he said while talking to a private news channel.\nThe minister said both Aleem Khan and Jahangir Tareen were assets of the PTI. The difference of opinion among the members of a party was the beauty of democracy.\nThe PTI was a democratic party where its each member could express his opinion freely, he added.\nHe cited that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz leaders Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif had differences on many issues, and like was the case of other PML-N leaders.\nTo a question, the minister said they had no threat fro the so-called trust move of the opposition.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
