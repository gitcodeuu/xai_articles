While talking to APP, representative ICA Haroon shared, “The one-day function will feature stalls of artwork and baked goodies made by the students from the Zam Zam Autism Centre ” adding that the idea is to show people how they can be integrated into regular activities.\nOn the same day, the ICA team will also conduct a “Balance Bike Competition” for kids 5 years and under. This cycle race will commence from 5 p.m. at the same venue, where the participants can be registered.\nHappiness Bazaar will hold its monthly cause-driven retail gala on Saturday here to spread awareness regarding Autism, besides some pre-Ramzan retail therapy for families.\nThis time the event will see around 100 home-spun brands, majority of which run by women, setting up their pop-ups at PNCA lawn to showcase their crafts from 4 p.m to 10 p.m.\nFounder THB Zaira Rizvi told APP, “For the first time, we have a child entrepreneur on board. To honour world autism day and remove the stereotypes regarding this neurodiversity, ARCRWP team recommended a student of theirs.”\nThe kidpreneur -a passionate baker is a young child on the autism spectrum and will display his work at the upcoming festivity. On a trial basis, he participated in the fair arranged by the school where his products sold out and gained appreciation from the visitors.\n“He is a student of the school run by the autism society school, Masha’Allah he has joined mainstream school recently” she added.\n“The parents observed he is interested in cooking, and they wanted to inculcate entrepreneurship skills.” Zaira shared.\nAround 40,000 children have been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in Pakistan, according to Pakistan Autism Society. However, the amount could be more than this as currently there is no standardised assessment and support available in the country.",
