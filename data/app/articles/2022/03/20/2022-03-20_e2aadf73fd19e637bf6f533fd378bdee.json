The ministers underlined the need for the OIC to play a leading role in delivering humanitarian and development assistance to the people of Afghanistan. The meeting also decided to establish a trust fund for humanitarian affairs under the auspices of the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), to serve as a means to direct humanitarian aid to Afghanistan, through partnership with other international actors.Following the decision of the extraordinary meeting to appoint him as a Special Envoy of the OIC Secretary-General to Afghanistan, Ambassador Tariq Bakheet, OIC Assistant Secretary-General for Humanitarian, Cultural and Family Affairs, made several visits to Member States and established contacts with international partners in order to ensure appropriate coordination of aid and assistance efforts.

It also invited them to put in place a mechanism to direct urgent and continued humanitarian assistance to the people of Afghanistan.
