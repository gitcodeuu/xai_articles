As a result the International Court of Arbitration leveled $6.4 billion award on government of Pakistan while on the same time the London Court of Arbitration was also imposing another $4 billion fine on Pakistan.\nHe said soon after taking over the charge, Prime Minister Imran Khan aggressively pursued the case and directed to draw a suitable solution as early as possible.\nAs a result an agreement was settled today under which Antofagasta decided not to participate in the reconstituted project and withdrew from its claim of $3.9 billion in place of $900 million.\nHe informed that the $900 million would be paid by the three SOEs and in return they would get the 25% share of the project.\nHad the PM not taken his personal interest in the case, Pakistan would have to pay the huge amount of $11 billion as a penalty, he added.Shaukat Tarin said Pakistan and Balochstan would be benefited for over 100 years from this project and the total worth is estimated to be over $100 billion.\nTerming the new agreement as a land mark achievement for Pakitan, Hammad Azhar said it was a historic day as it had not only avoided $11 billion worth of penalty but also created a new opportunity for Pakistan.\nHe said this was not for first time the PTI government had achieved the landmark success, but it had also avoided the country from moving to FATF black list by implementing 32 out of 35 conditions. The government also saved billions of dollars by renegotiating the costly IPP agreements.\nThe minister informed that according to the Barrick Gold, Reko Diq was the only one part with such huge gold and copper reserves. There were also other reserves in the area.\nSo a lucrative mining cluster is going to be developed in Pakistan, he added.",
