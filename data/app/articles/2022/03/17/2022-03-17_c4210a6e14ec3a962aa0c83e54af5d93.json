The Foreign Minister shared Pakistan’s stance on Ukraine, emphasizing cessation of hostilities, sustained dialogue and astute diplomacy for a diplomatic solution.

The Foreign Minister hoped that talks between Russia and Ukraine could yield a positive outcome.The Foreign Minister said that Pakistan was immensely thankful to neighboring European countries for support extended in evacuation of Pakistani nationals from Ukraine. Foreign Minister Qureshi informed his Austrian counterpart that as a gesture of solidarity, the government of Pakistan had sent relief assistance to the people of Ukraine to mitigate their suffering in these difficult times.Foreign Minister Qureshi briefed Foreign Minister Schallenberg about serious human rights violations in IIOJK which demanded attention of the international community in holding India accountable for the human rights crimes being committed in the occupied territory.The Foreign Minister further apprised the Austrian Foreign Minister of the so-called “accidental” firing of a missile from India into Pakistani territory adding that the explanation provided by India, was unconvincing and raised several questions.
