  "content": "LAHORE, Mar 25 (APP):Special Representative to Prime Minister for Religious Harmony and Middle Eastern Affairs Hafiz Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi has said that the entire Muslim Ummah is lauding Pakistan for successfully organising the conference of foreign ministers of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\nAddressing a press conference here on Friday, he said the conference discussed Islamophobia and Kashmir issues in detail. He said that the results of the conference would soon be visible and now March 15 would be observed every year as the International Day to Combat Islamophobia.\nAshrafi said that India attempted to target the conference at Islamabad through negative propaganda; however, Pakistan thwarted its nefarious designs.\n“Some local elements are also criticising the meeting of OIC for discussing blasphemy,” he said and asked whether it was not an issue of every Muslim.\nHe said that every participant appreciated Pakistan and several OIC members heaped praise on the country for its progress in the defence sector.\nHe said that the OIC meeting had reduced the distances among Saudi Arabia, Iran, Afghanistan and Egypt.\nHe appealed to all political parties to maintain peace and avoid violence during their rallies in upcoming days.",
