  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 22 (APP):Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi Tuesday said Pakistan remained committed to the early, just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people.\nSpeaking during the meeting of OIC Contact Group on Jammu and Kashmir here, he said today’s interaction would help in taking stock of the political and security environment and the deteriorating humanitarian and human rights situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and consider ways and means to address these challenges.“The right to self-determination is the fundamental tenet of international law. The right to decide one’s own destiny is the essence of freedom and is critical to human dignity. Unfortunately, the people of Jammu and Kashmir are yet to enjoy this inalienable right.”“For the last seventy years Kashmiris have been living under the most atrocious occupation ever since the Indian forces illegally landed in Jammu and Kashmir. There is nothing as painful as a brutal occupation, and nothing as moving as the voice and plight of those braving it.”“Unless addressed, the monumental betrayal of the Kashmiri people in contravention of the cardinal principles of international law, the UN Charter, and key human rights instruments, will continue to haunt the world conscience,” he added.\nThe minister said generations of Kashmiris had grown up under the shadow of fear, torture and intimidation. “It is a tale of heart-wrenching suppression and trauma caused by indiscriminate and unrestrained use of power. History has witnessed few parallels of such flagrant violations of fundamental rights as in the IIOJK. Gross violations of human rights, shameless brutality, remorseless moral bankruptcy and appalling atrocities characterize the reality of Indian occupation of Jammu and Kashmir today. A military force of over 900,000 Indian troops has turned the heavenly valley of Kashmir into the world’s largest prison.”He recalled that Indian repression had intensified manifolds since the illegal and unilateral Indian actions of 05 August 2019. “It is beyond belief that almost the entire Kashmiri leadership remains incarcerated under inhuman conditions, often dying while in custody. Kashmiri youth is a specific target as they suffer illegal detentions, torture, enforced disappearances, indiscriminate use of pellet guns, and extra-judicial killings in staged cordon-and-search operations.”Muslim majority in Kashmir was being turned into a minority in their own land through illegal demographic changes in violation of the international law and the Fourth Geneva Convention, he added.He said the moral bankruptcy of Indian occupation forces was laid bare by the callous and inhuman attitude in handling the mortal remains of Syed Ali Geelani-the iconic Kashmir leader and freedom fighter.The scale and spectrum of Indian abuses in IIOJK had exponentially grown with devastating human toll.Operating under draconian laws with complete impunity, the Indian occupation forces were committing unspeakable atrocities to break the will of Kashmiris and to resist the occupation, he added.The recent arrests and reprisals against human rights defenders and journalists on fabricated charges in IIOJK was another example of India’s continued persecution and intimidation of civil society, Qureshi noted.“India continues to out-rightly deny access to UN Special Procedures, independent human rights observers and global media, thereby evading independent assessment of the ground situation in IIOJK.”He said in September last year, Pakistan unveiled a dossier that extensively documented irrefutable evidence of India’s state terrorism and gross and systematic human rights violations in the IIOJK.“The 131-page dossier covers accounts of 3432 cases of war crimes perpetrated by Indian occupying forces. It is corroborated by meticulously gathered audio and video evidence. These reports and the Dossier provide sufficient evidence for the international community to hold India to account for its reprehensible conduct in the IIOJK which is repugnant to every canon of civility and international humanitarian law.”He said the Jammu and Kashmir dispute was one of the longest standing items on the agenda of the UN and OIC.He called on India to immediately reverse its unilateral and illegal measures instituted in IIOJK since 05 August 2019 and end human rights violations in IIOJK.He also asked India to withdraw the occupation forces from IIOJK so that people of Kashmir could enjoy their right to live freely and reverse the demographic changes in the occupied territory.The minister asked India to release all political prisoners and stop the persecution of Kashmiri political leadership, lift curbs on educational institutions in IIOJK and allow Kashmiri youth especially girls to fulfill its obligation of holding a free and impartial UN supervised plebiscite to let the Kashmiris exercise their inalienable right to self-determination as enshrined in numerous UNSC resolutions.He said in view of the deteriorating situation in the IIOJK, it was imperative that the OIC doubled its efforts to facilitate a lasting solution to the Jammu and Kashmir dispute.“The oppressed people of Kashmir, now more than ever, count on OIC and the Muslim Ummah as saviors.”",
