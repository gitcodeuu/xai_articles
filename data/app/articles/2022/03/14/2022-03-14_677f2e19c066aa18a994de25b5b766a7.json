  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 14 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday said to ensure peace in the world, the States needed to promote a morality-based world order rather than the imposition of their own self-centric laws.\nAddressing here at a seminar by the Pakistan Institute for Parliamentary Services (PIPS), he stressed peace initiatives to save humanity from the disaster of wars.\nThe president regretted that despite the havoc of big wars, the world in fact had not learned to avoid war.\nHe said the values of morals and empathy had started vanishing in the world contrary to the civilized culture of humanity.\nHe said Islam favoured equality among mankind regardless of their difference of religion, race, or creed.\nDr Alvi said Pakistan had a golden opportunity to benefit from the global opportunities and added that the quickest way for the country was to jump on to the train of information technology at the earliest.\nHe said huge responsibility lay on the decision-makers including bureaucracy, parliamentarians, and intellectuals to match with the pace of technological development.\nHe said lagging behind in technological advancements could lead to the conservativeness of mindsets.\nHe suggested in this regard focusing on adopting ‘exponential’ rather than a ‘linear’ journey of progress.\nPresident Alvi said fake news was used as a tool to bombard weak nations and resulted in their destruction.\nHe urged the youth to be wary of fake news and prevent them from affecting the direction of their goals.",
