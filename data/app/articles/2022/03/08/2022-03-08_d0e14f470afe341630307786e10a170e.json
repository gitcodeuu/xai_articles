They have held prominent positions, including as Prime Minister, Governor of State Bank of Pakistan, Speaker of National Assembly, Judge of the Supreme Court, Chief Justice of High Court, and important portfolios in the Cabinet as well as Federal and Provincial Secretaries, Generals, fighter pilots and UN peacekeepers,” it said.\nThe FO also paid special tribute to the remarkable Pakistani women in diplomacy for their exemplary service, hard work and dedication in contributing to the foreign policy objectives and ably representing Pakistan across the world.\nIt also expressed solidarity with the oppressed women in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nFor over seven decades, they are enduring egregious human rights abuse by Indian occupation forces including sexual violence, rape and molestation – that have been extensively documented by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as well as by various UN Special Procedures Mandate Holders, it said.\nThe FO urged upon the international community to hold India accountable for these serious crimes.",
