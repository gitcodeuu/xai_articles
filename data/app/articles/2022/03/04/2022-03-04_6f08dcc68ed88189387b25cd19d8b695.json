We will give opposition leaders a free box to watch the match…,” Fawad said while extending his invitation to the opposition.\nFawad asked the opposition to be a part of a national cause and join people in stadium instead of doing politics of agitation and undue criticism on the relief packages given to the masses.\nThe opposition’s planned long march against the government would dent the country’s image, especially when such a mega event of international cricket matches was taking place in Pakistan, he remarked.\nAnswering a question, Fawad said contrary to India’s efforts to stop international cricket in Pakistan, he wanted to see Indian cricket team also playing thrilling matches here with Pakistan.\n“We [Pakistan and India] should support each other,” he said stressing the need for revival of cooperation between the two countries in the fields of cricket, film and music.\nFawad said he also believed in restoration of people-to-people contacts between the two neighbouring countries.\nThe minister said around 65 percent people in India did not vote to Narendra Modi and they were suffering due to his wrong polices besides other minorities living there including Muslims.\nTo another question, Fawad hinted that Prime Minister Imran Khan would visit the Rawalpindi Cricket Stadium to watch the match at his convenience.",
