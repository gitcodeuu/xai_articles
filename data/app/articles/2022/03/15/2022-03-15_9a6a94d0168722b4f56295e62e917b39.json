We will seek to build ‘partnerships’ across the Islamic world, and build bridges of cooperation to address the myriad of challenges confronting the Ummah,” he said.\nQureshi said the OIC had taken a very firm stand on the issue of Palestine and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nA meeting of the Kashmir Contact Group will also be held on the sidelines of the OIC-CFM meeting, where Pakistan would present observational reports on Kashmir, he said.\n“Pakistan intends to get a ministerial resolution passed on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir,” he said.\nThe resolution, he said, was aimed at sending a message to those elements who were silent on the issue of Kashmir despite knowing the ground reality.\nAlso, he said, the meeting would discuss the humanitarian aspect of the situation in Afghanistan where millions were at risk of disease and hunger.\nThe foreign minister said Pakistan desired to promote cooperation among Islamic countries in the fight against corruption.\nHe said the meeting would also review the implementation of the decisions of the previous 47th meeting. “This upcoming OIC-CFM meeting is a reflection of our shared aspirations to ensure peace and progress,” he said.\nQureshi said Pakistan would like to further strengthen its relationship with the Muslim Ummah.\n“Pakistan will continue to work with other OIC Member States, towards harnessing our ‘collective ambition’ into ‘concrete action’, and to take tangible steps to further strengthen bonds of Islamic solidarity and cooperation,” he said.\nHe mentioned his telephonic conversation with the United Nations Secretary-General on Monday about the Indian missile fired towards Pakistan, where concern was expressed on the situation.\nHe said he had also written a letter to the UN Secretary-General and the President of the Security Council in this regard.\nThe foreign minister urged India to provide information regarding the specification, route, and trajectory of the missile.\nHe pointed out why India remained silent until Pakistan demanded an answer, adding that the aftermath of the missile could trigger a war between two nuclear-armed countries.\nHe termed India’s investigation on the matter as “insufficient” and mentioned that China had also raised the issue and called for an investigation.\n“We reject India’s response because of being insufficient,” he said.\nThe foreign minister mentioned India’s involvement in sabotaging the efforts of holding OIC-CFM and added that the diplomats at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad were making efforts to “subvert and sabotage” the event.\n“I know, the diplomats at the Indian High Commission are trying to\nFM Qureshi said Pakistan had no aggressive designs against any country, however, stressed that it would continue to highlight the issue of acts of terrorism against it.\nHe said Washington was aware that there were no direct or indirect negotiations in progress between Pakistan and India.\nHe said the international community and the United States could play a role in this regard to ensure peace and stability in the region.\nTo a question regarding the visit of Saudi Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman to Islamabad for the OIC-CFM meeting, he said it was the session of OIC foreign ministers and was not concerned with the Crown prince.\nOn opposition’s move of no-confidence vote, he termed it a ‘storm in a teacup’ which he said would end up in failure.\nHe said as long as the opposition stick to a peaceful long march, the government had no objection to this.",
