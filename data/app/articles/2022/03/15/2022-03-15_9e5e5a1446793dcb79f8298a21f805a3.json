Believe me, we are grateful to you and I also assure you that we either out of political consideration or in any government, will never retreat from our stated stand of giving you your right… we will help you get your right,” the minister categorically stated.\nHe said it was the right of the expats to cast vote in the country and Prime Minister Imran Khan and the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government would ensure it all cost.\nFawad said this was the fear which haunted the opposition, bent upondepriving the overseas Pakistanis of their due voting right.\nThe minister said that PTI’s stance was that a Pakistani living in any partof the world, should proudly say that he or she was a Pakistani.\nHe said that unfortunately no past ruler ever adopted such a stance, butnow the nation had trust in itself, and its leadership, thanks to the narrative.\nHe said undoubtedly dignity of Pakistanis had enhanced rapidly during PTIrule across the world and policies of Prime Minister Imran Khan did play a vitalrole in this regard .\nFawad said that now Pakistanis proudly carried the green passport and hada solemn declaration that Imran Khan was their prime minister.\nIn a critical note for Nawaz Sharif, he said that a former PM used to carry talkingpoints on various papers and got confused before the then US president.\nOn the contrary, when Prime Minister Imran Khan held talks with worldleaders, the nation was fully sure that he would uphold dignity of the country.\nHe said Imran Khan was the sole political leader, enjoying overwhelming supportin all four provinces, Gilgit-Baltistan and Kashmir and recent public meetings in Mailsi, Hafizabad and Buner, affirmed the fact.\nHe said that Nawaz Sharif and Asif Zardari could not have a walk in a park, how could they address such big public rallies. Criticizing Asif Zardari, he said that Ziaul Haq despite his best efforts, could not damage the PPP, but Zardari ruined the party of great leaders Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Benazir Bhutto within a few years.\nFawad said that Nawaz Sharif was the political heir of Zia but he didnot have courage to condemn the sloganeering of PPP activists at thegrave of his mentor during the recent long march.",
