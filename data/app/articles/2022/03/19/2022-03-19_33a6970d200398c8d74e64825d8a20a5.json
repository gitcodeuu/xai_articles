Current account deficit in Feb 22’ is down to $0.5b led by all-time high export numbers, and reduced imports”.\nDr Moeed underlined that continuous rising of exports and reduced imports were the main reasons behind shrinking of the current account deficit.\n“This is critical for correcting external imbalances to support sustained growth and these numbers show the success Pakistan is having”, he further said.",
