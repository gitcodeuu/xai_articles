Earlier, he launched the anthem along with Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain.\nThe OIC-CFM anthem is jointly released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Ministry of Information and Broadcasting. The anthem was sung and recreated by renowned vocalist Ali Zafar and produced by Tasawar ul Karim Baig.\nThe foreign minister said that it was an honour for Pakistan to host the OIC-CFM meeting on March 22-23, within a period of few months after the successful hosting of an extraordinary meeting of the OIC-CFM last year.\nHe said the OIC officials would keep arriving on March 21. “The two-day session is a significant one as it is being held at an important phase when the Ummah is confronted with a host of issues,” he said, citing the Palestine issue and Kashmir issue, the latter had assumed significance after India’s unilateral and illegal steps of Aug 5, 2019.\nQureshi referring to the recent UN’s adoption of OIC-backed resolution on Islamophobia, said that when the whole Ummah was united on any issue, the result had always been very fruitful. The whole world agreed to combat this issue and dedicated March 15 as a day to highlight it every year.\nThe foreign minister further said that foreign ministers from the member states of the OIC would also deliberate over the Afghan issue as the country was facing serious humanitarian and economic crises.\nOther global challenges like economic contraction and its fallout, and climate change, etc. would also come under consideration, he added.\nThe foreign minister further said that more than 100 resolutions would be considered during the two-day session.\nHe expressed the confidence that the member states would develop consensus and a comprehensive way forward after their consultation to address all the issues.\nQureshi said during the extraordinary session of OIC-CFM, Pakistan had highlighted the situation in Afghanistan, and in the upcoming meeting, it would highlight the Kashmir issue once again, urging the world that it could no longer neglect the grave situation there.\nHe said the OIC-CFM would hold deliberations to fully utilize the available resources for the unity, progress and prosperity of the ummah.\nHe said the OIC-CFM meeting would be a unique occasion for the whole nation as it would coincide with Pakistan’s Day celebrations.\nQureshi further informed that they had invited the worthy guests to attend Pakistan’s Day parade and witness the professional capability of Pakistan armed forces and the traditional floats of all the provinces, reflecting the national unity.\nHe also expressed gratitude to the information minister and efforts of the ministry and its cooperation.\nHe expressed that the anthem had revived the old memories and sentiments of the people.\nSpeaking on the occasion, Minister for Information Chaudhry Fawad Hussain said the anthem was authored by eminent poet Jameel-ud-din Aali over the old theme of OIC and composed with the help of the latest technology. The anthem signified theme of the unity among the Muslim Ummah and was influenced with the verses of the Holy Quran.",
