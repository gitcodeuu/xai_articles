Permission was given to JUI-F for today rally only and no application is yet submitted for their tomorrow rally, he said.\nThe minister said PML-N has sought permission to hold rally at the Srinagar Highway but was not allowed as the Apex Court and High Court have already directed the Interior Ministry and local administration to keep all main thoroughfare including Srinagar Highway opened. The courts’ directions would be strictly followed, he added.\nHe said that complete security would be provided to the rallies but no one would be allowed to block the roads. However, no one will be allowed to enter the Red Zone, he added.\nThe minister said mostly probably, the voting on no confidence against the Prime Minister will be held on April 4 if it was tabled on March 28 in the House. Complete security will be given to all the members, he said.He expressed the hope that Imran Khan would emerge victorious and all government allies would decide in favor of the Prime Minister.\nRasheed said the DG FIA has been directed to arrest MNA Jam Abdul Karim who was nominated in murder of journalist Nazim Jokhio soon after his arrival from Dubai. The accused MNA will be handed over to Sindh police after taken into custody for further legal procedure, he added. He said that Jam Abdul Karim would not only be arrested but also his name would be put in exit control list (ECL) besides providing it to Interpol.\nThe minister, while congratulating the armed forces, Rangers, FC and local administration for successfully holding OIC Foreign Ministers summit, said that anti Pakistan elements wanted to fail it.He urged all political parties to show their political maturity and avoid any confrontation.\nHe said currently there was no need to deploy army but made it clear that under Article 245, armed forces could be summoned with the approval of federal cabinet and PM.\nThe minister said the courts have directly put the responsibility on me and the Interior Ministry for maintenance of law and order in the Capital.He said the ruling party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) has also been allowed to hold public gathering on March 27 which would be addressed by Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nReplying to a question, the minister said that he had advised the Prime Minister to impose Governor’s rule in Sindh and declare emergency but the Prime Minister rejected his advised. Keeping in view immense popularity of Imran Khan, he said that he would advise the PM to go for early general elections also after giving poor-friendly budget.To another query, he said that talks were going on with all allies and estranged PTI lawmakers.\nHe said he would personally lead a mammoth procession from Rawalpindi to participate in the scheduled PTI gathering at Parade Ground on March 27. “I am firmly standing with Prime Minister Imran and will bring a biggest rally from Rawalpindi to the main rally,” he remarked.\nTo a separate question, the minister said that stern action would be taken those who had started malicious campaign against armed forces.",
