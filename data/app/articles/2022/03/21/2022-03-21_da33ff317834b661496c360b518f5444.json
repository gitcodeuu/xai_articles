Our health insurance is a major step in this regard to enable poor people get free medical treatment,” he said.\nHe termed the introduction of a uniform education system another milestone of his government that aimed at developing unity among the future generation.\nThe prime minister said the establishment of Rehtmatul lil Alameen Authority was a big step towards the capacity-building of the young generation in accordance with the teachings and morals of Prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon Him).\nOn the economy, he said all strong indicators were contributing to the financial stability of the country.\nPM’s Adviser on Health Dr Faisal Sultan said the new PIMS emergency ward and Jinnah Hospital would be the state-of-the-art centres of healthcare.\nHe said the government had brought immense improvement in the standard of public health facilities.",
