The Pakistan Navy had intercepted the Indian submarine a year back.\nThe minister emphatically stated that with Pakistan having strong and brave armed forces, including army, navy and air force, no one could cast an evil eye on the great country and the nation.\nSheikh Rashid appreciated the Pakistan Navy’s competence and resolve in defending the country’s maritime frontiers.",
