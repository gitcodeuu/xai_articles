  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Mar 3 (APP): President of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev was given a red carpet welcome as he arrived here at PM Office at start of his two-day state visit.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan received the Uzbek president at the official welcome ceremony where he was also given guard of honour by the contingents of the three services.\nShavkat Mirziyoyev, who is visiting here at the prime minister’s invitation, reviewed the guard of honor. The national anthems of both the countries were also played at the ceremony.\nLater, the Uzbek president and the prime minister introduced their respective delegations to each other before proceeding for one-on-one meeting.\nThe visiting dignitary also planted a sapling at the lawn of the PM Office.\nThis is the first visit of President Mirziyoyev to Pakistan since assuming office in 2016.\nHe is accompanied by a high-level delegation, comprising the foreign minister and other cabinet members, senior government officials, and business and media personnel.\nThe prime minister will also host a state banquet for the Uzbek president, who will also have a separate meeting with President Arif Alvi.\nThe visit also marked the historic commemoration of the 30th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic relations between Pakistan and Uzbekistan.\nBilateral relations including cooperation in political, trade, economy, connectivity, education, culture, security, defence cooperation and situation in Afghanistan are expected to be discussed during the two sides.\nPakistan and Uzbekistan are linked through a common faith, shared history and cultural affinities.\nPakistan was one of the first countries to recognize Uzbekistan after the Soviet disintegration and subsequent liberation of Central Asian states.\nThe Pakistan-Uzbekistan relationship has witnessed an upward trajectory over the past few years as part of Pakistan’s policy of engagement with Central Asian countries “Vision Central Asia” policy.\nThe two countries have been closely collaborating at regional and international fora, especially at the United Nations, Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Economic Cooperation Organization (ECO) and Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).\nChina’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has garnered further attention for the region. Two routes of the new Silk Road pass through Uzbekistan, connecting it to China, Iran, Turkey, West Asia and India.\nThe vision of the two countries is to provide a corridor to the Central Asian states through Afghanistan. A bus service had already been made fully operational, which had reduced the time of goods transportation to Moscow to 12 days from 25-30 days.\nPakistan and Uzbekistan are also working to establish a rail link, which would boost trade with the Central Asian states.\nCooperation in education, culture, joint research, media ventures including joint film on Baburi heritage and dubbing of Pakistani dramas in Uzbek language are also in the pipeline.\nThe visit by Uzbek President reflected the enhanced diplomatic stature of Pakistan. With this visit, the regional cooperation notion and Pakistan view-point of interdependence will get strengthened.\nThe visit will help in evolving understanding on common stance over Afghanistan.\nPakistan is focusing on regional connectivity with the regional countries and beyond. Engagement with Central Asian countries within the framework of “Vision Central Asia” policy, with five key strands: political and diplomatic, trade and investment, energy and connectivity, security and defence, and people-to-people relations is on the top of agenda.\nEnhanced cooperation between Pakistan and Uzbekistan will complement the NorthSouth connectivity especially with regards to the CPEC.\nGeo-strategic location of Pakistan is a spoke for economic connectivity leading to regional prosperity. Pakistan’s efforts to reap the benefits of its location are not only valuable for Pakistan but the other countries of the region equally.\nPakistan offers the shortest route to the Indian Ocean to all the landlocked countries of Central Asia including Uzbekistan alongside Western China. Its three main ports, Karachi port, Qasim port and the newly built Gwadar port along the Arabian Sea ensure direct connectivity and access to the Middle Eastern and African markets.\nPakistan has a huge potential for investment and economic gains and hence improved ties with neighbours will of in interest of the region.\nPakistan and Uzbekistan solidifying bilateral relations has also sent a positive message to the rest of the Central Asian Republics about Pakistan’s policy for the region that is grounded in economic cooperation, development and connectivity.\nRegional future is linked to globalisation and the international system, therefore Pakistan foreign policy targets developing ties with its neighbours in the region.",
