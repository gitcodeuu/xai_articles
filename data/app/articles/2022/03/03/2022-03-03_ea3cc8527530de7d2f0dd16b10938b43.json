  "content": "KARACHI, Mar 03 (APP):PTI Vice Chairman and Foreign Minister Makhdoom Shah Mehmood Qureshi on Thursday said Prime Minister Imran Khan enjoyed confidence of both the masses and the Parliament.\nThe popularity of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was on the rise as evident from the increasing number of participants of Sindh Haqooq March with each passing day, he said while addressing huge public gatherings in Umerkot and Mithi.Earlier at the start of march, he told a press conference in Mirpurkhas that there was no grouping in the PTI as its parliamentarians firmly stood with the PM and Asif Zardari would not be able to buy their loyalties.\nThe Pakistan Muslim League-Q had also announced to keep its alliance with the PTI intact and the opposition’s no-trust move would fail like that of its failure to stop passage of State Bank bill from the Parliament, he added.\nHe was accompanied by Member of the National Assembly Makhdoom Zain Hussain Qureshi, Leader of the Opposition in Sindh Assembly Haleem Adil Sheikh, PM’s Special Assistant on Sindh Affairs Arbab Ghulam Rahim, MNA Lal Malhi and other PTI leaders.\nOn the sixth day, the march started from Mirpurkhas and proceeded to Badin. A large number of people along with the PTI party workers warmly welcomed the participants at various places by showering flower petals amid slogans.\nQureshi said despite use of government resources, the march of Pakistan Peoples Party was faltering. Its leaders were demanding accountability of only three and a half years instead of that of the public wealth they had plundered for 15 years.\nThere was panic in the ranks of Sindh ruling party as PTI’s flags were being removed in Karachi ahead of its march’s arrival there on March 6, he added. Bilawal should not be panicked as it was just the beginning of the PPP’s downfall. They would continue their movement for the rights of Sindh people, he added.\nThe PTI vice chairman condemned an attempt by the PPP workers to stop the Haqooq-e-Sindh March in Kandiari. On the other hand Bilawal, who was going to Multan today, would not face such reaction from the PTI workers there, he added.At Umerkot, Qureshi thanked the local people for casting some 100,000 votes in the last general election braving the use of force by PPP.\nHe said the PTI’s Federal Government had provided health cards to 1.6 million residents of Tharparkar district, but the Sindh government blocked the issuance of health cards in other districts.\nThe Sindh government had received Rs 9,000 billion funds from the Centre in 14 years, and according to official documents Rs 1,400 billion out of them had been embezzled, he added.\nThe PPP, he said, had played the ‘Sindh card’ and formed government for five times in the province, but its leadership served their own interests and did nothing for the people.\nHe had selected Tharparkar for election because it was situated at Pakistan-Inda border and I was there to defend ideological boundaries of Pakistan, Qureshi added.\nHe asked the Sindh people to join the ranks of PTI if they wanted a bright future for their young generations. Time had come to “break the arrow” by stamping “bat” in the elections, he added.\nQureshi told the media that he had a telephonic conversation with vice president of European Union to discuss the Ukrainian situation. They had the consensus that dialogue was the only way to resolve conflicts, he added.\nHe also had a conversation with his Romanian counterpart about the safe evacuation of Pakistani students from Ukraine, the minister said. The Pakistani Embassy in Kyiv had helped the Indian students and served them food as well, he said.\nPTI leaders Makhdoom Zain Hussain Qureshi, Haeem Adil Sheikh and Arbab Ghulam Rahim also addressed the public meetings.",
