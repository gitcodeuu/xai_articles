The institution itself had withdrawn its decision which was challenged before the court, he added, and prayed the court to dispose of the case.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer said his client had also demanded many other things in his case. The appointment of Dr Attaur Rehman as HEC member was illegal, due to that they wanted to continue the case, he added.\nThe court sought the comments from respondents and adjourned the case till June 20.",
