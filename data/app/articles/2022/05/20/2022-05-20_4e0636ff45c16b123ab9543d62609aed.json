He said notice should also be taken of statements given by the PTI chief and former Minister for Interior, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.\nHe said that former PM(Imran Khan) was maligning the national institutions and should be held accountable for his unjust criticism against the state institutions.\n“I was trialed on alleged charges but I was innocent and faced the court proceedings as a law abiding citizen of the country. Imran Khan has crossed all limits while criticizing the state institutions which is reprimandable and the quarter concerned should take note of that” he added.",
