The government would respond to the abuse of Imran Niazi by initiating development projects.\nThe PM said he had to increase the prices of petrol with a heavy heart but at the same time a subsidy of Rs 28 billion per month was given to 85 million people as the government was aware of their problems.\nEvery family under the scheme would get a subsidy of Rs 2,000 per month on petrol purchase, he told.\nHe said Imran Niazi in his last days reduced the prices of petrol at a time when the prices were very high in the international market.\nImran knew that he was being ousted from the government through constitutional means so he set a trap for the incoming government, he observed.\nHe said he would provide 10 kilogramme flour bag for Rs 490 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa if the chief minister of the province did not agree to his request in the next 24 hours to fund the scheme for provision of flour at subsidized rates.\nPeople in Punjab were already getting flour at this rate, he told.While at the utility stores 10 kg flour bag would be given for Rs 400 across Pakistan including the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, he informed.The PM said Imran Khan burdened the country with huge loans which would be paid back by coming generations\nHe said a scheme of free laptops would be announced in the next budget in June for youth who would achieve distinction in the examinations.\nShehbaz said local bodies elections were held peacefully in Balochistan and the voter turn out remained at 30-35 percent which was a very encouraging development.\nIt proved that people in the far flung areas of Balochistan had trust in the democratic process and in the environment of security, he added.\nPML-N vice president Maryam Nawaz, PML-N leaders Amir Muqam, Murtaza Javed Abbasi, Sardar Shahjahan, Captain ® Safdar Awan and Sardar Muhammad Yousaf also addressed the gathering.\nEarlier, the prime minister also inaugurated a number of development projects for the area.",
