  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 25 (APP): Zonergy corporation, Pakistan’s leading integrated solar solutions provider with more than 30% market share, has officially announced its entry into the European market with the establishment of an office in Italy.\nZonergy Europe will operate from Milan where it would offer European customers its extensive range of smart and efficient renewable energy solutions, said a news release.\nZonergy has been in Pakistan for last several years with the key initiative of 300 MW Quaid-e-Azam Solar park in Bahawalpur, Punjab province.\nZonergy has been one of the key players in evolving Pakistan’s renewable Energy landscape.  Zonergy is widely recognized for its global expertise in PV and energy storage and now looks forward to sharing its technical strength and professionalism with new and existing clients in Europe.\nThe Company has an existing portfolio based around the four major product categories of residential, commercial, large-scale power stations and photovoltaic modules\nZonergy is a widely respected integrated smart microgrid solution provider, dedicated to providing its customers with the most advanced solutions and services. The company’s offerings are based on residential energy storage systems, incorporating inverters, lithium battery modules and BMS, and on solutions for the Commercial and Industrial segment.\nKey Features of Residential Systems:\nModular design: modular design of the overall system solution, stackable installation, flexible capacity expansion and power upgrade.\nAesthetically attractive: ‘white goods’ style, suitable for a modern home\nSafe and reliable: intelligent natural heat dissipation, multiple protection against overvoltage, undervoltage, overcurrent and overheating.\nSmart and user friendly: support of GPRS, WiFi, RS485 and USB interfaces, LCD display, APP and web-based remote monitoring\nSmart Switching: support of zero power failure and seamless switching between on and off-grid.\nCompatibility: wide PV voltage range of 120-550V, high current of 13.5A\nSince its foundation, Zonergy has developed both technical strength and significant engineering experience. The company is home to first-class technical R&D and engineering implementation, giving it a profile which allows it to cover both the domestic market in China and also have a presence in a number of overseas countries, including those in Europe.\nZonergy’s hybrid energy storage system supports functions such as PV access, battery storage and  grid-connected and off-grid output. It can be connected to photovoltaic strings from 200V to 850V and used with 420V-850V high-voltage energy storage batteries. The system utilizes a reliable power frequency off-grid inverter, based on simple wiring and strong inductive load capacity. It can be part of a complementary oil-solar off-grid system with a fuel-fired generator.\nWhen the generator is started on continuous rainy days, it can reduce the battery configuration and the initial investment.\nThe inverter has 100% unbalanced load capacity, which is suitable for driving single-phase loads. It can also monitor the voltage, current and insulation resistance of each string, as well as the voltage, current, temperature and remaining power of the storage batteries, constantly checking system operation to reduce potential faults.\nWith a multi-level modular design, the inverter supports multiple sets in parallel, covering 30kW to 500kW inverter and 100kWh-900kWh battery capacities, making it suitable for multi-scenario distributed energy projects. With IP55 protection, intelligent monitoring and remote operation and maintenance, the EMS management system has multiple operational modes. Hierarchical linkage and multiple levels of protection ensure the safe operation of the system, including lightning protection, battery and thermal management and a fire extinguishing system.\nZonergy continues to evolve by offering smart and intelligent microgrid energy solutions based on large commercial business requirements and emerging needs. The company embraces a model of continual growth, offering customized and cost-efficient solutions to its global customer base in order to fulfil its ambition of becoming a world leading PV manufacturer and solution provider.",
