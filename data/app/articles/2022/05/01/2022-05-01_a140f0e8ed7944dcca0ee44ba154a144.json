The Sindh government has formulated its own provincial labour policy since the 18th amendment”, Senator Sherry Rehman underscored.\nShe added that every government should work for the rights and welfare of the workers.\nThe current government has announced to raise the minimum monthly wage to Rs25,000 which is a welcoming start, Senator Sherry Rehman said.",
