All such narratives and statements are spreading hatred among the masses and proving as disservice for the country.\nShe said Imran Khan was right when he said, “He will be more dangerous when ousted from the government. He has actually become more dangerous for the country”.Imran Khan has not even spared House of Allah (Masjid-e-Nabvi) and caused a rukus there, going below the belt which is highly condemnable.\nShazia Marri questioned that where were the five million houses, five million jobs and 150 universities for which Imran Khan has promised.He remained unable to construct even a single dam or a university. “Imran Khan miserably failed to fulfill all his promises and cannot utter even a single sentence on his government performance in public meetings”.\nShe said Imran Khan was only spreading hatred and provoking masses through false narratives and lies in the public meeting.Imran Khan has not revealed his own corruption how he misused the charity funds meant for hospital construction for his political career. “All his politics is based on conspiracies”, she added.\nThe foreign funding case again Imran Khan has not decided for the last eight years and he is saying that this case is based on a conspiracy. “Why Imran Khan asked Election Commission of Pakistan not to reveal its findings to the public”, she asked.\nResponding to a question, Shazia Marri said that the cabinet meeting discussed the public issues and violation of constitution. “Imran Khan is now worried of breaching the constitution that is why producing false stories”, she said.\nTo another question, she said every government should be concerned about the prices of daily commodities including potatoes, tomatoes, flour, sugar and pulses.Responding to another question, she said all the PTI MNAs including former speaker National Assembly are still availing salaries, allowances, car facility and accommodation in Parliament Lodges.\nShe urged the PTI MNAs to support the coalition government for electoral reforms as they are availing all the privileges.On the occasion, Faisal Karim Kundi said that Pakistan was going to improve good relation with United States of America (USA), European Union and all the countries for which Minister for Foreign Affairs, Bilawal Bhutto was in USA on official tour.\nHe said Chairman Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Imran Khan should tell about the performance of his government to the masses in public gathering despite criticizing the national institutions.Faisal Kundi said that at the time of appointment of Chief Election Commissioner, Imran Khan had said that he was a good person but now is criticizing.\nHe said that PTI chief was misusing the resources of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa government to attend the public gathering across the country.The spokesman said that PPP would make legislation on Medical Teaching Institutions system.\nFaisal Kundi said that now Imran Khan was demanding security due to life threat but unfortunately that person took back the security of JUI-F chief Maulana Fazl-ur-Rehman, Aftab Khan Sherpao and other political leadership which resulted in terror attacks on them.\n“The next general elections will be held in consensus with coalition partners not on the ambition of Imran Khan as he becomes a past,” he added.He said that PPP was already of the opinion that next general elections would be held in the country after the electoral reforms.",
