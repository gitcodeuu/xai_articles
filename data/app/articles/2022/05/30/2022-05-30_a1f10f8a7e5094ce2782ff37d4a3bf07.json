Our state policy on Palestine is very clear.”\nTarar said,”I will inform the House about the matter after having an official statement from the quarters concerned.” After getting complete information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and other relevant ministries, he would be in position to tell the House in next session.\nHe questioned, “How can a Pakistani passport holder travel to any such country? Making an official statement on any such story of the newspaper is not an appropriate way.”",
