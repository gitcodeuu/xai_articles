  "content": "ISLAMABAD, May 30 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Monday announced that his government would make no reduction in the budget of Higher Education Commission (HEC) for the upcoming fiscal year 2022-23.\nThe prime minister directed the Ministry of Planning and Finance to follow the instructions while preparing the next federal budget.\nThe decision has been taken to avoid the closure of several university programmes and to ensure smooth continuity of international higher education agreements.\nThere is no question of a cut in the budget of Higher Education Commission. I am aware of the negative effect that cuts have had on higher education during the past four years. I have given clear directions to Planning Commission & Ministry of Finance in this regard.\nThe prime minister also directed to reinvigorate the HEC on the manner it was functioning during the government of Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz.\nHe said the cuts in the budget of HEC during around four-year tenure of the previous government had put a negative impact on higher education, that needed to be reversed.\nPM Sharif stressed focusing on the revival of educational projects in universities across the country.\nHe also emphasized increasing the number of higher education programmes and making them meet international standards.\nThe prime minister urged a significant increase in the resources of HEC and the provision of necessary facilities to the faculty and students.",
