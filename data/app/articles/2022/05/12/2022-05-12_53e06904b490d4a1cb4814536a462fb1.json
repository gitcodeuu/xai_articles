In a nutshell, it can be used for anything other than human consumption, where a filtering process is required, he added.\nRDA spokesperson said that RDA had started rainwater harvesting with Turkish cooperation. He said the agency had given a gift of Rs 50 million for this project.\nHe further said RDA was working to expand rainwater harvesting project launched to utilize millions of gallons of rainwater.\nRDA had launched the project last year and a local mosque acquired the system to save rain water for ablution and then channeling the used water for irrigation in parks.\nThe project helped utilise millions of gallons of rain water instead of letting it drain into Nullah Leh and other drains.\nHe informed the rainwater harvesting system was inaugurated at Masjid Sarajia, Asghar Mall Scheme.\nRDA had started this work at Masjid Sarajia with the help of United Nations Development Programme (UNDP).\nHe said that water is very much needed in mosques and it is being extended to meet their needs. Rainwater collected was being used for ablution and washrooms and ablution water was being collected and used for plants and grass in the front park, he added.\nHe informed that Maulana Sirajuddin, Imam of Sarajia Mosque had thanked RDA and said that water is a blessing of Allah and it is a great work of RDA.\nThe spokesman said that the UNDP Research Officer Waqas Khan had also promised that the UN body would extend technical and financial assistance for using and recycling rainwater.\nHe said that during an earlier meeting, RDA along with the UNDP representative and imams of three major mosques mulled recycling rain and ablution water for reuse.\nTo a question he informed that RDA in collaboration with PHA would make efforts to expand the project and different places would be identified to install the rainwater harvesting projects.",
