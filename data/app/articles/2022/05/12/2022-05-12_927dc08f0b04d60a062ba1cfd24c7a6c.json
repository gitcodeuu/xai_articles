On this, former PFUJ president Afzal Butt said there was still the risk of Sabir’s arrest and prayed the court to adjourn the hearing instead of disposing of the case.\nThe court directed that the FIA should also inform the media house of the journalist concerned if there was any complaint about him. Afzal Butt said if there was a complaint against anyone then the FIA should conduct investigation instead of arresting him / her.\nThe court instructed the FIA to also consult the PFUJ on the SOPs regarding cases against  journalists to ensure transparency in its investigations.\nThe FIA director assured the court that the Agency would not harass any journalist and strictly follow the SOPs, which it had submitted to the court.\nFaisal Chaudhry Advocate, former information minister Chaudhry Fawad Hussain’s lawyer, argued that the activists of political parties were being arrested in treason cases now.
