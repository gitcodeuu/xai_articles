Similarly, Judicial Commissions were established to investigate the Memogate matter, and a still functional Judicial Commission exists for missing persons, that is headed by an Hon’able Judge of the Supreme Court”, he observed.\nHe further stated that there seemed to be a political consensus in the country as, according to press reports, the Prime Minister had also expressed a desire for establishing a Commission.\nPresident Alvi said that the nation held the Supreme Court in high regard and expected it to meet its expectations, adding that the Commission should investigate the matter based not on technicalities of law but in the real spirit of justice.\nHe said that it, undoubtedly, would be a great service to our country, as the people of Pakistan deserved clarity on such a matter of national importance.\nHe said that in world history there existed myriad examples of regime change operations through conspiracies which were later confirmed by the declassification of top-secret documents.\nHe lamented that it happened much later after the destinies of these countries had been significantly damaged by these illegal interventions.\n“Who knows better than your Honour that to prove, that a “smoking gun” has been identified in the hand of a conspirator, or to find a possible money trail, or to identify meetings where people have been motivated towards cover action, or where people have been bought and sold, could be a vigorous exercise”, he added.\n“I am of the strong opinion that even recorded circumstantial evidence can lead the way towards some conclusions, based not on technicalities of law but in the real spirit of ‘justice’”, he said.\nThe president regretted that in Pakistani history, people had alleged and strongly believed in many obvious but unfortunately unproven conspiracies such as the murder of the 1st prime minister of Pakistan Shaheed Liaquat Ali Khan, the Agartala Conspiracy case, PM Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto’s public waving of a letter and allegation of a conspiracy against him, President Ziaul Haq’s plane crash, Abbottabad incident, and many other matters that remained inconclusive.\nHe requested that the Judicial Commission should conduct an in-depth and thorough investigation into what may or may not have been planning and preparation, starting before or following the overt threat, in the form of a possible conspiracy for regime change in Pakistan.",
