Drinkable water and electricity is the top priority of the authorities in Gwadar,” he stated.\nKashani said a desalination plant of about 1.2 million gallons would become operational in six to eight months that would provide drinkable water for the locals. Moreover, the newly inaugurated state-of-the-art Pak-China Vocational & Technical Training Institute would provide three years’ training to local youth, “which is a big contribution by our Chinese friends”, he added.\n“Chinese authorities have also recently provided 3,000 solar panels to the poorest of the poor in Gwadar for the provision of electricity,” he informed the moot.\nDelivering the keynote speech, COPHC Chairman Zhang Baozhong spoke at length about the experiences of his seven-year stay in Gwadar. “We are cognizant of the fact that Gwadar deserves more rapid development to live up to the expectations of the local people. There is no denying the fact that it has developed much during the past seven years.”\nHe stated three reasons for the promising prospects of Gwadar: the cooperation of the Gwadar people, its vast resources, and its strategic location. “The inhabitants of Gwadar deserve respect and development according to their rightful demands”, Baozhong underscored.\n“We are sending 20 students to China on scholarships every year. We have been running a primary school here for the last five years and soon we will construct a secondary school as well. More than 6000 solar panel units have been distributed among the people of Gwadar so far, and around 500,000 trees have been planted,” Shahzad Sultan, Country Head Marketing of COPHC informed while providing details of the CSR initiatives.\nIPS Chairman Khalid Rahman highlighted the concept of CSR and elements that could improve the lives of the local inhabitants.\n“We must have solution-oriented recommendations, not problem-oriented,” he said adding that positive thinking and improvement in governance would bring a huge change in the life of the people of Gwadar.\n“CSR activities do not mean spending a share of your profit, it’s about creating an environment which is not harmful for the society in any way,” he added.",
