Imran Khan should told the public gatherings even a single measure he had taken for the welfare for masses during his four-year government tenure, he added.\nRaja Riaz suggested the coalition government for not showing any leniency to the participants of the planned long march as the PTI had nefarious designs, and asked to tackle them with iron hands.",
