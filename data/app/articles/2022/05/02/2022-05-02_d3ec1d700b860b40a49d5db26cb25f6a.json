The same is the true spirit of Eid and teachings of Holy Prophet Muhammad (Peace Be Upon Him), he added.\nThe prime minister said his government was committed to ensure country’s deliverance from the load shedding and was making all-out efforts to achieve the objective.\nHe also directed the authorities concerned to carry out no power outage till the three days of Eid-ul-Fitr to make the people properly enjoy the festivities of Eid.\nHe said keeping in view the Eid’s pleasures and the hardships of the inflation-hit people, the government had also decided not to increase the oil price.\nThe prime minister assured the nation that every moment of his tenure and all of his capabilities would be utilized to bring an ease to the people’s lives. In the coming days, the people would also feel the reduction in their hardships as an outcome of the government’s efforts.\nPrime Minister Sharif also asked the countrymen to remember the people of Palestine and Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir on the occasion of Eid and pray for their liberation from oppression as well as for their independence. He also expressed his good wishes for the people of Afghanistan and prayed for durable peace, progress and prosperity of the war-torn country.",
