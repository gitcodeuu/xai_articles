The youth dialogue aimed to create more awareness amongst Pakistani youth regarding their role at a multilateral level, at the policy making tables such as the Stockholm+50 International Meeting and at the Climate Negotiations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change`s Conference of Parties (COPs), said a news release.\nAmbassador of Sweden to Pakistan, Henrik Persson welcomed the participants and said “Sweden is on the track to become world’s first fossil-free welfare state, reaching net zero emissions by 2045. Stockholm+50 is an opportunity to consider what is going well, what can be improved and what we can do to meet the Sustainable Development Goals.\nVoices of youth needs to be communicated to the leaders to drive action to achieve sustainable development. It is possible to create a better future if we act together. Sweden is open for collaboration.”\nSpeaking on the occasion, Resident Representative, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Pakistan Knut Ostby said, “Pakistan is the fifth most populous and one of the youngest countries in the world. Currently, 68% of Pakistanis are below the age of 30, and 27% are aged between 15 and 29.\nThe current moment presents an opportunity for young Pakistanis to drive transformative changes on ground and be ambassadors of climate action. Through increased cooperation and dialogue, the youth can help strengthen the ability of businesses and governments to deal with impacts of climate change.\nThe youth now have the chance to advocate for a resilient and greener economy that will lead to prosperity, new jobs, and a healthier planet.”\nDirector General WWF-Pakistan, Hammad Naqi Khan stated, “As the largest conservation organization in Pakistan, WWF-Pakistan has been working to foster young people’s connection with nature.\nLast year alone, we engaged with over 14,000 youth through various initiatives. At WWF, we believe that youth are both advocates and catalysts of change and thus, an essential part of decision making.\nTherefore, we are working with partners to not only develop young people’s knowledge about sustainable development, but also connect them to experts, businesses and government, and elevate their voices to appropriate platforms.”\nSenator Sherry Rehman, Federal Minister for Climate Change attended the event as Chief guest.\nOver 60 young people aged between 11-25 participated in the dialogues and shared their policy proposals towards the right to a healthy environment. The dialogue was moderated by Ms Saher Rashid Baig, a Pakistani member of the Stockholm+50 Youth Task and a Global youth advocate for climate, ocean, gender and human rights.\nThe desired and concrete policy demands of the Youth Dialogue will be communicated to the Stockholm+50 Secretariat and incorporated in the policy positions of the Stockholm+50.",
