  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 14 (APP): The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday dismissed a petition seeking the disqualification of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP)’s MPA Faryal Talpur.\nAnnouncing the judgment, reserved on October 27 last, over a petition filed by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leaders Arsalan Taj and Rabia Azfar against the eligibility of PPP co-chairperson Asif Ali Zardari’s sister as a member of the Sindh Assembly, the ECP said the petitioners have failed to build case against Faryal Talpur as disqualification requires material and concrete evidence.\nThe ECP declared in its verdict that the respondent had disclosed her assets and that disqualification required material and concrete evidence. The petitioners failed to make a case for disqualification, it added.\nThe petition had alleged that the PPP leader should be disqualified under Article 62 of the Constitution as she failed to declare details of her assets before the ECP, which means she is no longer ‘Sadiq and Ameen’.\nFaryal Talpur owned properties in Larkana and Shahdadkot, and that she had been nominated in a case pertaining to billions of rupees in corruption through fake bank accounts, the petition stated.\nOn the last hearing, the counsel of the two sides appeared before the electoral body for final arguments in the case.\n“Talpur didn’t declare her assets properly and concealed facts,” the petitioner’s counsel argued.\n“It is not a case of non-declaration, all assets of my client have been declared,” Talpur’s lawyer argued.\n“Show your record, which will end the case,” told Faryal Talpur’s lawyer to the commission.\nTalpur was elected from the PS 10 Rattodero constituency of Larkana during the 2018 general elections.",
