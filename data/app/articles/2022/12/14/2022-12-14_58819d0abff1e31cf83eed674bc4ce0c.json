  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 14 (APP):\nPrime Minister’s Special Representative for Interfaith Harmony and Middle East Hafiz Muhammad Tahir Mehmood Ashrafi, on Wednesday, while weighing in on the dissolution of provincial assemblies of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, said there was no consensus within the PTI leadership on the said issue as per media reports.\nHe, in an exclusive talk with APP, said ‘Bajwa Doctrine’ took the country to new heights of social, political, economic and religious stability besides defense.\nHe also deplored the character assassination of former Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa, saying it was not acceptable at all as it was against moral ethics and professional norms.\nAshrafi who is also the chairman of Pakistan Ulema Council said it was Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan who used to praise General Bajwa as the ‘most democratic person’ who ever met him in life.\nHe said Imran Khan’s television interviews were living evidence of his ideas regarding the former army chief who helped the PTI government at political, economic and diplomatic fronts.\nAshrafi said the next general elections would decide the future of PTI chief. “If Imran Khan wants the establishment’s intervention for early elections in the country, he should go to the parliament and make amendments in the law that from onwards, the affairs of elections would be decided by the armed forces instead of the political parties.\nAshrafi said the application of Arshad Sharif’s mother apparently did not address the core issue – justice for the slain journalist. He hailed the Supreme Court’s direction to form a Joint Investigation Team to thoroughly probe the whole incident. There should be fair investigations so that his mother and other family members get justice, he added.\nFrom day one, some elements were bent upon politicizing the issue and maligning the institutions for their ulterior motives, he said adding that the whole nation was unanimous that Arshad Sharif’s killers must be brought to justice.",
