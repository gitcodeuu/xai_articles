The matter was deferred for further deliberation.\nWhile taking briefing by the Director General (Estate) on the detail of the allottees of the Federal Lodge, Islamabad along with their names, designation, computerized national identity cards (CNICs), date of allotment, rent per day, maximum period allowed under the Rules and the period after the maximum period expired; the Committee again sought report while also including the date of births of the allottees.\nOn details of whether certificate for having no residence in the name of the officials and their spouses are furnished by the officers before allotment of E-type or above category government accommodation, matter is sub judice in the court.\nWhile giving detail briefing by the Director General (FGEHA) on the present status of Sectors F-14 and F-15, it was discussed in detail issues of total number of land, number of allottees so far and no. of allottees left.\nThe committee also sought report on tendering and bidding process including details of the advertisement. The DG Housing Authority said that, we have also accepted the land sharing and land value enhancement formula on behalf of local people, and have approved PC-1 of this project, made belt and also made a lot of progress. Senator Saifullah Abro inquired on the present details of how the contract for the development of this project was given to FWO, to which the DG Housing Authority informed that the FWO was mobilized after the court stopped the work. He further informed that the contractor has been mobilized; the development work of this project will be completed in 18 months.\nThe matter of the ongoing Arbitration on the Kashmir Avenue Apartments, an amicable settlement based on an alternative proposal to reduce the burden of escalation on the allottees must be proposed to the Arbitrator; was also discussed at length. The committee lamented that the contract agreement has not been complied with and grieved the malafide intent of the FGEHA on the misuse of the authority on the arbitration after the termination of the contract. The committee sought detail about the correspondence of the agreement and recommended to halt the process of NIT for retendering the process; however the committee also believed that instead of halting the process it should be expedited since many allottees are being effected because of the delay. The matter was deferred for further deliberation.\nThe Committee inquired about the matter of meeting with the D.G (FGEHA), representatives of SCBA with the local community and about an amicable solution, the forum was apprised that since the property has divided ownership, the main issue is of enhancing the mortgage rates however after the award the rates cannot be increased, he said that FGEHA is ready to release cheques of the effectees at the rate of Rs 3.4 million.\nThe Secretary Housing and works informed the committee that we have had meetings with the main guarantor owner of the disputed land.
