  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 6 (APP): Pakistan on Tuesday deeply regretted the non-issuance of visa to its blind cricket team by India for participation in the third T-20 World Cup Cricket Tournament for the Blind.\n“As a result of the Indian decision, Pakistani players would be deprived of the opportunity to participate in an international sporting event of special significance,” the Foreign Office Spokesperson said in a press release.\nThis reflected India’s insensitivity towards the promotion of sports meant for differently-abled persons.\nThe tournament is being played in India on December 5-17.\nThe spokesperson further stressed that the sports events must not be politicized, adding that they had conveyed their disappointment to the Indian side.",
