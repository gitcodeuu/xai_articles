The politicians should have contact on sustainable basis and doors for negotiations must not be closed, he stressed.\nEmphasizing the politics of reconciliation, he said for the sake of the country’s interests, the whole leadership should work beyond their political affiliations.\nHe pointed out that under Article-64 of the Constitution, the resignation should be handwritten. “Once it is received, the speaker meets the respective member to ascertain whether or not it was submitted under duress.”\nHe mentioned that several PTI lawmakers had moved courts, which showed that the party had decided to use the move to pressure the government.\nHe said some of the resigning PTI members had applied leave from the House, some others came to the House to just mark just their attendance, while some had already pleaded that their resignations must not be accepted.\nHe said an MNA from Karachi whose resignation was accepted had filed a petition in the Islamabad High Court and submitted an affidavit that he had not resigned.\nHe said that an MNA was a representative of some 600,000 to 700,000 people and before accepting his / her resignation, the speaker must be satisfied that the same was tendered voluntarily not under any duress.\nAnswering the question of Asad Qaiser, the speaker said the National Assembly Secretariat was ready to again write letters to the resigning MNAs. The PTI delegation members replied that they would have to consult the party in that regard.\nThe meeting was held in a very cordial atmosphere. Deputy Speaker Zahid Akram Durrani was also present in the meeting.\nOn the occasion, Fateha was also offered for the departed soul of the grandmother of Zahid Akram Durrani.",
