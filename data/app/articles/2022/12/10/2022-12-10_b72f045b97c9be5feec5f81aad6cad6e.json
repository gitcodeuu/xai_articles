  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 10 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Saturday said the acquittal of Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah in the narcotics case proved that the previous government had carried out the “worst” political victimisation.\nThe prime minister, in a statement, thanked Allah Almighty over “innocent” Rana Sanaullah’s acquittal by a special court in Lahore and those who used to swear on Allah and his Holy Prophet (PBUH) should seek forgiveness from Allah.\n“The frivolous case of narcotics against Rana Sanaullah is the worst example of political victimisation. Despite facing political victimisation, Rana Sanaullah never uttered a word of complaint,” the prime minister said.\nHe said the time had drawn a clear line between truth and falsehood, genuine and forged, and innocent and sinful.\nHe paid homage to the party leaders including Rana Sanaullah and leaders of other political parties for boldly facing the “worst” political victimisation.\n“The frivolous narcotics case against Rana Sanaullah and his acquittal is also an example to make the people know lies told by the previous government and the committed baseless incrimination.\nSeparately on his Twitter handle, the prime minister said that of all PML-N leaders targeted by Niazi’s regime, Rana Sanaullah’s case was worst example of political persecution with the most dangerous repercussions.\n“He braved these heinous charges & repression with patience & remained steadfast. He is an inspiration for all political workers,” he posted in a tweet.",
