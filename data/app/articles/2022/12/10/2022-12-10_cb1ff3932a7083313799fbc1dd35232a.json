  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 10 (APP):Mushaal Hussein Mullick, Chairperson of Peace and Culture Organization and wife of jailed Kashmiri Hurriyat Leader Yasin Malik, on Saturday said the international community had to understand that peace was not possible in the region without the resolution of Kashmir dispute.\nShe was addressing a ceremony organized by the Islamabad Bar Council in connection with World Human Rights Day. The event was also attended by office bearers of bar councils and a large number of lawyers.\nReferring to the situation in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK), she said there was a region in the world where humans were being treated worse than animals.\nMushaal said pellet guns, which were prohibited to be used even on animals, were also used on Kashmiris by the Indian forces.\nShe said the United Nations emphasized human rights worldwide but, unfortunately, it was completely silent on the violation of human rights in the IIOJK. Disrespecting women in occupied Kashmir was a daily practice of the Indian army, she added.\nMushaal said humanity was being humiliated in occupied Kashmir for decades as millions of Kashmiris had been martyred by the Indian army, and IIOJK had turned into the biggest prison in the world.\nShe said thousands of women had been widowed and children became orphans due to the atrocities of Indian forces in the region.\nIndia was changing the population ratio in the IIOJK and Kashmiris were being robbed of their land to make them financially weak, she added.",
