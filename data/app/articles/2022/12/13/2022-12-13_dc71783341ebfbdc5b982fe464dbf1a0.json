  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 13 (APP): The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in Pakistan along with the National Forum of Women with Disabilities (NFWWD) on Tuesday organized a national summit on the empowerment of women with disabilities to highlight the challenges and opportunities for their growth.\nThe summit was also held to assess the current situation of women with disabilities in Pakistan and other aspects.\nAddressing the summit, speakers said that in Pakistan, which is ranked 147 among 188 countries in the Gender Inequality Index, women with disabilities are a largely overlooked minority.\nThe summit brought together over 100 participants, including representatives from government authorities as well as humanitarian and development organizations to chart a way forward on a more disability inclusive environment in the country.\n“A barrier-free environment is central in assisting women with disabilities reach their full potential and achieve autonomy,” said Abia Akram, CEO NFWWD.\nShe said this cannot be done without including the voice of these women in mainstream gender and disability decision-making processes.\n“Immediate realization of efforts is needed for inclusion of girls and women with disabilities in all walks of life in Pakistan,” said Mohammad Iqbal, the advisor on disability inclusion at the ICRC.\nHe said that this includes their engagement through advocacy, capacity-building programs, and creating a space for meaningful collaboration with the government multilateral agencies.\nThe participants emphasized the need for systematic efforts for the segregation of data to design inclusive policies and service delivery based on targeted individual and environmental requirements.\nThey also discussed prevalent challenges, shared best practices, and made recommendations for a way forward to enable full participation of women and girls with disabilities as well as ways to combat stigma and discrimination.\nThe discussions led to the creation of an action plan for the promotion of capacity building, advocacy and partnerships to facilitate the inclusion of girls and women with disabilities and their representative organizations in decision-making and policy formulation.\n“It is important to understand the nuances of exclusion from the perspective of women and girls who are living with a physical disability in Pakistan. We’re thankful to the ICRC for attempting to fill this gap through this dialogue,” said Fouzia Luni, a participant in the event.\nThe ICRC’s Disability Vision 2030, aims to design and deliver inclusive, accessible, safe, dignified and people-centric initiatives including targeted physical rehabilitation services, ensure an enabling work environment for people with disabilities, and contribute to a legal and policy environment that promotes their inclusion in humanitarian activities.",
