The economy stagnates and a human tragedy ensues, he added.\nAgha Hassan Baloch said that every incident brings opportunities along with devastation and COVID has also given the world an opportunity to formulate a sustainable policy to cope with the future emergencies on equal footing.\nA social contract should be established that protects rights on an equal basis and creates equal opportunities for the development of all nations along with freedom and respect.\nThe federal minister termed the exchange of information about epidemics at the regional, national and global level as imperative for prevention and cure.\nHe said that better education and scientific research are effective means of dealing with these diseases.  “We must have an integrated health system to deal with epidemics and must be ready to face any emergency situations.”, he said.\nThis health system should not only be limited to human life but also to the extent of protection of plants, crops and animals which is essential for human life.\nThe federal minister distributed shields and prizes among the five candidates from across the country in the poster competition held at the Pakistan Academy of Sciences (PAS).",
