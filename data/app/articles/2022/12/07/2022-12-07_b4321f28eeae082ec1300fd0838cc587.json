  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Dec 7 (APP): POWERCHINA has donated funds, repaired roads and agricultural infrastructure and helped local employees affected by the floods and heavy monsoon rains.\nPOWERCHINA said in a statement on Wednesday that it has also played a leading role in donating money to the flood-affected people in Pakistan, and received a positive response and strong support from the Association.\nGiving details of the aid and relief activities, it said the first batch of donations was raised on 26th August for the flood-affected Pakistani to rebuild their homes.\nAfter the first timely donation, as the disaster continued to worsen, in response to the call of the Pakistani government, POWERCHINA made a further donation of USD 104,000 to the Prime Minister’s Flood Relief Fund on October 21.\nPOWERCHINA also participated in the second round of donations to the Chinese Embassy and APCEA. The Chinese staff enthusiastically and spontaneously donated tents worth about Rs 2 million and officially handed over to the Islamabad Women Chamber of Commerce & Industry and to a Balochistan-based party at the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan on December 1.In the face of the sudden flooding, Diamer Basha Dam Project was also seriously affected by the flooding.\nThe project department responded quickly to the flooding, and after surveying the affected site, formulated a relief plan and sent a rescue team with excavators and other large machinery and equipment to participate in the rescue and relief work, helping local villagers to clean up the collapsed road sections, to remove the hazards off the road and backfill the irrigation canal foundation. After four days of reconstruction, the 8 km of collapsed roads were cleared and the main road to the nearby villages was restored, thus helping the locals to get out of the trouble.\nAffected by secondary disasters such as landslides and triggered by floods, many sections of the Karakorum Highway, the main road to and from the project construction site, were either eroded or actively closed, and the construction and logistical materials required for the project could not be delivered to the site for quite some time.\nThe project manager said, “The tougher it is, the more courageous we have to be.” Despite the extremely difficult times, the project is still actively assuming social responsibility, demonstrating the responsibility and commitment of a “great power”.“Our ability is limited, but we want to do our bit to help this country,”the project staff said.\nIn addition, POWERCHINA has taken an initiative to collect and understand the disaster situation of local employees and their families and has helped nearly one thousand employees to return to their hometowns.\nFor the hundreds of employees who could not return to their hometowns due to road blockage, POWERCHINA has provided free accommodation and food to relieve their worries.",
