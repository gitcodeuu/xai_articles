The booklet contains descriptions of all the pro-women laws introduced in Pakistan to provide guidance to women in Pakistan.\nThe Minister regretted that in the past women were not given equal representation as a result the country could not progress. However, he said that now women’s participation is more in various fields, particularly in the education sector.\nThe enrollment of female students is more as compared to the male students which is a positive sign, said the Minister, while highlighting the significance of women’s participation in the development of the country.\nAccording to the latest research report by the digital rights foundation, 40% of women in Pakistan have been victims of cyberbullying in the form of sexual harassment, blackmailing, hate speech, stalking, identity theft and physical threats.\nWhile highlighting the women’s rights protected by Islam, the Minister said that Islam is the only religion that empowered women by giving them equal rights.\nLack of education is directly associated with violence against women but recent high-profile cases show that women in elite and educated circles suffer at the hands of educated and rich men, he added.\nVice Chancellor, RWC Dr. Anila Kamal in her remarks appreciated the Ministry of Planning Commission for successfully completing this much-needed campaign which helped in creating awareness among the masses.\nRWU will continue to collaborate with the Ministry for creating awareness among the masses, she added.\n“We are committed to the cause of women’s education believing that it is the tool to fight GBV and make them economically independent,” remarked the VC.",
