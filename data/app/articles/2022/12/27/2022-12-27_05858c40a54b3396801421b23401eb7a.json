Babar Awan and Ali Nawaz Awan represented the PTI. Mian Aslam argued before the bench of behalf of Jamat-e-Islami (JI).\nThe PML-N in its application, submitted to Islamabad High Court (IHC), pleaded to delay LG polls in the federal capital on the pretext of an increase in the number of union councils. After listening to all the parties in this case the ECP announced to postpone local government elections in Islamabad.\nThe former Attorney General Ashtar Ausaf told the court that the Islamabad administration had recommended to increase the number of UCs in the federal capital population.\nAshtar Ausaf argued that the increase in union councils was inevitable due to the increase in the population of the federal capital.\nAshtar, to a question, replied that the Statistics Division has conveyed the increase in the population of the federal capital and Islamabad High Court has also admitted the surge in population of the federal capital. Ashtar said the federal government has already given legal cover to increased UCs. ECP is now required to conduct delimitation of constituencies afresh.\nCEC Sinkadar Sultan Raja said delimitation has already been done in the federal capital twice. Government should have increased the number of UCs earlier before the announcement of the election schedule.\nECP’s short order shared by the spokesperson, “Keeping in view the legal provisions and the judgment of the High Court regarding the matter. Local government election in Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT) is hereby postponed for the time being.”\nEarlier, Islamabad high court (IHC) declared the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) decision to increase Islamabad Union Councils (UCs) null and void.\nThe Islamabad High Court (IHC) ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan’s (ECP) to hear the arguments from all the parties in this case again.",
