Ms Khar had been assigned the responsibilities as a cabinet member on merit, she reiterated.\nRight from Ms Fatima Jinnah to Kalsoom Nawaz and Najma Hameed, she said, the women had given sacrifices for the strengthening of democracy. They were all pride of Pakistan.\nAbout the recent Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) conference, Marriyum said Ms Khar was the only woman minister among 48 countries, which was an honour for Pakistan.",
