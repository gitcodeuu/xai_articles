What happened to the commitment to give one million jobs and building five million housing units, she said while taking a jibe on PTI leadership.\nShe said that Imran was only “committed” to loot and plunder, telling lies and fraud.\nShe said Imran’s “commitment” was only to get foreign funding, steal the Tosha Khana gifts, and bankrupt Pakistan’s economy.\nMarriyum said that the “commitment” of Imran was only to plunge the country into historic debt and push the people into unprecedented inflation.\nShe said Imran’s “commitment” was only to make a compromise over Kashmir and sell national interests.",
