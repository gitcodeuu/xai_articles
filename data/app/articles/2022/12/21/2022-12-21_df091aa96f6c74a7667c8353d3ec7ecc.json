Zardari’s lawyer Farooq H. Naek and NAB prosecutor Sohail Arif appeared before the court.Giving arguments during the hearing, Naek said that Asif Zardari had nothing to do with the reference.\nAfter the amendments in the NAB ordinance, the accountability court had no jurisdiction to hear this case.\nHe prayed the court to give decision on the application as per the law.\nAfter listening the arguments, the court returned the reference and instructed to file the case to the relevant forum. The NAB had filed the reference pertaining suspicious transaction worth Rs 8 billions last year.\nThe court also returned the Toshakhana reference against Asif Ali Zardari, PML-N’s Leader Nawaz Sharif and former prime minister Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani.\nThe court said that after the amendment in the NAB Ordinance, a case of an amount less than Rs500 million couldn’t be registered.",
