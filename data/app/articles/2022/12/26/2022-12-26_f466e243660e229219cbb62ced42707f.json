The prime minister said that the federal government had allocated a huge amount of Rs90 billion for the flood affected populace and each affected family was given Rs25,000 each besides, ensuring provision of medicine and food.\nThe magnitude of the disaster was huge, he said, adding on 9 January a donors’ conference would be held in Geneva and they would remind the world that the climate induced calamity was the result of global carbon emissions by the developed nations.\nPakistan had less than one percent of carbon imprints, but it had been pummeled by the extreme weather due to carbon emissions by the development countries, he opined.\nThe prime minister further assured the nation that the federal coalition government in collaboration with the provincial governments, would not rest till the complete rehabilitation of the flood affected people.\nThe prime minister said that construction of Hakla-Yarak motorway which had hugely reduced the travel time from Islamabad to DIKhan had been conceived and implemented by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif.\nHe said the whole country had been connected with a network of motorways and Nawaz Sharif solely deserved credit for the launch of such mega projects, adding that he had laid foundation stone of the last segment of Sukkur-Hyderabad motorway section recently.\nThe prime minister reiterated that dream of Nawaz Sharif for the prosperous Pakistan would be fulfilled.\nHe regretted that during the past PTI’s government, all these uplift projects, initiated during PML-n government, were brought to grinding halt.\nCiting the Hakla-DIKhan motorway, the prime minister said it was part of CPEC conceived during 2017, but the PTI government put these projects into cold storage, thus affecting the development and progress of the country.\nThe prime minister also regretted that due to faulty policies of PTI’s government, the friendly nations including China were displeased.\nIn a veiled reference to former prime minister Imran Khan, he said that PTI leader had brought disrespect to the country after selling out the precious gifts donated by foreign leaders.\nThey gave these precious gifts as sign of fraternal ties with the people of Pakistan, but the former ruler sold them out in open markets, he added.\nThe prime minister said that when he had taken oath, he did not realize the economic disaster towards the country was heading to as Pakistan was on the verge of default, but due to the efforts of the coalition government and all other relevant institutions and prayers of the nation, they saved the country.\nHe said still they were faced with the economic challenges. Pakistan suffered a whopping loss of about $30 billion due to floods and these woes were multiplied by global inflation and recession, Russia and Ukraine conflict and exorbitant price of gas and oil at the international market.\nHe regretted that Imran Khan had no concerns for the public welfare and his past government had never accorded any priority.\nThe prime minister said the coalition government have still eight months’ tenure left and after that period, elections would be held in the country.\nIn the general elections, the public would decide, he said, whether they would vote for the man who sold precious watches and in the habit of levelling false allegations or for those people who served them.\nHe further expressed the optimism that they would change fate of Pakistan, as it was destined for fast-paced progress and prosperity.\nEnumerating the uplift projects, the prime minister said that he had laid foundation stones of different billions worth projects including Yarak to Zhob segment, restoration of Chashma Right Bank Canal, restoration of its 8 power units that would generate 180MW of power, Lakki Marwat university and the dams which had been vital for the prosperity of the area.\nHe also directed the chairman WAPDA to implement these hydel projects in the shortest period with a well devised strategy.\nHe also cited construction of the new airport which would provide travel facility to the residents of the area.\nThe prime minister also praised the relevant institutions and the armed forces for their contributions and efforts during floods in the flood devastated districts.\nThe prime minister also expressed his concerns over the rise of terrorists’ incidents in the province including the one in Bannu and lauded the sacrifices and successful operation launched by the special services unit and the law enforcement agencies to eliminate terrorists.\nHe said the security personnel who had laid down their lives for the motherland would be always remembered for their valour and bravery.\nThe prime minister also expressed his grief and sorrow over loss of security personnel in Balochistan in the terrorist attack.\nHe informed that he would be soon chairing a meeting to consider the situation.\nAddressing the ceremony, Minister for Communications and Postal Services Maulana Asad Mahmood said the prime minister had restarted the journey of progress and development which was initiated by former prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and had been stalled by the former government of PTI.\nAdvisor to the PM Engineer Amir Muqam, in his speech, said that construction of motorway from Yarak to Hakla had reduced the travel time between Islamabad and the southern districts of the province.\nThe credit for alleviation of sense of deprivation among the people of this area went to Muhammad Nawaz Sharif and the prime minister, he added.\nHe also criticized Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf chief Imran Khan for taking U-turns and constantly telling lies over various issues.\nAmir of JUI-F Maulana Fazlur Rehman, in his address, said the prime minister’s visit to lay foundation stones of various development projects, reflected his affection for the backward areas of the province.\nHe highlighted the importance of the CPEC route linking DIKhan division with Gwadar and the rest of the country. The area was fast turning into a major trade and transit center for the global trade, he said, and stressed upon establishment of industrial zones in the area.\nMaulana Fazal further said the policies of the previous government of PTI had brought the country to the brink of disaster.\nHuge development projects were launched by the PML-N government, overseas Pakistanis started sending remittances, and the global partners were investing in Pakistan, but unfortunately all these hit snags in the past government’s tenure, he added.\nHe said the merged districts of the tribal areas required fast paced development projects so that they could be brought at par with the other developed areas of the country.\nIf the available water resources in the area were fully utilized, they would turn about 1,200,000 acres of land into agrarian land, he added.\nThe JUI-F amir said that attempts were made to create upheaval in the country with economic uncertainty, but these would be foiled.\nHe said they would have to make efforts for regaining the erstwhile prestige among the comity of nations.\nMaulana Lutfur Rehman, MPA, said that JUI-F had always strived for the solidarity of the country and strongly resisted and condemned any attempts to create chaos in the society.\nWhile enroute to DIKhan, the prime minister also took an aerial view of the area and was briefed about the development projects.",
