The skin-to-skin contact provides warmth and prevents hypothermia. It is medically beneficial for the baby and good for parent-child bonding, Dr. Inoussa said.\nPreterm birth is one of the three leading causes for neonatal mortality and accounts for more than one third of all newborn deaths in Pakistan. Globally, preterm birth is one of the leading causes of child deaths under age 5 as almost 15 million babies in the world are born prematurely and nearly 1 million die due to related complications.\nAcross 184 countries, the rate of preterm birth ranges from 5% to 18% of babies born. Small and sick newborns, most of whom are born preterm, have the highest risk of death and contribute to the majority of the world’s disabled children.KMC has now been increasingly recognized as a cost-effective intervention to save preterm infants.\nKMC was introduced in Pakistan by the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) since 2017 to curtail the high infant mortality rate in the country. UNICEF in collaboration with the Ministry of National Health Services, Regulations and Coordination and provincial health departments has supported establishment of 41 Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) units across the country (21 in Punjab, 7 in Sindh, 4 in KP, 1 in Balochistan, 3 in GB, 2 in KPK, and 3 in ICT).\nUNICEF has provided all the necessary equipment and materials to help train staff from Gynae/Obstetric and Neonatology units on KMC. An element of Supportive Supervision has also been incorporated to help enhance quality of care for the newborns and thousands of precious newborn lives have been saved.\nThe Government of Pakistan and its development partners are trying to reduce preterm births and new-born mortality due to related complications such as Birth Asphyxia, Prematurity and Sepsis. These efforts have contributed to reduce new-born mortality from 55 to 42 deaths per 1,000 live births during the last five years. It has also had a remarkable impact on morbidity in preterm newborns.",
