  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 3 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Thursday advised the masses and media to avoid speculations and giving irresponsible statements in the wake of firing incident aimed at Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan during his long march, which reached Wazirabad, at the time of such a “sad” incident.\nAddressing a news conference, she strongly condemned the firing at Imran Khan and other PTI leaders, praying for their swift recovery.\n“Pakistan cannot afford such incidents and it is imperative that the political arena should not be turned into a bloody one,” she said, while calling for the collective efforts which were crucial to change such behaviours.\nMarriyum advised the media to avoid speculation and airing irresponsible statements on the incident until the facts or a preliminary report was shared by the Punjab government and police.\nShe said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had directed Interior Minister Rana Sana Ullah to seek a preliminary report from the Inspector General and Chief Secretary Punjab and extend all-out support to the provincial government in this regard.\nThe minister said the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of Punjab, so the provincial police, as well as the administration and other relevant departments, should share the facts with the masses immediately after its investigation.\nMarriyum said the accused had been arrested and his statement was being recorded in Gujrat Police Station. He had confessed that he had fired at Imran Khan for certain reasons which were being aired on the media.\nShe said the Punjab police should cordon off the crime scene as it was imperative for completing the incident’s investigation.\nThe minister appealed the masses to avoid politicizing the incident and commenting on it in irresponsible way as provoking\nstatements and words over such incidents may lead to an untoward incident.\nShe said a female leader of PTI stated that Rana Sana Ullah was involved in the assassination attempt. These were the statements, words, and violent mindset which caused such unfortunate incidents.\nThose statements which could create anarchy and provoke violence and hatred should be avoided, she said, adding there was a need to learn a lesson from such incidents.",
