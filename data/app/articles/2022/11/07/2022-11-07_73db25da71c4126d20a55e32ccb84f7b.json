It is being celebrated within the International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development, which kicked off on July 08.\n‘ The applications of basic sciences are vital for advances in medicine, industry, agriculture, water resources, energy planning, environment, communications and culture’, affirmed the United Nations General Assembly on December 2, 2021, when it endorsed the proposal for an International Year of Basic Sciences for Sustainable Development. World Science Day is contributing to the Year 2022 by celebrating this theme.\n“We need more basic science to achieve.\nThe 2030 agenda and its 17 Sustainable Development Goals”, the United Nations General Assembly noted in December 2021.\nIt is true that the share of domestic research expenditure devoted to basic sciences varies widely from one country to another. According to data from the UNESCO Science Report 2021 for 86 countries, some devote less than 10% of their research expenditure to basic sciences and others more than 30%.\nHaving a capacity in basic sciences is in the interests of both developed and developing countries, given the potential for applications to foster sustainable development and raise standards of living.",
