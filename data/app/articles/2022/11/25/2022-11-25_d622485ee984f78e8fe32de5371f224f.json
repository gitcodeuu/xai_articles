They come to see our factory, and for business meetings. Therefore, it is very important that the infrastructure of the city like roads, railways, airports, and dry ports, should be up to mark”.\nIt was highlighted that the ADB is helping develop growing cities like Sialkot so public services can meet rising demand.\nWater infrastructure is being upgraded for reliable supply, while sewerage and sanitation systems are also being rehabilitated.\nWithe the ADB’s help, over 450 tons of waste are effectively collected every day and communities are taught better waste management.\nSocial Activist, Sialkot, Farkhanda Ishtiaq said “We learned about solid waste management at home.
