  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 29 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Tuesday said that due to difficult decisions taken by the coalition government, Pakistan was out of the risks of default.\nThe prime minister said the government was taking all possible steps to further strengthen the national economy and was striving with priority measures to reduce price hike and provide relief to the common people.\nThe prime minister expressed these views while talking to a delegation of Jefferies, a leading global investment banking and capital markets firm. Minister for Finance Ishaq Dar was also present during the meeting.\nThe prime minister regretted that unfounded rumours were being spread about the economy of Pakistan and reprehensible efforts were being made to create havoc.\nHe said the coalition government without caring for the political price, saved the country from the repercussions of the previous four years’ maladministration by the former government.\nHe also reiterated that the government was making efforts to reduce the foreign trade deficit and providing all possible facilities to the foreign investors.\nWelcoming the delegation, the prime minister invited the firm to open its office in Pakistan.\nThe delegation termed the economic recovery of Pakistan as a good sign under the leadership of prime minister that faced the economic challenges in an effective manner and put the country on the path of economic stability.",
