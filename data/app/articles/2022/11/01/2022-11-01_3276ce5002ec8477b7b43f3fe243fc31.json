  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 01 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb Tuesday said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) knew how to deal with the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s (PTI) long march which was aimed at creating chaos and anarchy in the country.\n“Imran Khan’s long march will be sent packing before it would make it to Islamabad,” she said while talking to the media on the political situation and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s visit to China.\nShe said the PTI had planned to turn the long march into “bloody march, but the government would protect the citizens’ life and property at all cost.\nImran Niazi wanted to get a date of fresh election through “bloodshed, abuses, guns and bloody revolution”, which was near to impossible, she remarked.\nHe was bent upon on dividing the nation and creating the anarchy, she said, adding Imran Khan wanted a martial law in the country as he had already hatched a conspiracy to pit the police forces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa against the police of Federal Capital.\nShe said democracy would flourish in the country and the masses would be served in the best possible way.Marriyum said the statements of Imran Khan showed his desperation to regain the power.\nHe wanted anarchy, chaos and bloodshed instead of democracy, peace and development in the country.\nShe criticized the PTI chief for openly asking the institutions to interfere in politics by ousting a democratically elected government.\nThe general elections would be held on time, and after the completion of the current government’s term, she added.The minister said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had announced a historic Kissan package for the development of agriculture sector, adding the directives had been passed on to the relevant departments for early implementation of the initiative.\nImran Niazi was an ‘autocrat’ who had received the certificate of corruption and incompetency by ruling the country for four years, she alleged.\n“When a verdict come against his will he [Imran] started threatening the state institutions,” she said, adding the people knew the fascist mindset of Imran Niazi and the real truth behind the so-called revolution.\nMarriyum said Imran Khan who used to call others thieves could not prove a single allegation against Nawaz Sharif, Shahbaz Sharif, Hamza Shahbaz, Maryam Nawaz, Ahsan Iqbal, Rana Sanaullah, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Miftah Ismail during his tenure.\nHe [Imran] filed fake cases and accused PML-N leaders including Hanif Abbasi, Salman Rafiq and Saad Rafiq of corruption, but failed to produce a single evidence in the country of law, the minister claimed.\nAs regards the prime minister’s visit to China, the minister was confident that it would give impetus to the CPEC envisioned by Chinese President Xi Jinping and former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.\nShe regretted that the multi-billion corridor project [CPEC] was halted in the last four years by the PTI government, adding not even a single meeting of the Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) was held during its tenure.\nShe said the present government had removed all the obstacles in the way of Chinese investment and put all the halted projects on track.\nMarriyum said ironically, Imran Khan once again launched a long march to spread chaos and anarchy when the prime minister left for China to further strengthen the bilateral relations.\nIn a past, Imran Khan sabotaged President Xi Jinping’s visit to Pakistan by launching a long march in 2014, she said, adding Imran Khan exposed himself whenever he boarded on the container.\nShe said Imran Niazi’s reaction to Ali Amin Khan Gandapur leaked audio showed that his long march could lead to an untoward incident.\nWhen Imran Niazi was the prime minister, she said he had the constitutional authority to hold the general elections, but he did not do so.\nNow he [Imran] thinks that his tactics of bullying, threatening and abusing will help him get a date for the early election but it will not happen at all,” she added.\nThe minister said 1500 to 2000 people could not decide the fate of the entire country as the nation of 220 million wanted supremacy of the constitution and the law.\nShe said Imran Niazi did not have a single word to speak on his government’s performance.\nThe prime minister’s visit to China would prove to be a milestone for CPEC, new accords would be signed with focus on the progress of on ongoing project.\nThe Chinese president, the minister said had been a true friend of Pakistan and his support for the people of Pakistan and the country towards development and other spheres was remarkable.",
