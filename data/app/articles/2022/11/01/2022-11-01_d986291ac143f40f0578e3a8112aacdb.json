  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 31 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Monday said Imran Khan was a “coward man” who could only hurl hollow threats.\nShe, in a news statement, said Imran Khan should explain to whom he was threatening while delivering speeches on the container during his long march toward Islamabad.\nMarriyum said Imran Khan was simultaneously behaving in an aggressive and respectful way which showed that he was frustrated and in mental disarray.\nShe said Imran Khan was a “foreign funded Fitna” who had admitted to bring revolution in the country through bloodshed. The Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chief also admitted that he wanted martial law in the country.\nThe minister said Imran Khan’s long march received a lukewarm response from public. He should know that some 2,000 people did not represent the entire nation of 220 million.\nShe said humiliation and disgrace had been written in the fate of “foreign funded Fitna” and “thief of Toshakhana”.\nMarriyum said there was nothing but humiliation for Imran Khan who had offered lifetime extension to the head of an institution for saving his government.\nShe castigated Imran Khan for openly asking the institutions to interfere in the politics by ousting a democratically elected government.",
