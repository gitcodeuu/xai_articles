They also assured providing copies of draft rules to the ECP, District Election Commissioners and Deputy Commissioners.\nThe CEC said that the elections have not yet been held in Punjab province only due to frequent changes in elections laws and other delaying tactics used by the successive provincial governments.\nBriefing the meeting, Secretary Election Commission said that the tenure of local government in Punjab has already ended on January 1, 2022. ECP has completed the delimitation task for holding LG polls twice due to changes in LG laws.\nNow the provincial government has notified Punjab Local Government Act on Nov 16, 2022.\nECP was going to start the delimitation process afresh under the new law. But the provincial government has not yet notified Punjab Local Government Delimitation Rules and Punjab Local Government Conduct of Election Rules despite the fact that the provincial government was bound to cooperate with the election commission in light of the constitution, law and directives of the Supreme Court of Pakistan.\nECP Secretary asked the forum to bound the provincial government to immediately provide relevant rules, maps and relevant data to the commission to enable it to initiate the delimitation process.",
