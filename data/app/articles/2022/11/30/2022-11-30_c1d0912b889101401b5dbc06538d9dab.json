Among them, 163 Afghans were migrant children while as many as 237 were local.\nThe speakers said that the education department has been fully supporting the out-of-school children while non-government organizations are also playing their part.\nIn this connection, efforts are afoot for the capacity building of the teachers while teaching materials have also been provided to the educational institutes.\nThey noted that children are also been sensitized how to deal with harassment and negative social attitudes. Besides, an education information management system has been established to continuously review the situation.\n“Comprehensive proposals have been formulated to discourage the practice of punishing children so as to remove the fear of school in children and restore their confidence,” they maintained.\nIn addition, one hundred special children have been identified in the project area under the referral mechanism; they will be referred to concerned institutions.\nThe speakers further vowed that the concerted strategy adopted for the admission of out-of-school children in the Pak-Afghan border town will continue with the same spirit.",
