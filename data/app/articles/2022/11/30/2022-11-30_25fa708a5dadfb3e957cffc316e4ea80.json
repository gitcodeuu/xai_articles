Imran Khan had exhausted all his political options and was now left with no other political move.\n“In his free time, Imran Khan should declare all the gifts which he sold after illegally purchasing from Toshakhana and also file the defamation case which he announced after refuting all the facts regarding the matter as mere accusations,” she continued.\nShe said Imran Khan knew that he would have to answer about all the Toshakhana gifts if he filed the defamation case in this regard.\nThe minister recalled that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif filed a defamation case against Imran Khan for hurling accusations in the Panama case, but failed to submit his reply in the court to date. Now, the court would decide the matter if he failed to submit his reply.\nMarriyum said Imran Khan just wanted to spread “political instability, chaos, anarchy and polarization in the country as part of his unfinished agenda”.\nHis so-called “Haqeeqi Azadi” (Real Freedom) had been exposed before the public, she said, adding “Haqeeqi Azadi” could not be achieved by hiring the services of a US-based lobbying firm for improving the party’s image.\nShe said every lie of Imran Khan got exposed gradually, especially, after the leaked audios in which he could be heard discussing the strategy to create a narrative over the so-called regime change conspiracy, “buying votes to defeat the no-confidence motion against him, and asking a provincial finance minister to write a letter to the IMF”.\nThe minister said the coalition government was committed to resolving the people’s issues and ensuring their well-being.\n“Our entire focus is on carrying out rehabilitation and reconstruction phase in the flood-affected areas and reversing the damage caused by Imran Khan to the country at internal and external fronts while being in power for four years,” she said.\nShe said Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was working tirelessly to restore the image of the country at the international level through effective diplomacy.\nThe minister asked Imran Khan to stop the drama of “Haqeeqi Azadi” and give answers about the economic mess created by him during the last four years while in the government.\nTo another query, she said Imran Khan launched the long march to topple the current government, but ended it with the announcement of dissolving his own governments in different provinces.\n“We are ready for every kind of eventuality and will compete with him (Imran) in a befitting way,” she remarked.\nThe people needed to understand that “inflation and terrorism were outcomes of the (mis)governance of the Imran-led government”, she said, adding that terrorism was completely rooted out during the previous tenure of Nawaz Sharif who launched the National Action Plan by bringing all the political parties including PTI at the table.\nTo another query, she said unfortunately, propaganda was launched over the issue of broadcast rights of the FIFA world cup for PTV Sports. The inquiry over the matter was completed and details would be shared with the media soon.\nThe minister said during the past few months the present government was in talks with FIFA management and hopefully PTV would telecast the matches of the World Cup live.\nAt the outset of briefing, Marriyum said the prime minister had not accepted the resignation of Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazir Tarar and he was requested by cabinet colleagues to withdraw his resignation.\nShe said the whole cabinet appreciated the competence and efficiency of Azam Nazir Tarar as Law Minister and also lauded Sardar Ayaz Sadiq who looked after the Ministry of Law and Justice during his absence.\nThe minister said the cabinet strongly condemned the Buleli suicide attack near Quetta and offered Fateha for those who were martyred in the attack and prayed for the early recovery of the injured.\nShe said that the cabinet lauded the services of all stakeholders, especially the polio workers across the country to make Pakistan a polio-free country.\nThe cabinet, she said, was given a detailed briefing by the Ministry of Food Security and Research on the demand and supply situation of wheat in the country.\nThe minister said the cabinet was informed that as compared to the previous year, two percent morestock of wheat was available in the country.\nShe said that despite unprecedented floods in the country, the sufficient stock was available due to efficient planning and steps were taken to ensure the availability of wheat and other edible crops in all parts of the country.\nShe said that the cabinet also appreciated the efforts of Food Security Minister Tariq Bashir Cheema, and his staff for ensuring the availability of wheat and other edibles despite heavy floods during summer.\nMarriyum said the cabinet gave approval to the proposal of auctioning one of the two buildings in Washington owned by the Pakistan embassy.\nShe said that in 2010, the then-prime minister gave approval for the renovation of these two buildings.\nShe said that the renovation of one of the buildings was completed but only 60 percent work could be completed on the other building.\nThe minister said that the US government had revoked the diplomatic status of the building and so far the government had paid $ 8,19,000 as tax.\nShe said that after 2019 $1.3 million tax had been paid on the building without any use.\nAs the building was not suitable for use due to incomplete renovation and the abolition of its diplomatic status, she said the cabinet approved the proposal to auction the building.\nShe said in the past $ 4.5 million bid was given but now a bid of $ 6.9 million has been given which was $2.3 million higher than the previous one.\nShe said if Pakistan did not auction the said building, the United States would itself auction it.\nShe said that the cabinet gave approval for the auction of the said building following a transparent manner.\nMarriyum said that regarding the Bhara Kahu bypass issue, the Islamabad High Court directives have been implemented.\nShe said that the ministerial committee headed by Sardar Ayaz Sadiq listened to the proposals of all stakeholders and succeeded in building a consensus among all stakeholders on the issue.\nShe said that the committee presented its proposals in the meeting which were approved bythe cabinet and would be presented in the IHC.",
