He said renewable energy is the future of Pakistan.\n“The government is going to start a 10,000 MW solar power project soon while completion of Sukki Kinari power projects by the end of next year,” he said.\n“Huge coal reserves of Thar have a great potential and we are using water technology to produce electricity with minimum environmental impacts while work on K-II and K-III are another source of clean and low-cost energy,” he added.\nHe said the production cost of renewable energy is less than fossil fuels and consumer tariffs of electricity will gradually reduce.\nChairman Gul Ahmed and Metro group of companies Danish Iqbal, British Deputy High Commissioner at Karachi and Director of Trade Sarrah Moooney, Managing Director National Transmission and Dispatch Company, Rana Abdul Jabbar, and Chief Executive Officer Alternate Energy Development Board Shahjahan Mirza also addressed the inaugural ceremony.",
