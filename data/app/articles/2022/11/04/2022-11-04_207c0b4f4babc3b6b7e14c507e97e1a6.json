For God sake, leave the political and religious extremism and resolve the issues through talks,” he emphasized.\nAshrafi made it clear that those who campaigned against the Inter-Services Intelligence and Pakistan Army did not get anything except disgrace.\nQuoting the example of Libya, Iraq, Syria and Egypt, he alarmed that Pakistan could be weak due to chaos in the country.",
