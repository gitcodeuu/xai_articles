There were growing restrictions on media, a number of journalists and human rights defenders had been arrested on spurious terrorism charges, and authorities regularly harassed critics, including through the use of counterterrorism raids,” the HRW observed.\nThe human rights organizations observed that the Dalit communities were subjected to violent search and seizure operations, falsified charges, caste-based verbal abuse, severe beatings, inhuman torture, and sexual abuse following arrest.\nThe world body was told that many Adivasi/Tribal women in the custody of the police or other authorities were raped or sexually abused and during the UPR cycle, there had been a rampant misuse of counterterrorism legislation to persecute human rights defenders, journalists and persons critical of the government, such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, the National Security Act and the Jammu & Kashmir Public Safety Act.\nThe UN’s attention was also drawn towards mob violence or lynching by Hindu nationalist vigilante groups targeting minorities with the Amnesty calling for the accountability of public officials who advocated religious hatred.\nThe lawyers’ bodies, in their submission, told the UN that human rights lawyers were the subject of physical attacks in connection to their professional activities.\nAmnesty stated that independent media outlets, journalists and human rights activists were threatened and intimidated through the misuse of over-broad financial laws and censorship of dissenting reportage.\nIt was also reported that peaceful protesters had been charged with offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and the Indian Penal Code, including for sedition, hurting religious sentiments, and hate speech.\nSeveral HR bodies reporting on Dalit community’s rights told the UN that Dalit Christians and Dalit Muslims fared worst in terms of economic conditions.\nSome organisations also highlighted the issues faced by the Indian farmers who were still struggling to get institutional credit and were debt trapped. They stated that in 2020 there had been 10,677 suicides in the farming sector.\nThe UN was told that forced evictions and demolitions of homes of the poor had continued unabated during the COVID-19 pandemic and almost 16 million people were currently threatened with the risk of displacement.\nThey told the United Nations that the prison conditions in India had worsened during the pandemic. Amnesty International stated that two-thirds of the prison population was in pretrial detention, with Dalits, Adivasis and Muslims being disproportionately represented.\nICJ urged the Indian government to amend the Citizenship Amendment Act to guarantee that there was no discrimination based on national origin or religion in access to citizenship.\nThe Human Rights Watch, in its submission, stated that at least 10 states in India forbade forced religious conversion, but in fact misused the laws to target Christians, particularly from Dalit or Adivasi communities. They were also used to harass and arrest Muslim men in relationships with Hindu women.\nThe HRW called for the Modi-led government to repeal directives that ban the hijab, and ensure that schools and universities were inclusive spaces, and safeguard girls’ and women’s right to freedom of religion and expression.\nAmnesty International also highlighted that under BJP government, hate crimes against Muslims and other minorities had surged which were not even recorded in the official statistics.\nThe stakeholders pointed out a “deep-rooted” anti-minority bias among the police force and called for creating avenues for greater minority representation in the police force, civil service, justice institutions, and elected bodies.\nThe stakeholders expressed their concerns over the ongoing violations experienced by Christians in India, including false accusations and arrests, forced conversion to Hinduism, hate campaigns, assault, murder, illegal occupation of churches, forced displacement, disruption of religious gatherings, and vandalism of Christian homes, churches and other church-owned properties.\nThe stakeholders stated that the security forces and police in India had been engaging in extrajudicial killings or fake encounter killings and that the culture of extrajudicial killings was normalised in the country.\nThey stated that custodial torture and violence remained entrenched and routine law-enforcement strategy across India.\nAPP Digital Report by Ishtiaq Ahmed",
