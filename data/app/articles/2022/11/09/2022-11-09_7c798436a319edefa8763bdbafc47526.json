The creation of the motherland had been accomplished by his intellectual efforts, it added.\nBy terming the young generation as Shaheen (Eagle), Iqbal wanted to inculcate in them a lofty idea, passion for action, wide vision and boldness, and also wanted to fully fulfill their curiosity.\nAccording to Iqbal the Shaheen’s life is self-deprecating, curious in its nature and swooping in its habit.\n“He is the only ruler of vast space who loves the skies and heights,” the documentary mentioned the vision of Iqbal for youth as Shaheen.\nThe documentary renewed the pledge that every Shaheen of Pakistan Air Force was always ready to protect the motherland and would not spare any sacrifice if required.",
