  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 19 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Saturday said Imran Khan’s “Tamasha” (political gimmickry) would come to an end on November 26.\nMarriyum, in a news statement, said the end of Imran Khan’s so-called ‘Haqeeqi Azadi March’ would not be different from his long march of 2014.\n“Imran Khan! It is over for you,” she said while indicating “the end” of Imran Khan’s politics.\nShe said instead of urging his workers to reach Rawalpindi on November 26, Imran Khan should better have announced the date for filing cases in the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom over Toshakhana scandal.\nInstead of arriving in Islamabad or Rawalpindi, Imran Khan should book his flight either to the UAE or UK, she added.\nMarriyum said November 26 would too pass and Imran Khan would not have any support “from any quarter”.\nShe regretted that the “fake march” of “Haqeeqi Azadi” had claimed innocent lives, including journalists, and rendered children parentless.\nThe minister lashed out at Imran Khan for allegedly playing with national interests and inflicting severe damage to foreign policy.",
