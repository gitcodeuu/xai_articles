The Corridor was inaugurated on November 9, 2018, allowing visa-free access to Sikh pilgrims from India to visit the holy shrine.\nThe establishment of the Corridor reflected Pakistan’s continued commitment to facilitating Sikh pilgrims and was in line with the government’s efforts to promote religious tourism.\nSince 1947, Sikh community of India and across the world was desirous of the access to the Gurdwara from India because it is just about 4-5 kilometers from Pakistan-India Border. Kartarpur Corridor is functioning under an MoU between Pakistan and India, which allowed 5,000 yatrees to enter from the Indian side on daily basis.\nThe Founder of Sikh Religion Baba Guru Nanak Dev Ji spent the last 18 years of his life at Kartarpur. The Gurdwara is considered to be the most sacred shrine of Sikh religion.\nBaba Nanak was the founder of Sikhism and is the first of the ten Sikh Gurus. His birth is celebrated worldwide as Guru Nanak Gurpurab on Katak Pooranmashi ‘full-moon of Kattak’.\nThe pilgrims will return to the India through Wagha border on November 15.",
