He said the initiative would connect Pakistan with Ethiopia and boost bilateral trade significantly, which currently amounts to 78 million US dollars.\nFounder of JS Bank Jahangir Siddiqui expressed keen interest in business opportunities being offered by Africa and briefed the ambassador about Raast which was Pakistan’s first instant payment system.\nHe assured the ambassador of the representation from his company in the business delegation which would fly to Ethiopia by start of next year.\nMeanwhile, in a separate meeting with a delegation of Arif Habib Limited, the ambassador said there was a huge demand for construction material and fertilizer in his country.\n“It is a big opportunity for Pakistani businessmen who can make profits by entering the Ethiopian market right now,” he maintained.\nThe ambassador assured them of the state guarantee on their investment and said whatever would be invested in Ethiopia would have a return in terms of profit.\nHe said Ethiopia was the fastest growing economy and multiple incentives have been announced for the investors by his government.\n“We are committed to facilitating the investors in our country, that is why we have established a one-window operation for them,” he added.",
