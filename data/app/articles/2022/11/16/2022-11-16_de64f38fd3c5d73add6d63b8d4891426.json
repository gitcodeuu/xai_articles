The minister said climate-resilient infrastructure development was of paramount importance.\nSpeaking on the occasion, IPRI’s Chair of Economic Security Dr Aneel Salman said that every report, policy and speech gives a narrative about economic security but first thought should be given to economic equality.\nDirector of the China Center for Special Economic Zone Research (CCSEZR) of Shenzhen University Dr Tao Yitao said that a majority of capital, technology and information is in hands of few nations with no central government and those who want to take advantage will have to manipulate the international politics by taking advantage of their hegemonic position.\nDean, College of International Studies, Shenzhen University, China Dr Dai Yonghong in his address said that Chinese traditional culture is profound with Taoism and “Taoism” also has strong applicability in today’s international society.\nChief Economist of South Asia, World Bank Hans Timmer while addressing the forum said that the international community was unprepared for climatic and financial shocks and South Asian economies are going through an existential balance of payments crisis.
