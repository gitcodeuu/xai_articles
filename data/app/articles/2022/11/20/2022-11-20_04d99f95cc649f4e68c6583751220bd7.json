  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Nov 20 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Sunday said that Tasneem Haider had no relation with the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N).\n“Tasneem Haider is not a spokesman of PML-N London,” she said in a news statement, and added that nobody should try to become spokesperson of the party.\nMarriyum said Tasneem Haider should produce evidence regarding murder of Arshad Sharif before the Joint Investigation Team, if he had any.\nShe said the person, who hurled allegations in a video clip circulating in different sections of media, was organiser of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI)’s London chapter. “Forgery, lies and fake news cannot divert attention from the real killers of Arshad Sharif,” she stressed.\nThe minister challenged the ARY News to air such news in London. It would not dare to broadcast fake news in London as their management had already been fined for such misadventures in the past, she said.",
