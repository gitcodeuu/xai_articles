Equipped with a suite of testing technology, along with its crew of technicians, the van will provide expert on the spot scientific expertise to help support both consumer confidence, but also public health.\nThrough GRASP, the officials of BFA have also been trained on Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) compliance issues in relation to requirement for wider market access, including towards potential international exports, in addition to supporting and reviewing regulatory and operational frameworks of the authority, towards its overall strengthening and operational capacity.\nSpeaking at the ceremony, Dr Riina Kionka said, “The EU is pleased to hand over the first mobile laboratory testing facility to the Balochistan Food Authority. This is a milestone to be celebrated and the starting point of the future commitment of the Balochistan Government to improving food safety not only in the province, but Pakistan as a whole.”\nProvincial Minister Food Zmarak Khan thanked the EU’s support to the provincial government and recognized the investment made through GRASP, which is working closely with the government which is not only supporting Balochistan SMEs in horticulture and agriculture, but also enhancing the capacity of government institutions through targeted trainings.\nChief Secretary Balochistan Abdul Aziz Uqaili appreciated the support EU has provided to the province and stressed on the close partnership and continued support to provide a safe and healthy environment for SMEs, especially in rural areas to become competitive with the national and global markets.\nThe GRASP is working for poverty reduction and sustainable, inclusive growth through development of rural small and medium-sized enterprises in select districts of Sindh and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan. The project’s outcome aims to enhance the productivity and profitability of SMEs involved in primary production, service provision, and value addition in and around selected clusters of production.",
