They have not only secured a prosperous life for their families but also emerged as role models in their respective communities.\nThardeep Microfinance Institution won the award for the most innovative Micro-finance Institution (MFI), while Telenor Microfinance Bank and the Kashf Foundation were the runner-ups in this category.\nThe winner for the national micro-finance (female) category is Ms Sumera Arzoo who was a borrower from the CSC Empowerment and Inclusion Programme, while Mr. Abdul Ghaffar bagged the award for national micro-finance (male) category who availed financing from Khushhali Microfinance Bank Ltd.\nSima Kamil, Deputy Governor, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), on the occasion commended all the community members who have established small businesses with the help of micro loans. In her message, she exclaimed that she was immensely happy to note that almost 60% of award winners are women.\n“The State Bank of Pakistan recognizes micro-finance as an effective tool for an inclusive financial system as it gives access to those socio-economic segments, especially enterprises, who are otherwise neglected.\nThe SBP has enhanced the limit for micro enterprises and micro housing from 1 million to 3 million to support the financing needs of the low-income segments,” Ms Kamil added.\nThe Deputy Governor SBP further added that the share of women borrowers currently is just 20% and urged the MFIs to introduce gender inclusive policies. She especially commended the efforts of the Citi Foundation and PPAF for strengthening the micro-finance sector in Pakistan through these years.\nAhmed Bozai, Citi Country Officer & Managing Director, Pakistan while addressing the ceremony said, “These aspiring individuals are a living testament of how hard work, perseverance, and determination can spell success, despite very little capital and resources.\nCiti and the Citi Foundation are committed to support the budding entrepreneurs of the country and is proud to be associated with them.”\nHe congratulated PPAF for successfully implementing the CMA programme in Pakistan for the last 14 years. He said, “This collaboration has laid the foundation of a flourishing micro-finance industry where new micro-finance networks have been created and more people are now accessing micro-loans for generating income and achieving self-sufficiency.”\nSpeaking on the occasion, Mr. Nadir Gul, Chief Operating Officer (COO), PPAF said, “It is an excellent programme, and we laud the Citi Foundation’s commitment in organising these awards year after year.\nThis programme honors extraordinary micro-entrepreneurs across Pakistan who, with their small enterprises, have transformed micro-credit loans into life changing opportunities for their families and communities.”\nPPAF and its partners have provided 8.4 million micro-credit loans over the years to support the economic empowerment of under-served rural communities.\nSince its inception, the Citi Micro-entrepreneurship Award (CMA) has recognised over 500 outstanding micro-entrepreneurs in Pakistan. The objective of the programme is to highlight extraordinary micro-entrepreneurs who have taken small loans and built businesses that sustain them economically and allow them to contribute to their communities by providing employment.\nThe Citi Micro-entrepreneurship Awards programme serves as an important milestone in showcasing Pakistan’s real success stories to a global audience as well as helps bolster Pakistan’s image internationally.\nFor the 14th CMA, a total of 216 nominations were received from various MFIs operating across Pakistan, out of which micro-entrepreneurs satisfying the criteria of 100% repayment rate, measurable results in terms of employment generation, sales turnover, growth in enterprise profits, and rate of reinvestment of enterprise profits were shortlisted by a third party.\nThis short list was then submitted to an independent jury consisting of prominent individuals from the academia, private sector and from the international development community who met with all the candidates to elect the winners and the runners-up.\nThe award winners also benefited a short training on marketing and financial management to help them enhance their enterprises.\nThe CMA programme, launched in 2005, is a global initiative that showcases micro-finance as a potent tool for poverty alleviation, and micro-entrepreneurs as responsible, accountable, and credit-worthy bank clients.\nThe ceremony held in Islamabad was a successful culmination of more than a decade-long partnership between the Citi Foundation and PPAF, with an aim to inspire similar initiatives to come forward and support the aspiring micro-entrepreneurs and further strengthen the micro-finance industry of Pakistan.\nAbout Citi Foundation:The Citi Foundation works to promote economic progress and improve the lives of people in low-income communities around the world.
