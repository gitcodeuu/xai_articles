Likewise, policies related to energy mix and efficient energy supplies. Furthermore, there is also need of stable legislative and political culture.\nAs a result of these, it is expected that potential output growth will be upgraded, resulting in higher employment and real income growth.\nIt will also create additional capacity for exports and import substitution and a stable exchange rate environment. Thus, demand management fiscal and monetary policies should on average be neutral and play their role of cyclical stabilizers when temporary shocks create deviations from the long-term growth path.\nElaborating on details of economic performance, the survey said, the agriculture sector posted growth of 4.4 percent mainly due to 6.6 percent growth in Crops and 3.3 percent growth in Livestock. The growth in crops was recorded on account of 7.2 percent growth in Important Crops, 5.4 percent growth in Other Crops, and 9.2 percent growth in Cotton Ginning.\nIndustrial sector recorded a growth of 7.2 percent in FY2022 compared to 7.8 percent growth in FY2021.\nIndustrial sector performance is more dependent on the Manufacturing sector which has a share of 65.0 percent in the industry. Within Manufacturing, Large-Scale Manufacturing (LSM) holds 74 percent while its share in the industry is 48 percent.\nHowever, LSM is reflected by Quantum Index Numbers (QIM) data. During July – March FY2022, the QIM index posted a growth of 10.4 percent and major contributors to this growth remained Food (11.7%), Tobacco (16.7%), Textile (3.2%), Wearing Apparel (34.0%), Wood Products (157.5%), Chemicals (7.8%), Iron & Steel Products (16.5%), Automobiles (54.1%), Furniture (301.8%) and other manufacturing (37.8%).\nLikewise, services sector still constitutes the largest share of 58 percent in GDP even in the new methodology used for the Change of Base of National Accounts on 2015- 16. However, in the new methodology, the services sector has been divided into Ten subsectors.\nOn the other hand, the investment to GDP ratio is stuck between 14 to 15 percent, thus placing it 133 among 151 countries for year 20211. Even in Bangladesh, the investment to GDP ratio is 30.5 percent\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
