We are honored to celebrate her Birthday, her Platinum Jubilee, and 75 years of deep UK-Pakistan relations.”\nShe worked hard for “the promotion of the peace, the encouragement of education and culture, and establishing tolerant society,” High Commissioner added.\nHe said around 54% of Pakistan’s 220 million people are under 24 years old.\n“We need to ensure we support their dreams and aspirations, adding that last year alone, the British High Commission granted 10,000 student visas to the young Pakistani generation”.\nThe High Commissioner said Pakistan and the UK have a shared history, and both countries are marking 75 years of the UK and Pakistan relationship.\nHe also underlined Pakistan and the UK’s 75-year partnership – our people-to-people links, a 1.6 million Pakistani diaspora in the UK, 500,000 approximate annual visits in both directions, and around 100,000 British nationals in Pakistan\nThe UK wants to work with Pakistan, support a robust local economy, doubling trade by 2025, and the UK is already the third-largest trading partner of Pakistan, he added.\nHe further stated that last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Pakistan Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on the phone and welcomed the United Kingdom and Pakistan’s strong partnership over the past 75 years.\nThey agreed to strengthen those ties further and boost trade and investment.\nIt is pertinent to mention here that it was the first in a series of the Queen’s Platinum Jubilee week, which will also see birthday events in Karachi and Lahore – the latter closing with a performance from Qawwali singer Rahat Fateh Ali Khan.\nThe events across the world have been marking Her Majesty’s Platinum Jubilee and her 70 years of service to the people of the UK, the Realms, and the Commonwealth.
