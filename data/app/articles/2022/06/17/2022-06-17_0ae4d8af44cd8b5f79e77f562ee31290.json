The visas issued from New Delhi were in addition to the visas granted to Sikh pilgrims participating in these events from other countries.\nThe issuance of pilgrimage visas to religious pilgrims by the High Commission was in line with the Government of Pakistan’s commitment to fully implement the Bilateral Protocol on visits to Religious Shrines between the two countries.\nExpressing his views on the auspicious occasion, Charge d’Affaires Aftab Hasan Khan, extended his heartfelt felicitations to the pilgrims and wished them a rewarding and fulfilling yatra. Pakistan took immense pride in preserving sacred religious places and providing necessary facilitation to the visiting pilgrims, he added.\nDuring the visit, the pilgrims would, inter alia, go to Panja Sahib, Nankana Sahib and Kartarpur Sahib.
