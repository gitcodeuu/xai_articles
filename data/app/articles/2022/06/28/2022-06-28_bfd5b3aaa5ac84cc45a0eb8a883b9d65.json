He told the Authority to take notice of the matter and revert to the committee afterwards.\nThe Chairman Committee hinted at scores of illegal installations of Gas stations on the N-25 highway project approaching Karachi. The Chairman while calling for ensuring safety measures along the highway, underscored that these gas stations sometimes are becoming the cause of certain damages and quoted the examples of Commissioner Turbat and Parliamentarian Zehri.\nHe said that pulling them out is not the way forward but varied safety and security measures need to be taken.
