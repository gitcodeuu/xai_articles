The Chairman Senate said that he would follow the suspension issue even in the ECP if the protesting lawmakers did not mend their ways.\nLeader of the House Azam Nazeer Tarar said that it was agreed before the proceedings to listen the suggestions from the opposition as per parliamentary traditions but the opposition differently reacted in the House.\nHe said that lawmakers on the government benches were sitting silent and protest was being made by those who did not have strength to complete quorum and run the proceedings of the House.",
