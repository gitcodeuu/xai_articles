  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 30 (APP): Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) had witnessed the killing of 191 people and 72 military operations during January to June 2022, said a bi-annual human rights review report issued by Legal Forum for Kashmir.\nThe report said that Indian forces had destroyed 116 residential houses and conducted 120 Cordon and Search Operations (CASOs) in IIOJK.\nThe Indian forces had killed 122 freedom fighters striving for the freedom of the disputed territory.\nIt further adds that 24 civilians were also killed in various incidents of violence.\nThe intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders, journalists, and civil society continue at the hands of the Indian administration, the report added.\nThe bi-annual human rights review report has been prepared by FK on the situation of human rights in Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and covers the period from January to June 2022.\nThe ongoing war of liberation in IIOJK is witnessing a plethora of changes in terms of the ‘level of intensity.’\nIn last three years 1237 civilian properties were damaged by the Indian armed forces.\nThe densely militarized zone witnessed additional deployment of 15,000 armed forces personnel.\nThe new trend of ‘counter insurgency’ methods inflicting physical and mental harm to Kashmiris is increasing.\nThe report said few days before Indian occupying authorities attached five residential houses in Srinagar capital city of IIOJK under UAPA act.\nOne of the house owner said their properties were attached without serving any prior notice or giving them the opportunity to respond to the allegation of harboring any freedom fighter.\nSimilarly Indian occupying authorities had dismissed/ suspended the government employees, professors and other professional from the employment for alleged links with war of liberation movement.\nSince 2019, the Indian government has been accused of restricting critical journalism in Kashmir, with over 35 journalists imprisoned or questioned by authorities.\nAccording to official police data reviewed 2300 Kashmiris were booked under UAPA since August 5, 2019.\nKashmiri rights activist Khurram Parvez, chairman of the Asian Federation against Involuntary Disappearances (AFAD) and coordinator of the Jammu and Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society (JKCSS), has been incarcerated since November 2021, under farcical charges of “criminal conspiracy and waging war against the government.”\nThe report further said similarly Indian Judiciary has sentenced JKLF Chairman Mr Yasin Malik for the life imprisonment for advocating right to self-determination.\nIn first six months of 2022, there were several cases of Kashmiri students, laborers, traders, and drivers, being threatened, beaten, assaulted and intimidated in the mainland India.\nIn May, in a violent attack on Kashmiri students, at least 5 students were beaten and assaulted by Hindutva activists in the Swami Vivekanada University, Mohali Punjab.\nIn the continuum of illegal steps taken by India’s Occupying regime in (IIOJK), the government which is being led by BJP leader Narendra Modi since 2014 has executed fresh delimitation of constituencies.\nThe Jammu and Kashmir Delimitation Commission headed by former Justice Ranjana Prakash Desai of the Supreme Court of India, formed in 2021 for the fresh delimitation of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir as per the Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Act 2019 issued its final order on May 5, earmarking 43 seats to the Hindu-majority Jammu region and 47 to Muslim-majority Kashmir – making up a total of 90 seats for the Union territory’s assembly, up by 7 seats from the current strength of 83.\nThe arbitrary internet shutdowns and restrictions are clearly a form of systemic discrimination and a violation of the rights of Kashmiris. India Occupied Jammu & Kashmir accounts for two-thirds (403) of the total 655 internet shutdowns that India has seen since 2012.\nThe IIOJK saw 94 instances of internet outages from January 1, to June 30, this year, it concluded.",
