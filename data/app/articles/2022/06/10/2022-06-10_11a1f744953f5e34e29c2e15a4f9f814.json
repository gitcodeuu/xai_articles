He expressed the hope that the agreement will open new vistas for the students and teachers of the UAJK by providing them with new opportunities in the field of higher education and research.\nThe USAK University, he went on to say, had also offered fellowships to the UAJK students who could join USAK University in the final semester for practical training.\nHe particularly thanked the Turkish government and the people of Turkey for their generous support to the people of Azad Kashmir after the catastrophic earthquake of 2005 and said that the great humanitarian spirit and Islamic brotherhood demonstrated by the Turkish government and people will never be forgotten.\n“The building of City Campus of UAJK in Muzaffarabad would remain an emblem of the friendship and brotherhood between the people of Turkey and Azad Kashmir,” the vice chancellor remarked.\nDr Abbasi said that the Turkish government was gradually opening the doors to higher education for the students of Azad Kashmir as 32 students from AJK were currently pursuing PhD and undergraduate studies at various Turkish universities and this number will grow further. Time is not far off when a sustainable educational corridor will be established between the people of the two regions, he added.\nPrior to the signing of the MoU, Director ORIC Dr. Muhammad Naeem Ahmed introduced the UAJK, its history, and educational programmes to President of Palestine University Dr. Amjad Baraham and presented him souvenirs.",
