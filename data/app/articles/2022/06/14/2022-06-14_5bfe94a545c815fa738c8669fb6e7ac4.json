He said that ongoing budget session is very important and opposition benches can be convinced for not pointing out the quorum.\nSpeaker Raja Pervaiz Ashraf endorsed the views of Riaz Hussain Pirzada and Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah and ensured implementation on it.\nMeanwhile, MQM legislator Engr. Sabir Hussain Kaim Khani said that session of the House should start in time as the legislators sit in lobbies and their presence in the House soon after the outset is not an issue.\nMNA Noor Alam Khan said that opposition would not point out the quorum but Minister for Finance should be present during the debate on budget.
