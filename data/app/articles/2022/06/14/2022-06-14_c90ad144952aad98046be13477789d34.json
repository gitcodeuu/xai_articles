  "content": "SKARDU, Jun 14 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi Wednesday said that the provision of quality education to the children was inevitable for the progress and prosperity of Gilgit Baltistan.\nThe president, addressing a ceremony for distributing transportation stipends among the students of government schools at Skardu Girls High School of Quaidabad here, also called for removing the impediments in the course of education.\nHe also emphasized the steps to provide the required resources for the promotion of education.\nHe appreciated the Government of Gilgit Baltistan for launching a “revolutionary project” to address the difficulties faced by the students, particularly the girls, in their traveling to the schools.\nHe said the project would help reduce the ratio of out-of-school children, and increase the literacy rate, particularly female literacy.\nHe said as education was a fundamental right of every child, the state was responsible to ensure the provision of education to children aged five to 16 years.\nThe president observed that the students, particularly the females, had to face difficulties to reach their schools, and the GB government’s step to provide stipends for persuading the parents to send children to schools was laudable.\nHe said right decision-making was inevitable in practical life which was not possible to achieve without education.\nHe hoped that the GB government would ensure education for every child within the next few years. Moreover, the character-building of the students should also be focused upon in the schools, he added.",
