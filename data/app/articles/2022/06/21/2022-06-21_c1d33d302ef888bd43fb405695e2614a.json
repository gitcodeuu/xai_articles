  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 21 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi on Tuesday directed the Pakistan Post Office Department to refund the pension amount of Rs 502,272 that was wrongly deducted from the service dues of a retired employee in March 2020.\nThe president termed the act of Pakistan Post as “maladministration” on its part.\nThe president gave these directions while rejecting a representation of the Pakistan Post Office Department against a decision of the Wafaqi Mohtasib ordering the Agency to refund the deducted amount from the pension dues and report compliance within 45 days.\nThe president in his decision held that the pensioner’s hard-earned income constitutes a fundamental right to livelihood under Article 9 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973 and depriving him even a part of this amount, cannot be countenanced except in accordance with the law.\nHe observed that the Pensions Act 1871 envisaged that no pension shall be liable to seizure, attachment or sequestration, and the department had unjustifiably recovered an amount of Rs.502,272/- from the complainant.\nAs per details, the complainant approached the Wafaqi Mohtasib claiming that the amount of Rs.502,272 had been unjustly deducted by the Agency from his service dues.\nThe Mohtasib in its decision announced on April 2021 referred the case back to Pakistan Post Office Department to provide relief to the complainant within 45 days.\nInstead of implementing the decision, the Pakistan Post Office Department filed a representation with the President against the decision of the Mohtasib.\nThe president in his order upheld the decision of the Wafaqi Mohtasib and directed the Pakistan Post to refund the amount along with the applicable bank interest rate within 30 days of the order.",
