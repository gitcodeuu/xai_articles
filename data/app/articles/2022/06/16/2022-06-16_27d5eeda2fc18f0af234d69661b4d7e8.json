He said that the European Parliament should also organize an Intra-Kashmir Dialogue and play its role in initiating dialogue between India and Pakistan.\nHe said that the dire situation in the Indian occupied Kashmir also merits urgent attention of the EU.  He also sought the EU parliamentarians’ role in establishing Friends of Kashmir group in the European Parliament to galvanize support for the resolution of Kashmir issue and stop the ongoing human rights violations in Occupied Kashmir.\nThe European Union and the European Parliament, he said, should also play their due role in the early release of Yassin Malik.  He should play his important role in preventing violation of rights and giving Kashmiri people their right to self-determination.",
