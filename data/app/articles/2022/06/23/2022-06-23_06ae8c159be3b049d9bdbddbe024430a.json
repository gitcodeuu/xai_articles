  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 23 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi Thursday advised the students to develop critical and analytical thinking skills to overcome biases inherent in human nature to achieve the ability of judicious decision-making.\nThe president, talking to the students of Cadet College, Murree here at the Aiwan-e-Sadr, said the youth needed to be trained to sift through the mass of information and discern misinformation and fake news from accurate information for making intelligent and informed judgments.\nThe president advised the students to keep the doors of knowledge open throughout their lives and learn from past experiences as well as utilise the knowledge and information made readily available to them by information technology.\nHe also urged the students to draw inspiration from the life and conduct of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) as well as learn lessons from the lives of successful persons.\nThis, he said, would enrich them intellectually and socially besides making them a better and more useful person for the benefit of society and the country.\nPresident Alvi said that Quaid-e-Azam used to hold students in great esteem and encouraged them to actively participate in Pakistan’s Freedom Movement to carve a separate homeland for the Muslims of India.\nReplying to a question, Arif Alvi said that as the President of Pakistan, he had been working for safeguarding women’s property rights, the welfare and education of differently-abled persons, and promoting the use of Information Technology in all sectors of national importance.\nHe said that Pakistan needed to increase the number of skilled IT human resources to fill the ever-widening gap between demand and supply of IT professionals in the country and around the world.\nHe said that human resources in addition to natural resources were the essential ingredients for nations to make sustained and fast-track development.\nHe said that in the absence of skilled human resources, the natural resources remained untapped and unexploited, thus, hampering a country’s progress.\nPresident Alvi emphasized that the educational institutions should be fully geared to multiply their capacity to produce highly skilled human resources by adopting online and hybrid methods of imparting knowledge and skills to their students. This would ensure a steady supply of skilled professionals capable of effectively utilizing our unexploited natural resources.",
