We intend to work on the development of track for Thar coal on priority, he added.\nThe Federal Railways Minister said that the encroachers on the KCR track should not have been removed by force, instead, they should be given compensation.\nHe said that the expertise to develop roads and highways were available in the country but there was a lack in terms of development of train tracks along with necessary facilities.\nTo a question, he said that the land of railways had been digitized and now the land owned by the Pakistan Railways could be identified easily.\nSaad Rafique said that operating railways as a profitable service throughout the world was a tough task as it was also like a public transport.\nHe categorically stated that all out efforts would be made to bring the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CEPC) back on track.\nTo another question, he said that they have only limited time of around 12 months and during this short period they would strive hard to set the right direction for Pakistan Railways.\nThe minister claimed that the policy to convert the economy class into air-tight air-conditioned class would also be pursued.\nAnswering to a question about the condition of Rohri raily station, he termed it a very important location and said that the station would be developed on priority basis. Later, another station will also be developed in the interior Sindh, and then development of stations in Karachi would be planned, he added.\nThe railways minister said that no compromise would be made on provision of safe and healthy food and cleaning facilities in the trains.\nHe told the media persons that curtains would be hanged in the economy class and liquid soap would be provided in the toilets.",
