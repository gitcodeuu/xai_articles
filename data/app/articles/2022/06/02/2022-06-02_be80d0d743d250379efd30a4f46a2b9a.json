  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jun 2 (APP): PML-N Vice President Maryam Nawaz Thursday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) would go burst and face abrupt disintegration, expressing the optimism that Pakistan  would stay fully safe and sound, due to current leadership of the country.\nLambasting the statement of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman Imran Khan about strategic assets and disintegration of the country, she said the the country would stay integrated forever that came into being, after great sacrifices by Muslims of the Sub-continent.\nAddressing news conference, she said: “It is a condemnable statement of Imran Khan that Pakistan, will be divided into three parts,” and questioned on whose agenda he was\nup to.\nShe said the statement was tantamount to disgracing the sacrifices rendered by Muslims for an independent state, Pakistan. With the Grace of Allah Almighty no damage could be done to Pakistan as the country was in safe hands.\nNot Pakistan, rather it was the PTI which would eventually be disintegrated into three hundred pieces.\nShe said political parties including Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), Pakistan People’s Party and Pakistan Awami Party did face hardships but they always raised the slogan of “Pakistan Zindabad and Pakistan Khappay”.\nMaryam Nawaz said former Prime Minister Imran Khan had lust for power and had now resorted to dirty politics to get in the government again.\nThe PML-N leader said it was hallmark of mainstream politicians that they always worked for the greater national unity, not for the division.\nShe also berated Imran Khan for negative remarks about the rollback of strategic programme of the country. She said Imran Khan in a previous interview with foreign media outlet had said that Pakistan did not need the strategic capability.\nThe PML-N Vice President said Imran Khan had been issuing such statements since his party contributed nothing in making Pakistan a nuclear power.\nMaryam Nawaz also criticized Imran Khan for not duly recognizing services of Armed Forces and said security departments were performing their duties in line with the Constitution.\nShe said the PTI chairman was desperate to regain the powers despite the fact that his mandate in 2018-election was bogus, adding Imran Khan betrayed everyone whosoever reposed confidence in him.\nShe said the past regime of PTI, under Imran Khan, had ruined the national economy with his sheer incompetence and flawed policies.\nShe called upon citizens, regardless of political affiliation, to play their due part to steer the country out of the present crisis, and asked students, young generation, opinion makers and analysts to stand with Pakistan.\n“You are not required to support PML-N or the government but need to stand with Pakistan,” she added.\nThe previous PTI government, she said, did nothing for the welfare of the common people, except resorting to political victimization and misuse of official resources for political gains.\nShe said that Imran Khan was the root cause of all the problems presently the country was faced with.\nTo a question, Maryam Nawaz said some lawmakers of the PTI had no intention to resign from the the National Assembly and asked them to distance themselves from Imran Khan’s wrong policies and faulty politics.",
