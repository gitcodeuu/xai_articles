It had now become the cornerstone of Pakistan’s foreign policy, as Bilawal Bhutto soon after taking oath as the youngest Foreign Minister of Pakistan, had his first official bilateral visit to China, he added.\nThe Pak-China friendship – higher than the Himalayas – would continue to play its role for regional development especially by executing all projects of CPEC.\nWhile mentioning the magnanimity of CPEC for the socio-economic development of the region, he said it had always been supported with full vigor by all successive governments in Pakistan.\nHe said Gwadar was the most important pillar of the CPEC project, and its development had transformed and connected the whole region.\nGwadar, he added, had now become the hub of trade and connectivity due to China’s earnest policy for its development. Hydropower projects under CPEC would lessen the energy crisis in Pakistan, he said.\nThe NA speaker said it was the need of hour to dispel the misinformation and disinformation, which was being propagated against CPEC projects in Pakistan.\nHe said the parliamentary ownership was pivotal to carrying out CPEC projects. The Parliamentary Committee on CPEC was overseeing their fast completion, and it would continue to provide parliamentary ownership to CPEC, he added.\nActing Chinese ambassador in Pakistan also talked about the importance of CPEC to take the Pak-China friendship to new heights of cooperation and welfare for the people of both countries.\nShe said it was the media of both countries that could ensure and propagate the benefits reaped due to the completion of CPEC different projects.\nSenator Musahid Hussain especially appreciated the Speaker’s participation in the event. He also talked about CPEC as being a catalyst for regional development.",
