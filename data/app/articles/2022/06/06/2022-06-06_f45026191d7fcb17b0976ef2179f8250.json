The world and human rights organizations should take note of this desecration of religious believes”, Sherry Rehman said.\nShe added that the standard of global tolerance could not be different for other countries and for India Prime Minister Modi.\nShe underlined that the Indian extremism had become a threat to the world. “It is not enough just to suspend the membership of BJP leaders.
