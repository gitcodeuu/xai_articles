The film particularly focused on the biographies of three truck drivers that highlighted their struggles to earn bread and butter for their families when almost everything was blocked.\nThe direction was done by Faizan Shoro, whereas Vishal Kodwani was the producer and director of the camera and the voice-over was done by Syed Akbar Ali.\nVishal told APP that he was very happy when he came to know that his film had qualified for the contest and helped him secure a foreign scholarship. The NYFA diploma, he added, would help to explore new technology and ideas of filmmaking, as the Academy is one of the best places to learn filming.\n“I want to pay special gratitude to Ministry of Information and ISPR who conducted this competition and gave us this scintillating opportunity. Thank you Pakistan”, he expressed.\nMinistry of Information and Broadcasting in collaboration with Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) had sought online registration for the National Amateur Short Film Festival (NASFF) themed “the colours of Pakistan, the Indus identity, Pakistan a cultural melting pot, empowerment through SMEs, Philanthropy in Pakistan and Value addition in Agri-products of Pakistan”.\nNASFF was created to tap the talent and creativity of Pakistani youth, who choose Film and TV production and mass media communication as their professional careers. The festival was meant to proffer a chance to such talented youth to produce high quality short films projecting the real image of Pakistan.",
