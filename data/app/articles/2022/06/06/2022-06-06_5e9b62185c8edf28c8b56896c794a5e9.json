In addition, the  coal was being imported to further reduce the loadshedding.\n“From June 16, the loadshedding would be significantly reduced,” he maintained.\nThe former PM also expressed the hope that the government would be able to reduce this further during the month of July.\n“The government was not interested in making excuses and was focused on fixing the issues the country is suffering from,” he added.\nHe lashed out at the former government for the lies regarding establishing power plants, saying that Pakistan was unable to fulfill its electricity demand for the summer.\nCriticizing the previous tenure of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Abbasi said that the efficiency of some power plants in the country was extremely low and should had been replaced.\nSome power plants produce electricity at Rs 60 per unit, he said, and added that not a single megawatt of energy was inducted into the national grid during the PTI government.\nHe  further said that the government was not receiving any tax on petrol and it was being sold at the purchasing rate.\nWhile discussing about the removal of fuel subsidy, the PML(N) leader said that no country in the world could sustain itself by providing subsidies.\nHe also ensured that the prices of petrol to be slashed once the rate of oil in international markets was reduced.\nAnswering a question on a statement by the PTI member of National Assembly, that he would commit a suicide attack if anything happened to the PTI chief Imran Khan, Abbasi said the PTI had already committed suicide attack on this country.\nThe way PTI broke the IMF agreement was an example (virtual suicide attack) as it created many hurdles for the new government, he added.\nHe said that the LNG contracts made during the previous tenure of the PML-N government were saving Rs140 billion for the country’s national exchquer.",
