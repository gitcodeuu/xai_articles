An impression created that the matter was deliberately being kept in pending,” CEC observed and directed the counsel to inform the ECP by Thursday that how much time was required for completion of arguments.\nEarlier, PTI’s financial expert Najam Shah told the commission that the scrutiny committee has made an overstatement of 59.7 million in funds.\nShah said according to scrutiny committee’s 2012-13 report, PTI had received over Rs 1.19 billion funds. While the State Bank pointed out 19 bank accounts of the PTI. The party had eight central audited accounts in 2012-13.\n“Do you want to say that the committee was not authorized to write to the state bank,” ECP member Nisar Durrani asked. Answer Mansoor replied that the scrutiny committee had written letter to State Bank by exercising its authority.\nThe PTI was not aware about the accounts, added by the central bank in the party’s record, lawyer said.\nPTI’s central finance wing was also unaware about the opening of accounts by the individuals, Anwer Mansoor said adding that the collected amounts were not included in PTI’s audit (report). In the audit report there were details of the accounts of the PTI’s central finance wing, he added.\nLater, talking to media founder member of PTI, the petitioner Akbar S Babar said PTI had again sought more time as former ruling party wanted to further drag the case.\nHe said PTI counsel argued that the party was unaware of the opening of the accounts.\nWho sent the money in those accounts and what punishment was awarded to them.\nHe said Imran Khan was hiding in Peshawar after announcing Jihad. Imran wanted to use pakhtuns to serve his ulterior motives.",
