As a result, 65 Broadband Service and OFC projects were launched from 2019 to date, which is a record,” he added.\nSyed Amin-Ul-Haque said as a result of telecom policies and provision of broadband services to un-served and under-served areas, the number of telecom subscribers had reached a record level of 193 million by May 30, 2022. Similarly, the number of 3G and 4G subscribers in the country had crossed 114 million while the number of those using broadband services reached 117 million.\n“It is necessary to relax strict conditions, including tax enforcement, and give maximum relaxation to the IT industry and freelancers, otherwise, it is feared that if IT companies and freelancers were not given facilities, including tax incentives, the industry will shut down soon,” the minister observed.\nThe meeting was attended by Secretary IT Mohsin Mushtaq, additional secretary finance, member telecom and other officials.",
