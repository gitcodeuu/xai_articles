At present, water level in Mangla Dam is 1191.80 feet against its MCL: 1242 feet (47.85 % storage still left). Chashma\nReservoir is also being maintained at 648.60 feet (against MCL: 649.00 feet) since 2 nd September 2022.\nThe combined live storage of Tarbela, Chashma & Mangla Reservoirs is 9.921 MAF (i.e. 73.70 % of 13.461 MAF).\nYesterday’s trough of Westerly Wave over Northern parts of Afghanistan lies over Northeastern Afghanistan. Weak seasonal low lies over Northwestern Balochistan.\nAt present, weak moist currents from Bay of Bengal are penetrating upper parts of Pakistan up to 4000 feet.\nFFD, Lahore, has predicated scattered thunderstorm/rain of moderate intensity over Islamabad, Punjab (Rawalpindi & Gujranwala Divisions), Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Peshawar Division) including upper catchments of all the Major Rivers of Indus River system.\nIsolated thunderstorm/rain of light to moderate intensity is also expected over Punjab (Sargodha, Lahore, Faisalabad, Sahiwal, Multan, DG Khan & Bahawalpur Divisions), Southeastern Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Kohat, Bannu & D.I.
