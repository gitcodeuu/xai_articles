He received his primary education in the city and went abroad for higher studies. Jinnah served as leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until Pakistan’s creation on August 14, 1947. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder the leadership of Quaid-e-Azam, Muslims struggled for a separate country. He then served as Pakistan’s first Governor-General until his death on September 11, 1948.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t   .\nTo mark the day, various programmes have also been planned by educational institutions and political, social and cultural organisations to shed light on the personality and leadership of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah.\nQuran Khwani and Fateha Khwani would be held at the Mazar-e-Quaid in Karachi.
