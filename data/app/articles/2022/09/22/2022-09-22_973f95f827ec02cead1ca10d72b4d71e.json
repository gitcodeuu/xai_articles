The Committee also directed for holding the National Medical and Dental College Admission Test (MDCAT) tests on single day throughout the country.\nThe Committee was apprised that the pharmaceutical sector had demanded for increase in price of paracetamol, however its request had not been acceded to by the federal cabinet.\nThe Chief Executive Officer DRAP apprised that punitive action had been initiated against the concerned.\nThe Special Secretary of the Ministry apprised that the provision of medicines specially in the flood effected areas was being ensured. He told that the government had already received sufficient supply of paracetamol by the foreign governments.\nThe Committee also expressed its annoyance over consecutive absence of Federal Minister and Secretary from attending the Committee’s meetings.\nThe Committee decided to discuss The Pakistan Nursing Council (Emergency Management), Bill, 2022 (Ordinance XXIX of 2021) (Government Bill) and The ICT Tuberculosis (Notification) Bill, 2022, moved by Ms. Uzma Riaz, MNA, in its next meeting.\nThe Committee decided to further discuss issues related to DRAP in presence of the minister.\nThe Committee expressed its disappointment on the performance of Pakistan Nursing Council (PNC) terming it a failure to bring the nursing sector at par with the international standards.\nThe Committee was of the view that substandard clinical training, obsolete curriculum and lack of quality training institutions were the main reasons.\nThe Committee directed the ministry to further ponder upon the a legislative proposal in that regard and address all the issues pointed out by the committee. The Committee also suggested that the amendments should not defeat the spirit of a regulator. The committee also said that proliferation of private institution and lack of monitoring by PNC had deteriorated the standard of trained human resource. It also asked for a comprehensive briefing on syllabus of all programs and fee structure for all these programs besides monitoring system of PNC.\nThe Registrar PNC apprised the committee about the performance of the nursing regulator. She informed that 60 percent out of 339 institutes imparting training in the sector were private institutes. She said that 17,485 nurses and paramedics have been enrolled with PNC till date.\nThe Special Secretary informed that the PNC had been subjected to infighting between its ranks which had resulted in production of substandard human resource. He said that nursing and paramedics sector had huge potential in local as well as in foreign countries and if standardized human resource as per international standards were produced, it could earn substantial foreign exchange for the country.\nLater, the Committee was briefed by the Chief Executive, Islamabad Healthcare Regulatory Authority (IHRA) that IHRA had been mandated to regulate healthcare sector within the jurisdiction of Islamabad Capital Territory. He informed that the Authority was keeping vigilant check on provision of best healthcare facilities in private as well as public sector facilities.
