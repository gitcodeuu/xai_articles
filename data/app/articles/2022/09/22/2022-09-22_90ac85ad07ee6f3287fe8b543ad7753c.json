Pakistan steadfastly supports the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to self-determination,” he remarked.\nThe spokesperson said that the establishment of an independent, viable and contiguous Palestinian State with pre-1967 borders and Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital, in accordance with the relevant UN and OIC resolutions, was imperative for just and lasting peace in the region.",
