  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 22 (APP): Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar on Thursday rejected the criticism on Transgender bill and negated the misconception that the law was repugnant to Islamic injunctions.\nAddressing a press conference alongside Adviser to PM for Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan Qamar Zaman Kaira, Tarar clarified that the bill was passed by the Senate and National Assembly in the presence of religious and political leaders.\nHe said that after reaching the age of 18 years, transgender persons could declare their genders on their identity cards.\nHe said that the Transgender Act was passed in 2018 while Jamaat-e-Islami Senator Mushtaq Ahmed brought amendments in parliament to prevent misuse of this law and the government supported these amendments.\nThe entire process of the Transgender Law included the opinion of the Council of Islamic Ideology, he added.\nHe said that the government would accept the decision of the Shariah court regarding this matter and the guidance of the Shariah court was also needed regarding the medical of the transgender. The rights of the transgender had been protected by this law, he added.\nThe Minister said that there was always a chance of weakness or misuse of it whenever a law was passed. He said that complaints started coming after two years on a provision that there was a possibility that sections 3 and 4 could be misused.\nHe said that according to the aforementioned sections, after reaching the age of 18 years, transgender persons could declare their genders on their identity cards.\nHe said that it should be suitably amended and made subject to the decision of the Medical Board. This matter was still under consideration in the Parliament and two petitions were filed in the Federal Sharia Court. But if the amendment was necessary, it should be done through the Parliament, he added.\nHe said that there were also two provisions regarding recognition and identity. But, the matter would only be changed after the verdict of the shariah court, he added.\nHe said that the prime responsibility of the shariah court was to see whether a law was against the shariah and the principles of Islam. The government had submitted its responses on the pleas as well, he added.\nHe said that some friends twisted this matter and claimed that the law was encouraging homosexuality. It was also being perceived that entire law was completely negative, he added.\nTarar said that the law talked about discrimination, sexual harassment, the right to inheritance, the right to education, the right to health, and the right to employment for transgender persons.\nHe said that the reason for interacting with media today was that this was not about those arguments, this was about Constitution, law, shariah and human rights.\nHe requested media to spread this message further. “I expect the Pakistani people to understand that transgender persons were Pakistanis, they were a part of the society.\nHe said that the provisions of the law, starting off with the definition of a transgender person and contending that the law nowhere stated that any person could be a transgender themselves.\nHe said that the Ministry of Human Rights was working on the rights of transgenders, establishment of separate cells in prisons and other issues.\nHe said that the powers of the federal government were determined in the constitution. The issue of relieving an officer was going on, the appointment and deployment of a federal officer was the authority of the federal government and if there was a provincial officer, the federation could not ask for him, he added.",
