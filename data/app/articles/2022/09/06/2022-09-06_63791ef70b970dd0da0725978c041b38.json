We have not seen a humanitarian disaster of such epic proportions. More than 5,700 km of metaled roads and 246 bridges have been severely damaged in the 81 calamity-hit regions, cutting communication lines making relief and rescue herculean challenge.”\nApprising the Ambassador of the assistance needed in the flood-hit regions, the minister said, “We need to rebuild adaptive and resilient infrastructure. Moreover, we are now bracing for a health emergency due to the water-borne diseases such as cholera and dengue.\nHealth assistance is imperative due to fragility and vulnerability on ground as people are surviving under open skies, waiting for government assistance.\nWe need to provide tents and medics on priority basis. Women health crisis is looming in the heart of affected areas with at least 650,000 pregnant women, of whom 73,000 are expected to deliver next month. The flood-affected areas are in dire need of maternal health service.”\nGaley expressed condolences and deepest regret on the loss of lives due to the devastating floods and assured full support from the French government in these trying times.",
