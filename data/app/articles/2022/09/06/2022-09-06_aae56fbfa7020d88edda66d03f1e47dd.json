  "content": "SHEIKHUPURA, Sep 6 (APP): Federal Minister Mian Javed Latif on Tuesday said evidence of a conspiracy hatched by PTI Chairman Imran Khan against the country would be made public soon.\n“Imran Khan is a foreign agent and all the cases pending against him in courts should be decided immediately,” he said while addressing a Defence Day rally in Sheikhupura.\nThe minister alleged that the former prime minister was bent upon making the state institutions controversial as under the conspiracy he was continuously unleashing a “verbal onslaught” against them.\n“Imran Khan is behind the controversial statements of Shehbaz Gill and Shaukat Tarin, and at the same a question arises that who is pulling his (Imran’s) strings” the minister said.\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf chief could do anything for power, he added.\nJaved Latif said,”During his four-year misrule, Imran Khan sabotaged all the progress and development made by the previous Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz government under the leadership of Nawaz Sharif from 2013 to 2018.”\nHe said PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif had never spoken against the institutions “despite the ill-treatment meted out to him and his daughter Maryam Nawaz who were sent to jail”.\nBoth the father and the daughter stood firm in the face of challenges, but never resorted to inciting the people against the state institutions, he added.\nThe minister said Nawaz Sharif had brought heavy foreign investment in the form of mega projects like China Pakistan Economic Corridor, and made Pakistan a nuclear power. On the other hand, Imran Khan, who had even sold the Toshakhana gifts, wanted to create anarchy in the country, he added.\nHe paid glowing tribute to the Pakistan armed forces personnel, who had sacrificed their lives while defending the motherland during the 1965 War against India. “Those who have been sacrificing their lives for the country are our national heroes,” he remarked.",
