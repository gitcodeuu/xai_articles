Many parts of Asia Pacific will face the same damages in the coming years especially those not adapting to climate resilience.\nWe’re seeing a situation where all international platforms, including the UN, are perturbed.

The green economy can generate more than 2.4 million jobs by 2030.\nIn this regard, parliaments need to take a 3-prong approach; Legislative, Budgetary, and Oversight Actions towards sustainable development.\nMs. Sarah Wade-Apicella, Head of Partnerships and Stakeholder Engagement Unit, United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), gave recommendations for a risk-informed resilience pathway.\nShe said that investment in governance and institutional coordination, innovative financing mechanisms, resilient infrastructure investments, sustainable consumption and nature-based solutions can help greatly in a sustainable recovery.\nMr Saber H. Chaudhary, Honorary IPU President, MP from Bangladesh, said that we are living in terrible times of Climate Change and Disasters.\nHe said that Pakistan has just incurred a potential loss of 30 billion dollars.

Climate change is inflicting a loss of 9M lives globally every year. Pakistan is facing both hazardous air pollution and heat waves.\nQuality monitoring can help parliamentarians see the progress of their actions and share that Pakistan has signed and ratified all the agreements on climate change.",
