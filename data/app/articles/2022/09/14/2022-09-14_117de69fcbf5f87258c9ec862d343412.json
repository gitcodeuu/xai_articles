  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 14 (APP):Federal Minister Mian Javed Latif on Wednesday warned Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan of severe public reaction and wrath if he did not abandon his “systematic campaign” against state institutions.\nHe said there must not be multiple standards of accountability for different political parties, and Imran Khan should also be made accountable of his litany of baseless criticism against the institutions.\nAddressing a press conference, Javed Latif said, “Imran Khan used to say that he will not negotiate with us (PML-N & allies), and now he is offering talks under the compulsion of changed environment.”\nIn case the situation had not changed, he would have been harping on the old mantra even today, he added.\nImran Khan, he said, was now seeking NROs (National Reconciliation Ordinance) from the government, the institutions and even from the United States.\nThe minister called for the constitution of a parliamentary commission to formally probe Imran Khan’s objectives of his “systematic campaign against the institutions”.\nThe commission should also be tasked to scrutinise the shocking revelations of Javed Hashmi about the manipulation of results of last general election, disclosures of Justice (retd) Shaukat Siddiqui, and the video of late Judge Arshad Malik for sorting out the real motives of Imran Khan, he added.\nHe urged the Federal Shariat Court to take a suo moto notice of Imran Khan’s remarks, “which negate Islamic teachings”. He also urged the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) to summon Imran on the matter.\nHe accused Imran Khan of promoting secularism and creating chaos in the country.\nThe minister also played video clips of Imran Khan containing controversial remarks.\nTo a question, Javed Latif said the nation would accord a rousing welcome to former prime minister Muhammad Nawaz Sharif on his return from abroad.",
