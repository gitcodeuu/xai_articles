In 2016, INL was the sole funder for Phase One of the UN Women program, providing $3.5 million.\nGender inclusivity and women’s empowerment in law enforcement and criminal justice is a top priority for INL in Pakistan. INL supports programs to improve women’s access to justice through improved law enforcement response to gender-based violence. More and better trained women law enforcement professionals mean superior delivery of justice to Pakistani women.”\nDuring the life of the programme, TAHAFFUZ will strengthen capacity of law enforcement officials through improving knowledge and attitudes on gender, enhancing handling of cases of VAW along with improved coordination between security and justice sector stakeholders, forensic officers, and medical examiners.\nIn his keynote address, Federal Minister for Law and Justice Azam Nazeer Tarar highlighted the steps taken by the Government of Pakistan towards preventing and protecting women against violence.\nHe thanked INL and UN Women for extending their support, said, “Many progressive laws have been enacted in Pakistan and a strong legislative framework exists – we need to make sure it is implemented in letter and spirit so that the citizens of our country, especially the women, are able to benefit from it. This programme will help create a safe and enabling environment for women and girls so that they may play an active role in national progress and sustainable development.”\nChairperson National Commission on the Status of Women, Ms. Nilofar Bakhtiar, MNA and Parliamentary Secretary, MOLJ Ms Mehnaz Akbar Aziz also spoke at the National Launch Event.\nThis year marks the 40-year anniversary of partnership between INL and Pakistan under the banner of “Justice, Security, and Prosperity,” with more than $1 billion invested over four decades by the United States government to improve public safety and enhance law enforcement, prosecutorial, and judicial capacity across Pakistan.?\nINL works in more than 60 countries to help combat crime and corruption; improve police institutions; and promote court systems that are fair and accountable.
