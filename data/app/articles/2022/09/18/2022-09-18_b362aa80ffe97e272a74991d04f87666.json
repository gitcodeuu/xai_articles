  "content": "TORONTO, Sept 18 (APP): Thousands of Sikhs here on Sunday arrived at the polling station at the Gore Meadows Community Center in Brampton to cast their vote for a referendum on the creation of Khalistan – a new state in Indian Punjab.\nThe voting started with special prayers. A large number of women and the elderly were in the queue to vote in the referendum.\nThe voters said the results of the referendum would make it clear that Sikhs wanted freedom from India.\nA new country would appear on the map of the world in the state of Indian Punjab, they said adding India could not deprive Sikhs of freedom.\nThe Canadian government has refused to stop Canadian Sikhs from expressing their views by holding of Khalistan Referendum and by linking it with a peaceful and democratic process within the legal parameters of the Canadian laws.\nCommenting on the situation which emerged after an attack on a Hindu temple and the poster of a revered Khalistan Sikh leader, a Canadian government official said that the Canadian nationals had every freedom to express their views under the Canadian laws relating to the right to freedom of expression and right to free speech and assembly.\nThe official views came after lobbying by the Indian government urging the Canadian government to act against the rising pro-Khalistani sentiment in Canada, which is home to over one million Sikhs. A high-profile campaign for Khalistan is being run by the pro-Kahlistani and pro-separatist group Sikhs for Justice (SFJ).\nAccording to international media reports, the Indian government tried to apply diplomatic pressure on the Canadian government ahead of the Khalistan Referendum voting on 18 September at the Gore Meadows Community Center in Brampton, Ontario. Hundreds of Sikhs gathered at the center on Saturday to make preparations for the voting on Sunday.\nThe Canadian officials were quoted as saying that it could not take away right of the Canadians to engage in any kind of political activity and demand their rights through peaceful and democratic means.\nCanadian parliamentarian Sukhminder Singh Dhaliwal also said that constitutional and democratic political expression could not be stopped.\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun, the Counsel General of Sikhs for Justice and a New York Attorney said the Indian government used every trick to paint Sikhs in a bad light before the West but the democratic governments had refused to come under the Indian pressure.\nThey recognized that Khalistan Referendum sought to assess the desire for an independent Khalistan, he said, adding once the voting process was completed then the case would be taken up at the United Nations.\nGurpatwant Singh Pannun reiterated that SFJ and other pro-Khalistan organizations had no links with violence. “We are for ballot, not bullet. India hates our approach to peace,” he maintained.\nJatinder Singh Grewal, the policy director of SFJ, said: “The issue of Khalistan Referendum falls well within the right of freedom of expression, which is a fundamental right enjoyed by all Canadians.  India has a difficult time understanding this principle as they have systematically criminalized political decent within their state and today countless Sikhs who wish to exercise their right to self-determination are labeled as `terrorists.”\nAnd now India was trying to export this system to the west.  But the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom guaranteed this right and no amount of Indian pressure would change this reality, he added.\nAccording to media reports, Modi’s government felt perturbed at the scenes of thousands of Sikhs coming out in the western capitals demanding freedom from India and the establishment of an independent state of Khalisatn.\nThe issue of Sikh separatism was a major bone of contention of Prime Minister Trudeau’s trip to India a few years ago. The Indian government had openly accused the Canadian authorities of showing leniency towards Khalistanis in Canada.\nThe Indian government demanded of the Canadian government to prevent people from misusing their right to freedom of expression to “incite violence and glorify terrorists as martyrs” which was vehemently denied by SFJ.\nThe Indian media said that earlier this week, the Indian authorities launched a strong protest with the Canadian counterparts after BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in Toronto was vandalized with anti-Indian and pro-Khalistan slogans written at the entrance ahead of 18 September Khalistan Referendum voting which was set to attract tens of thousands of Sikhs.\nThe Indian government condemned the vandalism at the Mandir, calling on the Canadian prime minister to take action against the suspected Khalistani activists.\n“India had formally submitted a request in 2021 to the Canadian administration demanding a ban on SFJ. However, looking at the way this organisation is conducting a referendum event with no intervention by the Canadian authorities, it can be safely concluded that Indian demands have fallen on deaf ears. The recent defacing of a Swaminarayan temple proves that the Indian government must take up the matter with its Canadian counterpart,” a leading Indian media outlet, News18 said.\n“We strongly condemn the defacing of BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir Toronto with anti-India graffiti. Have requested Canadian authorities to investigate the incident and take prompt action on perpetrators,” the Indian High Commission tweeted.\nIn response to the attack, over 500 Sikhs protested outside the Indian consulate in Toronto claiming that the Indian government was behind the attack on the posters of nationalist Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, who was regarded as a martyr, saint and icon of Khalistan movement.\nDespite the incident, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had not uttered a word condemning the offenders. Not only him, even his coalition partner Jagmeet Singh, who was supposed to protect Indian heritage in Canada, had not spoken a word about it, TFIPOST, an Indian social media platform, said in its report.\nThe Canadian prime minister was quoted as saying “Let me remind you, Canada will always be there to defend the right of peaceful protest. We believe in importance of dialogue and that is why we have reached out through multiple means directly to Indian authorities to highlight our concerns.”",
