The government was examining the factors affecting the natural environment and a comprehensive policy would be made in this regard, he added.\nThe AJK PM said that it was imperative to eliminate environmental pollution and create awareness to protect the natural environment.\nTerming global warming as a biggest threat to humanity, he said that ruthless deforestation, depleting water resources, indiscriminate dumping of garbage in springs and lakes, and deliberate attempts to destroy rivers and canals and erecting illegal constructions pose serious threats to environment.\nHe said that under the given circumstances there was an immediate need to focus on planting more trees, preventing illegal constructions and paying urgent attention to recycling to protect our environment.",
