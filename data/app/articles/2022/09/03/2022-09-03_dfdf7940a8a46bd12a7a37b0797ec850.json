As a result of the sacrifices of the martyrs and their families, we are not only free, but because of them, the atmosphere of peace is established. We can never forget them and we have not forgotten any martyr,” he said.\nIn this month of September, he said we salute all those martyrs and veterans who sacrificed their lives for the country.\n“People’s trust is the asset of Pakistan Army. Pakistan Army has always been at the forefront in helping people in natural calamities and extraordinary situations and keeping this tradition, every effort and resources will be utilized in the flood affected areas. As always, even in this hour of difficulty, with the support of the people, we will get rid of this sudden calamity. Inshallah (by the will of the Almighty)”, he concluded.",
