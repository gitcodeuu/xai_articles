This is an unacceptable and condemnable situation.”The Spokesperson reiterated that a just, peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions and wishes of the Kashmiri people was indispensable for lasting peace in the region.Talking about the recent Amnesty International report, he said, “We have seen the report by Amnesty International and I think it echoes the grave and intensifying human rights abuses in the occupied Jammu and Kashmir by India since 5th August 2019.”The Organization had previously documented these egregious violations in its three reports published in as many years.He said the growing Indian repression and suppression of fundamental rights in IIOJK had been extensively monitored, reported and documented by the UN Human Rights machinery, independent civil society organizations and global media.“The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights as you are aware has also issued two reports in 2018 and 2019. The High Commissioner and several civil society organizations have also consistently raised deep concerns in several sessions of the Human Rights Council over the wide range of human rights crimes being committed by India in the internationally recognized disputed region of Jammu and Kashmir. UN experts have publicly characterized the human rights situation in IIOJK, as in ‘free fall’.”Pakistan once again, urged the United Nations, its human rights machinery as well as States to counsel India to rescind its illegal and unilateral actions taken since 5th August 2019, end forthwith its gross human rights violations of the Kashmiri people, provide access to independent organizations and comply with its international human rights obligations, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
