However, the hurriyat leader urged that the OIC should go step ahead of rhetoric and should take practical and tangible steps to press the Indian government to ensure settlement of decades-old dispute, fearing that the conflict could lead to a nuclear conflict.\nMushaal lamented that India was always trying to mislead the world in UNGA from grave human rights violations and continued genocide of people of the valley.\nTherefore, she appealed that the OIC and the leaders and representatives of the countries participating in the ongoing UNGA should take up the case of Kashmiris vociferously, as the fascist Indian government was trying to change demographic situation of the occupied valley.\nMushaal maintained that time was ripe to force the supremacist Indian government to find out resolution of Kashmir conflict as per the UNSC-agreed formula and aspirations of Kashmiri people.\nShe feared that if the major world powers did not fulfill their responsibilities on the Kashmir issue in time, then Kashmir dispute could lead to a major nuclear conflict because it was not an internal matter of India, but a nuclear flashpoint in South Asia and a matter of political future of the 22 million Kashmiris.\nMushaal said that the fascist Narendra Modi-led government unleashed a wave of barbarism and state terrorism to silence the dissenting voices of Kashmir but all such brutal and inhuman tactics failed to work.\nChairperson urged the world to take cognizant of the grave situation in order to avoid the world worst human tragedy in the valley, as the brutal Indian forces failed to muzzle the dissenting voices; hence now they resorted to silence them permanently by resorting to genocide of Kashmiris.\nShe demanded that the United Nations should send a high-level fact-finding mission to investigate human rights violations and Indian military aggression in IIOJK, besides ensuring permanent and lasting solution of the conflict.",
