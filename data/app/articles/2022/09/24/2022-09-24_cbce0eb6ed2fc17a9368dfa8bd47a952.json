The use of technological advancements was also emphasized in streamlining litigation, he added.\nIn this regard the Chief Justice also informed the participants of the setting up of a National Judicial Automation Unit, approved by the National Judicial (Policy Making) Committee, to help develop a National Online Dashboard for creating an integrated information system for the Judiciary. The first phase of this project is expected to be up and running by and will centralise the data/record of cases pending in all courts on one website.

Members of the judiciary and legal community were also urged to make efforts to enhance their capacity, legal knowledge and performance.\nHe said that the various organs of the state were also prompted to ensure the involvement of women, who form 50% of our population, in decision-making processes.\nThe Chief Justice also urged that efforts be made to effectively eradicate gender based violence, along with other formal and informal biases that women face, both in the workplace and at home.\nHe said that the need to counter problems relating to population growth and climate change on a priority basis was also stressed as these issues are ravaging Pakistan at present.\nThe Chief Justice placed great emphasis on the need for all stakeholders in the justice sector to come together to improve the quality of justice dispensed by the courts.\nHe encouraged the use of training sessions for the police and prosecution to increase conviction rates and reduce crime.\nThe Chief Justice also suggested that District Judges partake in training sessions to learn about amendments and developments in the law and suggested that performance audits be made mandatory in all levels of the judiciary to assess gaps in legal knowledge so that steps may be taken to remedy them. Bar Councils and Associations were also told to take on a more proactive role in the enhancing the legal knowledge of advocates to improve their quality of work.\nHe said that the issues of increasing population, worsening climate change and pervasive gender inequality were said to be hindering effective administration of Justice. In this respect the Chief Justice said that the Supreme Court is committed to protecting the marginalised groups directly affected but the legislature and executive must also do their bit.\nThe Chief Justice concluded his speech stating that it is only through the collective resolution of the stakeholders in the justice sector that Pakistan can become a nation in which the Rule of Law, Democracy and respect for the Constitution will thrive.",
