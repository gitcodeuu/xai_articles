The registration has been opened for two weeks and remaining students can apply for the tests.\nAbdul Qadir Patel said the minimum required percentage to apply for the admissions to MBBS has also been decreased from 65 to 55 percent marks and the requirements for BDS admission has been decreased from 55 to 45 percent marks to discourage tendency of getting admissions abroad.
