General elections would be held next year, he said while talking to a private television channel. Interim set up and early elections are not the solution of any problem in the current situation, he stated and added that Imran Khan was removed through no-confidence move because the representatives of people had no confidence in Pakistan Tehreek e Insaf (PTI) leadership.\nShahid Khaqan Abbassi said the PML-N and coalition partners after\nforming the government, took hard decisions to restore economy. He said that the previous regime of PTI had made tough agreements with International Monetary\nFunds (IMF) and the people are suffering  multiple issues due to weak policies of Imran’s government.\nCommenting on appointment of new army chief, he said that Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif had constitutional right to appoint army chief on merit.\nIn reply to a question about Imran Khan’s political role, he said that PTI leadership was found attacking on national institutions including  judiciary.
