He had weakened the state institutions during his tenure, which was marred by bad governance and corruption, he alleged.\nIt was the Imran-led Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government, which had imposed Rs 50 per litre tax on the petroleum products, he added.\nKhaqan Abbasi said the next general elections would be held after the incumbent government completed its tenure.",
