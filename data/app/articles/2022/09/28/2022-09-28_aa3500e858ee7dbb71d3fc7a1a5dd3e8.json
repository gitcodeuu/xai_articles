Its work started in February 2018 and so far about 59 per cent physical progress has been achieved mainly due to lack of funds availability, the official added.\nHe said its second package the 35 km Khurram-Krapa portion costing Rs 5.927 billion was awarded to the FWO. Its work had started in February 2018 and so far about 58 per cent physical progress has been achieved.\nThe third package of Old Bannu road, 8 kilometer Gaandi Chowk – Sarai Naurang section was awarded to M/s NCC-IKAN-HRPL joint venture at the bid price of Rs 0.718 billion. Work on the package also started in February 2018 and it has already been accomplished. He further said that the existing road was single carriageway which was being dualized and improved. He said the project would provide the heavy traffic movement on Indus Highway (N-55) with an alternate route thus sharing the traffic burden with Indus Highway.\nThe NHA official said that infrastructure development in the less developed areas would contribute to their economic uplift through accelerated trade activities.\nIndus Highway is 1,264 km long that runs along the Indus River connecting port city Karachi with Kohat and Peshawar\nvia D. G. Khan and D.I.Khan. The highway being the second largest road connection after Grand Trunk Road, and provides an alternate north-south link while traversing 491 km in Sindh, 360 km in Punjab and 396 km in KPK, and connecting Rajanpur, D.G.Khan, D.I.Khan, Bannu, Kohat and Peshawar.",
