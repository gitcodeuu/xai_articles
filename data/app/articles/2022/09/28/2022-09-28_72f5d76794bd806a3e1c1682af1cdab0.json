He had now been able to appear before the court after issuance of the travel documents.\nThe court observed that it would hear the main reference and Dar’s petition together. It summoned Ishaq Dar again on October 7, while issuing the notice to NAB.\nThe accountability court on Sept 23 had suspended Dar’s arrest warrants till October 7 on his application filed through his lawyer.
