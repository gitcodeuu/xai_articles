The Visas will remain valid for 90 days from date of issue, Arab News reported.\nPilgrims can also use the portal to book accommodation, flights to and from Makkah, Jeddah and Madinah, and arrange internal travel within the Kingdom.\nThe visa grants pilgrims the freedom to visit several Saudi cities to learn more about the cultural diversity of the Kingdom, the ministry added.",
