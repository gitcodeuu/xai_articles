The rehabilitation of flood-hit areas and people was the top priority of the government.\nShe told that flood affectees were given financial assistance through Benazir Income Support Programme in the country adding that PM Shehbaz Sharif had announced Rs. 25,000 for each flood affected family.\nGiving details about the cash distribution program, she said the program started from Balochistan on August 19 and later extended to deserving families of Sindh, KPK and Punjab. Approximately Rs. 25.49 billion had been distributed among 1.21 million deserving families, she added.\nShe informed that more than 30 districts of Balochistan, 25 of Sindh, 3 of South Punjab and different areas of KPK had been severely affected from these floods.\nShe stressed the need for a planning to cope such natural calamity in future and said there was a need to get ourselves prepare for the disasters like flash floods and heavy rains resulting from climate change on a permanent basis.\nThe minister said that illegal deductions from the amount of cash assistance of Rs. 25,000 provided to flood victims through BISP would not be tolerated at any cost and strict action would be taken against those involved in such activities. We have adopted zero tolerance policy on the complaints received pertaining to illegal deduction from financial aid and lodged FIRs against them and 48 FIRs had been registered in Sindh and a large numbers of people had been arrested, she added.\nShe added that since the disbursement of the financial aid is carried out among the deserving families under the biometric system, there was also a risk of cyber crime. That is why we have approached FIA on few complaints received regarding illegal deduction and such culprits had also been arrested.\nOn this occasion, spokesperson Sindh government Barrister Murtaza Wahab said that the doors of Benazir Income Support Program were not opened for flood affected people in 2020 by PTI government but today there was a coalition government in the federation which had provided relief to flood affected people without any discrimination.\nHe informed that 426 cases of dengue were reported on September 15, after which the administration worked diligently and as a result, the number of those cases reduced to 221 during the last 24 hours.\nHe further said that all the institutions of Pakistan, including the Pakistan Armed forces were working together to provide relief to the flood victims while the anti dengue spray was being carried out on a daily basis in all districts across the Sindh province.",
