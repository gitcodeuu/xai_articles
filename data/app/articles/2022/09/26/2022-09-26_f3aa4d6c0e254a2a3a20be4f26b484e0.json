Its role in the creation of jobs and the livelihood opportunities for the people is well-documented, he added.\nHe viewed that a developing country like Pakistan could benefit immensely from the free flow of international tourists.\n“Alhamdulillah, with the sincere efforts of the government institutions, the pandemic situation in the country has improved manifolds, resulting in the increase in foreign investments in all sectors, including tourism,” he commented.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz said the resumption of economic activities offered immense opportunities to make up for the losses. He said Allah Almighty had blessed Pakistan with huge tourism potential complemented by diversity and richness of cultures and languages as well as warm hospitality of its people.",
