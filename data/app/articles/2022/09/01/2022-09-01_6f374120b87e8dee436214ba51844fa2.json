He was a personification of sheer courage and grit, and the face of the Kashmiri people’s valiant struggle to achieve the right to self-determination as enshrined in numerous UNSC Resolutions. Lovingly called ‘Baba-e-Huriyet’ by his compatriots; he breathed his last in a long-drawn illegal Indian custody on 1 September 2021.”\nThe Indian Charge d’Affaires in Islamabad was called to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today and a strong demarche was made over India’s continued apathy towards the iconic Hurriyat leader’s right to a burial in accordance with his will and the wishes of his family, he added.\nThe Spokesperson said Pakistan’s deep regret was conveyed over the Government of India’s persisting intransigence that had denied Syed Ali Geelani’s mortal remains a dignified burial in the “Cemetery of Martyrs” as per his desire. “More ominously, Kashmiris are not even allowed to pay respects to the revered leader at the graveyard in Hyderpora, Srinagar where he was hurriedly buried last year, as you remember by the Indian occupation forces in the absence of his family and followers.”\n“We believe no amount of Indian brutality, apathy and incredible absence of morality can dampen either the spirit of resistance of the Kashmiris in IIOJK or the fond remembrance of its people for their visionary leaders of the like of Syed Ali Geelani.”\nHe informed that the United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres will be visiting Pakistan on 9-10 September. This will be an important visit. Secretary-General will be here to express solidarity and the international community’s support for Pakistan at this difficult time.\n“Here I would like to highlight that till last night, we have received flood relief goods through 21 flights notably from Turkey, UAE and China. There are trains from Turkey also. These air and across land bridges are expected to continue in the coming days and weeks.”\nA large number of countries and international organizations had pledged support and were extending cash or in-kind assistance including Australia, Azerbaijan, Canada, China, EU, France, Iran, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, New Zealand, Norway, Palestine, Qatar, Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Turkiye, UAE, United Kingdom, the United States, Uzbekistan, along with various international organizations including World Bank, Asian Development Bank and other UN Agencies.“We are grateful for this timely and much-needed support.”\nHe said in complete cognizance of the need to invest in a sustainable future, to avoid falling prey to climate change-induced natural calamities, and mindful of Pakistan’s extreme vulnerability to climate change, Pakistan remained committed to a sustainable, green agenda.\nIn accordance with these objectives, Pakistan had signed the Green Framework Engagement Agreement with Denmark on Wednesday in Copenhagen, he said adding the Green Framework Engagement will mark the first step in creating stronger collaboration in areas such as climate change mitigation and adaptation and a just and sustainable green transition. “A Joint Action Plan will be finalized between the two countries containing specific activities of collaboration,” he added.",
