  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Sep 27 (APP): The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Tuesday expressed annoyance over Awami Muslim League Chief Sheikh Rashid Ahmed for filing a petition of political nature.\nChief Justice IHC Athar Minallah heard the case filed by former interior minister Sheikh Rashid against the appointment of a 72-member cabinet by the federal government.\nDuring the course of proceedings, Justice Minallah censured the petitioner that if such a petition was filed again, the court would impose an exemplary fine over him.\nHe said that the court had always respected the parliament and did not unnecessarily interfere in the authority of the executive. The chief justice asked the petitioner If any of his individual, fundamental rights were affected, then certainly approach the court but not in this manner.\nHe termed the petition baseless and said that the court could impose a fine on such petition but it was showing restraint.\nHe asked the AML chief to take his political fights to the parliament as there was no forum bigger than parliament, he added.\nHe advised Sheikh Rashid to keep courts away from these political matters.\nThe counsel for Sheikh Rashid said that there was no other forum to approach other than the court on the matter raised in the plea.\nChief Justice Athar Minallah said that such petitions should not be filed in court.\nHe said that there were elected representatives in parliament and it was the right forum.\nThe court would not interfere in the matter, he added.\nUpon this, the petitioner said he was willing to withdraw his plea.\nOn which the Chief Justice said that he would pass an appropriate order in this regard.",
