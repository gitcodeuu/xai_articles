No doubt, the flood was a test from the Allah Almighty, but it had also disclosed our shortcomings and negligence, he said proposing dams should be built and the construction of other buildings on the rivers’ banks should not be allowed. He said it should also be investigated why the roads and bridges were made so weak which could not withstand by flash floods.\nHe said Pakistan Army was the pride of the Pakistani nation and the service rendered by it on the instructions of Chief of Army Staff General Qamar Javed Bajwa in this difficult situation were exemplary as per its tradition.\nHe lamented, “It is a pity that the political leaderships of the country could not be united even after the flash floods,” adding the process of reconciliation should be started within the country.\nHe expressed the hope that Punjab Chief Minister Chaudhry Pervez Elahi and President Dr Arif Alvi would play an important role in the process of reconciliation.\nAshrafi also made it clear that neither proscribed outfits were collecting donations not participating in relief work anywhere in Pakistan.\nHe said India wanted to create more difficulties for Pakistan even in this difficult situation adding it aimed to obstruct the aid and cooperation of the world and international organizations helping Pakistan in this trying time.",
