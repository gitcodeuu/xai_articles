So one should not fear death rather wait for it as a new beginning of his life.\nMaulana Jalal-al-Din Muhammad Rumi was born on September 30, 1207 in Balkh (present day Afghanistan) which was part of the ancient Persian empire at that time.\nAhsan Khazaei thanked the participants for attending the class of Masnavi, the famous poem of Maulana being composed in Konya, and said it was an opportunity of increasing ones knowledge about the teachings of Maulana while attending this platform.\nThe Cultural Councilor said, “Maulana was born in Balkh but the Afghans, Turks and others claim him as their national poet. But I want to mention here that such personalities are universal not earthly. It’s not a matter of concern for us rather he was such a great personality that his exhortations through his words are applicable in our practical life.”\nHe underlined that The entire verses of Masnavi and Manavi highlighted moral and ethical values that were equally adoptable in the lives of present time humans.\n“Allama Iqbal Lahori claimed himself as the devotee of Rumi and called him his spiritual teacher. Iqbal derived his motivational and revolutionary poetry from Maulana’s thoughts and advised people to learn from Maulana.”\nThe Cultural Councilor also recited verses of Maulana that meant love of God would remain and rest will be nothing. He said that the Persian verses recited, learn, and explained at the class of Manavi were acting as a cultural bridge between Iran and Pakistan. “It helps the Pakistani people and Iranians to learn each other’s culture and develop a connection between the two nations.”\nHe also presented the book on Persian Literature written and compiled by Dr Arif Noushahi to the participants which was published by the Center for Language Research Republic of Iran.\nProf Dr Muzzaffar Kashmiri held the class of Masnavi and taught the poetry of Maulana Rum to the participants. He informed that the class was being held for the past five years on a fortnightly basis. He remarked that the book of Persian literature was being given to the students as souvenir by the Centre.",
