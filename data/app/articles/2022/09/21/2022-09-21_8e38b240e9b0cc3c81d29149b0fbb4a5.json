The prosecutor gave references of various court verdicts.\nThe chief justice remarked that the accused officers were blamed for misusing their powers, for which a case of misconduct could be framed against them instead of trying them for a crime under the NAB law.\nThe court said if no corruption was involved in their any decision then it was not a crime. In such case how a reference were prepared against the officers, it added.\nNAB had no authority to defame the people, the court noted.\nThe chief justice observed that a defamation case should be lodged against the NAB chairman NAB, who had given approval for the reference.\nThe court subsequently dismissed the NAB reference against the ex-Bureau officials.",
