We are neither seeking, nor do we need, any relief from commercial banks or Eurobond creditors”, he said in his tweet.\n“We have a $1 bn bond due in December which we will pay on time and in full”, he said, adding that the government had been servicing all the commercial debt and would continue to do so.\nHe said Pakistan’s Eurobond debt was only $8 billion due till 2051 which was not a large burden. “A significant portion of our debt is from friendly countries who have said they will re-roll their deposits”, he added.",
