Law is equal for all,” he said in a statement issued by the PM Office.\nPM Sharif stressed that the audio leaks of Imran Khan uncovered the truth about a serious conspiracy against the interests of Pakistan.\n“The thieves caught red-handed now struggle to evade the law by indulging in defamation of the State institutions,” he said.",
