Petitioners’ lawyer Faisal Chaudhry, Barrister Ali Gohar and Additional Attorney General Munawar Iqbal Dogal appeared before the court.\nAt the outset of hearing, the additional attorney general pleaded the court to grant him some time for preparation as he had yet to receive the copy of the petition.\nJustice Aamer Farooq remarked that the people should not be arrested in such a way. The people had to approach the courts when the cases were prepared against them in that way. The governments might change but the institutions would remain the same.\nConsequently, the court adjourned the case.",
