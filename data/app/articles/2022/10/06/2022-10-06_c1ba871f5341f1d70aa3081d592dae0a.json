However, the British industry was supporting Pakistan’s Industry. The longer-term goal for both Pakistan and the UK was to build that trading partnership.\nShe further stated that the UK was also having a very challenging time with its economy. “So it’s in our interests to build that trading relationship and support each other’s economy.”\nAs regards the Kashmir issue, Angela Rayner said the Labour Party had always been committed to supporting the people of Kashmir, and finding a peaceful resolution and supporting the United Nations Security Council resolutions to resolve the dispute.\nMoreover, Pakistan and India had to find a peaceful resolution for the Kashmiri people, which was important because every life lost in the conflict was a loss of humanity, she added.",
