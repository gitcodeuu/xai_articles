I demand all participants to utilise the knowledge acquired from this workshop for nation building and human good,” he said.\nDuring the second day, three technical sessions were held on diverse topics including forecasting of monsoon, weather and climate forecasting and projection in Brazil and media broadcasting, science communication for media in USA, communication of glacier changes in Pakistan, heatwave and adaptation strategies, infodemic of climate change and health, role of media in highlighting climate change impacts on human health, and media reporting on correct use of terminologies.\nThe experts hailing from government departments, academia, private sector and media presented their detailed analysis on various topics of discussion which was followed by an extensive question and answer session.\nChairperson Islamabad Wildlife Management Board (IWMB), Rina Saeed Khan in her vote of thanks said that climate change was an existential threat to mankind whereas the environmental damage once crossed the threshold would be irreversible.\nShe added that the media should have interaction with scientists to write good fact based stories and to understand the nature of environmental issues and their dangerous impacts on the ecology.",
