Indeed, “my visit to the flood affectees area of Tent City is a new experience, where I observed the real challenge unfolding, and we need to prepare for the worst.”\nHe said that Pakistan became ground zero for climate change disasters for the causes where its share is minimal; however, it suffers the most.\nToday Climate change became a reality in which all states and non-state actors should oblige to adopt the do-no-harm doctrine and refrain from wrongdoing that aggravates the unfolding fiasco on planet earth.\nThe Ambassador added that Pakistan can not alone address the unfolding scenarios and that the international community must redouble its effort and ensure justice.",
