The nutritional needs of the new-born children are met for their better nourishment.\nShe also established that the aim of such initiatives of the Government of Pakistan under BISP is to build a strong society. “Today we pledge together that we will continue our efforts to eradicate poverty from Pakistan so that we can give a better future to the coming generations”, the minister concluded.",
