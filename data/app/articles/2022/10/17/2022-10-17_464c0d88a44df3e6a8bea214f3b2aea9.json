The Modi government had issued fake domiciles to 4.2 million non-Muslims to change the demography of Occupied Kashmir.\n“Under the guise of so-called investment, the BJP had allotted land to 4,000 Indian investors in the valley”, he said adding that the Modi government was doing all that to bring a Hindu chief minister in Kashmir.\nAbout persecution of pro-freedom leaders, the president said that India was using its judiciary as a tool to punish Kashmiris.\nThe meeting was also addressed by Syed Aftab Shah, former member of Kashmir Council Sardar Sawar Khan, Malik Imtiaz, Sardar Imtiaz Khan and others.",
