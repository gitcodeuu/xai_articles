The Sindh High Court had issued orders in the public interest, he added.\nThe chief justice said the court would not interfere into the relief work, but the Sindh government would have to satisfy it the flood affectees were getting relief.\nThe Advocate General Sindh told the court that civic committees had been formed to monitor the relief activities. He prayed the court to grant one week time to submit the details.\nFaisal Siddiqui, the lawyer of flood victims, adopted the stance that the people were dying in the flood-hit areas, but still a week time was being sought even in the age of technology.\nThe advocate general said no death would occur due to the delay in getting the answer.\nThe court adjourned the case till October 20.",
