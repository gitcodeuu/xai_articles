  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 27 (APP): Chairperson of Peace and Culture Organisation Mushaal Hussein Mullick Thursday urged the UN bodies to intervene to avoid a further bloodbath in Kashmir and ensure a just resolution of the decades-old dispute as per the UN agreed formula.\nMushaal, the wife of incarcerated senior Hurriyat leader Yasin Malik, said in a statement on “Black Day” marked by Pakistanis and Kashmiris all over the world on October 27 as a protest against Indian illegal occupation of Kashmir on the same date in 1947 that Kashmiris have been resisting the brutal Indian occupation for 75 years.\nShe said Kashmiri people were facing the worst kind of state terrorism as the fascist Narendra Modi government converted Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) into the largest human cage in the world in violation of all existing Human Rights treaties and bindings.\nShe stated that Indian state terrorism crossed all limits of state terrorism to suppress the just movement for the right to self-determination but was of no use.\nSharing detail of Indian state terrorism since 1989, she said that a total of 96,140 people were martyred of which 7,265 were killed in custody and fake encounters.\nMushaal revealed that 165,293 civilians were detained, and 110,494 structures and houses were either destroyed or damaged.\nThe Hurriyat leader further stated that the level of barbarity and state terrorism could be judged from the fact that women were being used as weapons of war as 11,256 women were gang-raped and molested.\nMoreover, she shared that 22,951 women were widowed and 107,883 children were orphaned since 1989.\nShe said that since August 5, 2019, Indian authorities further intensified their wave of terrorism and resorted to carrying out political engineering, demographic marginalization, socio-economic machinations, cultural invasion, media curbs, legal strangulation, and coercion to strengthen its grip over IIOJK.\nMushaal lamented that to permanently merge IIOJK into Indian Union and nullify its disputed character, India has embarked upon unabated machinations against the people of the occupied valley with no pressure from the world community.\nThe Hurriyat leader stated that delimitation was carried out to increase Hindu seats and divide the Muslim vote bank.\nShe went on to say that to shrink space for political activities; Hurriyat leadership was incarcerated and a surge in arrests of innocent youth under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) was witnessed.\nThe Chairperson stated that three prominent Hurriyat leaders Syed Ali Gilani, Muhammad Ashraf Sehrai, and Altaf Ahmed Shah have been killed in custody as a sign of warning to deter the freedom fighters.\nMushaal said that the occupation authorities were even committing economic terrorism, as 1026 government employees were terminated due to links with Hurriyat, raising the unemployment in the valley to 0.5 million.\nThe chairperson stated that the army was empowered to grab land by declaring it as a ‘Strat Area’, besides creating a land bank for outsiders.\nShe revealed that outsider labourers were being facilitated in permanently settling in IIOJK, while 60,000 families were shortlisted and would be denied passports and jobs, denying them basic human rights.\nMushaal lamented that social media activists were being termed as white-collar terrorists.\nUnder the policy of cultural invasion to marginalize Muslims, she said that 50,000 pre-Islamic era Mandirs were being identified and renovated mostly by demolishing mosques, as 6 acres of land were allotted to construct a Mandir in Jammu, besides changing names of 84 places.\nMushaal said that Waqf Bill was passed to control all religious places and their funds and so far over 32,000 dargahs, shrines, mosques, and madrassas have been taken over by the Centre through this board.\n“India’s brutal forces are orchestrating false flag operations and fake encounters to malign the indigenous character of the Kashmir freedom struggle,” she added.\nShe went on to say that Yasin Malik has been awarded life imprisonment with Rs 10 lac fine by the NIA Court for conducting pro-movement activities under the ongoing coercive strategy to suppress the dissenting voices.\nMushaal stated that AJK and Pakistani women who traveled to IIOJK along with their husbands were not provided with the required travel documents.\nThe Hurriyat leader said that despite all these state terrorism and criminal acts by the notorious Indian government, the world powers, human rights organizations, and the UN bodies were looking at the situation as silent spectators.",
