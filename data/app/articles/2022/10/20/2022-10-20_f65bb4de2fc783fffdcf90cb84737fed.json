The NAB prosecutor said the PAC’s para-wise comments were too short.\nTo a court’s query regarding the jurisdiction of PAC, the lawyer said the matter was pending with the inquiry commission. The Federal Government had referred the matter to the commission, he said.\nJahanzeb Bharwana said there was no mention of the PAC’s powers in its comments.\nJustice Farooq remarked that the matter fell in the jurisdiction of Federal Investigation Agency even if the woman’s allegation were accepted as true.\nBharwana said the PAC could seek the record only if there was an inquiry against any officer.\nThe court then sought final arguments on the matter on November 18, and adjourned the case.\nThe PAC had summoned the acting chairman of National Accountability Bureau (NAB) regarding the allegations of harassment by Tayyaba Gul.",
