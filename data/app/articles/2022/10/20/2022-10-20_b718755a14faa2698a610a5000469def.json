Despite the promise of six months, years had passed but still tennis court, squash court and swimming pool facilities had not been provided, he added.\nHe said that all these facilities were for children, but the management was not providing these facilities to children in the club.\nThe court disposed of the petition by directing the petitioner’s lawyer to file a contempt of court petition.",
