About 50 years ago Denmark was also in a situation when it was totally dependent on foreign oil for its power production and then it turned the situation around.\nUlrik said in next five years Denmark’s 100% of power generation would be from renewable sources. The transition Denmark has been through would help Pakistan to transform its energy sector.\nAbout future prospects of Danish-Pakistani collaboration on energy, he said the long term planning was the key which would lead to win the most needed confidence of investors.\nIt merits to be mentioned that the Government of Pakistan has adopted an ambitious policy for alternative and renewable energy (ARE)in order to transform Pakistan’s energy sector and generate 60% of all energy through clean and renewable sources by 2030. In order to support Pakistan’s green transition, the Government of Denmark has entered into a collaboration with Pakistan whereas the relevant technical authorities will exchange knowledge and the Danish authorities will provide technical assistance under the new initiative, Danish Energy Transition Initiative (DETI).\nDETI is a renewable energy project with Danish Investment Fund for developing countries.",
