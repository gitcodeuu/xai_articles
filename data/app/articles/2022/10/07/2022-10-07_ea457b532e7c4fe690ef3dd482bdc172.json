  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP): The second audio leak of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan surfaced on Friday in which he is heard purportedly discussing the ‘cipher’ issue with his party leaders Shireen Mazari and Asad Umar.\nThe trio, in the audio making rounds on the social media, can be heard talking about the ‘cipher’ and its impact on the people in the wake of impending vote on the no-confidence motion against him (Imran Khan) in the National Assembly.\nAt the start of the audio, the voice believed to be of Asad Umar is heard saying: “Another point is in hindsight that whatever we are doing now should have been done at least 10 days ago.”\n“The impact of this letter is far-reaching and it has reached all over the world,” Imran allegedly responds.\n“The strategy is that the masses are with us, and now by this public pressure, we want that whosoever goes for vote in the National Assembly should emerge as ‘branded’. But you should today brand them as Mir Jaffer and Mir Sadiq.\n“The public mind has already been made. You have to just spoon-feed them as the fertile ground is ready,” the former minister adds.\nAnother voice, believed to be of Shireen Mazari, interrupts: “The Chinese even have issued an official statement condemning the US intervention in the internal affairs of Pakistan.”",
