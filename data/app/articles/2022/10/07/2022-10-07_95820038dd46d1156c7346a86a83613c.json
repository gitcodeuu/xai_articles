  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 7 (APP): Some 15,351,388 videos were removed in Pakistan by TikTok for Community Guidelines violations from April 1 to June 30, 2022.\nAbout 97% of the videos were removed within 24 hours for violating the Community Guidelines, 98% were removed before a user reported them, and 97% were removed before having any views, according to the latest Community Guidelines Enforcement Report of TikTok.\nThe report reflected the platform’s ongoing commitment to earning trust by being accountable while working to be safe and welcoming, a TikTok press release said..\n“The latest iteration of the report shows improvements made in countering misinformation and efforts made in the investment in digital literacy education to help get ahead of the problem at scale,” it added.\nIn addition to removing the accounts for violating Community Guidelines, TikTok also removed accounts determined to be spam, along with spam videos posted by those accounts. It also took proactive measures to prevent spam accounts from being created through automated means.\nSince last quarter, TikTok identified 33 new misinformation claims, resulting in the removal of 58,000 videos from the platform globally.\nIn the second quarter of 2022, the total volume of ads removed for violating advertising policies and guidelines decreased.\n“This is due in part to efforts to strengthen account-level detection and enforcement strategies, which have helped improve the ads ecosystem and create better experiences for both users and advertisers,” TikTok said.\nTo further reiterate its commitment to fighting misinformation and ensuring safety, it was introducing a new penalty system “where if someone violates one of its Community Guidelines, their account will accrue a strike for this specific policy violation”.\n“The platform will keep a count of the number of strikes accumulated, and if the person continues posting violent content, they will be permanently banned. The number of strikes leading to a permanent ban depends on the severity of the violation, and the number of total violations,” the press release added.",
