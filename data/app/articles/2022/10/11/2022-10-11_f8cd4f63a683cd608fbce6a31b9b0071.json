  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 11 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi on Tuesday said the best way to address health challenges in Pakistan including dental ailments was to promote the importance of prevention over the curative approach of medical treatment.\nAddressing here at the convocation ceremony of Foundation University College of Dentistry, he said the adoption of preventive practices against diseases would significantly help reduce the number of patients.\nPresident Alvi said dental diseases in the country could be largely overcome by educating people about oral hygiene through regular brushing.\nHe mentioned that proper oral healthcare also contributed to the body’s natural defence mechanism, thus cutting down the chances of several other diseases.\nHe stressed the importance of especially educating children about dental healthcare at school to help them prioritize their own health.\nIn this regard, he said, community involvement was important to spread the message and urged the doctors to demonstrate good communication and empathy while treating their patients.\nDr Alvi lauded the professionalism of the country’s doctors and dentists for contributing towards improving the health of the general public.\nThe president congratulated the young dentists, their parents and teachers on the landmark achievement and expressed satisfaction about a large number of women graduates.\nHowever, he pointed out that a significant number of women doctors left their professions after marriage, thus inflicting a big loss of good human resources to the country.\nDr Alvi called for introducing a ‘feasible’ solution by the institutions such as encouraging part-time jobs for doctors to help them continue with their profession besides raising their families.\nIt was highlighted on the occasion that Foundation University College of Dentistry aimed to educate, research, and contribute to the national and international community of dental professionals.\nPresident Alvi gave away medals to the distinguished graduates who bagged positions in the field of bachelor of dentistry.",
