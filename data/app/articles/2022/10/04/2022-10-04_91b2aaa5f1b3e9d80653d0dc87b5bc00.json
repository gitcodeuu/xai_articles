It is beyond the available resources in many ways for any of us.”\nShe added that the damage was colossal as this was principally because of three different types of flooding including flash flooding, hill torrents and the monster monsoon. They had all clustered in one defining climate disaster to create new records of extreme weather and water volumes, volatility and unpredictability, she added.\nAlmost, 34 districts were still crisis affected with 46,000 square kilometers 16 weeks later in fluid conditions, no pun on water with just again for perspective was more than Switzerland’s entire physical area. “The affected population in these districts is again more than the size of Portugal and Switzerland’s population combined.”\n“These are not statistics you saw that these are real people on the ground whose eyes are still wakened from the shock that they have faced because overnight they have been turned into poster children of extreme vulnerability with futures that are entirely precarious and particularly for women who are layered with another burden of compounded social fragility.”\nShe added that with 11 districts still under water it was quite surreal to see Pakistan Navy deployed in inland terrain to service those who have survived. We have never had the Navy inside the country but it has to.”\nShe told the forum that many still were seeking in land hubs for clean water, food, medical assistance and tragically even dry land in the South in Sindh province to bury their dead. “There wasn’t room or time or space to bury their dead.”\nShe added that the inundation had increased the risk exposure of millions pushed into fresh perils by the health emergency which was now mincing the country.\n“We are urgently in the need of life saving medicines among other things that is all part of your appeal document. And I am sure you can see what else can be sent to the ground.”\nThe Minister highlighted that for the government of Pakistan and its people it was a real race against time as winter was also approaching. “Left to the mercy of open sky, shelters have been made available for some 598,000 masses while over 7.9 million are still scrambling for the dryland as you saw many of them were inundated which we desperately need as cold weather is very near.”\nSherry Rehman noted that some four million people were living in the areas where temperatures reach sub zero and even in the warmest affected areas mercury typically falls below 10 degrees Celsius.\nThe Minister also said that winter was approaching and goods for winter to have the affected survive to another bit of winter was the really need of the hour.\nShe said with FAO survey suggesting 9.4 million acres standing crops damaged but even more acres of standing crops were inundated and affected. “This will directly put at risk 14.6 million who live and work very close to nature in the line of a food sector and agriculture crisis.\nShe added that livelihoods would continue to face severe aftershocks as the cattle etc. were all drowned and 15.4 million more people would be pushed into hard scrabbled poverty and there were already many people.\nThe Minister informed that the relief efforts were also slowed down as the fury of the floods had whipped out over 13,000 kilometers of roads and torn down 440 bridges all over the country. Moreover, the railway lines were still not fully restored in the affected areas.\n“I am here of course to ask for the burden to be shared, meeting the needs on the ground even for the relief phase is beyond the overstretched capacities of any one country especially one [Pakistan] that has been already paying for the climate losses at about 9.1% of our GDP.”\nShe added that Pakistan’s export crops were almost all wiped out particularly in the Sindh province which was half of the country’s food basket. Amid huge quantum of food imports to be made after this flood to feed our people the energy crisis would one of the many to be faced by the nation, she added.\nWith debt payments looming and farmers and many other impacted sectors already demanding loss and damage by the federal government, she said. The country was unable to extend any economic stimulus package that could relieve the stress rather was still battling in a long struggle to save lives and make joint surveys in affected areas, she added.\n“All we are saying is please don’t leave us alone to face the frontline of what the UNSG said was an outcome of mankinds’s war on nature. We have fought enough in another 20 year-long militarized war next door to us, where we lost 80,000 people to the war against violent extremism.\nBut we are NO match for nature’s long war on our doorstep. $300 million per day was spent on the longest military war. Just three days of war funding will save millions more in this appeal.”",
