  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 4 (APP): Speaker National Assembly Raja Pervez Ashraf said on Tuesday that climate justice demanded timely provision of climate funds to developing countries.\nHe also said that further delay in disbursement of pledged funds for mitigating miseries of flood victims could result in irreparable damage to the cause of achieving a cleaner and greener world for all.\nThe speaker expressed these views in his meeting with the Islamabad-based diplomats of the African Bloc of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), at Parliament House, said a news release.\nThe meeting was aimed to garner the support of the IPU’s African Member Parliaments for the National Assembly’s proposal of the creation of a global climate fund through a passage of a resolution in the forthcoming 145th IPU Assembly  in Rwanda from October 15, 2022.\nSpeaker underscored that climate change was one of the greatest challenges of the 21st century.\nHe also said that it had played havoc in Pakistan as millions of people had lost their lives and livelihoods. “Today it is Pakistan but tomorrow it can be any other country,” he added.\nHe stressed that it was essential to sensitize the world about the existential threats faced by the developing nations both in Asia and Africa.\nHe remarked that the international community had come forward to support Pakistan but unfortunately there was more talk than action.\nThe speaker made it clear that that Islamabad was not seeking aid or assistance but the rightful share.\nHe raised the question that why Pakistan would bear the brunt of climate change, caused by the actions of ‘big polluters.’\nHe said that developed nations had to take responsibility for their inability to cut their carbon emissions.\nHe also outlined that National Assembly of Pakistan had proposed an emergency item in forthcoming 145th International Parliamentary union Assembly in Rwanda from October 15, 2022.\nThe proposed item would call for climate justice coupled with creation of global climate fund for developing nations to combat climate induced catastrophes.\nHe mentioned that National Assembly had already dispatched letters to all African parliaments with a request to back Assembly’s proposal, not only for the benefit of Pakistan but also for their own benefit as well. He urged the emissaries to play their due role in the struggle for climate justice.\nAfrican Diplomats agreed with the speaker’s proposal and assured him to pass on the message to the leadership of their respective countries for further action.\nThe dignitaries also highlighted that how rampant climate changes in Africa in the form higher temperatures, drought, changing rainfall patterns, and increased climate variability were impeding human development.\nThe meeting ended on an agreement that “climate change is a global problem and warrants global solution through collective efforts.” The meeting was attended by delegates from Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Somalia & Libya.",
