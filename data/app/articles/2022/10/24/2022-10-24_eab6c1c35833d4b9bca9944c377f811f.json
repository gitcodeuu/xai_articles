  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): Federal Minister Javed Latif Monday said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan, a certified thief, was forced to wind up long march the other day, after seeing people’s lackluster response to his protest call.\nTalking to media persons, he said despite the illegitimate use of provinces’ official machinery, his much hyped long march would also meet the same fate.\nIn spite of cleared routes and minimal restrictions, Imran failed to bring political workers to Islamabad even when he had provided free transport by respective provincial governments, he added.\nThe minister said PTI could be disintegrated if not provided facilitation, adding efforts to disintegrate Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) would never succeed.\n“Imran Khan should be jailed for destroying country’s economy. The decisions of other cases including money laundering case against Imran should be announced,” he added.\nHe lamented that former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was disqualified on flimsy grounds.",
