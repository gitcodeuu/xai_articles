  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): State Minister for Petroleum Musadik Malik on Monday said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan wanted a National Reconciliation Ordinance (NRO) like concession in the Tosha khana through blacking tactics.\n“The PTI chief has been threatening to hold a long-march whose sole purpose is to get his disqualification reversed in the Tosha khana case,” he said while addressing a news conference.\nHe demanded the initiation of criminal proceedings against Imran Khan in line with the verdict of the Election Commission of Pakistan in the Tosha khana case.\nThe minister said Imran Khan had committed the “worst-ever crime” by concealing and selling the gifts he received during his visits to foreign countries as Prime Minister of Pakistan.\nHe alleged that Imran Khan received several gifts during his visits but did not declare them. However, selling those gifts was tantamount to a bigger crime than that.\nMusadik said Imran Khan did not submit any bank statement of the money he earned after selling those gifts.\nHe recalled that Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leader Nawaz Shraif was disqualified for not taking a salary from his son. On the contrary, Imran Khan had been disqualified over corrupt practices.\nThe minister said a small number of people were out on the roads to protest the ECP decision despite the PTI ruling in the two provinces.\nAs regards the availability of gas during the current winter, Musadik assured that the gas availability during this winter season would be better as compared to the previous year. He said the government was making all-out efforts in this regard.\nThe minister said that the government had arranged two additional cargoes of LNG- one each in January and February—that would help better manage energy shortage in the coming winter peak with the support of additional imports of Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).\nHe said the Prime Minister had also directed to arrange more LNG cargoes to provide maximum relief to the consumers.\nMusadik said Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited, Sui Southern Gas Company Limited, PARCO and PSO had also been directed in that regard.",
