The nation has already suffered a lot, he said.\nThe masses were not ready to tolerate such behaviour as they cannot forget what Imran has done to Pakistan.\nNow there was no room for any new favourite, he said adding that\nhow long will Khan remain a favourite as the nation was quite vigilant and won’t allow any deal or NRO (the concession given by former president Musharraf to certain politicians to quash their corruption cases) like to Imran Khan.Now onwards only the constitution and law will have to be followed.\nHe said we don’t believe in revenge, however without accountability of cipher, foreign funding and Toshakhana, the matter can not move forward, everyone should be given equal opportunities.\nHe said level playing field should be provided to all competitors as their race should be started from zero.\n“How a race could be termed fair if one player is placed at no zero and other at no eight,” he added.",
