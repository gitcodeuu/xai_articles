  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 21 (APP):Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Friday said the disqualification of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan in the Toshakhana reference would usher in the national prosperity and development.\n“The country will now prosper as the ‘powerful foreign funded Fitna’ has been finally made subservient to the law,” she said in a news statement while reacting to the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision in the Toshakhana reference.\nShe said Imran Khan would have to go to the jail as the disqualification was not the only legal action he would face for his wrongdoings.\nMarriyum said Imran Khan should realize that his disqualification would not be reversed by attacking the Election Commission.\nShe said the “foreign funded Fitna” had not deposited even a single gift to the Toshakhana since 2019, and failed to produce record in that regard before the ECP which was bound to disqualify him in accordance with the law.",
