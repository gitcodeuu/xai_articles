  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 21 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif Friday regretted that some “power-hungry politicians” were making the country’s youth prey for their partisan agenda, who in fact were a strength for the nation.\nThe prime minister in a tweet said “nations derive their strength from the youth who power their journey and animate their future.”\nHe said this, however, required investment in the development of youth.\nThe prime minister pointed out that “some power-hungry politicians have had no qualms about making them prey for their partisan agenda,” terming it as “unfortunate”.\nOn the contrary, he said his government while “building on the pro-youth work in Punjab, also launched various initiatives yesterday that aim to empower and facilitate the youth to become entrepreneurs.”\nShehbaz Sharif said it was merely a beginning and added that “ lot more will be rolled out in the weeks and months to come.”",
