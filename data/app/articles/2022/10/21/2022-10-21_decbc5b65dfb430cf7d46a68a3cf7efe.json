  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 21 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif on Friday said that the Election Commission of Pakistan’s decision on Toshakhana Reference shattered the “idol” of honesty and truthfulness of Imran Khan.\nThe prime minister’s response came after the Election Commission of Pakistan disqualified PTI chief Imran Khan in the Toshakhana reference under Article 63(1)(p) for making “false statements and incorrect declaration”.\nThe prime minister, in a tweet, said that the Commission had served justice in the case.\n“The nation has witnessed that Imran Khan made personal earning using the office of the Prime Minister. The idol of truthfulness and honesty stands shattered,” he wrote on Twitter.\nHe urged the PTI chief to surrender before the law instead of fighting against law, using bullets and batons and bringing the rioters.\nNo one is above the law, he remarked.",
