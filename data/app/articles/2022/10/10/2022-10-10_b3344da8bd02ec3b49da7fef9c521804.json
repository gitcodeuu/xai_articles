She called upon the hospitals to hold free screening camps to detect breast cancer in women at the earliest stages for reducing the high mortality rate in Pakistan.\nBegum Samina Alvi highlighted that women had to face social pressures and immense physical and mental stress due to breast cancer.\nShe urged the need to provide moral support to women and called for establishing support groups for breast cancer patients and survivors. She also urged women to not ignore their health as their families and the entire nation depended upon them.\nShe expressed her grief over the devastation and loss of lives due to climate change-induced floods in the country. She informed that this year, public and private buildings would not be illuminated in “pink” and the amount saved would be donated to flood victims to alleviate their sufferings.\nCountry Head of WHO, Dr Palitha Mahipala, while addressing the occasion appreciated the efforts of the First Lady for the cause of women in Pakistan.\nHe highlighted that the survival rate of breast cancer patients in high-income countries was almost 80%, which could be replicated in Pakistan through the early detection of breast cancer.\nHe informed that South Asia had one of the highest mortality rates due to breast cancer in the world, adding that self-examination, early detection, clinical examination and early treatment were the best way to cure breast cancer.\nSurgeon General of Pakistan, Lt Gen Nigar Johar, while addressing the ceremony highlighted that 50% population of the country was at risk of breast cancer.\nShe informed that diagnostic and therapeutic facilities in the country had improved, however, she called upon women to develop the habit of examining their breasts and its surrounding areas once a month for early detection.\nIn her presentation, prominent oncologist Dr Abida Khali Sattar said Pakistan had the highest prevalence of breast cancer in South Asia with every one of eight women getting affected by the disease. Around 27% of the breast cancer patients were under 40 age which necessitated the self-examination to ensure its early diagnosis.\nShe said even the United States also reduced the mortality rate of breast cancer in 70s when the country had shortage of treatment and scanning facilities like mammography.",
