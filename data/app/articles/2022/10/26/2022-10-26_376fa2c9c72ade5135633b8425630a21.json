Now in the presence of one million Indian Army, the worst atrocities against the innocent Kashmiris were continuing but could not demoralize their courage, he added.\nKaira said irrespective of political affiliations, every government had voiced the plight of Kashmiris at home and internationally which would continue.\nThere had been some semblance of support from the Muslim countries on Kashmir issue, however, there was a need to bring the international community together in discrediting the abuse of power in the held valley at the hands of a fascist Indian government, he added.\nKaira called for keeping the youth aware of the government’s efforts for Kashmir and the importance of Kashmir as the unfinished agenda of partition to keep them motivated and save them from hopelessness.\nTerming Kashmir a human rights issue, he said that no one could be subdued through the use of brute force in the twenty-first century.\nHe added that Pakistan’s main dispute with India was Kashmir and it would keep providing moral and diplomatic support to the Kashmiris in their just struggle.\nPakistan was never the aggressor and it would never choose to be one in the times that follow, however, Kashmir was one issue that commanded absolute resolve and commitment for Pakistan, he pledged.\nKaira said that Pakistan Peoples Party was the first political party that included the Kashmir dispute in its manifesto and Pakistan’s independence was incomplete till the freedom of IIOJK.",
