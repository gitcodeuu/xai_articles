He is using tragic killing of Arshad Sharif for petty politics and going to the extent of casting aspersions on state institutions,” the prime minister wrote on Twitter, prior to concluding his visit to Saudi Arabia where he attended an investment summit, offeree Umrah and paid respects at Roza-e-Rasool  (Peace Be Upon Him).\nThe prime minister urged the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chairman Imran Khan to be patient and wait for findings of Judicial Commission instead of resorting to the baseless allegations.\nOn Tuesday, the prime minister had decided that Arshad Sharif’s killing in Kenya would be probed by a high level judicial commission for what the government would request the Islamabad High Court to designate a judge for the purpose.\nHe also assured the nation for a transparent probe into the tragic incident and bringing forth the facts to the nation.",
