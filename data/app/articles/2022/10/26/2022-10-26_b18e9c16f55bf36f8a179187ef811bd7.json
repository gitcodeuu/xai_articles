The APHC, in a statement in Srinagar, asked the Kashmiris to demonstrate to the world that they would not rest till Jammu and Kashmir was liberated from Indian slavery.\nIt urged the global community to give up its criminal silence on the Indian brutalities in IIOJK and take practical steps to force New Delhi to give the Kashmiris their right to self-determination as per the UN Security Council resolutions.\nMeanwhile, posters appeared in Srinagar and other parts of the territory, urging people to observe shutdown in IIOJK, tomorrow, against the illegal occupation of their motherland by India.\nIt was on October 27, 1947 when Indian troops in total violation of the spirit of the Partition Plan of the Subcontinent had militarily invaded Jammu and Kashmir and illegally occupied it against the will of the Kashmiri people.",
