In this regard, the cabinet ratified ECC’s decision of approval for Rs3.2 billion supplementary grant to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA),  for the purchase of wheat seed and for certain districts as identified by the provinces. The cabinet tasked the NDMA for the purchase of seed for the next cultivation of wheat crop in the flood-hit areas which would ensure completion of this process prior to the cultivation season.\n3.
