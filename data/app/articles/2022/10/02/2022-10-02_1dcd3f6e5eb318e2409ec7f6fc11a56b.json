Moreover, more than 2,000 cars reportedly took part in the rally.\nThe campaign has raised awareness in the global community with regards to atrocities committed against Sikhs by India and it is believed it will further pressurize India to hold an official referendum.\nDuring the press briefing to media outlets before the referendum, Pannu showed the Khalistan map with Shimla as its capital.\nThe Indian government urged its Canadian counterpart to act against the rising pro-Khalistani sentiment in Canada, which is home to over one million Sikhs but Canada has said it will not suppresses the right of its free citizens to do as they like.\nThe Indian government tried to apply diplomatic pressure on the Canadian government ahead of the Khalistan referendum voting but failed.",
