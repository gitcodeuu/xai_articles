  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 23 (APP): Stifling of basic rights of the freedom of speech and expression has now became a perpetual bane in the RSS dominated Indian society as a court in Kerala on Tuesday directed the police to register a case against Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPIM) backed legislator and former minister KT Jaleel on his “Azad Kashmir” and “India occupied Kashmir” remarks.\nAccording to Indian media, a petition was moved by RSS leader Arun Mohan before the Thiruvalla judicial first class magistrate court after the former MLA eulogized ‘Azad Kashmir’ in a Facebook post.\nThe Thavanur MLA had recently visited Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu Kashmir (IIOJK) and shared images and detailed accounts of his travels.\nJaleel mentioned “India-occupied Jammu and Kashmir” which comprised Jammu, Kashmir valley and Ladakh and also criticized the Indian government’s decision to revoke IIOJK’s special status.\nThe comments had sparked protest in Kerala with the BJP demanding that a sedition case be registered against Jaleel, who had served as the higher education minister in the previous CPIM government led by Pinarayi Vijayan.\nIndian media said, earlier, a complaint was filed at the Kirvaipur Police station which was declined.\nBy these measures, the Indian government perpetually resorted to falsehood to promote its anti-Pak narrative.\nIn his posts, the MLA said the government of Pakistan had extended all rights to the people in AJK who had been enjoying equal opportunities and basic facilities.",
