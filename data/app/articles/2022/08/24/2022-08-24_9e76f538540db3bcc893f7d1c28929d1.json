  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 24 (APP): President Dr. Arif Alvi on Wednesday called for addressing various issues in the health sector including stunting and malnutrition in children, mother and child health care, and lack of health facilities for the masses, especially in rural areas of the country.\nThe President was talking to the United Nations World Food Programme’s (UNWFP’s) Special Advisor on Mother and Child Nutrition, Princess Sarah Zeid of Jordan, who called on him here.\nHe said that the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) and the UNWFP were collaborating to launch the country’s largest national flagship stunting prevention programme named the Benazir Nashonuma Programme (BNP) which would initially target 1.5 million pregnant women, lactating mothers and children who were registered with BISP as the vulnerable segment of the population.\nThe President appreciated the role of all stakeholders, public and private sector and international organizations such as UNWFP, UNICEF, WHO, and UNFPA for their effective and sustained professional support and commitment to this important initiative, especially during the first 1000 days of maternal and child health which were crucial in overcoming stunting and malnutrition in children.\nTalking about the population growth, he said that around 10 million annual pregnancies in Pakistan could be reduced by 50% by improving people’s access to contraceptives and Intrauterine devices to prevent unwanted pregnancies, a press release issued by the President’s Media Wing here said.\nThe President said that close and effective coordination at the government level and with the private, semi-private and international relevant organizations was paramount to chalk out a time-bound national action program with a clear vision, mission and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to bring about a substantial reduction in the country’s population growth rate which was putting an enormous burden on its scarce economic and financial resources\nHe said that the empowerment, education and training of women were essential for women’s health and for raising healthy families and controlling the population.\nWhile emphasizing the importance of information, communication and outreach for gathering the support of the target population for family planning, the President cited the example of the breast cancer awareness campaign, wherein due to a comprehensive communication and outreach strategy, an increasing number of women were opting for early consultation and diagnosis of this disease which had helped in its early cure.\nHe called upon the business leaders, eminent women, politicians and members of the civil society to play their role in economically and financially empowering women and encouraging them to play an active role to bring about a fundamental improvement in the economic outlook of the country.\nThe President said that Islam had given the right of inheritance to women and empowered them financially but unfortunately in Pakistan, women were being deprived of their rights in favour of their male family members.\nHe said that the Enforcement of Women’s Property Rights Act had empowered women to claim their share in the inherited property which would help in their economic and financial empowerment.",
