It is a serious humanitarian disaster,” the Minister said.\nTo a query, she said the country had never seen in the living history such relentless monsoon rains with six and seven spells, adding, “Pakistan is undergoing the eighth cycle of relentless monsoon rains that has no such precedent before.”\nShe mentioned that it barely gave the government a gap of half a day or one day as for instance in Karachi the city received 400mm rainfall within a few hours.\nResponding to another query, she said no city was structured or geared up for that type of climate resilience that it could cope with such an amount of water in a very short time.\n“It’s literally buckets pouring down and everyone is caught unprepared. We have a monsoon season every year but this is nothing like that… it is a torrential downpour of biblical proportion”.\nThe country has received a massive rainfall during the prevailing monsoon season that crippled its connectivity routes and infrastructure and left thousands destitute due to heavy inundation.The governments at provincial and federal levels along with it’s Armed Forces are busy in resuce and relief efforts.",
