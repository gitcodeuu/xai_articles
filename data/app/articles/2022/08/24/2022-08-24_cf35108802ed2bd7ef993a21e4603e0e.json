Each artist has a different practice along with their distinct visual language projected in their work, he added.\nThe official said ‘Scenic Pakistan’ is an example of how big of a tool visual art can be not only for the present time but in recording history and culture as well.\nThe show was visited by a large number of audiences including artists, students, VIPs, government officials and media persons.\nThe show includes A.R Nagori, Ahmed Habib, Anjum Ayub Khan, Aqeel Solangi, Aslam Minhas, Bashir Mirza, Colin David, Ghalib Baqir, Ghazanfar Ali, Ghulam Rasul,  Masood A.
