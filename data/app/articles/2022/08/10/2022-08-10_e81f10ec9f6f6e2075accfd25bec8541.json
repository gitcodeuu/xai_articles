The House unanimously approved the motion to de-seat Muhammad Mian Soomro.\nVeteran politician Soomro was elected from NA-196, Jacobabad as a MNA on PTI ticket in 2018.\nIt should be noted that earlier the resignations of 11 PTI MNAs were accepted for which the by-election schedule had already been issued.",
