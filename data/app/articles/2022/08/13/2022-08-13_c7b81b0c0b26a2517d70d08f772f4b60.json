The country became nuclear power during the democratic rule of PML-N leader Nawaz Sharif who connected all federating units by establishing network of the motorway across the country.\nShe said it was Nawaz Sharif who completed the nuclear programme initiated by Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto in 1970s.
