He said that the Indian occupying forces have been given a free license to kill innocent Kashmiris.\n“The United Nations, OIC and other influential world institutions should take notice of the ongoing brutality and barbarism in the Occupied Kashmir and play their role to resolve the lingering dispute that has been main cause and consequence of rights violations and bloodshed in the region”, the PM added.",
