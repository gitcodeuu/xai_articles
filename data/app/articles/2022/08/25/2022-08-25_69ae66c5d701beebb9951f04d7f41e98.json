It recognizes individuals from around the world in its annual conference for outstanding research contribution in different fields of the clinical chemistry.\nProf. Dilshad was given “2022 Abstract Award for Outstanding Research in Molecular Pathology or Pharmacogenomics” for his meritorious research contributions for better patients care during its Annual Scientific Meeting held in Chicago recently.\nProf. Dilshad who is working as Director Academics in NUMS has developed “micro RNA panel for early diagnosis of coronary artery disease in patients with angina.”\n“The panel of miRNA (miRNA-33a, miRNA-133a, and miRNA-146a) has a diagnostic role in early detection of coronary artery disease in patients with angina. It can be used as non-invasive biochemical marker to discriminate healthy individuals from coronary artery disease patients before undergoing angiography,” said Prof. Dilshad.\nThese miRNAs can also be used for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease in medical set ups where cath facilities are not available, he added.",
