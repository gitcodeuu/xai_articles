  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 1 (APP): The U.S. Embassy has organized 3-day Online Professional English Network (OPEN) Alumni Conference 2022 for over 500 English language professionals across Pakistan enabling participants to learn different tools and techniques to instill intercultural knowledge, attitudes, skills, and awareness in the English language teaching context.\nThe conference theme, “Fostering Intercultural Competence (ICC) in the EFL Classroom,” promoted ICC as an essential aspect of English language teaching and learning.\nIt was offered in a hybrid mode with 60 alumni participating in person in Islamabad and others joining virtually, said a press release of the U.S. Embassy issued here Monday.\nThe conference offered 25 interactive sessions, led by English Language Specialist from the United States Dr. Lynn Zimmerman and Pakistani English language teaching experts.\nAddressing the concluding session, acting Country Public Affairs Officer of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad Aaron Tarver recognized the incredible work of the Pakistani English teaching community and acknowledged their enthusiasm, motivation, and perseverance towards their own professional growth, which has motivated the United States to provide $24 million to fund English language programs.\n“This event is another opportunity for the United States and Pakistan to celebrate 75 years of diplomatic relations, but more importantly to celebrate 75 years of friendship, said Tarver to the OPEN Alumni.\nHe said: “We are collaborating closely on many valuable projects across the spectrum – supporting Pakistan’s goals to be a more prosperous and healthier nation through trade and investment, entrepreneurship support, and long-standing support in public health, including providing over 60 million COVID vaccine doses, and of course, education. You and your students are the exciting next chapter of that relationship,” he said.\nThe Online Professional English Network (OPEN) program offers virtual learning opportunities to foreign English language educators, professionals, and learners worldwide. OPEN promotes the mutual exchange of culture and provides free access to teaching and learning materials which can be reused, adapted, and shared with others.\nOPEN professional development opportunities are developed by U.S. academic institutions and experts in the field of Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), the press release said.",
