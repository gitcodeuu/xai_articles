  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 15 (APP): Special Assistant to the Prime Minister Attaullah Tarar on Monday said the ‘politics of hatred and anarchy’ could not be allowed in the country and the law enforcement agencies would fulfill their responsibilities in that regard and take action against its perpetrators.\nAddressing a press conference here, Tarar said those creating chaos were at the same time making a hue and cry in order to escape from the long arm of the law, but they would not be spared. The government would ensure full protection to the lives and properties of citizens.\nHe said those who had set the green belt and metro stations in Islamabad on fire, killed a policeman Kamal, broken the parliament’s gate, tortured SSP Asmatullah Junejo and attacked the PTV building, would no more be let scot free. They would face the music as the law would take its due course.\nThe SAPM said the leaders of both Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) were victimized during the government of Imran Khan Niazi as many of them remained in the custody of National Accountability Bureau (NAB) on 90-day remand in different cases.\nImran Khan used to send any of rivals behind the bars at his will, however, “we never tried to incite the people to revolt against him”, he added.\nA daughter (Maryam Nawaz) was arrested when she went to visit her father in jail, he recalled. The PML-N leaders and capable bureaucrats like Ahad Cheema had to face hardships in barracks, Tarar added.\nThe SAPM said Imran Khan as prime minister had no botheration about the ‘sinking economy’, but he was keen that his jailed opponents should not get the facility of fans (in hot weather) or they had to sleep on floor without blankets (in cold weather).\nHe said many politicians had to face difficulties in the past, but they never tried to promote anti-state narratives. “Now one of your (Imran Khan) men has spoken against the institutions, and there is need for his further physical remand for investigation to know as who else was involved with him in the conspiracy,” he added.\nHe said Imran Khan had not disassociated himself from Shehbaz Gill’s statement or denotified him as his chief of staff. Gill had a green card, which was valid upto 2025, while he had been getting salary in dollars from a university in the United States.\nThe people with such background did not feel ashamed to talk about a self-created conspiracy to oust their government, he added.\nTarar claimed that Pervaiz Elahi was trying to appease Imran Khan to retain his chief ministership, as evident from his statement against Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah at the public gathering in his (Imran’s) presence.\nHe said,”It was a matter of shame that Imran Khan openly appreciated the foreign policy being pursued by India.” He also propagated his mantra of importing petroleum products from Russia, but no minutes of any meeting in that respect were available, he added.\nHe criticized the Punjab government over registration of a first information report (FIR) against him (Tarar) related to alleged torture on a security official of the legislature and delivering a notice in that regard at two wrong addresses.\nThe SAPM advised the provincial government to better focus on improving its governance rather than pursuing the ‘politics of revenge’ as the crime rate in Punjab was increasing with each passing day.\nHe said a petition had been accepted by a relevant court against the election of Punjab Assembly speaker, which should have been held through secret balloting according to the rules of procedure and conduct of business in the House.\nTo a question, Tarar said multiple steps were taken during his tenure as Punjab home minister for prevention of child abuse and gender crime. Even emergency was declared in the province to check such incidents.\nHe said the Islamabad High Court had granted a 14-day protective bail to him, as a legal team would pursue his case.\nTo another query, the SAPM said Imran Khan would be made accountable for receiving prohibited foreign funding.",
