  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 12 (APP): The ancestors of the country demanded the nation to reawaken the spirit of national unity, patriotism and father of the nation Quaid-i-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah’s motto of Faith, Unity and Discipline to fight the prevailing crises and many other pressing issues.\nThe pioneers of the Pakistan Movement who saw the Muslims of the sub-continent emerging as a nation-state on the map of the world revive the passion for patriotism and selfless devotion that lead to a separate homeland where they could live their lives peacefully as per their religious, social customs and traditions.\nAbdul Razzaq Malik told APP that his mother and father migrated from eastern Punjab to join Pakistan and left their family property, heritage, and centuries-old stature of the clan and unflinchingly resolved to embrace their true state and their last abode forever.\nHe narrated his mother’s account of migration at the time of partition she started her journey from Ludhiana with her relatives, where her father and younger sister were left behind who travelled on foot throughout the journey and came to Pakistan later.\n“My mother Sarwari Begum was the daughter of a landlord (Muhammad Bukkush) who also owned a few soap manufacturing factories and he used to sell the soap in Rawalpindi. She used to recall the day of partition that was somewhat tumultuous and abrupt due to sudden gloomy events of bloodshed that prevailed after riots broke out,” he recalled with calm eyes recalling the pain he felt in her mother’s eyes.\nRazzaq said the day of riots in Ludhiana was probably one of the last days of Ramazan Ul Mubarak as Ms Sarwari used to remember that both her mother and she were preparing vermicelli (Sawiyan) as dessert to be served on Eid Day.\n“The next thing was unimaginable as her father rushed into the home and asked her mother to just take all the kids with her and leave as soon as possible because Hindu and Sikh mobs had started killing Muslims and there is no other way out now, they had to rush,” he continued the tale of her parent’s journey to Pakistan.\n“The most painful thing her mother told her was that there used to live a Sikh family in their neighbourhood and especially an old man who used to listen to Ms Sarwari’s recitation of Holy Quran.\n“My mother used to have a balcony in her room which was at the second storey of her house and had a closed door to see out and was mostly closed, but due to close proximity and her loud voice of recitation the old man could hear and respond her when she halted, “Why you stopped my child? Continue reciting Quran it pleases me.”\n“But, the fire of hatred and politics, let such relationships tainted with bloodshed, he said and revealed that the old man was the first to attack her family. “It was a hair breath escape and my maternal grandfather with her younger daughter managed to leave Ludhiana without any farewell, aching heart and running eyes. My mother, maternal grandmother and her brothers managed to board on a truck of her maternal uncle who was in the British Army and allotted a truck to safely take his family to Pakistan,”\nAbdul Razzaq said while continuing the journey of migration which was the largest in recorded history of mankind. “Maternal grandfather and her aunt travelled on foot throughout their journey when she felt thirsty he had kept his turban wet wherever found any water during his journey and used to squeeze it to offer her water to quench her little daughter’s thirst,” he added.\nWhen questioned about her father, he said his father belonged to Philor, Jalandhar where his tribe was based for centuries and owned a huge estate and house, whereas “my paternal grandfather and great grandfather’s burial were submerged there before partition.\n“My father (Mohammad Sadiq) came to visit his cousins in Lahore as he used to tell us that suddenly it was announced that the situation across the entire Punjab has gone worst due to unrest and bloodshed amid migration toward India and Pakistan.\n“His family, including only his widowed mother and two younger sisters also travelled along Ms Sarwari’s family in that truck where they reached after leaving Philor in the same manner as my maternal Grandparents did,” Abdul Razzaq concluded the journey with a heavy heart.\n“My father once asked me that if someone enter your courtyard and shout that he’s going to slap your mother. What will you do? And I promptly replied that I would make history on that day by shredding my enemy into pieces. He then replied that this you would have to replicate if someone attacks your country, not a single iota of emotions should be reduced,” he concluded his message learnt from his parents and he transferred through the next generations on this Independence Day.\nHe said the country is undergoing unprecedented challenges of economic, political and security issues which can only be confronted with the support of the nation and every individual has to revive the iconic passion of patriotism to serve the country in this hard time of rapidly transforming global and regional situation.",
