But he had managed the process and settled the matter against his alleged share,” the minister said.\nThe second case , he said was related to the Arif Masood Naqvi who would be sentenced 290 years imprisonment in the UK for money laundering. Imran Khan during his regime waived off Rs 250 billion investment to be made by K-Electric in Dattang Coal Project which would have benefited Karachiites.\n“Asad Umar dictated the decision in CCOE and the members present on the occasion resisted to circumvent the decision as K-Electric has to do the investment pledged 20 years back.\nThe Dattang project was in its final stages and the Rs 250 billion investment was turned down for just 2-3 billion pounds,” he maintained.\nThe minister urged the PTI leadership not to criticize national institution which were already paying heavy price for the national security.\nTo a query, he said the government was making all out efforts to overcome energy shortage in the country.\nKeeping in view the steps taken by the incumbent government, he said “We are hopeful that the energy crisis will be overcome in next few months,” however, he regretted that previous government of PTI failed to arrange gas and other fuel as per needs of the country that resulted in power shortage.",
