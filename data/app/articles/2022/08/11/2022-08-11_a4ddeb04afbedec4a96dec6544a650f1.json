  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 11 (APP): Federal Minister for Climate Change Senator Sherry Rehman on Thursday said abnormal monsoon rains would remain a regular feature and the country’s overall infrastructure was not ready for such disasters which would lead to severe humanitarian crisis.\nThe minister was expressing these views at the Senate Standing Committee on Climate Change presided by Senator Seemee Ezdi held here that discussed the prevailing weather conditions, monsoon rain damages and glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs) events management.\nSherry briefed the forum that the Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) or MET office, which comes under the Ministry of Aviation, was responsible for weather warnings. She said that it was the role of the provincial government for preventive measures and rescue and relief operations.\nShe added the MET office warnings which were loud and clear, were of no use since the provincial governments did not have the capacity to rescue a disaster because of its infrastructure, road construction and poor rain water drainage system.\nShe said that as long as the nullahs (water channels) would not be cleared and the country would not equip itself with enough resources there would be no way forward. “All the stake holders should sit together and work on a plan each contributing to redress this problem which will now seem to occur regularly as the climate change occurs globally.”\nSenator Taj Haider, while discussing possible solutions to address such calamities, said the country was also lacking water reservoirs, through which adversity could be changed into opportunity and accumulate water, addressing the issue of water scarcity.\nThe Secretary Ministry for Climate Change also argued that early warning was area-specific as certain areas could not forecast due to lack of modern equipment. He said that one million people were residing at the bed of the River Indus when the flood occured and these residents disseminated in the local area which continued to disrupt the rescue and relief operation.\nThe committee unanimously believed that a national action plan and its implementation is the need of the day.\nSenator Farooq Hamid Naek also pointed out that concurrent list was missing which had also led to climate disaster in the country. The committee stressed that it’s the time legislation should be formulated to prepare the country for natural disasters due to rapid climate change globally.\nIt was also decided to work on national simulation exercise to validate and enhance preparedness and response plans, procedures and systems for all hazards and capabilities.\nSenator Faisal Javed also proposed the committee to take briefing from the Ministry of Climate Change on the National Adaptation Policies for Climate Change on priority basis in the next meeting.\nThe chairman National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) briefed the committee that the National Emergency Operation Center (NEOC) was operational 24/7 which was continuously monitoring daily occurrences and was in coordination with all disaster management stakeholders including the UN agencies, donor NGO’s and media.\nHe informed that Pakistan was amongst the top ten vulnerable countries in global climate risk index.\nThe committee was briefed that the NDMA exercised multiple scenarios on 28th and 29th June for better assimilation of disasters.\nThe committee was also briefed by the NDMA on mass awareness programs and rescue activities.
