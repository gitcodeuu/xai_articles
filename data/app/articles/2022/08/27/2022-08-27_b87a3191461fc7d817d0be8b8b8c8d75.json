He expressed the hope that the international community would contribute to meeting the funding requirements of the Flash Appeal.\nIn the bilateral context, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif reaffirmed commitment to boost relations in all areas. He also conveyed appreciation for Iran’s steadfast support to the people of Jammu and Kashmir.\nLater in a tweet, the Prime Minister thanked the Iranian President for his message of support and solidarity.",
