India’s illegal and unilateral actions of 5 August 2019 were aimed at undermining the internationally recognized disputed status of Jammu and Kashmir, and altering the demographic structure of IIOJK in blatant violation of the United Nations Security Council Resolutions and international law including 4th Geneva Convention. These steps were forcefully rejected by Pakistan, the Kashmiris, and the international community, he added.\nForeign Secretary Sohail Mahmood highlighted that the Jammu and Kashmir dispute had remained unresolved primarily due to India’s failure to implement the resolutions of the Security Council which stipulated that the final disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir shall be made in accordance with the will of the people expressed through the democratic method of a free and impartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of the United Nations.\nHe underscored that the ceasefire understanding of 25 February, 2021 along the Line of Control (LOC) was a prime example of Pakistan’s efforts for maintaining peace along the LOC, to save precious Kashmiri lives and to alleviate the sufferings of Kashmiris living along both sides of the LOC.\nSadly, he said the Indian actions of 5 August 2019 were a huge setback to our efforts to build regional peace. Onus was on India to create an enabling environment for meaningful engagement.",
