Unprecedented levels of cloud bursts and torrential rains had triggered widespread devastation, urban flooding, river floods and landslides, resulting in the loss of human life, livelihoods and livestock.\nTerming year’s super floods as a climate calamity-induced destruction, he said “what we are facing today has been no above average monsoon. It is an entirely new level of climate-led catastrophe.”\nThe foreign minister said the rainfall in Pakistan since mid-June had been equivalent to three times the 30-year national average and the southern, central and northern regions of the country were worst affected.\nBilawal said millions were displaced who had been now spending days and nights, in camps, in the open skies, adding they were in dire need of clean drinking water, food and shelters.\nThe roads infrastructure had been damaged impeding their efforts to relocate and provide support to the flood-trapped people, he said, adding it was a national emergency and life-defining moment.\nThe foreign minister said Pakistan required financial assistance besides, urgently needed shelters, food, non-food, and other basic items.\nRecounting his personal experiences, the foreign minister said that he had seen pains and agonies in the eyes of affectees who had lost everything they once owned, and were uncertain about their future.\nIn addition to the human miseries, the natural catastrophe had also impacted the country’s limited economic resources, he added.\nHe also highlighted the government’s relief measures including cash payments to each affected family and the compensation amount for the loss of lives and damaged homes.\nForeign Minister Bilawal further said that the government had also established PM Relief Fund 2022 to receive donations.\nHe said the government was cognizant of its responsibility and had allocated $173 million to help flood-hit people through direct cash transfers which would be disbursed through the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP) to 1.5 million families who will each receive Rs25,000 ($115) in immediate cash relief.\nSeparately, Rs5 billion ($23 million) had been allocated to the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) for relief activities, he added.\n“The government is also providing Rs1 million compensation to the next of kin of each deceased; Rs250,000 for injuries and partially damaged houses; and Rs500,000 for destroyed houses,” he added.\nHe also thanked the countries, UN, development partners and others for extending support to Pakistan and expressed the optimism that other countries would fully back such relief efforts.\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, in a video message for the launch of the appeal in Islamabad and Geneva, said the UN issued a flash appeal for $160 million to help Pakistan cope with catastrophic floods.\nHe said Pakistan was awash in suffering. “The Pakistani people are facing a monsoon on steroids — the relentless impact of epochal levels of rain and flooding.”\nJulien Harneis, UN Resident Coordinator and Humanitarian Coordinator in Pakistan, also highlighted the scale of destruction caused by natural calamity and the country’s requirements to cope with the situation.\nChairman National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) Lt. Gen. Akhtar Nawaz also briefed the session about the floods response plan and the situation in the aftermath of floods.\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Resident Coordinator in Islamabad, and the Assistant Secretary General of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) also spoke on the occasion.\nMinister for Planning, Chairman Relief Coordination Committee Ahsan Iqbal briefed the session about the relief and rehabilitation efforts and the continuing situation.\nThe launching event is being attended by all UN Member States as well as various UN agencies and humanitarian organizations working in the area of disaster relief.
