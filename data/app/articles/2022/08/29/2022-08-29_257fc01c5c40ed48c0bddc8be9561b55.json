  "content": "MOHMAND, Aug 29 (APP): Prime Minister Muhammad Shehbaz Sharif on Monday stressed that there was need to immediately shift country’s power generation capacity to solar and wind power production systems as the costly power generation was continuously depleting the national exchequer.\nDuring a briefing at the Mohmand Dam site, the prime minister said Pakistan had been facing a very acute problem of expensive power generation due to import of expensive fuels, and then subsidizing it for the consumers.\nHe said it was three-tier losses to the national exchequer, as the country had been importing costly fuels for the power generation and then reducing the cost of the power for the consumers.\nThe prime minister referring to the timely completion of the hydel power projects, opined that these hydel power projects and tapping of other natural resources like solar and wind ‘are our future and we need to immediately shift to that direction, otherwise the economy will continue bleeding annually’.\nThe prime minister also expressed his serious concerns over the damages caused to dykes and the construction site of the dam in the recent floods, and said that would delay its completion time and could hamper country’s progress.\nHe said the construction of dam was carried out by the Chinese and Pakistani people, and it would generate 800 MWs of inexpensive power besides, helping in water reservation and providing protection against flash flooding.\nThe prime minister also appreciated China as a best friend of Pakistan, and said they had complete confidence in its support.\nAbout the recent floods, he reiterated that with collective efforts and support of the people, they would overcome the losses.\nIt was important to understand that the government had to provide affordable hydel power to the consumers and industries, and if the production was costly due to expensive fuels import, it would continue to cause colossal losses, he added.\nThe prime minister cautioned that the national exchequer and resources would not be sufficed to meet such expensive production of power.\nFor the production of power with the help of solar and wind power systems, the natural resources should be tapped, like construction of dams which would be helpful in the storage of water.\nUnderlining the need for timely completion of dams, he said country’s progress prosperity and economic development hinged upon their full and timely functioning.\nThe prime minister directed the relevant authorities to investigate the matter of impacts caused by recent flood by hiring an independent third party.\nHe said there was need to look into the factors as to why dams were breached with floods and what steps would be taken to avoid such damages in future along with devising a future roadmap.\nThe prime minister expressing his concerns said that such thing had happened in the Neelum-Jhelum power project and now occurred here due to floods.\nHe said in the Neelum-Jhelum project, they had decided to hire independent consultants to thoroughly investigate the issue in a transparent manner.\nEarlier, Wapda Chairman Lt Gen (retd) Sajjad Ghani gave a briefing over the project.\nMohmand Dam is being constructed on River Swat in District Mohmand of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which would be completed in 2026.\nOn completion, the dam will store about 1.2 million acre feet (MAF) of water and help mitigate floods in Peshawar, Charsadda and Nowshera. Besides, supplementing 160,000 acres of existing land, about 18,237 acres of new land will also be irrigated.\nMohmand Dam Power House will generate 800 megawatts (MW) of hydel electricity, contributing 2.86 billion units of low-cost and environment-friendly hydel electricity annually to the national grid. Annual benefits of the project have been estimated at Rs51.6 billion.",
