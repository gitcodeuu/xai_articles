  "content": "PESHAWAR, Aug 29 (APP): The International Water Management Institute (IWMI), a research for development organization, has offered its support to Government of Pakistan for flood damage assessment and aiding recovery efforts, following the extreme flooding events across the country.\nIn a press statement issued here on Monday, Dr. Mohsin Hafeez, Pakistan Country Representative for the IWMI, said, “All four of Pakistan’s provinces have been severely hit by the riverine floods and excessive rainfall in hill torrents, with some rural regions unreachable by road. We are working closely with the federal, provincial and local governments to help assess the flood damage using remote sensing and satellite imagery to support prioritization of humanitarian responses.”\n“IWMI is drawing on its experience of other flood events in India and Sri Lanka, where we have developed effective early warning systems, to help guide the government in putting together an evidence-based framework to support the recovery and relief effort”, added Dr Hafeez.\nPakistan is one of the top 10 nations most vulnerable to climate change and the worst affected provinces of Balochistan and Sindh have received 400 per cent more precipitation this year than their 30-year average, he added.\nThe unprecedented and early heatwave this year also accelerated the melting of glaciers in the Himalaya, Hindu Kush and Karakoram mountain ranges, creating thousands of glacial lakes in northern Pakistan, around 30 of which could cause a deluge.\nThe monsoon system means the catastrophe is likely to have peaked within a week to 10 days. As well as the immediate human toll and damage to water infrastructure, the extensive damage to crops and loss of livestock will also impact food security in the region, driving up prices and creating the potential for food shortages in the weeks ahead.",
