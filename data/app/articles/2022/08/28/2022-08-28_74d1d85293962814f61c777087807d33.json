  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 28 (APP): Three-day `Pakistan-Turkey-Kazakhstan Youth Forum on Biotechnology’ will be arranged in the month of September with emphasis on increasing the share of Muslim countries in the biotechnology global market.\nThe forum, to be held from September 13-15, is being sponsored by COMSTECH-the OIC Standing Committee for Scientific and Technological Cooperation, Islamic Organization for Food Security (IOFS) and Islamic Cooperation Youth Forum (ICYF), an official of COMSTECH told APP.\nThe academics, students and researchers from the OIC countries are likely to participate in the forum.The global biotechnology market is anticipated to reach a market value of US$ 775 billion by 2024 with an annual growth rate of 7.7%.\nIncreased spending on biotechnology research and development, favourable initiatives by governments, global food security and the increasing need for emerging technologies are some of the factors influencing this growth.\nUnfortunately, the share of Muslim countries in this global market of biotechnology is very small and needs to be increased.This proposed tripartite youth forum (Pakistan-Turkey-Kazakhstan) will help promote excellence and competence in the field of agricultural biotechnology among Muslim countries.\nThe theme of the forum “Agriculture Biotechnology” aims at providing the best knowledge and resources to young participants to advance their research goals, the official informed.\nThe youth forum will stimulate the desire to collaborate and change the world of agricultural biotechnology and innovation by promoting state-of-the-art practices in biotechnology research and promoting evidence-based practices.The event will include informative talks from young as well as experienced scientists from the three countries.\nThe event will also include keynote lectures, plenary sessions, oral and poster presentations, discussions and other educational and social events that stimulate several networking opportunities among the young participants of Pakistan, Turkey and Kazakhstan.\nThe official highlighted that the forum aims to facilitate interactions within the young research community to discuss the latest developments in this rapidly advancing field and find ways to respond to the increasing demands of professionals and communities across the world.\nThis youth forum is planned to be a hybrid event (Physical and virtual) depending on the preference of the participants in their submitted registration forms.\nThe topics to be covered during the forum include Genome editing and new breeding technologies, large-scale genomics and genomic selection in crop and livestock breeding, speed breeding for rapid genetic gain, variants of Cas proteins and their potential applications and high throughput phenomics.",
