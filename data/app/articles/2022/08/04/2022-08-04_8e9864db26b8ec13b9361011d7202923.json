Oppression of India cannot stop them from getting their inalienable right.’\nIt was on August 5, 2019 when Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)-backed fascist government led by the enemy of humanity Modi usurped political, social, religious other basic rights of Kashmiris and further turned the territory into a big open-air prison, said a press release.\nThe August 5 action was an attack on Kashmir’s unique identity, culture, demography and fundamental rights.\nHe urged Kashmiris all over the world to hold protest demonstrations on August 5 against Indian aggression and to draw the attention of the world towards the suffering of oppressed people of IIOJK.\nAPHC leader Ghulam Mohammad Khan Sopori termed the abrogation of special status, a “breach of promise” and “treachery” by India as well as apathy of the United Nations. APHC leaders Hilal Ahmad War and Abdul Samad Inqilabi called August 5 as a darkest day in the history of IIOJK.\n“Modi government has unleashed a reign of terror in IIOJK since 5 August 2019 by using its occupational forces,” they said and appealed the global community to intervene and stop the bloodbath in Kashmir.\n“India is hell-bent on eliminating the very existence of Muslims in IIOJK for demanding their right to self-determination,” they said.",
