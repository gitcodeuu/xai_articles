The coalition government will take the verdict to its logical conclusion.”He said for eight years, Imran Niazi used all means, fair and foul to delay the judgment.“It includes 9 petitions in IHC & over 50 adjournments. For 5 years, he willfully & knowingly submitted false affidavits. It is proven now that PTI is a foreign-aided party without any shadow of doubt.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
