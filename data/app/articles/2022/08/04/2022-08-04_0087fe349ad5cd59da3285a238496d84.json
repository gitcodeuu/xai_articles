In 2022, the Islamabad High Court (IHC) directed the government to share the list of gifts deposited in Toshakhana.\nImran Khan had bought watches of Tosha Khana worth over Rs 100 million by paying only Rs 20 million. He did not submit the details of these assets in Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in 2019.In 2022, he said when a petitioner approached the Islamabad High Court, Justice Gul Hassan, the IHC directed the concerned authorities to reveal the details of those gifts received by Toshakhana.\nDue to these facts, he and members of National Assembly including Saad Waseem and Salahuddin Ayubi filed a reference against Imran Khan to the Speaker and the speaker was Constitutionally bound to forward it to ECP within one one month period.\nMohsin Ranjha said that the ECP was bound to announce decision within 90 days as Imran Khan has also proved tax evader.",
