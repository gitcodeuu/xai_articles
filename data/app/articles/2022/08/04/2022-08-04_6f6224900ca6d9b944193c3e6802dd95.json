  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Aug 4 (APP): Minister of State for Petroleum Dr Musadik Malik on Thursday said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) was still reluctant to accept the verdict of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) despite knowing the fact that the probe into the prohibited funding case was conducted during its tenure.\n“Imran Khan was the prime minister when the State Bank of Pakistan had submitted record of his party’s financial statements to the ECP,” said Musadik while addressing a press conference here.\n“It was the PTI chief who had appointed both the governor of State Bank and the chief election commissioner,” he added.\nMusadik said the ECP verdict clearly indicated that the PTI run its affairs through ‘black money’ which had received donations/ funds from over 350 foreign based companies. All the financial records of such companies were also maintained by the PTI itself.\nThe PTI has no right to claim itself a ‘fair party’ after receiving funds from foreign nationals who had connections with enemy countries like India and Israel.\nHe said Imran of receiving ‘illegal funds’ in the guise of charity and serving foreign agenda, adding that nation can not pose confidence on such a leader who was playing in the hands of enemy powers.\nCiting the example of the book ‘The Key Man,’ written by Simon Clark, he said it had revealed all the malpractices that were made to the trustees of Shaukat Khanum Memorial Hospital in the name of charity.\n“A person [Imran] who used to tell lies to the people should not be allowed to run the affairs of the country,” adding that he might be a potential threat to national security.\nMusadik accused former prime minister Imran Khan’s government of corruption, claiming that it did not deposit millions of rupees recovered from business tycoon Malik Riaz in the United Kingdom in the national exchequer.\n“Being the custodian of the state, the former adviser’s responsibility Mirza Shahzad Akbar was originally to contest this money. But he managed the process and settled the matter against his alleged share,” said the State Minister.\nHe went on saying that Bahria Town had donated over 450 canals of land to Al-Qadir Trust. He claimed that Imran Khan and his wife Bushra Bibi were the beneficiaries of the trust that “exists only on paper”.\nImran is a “clown”, every body around him is controversial, he said adding that the PTI chief just come to power to convert his ‘black money into white money’.",
