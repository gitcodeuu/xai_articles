Indian actions have been rejected by the Kashmiris, Pakistan, and the international community.”\nHe said the dire situation in IIOJK had been taken up by the UNSC three times since 5 August 2019, reaffirming that this was an internationally recognized dispute and its solution was firmly anchored in the implementation of the relevant UNSC resolutions.India’s refusal to grant the Kashmiris’ right to self-determination had serious implications for South Asia and beyond, he added.\nHe said more than 1.5 billion people of the region deserved to see the dawn of peace and prosperity, which had been held hostage by India in IIOJK.\nLike always, Pakistan will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our Kashmiri brothers and sisters in their just struggle, he added.\n“We call upon the international community to take practical steps to hold India accountable for its gross and widespread human rights violations in IIOJK and to facilitate a peaceful resolution of this long-standing dispute.”",
