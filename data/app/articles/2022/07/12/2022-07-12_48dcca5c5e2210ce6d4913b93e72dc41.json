Thus, 22 youth sacrificed their lives till the completion of Azaan.\nKashmiris have been observing Martyrs Week from July 8 to July 13. Every year on July 8, Burhan Wani’s martyrdom anniversary is observed as ‘Resistance Day’ while July 13 as Kashmir Martyrs’ Day in memory of 22 people who fell to the bullets of Maharaja’s troops in Srinagar in 1931.\nOn the call of All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC), complete shutdown will be observed in Indian Illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK on the day whereas protest rallies, seminars and conferences would be held in Azad Kashmir, Pakistan and world over to pay tribute to the martyrs, particularly those of July 1931.
