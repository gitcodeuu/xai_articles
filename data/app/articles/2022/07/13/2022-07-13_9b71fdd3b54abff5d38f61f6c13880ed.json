Indian, however, was using every brutal method, including extrajudicial killings, arrests, torture and rape to suppress the freedom movement.\nHe said the nefarious designs of Indian occupation forces would never succeed and the Kashmiri people would ultimately get freedom.\nThe APHC leader appealed to the international community to play its due role in resolving the decades long issue as per the aspirations of Kashmiris.",
