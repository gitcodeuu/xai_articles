It accelerates the progress when it brings along equity with it. We are making our progress towards the 2030.\nThe pandemic deepened the cracks of inequality, leading several countries down the treacherous path of borrowing to salvage economic solvency, he added.\nHe said the global scenario appears bleak, with even developed countries now reeling from its after-effects. There is a dire need for home-grown solutions that are centred around the principle of sustainability and self-sufficiency.\nFully utilizing youth potential, positioning women as power-agents of economic growth and prosperity, and channeling marginalized segments of society into sustainable and community-driven social safety nets, can reduce burdens on the state and accrue overall benefits for the economy.\n“We are making a conscious effort to extensively and strategically engage stakeholders as we wanted our second VNR to be a compendium of our national and provincial undertakings, collective knowledge creation, purposeful resources’ redirection and unanimous political commitment towards advancing the SDG agenda,” he added.",
