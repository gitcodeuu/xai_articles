On the occasion, both the dignitaries also signed a Memorandum of Understanding.\nThis partnership signals the US Mission’s commitment to advance education in Pakistan by providing American resources, expertise, and collaboration for students and faculty.  In his remarks, Ambassador Blome said, “This year marks the 75th anniversary of US-Pakistan bilateral relations. The people-to-people ties between our two countries are our greatest strength.\nThe inauguration of this new Lincoln Corner will continue to advance these ties.”  He maintained that over 600 Lincoln Corners across the world connect people through technology, academic programs and publications vis-à-vis American culture, history and international relations.    In his remarks, Rector NUST appreciated the joint efforts of NUST team and Public Affairs Section of US Embassy, for timely realisation of the initiative.\nHe said Lincoln Corner is not only a multimedia resource centre with comfortable space for learning and open dialogue but also a manifestation of close linkages between NUST and the US Embassy. He further said that this facility will be used by not only students and faculty of NUST but also Pakistani civil society at large.\nRepresentatives from the US Embassy joined NUST leadership, faculty and students at the inauguration. By hosting a Lincoln Corner, NUST joins a strong network of partnerships between the US Mission in Pakistan and eminent Pakistani institutions.    Lincoln Corners are event spaces and resource centers that connect young leaders with the US.\nThe Corner will host online and in-person educational programs. It includes a Maker Space equipped with a 3-D printer and virtual reality setup, a comprehensive book and magazine collection, resources on pursuing higher education in the US, digital information resources, and an Americana-themed event space.",
