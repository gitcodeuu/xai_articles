  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi on Monday said that in order to promote sustainable and inclusive socio-economic development, the world needed to address the issues related to population, including poverty, health problems, illiteracy, and violation of human.\nThe president, in his message on World Population Day annually observed on July 11, said the resolution of population-related issues was possible by narrowing the gap between alarming disparities and biases in gender, age, origin, ethnicity, disability, class, and religion.\nHe said it was delighting that Pakistan and member countries of the United Nations were commemorating World Population Day, an annual event since 1989, to highlight the significance of population-related matters and issues.\nThe president said the theme of World Population Day 2022 “A world of 8 billion: Towards a resilient future for all – Harnessing opportunities and ensuring rights and choices for all” was pertinent as in November 2022, the world population would reach the 8 billion mark.\n“We need to work together very closely to achieve agenda 2030 by anticipating and understanding the way our population is changing. This is possible if we develop unique responses based on data to mitigate potentially negative effects to fully harness the opportunities that also come with demographic change,” the president remarked.\nHe said Pakistan had given top priority to the subject of population and its development.\nThe Council of Common Interests has approved a set of eight recommendations and the National Action Plan (NAP) in consultation with the provincial and regional governments to address the matters related to population in the country inclusively.\n“Our data suggests that almost half of the pregnancies in the country are unwanted due to the lack of access to contraceptives. The country is focusing on this issue and will be able to drastically curtail our increasing population in the short term, until demographic transition as seen throughout the world takes over,” the president commented.\nHe expressed the hope that Pakistan would take every step possible to fulfil its international commitments and implement the CCI’s recommendations and the National Action Plan on population while taking all stakeholders and implementing partners on board. “I am happy to note that provincial and regional governments, civil society organizations and the private sector have joined hands with the federal government to advance the agenda of population and development in the country,” the president added.",
