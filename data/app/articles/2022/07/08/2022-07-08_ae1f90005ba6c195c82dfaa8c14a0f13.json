The framework would be got approved by the Federal Cabinet in due course of time.\nBefore leaving the government, he said, the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) made legislation under which the Federal Government had no authority to change the gas price determined by the Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (OGRA).\nHe said the government was working out for the last two-three weeks how the gas consumers could be given relief as OGRA had informed it about the new rate which was far high as compared to the last year.\nThe minister also thanked the TNFJ leaders for extending support to the PML-N candidates in the Punjab Assembly by-polls, scheduled on July 17.",
