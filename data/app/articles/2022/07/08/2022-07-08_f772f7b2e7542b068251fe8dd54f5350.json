He stressed the need for cooperative ventures between Pakistan and Indonesia to develop bilateral trade.\nKabir said the Pakistan-Indonesia bilateral trade and economic relations can be further strengthened by the exchange of business-to-business delegations, organizing of joint trade exhibitions, and taking equal benefits from each other’s experiences.\nAmbassador Tugio further added that the first “Indonesia Corner” will be established at the University of Peshawar, with a subsequent location expected in Lahore to strengthen cultural ties and collaboration in the education sector.\nThe envoy also stated that the Indonesian Embassy, in partnership with the National Institute of Folk and Traditional Heritage (Lok Virsa), will host “A Night at Museum” cultural exhibition to showcase the confluence of civilization between Indonesia and Pakistan.\nAmbassador Tugio informed the president of the LCCI that every effort would be made to assist the business sector in fostering closer trade and economic ties.",
