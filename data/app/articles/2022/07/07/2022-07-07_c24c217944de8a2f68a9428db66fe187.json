HEC has a system in place for their capacity building, but it needs to be further strengthened and planning should also be done to include training of college teachers.\nSecondly, the world is shifting towards a system where focus is being given to skills of students therefore we also need to train our teachers and university management to plan their curricula and teaching methodology in that way,” he said.\nRana Tanveer Hussain directed HEC authorities to restart the national ranking process of universities, saying that it is an important factor to urge universities for improving their performance.\n“It is good that a few of our universities have made it to top ranked global universities but the figure is too low. I believe that ranking at national level will play a catalytic role for enhancing performance of our universities.”\nDr. Shaista Sohail, in her briefing, gave an overview of all major functions of HEC, including quality assurance, accreditation of universities and degree programmes, funding mechanism, strengthening of universities’ physical and technological infrastructure including Smart Universities and other HEC services like attestation and equivalence of degrees.\nThe Acting Chairperson HEC also described the challenges faced by HEC in execution of its policies and hoped that with the government’s support the higher education plans will be implemented smoothly.",
