Lt Col Mirza was martyred by the terrorists as they were fleeing from security forces.\nFive terrorists belonging to the banned Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) were killed during heavy exchange of fire including those who were being claimed to have been missing.\nA video footage, reportedly released by the BLA sometime back, revealed that the Baloch individuals who were being propagated as missing persons were shown fighting against and killing the security personnel in the province.\nSaleem Baloch, son of Karim Bakhsh, was one of such militants who had joined the BLA to target the security forces, while his family had declared him a missing person.\nIn such a video, Saleem Baloch is clearly visible carrying weapons and opening fires at the security personnel.\nThe video clip also shows the grave of another terrorist covered by the BLA flag.\nIn another footage, a conversation between the terrorists including Saleem Baloch is audible with an unknown person giving direction to his accomplices including one namely Bisham during an attack on security forces.\nThe unnamed individual asks Bisham to stop for half an hour who questioned whether he was being filmed.
