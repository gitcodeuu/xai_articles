  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 25 (APP): Chairman Pakistan People’s Party and Foreign Minister Bilawal Bhutto Zardari on Monday called for the formation of a Supreme Court full bench to hear the case related to the Punjab chief minister’s election.\nSpeaking at a joint press conference along with leaders of the coalition government, he said the full court bench was significant to avoid any “controversial and partial” verdict on the case.\nThe presser came ahead of the resumption of a hearing by the country’s top court on the petition of Pakistan Muslim League (Q) leader Chaudhry Parvez Elahi challenging the Punjab Assembly deputy speaker’s ruling.\nBilawal Bhutto stressed that only three judges could not decide the destiny of the nation.\n“When all judges will hear the case, no one will have any objection to the decision,” he said.\nHe pointed out that “all institutions needed to work within their own ambit”.\n“The verdict by a three-member bench will give an impression that the institutions are ‘not neutral’,” he said.\nBilawal mentioned that his party made a persistent struggle for upholding democracy in the country and rendered immense sacrifices.\n“We want the country to be run in accordance with the Constitution,” he said.\nHe criticized the government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf for wreaking havoc with the economy and stability of the country in the last four years.",
