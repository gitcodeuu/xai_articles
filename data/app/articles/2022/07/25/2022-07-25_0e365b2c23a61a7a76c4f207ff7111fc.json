We all are on one page to set the economy on the right track but let us do it.”\nResponding to a query, he said the country was facing serious economic crisis due to the previous regime’s bad governance but the coalition government saved it from bankruptcy and brought it on the road to progress.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
