  "content": "MIRPUR [AJK]: Jul 22 (APP): The tragic incidents of pre-planned grilling of innocent Kashmiris by the Indian government in thousands of fake cases by occupational forces in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu Kashmir (IIOJK) was being increased since the last many years.\nOne of the worst examples of the reign of state terrorism is the victimization of his own fraction of Jammu Kashmir Liberation Front (R) Farooq Dar, resident of Srinagar, currently languishing in New Delhi’s notorious Tihar jail for the past over six years, said a report reaching here Friday from across the Line of Control (LoC).\nUnveiling the details of ill-fated Farooq, the report continued as saying “India detained Mohammad Farooq S/O Ghulam Rasool Prisoner ID No: 1042099 Chairman JKLF ( R ) in case Hafeez Mohammad Saeed and others in FIR No: RC /10/2017/NIA/DLI U/Section 120 B, 121, 121 A & 124 A OF Indian Penal Code (IPC ) & section 13, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 39 & 40 of UAPA 1967 PS NIA Delhi”.\nThe FIR was registered by NIA on 30th May, 2018. Farooq was called to Delhi by NIA and arrested on 24th July 2017 without informing the family about the whereabouts.\nThe date of FIR & the date of arrest shows a pre planned conspiracy of the Government of India. They were trying to persuade Mohammad Farooq to join mainstream politics by pressure tactics and when he refused to budge he was arrested on 24th July, 2017.\nHe has completed 5 years in Tihar central Jail No: 2. Government of India is not granting bail since February, 2018 and PMO office is trying to use the case for electoral politics to win votes across India. More Torture of Kashmiris means more Hindu Vote Bank.\nThis is not the first time. Earlier also Mohammad Farooq was detained by the Government of India in June 1990 and 24 fake cases were slapped against him. He served a jail term of continuous detention from June 1990 till October 2006 in various jails across India including Amphala Jail, Kot Bhalwal, Kathua Jail, Hira Nagar, Agra Jail, Jodhpur, Tihar to name a few.\nFrom running rollers on his right leg, to putting a black cloth continuously on his eyes for continuous six months and keeping him in solitary confinement to gunning down his brother in 1998 Government of India has tried every method to pressurize him to bring him to mainstream but much to the dismay of Government of India the man continues to champion cause of Freedom.\nThe latest pressure tactic was to potray him as a villain in the Islamophobic Movie The Kashmir Files.\nThe International Red Cross has documented meeting Farooq Sb 31 times in various jails across India. It is on their records in ICRC Headquarters in Holland as well. ICRC terms him the longest serving Kashmiri detainee in the Indian Jail.\nHe has been detained for one complete year in 2008 in Srinagar’s Central Jail in the year 2008 along with Salim Nanaji another JKLF leader.\nIn 2017 almost 500,000 Kashmiri Pandits gathered outside Hon’ble Supreme Court of India under the aegis of Highly Rightwing Communal Organization called Roots in Kashmir run by people like Arnab Goswami, Aditya Raj Kaul, Sandeep Mawa & Sushil Pandit who wanted to go for reopening of cases in Hon’ble Supreme Court of India.\nThe Supreme Court Coram of Chief Justice of India and Justice Chandrachud dismissed the Petition on 24th July, 2017 on the following Observation : “We have heard learned Counsel for the petitioner at some length. We , however, decline to entertain this petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India, for the simple reason that the instances referred to in the present petition pertain to the year 1989-90, and more than 27 years have passed by since then. No fruitful purpose would emerge, as evidence is unlikely to be available at this late juncture. The instant petition under Article 32 of the Constitution of India is accordingly dismissed.”\nRoots in Kashmir filed another petition on 2th October,2017 and Coram of Chief Justice Mr. Deepak Mishra and justice Chandrachud again dismissed the petition citing the order that we have carefully gone through the Review petition and the connected papers, but we see no reason to interfere with the order impugned.\nThe question is why is Government of India not allowing bail since 2017 even when Ho’ble Supreme Court has dismissed the petitions against him. Are they pointing fingers their own judiciary. NIA Act has been Given Impunity under NIA Act.\nDoes that mean there is no Justice system for Kashmiris.\nJustice Murlidharan in 41 page judgment said the NIA case stands no merit. Then why are Kashmiris languishing in Indian Jails ? It is a political case of Delhi Versus Kashmir where courts, NIA, Armed Forces, groups like RIK are used by State to carry on with its Venomous Right Wing Hindutva agenda”, the report concluded.",
