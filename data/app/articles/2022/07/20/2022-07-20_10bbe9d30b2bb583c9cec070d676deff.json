Efforts were being made to curtail imports and increase exports, he added.\nTo another question about oil products, the minister said that a friendly country was trying to support Pakistan in that regard.\nTo a query, he said that a temporary set up could not address the challenges confronting the nation. The PML-N government was fully capable to steer the country out of crises and the party would win the next elections on the basis of performance, he added.",
