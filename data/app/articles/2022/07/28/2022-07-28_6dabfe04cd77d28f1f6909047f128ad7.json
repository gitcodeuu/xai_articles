  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 28 (APP): World Health Organization (WHO) on Thursday said that it should be ensured that all eligibles are tested viral hepatitis in view of treatment.\nOn the occasion of World Hepatitis Day, the WHO said that this year the day was observed with theme ‘Bring hepatitis care closer’.\nIt stressed the need to decentralize essential hepatitis services, deliver them in an integrated manner, bring hepatitis care closer to those who need it and engage communities and patient groups to expand access in Pakistan.\nThe WHO said that it was looking forward for decentralization of essential hepatitis services and its delivery closer to communities and people to expand access in Pakistan.\nViral hepatitis affects 360 million people worldwide and claims 3000 lives every day.In 2015, the World Health Assembly adopted a strategy to eliminate hepatitis by 2030 through prevention, testing and treatment.\nWorld Hepatitis Day, commemorated annually on 28 July, reminds us of our commitment to eliminate viral hepatitis as a public health threat by 2030. The strategy is fully aligned with WHO’s vision of “Health for All, by All” in the Eastern Mediterranean Region.\nPakistan is facing a considerable high disease burden due to Viral Hepatitis B and C.\nIt has higher prevalence of Hepatitis C (7%) globally and considerable number of people suffering from HCV. Around 15 million people are estimated infected with Viral Hepatitis C and another five million are estimated infected with Viral Hepatitis B, in the country.\nThe theme of world hepatitis day this year aims to raise awareness about the need to simplify and bring hepatitis care to primary health care facilities, community-based venues and locations beyond hospital sites, so that heath care is closer to communities and people wherever they are.\nPrimary health care is an essential pillar of universal health coverage, and hepatitis services, including testing, treatment and prevention, need to be integrated within it.Bringing hepatitis care closer to communities will secure prevention services for those at higher risk for hepatitis.\nThe WHO said that Hepatitis B vaccines should be provided to all newborns within 24 hours of birth as part of neonatal care and mothers should be tested early in their pregnancies to prevent transmission of hepatitis to their babies.",
