The need is to expedite climate financing for the project and design top priority interventions with the support of the Cabinet and the provinces. These priorities can be undertaken in phases.”\nFederal Minister underscored the importance of the project and thanked Julien for his continued efforts in supporting Pakistan’s climate initiatives.",
