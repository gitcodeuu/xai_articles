  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 31 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb said on Sunday that another attempt of former prime minister Imran Khan’s spouse Bushra Bibi, directing “Arsalan Beta” for linking political opponents to treason, had been exposed.\nIn a statement, the minister said that both versions of the video, the original one and the one produced by Bushra Bibi were being presented here.\nBushra made the video and released it to the media on July 30 at 4:28 pm, the minister said, adding that the original video was also available with ARY News.\nThe minister said the video had been sent to the FIA Cyber Crime Wing so that those, who edited the video and added voices to it, could be brought to justice.\nMarriyum accused that the management of ARY news channel should also be ashamed of becoming part of Imran Khan’s agenda of spreading lies under the guise of journalism and freedom of speech to divert attention from his corruption. The said news channel always killed the truth and reality.\nTaking a jibe at the ARY, she said, “When illegal contracts worth billions of rupees are being received, then lies will surely be propagated in the guise of journalism.”\nThis lowly and vile act of Imran was an expression of his mindset, who did not hesitate in telling lies habitually about the sacred concept of Riyasat-e- Madinah, as well as about FATF, corona pandemic, flood, religion, health of political opponents, economy and employment of people.\nThe minister reminded that bodies of tourists were lying under the snow in Murree, but Bushra Bibi did not allow his husband and the then PM to pay a visit to the site, and he chose to go on a tour to the mountains instead.\nNow, it disturbed Imran’s stomach watching Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif helping people in their difficulties, she said, adding that Imran must be questioning himself in pain that “why does he [Shehbaz Sharif] go to them, why does he sympathize with them?”\nShe recalled that Hazara community had been awaiting Imran Khan with bodies of their loved ones lying on road while he, instead of consoling them, accused them of blackmailing him.\nNaeemul Haque and many of his closest friends died, but Imran was not allowed to attend thier funerals, she said.\nMarriyum Aurangzeb said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) had the worst floods and dengue outbreak, but shameless and insensitive Imran paid no attention and continued playing Ludo in the Chief Minister’s House.\nInstead of helping flood victims in KP, Balochistan, Sindh and Punjab, Imran and Bushra were busy editing and fabricating the video of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, which the minister said was highly lamentable.\nCriticising Imran Khan, she said he was the one who needed “camera, action and ARY’s light,” not Shehbaz Sharif.",
