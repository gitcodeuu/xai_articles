  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP): Minister for Water Resources and Pakistan Peoples Party’s Veteran Leader Syed Khursheed Ahmed Shah on Sunday evening said it was true democracy to accept election results with an open heart.\nReferring to the results of by-polls in Punjab, he said, “Pakistan has to move forward and the democratic system has to continue.”\nKhursheed Shah said the election results were proof of that it was the only way forward in politics. Political parties should give up protest and violent politics forever, he added.\nHe said Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz would also get a chance to improve itself.\nHe proposed Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Chief Imran Khan not to repeat his mistakes anymore in future.\nKhursheed Shah said victory and defeat were not important in politics but democratic attitudes were important.\nHe said the chief election commissioner (CEC) continued to discharge his professional obligations while enduring severe criticism and personal attacks.\nThe CEC deserved to be congratulated for conducting fair and transparent elections, he added.\nHe expressed the hope that the CEC would perform the same responsibility in the general elections as well.",
