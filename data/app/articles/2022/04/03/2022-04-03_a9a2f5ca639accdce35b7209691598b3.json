It’s a time to reflect on the values of compassion, charity and selflessness, she added.\nPakistan has a rich tradition of celebrating religious and cultural festivals, bringing together neighbors, friends, and colleagues with warm hospitality, which everyone, including many Australians visiting Pakistan during the Australia-Pakistan cricket series, has experienced.\nThis Ramazan, “I want to highlight the valuable contributions that Australian Muslims, including many Pakistanis, make to Australian society. Australia is home to more than 600,000 Muslims from all over the world, including more than 80,000 Pakistanis”, she added. Our people-to-people links continue to strengthen the longstanding friendship between Australia and Pakistan.",
