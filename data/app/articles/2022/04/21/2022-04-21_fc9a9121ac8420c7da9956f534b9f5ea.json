She would obviously inform her party, the Congress and the Biden administration, besides raising the issue on other forums, she added.\n“We held a communication on the Foreign Affairs Committee about human rights violations and anti-Muslim acts of (the) Narendera Modi government and I believe it is not being talked about to the extent it needs to be,” Ms Omar added.\nShe said she was optimistic that more conversation would be held in the Congress on the question of Kashmir and anti-Muslim acts of the Indian government on her return (to the US) and she would be able to get issued condemnations by the US administration and raising the issue with India.\nEarlier, AJK President Barrister Sultan Mehmood briefed the Congresswoman about the human rights abuses being committed by the Indian government in the IIOJK and expressed the optimism that the Biden administration would take a cognizance of the post August 5, 2019 acts.\nShe also visited refugee camps in the AJK’s capital to assess the situation in IIOJK as these camps house the people displaced from the Indian side of Jammu and Kashmir due to Indian atrocities.",
