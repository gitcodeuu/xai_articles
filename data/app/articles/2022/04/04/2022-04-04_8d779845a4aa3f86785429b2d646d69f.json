It was better to lose than emerge triumphant with such ‘turn coats’.\nHe said the recent issue of purchase of loyalties of the members of the parliament by the opposition, the democratic values in the country had been marred.\nThe prime minister informed that tonight along with his party leaders and workers, he would participate in a protest procession outside the Red Zone in Islamabad to register protest against the opposition for playing part in the foreign conspiracy.\nHe said that he had complete confidence in the nation to reject those elements who had sold out their loyalties for their petty personal interests.\nThe prime minister urged the people to hold peaceful demonstrations against such shabby tactics of horse-trading. The letter which was shared in the National Security Committee and a parliamentary committee was a clear evidence, which also proved the opposition’s role in the foreign planned conspiracy to topple the government through a vote of no confidence.\nHe said the speaker had rejected their vote of no confidence on such basis, adding that he wanted everyone to hold protest so that the parliamentarians and political parties should have fears of public reaction and they should budge from indulgence into such acts.\nThe prime minister further urged the people to stand with virtue and negate vices by resisting the dacoits and thieves.\nHe said the opposition had fears that if the PTI government completed its tenure, their political gimmickry would end forever like in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where in the second phase of local government elections, people had voted for the PTI, eliminating all other political parties.\nThe prime minister said for the last thirty years, the opposition leaders had been ruling the country and turned the country into beggars.\nReferring to PML-N leader Shahabaz Sharif’s comments over ‘beggars not choosers’ the prime minister said such leaders had turned the nation into beggars by serving the foreign agenda and securing their personal interests.\nThe prime minister said that he wanted to make it clear that he had never been against any country. He opposed the US-led war in Afghanistan, but he had never been anti-US.\nHe further said that he wanted good relations with all the countries based on mutual respect, adding that he would not accept any policies which were against the interests of the people of Pakistan. “Death is better than such servitude,” he maintained.\nThe prime minister said that it was an insult to the whole country when a ruler of 220 million people held talks with the president of a powerful country by holding a paper in his hand.\nHe said Quaid-e-Azam had been a leader who was respected by all his opponents due to towering qualities of his character.\nThe prime minister criticized the performance of the Sindh government by terming it as ‘worst’ because it had failed to alleviate poverty and unemployment in the province.\nHe regretted that Karachi had been lagging behind in terms of progress and development.\nThe prime minister proposed for introduction of modern local and city government systems for the megacities so that they could generate their own revenues and overcome their issues.\nThe prime minister also cited the major achievements of his government on the economic front, including the highest growth rate, increase in exports, booming of textile and construction industries, highest remittances, tax and wealth collection.\nHe also appreciated the performance of former chief minister of Punjab Usman Buzdar for his tireless efforts to develop the province.\nThe prime minister said the facility of Sehat cards had been the biggest relief for the poor families.",
