Such elements did not deserve to be at holy places as it could cause religious disharmony here.\nHe said the former prime minister Imran Khan was also targeting institutions for this purpose.\nHe said Imran Khan would have to answer people for his bad governance during the last four years.\nThe minister said that Imran Niazi was staging various dramas aimed at safeguarding himself for possible several corruption scandals.\nHe said National Accountability Bureau (NAB) had ordered a reference against Farrah Khan- a front woman of Imran Khan.\nHe said the entire nation stood with judiciary and Chief Elections Commissioner.
