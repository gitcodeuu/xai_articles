Pakistan also joins the voices for justice and condemns the oppression of the Palestinian people, he added.\nThe prime minister urged the international community to ensure the implementation of the UN Security Council resolutions and agreements on the two-state solution.\nHe viewed that the enforcement of the UN Security Council resolutions against the illegal occupation of Jammu and Kashmir and Palestine by India and Israel respectively could bring about a durable peace in the region.\nThe prime minister also paid tribute the martyrs of the Kashmir and Palestine movements and prayed for the success of their decades old struggle.",
