  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 2 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan Saturday here said legislators of Pakistan Tehreek I Insaf (PTI) would go to the National Assembly on Sunday during the proceedings of the no confidence motion against him to give a surprise to the opposition parties.\nTalking to legislators of his party at a dinner hosted by him, he said support for him started to increase after Pakistanis came to know about the conspiracy being hatched by the opposition leaders in collusion with the United States.He said Americans wanted to bring the opposition in power and they wanted to enslave the Pakistani nation with the use of money.He said he was confident about the outcome of the no confidence motion against him and he could not imagine he could lose power.It was unfortunate that some politicians sold their conscience and people now knew about their faces circulating on the social media, he remarked.Imran Khan paid tribute to those who stood loyal to him despite the offers of money, adding he never was an anti America person and wanted good relations with all countries.He said opposition always wanted that he should give NRO to its leaders and after every few months tried to create instability in the country to save their wealth.He said members from Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz) were now contacting him, adding opposition consisted of thieves which looted the country for the last thirty years.He noted that Pakistan Tehreek I Insaf (PTI) swept the local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Pakistan Peoples Party and Pakistan Muslim League(N) heavily lost the electoral contest.Speaking on the occasion, Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi said people were with Prime Minister Imran Khan, adding those legislators which were still with the prime minister were the assets of the party and would again make him the prime minister.He said these legislators were the guardians of the ideology of Naya Pakistan and would defeat those forces which were thinking that they had power and resources to achieve their goals.Meanwhile in an interview with a private television, the Prime Minister said he had asked people to come out on the roads on Sunday against the traitors and thieves, adding he was happy that he did not have to see the faces of the traitors again.He further said leader of the opposition Shehbaz Sharif was sending a message that he was loyal to the United States.Some people became part of the conspiracy unintentionally, he said adding after the local government elections in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the dissident politicians were now concerned about political future in their constituencies.Talking about the international conspiracy against him, he said during an official meeting the United States official told Pakistani envoy that the US relations with Pakistan would only improve if Imran Khan was removed from power.To a question, he said the issue of foreign letter was not made public earlier because of the session of the Council of Foreign Ministers of Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), adding it was honour for Pakistan that two meetings of OIC were held in Pakistan in recent months.Talking about the options available to him in the present political scenario, he said there was no option but to hold early elections in the current environment.He recalled that he removed 20 persons of his party in 2018 for selling their votes in the Senate elections.He said Pakistan was going through a defining moment, addingthe foreign conspiracy against him was proved through the official document put before the National Security Committee.To another question, he said the last government left the current account deficit of $ 20 billion and the economy was in dire situation when he assumed power.He said he would fight till the last ball during the no confidence motion and Shehbaz Sharif would not succeed in becoming the prime minister.He said Pakistan was the fifth largest country and no other country should try to dictate its foreign policy.Nawaz Sharif met Hussain Haqqani who talked against Pakistan army, he told.He regretted that he allowed Nawaz Sharif to leave the country on medical grounds and gave tickets to traditional politicians in 2018 elections.Nawaz Sharif would only come back to the country if he thought that courts would end his cases, he commented.He said Pervaiz Elahi was a better candidate for the office of Chief Minister.He said Pakistan needed army as an institution to secure its territorial integrity.While discussing his visit to Russia, Imran Khan said he was looking to buy wheat and gas from Russia to meet the country’s needs.He mentioned that the foreign powers did not stop India from trading with Russia and did not object to the relations of the two countries but objected to his visit to Russia.He said people were with Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf as the party stood for the dignity of Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
