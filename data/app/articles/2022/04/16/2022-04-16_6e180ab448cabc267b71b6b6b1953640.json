The\ncall for early elections was the highest in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where 78% wanted early elections. In Sindh 68% desired  early elections, while in Punjab 65% respondents said they were also in favour of early polls.\nThe Gallup Pakistan said the sample size was small in Balochistan hence disaggregation of result of the province was not statistically significant and therefore not reported.",
