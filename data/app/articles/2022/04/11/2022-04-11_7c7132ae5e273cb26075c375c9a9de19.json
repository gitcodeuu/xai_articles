It is during this stage that the foundations are laid for a healthy and successful adult life.”\nThe formative lived experiences of street children, she said, could make or break their personalities, ultimately affecting the society as a whole. It was time to take action so that street children were no longer invisible. “We must make efforts to provide them inclusive, quality education for all, health care, and nutrition programmes,” she stressed.\nMs Afshan Tehseen said,”The Commission recommends that the government develop models and strategies for prevention, response and rehabilitation to keep children from ending up on the streets. There is a need to develop a multi-sectoral, holistic national strategy for street children that addresses education and protection across Pakistan.\n“Improving the situation of street children in Pakistan is a collective responsibility that requires a coordinated response from government agencies and civil society organizations.\nShe said the street children were a major social problem in Pakistan.\nThe Commission, in collaboration with Cities for Children, she said, had undertaken a study to improve understanding of the phenomenon of street children in Pakistan. “The study provides policy makers and civil society with an overview of the situation of street children in Pakistan and makes recommendations to facilitate informed decisions for initiating system-wide changes to protect them.”\nThe study, she added, would be launched in Islamabad on April 20.",
