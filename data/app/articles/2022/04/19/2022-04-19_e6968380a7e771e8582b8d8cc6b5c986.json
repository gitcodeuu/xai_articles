  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 19 (APP): Federal Minister for Planning Development and Special Initiatives Ahsan Iqbal on Tuesday said the new coalition government would actively engage China to speed up various projects under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).\nThe government’s top priority was to strengthen the country’s economy as it was the only pre-requisite for its sovereignty, he said while talking to the media during his visit to National Center for Artificial Intelligence here at the National University of Science and Technology (NUST).\nThe minister said he inaugurated the Center in 2018 to prepare the youth to use to the latest technologies. The artificial intelligence, automatic robotics, big data cloud, cyber security and applied mathematics were the driver sectors of the fourth generation industrial revolution, and the youth could apply their skills in the those sectors globally, he added.\nIn next few years, he said “we will train some 100,000 youth in these skills so that they can become part of the global digital intelligence.”\nHe said it was unfortunate that the Higher Education Commission (HEC) was neglected during the previous government. He expressed the resolve to restore the Commission’s autonomy, along with its funding.\nReplying to a question, the minister said although the coalition government had not a full term of five years, yet it still was a big blessing as it would be easy to build consensus over national reforms.\nHe said soon after the coalition government took the charge, the country’s stock exchange showed a positive response while the value of Pak rupee also strengthened against the US dollar.\nAhsan Iqbal said as all parties of Balochistan were part of the government, it was a big opportunity that the long standing issues of the province should be resolved amicably.\nResponding to another question, the minister said the government had formed a committee in the Parliament to start the electoral reforms’ process.\n“First we will make it sure that the electoral reforms are done and then we will think upon the new elections,” he said while responding to another query.\nHe said this was a constitutional requirement to complete the delimitation process and for that the Election Commission of Pakistan required around 6 to 7 months.",
