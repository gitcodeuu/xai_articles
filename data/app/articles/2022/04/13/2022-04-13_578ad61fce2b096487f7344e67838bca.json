The PTCL’s financial results for the first quarter ended on March 31, 2022 was announced at its Board of Directors’ meeting held here on Wednesday, said a news release.\nGrowth in revenue was mainly driven by strong performance in the consumer segment led by Fixed Broadband, Mobile Data, Business Solutions, and Microfinance services.

Likewise, the PTCL’s revenue of Rs 19.6 billion for the quarter was 3.5 per cent higher than the quarter one of 2021, mainly driven by growth in Broadband and Corporate revenue segments.\nMoreover, the PTML’s (Ufone) revenue grew by 1 per cent in the same period. U Bank had also continued its growth momentum and achieved a growth of 13 per cent in its quarterly revenue over the same period of last year.  The company had posted an operating profit of Rs 1 billion for the quarter.\nOperating profit for the period remained under pressure compared to last year mainly due to increase in operating costs on account of significant hike in power tariffs.  Net Profit of Rs 1.9 billion for the quarter was 10 per cent higher as compared to the same period of last year.\nIncrease in non-operating income, due to translation gain on the Company’s forex denominated assets, dividend income from a subsidiary and gain on disposal of obsolete assets due to upgrade and fiberization of network, had helped turn 39 per cent decrease at operating profit level to a 10 per cent increase at the net profit level.  During the past quarters, the PTCL mainly focused on enhancing customer experience by providing the fastest and most reliable internet services under its flagship ‘Flash Fiber’ Fiber-To-The-Home (FTTH) brand.\nThrough an aggressive and robust commercial strategy, PTCL managed to expand its FTTH services in 27 cities with capacity enhancement for 125,000 new lines during the past year.

Within the wholesale business segment, carrier revenue grew by 6.6 per cent, but the overall wholesale segment revenue had declined as a result of closure of certain international IP leased circuits.
