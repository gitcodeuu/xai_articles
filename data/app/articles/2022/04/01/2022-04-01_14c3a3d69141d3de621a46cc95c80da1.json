  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 01 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain Friday announced to file a petition in the court for the cancellation of PML-N President Shehbaz Sharif’s bail in a corruption case.\nBoth Shehbaz Sharif and his son Hamza Shehbaz, who were on bail in the corruption cases, were looking for the slots of prime minister and Punjab chief minister, he said while talking to the media.\n“I was just told that the law ministry’s charge is being given to me… I, at once, will ask for filing petitions for the cancellation of bail of both Shehbaz and Hamza,” he added.\nFlanked with Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar, he said the government would ask the court to start proceedings for the cancellation of their bails.\nPrime Minister Imran Khan, he said, would complete his constitutional term. The nation would not let any foreign power to change regime in the country.\nThe minister said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leadership had taken strict note of its dissident Members of National Assembly’s (MNAs) meeting with the opposition parties.\nThe legal team had finalized its action plan regarding the dissident MNAs, he added. It would plead before the apex court that the matter of no-trust motion should be looked into as being a part of an international conspiracy.\nIt was beyond one’s understanding as to how the conscience of 22 PTI MNAs awakened all of a sudden, he remarked.\nThe minister said some members of the allied parties of government were invited to attend the special meeting of Federal Cabinet where the content of the “threat letter” was shared, but they refused.\nLikewise, he said, Leader of the Opposition Shehbaz Sharif was also asked to attend a meeting so that he, himself, could see the evidences of the foreign plot, but he also refused. He did not come to the meeting as he already knew of the conspiracy.\nThe minister accused the leaders of main opposition parties of being part of the international conspiracy against the democratically elected government.\nReferring to the three PML-N leaders who held a press conference over the prime minister’s address to the nation the other day, he said they had no right to talk about the foreign policy.\nOne of the PML-N leaders, Khawaja Asif, held “Iqamas” of other countries while being a cabinet member in the Nawaz Sharif-led government, he recalled.\nFawad paid tribute to the people who held protests against the sell-outs. “Those who have taken part in those protest are our heroes,” he added.\nFederal Minister for Energy Hammad Azhar, on the occasion, claimed that some foreign powers were trying to install a puppet government in Pakistan to achieve their nefarious designs.\nHe also highlighted the economic achievements made by the PTI government during last three and a half years, saying the country was moving on the road of progress and development.\nThe incumbent government had achieved economic growth rate of 5.5%, he added.\nDue to the policies of PTI government, the minister said, all the international agencies had upgraded Pakistan’s ranking. “Record loans, taken by the previous regimes, have been paid by our government,” he added.\nHe also criticized the agreements signed by the PML-N government with the Independent Power Producers and said the PTI government had re-negotiated them for the benefit of the country.\nHe expressed the hope that Pakistan would exit from the grey list of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) as it had already met all the conditions.\n“We have met 32 conditions out of 34,” the minister said.",
