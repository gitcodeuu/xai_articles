There is also a flexibility to add new departments and treatment packages requested by empaneled hospitals.\nCurrently, the Tahafuz has partnered with 14 public sector hospitals across all seven federating units and covers “out of pocket expenditures” associated with pre-approved treatment packages.\nEmpaneled hospitals across Pakistan include Capital Hospital in Islamabad Capital Territory; Holy Family Hospital Rawalpindi, Nishtar Medical University and Hospital Multan, Children Hospital and Institute of Child Health Multan in Punjab; Lady Reading Hospital Peshawar, Khyber Teaching Hospital Peshawar, Hayatabad Medical Complex Peshawar and District Headquarter Hospital Dera Ismail Khan in KP; Shaikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan Hospital Quetta and Shaheed Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto Hospital Quetta in Balochistan; Gambat Institute of Medical Sciences in Sindh; Regional Headquarter Hospital and Provincial Headquarter Hospital in Gilgit and Abbas Institute of Medical Sciences in AJK.\nAccording to the criteria given on Ehsaas Tahafuz portal, the tertiary care public hospitals able to perform treatment for Tahafuz approved conditions can express interest in partnering with Tahafuz.\nHospital signs and submits Expression of Interest along with basic hospital information by filling the registration form.
