The parliamentarians should take a stand against the conspiracy, which was in fact against the sovereignty of Pakistan.\nThe timing of the threatening document, he said, showed its link with the no-confidence motion tabled by the opposition in the National Assembly. The change of regime in Pakistan was clearly mentioned in the document.\nSenator Faisal said Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi become Punjab chief minister by getting the confidence of provincial assembly members.\nHe said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf would win the next general elections in 2023.",
