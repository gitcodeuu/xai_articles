  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 28 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb on Thursday without naming Imran Khan said that he had destroyed values of society which could be seen from the behaviour of his party workers.\nTalking to media, she said she did not want to name that person (Imran) on this holy land, who had poisoned the minds of his party workers.\nShe said she does not want to use the holy land for politics but such behaviour indicated the deterioration of the whole society.\nHowever, she said there were many sections of the society which were still maintaining those traditions.\nShe hoped that it would take some time to change this negative attitude.\nShe said PML-N workers were also present in Saudi Arabia but they were asked not to adopt such attitude.",
