However, both the leaders failed to reach a consensus.\nAccording to Constitution, in case the two leaders cannot reach the consensus over one name within three days, each one of them will send two names to the eight-member parliamentary committee, comprising National Assembly and Senate members, with equal representation from the government and opposition, formed by the NA speaker.\nAsad Qaisar cited Article 224A (1) of the Constitution in the letter which says “In case the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition in the outgoing National Assembly do not agree on any person to be appointed as the caretaker prime minister, within three days of the dissolution of the National Assembly, they shall forward two nominees each to a Committee to be immediately constituted by the Speaker of the National Assembly, comprising eight members of the outgoing National Assembly, or the Senate, or both, having equal representation from the Treasury and the Opposition, to be nominated by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, respectively.”\nPM Imran Khan and Shehbaz Sharif will now nominate four members each from from the treasury and the the opposition benches respectively.
