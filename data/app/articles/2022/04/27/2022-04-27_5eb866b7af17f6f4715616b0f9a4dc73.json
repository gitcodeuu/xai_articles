The Standing Committee should formulate rules and regulations regarding the quality of law colleges in the country, he added.\nA three-member SC bench comprising Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, Justice Ijaz Ul Ahsan and Justice Syed Mansoor Ali shah heard the case regarding mushroom growth of law colleges in the country. Advocate Zafar Iqbal and others had approached the Supreme Court regarding the number of law colleges and substandard education.\nDuring the course of proceedings, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial remarked that the Supreme Court could not issue an order in every minor administrative matter, it was a time of specialization and transparency, a painstaking and impartial committee should decide on the number and quality of law colleges.\nHe said that the law minister should help in setting up the committee in consultation with the bar councils. Law colleges built in small rooms would not be allowed to function, he added.\nPresident Supreme Court Bar Association Ahsan Bhoon said that he would personally consult the Federal Minister for Law on the matter. He said that criticism against judiciary was everywhere in the society but the court had patiently endured the pain.\nOn this occasion, Chief Justice Umar Ata Bandial, while addressing Ahsan Bhoon, remarked that while someone was part of the system, some people were supporting and some were against.
