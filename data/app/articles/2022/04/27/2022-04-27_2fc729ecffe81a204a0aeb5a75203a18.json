NAB prosecutor said that the accused had been indicted in the reference and the court had testified three witnesses in the case.\nThe chief justice remarked that the reference of NAB was basically a challan. The reference was supposed to be filed after the completion of investigation, he said, adding that the trial should be completed within 30 days under the law.\nThe NAB said that the reference had alleged Ahsan Iqbal for misuse of his powers in Narowal Sports City Complex project. The chief justice asked the NAB prosecutor to tell how a reference is prepared in light of this court’s verdict in Masood Chishti case, adding that the court would accept the acquittal plea if the bureau failed to answer.\nFederal Minister Ahsan Iqbal arrived at the rostrum and adopted the stance that he had offered the NAB to prove increase in his assets after he joined the politics.
