  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Apr 27 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Marriyum Aurangzeb Wednesday said former prime minister Imran Khan had been harping on the so-called “conspiracy letter” in order to cover up his “nil performance” in four-year rule.\n“He has been waving the conspiracy paper as he has nothing on his credit on account of his government’s performance,” she told a media briefing about cabinet meeting.\nShe said Imran Khan had been telling lies persistently, but the people of Pakistan would pay any heed to them and rather oust him from politics forever.\nImran Khan, she added, himself was perturbed over the popularity of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif who would make the lives of people easy through his sheer commitment to the service of the nation.\nShe said Imran Khan still considered himself in government. For negative economic growth rate, Imran should have tendered his resignation, but he instead asked the Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) to quit.\nShe said the politics of Imran Khan would not last long as the coalition government had already started performing excellently, with the prices of essential items coming down.\nThe Metro Bus project from Peshawar Mor to the new Islamabad Airport remained dysfunctional for the last four years, but it was activated by PM Shehbaz Sharf within four days of taking oath of office, she added.\nThe minister said instead of threatening the Election Commission of Pakistan, Imran should better answer the public questions about the shortage of power, and increase in sugar, flour and other items’ prices.\nShe said Imran Khan had framed cases the leading politicians but not a single one had been proved in any court of law so far. He would have to answer for his failure to recover the stolen money despite the best efforts of his so-called Asset Recovery Unit headed by Shahzad Akbar.\nHe had made the people’s lives miserable by increasing prices of essential items, she remarked.\nMarriyum said PM Shehbaz Sharif desired to review the National Action Plan (NAP). For the purpose, he had directed to summon the meeting of National Counter Terrorism Authority (NECTA) immediately. He directed the Interior Ministry to review NAP in collaboration with all the provinces and NECTA, and devise a comprehensive plan to curb terrorism, she added.\nFormer prime minister Nawaz Sharif had restored peace in the country and the incumbent government would further strengthen it, she added.\nThe minister said the cabinet directed to review the Civil Servants (Directory Retirement from Service) Rules. The aim of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf government was to target officers. The cabinet decided to review all such laws framed for peculiar purpose.\nA committee comprising federal ministers Azam Nazir Tarrar, Ms Sherry Rehman and Saad Rafique was constituted to review the service rules, and present the report in two weeks, she added.\nThe Power Division and Petroleum Division officials briefed the cabinet about the latest situation of power and diesel in the country. It was was told that 27 power plants were closed when the incumbent government assumed charge.\nWithin two weeks the situation improved much as only seven power units were closed right now. Repairing of the power plants continued and load-shedding would end by next month.\nThe minister blamed the last PTI government for increased load shedding and power outages. As the closed power units were being repaired, the load-shedding would be eliminated by next month.\nShe said Imran Khan was imposed on the country after the 2018 elections. He had victimized his political opponents, and the country today was facing problems due to his incompetence.\nImran Khan, she added, had failed to explain anomalies in his party’s foreign funding.\nBlaming Imran Khan for selling Kashmir, increasing prices of sugar, electricity and gas’ and shortage of electricity in the country during his tenure, she said Imran also victimized journalists and made them jobless.\nShe said the 75th anniversary of Pakistan’s independence would be celebrated in a befitting manner.\nTo a question, the minister said the last government had inducted its workers in various departments. Law would take its due course against the looters and plunderers.\nThe coalition government believed in freedom of expression and would work for the welfare of the journalists community, she added.\nThe federal cabinet approved appointment of Asim Ahmed as Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Chairman and directed EOBI Chairman Shakrain Mangrio to to report the Establishment Division.\nIt also condemned the suicide blast in Karachi and decided to review the overall security situation in the country. It directed to ensure fool proof security of the Chinese nationals working in Pakistan. The Chinese Embassy was assured that investigations into the suicide blast would be completed.",
