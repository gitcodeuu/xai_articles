Under the system, minorities’ representatives were selected by the heads of political parties, not by the minority community members.\nThe system had introduced political corruption, nepotism and favoritism, he added.\nMAP’s central committee members, Shamaoun Gill, Anosh Bhatti, Aftab Khuram, Sadaf Adnan and Asif John also spoke on the occasion.",
