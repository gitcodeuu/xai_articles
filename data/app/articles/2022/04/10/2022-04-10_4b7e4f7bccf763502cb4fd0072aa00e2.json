  "content": "Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) President Shehbaz Sharif on Sunday vowed to transform the country according to the vision of founder of Pakistan Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah, ensuring rule of law and justice in the society.\n“We will not be revengeful. We will not do injustice to anyone. We will not put the innocent people in jails, but the law will take its course,” he said in his victory speech after ousting the PTI government through a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nHe said there would be no interference in dispensation of justice as the allied parties had great respect for the judiciary.\nHe recalled that opposition leaders including PML-N Quaid Nawaz Sharif faced jails, adding  that he did not want to be stuck up in the  bitterness of past and rather “we want to move forward and make Pakistan a great nation, forgetting the past bitterness.”\nShehbaz also expressed resolve to mitigate sufferings of the common man and work for welfare of downtrodden segments of the society.\nHe praised allied parties for exhibiting great unity and making the motion against the Prime Minister successful.",
