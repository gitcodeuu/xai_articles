The EPC is a great across party across province initiative, and engaging stakeholders from all across is very important.” “Excited to work towards the common objective of promoting education in Pakistan, PPP MPA Rashdi said, “The EPC is a great initiative that will surely help, observe and scrutinize the work of the Department for Educations in the provinces.\nThis will definitely make a difference pertaining to the children’s social needs, schools and colleges based up to the higher education system in our country.” Senator Sana Jamali congratulated civil society and parliamentarians for taking the much needed initiative to forming a parliamentary caucus for education.\nShe ensured that the Balochistan Assembly would extend maximum support to the cause.

Addressing the president, prime minister, parliamentarians, ministers and secretaries of education and literacy in Pakistan, the letter requested support for the EPC and also put forth six recommendations for making transformative decisions impacting millions of children, youth and teachers.\nSharing the evidence from recently launched ASER Pakistan Learning Losses report, the letter stated that that lower primary or grade 3 children need urgent attention, as do other grades. There is an urgency to reorganize school timetables-pedagogy and focus on engaging remedial learning without stigma and light touch assessments to gauge the learning level of the child.\n“Girls’ education and learning has to be a priority with support in schools. The need for second chance programs with Life skills and EdTech skills urgently was highlighted, backed by resources and with better linkages with Waseela-e-Taleem/BISP for girls at risk or OOS.\n” Addressing the lower learning levels in Madrassahs, the letter recommended to assess Madrassahs on the ASER Basic Tools and provided with immediate remedial support. The letter also pointed out the urgent need to integrate Katchi Abadis in policies, planning and budgets; there must be a section in the Department of Education on “Education and Skills” in Katchi Abadis catering to range of education needs: 2nd Chance Learning and TEVT for livelihoods.\nEarly Childhood Education (ECE) – the foundation of all learning and cognitive, social emotional wiring –needs core govt. budgets for holistic support to children, facilities and capacity for caregivers and teachers/assistants.\nTo achieve this all, a New Social Compact is needed across schools and homes; teachers, students and parents, for continuity of learning and support, not just for children but parents to learn about hybrid approaches.\nThey must be part of all solutions in EdTech and social protection options; SMCs must be activated as vital social capital. The EPC will be working concurrently upon these recommendations at provincial and national levels to vigorously mobilize required resources and create pressure on parliament for the enactment of all relevant policies particularly Article 25A and SDG-4 with the support of partner organizations, including Sightsavers,\nPakistan Institute for Parliamentary Affairs, KKAF, Teach for Pakistan, Pakistan Alliance for Early Childhood, Pakistan Coalition for Education, Save The Children, VSO, Care International, Unicef Pakistan, Taleemabad/Orenda, Centre for Social Justice and EdLab Pakistan.",
