He said that all humanly possible measures were taken by the administration to address the situation.\nThe administration had taken emergency measures, but all should realize that such a situation should not arise. He said this was a novel situation in Pakistan as in the past such influx of tourists was never witnessed and we should learn from this incident to avoid such incidents in future.\nHe said that economic situation of the country has improved in the recent past and tens of thousands of people moved to upper areas for tourism.\nTourism should not be discouraged, the government wanted to promote tourism, he replied to a question.\nAnswering a question he said that PTI MNA Sadaqat Abbasi was currently in Murree and supervising rescue operations.",
