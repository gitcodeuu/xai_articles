He said that when the elections time would come, the PTI leadership would show how elections were contested. The minister said that Imran Khan would form the government for next five years.\nThe government has borne the health expenses of all journalists, providing state-of-the-art healthcare facilities to journalists, said Chaudhry Fawad.\nHe said that the journalists and their families will be able to avail treatment facility up to Rs. 1 million per annum from any public or private hospital under the scheme which was launched by the Prime Minister.\nHe opined that the private sector involve the in the health and education sectors was imperative to resolve the problems.\nThe health card programme, he said will provide an opportunity for the private sector to invest in the health sector as the people wanted better treatment and health card will benefit middle and white collared class.\nHe lamented that instead of starting such welfare schemes in Sindh, the provincial government was spending money on construction of private buildings.\nFawad Hussain said that a doctor had been appointed in Karachi on a salary of Rs 7. 6 million which was regrettable as all hospitals and health system of Sindh had been ruined.\nHe said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government had decided to provide equal health facilities to all segments of the society. “We are providing equal treatment facility without differentiating between rich and poor,” said the minister.\nHe said after Lahore, journalists from Islamabad and journalists affiliated with all press clubs would be provided health card facility.\nThe minister urged the Sindh government to join health card programme. Journalists have also been included in the Prime Minister’s Low Cost Housing Scheme, Chaudhry Fawad said adding that all journalists could fulfill their dream of home by getting loans under this scheme.\nHe said that loan would be given for five marla house out of which Rs 300,000 would be the subsidy by the government.\nThe minister said that to remain relevant print media will have to move towards digitization as in the future, digital media will replace formal media. He revealed that during the last three years, advertisements worth Rs 12 billion had shifted from formal media to digital media.\nThe minister said that 5G technology would bring a new revolution and the current media model should be ready for this change. He promised that like Karachi Press Club, Lahore Press Club will also be turned into a digital media lab as the government wanted to provide learning opportunities to journalists.\nHe said 100 big companies made a profit of Rs 929 billion on the stock exchange, whereas media houses made 35 to 40 percent profit.\nHe said that due to profit earning, the media owners and companies should increase the salaries of their workers. “Today our industries are fully functional, the farmer is prosperous as Rs 1100 billion has been transferred to agriculture sector and the economy is growing at a rate of 5 percent,” said Chaudhry Fawad Hussain.\nHe acknowledged that there were problems for the salaried class and the private sector should play its role to resolve these problems. “Prosperity of working journalists is necessary, we have to work for it,” he said.\nHe said that the media gave unnecessary hype to Pervez Khattak and Hamad Azhar’s talk during Parliamentary party meeting.\nTo a question, he said that the Chairman of ITNE would be appointed within a month which would give electronic media workers the right to go to court if their contract was not fulfilled.\nHe said that PML-N and PPP obstruct legislation for protection of journalists.To a question, he said that advertisements of any media outlet could not be stopped.\nHe asked the media people to talk to PPP and PML-N for enactment of law and make sure adopt the law when comes.\nThe government would provide Rs .5 million loan to a journalist for digital journalism on the guarantee of the Press Club.\nHe said so far 5,669 people in Lahore division have benefited from health card facility.
