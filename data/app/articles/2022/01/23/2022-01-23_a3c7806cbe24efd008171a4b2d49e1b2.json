  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 23 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan Sunday categorically said that he would not meet Opposition Leader in the National Assembly Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif, because it would amount to compromising over Sharif family’s crimes.\nDuring the fifth session of live “Aap Ka Wazir Azam Aap Key Sath’ programme, the prime minister said that he would not give Sharif’s family any NRO because doing so would be huge treason with the country.\nThe prime minister said that he did not consider (Shabaz Sharif) as an opposition leader rather he treated him as man who had committed serious crimes against the nation and country.\nResponding to a query, the prime minister said an opposition leader had a stature but in the instant case, Shahbaz Sharif was delivering lengthy speeches in the parliament without caring to give reply to a number of graft and corruption cases pending with the courts.\nHe did not want to respond to Ramzan sugar mills case, transferring of Rs3.7 billion in the account of a peon Maqsood and Rs16 billion in the accounts of other servants. They were accounted for Rs8 billion cases pending with NAB, he added.\nThe prime minister said that Sharif family should take some pity on this country. Expressing his wonder, he said by using delaying tactics in the courts, what kind of service they were rendering to the democracy and setting example for a civilized society!\n“If I meet him, it will amount to acceptance of their wrongdoings (corruption) as no longer a punishable crime in a civilized society,” he stressed.\nThe prime minister said that he wanted the nation to imbibe the basic principles taught by the Holy Prophet (Peace Be Upon Him) regarding rule of law and equal treatment of all segments of society.\nHe stressed that as followers of the Holy Prophet (PBUH), the nation should follow those principles.\nHe regretted that different trends had been set in the society for the powerful and the weak. The ordinary criminals had been languishing in the jails and the powerful elite was residing outside the country. Those criminals had been showered with flower petals.\nIf such were the standards in society, then set the jails open for the ordinary criminals, he said, adding that he was ready to talk to everyone including TLP and Balochs, but would not talk to such elements who had siphoned off the country’s wealth, the prime minister elaborated.\nHe said according to the World Bank rule of law index, Switzerland topped the list with 100 percent score. In Singapore, a minister committed suicide due to his corruption and in the US a powerful family also followed the same course to avoid public shame.\n“Unless we follow the path of our Holy Prophet (PBUH), we cannot aspire to get prosperity,” he said, adding (Imran Khan) had no magic wand to set the wrong things right. The prime minister opined that a society had to fight such crimes and trends.\nTo another question, he invited the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to return back and face the criminal cases. “I am waiting for your return to Pakistan, please return back,” he added.\nAbout the opposition parties’ proposed march, the prime minister said the public would not come out on the streets to save their corruption.\nHe said the public had come out on the streets to support two leaders in the country, one Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and then came out to support him in his campaign against corruption.\nThe prime minister said not a single party in the country ever brought supporters in huge numbers to Minar-e-Pakistan, and it was the PTI that did it by four times.\nHe said the corrupt junta could not befool the public anymore. Though there was an issue of price hike but the public would not come out on the streets as they understood two families’ theft and corruption.\nThe prime minister further said that his party would complete its current term in power and would also return to government in the next term, owing to tackling of historic and huge economic challenges faced by any past government in the country’s history.\nHe also warned the opposition parties that he would become more dangerous in case he did not remain in power.\n“You will not find any place to hide. Whatever you have done with the country, the people knew it very well, the volcano is brewing. They will flee the country and hide in London,” he added.\nReferring to Nawaz Sharif, the prime minister said he would not return back to Pakistan out of his love for the ill-gotten pelf.\nOften, they floated rumours of deals to save their party from disintegration, he said, adding they were the elements whose time had run out.\n“The way they treated the country, the nation is not ready to pardon them,” he observed.\nThe prime minister said a three-time prime minister, had been expressing his ignorance about the illegal accumulated wealth and the properties in UK worth billion of rupees. Even his sons were declaring themselves as citizens of UK to evade accountability, he added.\nThe prime minister responding to another question, reiterated that Allah Almighty had bestowed upon him with everything. He had entered into politics, some 25 years back. The party’s manifesto included the establishment of an Islamic welfare state.\nThe framers of the country’s constitution had inserted such ideology, he said, adding his whole life-long struggle hovered around the achievement of this objective.\nHe emphasized that unless they move on that objective, they could not become a nation.\nThe prime minister said from the day first, he had not promised to make Pakistan an Asian tiger or turn Lahore into a Singapore. The correction of mess and issues of the past seventy years would take time, he added.\nThe prime minister ruled out any compromise with the corrupt leaders terming them as ‘the big dacoits of the country’.\nHe said that they wanted to blackmail him. But he would not grant them any NRO of Musharraf who by striking a deal with these two families had done grave injustice with the nation, worse than his imposition of martial law.\nDue to such deal, the nation had to suffer. They now wanted to blackmail his government so that in the end, there could be a deal like Musharraf’s NRO, he said and compared such an act to committing the biggest treason with the country.\nResponding to another question, he said that he wanted the young people to keep in mind Hadiths about the rule of law and verses from the Holy Quran over the duty of Muslim regarding spread of virtue and crushing of evil in a society.\nHe observed that if the nation understood these teachings, they would resolve many issues.\nThe prime minister said Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah had been a follower of those principles.\nThe doctrine of necessity was created for the powerful and elite classes, he said, the cells in jails were filled with the ordinary criminals while the powerful dacoits were roaming freely, he regretted.\nThe prime minister underlined the need for the society to face such challenges and make endeavours to crush the evil tendencies in the society which made the people to treat the corrupt elements as politicians and personalities. In that case, the people would have fears from committing crimes.\nThe prime minister said that former prime minister along with his sons was residing outside the countries in billions of dollars worth properties in the UK. While his finance minister, Ishaq Dar was also residing there along with his kins.\nHe further said that the two royal families in the country had been given VIP treatment which Aitzaz Ahsan had rightly termed as Sharif’s doctrine.\nThey had bribed the judges in the past, that’s why Justice Khosa of the Supreme Court had equated them with the Sicilian mafia, he added.\nPreviously, the prime minister had held four such like live Tv sessions with the public last year. About 86 questions, 74 on telephone calls and 12 others via social media, were responded by the prime minister during these sessions.\nThe prime minister to a question said his political opponents were raising hue and cry over the price hike to save their skins from accountability.\nCiting a World Bank’s report, he said which acknowledged that government had succeeded in reducing poverty in the four categories.\nCountry’s GDP had been increased by 5.37 per cent despite the coronavirus challenge, which was also hurtling the global world economies. In India the growth rate had been in the negative, he added.\nBut on the other hand, they had been hearing opposition parties’ chorus joined by certain media persons, lamenting that the country had been destroyed, he added.\nEnumerating the achievements of his government, the prime minister said that construction sector was witnessing the boom and the private banks were extending loans to the low-income group.\nThe government had got the issue of pending foreclosure law resolved through the courts. About 290 billion rupees loans were sought by the applicants and out of which a total of 123 billion rupees loans had been approved. A sum of Rs40 billion loan was released to the applicants from the low-income group to construct their homes.\nBesides, the prime minister said the government was constructing 45,000 housing units, and the private sector had launched 324 projects envisaging the construction of 3 million houses.\nHe said with such economic activities, 30 allied industries with the construction sector were also being benefitted.\nThe prime minister said with the bumper crops, the people in villages had earned Rs1400 billion and witnessing an increase of Rs165,000 in the total income of per head.\nThe large-scale manufacturing witnessed a growth of 10 percent.

In Punjab alone, 400 billion rupees had been allocated for the purpose. No one ever thought of spending such huge amounts on the social sector in the past. He termed it as Pakistan’s biggest social network system.\nThe prime minister said that the private sector would be encouraged with provision of low-cost lands for construction of health facilities and import of duty-free equipment.\nThe prime minister said positive criticism was a good thing and stressed upon differentiating between propaganda, fake news and reality.\nHe said certain mafia had been spreading disappointment in the society by negatively projecting the economic picture of Pakistan. They had the vested interests to dislodge the government at any cost, the prime minister observed, regretting that certain media persons were also spreading depression.\nContrary to their claims, the Bloomberg journal had put Pakistan as a country moving on a sustainable path, he added.\nHe said the global inflation and price hike of commodities triggered by sharp disruption in the supply and demand chain, due to Covid 19 pandemic, had affected all the countries of the world alike including Pakistan.\nThe post-Covid scenario sent the prices of vital commodities skyrocketing and Pakistan was not the only country in the world to bear the brunt of imported global price hike, he added.\nTo a question of Saeeda, a resident of Rawalpindi, the prime minister said that it was an age of IT and mobile cells and within one hour, he got the information about the public issues.\nHe admitted that the price hike was the major issue that often kept him awake. The prime minister said a good journalism always kept the people abreast of the latest situation and urged the need of projecting the issue with its true perspective.\nHe said when his government came to power, the current account deficit was around 20 billion dollars causing pressure on the value of rupee.
