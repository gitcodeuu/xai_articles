In first six months of the last fiscal year, he said, the exports stood at $ 12.110.\nOnly in December, the minister said, the exports remained at $2.761 billion with 32 percent surge as compared to same month of the fiscal year 2020-21.\nIf the exports continued increasing with the same pace, he expressed confidence that the country would witness the history’s highest-ever growth of $30 billion in this sector by end of the current fiscal year by the grace of Allah Almighty.\nFarrukh regretted that the exports sector faced destruction due to wrong economic policies introduced by the past regime of Nawaz Sharif and Ishaq Dar.",
