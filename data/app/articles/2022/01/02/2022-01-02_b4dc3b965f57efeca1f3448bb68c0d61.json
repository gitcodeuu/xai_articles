He opined that a society had to take stand against corruption making it unacceptable.\nDr Yusuf further likened the issue of corruption to a rotten apple which could decay a society.\nHe said the Holy Quran had explained the issue of corruption and its impacts upon individuals and society.\nHe further said that Islam had tasked the men to take care of the womenfolk and children in a society, stressing that youth should be inculcated to honour women.\nThe Holy Prophet (PBUH) had always stressed upon respect and protection of the women and children, he added.\nDr Timothy Winter/Abdal Hakim Murad of Cambridge, UK, said that information on mobile phones for the young generations was a real challenge for the most of societies across the globe.\nThe youth had become addicted to certain undesirable material which led to permanent damage, he added.\nHe said that use of internet had now become a global phenomenon which should be resolved through global efforts.\nHe regretted that thousands of cases of harassment against women had been reported.\nDr Murad said the modernity had brought manifold issues and the crises was ever-escalating and also referred to ‘Me Too’ movement launched in US which reflected societal changes.\nDr Recep Senturk, a Turkish academic, and president USUL Academy, Turkey, shared that in the face of global problems, the Muslim youth should be advised to adopt ethics derived from the Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (PBUH).\nThey should be encouraged to develop their intellectual independence by following the Sunnah and rid themselves from the global hegemony, he added.\nHe said the Holy Prophet (PBUH) had been an embodiment of blessing for all races and ages.\nDr Chandra Muzaffar, a Malaysian sociologist and thinker, suggested holding of conferences of the Muslim youth so that they could participate and speak out their minds and articulate their position over the contemporary challenges and solutions.\nHe said during the climate change conference in Switzerland, the youth participants had vented their anger against climate issues and shared their thoughts.\nDr Chandra acknowledged that Muslim youth had respect for the dignity of human beings, adding the Holy Prophet (PBUH) had brough different people together.\n“The people across the world should realize that all burning issues in today’s world are the shared challenges to which Islam had beautifully provided solution centuries ago,” he said.\nDr Osman Bakar, an emeritus professor of philosophy at the University of Malaysia, opined that it was encouraging that students in universities and colleges were keen to learn about the spiritual traditions.\nHe emphasized upon interfaith and intercultural dialogue which would bring stability in the future. The religion of Islam had stressed upon interfaith harmony.\nSheikh Abdullah bin Bayyah, Chairman of Fatwa Council UAE, said that they were living in the age of globalization and invasion of social media, internet and other things which had been casting huge impacts upon the youth.\nHe suggested the idea of seeking ‘Sakinah’ by the youth which meant peacefulness of mind. It was the quality of soul that helped in removal of agitation from a person, he maintained.\nSheikh Abdullah underlined the need for the establishment of a university for the Muslim youth that could focus on teaching morals and ethics.\nHe said the youth of Pakistan should learn more about the people like Allama Iqbal.\nThe prime minister hinted that he would be holding similar dialogue with the renowned scholars in the future so as to get their enlightening views about the contemporary issues.\nHe said his idea of the establishment of National Rehmatul-lil-Alameen Authority in Pakistan was to unite the human beings under the teachings of Seerah and raise standards of morality and ethics in the society.",
