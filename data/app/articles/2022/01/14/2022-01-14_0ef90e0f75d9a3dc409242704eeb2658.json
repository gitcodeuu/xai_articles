  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 14 (APP): Minister for Interior, Sheikh Rasheed Ahmad on Friday said that the Nawaz Sharif family had no role in the country’s future politics, advising them to avoid the further wait for having any good opportunity.\nTalking to the media, Sheikh Rasheed said that no drastic change was happening in the country’s politics without Nawaz Sharif and added that all ‘four Sharifs” were now minus and had no further role in the politics.\nHe said that the present government of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) would complete its tenure and expressed the confidence that it will also return again for the next tenure.\nThe minister said that opposition parties were in a state of disappointment and stress as against their wishes, the present government was successfully running the state affairs. He said that the government had already completed its three and half year tenure while the opposition need further warm-up time.\nSheikh Rasheed said, “The opposition has been saying since last year that PTI is going to lose power, but it should clear any misunderstanding about the government. Prime Minister Imran Khan is so lucky to have got such incompetent and ineffective opposition.”\nHe said the present opposition had no vision to understand the prevailing situation and they had selected the wrong time for holding the protest. “They already lost their time and now they will get nothing but to spoil their and our time.”\nSheikh Rasheed said, “We will welcome them and not stop them or take any action against their long-march unless they hold peacefully.” He added, they are politically visionless people as there was no reason for holding two separate long-march in the country when local government elections are going to be held soon.\nHe said the government had to go to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) due to the weak economic policies of the past governments. “Opposition parties have looted the country’s money during their tenures without realizing the negative impacts of their wrongdoings on all sectors of the country.”\nHe said,” Their feeble economic plans compel us to accept this hard deal just to move the economy of the country on right track.” He expressed the hope that things would improve now and more investment would come in the country besides progress in other sectors.\nHe said that this year 23 March will be an important day as many important personalities of the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC) are likely to visit Pakistan. He predicted that the Chinese J-10C flying pass is also expected in the historical 23 March Pakistan Day parade.\nHe said that under Ehsas Programme an amount of Rs 180 billion had been distributed to 15 million deserving people of the country. He added the PM had approved the expansion in storage capacity of two dams in order to generate additional 10,000 MW electricity from 13 million acre-feet (MAF) to 26 MAF.",
