Kashmiris have been deprived of their rights to life, food, health, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, and above all the right to self-determination,” he added.\nThe Prime Minister said that “Pakistan calls upon the international community to demand from India and immediate end to its state-terrorism against Kashmiris and allow access to international human rights and humanitarian organizations to the occupied territory.”\n“Pakistan will continue to extent all possible support to the Kashmiris till the realization of their inalienable right to self-determination and a just resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with the relevant UNSC resolutions and the wishes of the Kashmiri people,” he stressed.",
