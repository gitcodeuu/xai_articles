We sit together and resolve all related problems,” he said.\nThe Special Representative said that every minority in Pakistan were enjoying religious freedom and questioned why were critics turning a blind eye to the atrocities taking place in India where churches and mosques were being set on fire and minorities were being threatened to leave the country?\nHe said the role of minorities in the Pakistan movement was unable to ignore, adding the orders of Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah (RA) regarding minorities were being implemented in the country in letter and spirit and the new security policy was its continuation.\n“Today, when I come to church and offer prayers, and the representatives of minorities come freely to mosques and places of worship of other religions, then this is definitely the best example of religious harmony,” he said.\nTo a question about a decision of the Lahore High Court about ‘Iddat’, he said that there were some loopholes in the decision which needed to be removed. He requested the judiciary to reconsider this decision.\n“It will be better to seek the opinion of Darul Ifta, Islamic Ideological Council and Muttahida Ulema Board on such matters so that decisions against Qur’an and Sunnah are not revealed according to Shariah,” he suggested.\nEarlier, the meeting began with the recitation from the Qur’an and the Bible and Dr. Majeed welcomed the Special Representative of the Prime Minister and presented him a bouquet.",
