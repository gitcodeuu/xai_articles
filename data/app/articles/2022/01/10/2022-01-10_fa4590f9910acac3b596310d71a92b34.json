His activism both off and online has brought nightmares to India and its stooges in IIoJK and that is why such fraud allegations are being leveled against these honest and brave Kashmiri resistance activists,” Afridi said.\nThe Kashmir Committee chairman said leveling fraud allegations against Dr Dar shows ‘frustration of the saffron-clad Indian police in IIoJK’.\n“I had already intimated the international community about the nexus between Indian police and Israeli forces and how some Indian police officials from IIoJK received training in Tel Aviv. Bringing fraud charges against Dr Dar is a leaf from the same playbook formulated by Israeli state against Palestinian activists wherein they target anti-colonial and anti-occupation activists living outside their homelands,” Afridi said.\n“India can go to any extent to silence such vocal and brave voices,” Afridi warned and urged the international community including the United Nations, OIC and UNHRC to hold India accountable.“The world community and people who claim to be torchbearers of human rights and peoples’ freedom must name and shame India for making mockery of international law and fundamental human rights.”\nAfridi said Dr Asif Maqbool Dar is a brave son of his Kashmiri motherland. “Dr Dar is an honorable man, son, husband, father and a thorough professional,” said Afridi.\n“Dr Dar’s clarity on India’s occupation of Kashmir and his passion for resistance against the occupation is an inspiration for thousands of Kashmiri youth and resistance activists. Pakistan is proud of such Kashmiris,” the Kashmir Committee chairman said.\nReferring to reports of another fraud case filed by police stooges of India in Kashmir against UK-based Kashmiri activist Muzzammil Ayyub Thakur, Afridi said, “This is another brazen mockery of international law.”\n“Kashmiris will fight back such mockery by resorting to lawfare and knocking every international institution since people in IIoJK have rejected India and its rule,” Afridi concluded.",
