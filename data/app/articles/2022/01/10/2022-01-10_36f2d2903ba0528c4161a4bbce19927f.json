She said that Russia’s S-400 missile system’s sales to India should not hinder progress in Moscow -Islamabad relations.\n“Pakistan can involve Russia and China along with US on a holding constructive dialogue on arms control arrangements and arms control mechanisms,” she suggested adding that Russia was a potential contender for a role for resumption of dialogue between India and Pakistan on Kashmir dispute and checking the aggravation in the regional balance.\nRussian scholar Dr. Irina Nikolaevna Serenko said nascent Pakistan-Russia defense ties can grow with time, but the two needed to build the relationship through economic cooperation particularly the conclusion of the agreement for the construction of the 1100 km gas pipeline called the Pak Stream Gas Pipeline.\nShe said President Putin could have visited Islamabad last month as well when he went to India if there could have been a substantive outcome like the gas pipeline deal. She said “there were no big agenda for Putin to visit Pakistan” because of slow progress on gas pipeline.\nShe said that Moscow’s foreign policy approach was to simultaneously develop ties with both India and Pakistan as illustrated by Foreign Minister Lavrov’s visits to both countries last year.\nDr. Vladimir Sotnikov of Russian International Affairs Council said economic cooperation formed the most prospective area for developing convergences between Pakistan and Russia.\n“I think that the very attractive area of enhancing cooperation between Russian Federation and Islamic Republic of Pakistan is the economic area because we have a lot to share. First of all enhance the trade relations and supply from Russia heavy machinery,” he said adding that subsequently the two can move towards civilian nuclear cooperation.\nExecutive Director SVI Dr. Zafar Iqbal Cheema said that despite significant progress in diplomatic ties, the economic relations still had to be improved.\nHe hoped that economic ties would soon reach the desirable level because of “warm political and diplomatic relations”.",
