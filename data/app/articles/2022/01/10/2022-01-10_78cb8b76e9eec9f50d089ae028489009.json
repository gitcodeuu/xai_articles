We are going to put all the sites on the website. Today, its final approval has been given and anyone will be able to check the sites and the plantation activities. The step is being taken to ensure complete transparency for the project.”\nHe said that more urban Miyawaki Forest project would be set up in Rawalpindi city to provide the citizens clean and green environment.\nTo a question about cutting of trees from forests of Kotli Sattian he said that an operation was launched earlier and strict action was taken against those involved in illegal activity.\nAmin Aslam informed that a comprehensive strategy was being evolved to protect the forests.\nLocal residents of the forest areas would be hired to ensure protection of the forests.\nThey would be made forest guards to prevent fire incidents in the forest areas. Such project was implemented in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa which remained successful, he added.\nA plan had been formulated and the project would be implemented soon as the Prime Minister Imran Khan had announced a fund for the project, he said.\nTo another question about Murree incident, the Minister said that a high powered inquiry committee had been formed to prepare a report within few days, adding, Pakistan was among top 10 countries affected most by climate change.\nThe alerts issued by the Met office should be taken seriously and immediate planning should also be done, he added.\nThe Standard Operating Procedures should also be followed in letter and spirit.
