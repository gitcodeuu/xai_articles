Because the solvents thin the oil in the paint that can also be used to clean paint brushes,” Senior Artist Parveen Khan told APP on Monday.\nShe said the basic rule of oil paint application was ‘fat over lean’, meaning that each additional layer of paint should contain more oil than the layer below to allow proper drying.\n“If each additional layer contains less oil, the final painting will crack and peel. The consistency on the canvas depends on the layering of the oil paint.\nThis rule does not ensure permanence; it is the quality and type of oil that leads to a strong and stable paint film,” she added. Ms. Khan told that oil painting was the process of painting with pigments with a medium of drying oil as the binder.\n“It has been the most common technique for artistic painting on wood panel or canvas for several centuries, spreading from Europe to the rest of the world.”\nThe advantages of oil for painting images include “greater flexibility, richer and denser color, and a wider range from light to dark”.\nBut the process was slower, especially when one layer of paint needed to be allowed to dry before another was applied,” she concluded.",
