  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 24 (APP):Minister for Interior Sheikh Rasheed on Monday underlined the need for building a common narrative against the challenge of terrorism so that it could be tackled in a more effective manner.\nWinding up the debate on a motion moved by opposition in the Senate regarding the recent wave of terrorism in the country, he highlighted the importance of greater unity among all ranks to fight the tendencies of terrorism and extremism.\n“It is welcoming that statements from opposition benches suggest moving together against terrorism. The opposition parties should join hands with the government for building a common narrative against terrorism,” he said.\nHe said they [parliamentarians] were well-informed about the law and order situation in different areas, so “we need to work together.”\nHe informed the House that around 10 police personnel embraced martyrdom in recent incidents of terrorism in Islamabad and Rawalpindi, while law enforcement departments had arrested four terrorists and killed two.Rasheed vowed that the government would foil each and every conspiracy being hatched against the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and the friendship of two iron brothers – Pakistan and China.He said perpetrators of Dasu and Gawadar incidents had been arrested, while culprits of the Johar Town incident had been sentenced to death by the court.\nHe said it was unfortunate that now India was using some ‘criminal paid elements’ to carry out subversive activities in Pakistan.\nHe said Muslims living in India were facing violence just because of having good sentiments for Pakistan.\nThe minister said around 21 kilometers fencing work along the Pak-Afghan border and 200 kilometers in Balochistan border areas were being built.\nHe said the country’s armed forces were effectively tackling the issue of terrorism in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, while in Punjab and Sindh, the respective Counter-Terrorism Departments were busy handling the disgruntled elements.\nCommenting on the opposition’s planned protest march towards Islamabad on March 23, the minister suggested changing the given date as on that day there would be a number of activities related to the Pakistan Day and the session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers.\nHe also warned opposition of the increased cases of coronavirus and threats of terrorism activities.\nReiterating the firm stance of the government to handle the tendencies of terrorism with iron hands, he said no dialogue was taking place with disgruntled elements.\nHe said the Afghanistan government had assured that it would not allow anyone to use its soil against Pakistan. He said the government was ready to talk to any person within the ambit of the Constitution and law. He, however, made it clear that no talks with anyone were taking place at the moment.\nEarlier, Senators Kamran Murtaza, Mian Raza Rabbani, Dost Muhammad Khan, Anwar ul Haq Kakar, Azam Nazeer Tararr, Tahir Bizinjo, Abida Azeem, Umer Farooq, Mushtaq Ahmed, Saadia Abbasi, Afnan Ullah Khan, Palwasha Muhammad Zai Khan, Rana Maqbool and Maulana Atta-ur-Rehman spoke on the increased incidents of terrorism and called for taking required and collective measures to tackle this scourge.",
