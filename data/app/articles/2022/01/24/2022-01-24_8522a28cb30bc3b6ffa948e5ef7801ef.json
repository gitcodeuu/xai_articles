The International Day of Education is observed globally on January 24 every year.\n“Ehsaas Taleemi Wazaif ” android application has specifically been developed to enable enrolment of children from Ehsaas eligible households at their doorstep.\nDuring the event, Dr. Sania herself enrolled a girl in the school stipends program.She sat with children, mothers, and teachers and guided them about the end-to-end digital enrollment process through the newly launched android app.\n“Education offers the poorest families a ladder out of poverty and a path to prosperity. That is why Ehsaas is focusing on improving the education access of the poorest families through its school stipend program. Facilitating people to self-enroll their children under the program, we have also introduced the app today. Using this app, families can enroll their children themselves at their doorstep without visiting any office”, said Dr. Sania Nishtar while speaking to the media.\nIn the next three years, the Ehsaas Taleemi Wazaif program intends to bring 10 million deserving children into its fold from 160 districts of Pakistan. To date, over 6.7 million children have already been enrolled.\nThe purpose of the Ehsaas Taleemi Wazaif Program is twofold – to assist vulnerable households and reduce the number of out-of-school children. Currently, there are 18.7 million out-of-school children in Pakistan.\nAccording to the Ehsaas policy, Ehsaas Taleemi Wazaif gives a higher amount of stipend to girls as compared to boys.\nStipends are given from primary to the higher secondary level to children aged 4-22 years from families eligible in the Ehsaas ecosystem. The program encourages parents to send their children, particularly girls to schools. All payments are linked to a satisfactory school/college attendance of children.\n“Our government has also introduced Ehsaas graduation bonus for girls completing the 5th grade to address the issue of girls dropping out of school”, stated Dr. Sania.\nToday, Ehsaas is also hosting a panel discussion on, “Role of conditional cash transfers in improving Human Capital Development in Pakistan”.\nThe virtual event will bring together Dr. Christian Turner, British High Commissioner to Pakistan; Najy Behnhassine, Country Director, the World Bank; Yong Ye, Country Director, Asian Development Bank; Aida Girma – Country Representative, UNICEF; and Director-General Ehsaas Conditional Cash Transfers, Naveed Akbar.\nThis year’s International Day of Education is a platform to showcase the most important transformations that have to be nurtured to realize everyone’s fundamental right to education and build a more sustainable, inclusive, and peaceful future.",
