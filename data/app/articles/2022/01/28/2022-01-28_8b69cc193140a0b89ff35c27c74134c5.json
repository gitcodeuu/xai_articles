  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 28 (APP):Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) Prime Minister Sardar Abdul Qayyum Niazi Friday said India had intensified its reign of terror in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu & Kashmir (IIOJK), besides imposing strict restrictions on media to conceal the massive killings of innocent Kashmiris by its forces. He expressed these views in a meeting with Ambassador of the  European Union  Androulla Kaminara here at the Jammu and Kashmir House.\nThe AJK prime minister said India was involved in the massacre of Kashmiri people, urging the international community to break its silence and protect the children, the elderly and women from Indian state terrorism.  He said seven decades had lapsed but the Kashmiris were looking to the United Nations and the European Union for the implementations of UN for granting them their internationally recognized right to self-determination.\nPrime Minister Niazi urged the international community to  pressurize India to implement the UN resolutions and allow the international human rights organization to review the grave  human rights situation in the IIOJK.  He said the European Union had raised their voices regarding the Kashmir issue  and rejected the Indian illegal action of August 5, 2019 and expressed solidarity with the Kashmiri people.\nThe meeting also discussed issues relating to the EU cooperation for education, health, tourism development and human resource development in Azad Kashmir.  Ambassador Kaminara  assured the AJK PM that the EU would fully support the efforts for the development of Azad Kashmir and the empowerment of women and youth.\nThe EU envoy took keen interest in the development of Azad Kashmir, improvement of infrastructure and expressed the hope that the coming local body elections  would play an important role in strengthening democracy.",
