The government wouldn’t tolerate any interference in the independence of judiciary, he added.\nThe adviser said the world’s largest institutions were praising to the fact that with the facility of Health Card, every citizen of the country can avail the facility of medical treatment up to Rs. 1 million without any discrimination.\nThis was the real change that has been brought about by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nBaber Awan said it was unfortunate that the people did not have access to justice. In this regard, the present government has done four major things.\nThrough the web portal, the prime minister redeemed the lands of overseas Pakistanis and addressed the issues of poor and widows.\nHe said that the government was bringing legal reforms package, adding that it would be a huge package in the history of the country.\nHe has also given his suggestions in this regard, he said.\nThe cabinet has approved it.
