Earlier addressing the book launching ceremony, Fawad said Sheikh Rashid had always represented the bright side of Pakistani politics, and he deserved appreciation for his political services.\nHe said Sheikh Rashid had been the pivot of national politics since he contested the first election in 1977. He started his journey as a political activist and today he was a famous political personality of the country. Even today, he added, the Pakistani media was eager to cover Sheikh Rashid’s activities and highlight his opinions.\nHis analysis about the country’s politics had its own importance, Fawad remarked. He said Sheikh Rashid in his book “From Lal Haveli to General Assembly” narrated the story of his political journey.  Fawad congratulated the interior minister on the successful launch of his book.",
