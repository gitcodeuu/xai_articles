  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 5 (APP): Prime Minister Imran Khan on Wednesday urged the international community especially the United Nations to take action on India’s war crimes in Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\n“The international community, especially the UN must take action on India’s war crimes and the crimes against humanity in IIOJK, as Kashmiris continue to reject and resist Indian occupation and oppression”, Imran Khan said in a twitter post on the occasion of Self-Determination Day.\nThe Prime Minister said that the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) commitment of a UN-supervised plebiscite in Kashmir remained unfulfilled as the Hindutva-Modi government brazenly violated UNSC resolutions, international humanitarian laws and international conventions including the 4th Geneva Convention; and committed war crimes by seeking to alter status and demography of IIOJK\n“Pakistan remains steadfast in its commitment to the just Kashmiri struggle for self-determination,” he maintained.",
