He said that the unabated genocide of the oppressed Kashmiris at the hands of Indian occupation forces and the brazen violations of international laws and commitments made by India before the various international fora have brought the whole world at the brink of yet another world war.\nThe APHC Vice Chairman said that the United Nations Security Council in its resolution passed on 5th January 1949 endorsed a binding to settle the Kashmir dispute through a free and fair plebiscite. He said this resolution established self-determination, which has been recognised as the most peaceful and democratic formula in the modern world, as the governing principle for the settlement of the dispute.\nGhulam Ahmad Gulzar maintained that that since 17th of January 1948 till 21st December 1971, the UN had adopted a total of 27 Kashmir related resolutions, which nullified the Indian claim on Kashmir and proved beyond any doubt that Kashmir is an internationally recognised dispute. He denounced the Indian stubbornness, illegal, illogical and inhuman approach vis-à-vis the Kashmir dispute.\nThe APHC Vice Chairman maintained that it is the sole responsibility of the UN to address the burning world issues including the Kashmir dispute and save the contemporary human race from the inevitable threat of their world war.\nHe strongly condemned the incessant killing spree in IIOJK by Indian occupation forces to suppress their freedom movement. He also paid rich tributes to the youth martyred by Indian troops in Srinagar, Kulgam and other parts of the occupied territory.\nAPHC leader, Abdul Ahad Parra, in a statement in Srinagar deplored that the people of IIOJK were facing the worst Indian state terrorism due to the criminal silence adopted by the United Nations on the grim situation in the territory.\nHe said the people of Jammu and Kashmir will continue their just struggle till they were given their inalienable right. He appealed to the international community and the UN Secretary General to take steps for resolving the Kashmir dispute in accordance with the UN resolutions and the aspirations of the Kashmiris people for ensuring permanent peace in South Asia.\nAPHC leaders, Syed Bashir Andrabi and Khawaja Firdous, in a joint statement in Srinagar said that it was time to implement the resolution adopted by the United Nations on Kashmir on January 5, 1949 to establish lasting peace in South Asia. They said the Kashmir dispute could not be resolved for last seven decades due to stubbornness of India while Pakistan has been advocating its peaceful settlement from the day one.\nSyed Bashir Andrabi and Khawaja Firdous said that the Kashmiri people were fighting peacefully for their birthright and India was trying to suppress their struggle by military power. They appealed to the United Nations and the international community to impress upon New Delhi to settle the lingering dispute by giving the Kashmiris their right to self-determination.\nAPHC women leaders, Farida Bahenji and Yasmeen Raja, in their joint statement issued in Srinagar called upon the UN Security Council to fulfill its promise made to Kashmiris 74 years ago of settling the Kashmir dispute by holding a plebiscite in Jammu and Kashmir.\nThey said that the UN Security Council resolution of January 5, 1949 and other similar resolutions on the Kashmir dispute were a fact that could not be denied.\nFarida Bahenji and Yasmeen Raja said unfortunately by refusing to implement these resolutions, India has obstructed the settlement of the Kashmir dispute.

He said that Narendra Modi-led fascist Indian government repealed the special status of IIOJK on August 5, 2019 in gross violation of the UN resolutions and was trying to change the demography of IIOJK.\nHe said that it was the responsibility of the United Nations and the international community to force India to fulfill its commitments regarding the resolution of the Kashmir dispute.\nAPHC leader, Chaudhry Shaheen Iqbal, in a statement issued in Srinagar said that precious human lives were being lost in IIOJK due to India’s stubbornness on the Kashmir dispute.
