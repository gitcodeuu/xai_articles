In 2020, Pakistan’s import of mobile phones was 24.51 million compared to 13.05 million sets produced locally.\nVarious Chinese mobile phone manufacturers have played a key role in Pakistan’s production boom in 2021, according to the PTA.\nLocal manufacturing plants assembled 9.03 million smart phones while the number of 2G mobile phones was 13.09 million.\n“I would say that our whole venture into manufacturing mobile phones has been a big success,” Dawood, adviser to the Prime Minister for commerce, said in an interview with Arab News on Wednesday.\n“It has been very successful because we now see that every month the number of mobile phones coming into the country is decreasing and the numbers that are being produced and sold locally is increasing.”\nThe PM’s aide said the record levels of local manufacturing were achieved under a new “conducive policy” introduced by the current government.\nThe Mobile Device Manufacturing Policy 2020 set a 49 percent localization target by June 2023, including 10 percent localization of parts of the motherboard and 10 percent localization of batteries.\n“We have developed a policy for local assembling of mobile phones … We are currently looking at becoming a world class assembler of mobile phones,” Dawood said. “We are right now concentrating on low-end mobile phone sets and we hope that soon we will be able to start getting into high-end phones with world class companies.”\nHe said after achieving a milestone in manufacturing, Pakistan was eyeing exports to regional countries and Africa.\nWe have started on an export journey, one or two containers have already moved out of the country. Our strategy is to get our mobile phone exported on a sustainable basis, ” Dawood said.\n“Our strategy is that we export to Afghanistan, the Central Asian Republics and to Africa and as we become more and more experienced, we would be diversifying into the higher end market. We’re hopeful that [we can do this on a] sustainable basis sometime this year, 2022.”\nPakistan’s mobile phone imports increased by 51 percent to over $2 billion during the last fiscal year while the import bill increased by 18 percent during the current fiscal year, July-November 2021, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.",
