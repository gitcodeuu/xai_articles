  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 5 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi Wednesday said that India was on path to self-destruction with its Hindutva policy targeting all minorities, while it was vainly planning to suppress Kashmiri struggle for their right to self-determination with barbaric steps.\nHe said the unending oppression coupled with atrocities and human rights violations committed against the innocent Kashmiris in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and other minorities in India, were resulting into a fire that would eventually engulf India and dawn into freedom of the Kashmiri people.\nThe president was speaking at a book launching ceremony of Dr Muhammad Qasim Faktoo, a political Kashmir prisoner who had been languishing in an Indian jail for the last twenty-nine years.\nThe author’s book “Baang’ provides insight into his sufferings and lifelong struggle against the Indian illegal occupation of the IIOJK.\nThe event was organized by Kashmir Youth Alliance (KYA) in collaboration with the Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir in connection with the observance of Kashmiris’ right to self-determination day.\nThe president said Quaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah had regarded Kashmir as the jugular vein of Pakistan which meant that the Pakistani nation and Kashmiris were tied together in permanent bonds of affections and brotherhood.\nQuaid had realized the Hindu machinations long ago and therefore, he parted ways during 1928, he added.\nThe president observed that injustice was done during the Indo-Pak partition principles whereas promises made with the Kashmiri people by the world community had not been fulfilled.\nHe said India through its unilateral and illegal steps tried to bring demographic changes in IIOJK, but these were denounced by the world bodies and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and global rights bodies.\nThe president opined that the Hindutva policy pursued by the recent rulers had been a reincarnation of the Hindu’s supremacist ideology centuries ago.\nHe referred to a book of Khushwant Singh, an Indian writer, who had predicted doom for India due to its self-destruction course.\nThe president said the Muslims could not be suppressed with injustices and oppression.\nThe use of pellet guns against Kashmiris had been a human disaster. Indian forces had been using rape against women as a weapon to silence the ever-growing voices for freedom, he added.\nHe said India was trying to change its history and there was a continuous onslaught against minorities including Muslims and Christians. “No minority is safe in India,” he said, adding the Christian charity organizations like Mother Tressa Charity was banned from collecting foreign donations while churches were attacked by the Hindu zealots.\nThe president regretted that the world was driven through its priorities and vested interests like trade and economy and was neglecting the humanity.\nHe also reiterated that Pakistan being a morality-based country would continue extending its moral, diplomatic and political support to the Kashmiri people in their just struggle for the right to self-determination.\nThe president said that sacrifices of the Kashmiri leaders like Dr Qasim would ultimately result in freedom of IIOJK from the Indian occupation.\nHe also stressed for further raising the IIOJK issue at the global fora through collective efforts.\nThe president cited the success of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s stance in highlighting the issue of Islamophobia which also echoed in the recent comments of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nSimilarly, the president also credited the government and foreign minister Qureshi for effectively raising the humanitarian issue of Afghanistan and holding a successful OIC meeting.\nChairman Parliamentary Special Committee on Kashmir Shehryar Afridi said that on the Kashmir issue all the political parties in Pakistan were on the same page.\nHe reiterated nation’s full support to Kashmiri’s right to self-determination struggle.\nHe also called upon the world community to realize its commitment made with the Kashmiri people and ensure a plebiscite over IIOJK in accordance with the UNSC resolutions.\nHe also reminded the world to learn from the lessons in history.\nOn the occasion, Ahmad bin Qasim, son of Dr Faktoo, narrated the ordeals of his father after his arrest in 1993.\nHe said the people in IIOJK did not accept Indian illegal occupation.\nImran Riaz Khan, advisor of KYA and Tv anchorperson, also expressed his views.",
