Authorities must immediately release Gul and drop their investigations related to his journalistic work,” the CJP posted on Twitter.\nAccording to media reports, the police had indicated his release but later, his family was told that a criminal case was initiated.\nThe Indian forces had slapped draconian measures to muzzle media in the IIOJK after India stripped the occupied valley of its special laws. A large number of journalists and mediamen have been arrested harassed and subjected to physical torture under so-called laws.",
