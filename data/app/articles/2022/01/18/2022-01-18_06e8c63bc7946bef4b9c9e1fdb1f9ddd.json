  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 18 (APP): Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Political Communication Dr Shahbaz Gul Tuesday said the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) leadership would have to to return the national wealth plundered by them if they wanted a “deal” from the government.\nAddressing a press conference here, he said the Sharif family wanted to escape from the country and for that they were seeking a deal.\nGill said Nawaz Sharif would be deported from the United Kingdom after rejection of his visa. He should better stop the ‘drama of illness’ and return to Pakistan.\nThe Sharif family would have to answer for money laundering of Rs 16 billion, he added.\nGill said all the PML-N leaders had been spreading rumours of a “deal” for the last three to four months, but nothing was on the ground. Some of them wanted to take over the reins of party, he added.\nRecalling the history of Sharifs’ deals, Gill said they first entered in a deal with Zia-ul-Haq, and then with Muhammad Khan Junejo and Mustafa Jatoi respectively. Then Nawaz Sharif became prime minister after stabbing in their backs, he added.\nHe said it was Nawaz, who again cheated Chaudhry Pervaiz Elahi in 1997 and struck a deal with General Musharraf, which was tantamount to betraying his all party leaders.\nThe SAPM said a sum of Rs 7 billion was recovered from the account of their peon Maqsood and Rs16 billion from the accounts of other employees. Ironically, the employees were getting salaries of Rs 10,000-15,000, he added.\nThe PML-N leaders plundered the national wealth at their will while in government and then escaped from the country, he added.\nGill said the national exchequer was empty when Imran Khan came into power.\nTo a question, he said rumors were being spread through Maryam Aurangzeb that Nawaz Sharif was returning to the country after a ‘deal’.\nTo another query, he said the PML-N leaders always deposited corruption money in the accounts of their employees.",
