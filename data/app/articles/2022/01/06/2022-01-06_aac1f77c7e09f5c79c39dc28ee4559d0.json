  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 6 (APP): Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain on Thursday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) had announced its advisory councils for different regions, including Punjab, Sindh and others.\nThe announcement was made during the meeting of PTI’s Central Executive Committee, he said addressing a news conference.\n“Except Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, the PTI has announced its executive and advisory boards in the provinces,” he said. The councils had been constituted separately in Central and South Punjab, besides Sindh.\nThe minister said Minister of State for Information and Broadcasting Farrukh Habib  had been appointed as the PTI’s Information Secretary, and Siraj Khan as Finance Secretary.\nHe said Prime Minister Imran Khan had directed PTI Vice Chairman Shah Mahmood Qureshi and Secretary General Asad Umar for coordinating with provincial presidents with regard to the party’s new organizational set-up.\nThe prime minister, he said, also directed the party to make preparations for the local government elections.\n“We are reaching out to the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) and the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) to build consensus for bringing amendment in the (election) code of conduct,” he said, adding the ministers, prime minister and assembly members should be allowed to participate in the election campaign.\nIt was ‘ridiculous’ to issue notices to political people on running election campaigns in their constituencies, he remarked.\nFawad said efforts were afoot to engage other political parties so that a request should be made to the Election Commission of Pakistan for reviewing the code of conduct.\nFawad said as the LG bodies in Punjab had already completed their tenure, the prime minister had also issued directives for the party workers to start preparations for the upcoming LG elections.\nThe government would ensure transparent local body polls in Punjab like Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, he added.\nThe minister said a comprehensive plan was underway to control inflation in the country. The National Assembly session had been summoned on January 10 and it was expected that the amended finance bill and a law pertaining to the State Bank of Pakistan would sail through it.\nHe said the approval of bills and singing of an agreement with the International Monitory fund (IMF) would usher in economic stability and strengthening the rupee against dollar.\nThe minister said all the economic indicators, including growth rate, were on an upward trajectory in the country, despite the worldwide impact of coronavirus pandemic.\nThe growth rate was at four to five per cent as per the projections of different financial departments, he said while foreseeing economic stability and massive decline in inflation in the coming months.\nNot only the country was politically strong, but its economy was also stable, he said, adding the frustration of opposition would continue to prevail in future.\nAs regards the ECP’s scrutiny report on funding of the PTI, he said it was the only party in the country which kept system of its funding fully organized. It had not only documented its funding efficiently but also submitted its complete record to the ECP, he added.\nSome 40,000 members contributed financially towards making the PTI a ‘strong and powerful’ party, he said, expressing gratitude for the workers who entrusted PM Imran Khan with their donations.\nThe PTI was vindicated in the foreign funding case, he said, adding “We, now, wait for the scrutiny committees’ reports on the funding of PML-N and PPP so that it can be known where they stand.”\nThe minister accused the PML-N of suspicious transactions worth Rs 270 million through a local bank account. An entry of Rs 30 million was made in the name of Bawan Das, while a person namely Hanif Khan deposited an amount of Rs 45 million in the PML-N account which was later transferred by Nawaz Sharif in his own account.\nOn press talks of Maryam Nawaz and Bilawal Zardari, he said the politics of their families had come to an end. The future of PPP and PML-N rested with the young leaders instead of heirs of those parties.\nHe sarcastically remarked that the names of PPP and PML-N should be replaced with the names of families ruling the parties.\nFawad said the rise of corruption and dynastic politics had been ended after Prime Minister Imran Khan came into the power.\nPakistan was on right direction under the leadership of PM Imran Khan, he said, adding a clean government was in power now.\n“Nobody thinks of a scandal-free government in Pakistan,” he remarked.\nAbout an audio leak of Maryam Nawaz, Fawad said those seemed to be original as she herself had admitted that it was her voice after surfacing of an audio leak about her media management.\nMaryam should have resigned from her party position and tender apology to the people of Pakistan and media as well, the minister maintained.\nThe minister asked the PML-N to tender an apology in written itself as Pervaiz Rashid was its senior leader.\nTo a query, the minister said the government was ready to negotiate with the opposition on major reforms including electoral and economic ones.\nHe ruled out of any negotiation on the ongoing accountability drive by the government.",
