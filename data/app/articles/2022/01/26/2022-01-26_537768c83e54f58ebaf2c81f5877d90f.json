She said that an effective oversight system should be enough to halt the malpractices and curb the opportunities of corruption in the prisons.\nThe Implementation Commission also discussed the issue of overcrowded barracks. The provincial representatives apprised the Federal Minister that a major cause of overcrowding in prisons was the huge number of under trial prisoners. The IG Prison KP apprised the Minister that awarding parole was now mandatory in KP and this would greatly assist with reduction of prison population in the future.\nEach provincial member also apprised the Commission of the recently introduced prison reforms and facilities by the prison administrations in all four provinces. They explained that due to security reasons some inmates are segregated and kept in isolation or even in solitary confinement whereas special prison rules are there for this purpose.\nThe Federal Minister emphasized that the outdated and obsolete systems that justify preferential treatment of convicts must be amended and stated that all convicts must be meted out with same treatment.\nWhile referring to an influential convict’s hospital stay in Karachi, she said that there must be non-discriminatory treatment of all prisoners. She praised the CM package that has recently been introduced in jails of Punjab and opined that the provinces may consider the KP model of eliminating all categories of prisoners.\nThe Federal Minister insisted that Prison IGs must share the reports of the oversight committees periodically for the Implementation Commission’s review and advised the prison authorities to ensure that transfers and postings of jail staff are happening on merit basis.\nFor the humane treatment of prisoners by the prison staff and for educating the prisoners on their rights the Federal Minister assured that Ministry of Human Rights can provide its forum and experts for arranging sensitization programs for prison staff. She also desired to make manuals and pamphlets carrying necessary information on rights of prisoners available in jails both in Urdu and regional languages.\nIn her concluding remarks she advised that other provinces should adopt KPK model of non-discriminatory treatment in prisons.",
