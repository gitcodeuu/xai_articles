  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 25 (APP):Balochistan Minister for Agriculture Mir Asadullah Baloch has said that the government is all set to launch the Kissan Cards scheme in March for providing maximum relief to the farmers of the province.\nThe Balochistan government had initially allocated Rs 100 million for the registration and issuance of Kissan Cards to the farmers, he said while talking to APP on Friday.\nUnder the Kissan Card, the minister said, the farmers would be able to avail subsidies on fertilizers, seeds and agri equipment.\nThrough the initiative, he added, the government would provide financial assistance to the farmers, which would help increase crop yields as well as development of the agriculture sector in the province.\nMir Asadullah Baloch said the government would continue its farmer-friendly measures. It had already taken multiple initiatives, including provision of certified seeds to the farmers and conducting research in the sector to increase agricultural production, he added.\nThe minister claimed that the province was provided only 50 per cent of its allocated quota of Urea fertilizer. The farmers already affected by drought-like situation in the province due to absence of rainfall were now faced with the fertilizer crisis, he added.\nAbout 80 per cent of the population of the province, he said, was dependent on agriculture, and fertilizer shortage would hit them hard.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
