  "content": "MULTAN, Feb 25 (APP):Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Sindh Affairs Arbab Ghulam Rahim Friday said the opposition was “kind enough” for helping the government in the  passage of bills in the Parliament.\nAddressing a news conference here at the Multan Press Club, he said the system of governance in Sindh was very poor, which could led to imposition of governor rule if the provincial government did not improve the situation.\nArbab Rahim, who is also a former Sindh chief minister, claimed that the Sindhis did not vote for the Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) in 2018 general election, which, however, came to power in the province as the result of a “deal”.\nThe Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf would ultimately bring a change in the province, he added.\nHe said inflation was an international issue.\nLauding the Health Cards initiative, Arbab Rahim termed its launching a milestone for the incumbent government.\nHe disclosed that Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi enjoyed a close relationship with Prime Minister Imran Khan. Appreciating the ministries performance with commending certificates was a novel idea, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
