Officials from the Ministry of Information Technology and the NITB informed the committee that the objective of the proposed bill was to make the NITB an autonomous body to improve its working and remove obstacles.\nThe officials said being a subsidiary, NITB often faced financial delays, which was hurting the fast-growing sector, especially IT.\nResponding to a query of Senator Dr. Shahzad Waseem, Leader of the House in the Senate the officials said NITB had been successfully providing quality Information Technology services to the government including e-office, National Command and Operation Center application and others.\nHe said NITB was also working on human resource development.
