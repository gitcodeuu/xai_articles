  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 16 (APP): President Dr Arif Alvi Wednesday said the true implementation of laws on women property rights across the country was inevitable for their empowerment, by doing away with the cultural traditions contradicting the Islamic injunctions.\nThe president, addressing the launching ceremony of an Awareness Campaign on Enforcement of Women Property Rights Legislation in Pakistan, said the financial inclusion of women was also equally essential for their empowerment and self-dependence.\nEmphasizing the encouragement of women to go into business, the president said in today’s era of modern technology, women could also establish their businesses while being at home.\nHe repeatedly emphasized the role of media and Ulema to help change the society’s attitude towards the provision of women property rights which had been guaranteed under Islam as well Pakistan’s constitution.\nThe president said by incorporating awareness messages in their dramas and other programs, the media could contribute to aware the women about their rights and the tools available for their protection.\nSimilarly, the Ulema could also utilize their pulpit to convey the message effectively and rectify the cultural traditions depriving the women of their rights.\nReferring to the lynching incidents in Sialkot and Mian Channu, the president said the perpetrators of such incidents were in fact naïve to the teachings of Islam which never allowed the mobs to hold courts on the roads and kill even a mentally deranged person on charges of blasphemy.\nPresident Alvi said though Islam had guaranteed women property rights 1400 years ago but it could not be materialized in our society for being influenced by the cultural traditions.\nThe president spoke high of Balochistan High Court’s verdict of not allowing the transfer of women’s inherited property to anyone prior to her ownership.\nHe also committed to taking up the matter with the Balochistan chief minister to adopt the women property laws being implemented in Islamabad, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nHe said the awareness campaign would also guide the deprived women to approach the ombudsmen offices for their rights and the number of such women could be in millions.\nPresident Alvi also urged the Ombudsmen to publicise their decisions which would aware the women about the remedies available for their property rights.\nBesides Begum Samina Alvi, the federal ministers, ombudsmen and parliamentarians, a number of diplomats from different countries also attended the ceremony for whom the Presidency arranged live English interpretation – a feature introduced permanently to translate the usually Urdu-medium proceedings of the events.\nLaw Minister Barrister Farogh Nasim said the law would cater for the 50% population and requested the Ulema to play their role for awareness because, as per Islam and constitution, it was mandatory, not optional, to provide property rights to the women.\nHe said through the ombudsmen offices, the law would provide for giving property rights to women within months. He also requested the Balochistan government to formulate similar laws.\nThe law minister referred to various articles of the constitution which guaranteed equal rights and services to women.\nHe said the issuance of the succession certificate by NADRA within 15 days was a major step that otherwise used to take years.\nThe minister also told the gathering that the federal cabinet had principally approved the establishment of a special court for the overseas Pakistanis.\nParliamentary Secretary for Law and Justice Maleeka Bukhari appreciated President Alvi and Begum Samina Alvi for taking keen interest in women-specific issues and legislation.\nShe said the women property rights legislation was in fact the fulfillment of the commitment made by Prime Minister Imran Khan during his electioneering and was also part of the PTI’s manifesto.\nChairman of Council of Islamic Ideology Dr Qibla Ayaz said the women in no way could be deprived of their property rights.\nHe said through Ehsaas Program and business loans schemes, the government was playing active role in women empowerment to make them play an active role in society.",
