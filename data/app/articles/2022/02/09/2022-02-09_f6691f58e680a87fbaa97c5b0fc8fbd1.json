But, who stopped them during their over 13 year rule to take such steps for the facilitation of common man,” he questioned.\nHe said such corrupt leaders looted money from national exchequer and transferred into the accounts of other persons to hide their crime.\nThe prime minister said the national health card programme was in line with the vision of Islam’s first socio-welfare State of Medina that cared for the common man.\nHe said the programme was launched to accommodate the people in view of the expensive medical treatment that put an immense burden on them.\nHe said the population ratio of doctors and nurses in Pakistan was very less as compared with the rest of the world.\nThe prime minister lauded Chief Minister Usman Buzdar, health minister Dr Yasmin and their team on the launch of the health insurance scheme.\nHe said besides providing health facilities to women, the government would also ensure their right of inheritance.\nAbout his recent visit to China, he said progress on industrialization was in top focus under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and expressed confidence that it would boost trade activity in the country.\nChief Minister Punjab Usman Buzdar said around 1.5 million people of Faisalabad, Jhang, Toba Tek Singh and Chiniot would benefit from the programme. He said after its launch in Faisalabad Division, about 73 percent households of Punjab would be able to avail the facility.\nState Minister for Information Farrukh Habib said the government’s national health card was a revolutionary programme providing free medical treatment facilities up to Rs. one million per family annually at selected public and private hospitals.\nApart from Punjab, the national health card programme has so far been launched in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Islamabad, Tharparkar district, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Jammu and Kashmir.",
