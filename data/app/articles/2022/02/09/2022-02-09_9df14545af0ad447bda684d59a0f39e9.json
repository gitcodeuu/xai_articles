He said that Pakistan also stood among three top countries where life was returning back to normal after corona.\nHe said that fourth major programme was health card which would completely change the health structure of Pakistan by providing equal treatment opportunities to the individuals in this country.\nThe impact of these schemes would spread on next many decades and centuries, he added.\nHe also paid best tributes to the Chief Minister Punjab Sardar Usman Buzdar and said that instead of lofty claims and cosmetic steps like previous chief minister, Buzdar had allocate Rs 400 billion to provide health insurance to the people in the province.\nSimilarly, he allocated record amount of Rs.750 billion for development projects in addition to establishing 19 universities and constructing and renovating roads.\nHe said that Sardar Usman Buzdar was ranked first among all chief ministers in Pakistan as he was working humbly without projecting and boosting his claims of “serving the masses”.\nHe said that past rulers who looted and plundered the country must land into the jail as they failed to serve and facilitate the masses.
