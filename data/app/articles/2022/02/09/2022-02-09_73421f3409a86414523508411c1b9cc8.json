The objective of the said development projects was to provide the facilities of international standards to the foreign investors for attracting their investment in small and medium industries particularly textiles, poultry and information technology.\nThe FCCI president thanked the prime minister for taking a keen interest in the revival of industries as well as unprecedented support from his cabinet members.\nThe prime minister was told that owing to the business-friendly policies, the country got a foreign direct investment of $1.2 billion during the last three and half years.\nMoreover, 282 industries had been established in Faisalabad Industrial Estate Development and Management Company since 2018 comparing just 25 from 2005 to 2018.\nBesides, import substitution of 40% in tile manufacturing and 60% in the baby diapers industry had been received. The country’s exports have also increased from $24 billion to $30 billion due to the government’s pro-business policies.\nThe prime minister instructed the authorities concerned to take all out measures for the promotion of industrialization to create jobs for the youth.\nHe told the meeting that all the government’s measures for the promotion of industries were part of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf’s manifesto and directed all federal and provincial ministries and departments to ensure its implementation.",
