The ‘‘Huqooq-e-Sindh March” would culminate in Karachi on March 6 after passing through Ghotki, Pano Akil, Sukkar and 27 other districts of the province.\nThe PTI leader further urged the people of Sindh to think about their future as they had been bearing a government for the last 15 years that had burdened them with its corruption.\nHe said that he would be spreading a message of the PTI chairman to the people of the province during his visit to different parts.\n“Get ready and join the procession for a prosperous, stronger and better Pakistan,” he stressed.\nQureshi expressed the optimism that oppressed segments of Sindh that had been groaning under PPP’s corrupt rule would come out and resist the grinding wheel of injustice.\n“Time has come to break shackles of slavery and move ahead. It is a message, a philosophy and a manifesto,” he said, adding that PTI was offering the Sindh people an alternative to what they had been experiencing for more than a decade.",
