  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 23 (APP):National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser on Wednesday said Pakistan aspired to have cordial relations with all the countries based on its national interest. He was speaking at the inaugural session of two-day international conference    “South Asia: Emerging Opportunities and Challenges” held here under the auspices of Institute of Regional Studies (IRS) in collaboration with Friedrich Ebert Stiftung (FES).\nAsad Qaiser lauded Pakistan’s exemplary relations with China, but expressed his concern over the deteriorating relations with India owing to its actions in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).  He highlighted the important role played by think-tanks in informing policy decisions.\nForeign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi, in his written message read at the conference, urged the regional countries and the international community to synergize their efforts to stabilize Afghanistan as well as work towards unlocking the true potential of the over 1.7 billion, mostly young, population of South Asia. Federal Human Rights Minister Dr Shireen Mazari, in her address, highlighted the achievements of her ministry in ensuring basic human rights for the citizens.\nPakistan, she said, adopted a human rights-based approach towards the Covid-19 pandemic by looking after the interests of all segments of the society.  She viewed that in many priority human rights areas, Pakistan had done better than other regional countries. She regretted the increasing polarization, extremism, and Islamophobia in India.\nIRS President Ambassador Nadeem Riyaz urged the participants of conference to focus on tapping into the immense potential of the region by finding ways to surmount regional conflicts, overcome domestic pressures of poverty, inequality, and extremist ideologies, respond to contemporary global challenges, and find ways to collectively engage in bringing prosperity to everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Syed Hassan Akbar, Senior Policy Specialist at the National Security Division,\nexpressed his concern over the increasing global competition and its impact on the region.  He referred to the conflicts in South Asia as a legacy of the colonial system, which, according to him, were exacerbated by global power competition. Pakistan’s priority, he added, was to address the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and assist the country in achieving political stability. While Pakistan was ready to engage with India, it was up to India to create an enabling environment for talks, he said.\nProfessor Swaran Singh of the Jawaharlal Nehru University, India, stated that New Delhi aspired to reach out to the people of Afghanistan, and it was the reason it was sending a large consignment of wheat to that country through Pakistan.  Such cooperation among India, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, he added, could create opportunities for breaking the ice between India and Pakistan as well. Pakistan’s former ambassador to the US Dr Maleeha Lodhi expressed her regret that the thaw in Pakistan-India relations with the re-commitment to observing the ceasefire along the Line of Control could not lead to a broader dialogue between the two countries and ultimately normalization of relations.\nShe listed several steps taken by the Indian government in the recent past, which, according to her, were inimical to peace in the region.  Former adviser to the Prime Minister on institutional reforms and austerity Dr Ishrat Hussain shared that South Asia was still home to 400 million people living below $1.9 per day which was the largest concentration of the poor in the world.\nHe regretted that South Asia was the least economically integrated region of the world. Intra-region trade in South Asia, he added, was only 5 per cent compared to 40-45 per cent in Southeast Asia.  Dr Hussain urged New Delhi to assume the role of a benevolent leader shouldering disproportionate responsibility to take the region to prosperity. The World Bank’s Country Director in Pakistan, Najy Benhassine, said in the past 20 years the share of the population in Pakistan below the poverty line had reduced from 64 per cent to 21 per cent, which translated into 47 million Pakistanis emerging out of poverty.\nPakistan, he added, achieved the remarkable success in reducing poverty despite its average economic growth as compared to its peers in the same period. It proved that Pakistan had done well to transform its relatively low growth rate into a significant reduction in poverty.  He, however, cautioned that the momentum in reducing poverty could be lost because of Covid-19 and climatic changes.\nSri Lankan academic and geopolitical analyst Dr Asanga Abeyagoonasekera urged the US government to avoid viewing its relations with the South Asian countries through the lens of its competition with China. Such an approach, he argued, could further complicate its relations with regional countries. Meritorious Professor at the Karachi University Dr Moonis Ahmar listed six steps for countering extremism, including establishment of rule of law,\nfocus on health and education of the youth, addressing the sense of deprivation among certain segments of the society, strengthening state institutions, enhancing regional civil society cooperation, and responsible media. Other notable speakers at the conference were Pakistan’s former foreign secretary Inam-ul-Haque, Pakistan’s former ambassador to India Riaz Kokhar, and Dr Zahid Shahab Ahmed of the Deakin University Australia.",
