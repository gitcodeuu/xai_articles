The continued Indian oppression has only strengthened the will of the Kashmiris to stand firm in their just struggle.\nHe highlighted that when people started disseminating reality through arts and music, it made a huge difference and the process had already begun in IIOJK.\nHe called upon the international community to peacefully resolve the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with international legitimacy.\nParliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs Andaleeb Abbas and Chairman Parliamentary Committee on Kashmir Shehryar Afridi in their remarks underscored the important role of arts in highlighting the plight of Kashmiris in IIOJK.\nThey called on the international community to deliver on its promise to the Kashmiris for the attainment of their inalienable right to self-determination as was pledged by numerous UN Security Council resolutions.\nThe Foreign Secretary presented Kashmir Solidarity Day mementos to guest speakers.\nA song ‘Meray Kashmir’ was presented by Kashmiri singer Zohaib Zaman to mark the Kashmir Solidarity Day.\nMembers of the diplomatic corps, Kashmiris, former Ambassadors, civil society, academia and artists from various academic institutions also attended the event.",
