We hope by receiving endorsements from committed activists and global recognizance, we can build a united solidarity movement, where we are guided by the vision and demands of Kashmiris for how they determine their future.\nWe recognize that there are important differences among solidarity activists in how best to build a movement. While respecting those differences, we will work to minimise them in order to build a global, united voice in support of Kashmiri self-determination. We hope for your support in helping to stop this inhumane catastrophe”.\nIn an other comment Claire said that “Father of the nation, Shaheed Maqbool Butt is going to make a trend on social media to pay homage to him on the occasion of 38th martyrdom day”.Torch bearing and colorful rallies were taken out from the different parts of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir to pay tribute to Maqbool Butt.\nIndia has over 200 political prisoners which includes many of their leaders, Yasin Malik is just one and seeking freedom through democracy for the Kashmiri people.Let Kashmir Decide International signature campaign to release him and other political pioneers is still ongoing and needs massive global support to have any impact.
