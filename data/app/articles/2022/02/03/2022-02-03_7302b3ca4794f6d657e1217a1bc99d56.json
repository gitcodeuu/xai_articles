It had also invited the expression of interest from the scheduled banks to collect applications of the intending pilgrims for Hajj-2022, the official added.\nSimilarly, talks were under way with private airlines for the transportation of the pilgrims to Saudi Arabia and back, he said. The official explained that the ministry was making all such arrangements for smooth sailing if the Hajj Policy 2022 was announced any time.\nIt had to follow the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority rules and it took a due course of time for making all the following arrangements.\nHe also urged the intending pilgrims not to submit their hard-earned money to any private tour operator as long as the Hajj Policy 2022 was announced by the ministry.\nHe also cautioned the tour operators of strict action for collecting money in the wake of Hajj applications.",
