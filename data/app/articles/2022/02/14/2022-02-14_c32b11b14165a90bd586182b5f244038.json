  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 14 (APP):Chairman of the Senate’s Standing Committee on Information and Broadcasting Faisal Javed on Monday challenged the opposition parties to bring a no-confidence motion today instead of tomorrow as their abortive move would boost the Parliament’s trust for Prime Minister Imran Khan.\nTaking to the media during his visit to Trail-6, Senator Faisal predicted that some members of the opposition parties would not vote in favour of the no-confidence motion.\nThe opposition leaders were stumbling here and there in a futile effort, he added.\nHe said the basic problem was the peon Maqsood for whom all the fuss had been created. His (Maqsood’s) salary was Rs 25,000 while 3.75 billion had been deposited to his account, he said while commenting on the frustration of opposition parties.\nSenator Faisal said the people had rejected the opposition parties and everyone saw what happened in Dera Ismail Khan local polls.\n“They have lost at home and the Pakistan Democratic Movement (PDM) has been shattered,” he said, adding the Pakistan Muslim League Quaid (PML-Q) leaders also stated that such meetings were held regularly.\nHe confirmed that all allies stood with Prime Minister Imran Khan as they had supported the treasury benches in the State Bank of Pakistan bill in the Senate.\nThe allies, he added, also voted for the Finance Bill in the National Assembly. “The allies stand by the test whenever it comes,” he said.\nCommenting on the hue and cry of opposition parties, he said they were all frustrated with what they do and would not get their desired outcome.\nThe goal of opposition parties, he said, was the general election 2023, when they would again taste defeat again. They should better take to the streets then, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
