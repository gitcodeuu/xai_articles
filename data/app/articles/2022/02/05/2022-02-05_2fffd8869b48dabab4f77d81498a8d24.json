The MoU was undertaken to prepare an exhaustive policy on ICJ’s advisory opinion on Kashmir.\nThe panelists called for the release of all the Kashmiris languishing in Indian jails, urging for the stop to all the intimidation and coercion of media and human rights activists in IIOJK by the Indian occupying forces and authorities.\nIn the end, the experts unanimously condemned India’s atrocity crimes in the IIOJK and also urged ICRC and other International Humanitarian Organisations to depute a fact-finding mission to IIOJK.",
