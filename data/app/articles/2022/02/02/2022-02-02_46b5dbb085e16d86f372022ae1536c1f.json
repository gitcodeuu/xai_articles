  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 02 (APP): The Indian Embassy on Wednesday declined to issue visas to Pakistani Zaireen (pilgrims) at the 11th hour for attending the annual Urs of Hazrat Khawaja Moinuddin Chishti (Khawaja Gharib Nawaz) from February 3 to 14 in Ajmer Sharif.\nReligious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony Minister Pir Noor ul Haq Qadri, in a statement, expressed his dismay over the non-issuance of visas to the religious tourists, which was beyond his comprehension. The Indian Embassy, he said, had asked the ministry to complete all the arrangements for the departure of pilgrims for Urs following all the standard operating procedures issued by it.\nThe pilgrims belonging to far flung areas of the country had arrived in Lahore. However, the last moment refusal for issuance of visas had hurt their sentiments leaving them in mental stress, he added. Qadri said Pakistan would take up such an ill-treatment of Zaireen with India at the foreign ministry’s level.\nIndia had violated the 1974 Pakistan-India Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines on the pretext of coronavirus pandemic. On the contrary, he said, Pakistan had always facilitated Hindu and Sikh Yatris from India to visit their sacred sites in a bid to promote interfaith harmony.\nAmid the prevailing COVID-19, it issued visas to both Hindu and Sikh Yatris during the last two years.",
