According to an official handout, as many as 6,803 complaints of expatriates were received on the portal in the category of “Land Grabbing/ Qabza Mafia” in 2021 and 2022.\nOut of this, so far 5,752 complaints have been resolved by retrieving their assets from Qabza Mafia and relatives, holding possession of their lands and houses illegally.\nKhyber Pakhtunkhwa registered the highest complaint resolution rate with redressal of 610, out of 668 complaints received on the portal during the period under review. It was followed by Islamabad and Balochistan with a redressal rate of 90 per cent each.\nSimilarly, Punjab achieved an 87 per cent resolution rate as 3,964 complaints, out of a total 4,576, while in Sindh and Azad Jammu and Kashmir 459 ad 193 complaints were settled, respectively.
