He said the Sindh police was busy in entertaining PPP leaders while people were being robbed in day broad light.\nHe said it was the federation which looks vibrant across the province whether it was Green Line Bus in Karachi, uplift of backward areas in Sindh or provision of clean drinking water or cleanliness of drains. He said the people in Sindh were joining ‘Sindh Huqooq March’, at a large as PPP leaders exploited Sindhis and kept them deprived of their due rights.\nThe minister said the people across the province including Karachi were chanting slogans ‘Go Sindh government go’ due to unjust treatment of PPP to the people. He said the failed opposition would have to wait another year as Prime Minister Imran Khan would complete his constitutional term till 2023.",
