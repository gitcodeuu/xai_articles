We also made efforts for overcoming the current account deficit. Remittances are continuously increasing due to better policies of our government,” he added.\nThe present government, he said, was also paying huge interest on the massive loans taken by the PML-N regime.\nAs regards the PECA Act 2016, he said the government would take action against those who were spreading fake news.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
