He said that national unity was need of the hour, as the enemy was once again trying to spread terrorism in the country.\nHe said that a new government in Afghanistan had taken over in August and Pakistan expects that their land would not be used by terrorists against Pakistan.\nHe said that the terrorist attack in Balochistan was an attempt to spoil relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan. He said that India had a big terrorist network in Afghanistan, but it would never succeed in its nefarious designs. He hoped that the Afghanistan government would arrest terrorists involved in attacks in Pakistan.\nAshrafi said that Kashmir solidarity day would be observed on Feb 5 and special prayers for Kashmiris would be offered for the oppressed people of the Valley. He said that the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) was with Pakistan on the issue of Jammu and Kashmir.",
