  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 18 (APP): Special Assistant to the Prime Minister (SAPM) on Political Communication, Dr Shahbaz Gill said on Friday that the script of oppression and political revenge on the question of theft was outdated.\nResponding to a statement of PML-N Secretary Information Marriyum Aurangzeb, he said the Sharif family had always considered itself above the law.\nHe said Sharifs had even been treating heads of state institutions and esteemed judges as their private servants.\nHe said issuing statements against national institutions while being on bail and trying to become fake revolutionary leaders was an old stunt. Dr Gill said those who caused Rs. 213 million losses to the national exchequer in Ashiana Housing Scheme were the most corrupt people.\nHe said Sharifs’ incompetent courtiers were a detailed description of shamelessness, arrogance and hypocrisy. Those who have created properties through fake telegraphic transactions and bank accounts have hired some servants in the media for their advocacy, he added.\nHe said Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was fulfilling its responsibility of accountability adding that Sharif brothers and courtiers should know that barring the accountability there was no other option left. The thieves and looters will be held accountable without any discrimination, he said.",
