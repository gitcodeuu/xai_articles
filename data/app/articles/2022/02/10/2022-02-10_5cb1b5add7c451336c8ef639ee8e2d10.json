  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 10 (APP): Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi Thursday said that using various diplomatic tools, Pakistan consolidated friendships and strengthened bilateral relations with major powers and key partners across all regions.\nThe foreign minister, addressing a ceremony at Institute of Policy Studies (NIPS) of National University of Science and Technology, said under Prime Minister Imran Khan’s leadership, Pakistan proactively and consistently advanced its diplomatic objectives both bilaterally and multilaterally.\n“We have put to use various tools of diplomacy be it economic diplomacy, science diplomacy, public diplomacy or digital diplomacy, to lead the advocacy for durable peace, inclusive growth and shared development,” he remarked.\nHe said the terms like “multidimensional diplomacy” was reflective of new trends and realities as there were multiple players, factors and forces, influencing the conduct of diplomacy.\nHe said the multidimensional diplomacy currently used tools ranging from economy, cyber space, digital technology, science and innovation to culture and even people-to-people linkages.\nHe said the world had entered the era of battles of narratives with a huge shift in the role of media, their impact on all sphere of life and modern technology being used to influence opinions and push agendas.\nMoreover, as another external factor, the COVID-19 pandemic had upended the global economic systems.\n“We see COVID-19 is not just a global health crisis but a catalyst for long-term geopolitical shifts. COVID vaccines too have aided diplomacy with countries competing for influence through their vaccines and related technology,” he added.\nQureshi said in the backdrop of those shifting trends, geopolitics was reorienting to accommodate new actors and emerging factors and considerations. Pakistan’s foreign policy must respond adequately.\nHe said Pakistan was a leading voice at multilateral forums with strong advocacy on issues of sustainable and equitable development, climate change, debt relief, corruption and illicit financial flows as well as Islamopobia.\nHe said 2021 had also been an exciting year of reform at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs where the strategic planning reform under Vision FO in 2020, became a reality in 2021.\nHe said the Foreign Ministry launched robust Economic Diplomacy agenda as well as Public Diplomacy Initiatives besides engaging in large scale digital reform and leveraging Science Diplomacy.\nReferring to Afghanistan situation, he told the gathering that post-15 August 2021, Pakistan geared its diplomacy for garnering regional and international consensus for constructive and sustained engagement with the new interim authorities in Afghanistan to avert a humanitarian catastrophe and an economic meltdown.\nHe also highlighted Pakistan’s effort including the establishment of the six-country format of immediate neighbors, participation in Moscow format, the Troika Plus Meeting held in Islamabad and above all the Extraordinary Session of the OIC Council of Foreign Ministers hosted by Pakistan in December 2021.\nHe said economic diplomacy had assumed higher priority in the conduct of Pakistan’s foreign policy.\nThis effort to promote and expand our trade and investment portfolio led to concrete achievements including: ​improvement by 39 points in Pakistans ranking in Ease of Doing Business, ​7% increase in trade with Africa, and ​an increase of over USD 2 billion in the export of information technology and IT-based sectors.\nUnder the digital reform agenda, Qureshi said Pakistan had launched the Foreign Minister’s Portal that provides the diaspora direct access to all 114 Pakistan Missions abroad based in 87 countries with a view to efficient handling and addressing of their issues.\nHe also mentioned the initiatives like Roshan Digital Accounts providing digital banking solutions Non-Resident Pakistanis and ‘Automation of Power of Attorney’, to resolve a perennial problem of overseas Pakistanis.\nApprising the audience of government’s Public Diplomacy initiative, Foreign Minister Qureshi said last year, the country celebrated 70 years of diplomatic relations with Argentina, China, Germany, Spain and Thailand. In 2022, the country would celebrate key milestones in friendships with UAE, US, UK and the EU.\nIn 2021, he said the foreign ministry also launched second FM Honours’ List, to recognize 25 bright Leaders under 40 from the overseas Pakistani community.\n“Pakistan is pursuing a proactive foreign policy with a focus on the global agenda. The future is unpredictable but we have the resilience and experience to deal with the challenges ahead,” Qureshi remarked.",
