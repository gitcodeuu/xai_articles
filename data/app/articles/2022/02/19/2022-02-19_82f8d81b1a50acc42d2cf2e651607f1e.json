  "content": "FAISALABAD, Feb 19 (APP): Special Assistant to Prime Minister for Political Communication, Dr Shahbaz Gill said on Saturday that workers were the real strength of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) and they would give a befitting defeat to the political opponents who were trying to protect the looters and plunderers.\nTalking to the media after condoling with a PTI worker over the death of his son in Madina Town here, he said, “Prime Minister has fulfilled his promise that no minister under his premiership will be involved in corruption and up till now no documentary proof of corruption has been submitted against any one of his ministers”.\nHe said that Imran Khan was one of the most serious leaders who had not interested in making money nor he had any peon like Malik Maqsood who was the handler of his ill-gotten money.\nHe said: “Our workers are fully aware of the fact that they have to spend from his own pocket to serve the masses or resolve their issues”. Most of the PTI workers belonged to the poor and middle class and hence they were most energetic, he said. The workers who had born with golden spoon in their mouth were never energetic, he added.\nHe said that PTI workers were now protecting Prime Minister Imran Khan in the public as they know whatever Imran Khan was doing his ultimate objective was to facilitate the poor masses.\nHe said that due to corona, the global economics faced a major meltdown and prices of different commodities recorded historic increase of 4 times but in Pakistan, only a minor portion of inflation was passed on to the people. “With the blessing of Allah Almighty and sincere efforts of Prime Minister Imran Khan, our GDP growth rate is at 5.37 percent”, he added.\nHe said that our opponents were perturbed over this achievement but they should remember the public gathering of Mandi Bahauddin where a crowd of millions gave a strong message that majority of people still supported their beloved leader Imran Khan.\nQuoting Shahbaz Sharif, he said that yesterday, he was upset due to the charge-sheet and he was using delaying tactics and started confrontation with the lawyers of FIA.\nHe said that Shahbaz Sharif looted and plundered Rs 16 billion through different bank accounts.\nThis modus operandi was originally introduced by Asif Ali Zardari and later Shahbaz Sharif and Hamza Shahbaz followed it, however, it would prove their political death, he opined.\nHe said that now there was no Malik Qayyum to give decisions of their own choice. Shahbaz Sharif has to go to jail as he cannot escape from his loot and plunder. He (Shahbaz Sharif) was saying that he intended to go to assembly. “We are waiting for him to give him a political response befitting to him”, Gill added.\nThe SAPM also criticized some TV channels which were not paying salaries to their workers and said that TV channels were earning hefty profit of 36 percent. Hence, they should give salary to their workers without any further delay otherwise, he would identify them by name if they failed to clear dues of their workers, he warned.\nHe said that opposition was making hue and cry that why Imran Khan dubbed Nawaz Sharif as “Bhagora” (absconder).\nHe said that the court had declared him as absconder and what we can say an absconder in Urdu except “Bhagora”. The government was also trying its optimum for the repatriation of Nawaz Sharif, he added.\nHe said that Shahbaz Sharif had presented a unique logic that FIA could not proceed against any private person, but the High Court on 23rd November had given a verdict that FIA could proceed against such elements.\nHe said, “Prime Minister Imran Khan has now stuffiest time as he has successfully controlled corona and saved the country from bankruptcy, now he is ready to face his political opponents with the help of its workers. He (PM) would not give any NRO and the looters would have to go to jail.\nThey should immediately return the ill-gotten money and surrender themselves to the courts, then they could enter into political arena if law allows them to do so, he added.\nDr Shahbaz Gill said the PTI workers should prepare themselves to give a befitting response to the political opponents as Imran Khan himself had jumped into the field.\nResponding to a question about looted money, he said, “We have retrieved Rs 550 billion and out of it, Rs 400 billion spent on the health cards which had made people millionaire. Now, it is the duty of people to think that who looted them and who had made them rich through transparent welfare policies”.\nHe said, if tax was collected judiciously, the country would definitely make progress. Hence, the government had decided to retrieve ill-gotten money from looters and plunderers and from this amount we will launch Ration Cards and Kisan Cards in addition to providing most of other facilities to the downtrodden, he added.\nHe hoped that people would stand righteous person as Islam clearly directed them to support for the right.\nResponding to yet another query, he said that Imran Khan was not afraid of ‘No Confidence Move’.\n“We are fully prepared and would foil all such conspiracies”, he added.\nAbout long march, he said that lofty claims of Rana Sanaullah and Shahbaz Sharif had no weight.\nThey could not stage a long march as the divergent political parties would skip one after another, he added.\nAbout a question to his participation in next elections, he said, “This decision will be made by Prime Minister Imran Khan that if I have to contest the elections or not, or from which constituency”.",
