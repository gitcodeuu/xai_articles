The land was given on a contract to a party during 1970.\nThe complainant had asked the lessee to vacate their land four years back, as they wanted to construct their residence, but on different pretexts, they did not return it back as it was overtaken by the land-grabbing mafia.\nAli has been living in Muscat, Oman and he posted a complaint on the PCP, which was immediately responded and his land was retrieved and returned to him.\nMuhammad Ali has expressed his satisfaction and pleasure over the effective functioning of the PCP.\nThe PCP has been addressing public complaints/issues on the directives of Prime Minister Imran Khan.",
