The winter kits were also being provided comprising quilts, pillows, blankets and other items so that they could be protected from the cold weather conditions.\nOn this occasion, Pak-Afghan Cooperation Forum Chairman Habibullah said the last year’s drought had exacerbated the plight of the Afghan people and if immediate and effective measures were not taken, the situation could turn into a humanitarian catastrophe.\nHe further added that MHI was one of the first international organizations to help the Afghan people in their time of need.",
