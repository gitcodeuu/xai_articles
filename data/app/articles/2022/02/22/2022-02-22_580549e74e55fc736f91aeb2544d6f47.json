According to the Federal Board of Revenue chairman, 13 of the cases are “the most important” as a large sum of money is involved,” he said after attending the high-level meeting with IHC Chief Justice Athar Minallah and and registrar.\nThe minister said it was a “remarkable” meeting as the suggestions given by the judiciary were “great”.\nChief Justice Athar Minallah, he said, “is among the best judges of Pakistan, who has taken a major step, which will contribute towards prosperity in the country, ” and hopefully the other courts would also follow suit.\nTo a query, the minister said most of the cases pending in the IHC were due to technical reasons on the part of FBR’s lawyers.\nHowever, the discussion on such matters between the government and the judiciary was imperative as the money involved in the cases belonged to the state and not an individual.\nFawad said he, after the last Federal Cabinet meeting, suggested a forum where the government and the judiciary could have exchanges for sorting out issues of national importance.\nThe IHC chief justice provided that forum where an extensive discussion was held in a “good” environment, he added.",
