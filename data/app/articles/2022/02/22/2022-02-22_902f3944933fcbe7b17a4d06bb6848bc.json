The PML-N could not provide evidence of dubious accounts of billions of rupees, he said adding that a huge amount was found in the accounts of Shehbaz Sharif.\nCriticizing the PPP regime, he said the PPP leaders had failed in resolving governance issues of Sindh. He said that both the political parties including PPP and PML-N, are playing on media and wasting time of the nation. He made it clear that PTI is determined to eradicate corruption from the society and for this, the corrupt leaders of PPP and PML-N, should go jail.\nHe said the PPP and PML-N had made massive corruption in the past. In reply to a question, he said PTI government would continue accountability process without discrimination. The corrupt leaders would face imprisonment due to money laundering cases, and Pakistan’s number in corruption index would definitely move down, he stated.",
