He said, India through such inhuman acts cannot stop Kashmiris from pursuing their struggle for freedom.\nHe said, the civilized nations of the world consider molestation against moral values ​​and disrespect to human dignity, however, contrary to this, the Indian authorities consider it a weapon to suppress voices of resistance and impose Hindutva Agenda.\nHe said, sufferings of lower-caste Hindus at the hands of high-caste Hindus was not any secret now, adding that Dalit  were subjected to different forms of social injustice and their women targeted.\nHe said, this Hindutva weapon (molestation) was being tested in Kashmir since 1990’s, however, such weapons could not deter Kashmiris, particularly women from freedom struggle.\nNaqash said Kashmiris were ready to render any sacrifice for achieving the goal of freedom, adding that continuing the mission of martyrs was national responsibility for Kashmiris.\nKashmiris will continue the mission of martyrs and are ready to render any sacrifice for achieving the goal of freedom from Indian occupation",
