Her own statement in which she denied ownership of any property was enough to implicate her in the case, he added.\nHer statement was negated by her own brother in an interview with the private channel in 2016 and admitted that the Sharif family owned four flats in London and Maryam Safdar was their beneficial owner, he said.\nHe said later the documents of a Panamanian law firm, Mossack Fonseca, confirmed that Maryam was the beneficial owner.\nThe minister lashed out at Maryam Safdar for constantly seeking adjournments in her case and asked her to produce solid evidence in the court for proving her innocence.\nHe said Maryam had produced a fake trust deed before the court in the Calibri font which was not in the market at that time.\nThe name of Sharif family should be written in a book of Gunnies World Record for inventing unprecedented ways of cheating, he added.\nFarrukh highlighted the ‘Sharif doctrine’ which was aimed at influencing the institutions through videos and audio leaks, in addition to bribing and using pressure tactics.\nHe warned that stern action would be taken against those who were involved in maligning the people on social media networking sites.\nHe accused Maryam of spearheading the campaigns launched at the social media for character assassination of the prime minister and first lady.\nThe minister said the PML-N had remained involved in character assassination of late Benazir Bhutto and Nusrat Bhutto for political mileage.\nHe also highlighted the initiatives of the present government to mitigate the inflation and provide relief to the masses. It included health card, Kamyab Pakistan, Kamyab Jawan, Ehsaas and others.\nHe said Founder of Microsoft Bill Gates had arrived in Pakistan to meet the prime minister and appreciated PM Imran Khan’s efforts for reforming the health sector.\nThose international leaders were visiting Pakistan who never came to Pakistan in the last several decades, he added.",
