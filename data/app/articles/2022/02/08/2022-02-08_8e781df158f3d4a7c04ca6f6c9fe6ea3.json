He was convicted in the 2001 Parliament attack case and awarded a death sentence, though he always denied plotting the attack, which left 14 dead, including five militants.\nThe Indian Supreme Court judgment acknowledged the evidence was circumstantial: But then, shockingly, it went on to say: “The incident, which resulted in heavy casualties, had shaken the entire nation, and the collective conscience of society will only be satisfied if capital punishment is awarded to the offender.”\nEvery year, on his martyrdom anniversary, a complete shutdown is observed in the IIOJK and protest demonstrations are held to demand the return of mortal remains of Afzal Guru.\nThe illegally detained All Parties Hurriyat Conference Chairman Masarrat Aalam Butt has said the Kashmiri people will observe February 9 and 11 as black days in protest against the hanging of two iconic Kashmiri leaders Muhammad Maqbool Butt and Muhammad Afzal Guru by India in New Delhi’s infamous Tihar jail for the sacred cause of freedom.\nAnother prominent Kashmir leader Mabqool Bhatt was hanged on February 11, 1984 in Tihar Jail by India.\nThe APHC spokesman in a statement issued in Srinagar said that both the martyrs infused a new spirit in the freedom movement of Kashmir.\nEven, the Sikh organization, Dal Khalsa President H S Dhami, while paying tributes to Muhammad Afzal Guru on the eve of his second martyrdom anniversary, in a statement in Amritsar criticized India for failing to hand over his mortal remains to his wife.\nThe martyrdom of Afzal Guru at the hands of India repressive state power is an international acknowledged living example of Indian actions to satisfy the blood thirsty Hindu extremists.\nSince 1990, Indian occupational forces have killed more than 100,000 innocent Kashmiris, more than 150,000 civilians have been arrested, 8500 killed in custody, 12,000 disappeared and 110,000 structures were destroyed. Hundreds of thousands injured with at least 7,000 with pellet injuries at the hands of Indian occupational forces.\nRape had been a primary weapon of the Indian army. Indian army has weaponized rape against Kashmiris. Estimates suggested that 8,000 to 11,500 Kashmiri women had been raped by Indian forces.\nSubstantial evidence of atrocities was contained in the first report ever issued by the United Nations on human rights in Kashmir. The report was released on 14 June 2018 by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\nThe Human Rights Review report on the situation of human rights IIOJK from January to December 2021 revealed 257 killings, 195 massive cordon and search operations, 130 residential houses bombed, 80 military operations, 163 freedom fighters killed, 48 Indian occupying forces killed in retaliation, and 46 civilians murdered by the occupying forces.",
