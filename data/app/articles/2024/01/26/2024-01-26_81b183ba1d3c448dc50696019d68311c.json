This legislation underscores Pakistan’s commitment to sustainable and responsible trade practices, ensuring the well-being of endangered species.\nCITES classifies its parties into three categories (Category I, Category II, and Category III) based on the consistency of their national legislation for implementing the Convention. Following an exhaustive review process, Pakistan’s legislation earned well-deserved recognition, ascending from Category II to the esteemed Category I.\nThis proclamation, declared during the 77th meeting of the CITES Standing Committee held on 8th November, 2023, is a resounding affirmation that Pakistan’s legislative measures meet the highest standards for the implementation of CITES.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
