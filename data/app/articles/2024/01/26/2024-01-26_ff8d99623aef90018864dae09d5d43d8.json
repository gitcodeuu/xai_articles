Qawwali is extremely popular throughout the country because of its soul-touching lyrics and rhythmic melodies, added the Ambassador.\nElaborating further, he said that when Qawwali was performed in a concert for international audiences who did not understand the lyrics, the driving rhythms became the focus of attention.\nBakhtyar Ali Santoo Qawwal from Lahore, Pakistan who enthralled and mesmerized the Parisian audience is among the leading Qawwals of the new generation and is known for his powerful performances.\nFrom his early childhood, he had a strong inclination, passion and interest in Qawwali as it gives a message of love, peace, respect and reverence.\nA large number of people including French officials and friends, diplomats, music lovers and media enjoyed the Qawwali.\nThe delicious traditional Pakistani cuisine was served to the guests which made the evening even more enjoyable.",
