The team had recovered some 796 active SIMs, 2 gateway exchanges (32 ports), 11 gateway exchanges (16 ports), 3 routers, and 4 network switches and apprehended an individual for further investigation.\nThe FIA team also confiscated active SIMs along with all devices as evidence, the news release added. The  PTA had lodged a complaint with FIA, prompting the action based on information about the illegal termination of international traffic bypassing legal gateway exchanges. These raids are part of PTA’s ongoing efforts to curb the circumvention of the Multi-Finger Biometric Verification System (MBVS).\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
