Dr. Jesse Reynolds from the DEGREES Initiative said that climate change was the most difficult challenge faced by international community that demanded dedicated scientific assets, capital and human resource to ward off adverse impacts of the global warming and environmental degradation.\nHe mentioned that his organisation was approaching international policy makers on SRM and solar geo-engineering as most its efforts were focussed on scientific research intended on managing climate risks.\nClara Botto of SRM Youth Watch, Italy (online) briefed the participants on emerging technology and its trends based on solar geo-engineering that demanded prudent and collaborative approach towards the SRM systems.\nThe session was followed by a survey on SRM by the CUI and DSG that aimed at focussing on the outcomes of the two-day international training seminar and gauged the knowledge of the participants on SRM.\nSpeaking on the ethical viewpoints for Pakistanis to consider in an SRM world, Dr. Ghulam Shabbir, CUI highlighted that the world was at the brink of major crisis due to nuclear arsenal and climate change, whereas the planet earth witnessed extinction of mankind for five times and it would be the sixth time which would be triggered due to mankind’s self-damaging techs.\nHe added that the race of progress had led to exacerbating damage to climate and environment risking human life to extinction on earth which needed a balance through moral and ethical values that could be found in religion.\nIn his vote of thanks by Chairman, Department of Meteorology, CUI, Dr Kalim Ullah extended his gratitude to the participants and felicitated the former Head of the Centre for Climate Research and Development (CCRD), CUI, Prof Dr Athar Hussain for holding the first successful international event on SRM.\nHe called the initiative was a great step that convened participants from diverse backgrounds to attend the training conference.  He thanked Hassaan Sipra, SRM Expert, DSG and Executive Director, DSG, Shuchi Talati for reaching from USA to participate in the conference.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
