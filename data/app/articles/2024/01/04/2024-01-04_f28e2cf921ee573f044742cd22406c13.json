This precautionary measure aimed to foster an environment where the focus remained on conveying policies and engaging with voters, rather than diverting attention towards potential project promises.\nAs the election fervor gains momentum, the significance of these guidelines cannot be overstated. The meeting served as a crucial milestone, equipping candidates with the knowledge necessary to conduct a campaign that not only resonated with the electorate but also adhered to the highest standards of ethical conduct.\nIn the pursuit of a democratic process that stands the test of scrutiny, the meeting underscored the shared responsibility of all participants by instilling a sense of accountability and transparency, the 2024 General Election is poised to be a testament to the integrity of the democratic values.",
