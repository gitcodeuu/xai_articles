It said the critics and human rights defenders faced arrests and raids based on spurious allegations and cited the illegal arrests of Kashmiri rights activists, Khurram Parvez and Irfan Mehraj.\nThe APHC spokesman in a statement in Srinagar said the Modi regime is trampling all basic rights of the Kashmiri people on a daily basis and employing draconian laws to stifle political dissent in occupied Kashmir. He maintained that the continued denial of the Kashmiris’ basic rights including right to self-determination by New Delhi was a violation of the UN charter and international laws.\nThe spokesman asked that how can India claim to be a democratic republic when it was denying the Kashmiris their basic rights. “India must be pressurized to stop persecution of rights activists and voices of dissent in the IIOJK. Modi and his henchmen must be held to account for trampling every right of the Kashmiris. World must wake up to take notice of the plight of oppressed Kashmiris,” he added.",
