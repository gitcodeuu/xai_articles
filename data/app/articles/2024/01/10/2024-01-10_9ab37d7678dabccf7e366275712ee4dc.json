Ebrahim being counsel instead of amicus and none object.”\nThe court said, “Khawaja Haris Ahmed was appointed as amicus but he has disclosed that his father was counsel in a contempt case of Masood Mahmood, who was co-accused/approver in the case, therefore, his name may be withdrawn as amicus.”\nThe order read, “Mr. Salahuddin Ahmed was appointed as amicus and discloses that he is married to the granddaughter of the murdered Nawab Ahmed Khan, therefore, if anyone objects to him being amicus he will withdraw. However, none present object to Salahuddin Ahmed appearing as amicus.\n“We commenced by hearing amicus Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan.
