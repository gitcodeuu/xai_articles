However, it is important to understand their impacts on the agriculture and food sectors.\nDr Suleri mentioned that in adverse weather scenarios services and manufacturing sectors can halt their services but the food and agriculture sectors will face irreversible impacts of crops and species loss due to shift in weather patterns.\nHe said, at the COP-28 moot, the FAO’s baby step of producing a report on food system sustainability underlined the target of 32 percent CO2 removal from the crop sector through different strategies which was a starting step but rather a positive one in the right direction.\nHe mentioned that the SDPI is conducting the dialogue as part of its series of efforts after its hackathon held before its flagship SDC conference in 2023 on food and agriculture with the support of the Canadian mission in Pakistan.\nThe UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), Representative in Pakistan, Florence Rolle said that climate change is real and could not be denied anymore, either the world recorded the first or second hottest year in its history. She added that Pakistan would have to adapt to climate change and extend effective incentives to its farmers in water conservation and crop productivity through alternative crops ensuring crop diversification.\nShe proposed that the country’s due to rising temperature variability could focus on early crop sowing that can help generate more produce with the available water and resources provided the growing shift in pattern.\nShe added that there was much scientific evidence on early crop sowing, however, the issue is that more production in\nthe cotton crop was witnessed in upper space. Rolle said there was a need to revisit the agriculture sector of Pakistan by farming systems and observe its weather patterns which will be the best combination of crop farmers and systems.\nFAO, she noted that was measuring the cost and affordability of the healthy diet, as it was no more hunger but access of people to a more diversified diet to remain healthy.\n“One billion people in the world cannot afford a healthy diet in the past years. The current agriculture food policy not providing the desired relief and it’s a window opportunity to revisit the policy,” she added.\nFlorence Rolle said there is an opportunity for Pakistan to improve the system and repurpose it to make out more opportunities. “There is also a need to look into public access to diversified food which is safe alongwith ensuring food security, and food control systems that can bring elements for dialogue and look into the potential of diet, export of the commodities,” she added.\nShe added that data is important and Pakistan has developed varieties of species related to crop products but lack of data should not be the excuse for adopting modern tech lying on the shelves.\nShe also highlighted the less availability of data, and governance as the major issues instead of collating of information to manage the crisis.\nCommenting on the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) she said it was not the solution but rather the part of the problem to ensure food security.\nProf. Dr Iqrar Ahmad Khan, VC, University of Agriculture Faisalabad said Pakistan had some 50-55 million acres of cropland whereas out of that 22 million acres cater for wheat and around 8-10 million acres for rice and almost 65%\nof the cropland is based on the wheat and rice system.\nHe added that the wheat and rice crops alone are taking away more than 70% of the water, and in the climate and crop correlation, rice is the biggest contributor to the CO2 emissions.\n“Wheat Cotton and Rice system for climate and food security options is an opportunity to diversify agricultural patterns.\nThe rice-wheat water usage can be reduced to half without compromising the yield target and wheat gains can be doubled if smaller farmers are benefitted to the available knowledge resource,” he said.\nHe mentioned that if the unexplored knowledge resource, helped achieve half of the potential in this regard then there could be ample room for other crops to grow like soyabean.\nHe mentioned that there was sufficient empirical evidence available to move away from puddle fields to DSR fields in rice cultivation as the latter grew under normal sowing conditions.\nDr Iqrar mentioned that the farmer’s biggest reluctance was their absorption capacity as a major chunk of the farmers comprised of small farmers. The shifting of rice needs mechanization which is not up to the mark and subject to the capacity of small farmers.\n“We have lots of illiterate media and people in the federal capital to be educated on GMOs,” he added.\nOne statement of the former Minister about GMO soyabean caused the poultry industry a major blow due to drop in poultry feed. “GMO is a solid science and its now more than 25 years for its commercial purposes as it has also matched the standards of Federal Drug Agency (FDA) of Washington,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
