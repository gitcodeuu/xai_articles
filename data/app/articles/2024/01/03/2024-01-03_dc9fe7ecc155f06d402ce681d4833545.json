His client had completed his education with the name of Muhammad Akhtar Khadim but he had been in politics with the name of Khadim Hussain.\nThe chief justice asked the lawyer to present any affidavit or document as evidence regarding change of name by the petitioner.\nThe court subsequently upheld the decision of high court and declared the disqualification as per law.\nIt may be mentioned here that Khadim Hussain was elected as MNA in 2008 from Pakistan Muslim League-Q.
