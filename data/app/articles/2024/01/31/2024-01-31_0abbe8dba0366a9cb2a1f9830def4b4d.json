  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 31 (APP): Learning, Acting, and Building for Rehabilitation in Health Systems (ReLAB-HS) has organized a two-day seminar to deliberate on the standardization of assistive technology (AT).\nThe event served as a vital platform for fostering discussion, promoting collaboration, and catalyzing policy initiatives in healthcare accessibility, particularly for rehabilitation and AT.\nHosted by ReLAB-HS, a five-year global activity funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the roundtable drew a diverse array of participants, including high-level representatives from government, policymakers, rehabilitation and health care professionals, industry representatives, advocacy experts, and faculty from Johns Hopkins University.\nThe primary objective of the event was to confront the challenges surrounding reimbursement policies and standardization practices in the provision of assistive products in Pakistan.\nFederal Director General of Health Dr. Muhammad Ahmed Kazi remarked this a great initiative, stating that Pakistan is already doing significant work to provide rehabilitation and AT services through social security schemes.\n“More work is needed to come up with a sustainable mechanism for widening the access to rehab and AT services and to lessen the burden on the government institutions.”\nHe thanked ReLAB-HS team and the stakeholders for sitting together to have discussion on this important subject.\nSpeaking at the occasion, Dr. Abdul Gafoor Bachani, Director of ReLAB-HS, highlighted that in Pakistan, 94% of AT users bear out-of-pocket expenses, presenting a barrier for many and indicating a significant unmet need for assistive products among individuals with functional limitations.\nDr. Bachani stressed the imperative of collaboration among governmental entities, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations to streamline reimbursement mechanisms for assistive products, which are presently convoluted and redundant.\nHe proposed that facilitating connections between individuals in need of assistive products and relevant organizations could alleviate the financial burden on health departments.\nDuring the discussions, the expert panels conducted thorough analyses of current reimbursement policies and standardization procedures for assistive products in Pakistan.\nParticipants shared insights, experiences, and recommendations to address existing gaps and enhance the overall landscape.\nReflecting on the significance of the initiative, Dr. Abdul Ghaffar, a Senior Advisor for ReLAB-HS, emphasized that the policy roundtable marked a pioneering effort in addressing challenges encountered by individuals reliant on assistive products.\n“By bringing together a diverse group of stakeholders, we have laid the groundwork for collaborative efforts to enhance reimbursement policies and standardization practices, ultimately improving access and quality of life for people in need of rehabilitation,” Dr. Ghaffar noted.\nDr. Zia Dawar, Global Coordinator and Country Coordinator for ReLAB-HS Pakistan, underscored the program’s collaborative efforts with federal and provincial governments to integrate rehabilitation and AT services into the health care system.\nHe highlighted ongoing engagements with the federal and provincial health authorities to develop strategic policy plans at both the federal and provincial levels.\nThe roundtable facilitated meaningful interactions among the key stakeholders, fostering collaboration among government authorities, health care providers, representatives of nongovernmental organizations, and advocacy practitioners.\nThe participants collectively formulated actionable policy recommendations aimed at enhancing reimbursement mechanisms and standardization processes for assistive products, which will be presented to relevant authorities to effect positive policy changes.",
