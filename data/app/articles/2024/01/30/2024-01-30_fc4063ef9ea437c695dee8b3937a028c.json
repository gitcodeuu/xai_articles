  "content": "FAISALABAD, Jan 30 (APP):Former Interior Minister/Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) Punjab President Rana Sanaullah Khan on Tuesday said the PML-N would form government at center and provincial level with heavy public mandate.\nAddressing a corner meeting during his election campaign in his constituency NA-100 (Faisalabad-VI) in Chak No.81-JB Panduri here, he said the PML-N was a pro-people party which always strived hard to save Pakistan from crises.\nHe said that Pakistan was making speedy progress during 2017 when under a calculated move, the PML-N government was ousted and an incompetent man was clamped on the nation. This man (PTI founder) divided the nation and promoted the culture of hate and hatred in addition to implicating his political opponents in false and fabricated cases. “A similar bogus case of heroin was also registered against me but it was never proved,” he added.\nHe said that due to ill-conceived policies of PTI government, the country plunged into deep economic crisis which resulted in uncontrolled inflation in the country and made the life of common man very miserable.\nHe said that the people should once again pose confidence in the leadership of PML-N and it would surely drag Pakistan out of prevailing crises as it saved the country from unprecedented load shedding and terrorism during 2013.\nHe said that at present the country was experiencing multifaceted problems but price hike was the major issue today. However, it was not a problem bigger than the terrorism, he added.\nHe said the PML-N government under dynamic leadership of Nawaz Sharif overcame the menace of terrorism which was rampant in the country during 2013. The PML-N would also resolve the problem of price hike on top priority basis after winning the General Election 2024, he added.\nHe asked the people to come out of their houses on 8th February and support the PML-N so that it could form its federal and provincial governments with thumping majority.\nHe also asked the area people to vote for him during the general election and assured them to redress their genuine problems on top priority basis.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
