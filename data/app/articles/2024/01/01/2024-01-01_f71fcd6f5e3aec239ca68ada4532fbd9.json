The aim of these exercises was to crystallize national response mechanism against oil spill disasters and contingent SAR requirements in collaboration with international partners, he added.\n“Exercise BARRACUDA-XII will provide the opportunity to review and align our response procedures to attain the shared objective of pristine marine environment and safety of life at sea”, he said.\n“The Exercise will also provide a forum in the shape of maritime seminar to deliberate on contemporary technological advancements and global best practices in the field of marine pollution control. The Exercise is set to reaffirm our national resolve and acknowledge the importance of oceans in our collective well-being and the need to protect and preserve them for our future generations.”\n“I am sure PMSA through Exercise BARRACUDA-XII will afford a valuable platform for the participants to exchange best practices, share experiences and learn from each other,” the CNS said.\nHe said : “The conduct of Exercise is a testament to our unwavering commitment and cooperation for enhancing maritime security, streamline SAR procedures and preserve marine environment in the North Arabian Sea.”\n“I wish PMSA and international and national participants, a worthy and rewarding outcome of the Exercise and a pleasant stay at Karachi,” he said.",
