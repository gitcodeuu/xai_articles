  "content": "LAHORE, Jan 01 (APP): Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar on Monday said that issue of Baloch families from Balochistan was being projected in negative and in sharp contrast to realities as Balochs were standing with the state of Pakistan.\nResponding to different media queries during his visit to Business Facilitation Center, the prime minister said that terrorists and armed militants had been involved in the killing of people of Balochistan. They were killing doctors, lawyers and teachers.\nHe reassured that the state would fight with them with all force as they could not be given license to kill people.\nThe prime minister, referring to criticism by a section of media, said that the government was not fighting with the Baloch families and regretted that efforts were made to spread confusion and mingle things together.\nThe issue of families of Balochs had been blown out of proportion, he said, adding that these terrorists had been taking money and funding from RAW and killing people in the province.\nThe caretaker prime minister said that about 90,000 people had been killed in the fight against terrorism but hardly any nine accused had been convicted so far.\nThe prime minister opined that the criminal justice system in the country required improvement.\nTo a question, he mentioned that there was no restriction on freedom of expression.\nReplying to another question regarding an alleged firing incident in DIKhan over vehicles of Maulana Fazlur Rehman Amir of JUI-F, he said that it was alarming, adding that the government was responding to security threats in the southern parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with all the available resources.\nThe caretaker prime minister said that all the resources and security apparatus would be utilized to ensure holding of peaceful polls on the election date and expressed the hope that they would be successful in this regard.",
