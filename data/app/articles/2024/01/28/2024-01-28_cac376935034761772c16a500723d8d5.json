He was one of the few distinguished voices and one of the most prominent poets of Pakistan.\nWarsi experimented with every genre of poetry including ghazal, nazam, naat, and hamd. Unique style and diversity of themes made Warsi prominent among the poets of his era. Warsi enlightened ‘Natia Poetry’ with a new style and Naats like “Ya Rahmatullah Al Alameen”  would always be remembered among people having a literary taste.\nHe received the pride of performance award from the government of Pakistan in 1988.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
