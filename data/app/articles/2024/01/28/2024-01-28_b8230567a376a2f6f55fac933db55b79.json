Today, on January 28, an additional 18 children have reportedly died from pneumonia.\nHealth experts attribute the rise in pneumonia cases in Punjab to the prevalent winter season and the resulting air pollution, especially smog. Smog, a consequence of air pollution, has been identified as a significant factor contributing to the spike in pneumonia cases.\nPneumonia, characterized by an infection in the lungs, is predominantly caused by viral infections, and its symptoms can appear after experiencing cold or flu. It can range from mild to severe, with young children, especially those under 5-year old, being more susceptible to the disease.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
