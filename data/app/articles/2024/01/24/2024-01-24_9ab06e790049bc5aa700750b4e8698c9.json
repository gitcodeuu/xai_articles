By the year 2026, the strategic plan aims to deliver a measurable improvement in the enforcement of child rights, making every effort that this promise is translated into impactful evidence-based actions by state entities and civil society.\nA key priority outlined in the strategic plan is the focus on evidence generation and knowledge.

We believe that the strategic priorities outlined – evidence and knowledge, partnership, and transformation – aligns with the global efforts to ensure every child’s well-being. This collaborative approach sets a positive precedent for effective child rights enforcement, and we look forward to witnessing the lasting impact of this strategic plan on the lives of children across the country.”\n“Prioritizing awareness, capacity building, and policy reform will transform the future of children in Pakistan.
