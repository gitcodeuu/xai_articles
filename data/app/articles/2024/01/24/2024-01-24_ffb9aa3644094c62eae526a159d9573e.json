Instead of leaving their profession, the women better work shoulder to shoulder with their men counterparts for the development of the country, he added.\nReferring to the Israeli atrocities being faced by the Gaza people, the president said that women were the most affected during the crisis.\nEarlier the president conferred awards on the women entrepreneurs for their services.\nLCCI President Kashif Anwar said unless the government did not give a suitable environment for women, they could not play their due role in trade and investment sectors.\nHe urged the Ministry of Commerce to provide maximum incentives to the women entrepreneurs for encouraging them to participate in business activities.\nHe also called upon the government to provide maximum tax subsidies to the women entrepreneurs.\nHe said the chamber was arranging trainings for the women to enable them sell their products across the world through various e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Ali Baba.",
