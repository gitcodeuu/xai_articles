  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jan 24 (APP): Caretaker Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue and Economic Affairs, Dr. Shamshad Akhtar Wednesday said that effective implementation of bold and ambitious reforms was imperative to usher in a new era of development and prosperity in the country.\nThe accomplishment of this goal, however, is contingent upon addressing critical underlying institutional, governance, and structural constraints, he said during a seminar on “Pakistan’s Economic Crisis: Challenges and the Way Forward,” organized by NUST Institute of Policy Studies (NIPS) at the University’s main campus here.\nDr. Shamshad Akhtar highlighted five key areas that have increased the vulnerability of Pakistan’s economy to domestic and global shocks.\nThe first area, he mentioned is unsustainable fiscal policy due to revenue gaps and unproductive expenditure; second, fiscal non-sustainability has enhanced government recourse to public debt which has increased; third, climate shocks as the global warming model predicts that Pakistan’s weather patterns would become even more volatile and extreme in the decades ahead, with an average increase in temperatures by 1.3 to 4.9 percent by 2090; fourth, the lack of innovation and diversity in the structure of the economy; and fifth, the failure to integrate Pakistan’s economy with the rest of the world.\nDr. Shamshad further stressed five critical areas of reforms essential to reducing Pakistan’s vulnerabilities and fostering sustainable growth that included: a comprehensive overhaul of the government’s fiscal apparatus necessary to lower the revenue-expenditure gap; addressing structural weaknesses of SOEs and improving their efficiency and functioning, reducing the debt burden; and enhancing competitiveness and encouraging new investments.\nDuring his talk in the second session of the seminar, the Caretaker Federal Minister of Energy, Power and Petroleum, Muhammad Ali talked about the energy crisis and energy sector reforms in Pakistan. Recognizing the interlinked nature of Pakistan’s power and energy challenges, the minister emphasized the need for comprehensive structural reforms as economic activity has collapsed due to import controls, creditworthiness downgrades and ballooning interest payments.\nHe said that a strategic approach was needed to meet the country’s energy requirements as Pakistan relies heavily on gas and oil as main sources of energy, while industries and transport consume the largest chunk of the energy produced.\nModerated by Dr. Ashfaque Hasan Khan, Director General NIPS, the event attracted diverse participation comprising senior policymakers, dignitaries, government officials, veteran diplomats, development professionals, economic experts, academics, think tank leaders, scholars and students. Lt Gen (Retd) Javed Mahmood Bukhari, Rector NUST also attended the seminar.\nDr Ashfaque also presented a comprehensive overview of Pakistan’s economic crisis. His insightful lecture provided a broad analysis for addressing the economic challenges faced by developing countries, like Pakistan, in managing their debt burdens. He emphasized the reduction in interest rates to reduce expenditure and bring the budget into sustainable balance.\nOther distinguished speakers included Sakib Sherani, CEO Macro Economic Insights, Prof Ather Maqsood from NUST and Dr Muhammad Khan from IIUI, who articulated key points bearing on good governance, political stability, consistent growth policies, innovation promotion, energy infrastructural overhaul, sustainable economic development, tax reforms, dialogue as a way out of political and decision-making deadlocks, resource indigenisation, reform of energy pricing and the restoration of investor confidence.",
