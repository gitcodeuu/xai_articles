  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP):The Centre for Peace and Development Initiatives (CPDI) has urgently appealed to the Chairman Senate, the speaker Punjab assembly and the speaker National assembly to address the rising incidence of Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, hypertension, and heart diseases through special initatives.\nIn a statement on Sunday, the Institute said these health issues are largely due to the unchecked consumption of unhealthy foods high in industrially produced trans-fatty acids (iTFAs), sodium, and sugar.\nThe scale of the problem is likely to rise monumentally in the near future if immediate measures to reduce the dietary risk factors and prevent the incidence of NCDs are not taken. The health sector experts agree that iTFAs, sodium, and sugar are major dietary risk factors for coronary heart disease, diabetes, cancers, hypertension, and premature deaths.\nIn its letters, CPDI calls for a dedicated session or at least a full day in the National Assembly to discuss the deteriorating public health situation. Public authorities must address lifestyle and diet-related risk factors for NCDs, including the high content of iTFAs, sodium, and sugar in the food supply.\nCPDI proposes the creation of a special committee to review existing laws and policies related to dietary risk factors for NCDs. This committee should include members with expertise in food and health-related matters and consult experts from both public and civil society sectors.\nCPDI urges a ban on serving unhealthy food items (especially sugary drinks and foods high in iTFAs, sodium, and sugar) during official meetings and functions within office premises. Cafeterias should also refrain from offering such items.\nMukhtar Ahmad Ali, Executive Director of CPDI, expressed the hope that “these measures will significantly and positively address the NCDs-related public health crisis in the country.” CPDI has formally requested a meeting with the Chairman Senate, speaker Punjab assembly and speaker National assembly to explain the research-based findings and the way forward for better governance of food systems in Pakistan.\n“Medical research shows that the national burden of diseases, deaths, and disabilities in Pakistan is changing, and we need to take serious measures to control dietary risk factors so that our healthcare system does not cave down and can provide quality healthcare services to the population”, Ali stated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
