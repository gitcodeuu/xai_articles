Our success in treating and separating conjoined twins is a testament to Saudi Arabia’s commitment to humanitarian aid and medical excellence,” he added.\nDr Naif said KSrelief, under the leadership and vision of King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud has been instrumental in these medical endeavors. He said the center has mobilized resources, expertise, and state-of-the-art facilities to ensure the highest standards of care for conjoined twins.\nDr Naif said in a landmark move inspired by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Nations has officially adopted November 24 of each year as “World Conjoined Twins Day.” He said this initiative, driven by the Kingdom’s remarkable humanitarian efforts, aims to raise awareness and support for conjoined twins worldwide.\nHe said World Conjoined Twins Day would serve as a platform to educate the public, support affected families, and encourage further advancements in medical research and treatment for conjoined twins.\nDr Naif expressed gratitude to the medical teams, support staff, and international partners who have contributed to this mission. He also acknowledged the continuous support from the Saudi government and the unwavering dedication of KSrelief in making these life-changing surgeries possible.\n“As Saudi Arabia celebrates this milestone, it looks forward to continuing its humanitarian mission and inspiring other nations to join in supporting and caring for conjoined twins around the world,” he maintained.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
