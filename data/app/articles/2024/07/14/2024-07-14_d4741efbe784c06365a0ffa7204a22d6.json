  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 14 (APP):Muharram-ul-Haram, the first month of the Islamic calendar, holds profound significance for Muslims worldwide as it marks the beginning of the Islamic New Year and is a period of deep reflection, mourning, and spiritual renewal.\nMuharram-ul-Haram is especially notable for the Day of Ashura, the 10th day of the month, which commemorates the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussain Razi Allah Anhu, the grandson of Prophet Muhammad Peace be Upon Him, at Karbala in 61 AH.\nIn light of the historical and spiritual importance of Muharram, religious scholars and leaders are urged to maintain peace and tranquility during this sacred month and beyond. The Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) has unveiled a comprehensive code of conduct for Muharram-ul-Haram, emphasizing the need for unity, respect, and adherence to Islamic principles.\nThe CII’s code of conduct outlines several key guidelines to ensure a peaceful and respectful observance of Muharram-ul-Haram. Religious leaders are encouraged to foster an environment of mutual respect and understanding, avoiding divisive rhetoric that could incite conflict.\nThe guidelines emphasize the sanctity of mosques, Imambargahs, and other religious sites. These places should be protected from any form of desecration or violence. Muharram processions, especially those on Ashura, should be conducted peacefully. Participants are urged to avoid provocative slogans or actions that could lead to unrest. The media is advised to play a constructive role by promoting messages of peace and avoiding sensationalism that could exacerbate tensions.\nThe code encourages cooperation between religious leaders and law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety and security of all observances during Muharram-ul-Haram.\nReligious scholars and leaders across the country have echoed the importance of following the CII’s code of conduct. In their sermons and public addresses, they have called for efforts to maintain peace and tranquility, not only during Muharram-ul-Haram but throughout the year.\nInternational Research Council for Religious Affairs (IRCRA) President Muhammad Israr Madani, in an exclusive talk with APP, said the month of Muharram-ul-Haram, with its themes of sacrifice and justice, offers an opportunity for introspection and recommitment to the values of compassion and tolerance. By adhering to the CII’s guidelines and fostering a spirit of mutual respect, he said the religious scholars and leaders can honor the legacy of Hazrat Imam Hussain Razi Allah Anhu and work towards a more harmonious and just society.\nThe IRCRA president said the significance of Muharram-ul-Haram transcends mere historical commemoration; it is a time for Muslims to reflect on the lessons of Karbala and to renew their commitment to justice and unity. He said the call from religious scholars and leaders to maintain peace and tranquility, reinforced by the CII’s code of conduct, is a vital step towards ensuring that the spirit of Muharram-ul-Haram inspires positive change in the people of all schools of thought.\nConcluding his remarks, Israr Madani asked to embrace these principles and strive for a future marked by harmony and understanding with the advent of Islamic New Year.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
