  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 14 (APP):National Conference (NC) leader Omar Abdullah on Sunday said that IIOJK deserves better than a powerless, rubber stamp unelected chief minister.\nIn a statement issued in Srinagar, he said that Modi wants to impose Hindutva rule in the occupied territory by enhancing powers of the Lt Governor, Kashmir Media Service reported.\nThe move of the Modi-led Indian government to give more powers to Indian illegally occupied Jammu and Kashmir Lt Governor is aimed at further dis-empowering Kashmiris.\nHe further said giving more powers to unelected LG is a clear attempt to undermine the future of democratically elected IIOJK government.\nIt said empowering unelected LG is another move of the Modi regime to systematically dis-empower Kashmiris post August 2019 when it repealed Kashmir’s special status and imposed military siege in the territory.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
