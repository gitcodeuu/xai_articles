It plays a critical role in maintaining healthy ecosystems, which in turn support local communities. Wildlife contributes to ecosystem services such as pollination, pest control, and soil fertility, all of which are vital for agriculture and food security.\nThe Senator reiterated the need for a collective and concerted effort of all segments of society in attainment of a collective national objective and fulfilment of a “National Responsibility” which being “A Thriving population of All Wildlife Species” to enlighten the Generations to come.”\nAshiq Ahmad Khan, wildlife expert and senior member of the committee,  said: this novel initiative aimed at recognizing and rewarding the outstanding efforts of our dedicated forest rangers. This programme underscores our commitment to protecting Pakistan’s forests and biodiversity and highlights the critical role that forest rangers play in this mission.\nHe said: Forest rangers are at the frontline of our efforts to combat illegal logging, poaching, and other activities that threaten our natural heritage. Their work is often dangerous and challenging, requiring a high level of dedication and courage. The Ranger Reward Programme is designed to acknowledge these sacrifices and provide tangible rewards for their exemplary service.\nThe Snow Leopard Foundation’s Director, Dr. Muhammad Ali Nawaz, emphasized, “Wildlife conservation is not just about protecting animals; it’s about safeguarding our future. As we face the challenges of climate change, the resilience of our ecosystems becomes increasingly important. By protecting wildlife, we are also protecting the resources that communities depend on.”\nHe said the Ministry of Climate Change and Environmental Coordination and the Snow Leopard Foundation remain committed to supporting wildlife conservation efforts and raising awareness about the importance of biodiversity. Together, we can build a sustainable and resilient future for both people and wildlife.\nWell-known environmentalist and Executive Director DevCom Munir Ahmed said: “The Pakistan Wildlife Protection Awards celebrate individuals and organizations that have made significant efforts in protecting the nation’s diverse wildlife. This year’s winners have demonstrated exceptional dedication to preserving various species and their habitats, thereby contributing to the ecological balance and sustainability of our environment.”\nHe said: In the context of climate change, protecting wildlife and their habitats is more important than ever. Healthy ecosystems act as buffers against extreme weather events and help regulate the climate by storing carbon. The preservation of biodiversity can also provide new opportunities for sustainable livelihoods, such as eco-tourism, which can benefit local economies.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
