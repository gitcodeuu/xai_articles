By 2025, the program aims to reach an additional 200,000 students and train 2,000 master trainers from public and private schools across Pakistan including Islamabad, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Sindh, Balochistan, Gilgit Baltistan.\nThis success underscores the power of collaboration in preparing young people for a brighter digital future. By equipping them with essential skills and promoting responsible digital citizenship, the program significantly contributes to narrowing Pakistan’s digital skills gap.\nExpressing optimism about Digital Safar, Aamir Ibrahim, CEO of Jazz, said, “We are committed to bridging the digital divide and ensuring online safety in Pakistan. By providing free internet access and devices, we ensure that every student can benefit from Digital Safar’s resources and acquire quality digital education. This initiative is a testament to our commitment to fostering digital literacy and skills among our youth and supporting the vision of Digital Pakistan.”\nDuring the event, Umar Farooq, CEO of Tech Valley, stated, “Our goal is to create a digitally literate Pakistan where students evolve from mere consumers of technology to innovative creators. The success of Digital Safar exemplifies the profound impact that strategic collaborations can have in realizing this vision.

Its comprehensive curriculum spans coding, computational thinking, digital citizenship, and online safety, tailored to diverse educational settings in Pakistan.\nThe program further enhances accessibility with self-paced Urdu learning videos, enabling teachers to overcome language barriers and accommodate varying schedules.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
