  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 03 (APP):Jazz’s mission to improve the lives and livelihoods of Pakistanis, especially women and children, through technology is the driving force behind its recent transformation from a conventional telecom company to a ServiceCo said Jazz CEO Aamir Ibrahim.\nIn a keynote address at an event , celebrating the achievements of the “Digital Safar” digital skills development program for schoolchildren, Ibrahim highlighted the significance of this transition.\nThe program, a collaboration between Jazz, Google, and Tech Valley, aims to equip young minds with essential digital skills.\nJazz announced its strategic transformation to a service company, shifting from a traditional mobile operator to a forward-thinking conglomerate with dedicated Strategic Business Units (SBUs) focused on innovation and growth. This move allows Jazz to continue delivering cutting-edge services to existing customers while exploring new sectors.\nIbrahim praised the “Digital Safar” program, which has already trained 1,000 teachers and 100,000 schoolchildren aged 8-14. He emphasized that this collaboration aligns perfectly with Jazz’s new digital services direction. Launched in 2023, the program aims to reach an additional 200,000 students and train 2,000 master trainers from public and private schools across Pakistan by 2025.\n“Equipping the young generation with the right skills and knowledge is crucial,” Ibrahim said. “We need to prepare our future generation to be competitive globally, not just in Pakistan.”\nHe added, “This success underscores the power of collaboration in preparing young people for a brighter digital future. By equipping them with essential skills and promoting responsible digital citizenship, the program significantly contributes to narrowing Pakistan’s digital skills gap.”\nIbrahim stressed the importance of technology as a great equalizer, reducing the gap between urban and rural areas, and between different socioeconomic groups. “Our ambition is to put a smartphone in every hand and a broadband connection in every home, school, hospital, and government office so everyone can access the opportunities available,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
