OICCI members contribute over one-third of Pakistan’s total tax revenue and are involved in 14 sectors of the economy.\nThey facilitate the transfer of technology and skills and provide employment to a significant number of people. About a third of OICCI member companies are listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange, and many are associates of Global Fortune 500 companies. OICCI members also engage in corporate social responsibility activities benefiting 46 million persons from underprivileged communities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
