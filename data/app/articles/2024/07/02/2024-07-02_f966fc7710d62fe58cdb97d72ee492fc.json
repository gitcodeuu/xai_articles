These tactics are clear signs to change the dynamics of the erstwhile state, he added,\nWani said that India was trying to change the religious landscape of IIOJK. He said that in 1990 there were around 490 Mandirs in IIOJK but now the Modi led Indian government was planning to construct around 50 thousand Mandirs for which funds and land had already been allocated.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
