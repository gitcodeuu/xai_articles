He anticipated that the full operationalization of Gwadar Port would provide Pakistan with significant revenue opportunities, particularly for transit trade to the Central Asian Republics (CARs).\nReflecting on the historical camaraderie between the two nations, Admiral Wijegunaratne recalled Sri Lanka’s steadfast support for Pakistan during critical junctures, including providing crucial logistical support during the 1971 war. He praised Pakistan’s assistance in combating insurgency in Sri Lanka, highlighting the provision of military hardware that helped in defeating the Tamil Tigers.\nEconomically, he noted the bilateral trade volume of approximately one billion dollars annually, with prospects to exceed this mark, emphasizing Pakistan’s exports to Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka’s potential to expand its exports to Pakistan. He also discussed Sri Lanka’s interest in boosting tourism between the two countries, noting challenges in air connectivity that hinder potential growth in this sector.\nOn educational and cultural exchanges, Admiral Ravindra highlighted initiatives such as the Allama Iqbal Scholarship, which supports Sri Lankan students studying in Pakistan. He mentioned Sri Lanka’s eagerness to collaborate with Pakistan in religious education and praised Pakistan’s hosting of the Gandhara Culture Symposium, emphasizing the cultural ties that could enhance tourism and mutual understanding.\nLooking ahead, Wijegunaratne discussed Sri Lanka’s recovery from economic challenges exacerbated by COVID-19, focusing on revitalizing tourism and improving agricultural productivity. He suggested Pakistan to negotiate debt restructuring with international lenders and leverage its diaspora to bolster foreign exchange reserves.\nAddressing regional challenges, the Sri Lankan envoy highlighted climate change as a potent threat to South Asia, stressing the need for collective action. He praised Pakistan’s efforts in addressing water security issues and emphasized the importance of environmental sustainability.\nIn conclusion, Admiral Wijegunaratne expressed optimism about the future of Pakistan-Sri Lanka relations, envisioning deeper economic integration and enhanced cooperation in regional and global forums.\nHe emphasized the mutual benefits of strategic partnerships and reaffirmed Sri Lanka’s commitment to furthering diplomatic, economic, and cultural ties with Pakistan.",
