The meeting commenced with a briefing on the working and performance of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST), said a press release.\nSenator Shibli Faraz commented on the inefficiency of the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA), suggesting that the ministry provide details of its policy and slow-paced implementations.\nThe committee members also noted the sluggish pace of implementation of the Institute for Research, Advocacy, and Development (IRADA) and suggested that the ministry share the IRADA policy with the committee members.\nFurthermore, the Secretary of MoST briefed the committee on the ministry’s core mandate, adding that there are five R&D organizations, namely the Pakistan Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (PCSIR), the Pakistan Council for Renewable Energy Technologies (PCRET), the National Institute of Electronics (NIE), the Council for Works and Housing Research (CWHR), and the National Institute of Oceanography (NIO).\nThe Secretary highlighted that Pakistan Council of Renew Energy Technologies (PCRET) is on the verge of shutting down due to various concerns, including lack of human resources and its inability to achieve productivity.\nSenator Shibli Faraz suggested strengthening their human resources rather than pursuing an exit strategy. While endorsing the point of view of Senator Shibli Faraz, the Chairman Senator Kamil Ali Agha emphasized the need to take care of employees in case any department is to be shut down. He also added that renewable energy is essential and the ministry must find skilled employees; shutting down departments would set us back by even 10 years.\nThe officials of MoST also briefed on the budgetary allocations granted to autonomous organizations within the ministry.\nIt was reported that a total of 14,411.072 million rupees has been granted to these organizations for the year 2024-2025, with the highest allocation of 4,137.928 million rupees going to PCSIR, followed by 158.556 million rupees to PCST.\nThe matter under sub-rule (6) of Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Senate, 2012, concerning the nominations of senators for the boards of governors, was also discussed in the meeting.\nSenator Syed Faisal Ali Subzwari was nominated as a member of the Advisory Council of the Pakistan Standards and Quality Control Authority (PSQCA), Senator Dost Muhammad Khan as a member of the Board of Governors of the Pakistan Halal Authority (PHA), Senator Saeed Ahmed Hashmi as a member of the Board of Governors of the Pakistan Council for Science and Technology (PCST), and Senator Mir Dostain Khan Domki as a member of the Senate of COMSATS University.
