These discussions focused on key drivers of Pakistan-U.S. ties; addressed contemporary challenges in the bilateral, regional, and global contexts; and identified opportunities for mutually beneficial relations, economic partnership, security cooperation, and regional dynamics.\nThe first session, chaired by Ambassador Tehmina Janjua, former Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, focused on Pakistan-U.S. bilateral relations.\nAmbassador Zamir Akram emphasized realism in the relationship, noting its cyclical nature driven by tactical interests and shaped by external factors. He highlighted the need for substantive engagement in trade and investment.\nAmbassador Robin Raphel, former senior U.S. Diplomat, praised efforts to stabilize the relationship through dialogues and visits, allowing for candid discussions on divergent issues. She called for enhancing economic opportunities and targeted U.S. assistance in areas like higher education, technology, and green energy.\nAmbassador Ali Jehangir Siddiqui, former Pakistan’s Ambassador to U.S., discussed the limited progress in Pakistan-U.S. relations over the past 15 years, emphasizing the importance of enhancing Pakistan’s criminal justice system and setting achievable goals to reduce ‘noise’ in – bilateral relations.\nVaseem Anvar, former President, American Business Forum, emphasized the need for a sustainable economic partnership, recommending strengthening diplomatic ties, improving infrastructure, and adopting technology to enhance supply chain management and reduce costs. The session concluded with a question and answer segment.\nIn the second session, Ambassador Mansoor Khan highlighted the evolving Pakistan-U.S.  bilateral relations over the past 75 years, noting historical support and shared challenges. He emphasized geo-economic initiatives like CASA 1000 and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the potential for mutual benefit.\nMosharraf Zaidi, prominent commentator, emphasized that Pakistan-U.S. bilateral relations should be de-hyphenated from Afghanistan, India, and China. Further, he stressed the need for Pakistan to diversify its foreign relations, notably with Japan and Italy, and leverage its strategic importance in Central Asia.\nMichael Kugelman, renowned U.S. expert at Woodrow Wilson Centre, noted the need for modest expectations in U.S.-Pakistan cooperation due to geopolitical non-alignments. He identified potential areas for collaboration, including Afghanistan, counterterrorism, and Central Asia connectivity projects.\nDr. Huma Baqai, prominent academic, highlighted the fluctuating nature of the 77-year-old relationship between Pakistan and the U.S., influenced by the rise of China and shifting U.S. priorities. She emphasized the need for a diplomatic approach and a strategy of “hedging” to maximize Pakistan’s geopolitical options.\nDr. Rabia Akhtar, Dean, Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Lahore, discussed the strategic complexities and challenges in Pakistan-U.S. relations amidst regional and global dynamics. She underscored the importance of mitigating escalation, enhancing multilateral trade, and adopting holistic security policies to ensure long-term stability.\nIn his remarks at the concluding session, Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed emphasized on recognizing new realities in the global order with a global shift from West to East and stressed that Pakistan must navigate this new order in line with its core interests.\nHe further noted historical events, including the Afghan Jihad and the war on terror and their impact on bilateral relations. Moving forward, both nations must learn from past mistakes. Pakistan should improve its relations with neighbouring countries like Afghanistan and Iran, while the U.S. must adjust its post-9/11 mindset. The ideological stance of viewing China as an enemy is unproductive. Future geopolitical shifts, as well as potential return of Donald Trump as U.S. President, could influence the dynamics of this partnership. Ultimately, Pakistan’s unique position makes it a vital partner for the U.S., as highlighted by President Ayub Khan’s quote emphasizing the economic and strategic importance of maintaining relations with both the U.S. and China.\nIn his remarks, Dr. Moeed Yusuf, Vice Chancellor BNU, stated that Pakistan sits at a critical crossroads geographically and must focus on economic security and positive interdependence with all states. He stressed the need for Pakistan and U.S. to address this issue moving forward.\nAmbassador Khalid Mahmood, Chairman Board of Governors ISSI, commended ISSI and BNU for holding a fruitful discussion on an important subject and emphasized the importance of building on the accomplishments of the U.S.-Pakistan partnership.\nHe concluded by noting that while the relationship has seen ups and downs, the potential for mutual benefit remains significant and must be pursued with dedication and strategic foresight.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
