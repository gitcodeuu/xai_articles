  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 11 (APP):Pakistan on Thursday reiterated its call for the Indian government to cease its campaign of extrajudicial killings and indiscriminate use of lethal force against the Kashmiri people in the Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir.\nForeign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch, at her press briefing, reaffirmed Pakistan’s commitment to provide political, diplomatic, and moral support to our Kashmiri people for the just and peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute in accordance with UN Security Council resolutions.\nShe told the media that the 93rd ‘Youm-e-Shuhada-e-Kashmir’ (Kashmir Martyrs Day) would be observed on July 13 to honor the martyrdom of 22 Kashmiris who sacrificed their lives in Srinagar in 1931, bravely facing the indiscriminate firing of Dogra forces under the former Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir.\n“We salute their courage, which ignited a determined movement for the rights and freedoms of the Kashmiri people and their right to self-determination. This movement continues to this day.”\nShe mentioned that akin to the Dogra forces, Indian forces have killed thousands of Kashmiris over recent decades simply for advocating their rights.\n“Burhan Muzaffar Wani, an iconic youth leader from Kashmir, was among the hundreds who fell victim to extrajudicial killings in IIOJK.His eighth martyrdom anniversary was observed on July 8th,” she remarked.\nCommenting on Israeli aggression, she said Pakistan strongly condemned this week’s indiscriminate attacks by Israeli occupation forces on four schools in Gaza, which resulted in the massacre of dozens of women and children seeking shelter there. These attacks are further evidence of Israel’s genocidal campaign against the people of Gaza.\nThe indiscriminate targeting of civilian populations and facilities is a grave violation of international law and constitutes war crimes.\nWith its latest actions, Israeli occupation forces have once again demonstrated their contempt for international law and the basic tenets of decency and acceptable international behaviour, she said.\nThese flagrant violations of international humanitarian law must not be permitted to become the new norm.\n“We call on the international community to take urgent measures to bring an immediate end to Israel’s campaign of terror and the genocidal campaign against the Palestinian people. The time has come to hold Israel accountable for its crimes and its flagrant violations of international humanitarian and human rights law.”\nShe told the media that Pakistan and Azerbaijan will engage in wide-ranging discussions on areas of mutual interest to further strengthen their bilateral strategic cooperation during the two-day official visit of President Ilham Aliyev of Azerbaijan.\nShe stated that President Ilham Aliyev arrived in Pakistan for a two-day official visit. Invited by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, President Aliyev will meet with both President Asif Ali Zardari and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif.\nShe stated that the fourth round of bilateral political consultations between Pakistan and Estonia took place in Islamabad last Wednesday (July 10). Ambassador Shafqat Ali Khan, Additional Foreign Secretary (Europe), led the Pakistan delegation, while Ambassador Kristi Karelsohn, Director General of the Department of Asia, the Pacific, Middle East, and Africa, headed the Estonian delegation.\nThe two sides expressed satisfaction over the trajectory of bilateral relations between Pakistan and Estonia and reaffirmed their commitment to further enhance bilateral engagement and dialogue. The two sides also extensively reviewed the ongoing bilateral cooperation and agreed to further intensify collaboration in trade and economy, information and digital technology and education.\nShe said that regional and global developments of mutual concern were also discussed. Both sides agreed to closely consult on all issues of mutual interest, including at various multilateral forums.\nDuring her visit to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Director General Karelsohn also called on Foreign Secretary Muhammad Syrus Sajjad Qazi.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
