  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 11 (APP): US Ambassador, Donald A. Blome, on Thursday congratulated 120 Pakistani students and scholars on receiving prestigious Fulbright scholarships to pursue Master’s and PhD programmes in the United States (US).\nThe group also included participants in the Fulbright Foreign Language Teaching Assistant Programme. The Fulbright Programme is the US government’s flagship academic exchange programme, and the Fulbright Programme in Pakistan is one of the largest in the world.\nSupported by the US government, Fulbright academic exchanges enable students to attend top-tier universities, advance groundbreaking research, share knowledge, and make global connections. To ensure departing students are well-equipped to navigate the academic landscape and immerse themselves in American culture, the United States Educational Foundation in Pakistan (USEFP) organized a two-day pre-departure orientation here.\n“You have made it through an incredibly competitive application process, and you should be proud of your achievement,” Ambassador Blome said. “I’m especially pleased to see such a diverse group of Fulbright participants here, representing the many geographical regions of Pakistan and different walks of life.”\nThis year’s cohort is embarking on their educational journey at 66 U.S. universities. They will study various disciplines, including health, education, computer sciences, environmental studies, and social sciences. The group includes 102 Master’s and 13 PhD students, as well as five Fulbright Foreign Language Teaching Assistant fellows. Women comprise 55 percent of the group, underscoring the programme’s commitment to gender equality. The Fulbright scholarship covers travel, living stipends, health insurance, and tuition for the entire period of study.\nThe Executive Director of USEFP, Rita Akhtar, welcomed the recipients and encouraged them to take full advantage of their time in the US. “The Fulbright scholarship is a life-changing opportunity that opens doors to world-class education and research opportunities. Through this programme, you will gain access to renowned faculty, cutting-edge facilities, and a diverse academic environment that encourages innovation and creativity. As important, you will make friendships that will last a lifetime and further people-to-people ties between our two countries.”\nThe Fulbright Programme in Pakistan is managed by USEFP, a binational commission established in 1950 by the governments of the US and Pakistan. Over 2,896 Pakistanis have received the Fulbright awards, contributing to finding solutions to shared international concerns.",
