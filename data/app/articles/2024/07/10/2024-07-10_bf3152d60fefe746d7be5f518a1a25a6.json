Exchanges also focused on the importance of ways to strengthen international and regional peace and security, respect for international law, and consistent application of the principles enshrined in the UN Charter.\nThe dialogue underscored the importance of enhancing people-to-people contacts, particularly between the academic and research communities of Pakistan and Estonia. The role of educational and cultural exchanges was also emphasized as a means to foster deeper understanding and cooperation.\nThe Estonian delegation is visiting Pakistan for the 4th round of Bilateral Political Consultations (BPC) between the two Foreign Ministries.",
