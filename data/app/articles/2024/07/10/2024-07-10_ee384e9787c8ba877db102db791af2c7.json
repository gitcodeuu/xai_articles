  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 10 (APP): Council of Islamic Ideology Chairman Dr Muhammad Raghib Hussain Naeemi on Wednesday addressed the ongoing discussions on social media regarding the issues and rulings related to marriage (Nikah), divorce (Talaq), and the waiting period (Iddah) in Islam.\nHe, in a statement, emphasized that the Quran and Sunnah had clearly and effectively outlined the principles and regulations concerning these matters.\nDr. Raghib pointed out that Islamic law (Sharia) had provided explicit boundaries and guidelines. He expressed concern over the inappropriate and unethical nature of the commentary being made on social media platforms regarding these sensitive topics.\nHe urged that any individual facing issues related to marriage, divorce, or Iddah should seek guidance from religious scholars and medical experts. “These are matters of Sharia, and engaging in baseless, irrelevant, and frivolous debates about them is inappropriate,” he added.\nDr. Naeemi also cautioned against the misuse of social media for spreading prejudice, ridicule, criticism, hatred, and violence, noting that such behavior is undoubtedly harmful to the nation’s security and well-being.",
