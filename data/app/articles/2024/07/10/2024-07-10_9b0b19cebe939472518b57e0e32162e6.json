Despite its potential, the first transport policy in the country was only formulated in 2018, aiming to provide safe, affordable, efficient, durable, and environmentally friendly transport.\nCurrently, Pakistan Railways was working towards self-reliance by increasing its market share from 8% to 30%, but financial constraints were hindering progress.\nThe Secretary noted that 95% of the railway budget was spent on pensions, pay, and fuel, leaving only 5% for maintenance. For the financial year 2024-25, the liabilities related to pensions amount would be around\nRs 62 billion.\nPakistan Railways has taken measures to minimize operational costs and requested the federal government to include railway pensioners in the national account.\nResponding to Senator Kamil Ali Agha’s query, the Secretary informed the committee that a double electric line did exist between Lahore and Lodhran but has unfortunately been dismantled.\nDiscussing the ML-1 project, the Secretary explained that ECNEC has approved the ML-1 upgradation project at a cost of around $6.68 billion.\nThe first phase will upgrade the railway track from Karachi to Multan, followed by the track from Multan to Peshawar in the next phase. The committee decided to hold an exclusive session on the ML-1 project and to visit the Islamabad and Lahore railway workshops to examine their performance.\nThe Committee directed that priority be given to expanding the rail network to enhance regional connectivity and maximize financial benefits. Additionally, the committee recommended creating a think tank to strategize future projects, taking into consideration future trends and climate changes, and presenting a report at the next meeting.\nThe Committee also directed that future focus should be on expanding the use of solar power, battery charging, and electric vehicles to reduce fuel consumption and effectively address environmental concerns.",
