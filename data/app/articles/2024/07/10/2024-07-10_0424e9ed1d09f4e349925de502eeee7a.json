  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 10 (APP): National Assembly Speaker Sardar Ayaz Sadiq and Deputy Speaker Syed Ghulam Mustafa Shah on Wednesday emphasized adopting inclusive approach for wider development and prosperity of nation.\nThey said introducing and implementing non-discriminatory policies to provide basic rights to all would lead Pakistan on the path of development.\nThey also emphasized taking proactive measures for addressing the challenge of over population. They expressed these views in their separate message on World Population Day, Which is commemorated around the globe with the theme “leave no one behind, count everyone”.\nThe speaker acknowledged the importance of addressing demographic challenges, ensuring equal access to family planning, and promoting gender equality to ensure a sustainable future.\nHe stressed that it is a collective responsibility to align development priorities with population growth and provide quality education, healthcare, and employment opportunities to the growing population.\nAyaz Sadiq also underscored the importance of increasing awareness and education among the masses, particularly in rural areas, to effectively tackle the issue of population growth. He stressed that by working together, we can ensure a brighter future for our generations to come and achieve sustainable economic growth, social prosperity, and environmental protection.\nThe speaker expressed his concern that the rapidly growing population is exerting immense pressure on Pakistan’s limited resources, infrastructure, and public services, and if left unchecked, it could lead to severe consequences, including food and water scarcity, unemployment, and social unrest.\nHe warned that the country’s healthcare, education, and housing systems are already overstretched, and the increasing population would further strain these services, compromising the quality of life for millions of Pakistanis.\nMoreover, the speaker noted that the population growth rate is also having a devastating impact on the environment, with increased pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity, ultimately threatening the very survival of the planet. He urged the need for swift and collective action to address this critical issue and ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.\nOn this occasion, the deputy speaker said the issue of population growth is a critical challenge that requires immediate attention and collective efforts to address. He emphasized that the rapid population growth rate is having far-reaching implications for the country’s economic development, poverty reduction, and social welfare.\nSyed Ghulam Mustafa stressed that it is imperative to ensure sustainable development and a prosperous future for generations to come, and this can be achieved by addressing population growth, improving access to quality education and healthcare, and promoting economic opportunities. He assured that the incumbent Parliament would provide full support to the government and relevant stakeholders in addressing this important issue.",
