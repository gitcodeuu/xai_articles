He further said that the armed forces had played a proactive role in earthquake disaster and flood havoc by providing relief to the masses.\nHe said that the government of Pakistan strongly condemned the incident of ransacking Pakistani Consulate in Germany. He said that those involved in this incident wanted confrontation between Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nTurning to the situation in Bannu, the federal minister said every political party has the right to protest, however, peace and economy should not be politicized. He strongly condemned targeting the state institutions in Bannu. He demanded formation of Joint investigation Team to probe into Bannu incident.\nHe said that the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) was doing nefarious and reprehensible politics of chaos and anarchy for their personal gains. He urged the political parties to refrain playing politics on law and order situation, terrorism and economic development issues.\nTo a query, the minister said in fact that he had vigorously raised voice against terrorism and subversive activities in the country.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
