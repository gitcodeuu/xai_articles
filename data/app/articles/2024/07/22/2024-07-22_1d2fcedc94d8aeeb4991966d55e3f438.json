  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 22 (APP): Pakistan on Monday welcomed the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Israel’s unlawful policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and called for its immediate and full implementation.\nIt said the ruling clearly established that Israel’s unlawful policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory were in breach of Israel’s obligation to respect the right of Palestinian people to self-determination.\n“Israel is under an obligation to end its unlawful occupation; cease its illegal settlement activities; and to make reparation for the damage caused,” it was asserted.\nThe ICJ had ruled on the “Legal Consequences arising from the Policies and Practices of Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem.”\n“It may be recalled that Pakistan had made a written submission to the ICJ on the case in July 2023, and later also shared a rejoinder with the Court. Pakistan also participated in the oral public hearing held by the ICJ on the case in February 2024. In its submissions to the ICJ, Pakistan reiterated its strong and unwavering support for the right to self-determination of the Palestinians and highlighted the illegality of the Israeli occupation,” Foreign Office Spokesperson, said in a press statement.\nThe spokesperson further said that they hoped that the Court’s ruling would be an important step towards ending the Israeli occupation, realization of the inalienable right of the Palestinians to self-determination, and creation of a viable, secure, contiguous and sovereign State of Palestine on the basis of the pre-1967 borders and with Al-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital.",
