The dedicated van stationed at the park offers a range of services, including fuel permits for domestic and commercial use, and streamlines processes for motor vehicle registration. The primary goal is to simplify and expedite these procedures for the convenience of the public.\nIn addition to vehicle-related tasks such as registration, transfer, and token tax payment, the mobile Facilitation Center provides services like issuing domicile certificates, birth certificates, power of attorney documents, international driving permits, and more.\nBy establishing this mobile unit, ICT endeavors to enhance accessibility to critical civic facilities directly within the community, ensuring that essential services are more convenient and readily available to residents.",
