  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 22 (APP): A webinar, titled Quranic Horizons of Ashoor to Zahoor: Foundations for Imam Mahdi’s Divine Governance” on Monday highlighted the significance of Imam Hussain’s (AS) sacrifices in the battle of Karbala and their profound connection to global Islamic values.\nDr. Nisar Hamdani, a renowned scholar, elaborated on how Imam Hussain’s (AS) courageous stance at Karbala embodies timeless principles of justice, compassion, and faith, aligning with the anticipated mission of Imam Mahdi.\nHosted by Tehran University’s Faculty of Theology, the event brought together scholars and researchers from various countries, offering a unified perspective on themes such as justice and human perfection (Kamaal-e-Insaan), as outlined in a news release.\nDr. Hamdani articulated a comprehensive framework categorizing human actions into four domains: self, others, other creatures, and God. He illustrated how Imam Hussain’s life exemplified a balanced commitment to these domains, setting a timeless example through his actions.\nKey Quranic verses, including Surah Al-Baqara (2:155), Surah At-Tawbah (9:111), and Surah Al-Fajr (89:27-30), were cited to underscore Imam Hussain’s (AS) adherence to divine guidance and the enduring relevance of these principles in contemporary society.\nFurthermore, Dr. Hamdani discussed six fundamental principles derived from Imam Hussain’s (AS) will to his brother Muhammad e Hanfia, emphasizing their importance for Imam Mahdi’s mission and the responsibilities of his followers. These principles encompassed the reform of the Ummah, promotion of good deeds, revival of Sunnah, resistance against oppression, migration for the sake of Allah, and Jihad in the path of Allah.\nThe webinar underscored the pivotal role of values such as justice, truth, and compassion in historical and modern contexts. Dr. Hamdani emphasized their crucial significance for those advocating justice, opposing tyranny, and anticipating the establishment of a just governance under Imam Mahdi and Jesus Christ.\nA distinguished scholar frequently invited by international universities, Dr. Hamdani urged educational institutions and researchers to revise their curricula to include a holistic approach to human development and ethical upbringing (tarbiyat). He proposed that his structured approach, the Divine Model of Human Action, could enrich academic discourse and deepen understanding of universal values.",
