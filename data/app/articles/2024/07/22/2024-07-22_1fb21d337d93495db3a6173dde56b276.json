  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 22 (APP): The NDMA’s National Emergencies Operation Center anticipated heavy to very heavy rainfall in the Jammu region over the next three days.\nAs a result, local nullahs in Narrowal and Sialkot, including Nullah Aik, Daik, and Palkhu, may become inundated, potentially leading to flash flooding, a news release said.\nThe NDMA has issued instructions to all relevant departments to take necessary precautions to mitigate the possible effects of flooding and extreme weather.\n“Flash floods can strike suddenly, catching people off guard. Population at risk is advised to avoid flood waters and find a safe location away from flood-prone areas. Even a mere six inches of moving water can knock you off your feet, and just one foot of moving water can sweep away a vehicle. Bridges can be hazardous during floods. Avoid crossing them if water is flowing rapidly,” a news release said.\nThe NDMA has launched the Pak NDMA Disaster Alert application, available on Google Play Store and iOS App Store, to provide timely alerts, advisories, and guidelines to the public.",
