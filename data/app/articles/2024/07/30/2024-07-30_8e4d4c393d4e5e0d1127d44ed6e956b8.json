These projects have included conservation of the shrine of Musa Pak Shaheed and the restoration of Hazrat Shah Shams Tabraiz.\n“The power of cultural preservation work extends far beyond individual sites and projects – as historically important and visually impressive as they are,” DCM Schofer said adding, “These US-funded projects spur economic development in Pakistan, engage local communities, foster respect for cultural diversity, and strengthen our US-Pakistan partnership.”",
