  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 21 (APP): To commemorate the International Moon Day marked on July 20, the Space and Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) has arranged a Lunar Astrophotography Contest for astrophotographers across the country.\nAn official of SUPARCO told on Sunday that the contest was held under the theme “Illuminating the Shadows”.\nThe astrography enthusiast from across the country submitted geotagged images with their name and location as well as time when picture was taken to become the part of the contest by July 21 (12:00 am).\nThe contest was arranged by the Space Education and Awareness Drive (SEAD), an initiative under the ambit of SUPARCO’s Space Education and Awareness Programme to enthuse students and the general public through activities, competitions and space news.\nAs per the rules, the official conveyed, the participants retain the ownership of their images but grant the competition organizers the right to use the images for promotional purposes.\nAny image found to be plagiarized, heavily edited or not taken in July 2024 will be disqualified.\nThe results of the competition will be compiled on July 22 after receiving all the lunar images from the participants.\nAccording to the SUPARCO, the International Moon Day is an annual event, held for the general public and celebrated across the world like in Pakistan.\nThe International Moon Day is a good opportunity to educate the public, promote and raise awareness on the status and prospects for humanity. The major goals behind celebrating this day are sustainable moon exploration and utilization of the moon as well as highlighting the need to collaborate and regulate activities on and around the moon.\nThis celebration fosters increased global cooperation between stakeholders all around the world, as well as promote participation for future generations, the SUPARCO said.\nThe International Moon Day marks the anniversary of the first landing by humans on the Moon as part of the Apollo 11 lunar mission.\nThe General Assembly declared International Moon Day, a United Nations-designated international day to be observed annually on 20 July, in its resolution on “International cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space” in 2021.\nAccording to the United Nations, for thousands of years, human civilizations have looked up to the sky pondering the origin and mysteries of the Moon-our only natural satellite.\nGround-based observations enabled by the invention of the first telescopes opened a new chapter in our understanding of our celestial companion.\nWith the birth of space activities, the moon became the ultimate destination of countless missions, including crewed flights that brought the first human footprints to another place in the universe.\nAs moon exploration efforts continue taking shape with ambitious plans, this global celebration will serve not only as a reminder of success in the past, but as an annual testimony to future endeavours.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
