The event was organized by WWF-Pakistan here, a news release said.\nAccording to the report, an average Pakistani household spends around 50 per cent of their monthly income on food, making them particularly vulnerable to shocks including high food prices. It also indicated that Pakistan has the highest rate of malnutrition in the South Asian region. The report recommends that employing place-based approach, actions may be taken to transform our food systems.\nAgriculture being the biggest employing sector, supports Pakistan’s economy and addresses food security challenges. However, this sector did not improve during the last three decades and was adversely impacted by climate change, urbanization and population growth”, it said.\nThe report revealed that crop yields over the recent years have suffered from water availability issues which are expected to worsen over the coming decades. It also warned that rising population and warmer temperatures resulting from climate change will affect the agriculture sector. The report recommended steps for transformation of the food system in Pakistan which can be achieved through improvement of natural resource management, enhancement of governance models, promotion of scientific knowledge and increase in public awareness and re-direction of agriculture related subsidies. It further proposed that large improvements in supply chains and transportation systems are required to reduce food losses and waste which will help ensure food safety and improve production quality.\nThe one-day multi-stakeholder workshop aimed to foster a comprehensive dialogue on the transformation of food systems in Pakistan, strengthening national, sub-national goals and international commitments.\nHammad Naqi Khan, Director General, WWF-Pakistan in his remarks said that Pakistan is primarily an agrarian economy, but food security is increasingly becoming a concern due to increasing population and climate change vulnerabilities. He highlighted the role WWF-Pakistan in creating more sustainable food systems and livelihoods. He further mentioned that report provided key insights into transforming food systems to ensure food security and mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change.\nSpeaking at the workshop, Dr. Saleem Mohsen, Food Commissioner, Ministry of Food Security and Research, government of Pakistan in his opening remarks, appreciated the launch of the report. He said that it was pivotal to investigate the intricacies of food systems, particularly within the context of Pakistan. “We must learn from global best practices and must understand the need for localisation of initiatives to resolve local issues”, he added.\nMuhammad Ali Kemal, Chief Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Ministry of Planning, Development and Special Initiatives, in his keynote address emphasized that achieving sustainable food systems was not only crucial for addressing hunger but should be prioritized for promoting economic growth and combating climate change. Despite the current progress in agriculture, 37 percent of the country’s population is food insecure. We need a multi-faceted approach that improves agricultural practices, addresses technological challenges, improves agricultural policies and enhance supply chain management to transform our food systems, he added.\nAsad Imran, Director Food and Markets, WWF-Pakistan informed that approximately 100,000 farmers from Punjab and Sindh have been trained to adopt climate-smart agriculture. Moreover, he gave an overview of the incoming initiative on Regenerative Production Landscape in Pakistan, which aims to unite stakeholders for a common vision to co-create and work for climate change and landscape resilience.",
