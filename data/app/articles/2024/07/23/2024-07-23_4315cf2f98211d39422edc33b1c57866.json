However, the total reserves of oil are approximately 192.93 million barrels, and gas reserves are about 18,108.77 BCF.\nAccording to the 2023-24 data (as of May 2024), Sindh holds the highest share of gas at 64%, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has a 42% share in oil. Secretary Petroleum Division Momin Agha highlighted that of the total 3,200 MM CFT of gas, 200 MM CFT is used for production, 1,400 MM CFT by fertilizer and power companies, and the remaining 1,600 MM CFT for domestic purposes, making the total available gas 3,000 MM CFT.\nThe Committee recommended that complete details of gas consumption by provinces relative to their production be submitted at the next meeting.\nThe Committee also discussed development initiatives undertaken by gas companies to uplift less developed areas adjacent to gas sites.\nOfficials informed that the ministry has mandated oil and gas companies to spend a minimum of $30,000 on social welfare projects, primarily for clean water, education, and healthcare. The amount allocated for social welfare is directly related to oil and gas reserves.\nSenator Umer Farooq directed that details of social work done by oil and gas companies in different parts of the country over the last three years under Corporate Social Responsibility be provided.\nThe Committee was briefed by the MDs of Sui Southern Gas (SSGPL) and Sui Northern Gas (SNGPL) on their operations and performance.\nThe MD of SSGPL reported that the primary role of SSGPL is the transmission, distribution, and sale of natural gas, serving approximately 3.2 million customers. He added that SSGPL sources its supply from 11 sites on the left bank of the Indus and 8 sites on the right bank.\nHowever, indigenous gas reserves are depleting by 10% annually. The MD of SNGPL informed the Committee that SNGPL serves 7.4 million customers and earned a profit of around 10.37 billion in 2022 after tax.\nThe Committee decided to have an exclusive briefing on Reko Diq at the next meeting.\nThe meeting was attended by Senators Rana Mehmood ul Hassan, Sardar Muhammad Umer Gorgaij, Mir Dostain Khan Domki, Raja Nasir Abbas, Haji Hidayatullah Khan, and Mohammad Abdul Qadir.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
