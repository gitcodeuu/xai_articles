  "content": "LAHORE, Jul 23 (APP):A Lahore High Court (LHC) division bench on Tuesday issued notices to the prosecution and others on a petition filed by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) founder challenging his 10-day physical remand in 12 cases related to the May 9 riots.\nThe bench also sought details of cases against the PTI founder, besides summoning the prosecutor general of Punjab and the advocate general of Punjab for July 24.\nThe bench, comprising Justice Tariq Saleem Sheikh and Justice Anwaarul Haq Pannun, heard the petition filed by the PTI founder. His counsel argued before the bench that an anti-terrorism court had illegally granted a 10-day physical remand of his client in 12 cases related to the May 9 riots, as he was not physically produced in the court for obtaining the remand.\nHe further submitted that the physical presence of the accused was mandatory as per law so that he could present his case before the court. He pleaded with the court to declare the PTI founder’s remand illegal.\nSubsequently, the bench issued notices to the prosecution and others and sought their reply by July 24. On July 15, an anti-terrorism court (ATC) granted police a 10-day physical remand of the PTI founder in 12 cases related to the May 9 riots. He has been remanded in five cases registered at Sarwar Road police station, three cases at Gulberg police station, and one case each at Race Course, Shadman, Mughalpura, and Model Town police stations.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
