Dar said on the sidelines of the Commonwealth foreign ministers meeting in September, he would engage with the participating counterparts.\nIn her remarks, Secretary-General Patricia Scotland lauded Pakistan’s continued support of the Commonwealth particularly during her eight-year term.\nShe told the media that she was visiting Pakistan to see and celebrate the way Pakistan had arisen from the devastating floods of 2022 that had affected more than 33 million Pakistanis with two million of them lost homes and livelihoods.\nThe secretary-general appreciated Pakistan’s commitment to the Commonwealth principles as the organisation strived for a digitized and AI-enabled world.\nShe said that 65% of Pakistan’s population under age 30 would not just be the leaders of tomorrow but would also help the Commonwealth create a better future.\nTo a question, Deputy Prime Minister Dar said that Pakistan continued to uphold values like peace and development through dialogue and respecting independence and sovereignty. Pakistan sees the Commonwealth as a forum to forge consensus on pressing issues, he added.\nHe said that owing to its geostrategic location, Pakistan envisioned itself as a regional hub for trade as regional connectivity would create jobs for young people and create conditions for win-win cooperation. He also appreciated Secretary-General Patricia Scotland’s vision of increasing intra-Commonwealth trade to US$2 trillion by 2030.\nResponding to a query, the secretary-general said the Commonwealth consisted of 2.7 billion people or one-third of the world.
