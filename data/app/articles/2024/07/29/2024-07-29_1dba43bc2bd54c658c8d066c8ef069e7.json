  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 29 (APP): Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) Chairman, Dr. Raghib Hussain Naeemi on Monday declared that labeling an individual as deserving of death is both un-Islamic and illegal.\nHe, in a video statement, emphasized that such emotional actions harm the cause of the Finality of Prophethood.\nDr. Raghib said Pakistan, as a constitutional and Islamic state, has established punishments for all types of crimes within its legal framework, administered through the courts. “No individual, group, or mob has the religious or legal authority to set up courts and issue Fatwas (religious decrees) or orders for someone’s death,” he added.\nDr. Raghib said the council has repeatedly stressed that incitement, declarations of apostasy, and threats to government, state officials, or ordinary citizens contradict the clear teachings of the Holy Quran and Sunnah.\nHe said the unanimous statement of the “Paigham-e-Pakistan” national narrative, endorsed by esteemed religious scholars and leadrs of all sects, established that it is the duty of Ulema and Muftis to provide religious awareness and the correct Islamic solutions to issues. However, he said determining whether someone has committed blasphemy or uttered words of disbelief falls within the jurisdiction of the state, government, and courts.\nDr. Raghib said if anyone disagrees with the recent Supreme Court verdict, they can discuss it in an intellectual manner, as the council has previously expressed its scholarly and reasoned dissent on such matters.\nHe said in its 212th meeting held on November 27, 2018, the council resolved that the practice of issuing Fatwas of apostasy and declaring individuals as deserving of death is not aligned with Islamic principles.\n“In an Islamic state like Pakistan, no one is allowed to pass judgments on others’ beliefs and religion based on personal interpretations and issue Fatwas for their death. This matter requires utmost caution and careful handling,” he maintained.",
