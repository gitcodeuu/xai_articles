  "content": "ISLAMABAD, July 29 (APP): Iranian Ambassador Dr Reza Amiri Moghadam on Monday praised the BRICS alliance’s initiative to establish a new transaction messaging system aimed at bypassing traditional payment mechanisms as the world is now closer to de-dollarization than ever before.\nHe, in a statement, emphasized that the creation of this new financial messaging system would provide more variety for economic activists and enable the region to reshape the global trade landscape. He pointed out that this variety was essential and a hallmark of economic multilateralism.\n“Pakistan’s inclusion in BRICS, as an influential regional and international player, will be another turning point, further strengthening the BRICS alliance,” he added.\nDr Moghadam expressed optimism that this development would contribute to a more balanced and equitable global economic order, benefiting all member states and promoting sustainable economic growth.",
