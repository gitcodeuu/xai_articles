Given the reason, the country has put forward proposals for increased support to enhance resilience in vulnerable communities and sectors, such as agriculture and water management with increased focus on adaptation measures in the resource-poor countries like Pakistan.\nWhile highlighting the country’s mitigation measures, the PM’s climate aide said that the country would also apprise the global community at the COP29 that while Pakistan’s carbon footprint is relatively small compared to some other countries, it is already making efforts to cut its climate altering carbon emissions as a responsible nation by increasing its use of renewable energy, promoting e-vehicles and mass transit system, increasing forest cover, adopting smart farming techniques.\nShe also pressed on need for highlighting that the country would also advocate for greater international cooperation and fair climate finance. The country stresses the need for developed nations to fulfill their financial commitments to support developing countries in their climate action efforts.\nEarlier, PM’s climate aide said that the follow-up COP29 preparation committee meetings will held weekly for consultative sessions with sector experts, including representatives from various relevant ministries, organizations and provinces.\nSecretaries from ministries of climate change, Finance Division, Planning Development and Special Initiatives, Economic Affairs Division, Foreign Affairs Division, Executive Director of SDPI Abid Suleri, Salman Ahmed of Mckinsey & Company, Additional Secretary Ministry of climate change, Joint Secretary from PM’s office and other members of the committee from different government and non-governmental organizations attended the meeting.",
