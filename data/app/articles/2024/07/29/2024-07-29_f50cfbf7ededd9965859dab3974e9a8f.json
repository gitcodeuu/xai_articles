The country’s major reservoirs have attained 63.38 per cent of their capacity, with 36.62 per cent space still available to absorb any peak discharge.\nAccording to Flood Forecasting Division (FFD) Lahore, a strong Westerly Wave is currently over Northern Afghanistan with a seasonal low over Northwestern Balochistan. Yesterday’s well-marked monsoon low over eastern Madhya Pradesh (India) has moved Westward, converted into a monsoon low and is now over central Madhya Pradesh. There is a possibility of interaction between Westerly Wave and monsoon winds from Monday to Thursday, likely to strengthen further this week. Moderate moist currents from both the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal are penetrating into the upper parts of Pakistan upto 5000 feet.\nWidespread thunderstorm rain of moderate to heavy intensity with scattered very heavy falls and isolated extremely heavy rainfall over Islamabad, Punjab (Rawalpindi, Sargodha, Gujranwala, Lahore and D G Khan Divisions) and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa including upper catchments of all majors rivers are expected during the next 24 hours.",
