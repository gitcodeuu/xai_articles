  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 29 (APP):All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) has vehemently rejected the Indian government’s attempts to alter the demographic landscape of Indian occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK).\nThe APHC spokesperson, Advocate Abdul Rashid Minhas in a statement in Sriangar stated that Kashmiris will never accept the illegal changes imposed by the BJP regime on August 5, 2019.\nMinhas accused the BJP government of employing Israeli tactics to suppress the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination. He highlighted the regime’s brutal actions, including attaching properties, suspending government services, and settling non-locals in IIOJK to alter its Muslim-majority status.\nThe APHC spokesperson emphasized that these measures aim to erase the Muslim character of Kashmir and render Kashmiris homeless in their own land. He condemned the use of draconian laws like the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) as political vendetta.\nMinhas also criticized the BJP regime’s deprivation of Kashmiris’ access to local resources and business, stating that these actions will not be accepted.\nThe APHC urged the international community to take notice of India’s brutal actions in IIOJK, which violate international norms, and pressure India to preserve Kashmiris’ identity and implement UN resolutions.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
