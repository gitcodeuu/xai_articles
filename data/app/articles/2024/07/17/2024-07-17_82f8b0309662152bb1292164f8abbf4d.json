  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP): In a major operation at Islamabad Airport, the FIA safely recovered two missing children upon their arrival from Bishkek, and the the placement of newly introduced INTERPOL’s Integrated Border Management System (IBMS) was appreciated by the aggrieved family.\nThis significant achievement marks a pivotal moment in enhancing airport security and combating international child abduction cases, the FIA spokesman said while talking to APP on Wednesday.\nThe FIA spokesman said, under the newly established INTERPOL system IBMS, Islamabad Airport witnessed a crucial rescue operation initiated by the FIA (Federal Investigation Agency). The children, Mohammed Haseefa and Ahmed Amees Abid, who had been reported missing by Punjab Police and registered under a case at Burki police station in Lahore, were successfully located upon their arrival.\nThis operation highlighted the seamless coordination between INTERPOL Islamabad and FIA Immigration Islamabad, facilitated by the system’s advanced capabilities. The system, which linked the emigration database with INTERPOL’s global database, proved instrumental in identifying missing children, as well as tracking stolen passports and apprehending suspects wanted for serious crimes worldwide.\nThe implementation of the INTERPOL Find System earlier this year marked a significant milestone in Pakistan’s efforts to bolster airport security and combat transnational crime. Director General FIA, Ahmed Ishaq Jahangir, commended the team for their swift action and effective collaboration, emphasizing the system’s role in ensuring prompt responses to international alerts.\n“This successful operation underscores the critical importance of our enhanced border security measures,” stated a spokesperson from FIA. “By leveraging INTERPOL’s advanced tools, we can now swiftly identify and intercept individuals linked to global criminal activities upon their entry into Pakistan.”\nThe children, upon being taken into custody, were promptly handed over to the local authorities, reflecting the coordinated efforts between law enforcement agencies to ensure the safety and well-being of minors involved in such sensitive cases. The seamless integration of technology and operational expertise played a pivotal role in the operation’s success, setting a precedent for future collaborations in combating cross-border crimes.\nThe FIA remained committed to further strengthening its partnership with INTERPOL and other international agencies to expand the reach and efficacy of the newly implemented system.\nThe recent recovery of missing children at Islamabad Airport showed commitment to leveraging advanced technology in enhancing national security and responding effectively to international law enforcement challenges. As efforts continue to evolve, the integration of INTERPOL systems promised to play a pivotal role in safeguarding communities and ensuring justice for victims of transnational crimes worldwide, he added.",
