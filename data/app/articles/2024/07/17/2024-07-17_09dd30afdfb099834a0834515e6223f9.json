  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 17 (APP): The deputy head of mission at the Afghan Embassy in Islamabad was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday, to receive Pakistan’s strong protest over a militant attack at an army cantonment this week, which resulted in the martyrdom of eight soldiers and injuring several others, said the Foreign Office.\nThe terrorist attack was carried out by the Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group based in Afghanistan. Hafiz Gul Bahadur Group, along with Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of civilians and law enforcement officials in multiple terrorist attacks inside Pakistan.\nAccording to the Foreign Office, Pakistan reiterated its serious concerns over the presence of terror outfits inside Afghanistan that continue to threaten Pakistan’s security. Such incidents also go against the spirit of bilateral relations between the two brotherly countries.\nThe Interim Afghan Government was urged to fully investigate and take immediate, robust and effective action against the perpetrators of the Bannu attack and to prevent the recurrence of such attacks against Pakistan using the territory of Afghanistan.\nThe Bannu Cantonment attack is yet another reminder of the serious threat posed by terrorism to regional peace and security. Pakistan reiterates the call for decisive action against terrorism and remains steadfast in its commitment to combat this menace and to uphold its security against all threats.",
