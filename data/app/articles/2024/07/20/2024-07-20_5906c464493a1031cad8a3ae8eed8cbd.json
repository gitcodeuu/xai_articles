He warned that India’s ultra-nationalistic approach was aggravating mistrust among the nuclear states, with negative repercussions for the fragile strategic environment obtaining in the region.\nDuring a vibrant Q & A session, while elaborating on Indo-US cooperation, Ambassador Akram noted that India — leveraging US cooperation — was adopting a more aggressive stance, as evident by Balakot incident and revocation of Articles 370 and 35-A in IIOJK, while pretending to be a net security provider in the region.\nHe noted that it was in response to India’s belligerent approach that Pakistan was forced to adopt a Full Spectrum Deterrence (FSD) to ensure credibility of deterrence between the two states.\nAmbassador Akram also emphasized the importance of avoiding miscalculations in a sensitive security environment in South Asia and reiterated Pakistan’s dedication to maintaining credible deterrence essential for upholding peace in the region, which necessitates embracing education in science and technology to stay abreast of the latest advancements in technology.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
