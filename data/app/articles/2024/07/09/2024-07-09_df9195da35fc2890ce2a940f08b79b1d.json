To address this issue, the government is\nentering into a Rs. 2.8 billion agreement with foreign pharmaceutical companies.\nMinister Tarar said that cancer treatment is very expensive and noted that most of the funding is coming from international pharmaceutical companies.\nHe informed lawmakers that the prime minister has directed the removal of all obstacles within the health department to ensure funds for free cancer treatment are provided.",
