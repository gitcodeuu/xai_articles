He said that Jamiat Ulema e Islam (JUI-F) was also given reserved seats of minorities.\nThe Chief Justice inquired that whether only Sunni community was entitled to join the SIC to which the lawyer said that every Muslim individual could join it.\nFaisal Siddiqui said that 30 reserved seats were given in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly in 2024. He said PML-N won two seats in KPK and given five reserved seats against it.\nHe said that whether a party with 18 general seats should be given 30 reserved seats.\nAddressing the lawyer, Chief Justice Qazi Faez Isa said : “According to your logic, you should get zero seats because SIC did not win any seat.” The CJP said “You are giving arguments in the case of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) but arguing against yourself.”\nFaisal Siddiqui said that the reserved seats should be given to SIC which was in Parliament.\nJustice Athar Minallah remarked that it was important to make the elections transparent. “The situation is that a major political party got the vote which was excluded from the electoral process,” he said, adding “It is not about the political party but about the people’s right to vote.”\nJustice Athar Minallah said that Hamid Raza was PTI’s nominee before the decision of the bat symbol, adding that the ECP misinterpreted the verdict, which led to the controversy.\nSalman Akram Raja, the lawyer of independents, argued that the candidates associated with PTI were declared as independent. He claimed that the ECP didn’t present the complete documents to the court.\nThe lawyer said that the independent candidates joined the SIC within three days after which the SIC became a parliamentary party. He said that the ECP told the candidates that the PTI tickets would not be accepted after which the ticket of PTI Nazriati was submitted. “We had no other option,” he said.\nHe said “We wanted to give the people the right to vote for whichever party they want.”\nThe CJP remarked that first the candidate gave a declaration of PTI Nazriati, then PTI and now they were asking to join the SIC. “Tell us which party you belong to,” he questioned.\nSalman Akram Raja Advocate said that Kanwal Shuzab was from PTI and would join the SIC.\nAfter the lawyers concluded their arguments, the court reserved its judgment into the case.",
