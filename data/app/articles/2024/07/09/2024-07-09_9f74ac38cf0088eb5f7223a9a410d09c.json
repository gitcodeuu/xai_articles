  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 09 (APP):Chairman of the Prime Minister Youth Programme (PMYP) Rana Mashhood Ahmed Khan on Tuesday said that parenting plays a vital role in the nation-building process.\nAddressing at the ceremony “The Art of Parenting” here at the Pakistan National Council of Arts, he said that unfortunately we experienced the lack of youth training in our lives and youth comprise 65 per cent of the population, need special care and healthy activities to glorify country’s name.\nHe appreciated the role of the Agha Khan Foundation, Rotary Club and other institutions in creating awareness about parenting and the mindset of children and bringing awareness to the right parenting.\nChairman PMYP said that the government was taking revolutionary steps in various fields including sports, education, technical education, arts and culture, and others to empower youth through several initiatives.\nHe said that Pakistan has a talented youth and has a pivotal role in advancing the country towards fast-paced development.\n“We are dedicated to preparing our youth to excel in diverse fields, from technology-driven industries to traditional crafts. This holistic approach will enable them to contribute meaningfully to Pakistan’s socio-economic development,” he added.\nThe event aimed to empower parents and caregivers with effective strategies for raising children in a confident, creative and compassionate manner.\nAccording to UNICEF, “Positive Parenting is not restricted to a method, a set of rules, or a style; it is a belief, a way of living. Children should be treated with respect, free from fear of violence and shame, and guided with loving.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
