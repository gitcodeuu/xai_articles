  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 27 (APP):Defense Minister Khawaja Asif Saturday said that ongoing sit-ins and protests were driven by personal interests rather than national welfare.\nTalking to a private news channel, he said a party claimed to be on hunger strike but was not genuinely dedicated, often returning home after a few hours. The defense minister also criticized the nature of the protests, describing them as symbolic and lacking people’s support.\nThe Minister said there is a broader conspiracy to destabilize Pakistan, particularly in terms of its economic progress, which he claims threatens both internal and external interests.\nAcknowledging the impact of recent budgetary measures on inflation, he was confident that the economic and political situation would stabilize in the coming months.\nHe criticized the previous government of PTI for economic mismanagement, suggesting that recovery from this period would take time.\nRegarding the political climate, he said that he does not foresee an immediate path to new elections.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
