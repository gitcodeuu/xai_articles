  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 12 (APP): Minister for Information, Broadcasting, Culture and National Heritage Attaullah Tarar on Friday said the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) should better confess its blunders, instead of maligning the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) in a matter related to the reserved seats in the Parliament.\nRejecting the PTI’s propaganda against the ECP, the minister said it was the PTI which failed to hold intra-party election in accordance with the law. Likewise, the party had not submitted declaration and party tickets to the concerned, he added.\nHe, in a news statement, said the PTI also failed to join any party which had presence in the Parliament.\n“In this case, they did not request to be declared as MNA of the PTI,” he added.\nAfter all these blunders, he said the PTI did not have the right to question the ECP’s credibility.\nIronically, it was portrayed that all in the country were guilty except the PTI, he added.",
