He said that in late April or early May, there was a meeting with the Chief Justice regarding the Judicial Commission in which he stated that he was not interested in extending the tenure.\nThe law minister said that there is a genuine case of Article 6 against leaders of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf leaders as the constitution was violated by dissolving the assemblies in the presence of a no-confidence motion.\nAzam Nazeer said that the issue of the application of Article 6 on PTI leaders could be brought to the Parliament for debate.
