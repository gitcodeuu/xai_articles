In case of any power theft, tripping, power failure, or defective meters, automated intimation would be received in the data centre with instructions to the concerned SDO for rectification in a short time.\nThe consumers will also be able to control their electricity bills by monitoring their electricity consumption daily through a mobile application, he remarked.\nTo a question, the CEO said that the system has capacity of 5 million connections and currently IESCO has around 3.8 million consumers and we have still 1 million consumer space in the system.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
