  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 4 (APP):The Capital Development Authority (CDA) has sealed 60 buildings in the federal capital during a crackdown against the violations of the bylaws of the authority.\nDuring the crackdown against unauthorized constructions, the Building Control Wing, alongside the Enforcement Directorate, sealed 38 buildings in G-9/4 due to non-conforming use, said a press release.\nIn Gulberg Residencia, 22 under-construction buildings were sealed for proceeding without the necessary permissions.\nThe authority has issued notices to the owners of the sealed properties. Prior to this action, the owners were directed to obtain the required permissions from the CDA before beginning construction.\nThe buildings were sealed because the owners failed to comply with these instructions.\nChairman CDA Muhammad Ali Randhawa reiterated the authority’s commitment to enforcing building bylaws throughout Islamabad, stating that the crackdown on violations will continue consistently.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
