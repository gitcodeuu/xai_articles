He reiterated Pakistan’s image as a peace-loving state, wherein its people are a victim of terrorism, and at the same time have contributed immensely to the global community.\nSenator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, praised IPRI’s dedication, leading to its position as one of the major pillars among think tanks of the Global South, but more significantly, in the world.\nHe was of the view that intellectualism in today’s world is all about “battle of ideas,” and remarked that the dynamics of power politics are shifting and it is high time Pakistan choreographed its vision for a better and progressive tomorrow.\nSenator Mushahid underscored Pakistan’s history and the challenges when it became the first Muslim nuclear power in the world, and narrated the trial and tribulations that went at that moment. He was of the view that Pakistan made a strategic choice by going nuclear, and rightly called the Indian bluff by elevating itself as a détente power.\nSenator Mushahid noted that the way forward is to be on the same page as a nation-state and eulogise the tangibles in a forward-looking manner.\nThe seasoned parliamentarian said that Pakistan’s foreign relations should be evenly poised, and it is high time it becomes part and parcel of the evolving multilateralism, especially BRICS, wherein China and developing states are leading from the front.\nEarlier, President IPRI Ambassador Dr. Raza Muhammad emphasized the significance of think tanks in Pakistan’s history and synthesizing efforts of all institutes for the betterment of Pakistan. He highlighted IPRI’s wide footprint on the world with its policy research, which led to IPRI being ranked as the 74th think tank among the University of Pennsylvania’s global think tank rankings.\nHe reiterated IPRI’s vision of spearheading a qualitative change in the research and policy industry through data, innovation and technology, focusing on all facets of national security.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
