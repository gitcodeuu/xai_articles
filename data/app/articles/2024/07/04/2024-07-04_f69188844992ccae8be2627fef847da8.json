The international community should speed up its efforts for an immediate ceasefire and access of humanitarian aid in Gaza.\nPakistan’s position was that all long-standing disputes should be resolved according to the United Nations resolutions, he added.\nPM Shehbaz deplored that around 37,000 innocent people had been martyred in Palestine – most of whom were women and children, while over two million Palestinians were displaced by Israel.\n“Pakistan is in favour of a two-state solution to the Palestinian issue on the lines of pre-1967 borders with the establishment of a Palestinian state with Al-Quds as its capital,” he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
