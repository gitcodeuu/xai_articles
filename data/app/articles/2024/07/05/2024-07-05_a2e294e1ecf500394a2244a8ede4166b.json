He said the PMDC in response to his request, had agreed to accommodate all those medical students from Palestine in the medical collages under PMDC’s administrative control for completion of their education. “Palestinian students will come to Pakistan in 20 to 30 batches for completion of their medical education which is very humble contribution of Pakistan” said Ishaq Dar.\nThe foreign minister said the stance of Pakistan’s government on Gaza is very clear and Pakistan approached all available forums to promote its stance on Gaza.
