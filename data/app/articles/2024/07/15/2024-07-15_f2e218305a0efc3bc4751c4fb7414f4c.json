May 9 was an example of PTI’s anti-state policies,” he lamented.\nThe leader of the PML-N said that sometimes there were talks of burning and sometimes closing Pakistan, seeds of hatred were sown in the country, adding that today we say no more, we got this country in a destabilizing condition, and the economy was derailed during PTI’s four-year tenure.\nHe further said that if PTI’s agenda was political, then they would not have dissolved their assemblies.
