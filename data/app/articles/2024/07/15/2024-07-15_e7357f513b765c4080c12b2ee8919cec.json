  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP):To mark World Youth Skills Day, celebrated annually on July 15, the National Vocational and Technical Training Commission (NAVTTC) has launched a comprehensive social media campaign to raise awareness about the value and importance of skill education.\nRecognizing the impact of mainstream media in spreading this vital message, Ms. Gulmina Bilal Ahmad, Chairperson NAVTTC, appeared on PTV News’ morning show “Subh e Pakistan.”\nDuring her appearance, she discussed NAVTTC’s courses, and enrollment procedures, and emphasized the importance of skill learning, urging parents to encourage their children to acquire skills, which she referred to as “the currency of the future.”\nFollowing this, NAVTTC hosted a media briefing chaired by Ms. Gulmina Bilal Ahmad, which was attended by the Director General (Accreditation), Director General (Planning and Development), and other key staff members.\nDuring the briefing, the Chairperson outlined NAVTTC’s initiatives and recent measures taken to enhance the transparency of the commission’s programs.\nShe stated, “With new measures such as biometric attendance, CCTV surveillance, and third-party monitoring by leading M&E firms, I am certain there are no fake institutes. If anyone can point out even a single fake institute, NAVTTC is ready to take full responsibility.”\nMs. Ahmad also highlighted the Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) initiative, an important program offered by NAVTTC that certifies informally trained skilled workers in the country.\nShe noted that NAVTTC has certified over 49,000 individuals through this program, recognizing their skills that would otherwise go unacknowledged.\nRepresentatives from prominent media outlets attended the briefing, where Ms Gulmina announced the upcoming skills competition, which will initially be held at the provincial level and later scaled to the national level.\nMs Gulmina also took the opportunity to thank local industry partners for their interest and collaboration with NAVTTC.\nShe highlighted recent job fairs hosted in partnership with the industry and announced an upcoming job fair in KP.\nEmphasizing the importance of industry involvement, she stated, “The industry is our customer; we are producing resources for them. They must be involved in curriculum and training design. Therefore, we have recently ensured industry engagement.”\nAddressing a question about the challenges of overlapping functions with TEVTAs, Chairperson NAVTTC informed the audience about the National TVET Coordination Committee, formed under the directives of SIFC.\nShe added that the forum provides a platform to address challenges faced by the TVET sector in the country by improving coordination. So far, two meetings of the committee have been held, both of which were immensely fruitful.\nIn the end, the Chairperson shared her continued commitment to promoting the Prime Minister of Pakistan’s vision of skill education that meets international standards and needs. She urged the media fraternity to partner with NAVTTC in spreading this message, stating, “You can not only relay information from us to the masses but also pass on the youth’s voice to us.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
