  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 15 (APP): Adviser to the Prime Minister on Political Affairs, Rana Sanaullah, on Monday said that the Prime Minister has expressed his unwavering commitment to enforcing tax laws.\nSpeaking on a private news channel, he said that the prime minister showed resolute commitment and issued strict instructions to enforcing tax laws during a recent meeting focused on the economy and taxation.\n“The prime minister said that tax laws are designed to address the country’s economic challenges and must be implemented without exception,” he said adding, “there will be no turning back, even if he has to resign.”\nHe clarified that the prime minister’s statement was purely about economic and tax issues and not related to the current political scenario. He reiterated the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz’s (PML-N) readiness for dialogue, even in the face of adversity.\n“When the entire party of the PMLN was jailed on false charges, we were in favor of negotiations even then. Today, while in government, we are still willing to negotiate for the broader interest of the country,” he said.\nHe accused the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI) of deliberately creating chaos and spreading hatred to weaken the country. “They aim to use turmoil for political gain and harm the country,” he added.\nHe further said that the government will continue to work tirelessly to provide relief to the people of Pakistan.",
