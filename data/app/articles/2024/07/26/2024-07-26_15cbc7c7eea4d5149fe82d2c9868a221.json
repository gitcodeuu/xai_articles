  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 26 (APP):Pakistan has denounced Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s confrontational remarks made on July 26, 2024, in Drass, Ladakh, asserting that such statements damage regional peace and impede the resolution of the Kashmir conflict.\nBravado and jingoism undermine regional peace, and are totally counter-productive for resolution of long-standing disputes between Pakistan and India, especially the core dispute of Jammu and Kashmir, said a press release issued by foreign office spokesperson.\nThe Indian leaders’ rhetorical statements cannot deflect international attention from India’s heavy-handed approach to suppress the Kashmiri people’s just struggle for realization of their fundamental rights and freedoms, particularly their inalienable right to self-determination.\nInstead of maligning others for terrorism, India should reflect on its own campaign of orchestrating targeted assassinations, subversion and terrorism in foreign territories.\nPakistan stands resolute in its intent and ability to safeguard its sovereignty against any aggression, as exemplified by its robust response to India’s reckless incursion in February 2019.\nWhile Pakistan is ready to counter India’s aggressive actions, it remains committed to promoting peace and stability in the region.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
