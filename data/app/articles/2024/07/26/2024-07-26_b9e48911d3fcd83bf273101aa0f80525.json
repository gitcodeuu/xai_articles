Inflation had been brought down to 11 per cent, stock exchange witnessing highest activity in the last couple of months with all the economic indicators on upward trajectory, he added.\nTarar regretted a halt on the country’s development during the tenure of the PTI government which was led by a “corrupt person” who borrowed money massively and benefited himself and his close aides by selling Toshakhana gifts and striking a shady deal worth 190 million pounds.\n“We understand the issues faced by the chief minister of KP as on the one hand, he has to assure cooperation in official meetings while on other side, he was answerable to the PTI founder on maintaining a (specific) public posture,” he said\nReferring to the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), he said those who allegedly resettled Taliban in the country should come up with a plan in accordance with their claims of having a capacity to maintain the law and order and establishing the writ in the province.\nHe regretted that the terrorism was increased during the tenure of the PTI government.\nThe minister asked the PTI leadership in KP to give their stance to the public on two big scandals including massive deforestation and signing of agreements with a “fake institution” on the Artificial Intelligence.\nDemanding action against the timber mafia, he alleged involvement of a minister of the KP government and its officials in the massive deforestation.\nAs regards the signing of an agreement between the KP government and an institution for training of the students on the AI, he said they were playing with the future of students who would never get jobs due to fake certification.\nHe said the staff associated with the “fake institution” lacked required experience and awarded their staff with their own degrees on the subject.\nNo staff of the institution had a proper certification on AI either, he said, adding there was no record found regarding a degree claimed by its head from the MIT.\nHe regretted that no process was followed for signing the agreement wondering how the KP government could befool thousands of students in the name of a “so-called quantum diploma”.\n“This is a serious issue and must be investigated officially,” the minister said, asking the KP CM why he failed to comment on these issues in today public gathering.\nTo a query, he said a person involved in creating a deep fake video of a female leader of the PML-N had been traced and the investigating agencies were probing further in this regard.\nA threat from the KP government were mere political statements, he responded to another query.\nHe took a dig at the PTI’s so-called hunger strike that began after lunch and ended before dinner.",
