The number of protected consumers increased in winter due to less electricity consumption but its numbers decreased in summer owing to high consumption, he added.\nHe said due to Eid-ul-Adha holidays, the billing of one batch of June 24 was definitely affected but its billing was not done over 30 days to avoid inconvenience for the consumers.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
