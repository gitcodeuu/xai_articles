The goal is to build local capacities and integrate anticipatory action protocols into government DRM plans to enhance resilience against climate-related shocks.\nExperts from around the world will present at the forum, discussing new methods like the South Asia Drought Monitoring System (SADMS) and Earth-observation-based drought indices tailored for Pakistan’s agriculture. These presentations aim to improve decision-making for practitioners and guide humanitarian efforts in anticipatory action for drought preparedness.\nThe discussions will also cover the use of dynamic vulnerability indicators and satellite data to improve predictive accuracy and inform timely humanitarian responses.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
