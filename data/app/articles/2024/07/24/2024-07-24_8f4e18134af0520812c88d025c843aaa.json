According to the United Nations, for thousands of years, human civilizations have looked up to the sky pondering the origin and mysteries of the Moon-our only natural satellite. Ground-based observations enabled by the invention of the first telescopes opened a new chapter in our understanding of our celestial companion.\nWith the birth of space activities, the moon became the ultimate destination of countless missions, including crewed flights that brought the first human footprints to another place in the universe.\nAs moon exploration efforts continue taking shape with ambitious plans, this global celebration will serve not only as a reminder of success in the past, but as an annual testimony to future endeavours.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
