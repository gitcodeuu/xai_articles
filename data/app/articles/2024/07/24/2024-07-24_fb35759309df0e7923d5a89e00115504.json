  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP): A major initiative worth $9.8 million has been greenlit to tackle extreme climate events in Pakistan’s Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province.\nThis project, funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF), will be led by the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) in partnership with the Government of Pakistan.\nThe project aims to improve the public sector’s ability to forecast floods and take preemptive actions. It will provide rural households with tools to diversify their income sources and achieve financial stability.\nThe initiative also focuses on enhancing climate information services, helping communities prepare for flash floods with better risk information and local planning.\nOver 1.6 million people in vulnerable areas will benefit from improved climate services and an early warning system. New automated weather and hydrometeorological stations will be set up in Buner and Shangla districts.\nThese stations will offer tailored crop management advice, help reduce harmful coping strategies during floods, and involve local entrepreneurs and the private sector.\nWFP Pakistan’s Country Director, Coco Ushiyama, welcomed the GCF’s support, highlighting the importance of financing for accelerating climate action. She noted that climate change poses a severe threat but also calls for collective efforts to build a resilient and food-secure future.\nThis project will support ongoing climate resilience efforts in Pakistan by addressing gaps in early warning systems and community engagement. It includes strategies to support marginalized groups, especially women and persons with disabilities, ensuring they have access to climate resilience measures.\nThe project focuses on building institutional capacity, transferring knowledge, and ensuring long-term sustainability. It marks a significant step forward and could serve as a model for similar initiatives in other climate-vulnerable regions worldwide.\nThe GCF Board approved the project during its 39th meeting in Songdo, South Korea, on July 18.",
