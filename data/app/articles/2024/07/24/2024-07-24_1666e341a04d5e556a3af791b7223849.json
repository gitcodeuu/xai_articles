This number is projected to rise to 43.3 million by 2050. Recognizing this demographic shift, the Islamabad Capital Territory Senior Citizen Act was enacted in 2021.\nThe Older People Rights Network (OPRN), Islamabad, is a coalition of over 15 civil society organizations dedicated to advocating for the rights of older people and persons with disabilities. Established in December 2023 and supported by HelpAge International, the network serves as a platform for dialogue, collaboration, and policy advocacy. It involves stakeholders such as ministries, parliamentarians, district administrations, senior citizen groups, media, and the public on issues related to ageing, senior citizens’ rights, needs, challenges, and contributions.\nThe event brought together OPRN members and senior citizens to review and evaluate current policies and laws affecting older people in Pakistan, identify deficiencies in the current system, and formulate actionable recommendations for policy advocacy and future initiatives.\nThe event was chaired by Jehan Ara Moeen, a senior citizen, activist, and former PTV newscaster. In her opening remarks, Moeen stressed the importance of protecting the rights of older people, citing the lack of awareness, implementation of laws, and proper monitoring as significant issues contributing to the severe problems faced by senior citizens. She shared her observations on the dire conditions of women in shelter homes, where the absence of SOPs, monitoring and regulatory mechanisms exacerbates their plight. She welcomed the mandate and plans of OPRN to protect the rights of senior citizens in ICT.\nOPRN Coordinator and Senior Program Manager at LRF, Tahir Hasnain Shah presented the overall objective and agenda of the Event. Maryam Ihsan from the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) delivered a detailed presentation on current policies and laws related to older people in Pakistan.

Haroon Rasheed from REDO Foundation presented the services available for older people in Islamabad, which were found to be lacking or inadequate.\nThe final session, moderated by the OPRN Coordinator, focused on drafting policy recommendations for future advocacy and lobbying. The participants emphasized the need for the government to urgently finalize the ROBs of the ICT Senior Citizen Act, 2021, and allocate appropriate funds to ensure the law’s implementation.\nThe event concluded with a unanimous call for immediate government action to address these critical issues and improve the welfare of older people in Islamabad.\nThe Event was attended OPRN Members and Senior Citizens including by Dr. Sabiha Syed, Ex-officio, UNESCO; Ms. Khalida Zia, Safeguarding Specialist, VSO; Haroon Rasheed, REDO Foundation; Maqsooda Solangi, Aurat Foundation; Sidra Tehseen, Women Welfare Association; Hamid Khan, Help in Need; Raja Imran, SPRING Association; Tayyab Ali Awan Advocate; Dil Nasheen, PJN; colleagues from HelpAge International Syed Sajjad Hussain, Muhammad Bilal, Tanzila Sidique, and others.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
