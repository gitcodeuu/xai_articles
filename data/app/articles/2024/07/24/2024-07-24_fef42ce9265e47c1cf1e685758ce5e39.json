  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Governor Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Faisal Karim Kundi on Wednesday met with the Federal Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development, and the Federal Minister for Religious Affairs and Interfaith Harmony, Chaudhary Salik Hussain to discuss critical issues facing laborers and minorities in the region.\nDuring the meeting, Governor Faisal Kundi raised significant concerns about the challenges faced by laborers from Bannu, Lakki Marwat, Tank, DI Khan, South Waziristan, Mianwali, and Bhakkar. He highlighted the absence of a Protectorate of Emigrants office in the vicinity, which forces these laborers to undertake arduous journeys to obtain protected visas, as mandated by the Emigration Ordinance 1979.\nTo address this, Governor Kundi urged the establishment of a Protectorate of Emigrants office in Dera Ismail Khan, which would serve the aforementioned areas and significantly ease the process for the local labor force.\nAdditionally, the discussion extended to the potential development of a Labour Colony in Dera Ismail Khan.\nBoth officials considered the benefits of such a project, which would provide much-needed housing and facilities for laborers, thereby improving their living conditions and overall quality of life.\nGovernor Faisal Kundi also brought to attention the challenges faced by minorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\nHe requested the renovation and enhancement of Churches, Gurdwaras, and Shamshan Ghats across the province.\nEmphasizing the importance of modernizing these religious sites, he proposed the provision of solarization solutions to ensure a sustainable and uninterrupted energy supply.\nFederal Minister Chaudhary Salik Hussain expressed his support for these initiatives and assured that the concerns and proposals presented by Governor Kundi would be given due consideration. Both parties agreed on the need for collaborative efforts to improve the welfare of laborers and minorities, demonstrating a commitment to fostering inclusivity and development in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
