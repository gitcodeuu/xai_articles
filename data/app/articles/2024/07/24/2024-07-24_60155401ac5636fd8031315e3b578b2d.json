He underscored that the U.S.-Pakistan partnership goes beyond security and includes significant investments in health, trade, and development sectors.\nAmbassador Mariam Madiha Aftab, Additional Secretary (Americas), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that the U.S.-Pakistan relationship is dynamic and multifaceted, covering areas such as health, trade, defense, and energy security. She emphasized the importance of economic collaboration, security cooperation, educational exchanges, and climate change initiatives.\nMs. Aftab also addressed regional dynamics, stressing the need for the U.S. to play a crucial role in fostering peace and stability, and called for a peaceful resolution of the Jammu & Kashmir dispute in line with UN Security Council resolutions and will of the Kashmiri people.\nAmbassador Mansoor Khan, Director of the Beaconhouse Center for Policy Research (BCPR), emphasized the multifaceted nature of Pakistan-U.S. relations, highlighting political, security, defense cooperation, and economic ties. He announced the launch of a new undergraduate course on Pakistan-U.S. relations at BNU.\nDr. Neelum Nigar, Director of the Centre for Strategic Perspectives at ISSI, noted the significant contributions of the U.S. to Pakistan’s development in sectors like education, healthcare, and climate change. She stressed the need for mutual respect and cooperation to address contemporary challenges and opportunities.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood, Director General of ISSI, provided an extensive overview of the historical and current dynamics of Pakistan-U.S. relations. He acknowledged the evolving nature of the partnership, with a shift in focus from security to areas like trade, investment, energy, and people-to-people exchanges. He noted the cyclical pattern of bilateral relations, shaped by external factors, regional developments, and a narrower security-centric focus over the past many decades.\nStressing the importance of realistic expectations, he called for greater attention to Pakistan’s historical role and cumulative power potential in the emerging global order and the need for the U.S. to focus on Pakistan’s preoccupations and interests. Relating to regional concerns, particularly the impact of U.S.-India strategic partnership on Pakistan’s security especially within the ‘Indo-Pacific’ construct, he called for a responsive approach from Washington.\nHe also emphasized that Pakistan wished to nimbly navigate the complex dynamics of U.S.-China competition, and wished that cooperation rather than confrontation would be the key driver of their relationship. Highlighting mutual benefits from past cooperation, such as Sino-U.S. rapprochement and post-9/11 counter-terrorism efforts, Ambassador Sohail Mahmood stressed the alignment of new trade and investment emphases with Pakistan’s pivot to geo-economics.\nThe inaugural session concluded with Ambassador Khalid Mahmood, Chairman Board of Governors ISSI, presenting shields to the Chief Guest and Keynote speaker, followed by a group photograph.",
