  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Chairman of Khazana Enterprise Attiazaz Bob Din has said that Khazana is developing a cloud-based AI service in collaboration with Huawei, poised to revolutionize Pakistan’s cloud industry.\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of technology, cloud computing and artificial intelligence (AI) stand out as two of the most transformative forces shaping the future.\nLeading this transformation is Huawei Technologies, whose advanced innovations and strategic investments are driving significant advancements globally.\nHuawei, in collaboration with its local partners, is accelerating cloud adoption and helping organizations harness the power of its AI solutions by setting up local cloud nodes.\nAttiazaz Bob Din, Founder and Chairman of Khazana Enterprise, emphasized the transformative impact his company aims to have on the cloud space in Pakistan. “We are working towards revolutionizing cloud and AI adoption in Pakistan by setting up a state-of-the-art purpose-built facility for cloud and AI computing,” he said.\nCreating a collaborative and innovative team environment is key to Khazana’s success.\nHe highlighted the importance of fostering an open culture where team members feel valued and encouraged to share ideas. “I prioritize clear communication, regular brainstorming sessions, and cross-functional collaboration to leverage diverse perspectives. Recognizing and rewarding creativity, providing opportunities for professional development, and ensuring a supportive work atmosphere are key strategies,” he said.\nLooking to the future of cloud adoption, he envisions the integration of AI-driven applications and scalable cloud infrastructure transforming business operations and decision-making processes. He foresees AI becoming deeply embedded in all aspects of business, from automating routine tasks to providing predictive analytics that guide strategic decisions.\n“Cloud technology will continue to evolve, offering more robust and secure platforms for hosting AI applications, facilitating seamless scalability, and enabling real-time data processing and analysis,” he noted.\nThe convergence of AI and cloud, he believes, will drive significant advancements in personalized customer experiences, operational efficiencies, and innovative business models.\n“In Pakistan, there are many competitors in the cloud space, primarily telecommunications companies leveraging their data centers for co-location services,” he said.\nHowever, he pointed out that these companies primarily focus on co-location, while Khazana aims to provide a services-based cloud data center offering everything as a service.\nHe acknowledged the challenges in AI, such as the need for GPU processors and strong computing speed. Restrictions on public sales of chips like Nvidia in countries like Pakistan and China pose additional hurdles. However, with Huawei developing its large language models (LLM) and GPU cards, Khazana plans to leverage this relationship to offer AI solutions soon.\nDiscussing the future of AI in Pakistan, he said, “While cloud computing laid the groundwork, AI is poised to be the next frontier of technological advancement. Cloud provides the infrastructure and computational power necessary for AI to thrive. Without the cloud, the scale and speed at which AI can operate would be severely limited.”\nHe highlighted the potential for AI to transform various industries, from healthcare to agriculture, with endless possibilities just beginning to be explored.\nAddressing concerns about data privacy and security, Din emphasized that Khazana and Huawei have implemented multiple layers of security for their customers. “Trust is the cornerstone of any technological advancement. We must ensure that our systems are secure and that users have confidence in the technology,” he said, advocating for stringent regulations and robust security frameworks to protect sensitive information, ensuring Pakistani data remains within national borders.\nLooking ahead, he is optimistic about the future. He believes that continued innovation, coupled with strategic investments in education and infrastructure, can position Pakistan as a global leader in cloud and AI technologies. “The future is bright. With the right vision and commitment, we can achieve remarkable milestones,” he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
