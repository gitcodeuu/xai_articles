  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Jul 24 (APP):Senior leader of Pakistan Muslim League (N) Talal Chaudhry here on Wednesday said that PTI’s symbolic hunger strike was just a drama because a four-hour hunger strike is not a fast.\nIn his statement Talal said that PTI Parliamentarians hunger strike occurs after lunch and before evening tea, only for few hours which is a big drama with the followers of party and voters.\nHe lamented that leader of PTI  was enjoying delicious foods in the jail and here political workers are doing hunger strike for him. They are doing only for photo session and part time revolution nothing more just wasting the time of Parliament and nation.\nIt is the constitutional right of PTI to do hunger strike but only 4 hours hunger strike is a fun.\nThey should also go on a hunger strike against Imran Niazi’s duplicity and refusal to take the polygraph test after giving his confessional statement about the May 9 incident, Talal Chaudhry added.\nImran Niazi’s sisters and nephews were present outside the corps commander who kept on instructing people to reach the target.\nThey were sometimes plotting hunger strike and sometimes shutting down Pakistan, but they will not be succeeded in their aims.\nHe said that the PTI’s power show on Friday will have a flop show too.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
