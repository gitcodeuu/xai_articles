I had filed a petition in the Election Commission against this rigging, but Umar Ayub, who considers himself the champion of fair and transparent elections, started opposing him to dismiss his petition,” he said.\nBabar Nawaz Khan demanded that an impartial and transparent inquiry should be conducted into this whole matter.\n“My challenge is to Umar Ayub that instead of opposing my petition in the Election Commission, he should face it”, he said.\nHe has also condemned the desecration of the Pakistani flag in Frankfurt, Germany.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
