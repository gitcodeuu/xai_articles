Special wards have been set up in hospitals across the city, and the situation is being closely monitored.\nFurthermore, the Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC) East, Mehreen Baloch, visited several hospitals to check on the facilities provided for dengue patients, ensuring the availability of beds and other necessary services.\nThe district administration remains committed to tackling the dengue crisis and protecting citizens, with continuous efforts being made to manage both the prevention and treatment of the disease.",
