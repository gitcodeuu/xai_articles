He was of the view that consensus had been reached through dialogue in the Constitution (Twenty Sixth Amendment).\nHe explained that the objective of the Amendment was to strengthen the Constitution and the legal framework.\nIn response to a question, the JUI-F chief said “all judges are respectable to us, and we do not aim to make anyone controversial.”",
