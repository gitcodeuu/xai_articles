Only a retired Grade-22 officer or the top court’s serving or retired judges were eligible for the post, he added.\nThe chief justice asked the petitioner to satisfy the court as he had not attached any relevant material to prove his case.\nThe petitioner replied that he had taken information from the website of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP).\nThe ECP’s lawyer on the occasion presented the retirement notification of Sikandar Sultan Raja before his appointment as CEC.
