The top Palestinian leader was martyred in Iran.\nIsrael had no regard for human rights, rather it was violating them with impunity, he added.\nThe PPP chairman said that the war imposed by Israel in Palestine and Lebanon was inching towards Iran. “Israel is, in fact, on a drive to forcefully occupy the Palestinian lands for completing its agenda of a ‘greater Israel’.”\n“The PPP stands firm with the Muslims all over the world,” he added.\nThe JI delegation consisted of vice presidents Liaquat Baloch and Mian Aslam, Secretory General Ameer-ul-Azeem and Ameer JI Islamabad Chapter Engr Nasarullah Randhawa.\nPPP Vice President Senator Sherry Rehman, Secretory General Nayyer Hussain Bukhari, Naveed Qamar and PPP Chairman’s Spokesperson Murtaza Wahab were also present in the meeting.",
