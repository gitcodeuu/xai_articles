  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 07 (APP): Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has said that efficient and effective coordination, development of contingency plans and risk communication to farthest communities was critical for national resilience.\n‘National Resilience Day’ is a motivation for us to embrace the best practices and implement policies and strategies aimed at fortifying our nation’s resilience, the prime minister said in a message on the occasion of National Resilience Day.\nHe said the government’s policy initiatives should encompass various sectors, including safe development of infrastructure, improved disaster preparedness, poverty alleviation, safer spatial land use planning, adherence to building codes, efficient water resource management, sound agricultural practices, and increased afforestation nationwide, including coastal areas.\n“The 8th of October reminds us of the devastating earthquake of 2005 – a great tragedy that befell upon Pakistan and Azad Jammu & Kashmir. Our heartfelt prayers go to all those who endured loss of lives and properties,” he added.\nAfter the devastating 2005 earthquake, the floods of 2022 were a mega disaster surpassing all past records, he said adding that the people and institutions of Pakistan had always shown immense resolve and demonstrated ability to resurface amidst catastrophes and national crises, induced by climate change and environmental hazards.\nHe said Pakistan was facing an immense impact of climate change despite not being responsible for it. Frequent recurrence of unpredictable extreme events have given devastating blow to our struggling economy.\nHe commended the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) of Pakistan for its hard work to have evolved a tested mechanism as a national response towards such natural calamities.\nKey components of our national response include proactively working at reducing vulnerability to disasters and providing coping mechanisms and framework for effective disaster management.\nHe expressed his satisfaction that NDMA’s National Emergencies Operation Center (NEOC) had the best capacities in management of national disasters. “NEOC is founded on high-end technology inputs to create disasters’ early warnings much ahead of time – saving lives and infrastructure.”\nThe prime minister urged all stakeholders to seek synergy through greater and refined understanding of each other’s strengths and capacity limitations, achieving maximized interoperability amongst local, zonal, national, global, and public and private sectors through a ‘whole of society’ approach.\nOn this occasion, he also expressed the gratitude for the valuable help provided by the international community, civil society, and private philanthropy in bolstering the government’s national response efforts during the 2022 floods disaster.\nThe people of Pakistan have a history of philanthropy and generosity in times of crises and their response during the earthquake of 2005 and floods of 2022 is a vivid example of their benevolence.\nBy the grace of Allah, we have always, and continue to, fought through all such calamities with the help of our brave Pakistani brethren and sisters.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
