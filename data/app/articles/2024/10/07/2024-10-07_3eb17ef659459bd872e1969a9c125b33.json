Pakistan security and law enforcement agencies will spare no effort in apprehending the perpetrators and their facilitators. This act of terrorism is an attack not only on Pakistan but also on the enduring friendship between Pakistan and China. We will bring to justice those responsible for this cowardly attack, including the Majeed Brigade,” she reiterated.\nShe reaffirmed Pakistan’s unwavering commitment to the safety and security of Chinese nationals, projects, and institutions in Pakistan and continuously working hand in hand with China to defeat the forces of terror.\nComing to the situation in Kashmir, she expressed concerns as a tribunal handling under the Unlawful Activities Act, had upheld the Indian home ministry’s decision to extend the ban on the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front (JKLF) as an unlawful association for an additional five years.\nShe urged the Indian authorities to immediately release the incarcerated JKLF leader Yasin Malik and lift the ban on him and JKLF and other political parties, besides reiterating Pakistan’s continuous political, diplomatic, and moral support to the Kashmiri people.\nSpokesperson Baloch told the media that a high-level Saudi delegation, comprising representatives from a wide spectrum of government agencies and private sector entities, and led by Minister for Investment Engineer Khalid bin Abdulaziz Al-Falih would visit Pakistan from October 9-11, 2024, and meet with the president and the prime minister of Pakistan.\nShe said the visit aimed to lend positive impetus to enhance bilateral cooperation and mutually rewarding economic partnership.\nRegarding the recent visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, she mentioned his interactions with Prime Minister Shehbaz, President Asif Ali Zardari and participation in the Malaysia-Pakistan High-Level Business Dialogue.

Secondly, there are no cases against him in Pakistan so he is free to visit Pakistan.”\nTo another query, she said Pakistan was ready to host the SCO Heads of Government meeting. “We are ready to welcome all our distinguished guests and to make their visit and stay in Pakistan as comfortable as possible.”\nWith regards to the security around the conference, she said it was a top priority of the Government of Pakistan and measures were being taken to ensure the safety and security of all guests who visit Pakistan for the SCO heads of government meeting.\nShe strongly condemned the provocative and sacrilegious remarks regarding the Holy Prophet (PBUH), made by a Hindu priest, Yati Narsinghanand. “The remarks have gravely hurt the feelings of the people of Pakistan and Muslims around the world. We urge the Indian authorities to hold the priest in question to account and take immediate action to curb the growing tide of religious intolerance and hate speech targeting Muslims in India.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
