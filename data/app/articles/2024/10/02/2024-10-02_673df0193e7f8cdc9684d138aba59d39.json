All the assistant commissioners have conducted raids across the city, targeting construction sites, educational institutions, and warehouses where dengue larvae were found.\nIn the Pothohar area, the Assistant Commissioner (AC) arrested six people in Sector I-11 for failing to comply with anti-dengue regulations. Meanwhile, AC Nillore apprehended four individuals, while five more were arrested from the Industrial Area I-9. Another arrest was made in Sector G-8 for similar violations.\nThe Deputy Commissioner (DC) of Islamabad, Irfan Nawaz Memon instructed all assistant commissioners to intensify operations in their respective areas. He warned that any further breaches of anti-dengue SOPs will lead to immediate and severe consequences.\nThe district administration is also focusing on known dengue hotspots across Islamabad. A team recently inspected a Mini Golf Club in a private housing society, where dengue larvae were found in worn-out tires on a racing track and in air coolers.\nOn the occasion, the DC ordered a thorough inspection of all such hotspots in the city and instructed authorities to take strict action against anyone found responsible for allowing dengue larvae to breed.\nFurthermore, the district administration has urged businesses and residents to cooperate fully in implementing the anti-dengue measures. By addressing potential breeding grounds and following the SOPs, the administration hopes to prevent the spread of dengue in the city.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
