The committee called for improved coordination with provinces to ensure effective climate action, especially in areas such as waste management and environmental protection.\nThe discussion extended to other significant national projects, including the “Living Indus” initiative and glacier monitoring efforts. The committee inquired about the Ministry’s coordination with provincial authorities to ensure comprehensive execution of these plans. The Ministry reassured the committee that the ministry and Pakistan’s Climate Change Authority (recently formed) is actively working with provinces to streamline efforts, and plans are underway to strengthen this collaboration further.\nPakistan’s increasing mangrove cover and progress on the Green Pakistan Program, with 2.2 billion trees planted, were praised.
