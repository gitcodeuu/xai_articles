He said the vehicular traffic during the routine and peak hours was increasing in the federal capital with no decline in number and also the emissions that are equally rising as the sky remains murky from morning till evening.\nA senior pulmonologist at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Doctor Zia ul Haq said respiratory diseases during winters surge due to dry and cold air.\nHe added that the dry and cold air also damages the respiratory tract, causing infection and damaging the breathing organs.\nPulmonologists usually advise the elderly above 50 or patients with chronic heart, kidney, and lung diseases to get the flu vaccine during the extreme winter season to avoid respiratory diseases.\nPulmonologists advised avoiding unnecessary outdoor visits during the evening and morning timings of cold weather. In case of an emergency outdoor visit, people should properly cover their faces and eyes by wearing face masks and coverings.
