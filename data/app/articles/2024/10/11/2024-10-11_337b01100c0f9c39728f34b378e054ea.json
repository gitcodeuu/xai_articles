However, if consensus cannot be reached, how long will the government wait?” He reiterated that only the PPP’s full draft has been released, and the JUI’s draft is still pending.\nHe shared that a detailed meeting of the Parliamentary Committee took place on Friday, where all parties presented their views. The PPP presented its original draft proposals, which focused on issues related to the Constitutional Court.\nBilawal also mentioned that the Law Minister conducted thorough consultations with lawyers, whose suggestions were considered during the meeting. Opposition parties also shared their feedback on the proposals.\nHe said that Maulana Fazlur Rahman reaffirmed his position of wanting to develop a consensus-based draft with the PPP. “We also reiterated that any constitutional amendment should be carried out through consensus among political parties. Our efforts are focused on producing a consensus draft, and we are not opposing suggestions without reason,” he said.\nBilawal further highlighted that the federal government is confident in its majority. “The Law Minister indicated they have a two-thirds majority, but they are still willing to engage all political parties to build consensus on this issue,” he said.\n“I appreciate their approach, but since last month, we’ve been working towards a consensus. The question now is, how long will the government provide us with space and time to reach one?” he added.\nBilawal said, “I am doing my best to foster a consensus. If this process takes longer than expected, the government may choose to exercise its constitutional right and proceed with the amendments.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
