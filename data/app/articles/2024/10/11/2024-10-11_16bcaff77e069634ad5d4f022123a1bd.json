  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 11 (APP):The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) conducted an independent Quality of Service (QoS) survey in 23 cities across Sindh, Punjab, Balochistan, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to evaluate the performance of Cellular Mobile Operators (CMOs).\nAccording to news release of the PTA, survey routes covered main and service roads, and sectors, colonies, with around 4,000 km traveled per CMO over 83 days.\nDuring the survey, 0.38 million mobile broadband tests and 57,500 voice call and SMS tests were conducted using automated QoS monitoring tools.\nBased on compliance with KPIs from NGMS licenses and QoS Regulations 2021, CMOs were ranked for mobile network coverage, voice services, and broadband speed.\nSurvey results showed compliance in upload/download speeds and improvements in network latency and webpage loading times.\nSome voice KPIs, however, fell below the licensed threshold in certain areas.\nOperators using advanced technologies like LTE Carrier Aggregation and Voice over LTE provided better services.\nPTA has instructed operators to improve service quality. The survey aims to enhance mobile service quality and foster healthy competition among operators.\nThe detailed survey results are available on the PTA’s website and can be accessed at the following link (https://pta.gov.pk/en/consumer-support/qos-survey/qos-survey).\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
