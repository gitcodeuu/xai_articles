He encouraged policymakers to learn from neighbouring countries such as China and Uzbekistan, where strategic planning and collaboration with global businesses have led to rapid economic development.\nHe also emphasised the importance of imbibing from the Saudi experience and working closely with Saudi authorities to significantly expand the Kingdom’s investment profile in Pakistan.\nISSI Director General Sohail Mahmood, in his remarks, outlined Pakistan’s unique advantages, emphasising the its strategic geographical location at the crossroads of key regions such as the Middle East, Central Asia, and South Asia.\nHe pointed out that Pakistan’s youthful population provided an unmatched demographic advantage, while its vast natural resources make it an attractive destination for investors.\nSohail Mahmood also acknowledged the challenges preventing Pakistan from fully realising its investment potential. He noted that while Pakistan had made progress in improving its ease of doing business ranking, significant hurdles remained including regulatory complexities and concerns about policy continuity. “These factors, along with lingering perceptions of security issues, contribute to investor hesitation.”\nHe, however, expressed his optimism that despite the challenges, sectors such as IT, agriculture, and textiles were ripe for enhanced investment. He underscored the importance of fostering trust and stability to attract long-term investments and called for collaboration among all stakeholders – including government institutions, private sector, business leaders, and the media and civil society – to create an environment conducive to sustainable growth and turn Pakistan into a truly attractive investment destination.\nEarlier, Director of the China Pakistan Study Centre Dr Talat Shabbir, in his introductory remarks, highlighted Pakistan’s immense potential despite current economic challenges. He emphasized the role of Special Economic Zones (SEZs) established under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in attracting foreign investment by offering tax incentives and improved infrastructure.\nFormer Air Chief Marshal Sohail Aman, in his concluding remarks, stressed the integral connection between security, stability, and economic prosperity, noting that Pakistan’s progress depends on creating an environment conducive to foreign investment. He emphasized the importance of a united approach, with leadership playing a pivotal role in fostering long-term economic stability.\nThe talk was attended by corporate leaders, senior civil servants, academics, practitioners, think tank experts, media personnel, and members of civil society.",
