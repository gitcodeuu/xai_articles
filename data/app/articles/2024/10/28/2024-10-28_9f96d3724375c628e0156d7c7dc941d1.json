Therefore, the country’s delegation at the COP29, however, would also call for the fulfillment of prior commitments to ensure vulnerable nations can effectively address climate.\n“I must highlight here that Pakistan always advocates for a clear and actionable framework from the rich countries, responsible for global warming, to address loss and damage resulting from unfolding climate crisis in the resource-poor countries like ours that have disproportionately borne the brunt of climate impacts despite minuscule share in overall global carbon emissions,” Romina Khurshid Alam said.\nShe also emphasized that being a responsible country, Pakistan also stands ready to collaborate with global partners to forge actionable solutions that address the climate crisis facing the global community, public infrastructure and economies.\n“We must realize that ‘only together’ we can build a sustainable and resilient future for all through joint enhanced climate action,” Alam stressed.\nThe PM’s climate aide said that climate action at any level should align with sustainable development and low-carbon goals and achieving this role of the rich countries with finances, technology and technical know-how is of unprecedented importance.\nAddressing the event, Secretary climate change & environmental coordination ministry Aisha Humera Moriani said the country, like several other vulnerable nations, is bearing the brunt of the unfolding catastrophe. In 2022, Pakistan was hit by a super flood which affected 33 million people, she recalled.\n“As Pakistan navigates the complexities of climate finance change, carbon markets and resilience building as a part of efforts to tackle adverse impacts of climate, it is clear that no meaningful progress can be made without strong collaboration with civil society,” the federal secretary Ms Moriani told the participants.\nShe said that the climate change and environmental coordination ministry secretary said that as a highly climate vulnerable country that needs around US$ 350 billion till 2030 for a comprehensive response to the climate crisis, Pakistan wants to see a New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance agreed at upcoming COP29 global climate talks.\nEarlier in her welcome, remarks, Ayesha Khan, chief executive of the Civil Society Coalition for Climate Change (CSCCC), said that it is matter of a serious concern that rich nations have failed to meet their climate finance pledges for the climate vulnerable countries. This has only exacerbated the vulnerability of the poor countries, most of them in Asian countries, to the adverse impacts of climate change.\n“The cost of inaction is getting higher with every fraction of increase in the temperature and with every day of delay in realizing our policy objectives,” she remarked.",
