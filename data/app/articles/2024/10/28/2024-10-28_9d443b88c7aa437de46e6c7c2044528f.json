  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 28 (APP): Federal Minister for Communications, Board of Investment and Privatization Abdul Aleem Khan on Monday visited the National Highway Authority (NHA) headquarters, inspected the National Traffic Operation Center and commended Pakistan’s motorway and GT road notable revenue growth and technological upgrades.\nAleem Khan expressed satisfaction over the transition of 99 percent of vehicles on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway to the M-Tag system, which has greatly reduced traffic congestion and streamlined toll operations. “The shift to M-Tag has improved traffic flow significantly and I am pleased with NHA’s efforts to modernize the toll collection process,” Aleem Khan stated.\nAleem Khan further highlighted the record-breaking financial achievements of the NHA, reporting a 100 percent increase in revenue, with the projected target rising to Rs 110 billion from last year’s Rs 64 billion.\n“This is an unprecedented milestone, marking the first time a public institution will generate an additional Rs 50 billion in revenue,” the minister said.\nThe federal minister directed the NHA to reduce cash lanes across all motorways and increase the number of M-Tag booths. He also instructed that all toll plazas be equipped with camera systems to monitor vehicles and capture license plate information, emphasizing that these updates should be available to the Secretary of Communications and the NHA Chairman. “Daily revenue reports should be prepared to maintain accountability and progress,” Aleem Khan added.\nFor the next phase of the M-Tag initiative, he proposed implementing a double toll fee for vehicles without M-Tags, following a two-week public awareness campaign.\nAleem Khan highlighted the importance of transitioning all motorways to M-Tag for improved safety and smoother traffic flow.\nFederal minister praised NHA officials for achieving a 99 percent M-Tag adoption rate on the Lahore-Sialkot Motorway and called for similar progress on other routes, with a focus on reducing cash lanes and alleviating traffic congestion.\nIn recognition of NHA’s efforts and revenue growth, the minister announced bonuses and incentives for employees who contributed to the institution’s success.
