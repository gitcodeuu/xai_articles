We see a great potential in an enhanced cooperation in the formats of parliamentary friendship groups as well as through specialized committees of the upper houses of our parliaments.”\n“We much count on the joint active work of the two parliaments in improving the legal framework for cooperation”.\nShe urged for more progressive development of trade and economic ties based on solid and time tested foundation.

It grew by another 13 percent in January-August this year, she added.\nShe said that there were many promising areas for the development of economic cooperation including energy and agro-industrial complex.\nLast year, the first shipment of Russian crude oil arrived at the port of Karachi, and by the end of the year its share in Russian exports to Pakistan exceeded 20 percent, she said.\nThe Speaker said that Russia was continuously contributing to Pakistan’s food security and increased grain supplies to the Pakistani market.\nShe noted that despite unfavourable weather conditions, Russian farmers have harvested over 132 million tons of grain this year guarantees Russia’s reliability as one of the world’s key agricultural exporters.\n“Developing international transport corridors, primarily the North South International Transport Corridor, is relevant for our countries.

In her autobiography “Daughter of the East” which has been translated into Russian she wrote that politics was a difficult area of effort for a woman in any society; they still had to go the extra mile to prove that they are equal to men, they had to work harder and longer hours and make more sacrifices. I believe it to be true for women in any country. But we can see how (he situation is changing for the better”.\nDear colleagues, “We have a lot in common, Russia and Pakistan are federal States. Parliaments in both Russia and Pakistan are bicameral. The Senate, is also called the Federation Chamber, the federal structure of State. Similarly, the Federation Council of Russia is also called the Chamber of Regions and paid much attention to the development of cooperation between constituent entities of the federation and their foreign partners.\nShe said that expanding and developing cooperation with Pakistan was growing in the regions as well “We believe that closer interregional ties are very promising, an agreement in place on establishing direct ties between St. Petersburg and the province of Sindh signed in 2017.\nShe confident that the avenue of cooperation requires parliamentary support and needs to be upscaled to include other regions.\n“We share similar goals, joint tasks and plans; this means that joint action is soon to follow and continues work to develop cooperation between Russia and Pakistan for the benefit of both countries and peoples,” she said.\nAt the end, she uttered Pakistan-Roosi dosti zindabad!",
