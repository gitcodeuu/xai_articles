From her early years in Soviet youth leadership to becoming one of Russia’s most influential figures, her journey is a testament to hard work, perseverance, and visionary leadership.\nHe said that “A pivotal moment was her tenure as Governor of Saint Petersburg, where she revitalized the city, focusing on economic growth, cultural preservation, and global engagement, turning it into a hub for diplomacy and investment. Her diplomatic expertise extends well beyond Russian Federation”.\nAs Ambassador to Malta and Permanent Representative to the UN, Ms. Matvienko significantly advanced Russia’s interests on the global stage, earning respect for her ability to navigate complex diplomatic landscapes and foster cooperation, he added.\nGilani went on saying that her current role as Speaker of the Federation Council marks a pinnacle of achievement, making her one of the most influential women in Russian politics. Under her leadership, the Federation Council has been instrumental in advancing Russia’s legislative agenda and deepening international cooperation.\n“Your contributions to the empowerment of women, your advocacy for social development, and your commitment to multilateralism resonate deeply with Pakistan’s values”, he remarked.\nThe Chairman Senate observed that her leadership continues to inspire women around the world to pursue leadership roles and contribute to societal progress. We are particularly proud to stand beside a leader who shares Pakistan’s vision of inclusive and sustainable development. A rarity, the address to the Senate of Pakistan today by her will mark a new chapter in the history of not only the Senate but also Russia-Pakistan ties, he added.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
