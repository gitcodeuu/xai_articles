He credited the charter with stabilizing democracy, allowing Parliament to complete its term, and uniting political parties against non-democratic forces that promoted sit-ins and unrest.\nMuhammad Nawaz Sharif emphasised the need for a justice system where institutions and public opinion hold more weight than individual influence.\nNawaz stressed the importance of preventing any single individual from dominating and potentially destabilizing Pakistan’s democratic system. He advocates for a system where no one person has the authority to undermine the democratic process at will, ensuring the country and its people are protected from being led into darkness by individual ambitions.\nToday’s economic success relies heavily on political unity and agreement, said Nawaz adding in fact, the Charter of Democracy emphasizes the importance of all forces working together to achieve economic and political stability in Pakistan, ultimately leading to a prosperous nation.\nNawaz Sharif stated that PPP and PML-N are united in promoting political tolerance, morality, constitution, law and parliamentary supremacy.\nHe praised the 18th Amendment for strengthening institutions and democracy, and commended Bilawal Bhutto’s political efforts, emphasizing collective progress over individual interests.\nBilawal Bhutto Zardari praised the historic contributions of Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif in advancing Pakistan’s democracy, emphasizing the need to continue this journey.
