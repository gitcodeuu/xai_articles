While the previous model involved only two banks, the new model has expanded to six banks.\nThe step was taken to streamline cash disbursements and ensure transparency.\nHe further shared that the new payment model will save BISP Rs. 02 billion annually. To ensure transparency, payments are disbursed through designated campsites under the supervision of BISP staff in coordination with local administration.\nThe Secretary also emphasized the reliability of the NSER database, which is widely utilized by both public and private organizations for various social safety projects. International Development Partners of BISP also recognize the database’s authenticity.\nThe visit concluded with an interactive Question and Answers session, where the participants expressed their gratitude for the detailed briefing and praised BISP’s efforts in supporting marginalized communities.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
