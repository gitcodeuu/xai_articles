Farooqi former Chairman of NEPRA said the only criterion in selecting which electron is the most suitable should be the one which is affordable, reliable and sustainable and nuclear fulfils all these characteristics. He added that expertise gained by PAEC in operating and maintaining (O&M) nuclear power plants in Pakistan should be exploited and utilized in providing O&M services to countries which are boarding civilian nuclear power now and in future.\nHe stressed that after COP29, the commitment to triple the carbon-free energy all over the world, the importance of nuclear power has further enhanced being emission-free and sustainable source.\nThe seminar was addressed online by Dr. Henri Paillere, Head of Planning & Financing Studies at IAEA who assessed the pros and cons of nuclear power and stressed that nuclear was a long-term solution which is sustainable and its advantages outweighed the disadvantages of high capital cost.\nHe also quoted the International Energy Agency (IEA) that “Without nuclear, it is very hard to reach our target of emission and carbon-free energy”.\nDr. Afia Malik of PIDE also addressed the seminar and said that after the decision of the govt to discontinue the supply of gas to captive power plants, nuclear presents a viable option.\nIrfan Tariq, former DG Ministry of Climate Change, highlighted the climate change issues and the role of nuclear power in its mitigation.\nSyed Muhammad Ali, a prominent analyst, spoke about the role of nuclear power in energy security.\nAmbassador Aizaz Chaudhary, former Foreign Secretary and Syed Akhtar Ali former member Planning Commission chaired the sessions.\nEminent politician and Senator Mushahid Hussain Syed addressing the seminar paid rich tribute to scientists associated with the nuclear program of the country and stressed that it is important for Pakistan to shift from fossil fuel to clean options including nuclear power.\nHe acknowledged that nuclear power is clean, and green and would work as a stimulus for socio-economic growth.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
