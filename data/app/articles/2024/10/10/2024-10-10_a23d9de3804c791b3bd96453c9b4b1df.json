  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 10 (APP):Chairman of the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR), Rashid Mahmood Langrial, said on Thursday that the FBR was gearing up for a large-scale crackdown on non-filers starting next month.\nTalking to a private news channel, he said that the FBR now has comprehensive data on individuals who have failed to file their tax returns.\nHe said that there was a clear directive from the Prime Minister to adopt a strict stance on tax evasion, leaving no room for leniency.\nChairman also mentioned that measures were being considered to ban non-filers from international travel in coming months.\nHe further said that providing incorrect sales tax data was a crime and under-filing of income tax returns remains a significant issue.\nThe final deadline for filing income tax returns is set for October 14, which will not be extended, he said.\nTo enhance the performance of FBR, Chairman said a plan has been devised to improve fieldwork capabilities of FBR officers.\nHe further underscored that expanding the tax net remains a top priority for the FBR.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
