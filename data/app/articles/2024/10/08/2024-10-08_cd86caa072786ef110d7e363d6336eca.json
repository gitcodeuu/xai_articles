We will not tolerate it at any rate, at any cost. This is my promise. I will not let it happen,” the prime minister in his opening remarks at the meeting of the federal cabinet chaired by him.\nThe prime minister drew cabinet members’ attention to an attack that took place near Karachi airport killing two Chinese engineers and injuring another, despite the government’s all-out efforts to ensure their security.\nHe apprised the meeting of his telephonic conversation with the Chinese ambassador in Islamabad and also a condolatory visit to the Chinese embassy where he reiterated his government’s assurance to leave no stone unturned to make the security of Chinese national “unreachable.”\nReferring to the PTI protest, the prime minister said that the allegations were hurled against the government and attempts were made to create chaos at a time when the Chinese Premier was about to pay a bilateral visit and a Saudi delegation was also scheduled to visit Pakistan and MoUs and agreements worth $2 billion are expected to be signed.\nThe cabinet meeting offered Fateha for the security personnel martyred in different terrorist incidents.\nThe prime minister thanked China, Saudi Arabia and the UAE for their support in obtaining the IMF loan facility and also mentioned last week’s “successful” visit of Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim when two sides agreed that Pakistan would export Halal meat and rice to Malaysia.\nHe said consequent to the “finest level” of teamwork, the IMF program had been approved, inflation was reduced from 32% to 6.9%, exports, remittances and IT exports were on surge and the stock exchange was skyrocketing. He said sabotaging all these efforts for the sake of their politics would be the biggest conspiracy to the country, he remarked.\nHighlighting his government’s reform agenda, he mentioned the doubled number of tax return filers, broadening tax base and the digitisation of FBR.\nHe said oil prices had been reduced for the fifth time, and a Rs50 billion relief package was announced for the power consumers of the protected category, apart from the Punjab government’s Rs55 billion package on top of that.\nHe said on one side, the government was making efforts to stabilize the economy and kick-start its home-grown economic program, while on the other, KP chief minister was leading the saboteur gathering consisting of Afghan nationals and also using government officials. The protestors also carried out aerial firing and an official of Islamabad Police was martyred during the protest, he added.\nPrime Minister Shehbaz said that the peaceful and secure atmosphere was inevitable to attract investment.\nThanking the IMF chief for her support in approving the IMF facility for Pakistan, the prime minister said that she was also appreciative of the reforms introduced by the incumbent and the caretaker governments.\nHe mentioned the martyrdom of a lieutenant colonel and other security personnel, and said the government knew where the terrorists were being funded from.",
