  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 23 (APP):The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Wednesday sought a response from Member of National Assembly from NA 262, Quetta, Adil Bazai, concerning a disqualification petition lodged against him for not voting in favour of budget and the 26th constitutional amendment.\nA three-member bench of the Election Commission, chaired by the Chief Election Commissioner, heard a reference filed by PML-N President Nawaz Sharif seeking the disqualification of Adil Bazai.\nNotably, the National Assembly Speaker forwarded the disqualification reference to the Election Commission at the request of PML-N President Nawaz Sharif. The reference claims that Adil Bazai, who was elected independently and later joined PML-N, did not vote in favor of the finance bill despite directives from the parliamentary party.\nAdil Bazai and PML-N lawyers appeared before the Election Commission, where the Chief Election Commissioner asked about Bazai’s whereabouts. His brother responded that they currently have no information on his location.\nThe Election Commission instructed the concerned party to provide a copy of the reference to Adil Bazai’s lawyer and directed Bazai to submit his response by November 5.\nMeanwhile, in another case, the lawyer for Sohail Sultan, a National Assembly member from NA-4 Swat and a member of the Sunni Ittehad Council, stated that the high court has issued a stay order until November 7. Now their case will be referred to the constitutional bench.\nHowever, the commission emphasized that it operates as a constitutional body and it has  no concerns with constitutional bench.The Chief Election Commissioner contended that proceedings will continue if the stay is vacated. The next hearing of the case will be on November 11.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
