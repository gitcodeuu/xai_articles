The inflation is the biggest tax for the common man that reduces its purchasing power capacity. The power sector prices are causing negative impacts on common masses,” he said.\nThe Minister underlined that the PM taskforce was actively taking up this issue and efforts were underway, however the Power Minister should be asked for a detailed workplan to reduce power prices by the Assembly.\nEarlier, Parliamentary Secretary for Commerce, Zulfiqar Ali Bhatti said under the National Tarriff Policy 2019, the government have rationalized 6,500 tariff lines out of the total 7,580 and reduced 2,198 tariff lines to zero.\nHe added that a Rs 22 billion relief was given to the industry and traders and the government was organizing trade expos to improve exports of the country.",
