The strong position of textiles and leather manufacturing in Pakistan has historically been driven by availability of skilled workforce and local supply of major input materials which underpin the sector’s comparative advantage, he said.\nHe said that the sector has had a unique distinction of consistently building intensive backward and forward linkages which translate into a vertically integrated industrial value chain.\nHe said that Pakistan has made significant strides in diversifying its product base.

Over the past decade, there has been a consistent increase in exports of apparel and home textiles from Pakistan, he said.\nHe said that we now offer a vast array of products, including high-quality apparel, technical textiles, home textiles, and specialized fabrics, which are contributing substantially to our exports. However, there is more room for further enhancement and expansion.\nHe said that Pakistan’s strength is not limited to value-added goods produced from cotton fiber alone. With advancements in technology and infrastructure, Pakistan domestically produces a wide range of synthetic, blended and functional raw materials, intermediates, and finished products in manmade fiber segment, he said.\nJam Kamal Khan said that Pakistan foresees much expansion in this segment supported by strength of international demand.\nHe said that Pakistan’s exporters have, in the recent years, demonstrated a strong and significant commitment to Environment, Social and Governance practices.\nThe sector is undergoing a profound transformation and is positioning itself for robust export growth, he said.\nHe said that individual companies are adopting traceability technologies to consciously champion supply chain transparency in alignment with global requirements.

The global economic uncertainty, shifting consumer demands, rising costs of raw materials, and fluctuating energy prices have created headwinds for our industry. However, technological advancements and evolving standards in sustainability and compliance have raised the bar for global competitiveness, he said.\nHe said that iIn 2022, climate change-induced floods devastated vast cotton-growing areas and disrupted supply of local inputs in Pakistan. The textiles and leather sector today are on a robust path to recovery and regaining their lost ground in the aftermath of strong external and internal shocks, he said.\nHe said that the current IMF financial agreement, improvement in international rating, inflation and interest rates going down and stock exchange are reaching new heights.\nHe expressed gratitude to all the foreign delegates who have traveled from around the world to join the Texpo-2024 and said their presence is a powerful symbol of our shared commitment to the future of these industries.\nHe also appreciated all the exhibitors, organizers, and committees who have worked tirelessly to make TEXPO 2024 a success.\nEarlier, the Chairman TDAP Zubair Motiwala in his address, welcomed the foreign delegates in the event.\nHe said that we are supplier to all the brands in the world and we produce quality goods.\nHe said that the delegates who are participating in the event are now like of ambassadors of Pakistan and called upon them to share their experiences in the Pakistan globally.\nThe CM Sindh Syed Murad Ali Shah said the Texpo provides opportunities to our craftsman to show their talents to the world.\nHe said that the main destinations of the leader and textile products are Euorpe and United States and both are friendly with Pakistan.\nGovernor Khyber-Pakhtunkhaw, Faisal Kareem Kundi in his address expressed confidence that the delegates participating in the event will also promote the soft image of Pakistan to the world.\nOn the occasion, Chairman TDAP Zubair Motiwala presented souvenirs to the Federal Commerce Minister, Jam Kamal Khan and Sindh CM Syed Murad Ali Shah.\nLater, Federal Commerce Minister,  Jam Kamal Khan and Sindh CM Syed Murad Ali Shah and others visited the stalls set up in various halls at Karachi Expo Center.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
