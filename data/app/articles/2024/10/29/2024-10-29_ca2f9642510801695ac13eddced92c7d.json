We invite you to invest, to bring your expertise and creativity to Pakistan, as we build a future rooted in resilience and shared prosperity,” the prime minister said during his address at the plenary session of the 8th edition of two-day Future Investment Initiative (FII) held here.\nhttps://x.com/cmshehbaz/status/1851277536443187460?s=46&t=SApcAZAv0zK56lMSgiF_fg\nThe prime minister said that he was elated to share that Pakistan, too, was on a transformative journey; a journey of resilience, sacrifice, and a relentless pursuit of stability and growth.\nAttended by global leaders, this year’s FII is themed “Infinite Horizons: Investing Today, Shaping Tomorrow” and focuses on global investments aimed at addressing major issues such as artificial intelligence, robotics, education, energy, space, finance, healthcare, and sustainability.\nThe participating countries engage in the dialogue for the promotion of investment and a sustainable future while highlighting the strength of their respective economies.\nThe FII conference featured discussions on artificial intelligence, robotics, education, energy, space, public health, and challenges confronting sustainable development.\nThe prime minister, citing future course, said Pakistan was laying the foundation for a knowledge-based economy driven by innovation in three pivotal domains, artificial intelligence, education, and health in which they looked forward to forging useful partnerships.\n“AI is more than a trend; it’s a force revolutionizing economies, societies, and industries. At this critical juncture, Pakistan is not just embracing AI, we are committed to excelling in it,” he said, adding their mission was clear and it was to; encourage young minds to redefine the boundaries of AI; training skilled engineers and data scientists as the backbone of Pakistan’s AI growth; and equipping their workforce to harness the power of AI across industries.\nAlong with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and like-minded global partners, the prime minister said Pakistan envisioned AI as a force for good, free from biases.\nSince assuming office in March this year, he said, the progress and prosperity of people had been his government’s laser focus.\nThrough the commitment of their people and the support of their partners, like the brotherly country Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, they had restored macroeconomic stability and were now ready to enter a period of sustained growth and progress, he added.\nPrime Minister Sharif said “This journey is not just ours, it’s a call to our friends across the world, because together, we are stronger. Together, we can shape a future defined by innovation, prosperity, and success.”\nHe further elaborated that Pakistan was blessed with something truly precious, the youth who was their promise to tomorrow.\n“Talented, resilient, and armed with an untiring spirit, they are now ready to take on the emerging challenges,” he added.\nInspired by Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, championed by Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, the prime minister said Pakistan shared a common mission and invest in their youth to shape the future.\n“In this pursuit, it is not just a responsibility; it is our persistent endeavour to empower our youth with quality education, digital inclusivity, and the cross-cutting tools they need to thrive in a rapidly evolving world,” he opined.\nThe prime minister further said that in agriculture, climate resilience, and the fight against misinformation, they could unleash AI’s potential not merely to compete, but to uplift and empower.\n“Our aspirations in AI and beyond are deeply rooted in a solid educational foundation. Through educational reforms, vocational trainings, and digital literacy, we aim to build a skilled, tech-savvy generation,” he added.\nThe prime minister said projects like Daanish Schools and the Education Endowment Fund in Pakistan that his government steered, made quality education accessible to those who once saw it as an unattainable dream.\n“Today, he said these graduates aren’t just students; they are builders of tomorrow as doctors, engineers, and innovators. They are pioneers, driving progress and uplifting their communities, a testament to the transformative power of accessible education. Their success stories reinforce my belief that education is a true equalizer and a game-changer for individuals and nations alike,” he observed.\nThe prime minister further said that health was the cornerstone of human advancement and Pakistan’s healthcare sector was home to over 275,000 registered doctors with their youth pioneering new health-tech solutions.\nWith advancements in healthcare standards, they envisioned a future where their doctors and scientists collaborated across borders for a healthier tomorrow, he added.\n“Imagine the impact, pooling resources in areas like genome sequencing and personalized medicine. With such collaborations, we can redefine the whole healthcare system,” he further emphasized.\nThe prime minister enumerated that their institutions like King Edward Medical College, NUST and Aga Khan University held immense potential for breakthroughs in diagnostics, treatment and disease prevention.\nAt Pakistan Kidney and Liver Institute & Research Centre (PKLI), a centre of excellence in specialized care and research, they were unrelenting in the commitment to providing ‘state of the art’ medical services to the people which contributed to building a healthier, more resilient society.\n“As we look toward these infinite horizons and unpack our potential, one truth becomes clear: the future of human advancement doesn’t lie in isolation, it lies in collaboration in working together for win-win outcomes,” he stressed.\nThe prime minister expressed the hope that as Pakistan and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia moved towards new realms of possibility, from their shared heritage to the frontiers of innovation, this partnership might shine as a beacon for all.\n“Let this be our legacy: a commitment to a vision that transcends borders, embraces boundless potential, and inspires generations to come,” he added.\nHe also stressed that global human advancement and transformation could not take place unless peace was restored in Gaza and bloodshed stopped.\nThe prime minister also expressed his deepest gratitude to Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Mohammed bin Salman, Crown Prince and Prime Minister of Saudi Arabia, for their remarkable vision and foresight in convening the important gathering of world leaders, experts and civil society to address issues shaping our future.\nHe further said as he stood in Riyadh, a city that had evolved from a desert oasis into a global metropolis, he was inspired by a vision that resonated beyond borders, a vision of limitless possibilities, where the choices they made today set the course for a future they dreamt of.",
