He said that the number of FBR filers had doubled, adding that this would definitely yield positive results for the country.\nAttaullah Tarar said that economic vision of the Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif was being implemented and now the world was terming Pakistan’s economy as emerging economy. He said that credit goes to PML-N that it saved the country from default. He said that World Bank President Ajay Banga was also terming Pakistan’s economy policy as good policy. The minister said that subsidy had been provided on electricity while prices of essential items were reducing. Price of petrol had been reduced for five times, he said and added with the grace of Allah Almighty Pakiatan would become prosperous. He said that Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf was again using tactics of holding public meetings and marches because they couldn’t digest country’s progress and stability.\nHe said that PTI should focus on bringing change in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa instead of creating unrest and chaos.\nHe said that KP Chief Minister should focus on providing health, education and other facilities to people of KP but unfortunately he was using all his energies to keep his leader happy. He said that credit goes to the PML-N for constructing motorways, China Pakistan Economic Corridor project, energy projects, growth of industry and many other big initiatives.\nHe said that purpose of holding protest in red zone was just to halt the country’s system.
