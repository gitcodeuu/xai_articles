Zainab Naeem, Associate Research Fellow, Head of Circularity, noted the mission’s focus on assessing Pakistan’s textile value chain to enhance sustainable trade practices.\nBeatriz Fernandez of UNEP’s Environment and Trade Team emphasized textiles’ economic importance, especially for women, who comprise 45% of the sector’s workforce. However, she highlighted the need to address environmental concerns such as microplastic pollution, which the textile industry contributes to at a rate of 9%.\nThe workshop provided a platform for experts, industry representatives, and government officials to share insights and foster collaborations. Presentations outlined the current scale of secondhand clothing imports in Pakistan, which saw a 17% increase in 2023-24, totaling 433,651 metric tons and generating over $40 million in revenue.\nMustafa Sattar, CEO of Retex Global, Pakistan’s largest clothing grading facility, discussed the crucial role of reuse in the textile sector, emphasizing that 90% of garments are recycled without water or gas.\nDr. Abid Qaiyum Suleri, Executive Director, SDPI, lauded the initiative’s progress and expressed optimism for the future of Pakistan’s circular economy, particularly with the removal of regulatory duties on secondhand clothing.\nGovernment officials, including Umar Farooq from the Ministry of Commerce, underscored ongoing legislative efforts to establish robust regulations.\nThis workshop marks a significant step toward a more sustainable and circular textile sector in Pakistan, aligning with UNEP’s goal of minimizing environmental impact and maximizing economic opportunities in a high-impact industry.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
