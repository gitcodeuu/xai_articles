There is no doubt that PTI’s agenda seemed to be anti-Pakistan because PTI has declared the protest on this important occasion”.\nPTI once again showed its real face as the meeting of SCO was very important for Pakistan.he said.\nMuqam asked What type of image of Pakistan they wanted to highlight before the World?\n“First they postponed the visit of the President of China, now they want to sabotage the SCO meeting.\nIn any case, protest cannot be allowed on this occasion and the declaration of protest is condemnable and very sad.\nProtests and processions can be held at any other time,” he said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
