  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 27 (APP): World Day for Audiovisual Heritage was marked on October 27 (Sunday) across the globe including Pakistan to highlight the importance of preserving the moving images and sounds recordings that have captured humanity’s most significant moments.\nDifferent cultural and archives departments arranged programmes and events to highlight this year’s theme, “Your Window to the World” which emphasizes how audiovisual materials like films, radio broadcasts and television have shaped cultural understanding and recorded history in ways no other medium can.\nSince much of the history is documented in the world through digital means, the event serves as a reminder of the fragile nature of audiovisual materials, which are prone to deterioration if not properly preserved.\nFrom rare footage of global events to the voices of leaders, activists, and ordinary people, these archives form a bridge to the past, offering invaluable insights into the social, political, and cultural transformations of our time.\nThis year, cultural institutions, filmmakers, historians, and archivists from around the globe organized special screenings, panel discussions, and workshops aimed at raising awareness about the importance of safeguarding these records.\nThe main events took place at major heritage institutions, including the British Film Institute, UNESCO, and national archives, where experts will showcase newly restored works and discuss innovative techniques for audiovisual preservation.\nThe day also witnessed numerous public campaigns encouraging support for preservation efforts, reminding us that what we save today will continue to be a vital resource for generations to come.\nThe World Day for Audiovisual Heritage (WDAH) is a commemoration of the adoption, in 1980 by the 21st General Conference, of the Recommendation for the Safeguarding and Preservation of Moving Images.\nThe day provides an occasion to raise general awareness of the need to take urgent measures and to acknowledge the importance of audiovisual documents.\nIn this way, World Day also serves as an opportunity for UNESCO’s Member States to evaluate their performance with respect to implementing the 2015 Recommendation Concerning the Preservation of, and Access to, Documentary Heritage, Including in Digital Form.",
