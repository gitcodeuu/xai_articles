Despite these obstacles, our health workers continue to work bravely to vaccinate every child, he added.\nThe prime minister said that the government was improving the country’s health infrastructure, increasing vaccine coverage, and combating misinformation through our National Emergency Action Plan.\nHe said Pakistan’s regional collaboration, especially with Afghanistan, was vital to controlling the cross-border transmission.\n“This fight is about more than polio—it’s about building a robust public health system and safeguarding the health of future generations. I urge all parents to vaccinate their children and call on community leaders to spread the message of polio eradication,” Prime Minister Shehbaz remarked.\nIshtiaq Ahmed, APP’s Foreign Editor, leads coverage of the Prime Minister, President, Foreign Office, and special assignments, bringing over 20 years of journalism experience from local and international publications – Reach out at 03335293238/ ishtiaqrao@gmail.com/ X: ishtiaqrao\n\"Today, on World Polio Day, we unite to raise awareness and renew our commitment to eradicating polio—a disease that has impacted millions of children.
