The project aims to demonstrate that local climate needs can be met affordably, with strong demand for climate products and services, while offering investors financial returns on climate impact.’’\nClimaventures is poised to be a groundbreaking initiative designed to kickstart Pakistan’s climate startup ecosystem and accelerate Pakistan’s transition towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy.\nPakistani Board Member of the GCF, Nauman Bashir Bhatti said, “I congratulate NRSP for the approval of the project. Although this is Pakistan’s 9th project for which the GCF Board has approved funding, it is the first indigenously conceived and designed equity project from Pakistan’s direct access entity aimed at mobilizing the domestic private sector for climate action in Pakistan.’’\nVenture Accelerator, the foundational component with a size of USD 10 million, will provide financial and technical support to ideation-stage climate-focused businesses, helping them develop and scale their climate products.\nThe Climaventures Fund, a first-of-its-kind USD 40 million equity fund with a USD 15 million first losscovering anchor commitment from the GCF, will provide the much needed financial and strategic support to Pakistan-based early-stage climate ventures, fostering the development of scalable climate solutions across the country. Sarmayacar, the first financial institution to introduce the venture capital asset class in Pakistan, has been entrusted with managing the fund.\nTogether, the two components aim to fill a critical funding gap for climate technology start-ups, providing both technical assistance and direct venture investment to businesses working on addressing climate change –aiming to mitigate 3.5 mtCO2eq and benefit close to 6 million people of the climate-vulnerable population of Pakistan.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
