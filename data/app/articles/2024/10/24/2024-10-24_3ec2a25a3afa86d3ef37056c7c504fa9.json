Several Pakistanis were instrumental to the development of the UN and its values – from Begum Shaista Ikramullah and Ahmad Shah Bokhari, UN delegates who supported the drafting of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights and the creation of the UN agency for children, to Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq who created the Human Development Index, and Dr. Nafis Sadik, the first woman to lead one of the UN’s major voluntarily funded programme.\nThere are currently 24 UN institutions based in Pakistan, with 266 offices across the country. The UN supports the Government and People to bring about progress for all – better access to quality basic services, gender equality and women’s empowerment, climate action, economic growth and decent employment, and a more efficient governance which includes digital transformation.\nIn September this year, world leaders adopted the United Nations’ ‘Pact for the Future’ in New York. From sustainable development and climate action to digital governance and youth empowerment, it provides a comprehensive roadmap of global cooperation for addressing the most pressing issues of our time. Despite ongoing challenges, no other global organization with the legitimacy, convening power and normative impact of the UN.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
