  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): Federal Minister for Board of Investment, Privatization and Communications Abdul Aleem Khan and Federal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan on Thursday inaugurated the newly constructed bridge over the Hub River.\nThe newly constructed bridge over the Hub River on National Highway N-25, reconnecting the provinces of Balochistan and Sindh.\nThe project has been completed in two years at a cost of Rs 1.18 billion, aims to enhance connectivity and facilitate trade between the regions, said a press release issued here.\nAddressing the inauguration ceremony, Abdul Aleem Khan emphasized the importance of business activities for regional development. “We have to ensure maximum development of Balochistan, even by collecting revenue from other provinces,” he stated.\nAleem Khan noted that while Balochistan boasts the largest network of the National Highway Authority (NHA) in the country, covering 4,500 km, the province generates relatively lower toll revenue.\nThe minister expressed concerns over the bridge’s width, deeming it insufficient for current traffic demands, and announced plans for the construction of an additional parallel bridge.\nHe also approved the conversion of the N-25 highway from Karachi to Quetta into a two-way road to prevent accidents caused by traffic congestion.\n“We will build new bridges and roads in Balochistan,” Aleem Khan assured attendees, highlighting that a new bridge at Pinjara is also nearing completion.\nHe further revealed aspirations for developing a six-lane Karachi-Hyderabad motorway through a Public-Private Partnership model, alongside plans for a Northern Bypass as a major highway project.\nAleem Khan commended the National Logistics Cell (NLC) and the National Highway Authority (NHA) for their exemplary performance in the bridge’s construction and expressed optimism that this development would significantly contribute to the economic growth of the Hub area and the province.\nFederal Minister for Commerce Jam Kamal Khan echoed these sentiments, stating that the current government prioritized resolving issues of Balochistan.\nHe commended the timely completion of the Hub Bridge and extended his gratitude to Abdul Aleem Khan for his efforts.\nDuring the visit to Karachi, Abdul Aleem Khan also met with Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah to discuss highway and communication sector issues in the province.\nAt a high-level meeting presided over by Aleem Khan emphasized that financial stability in national institutions should be the top priority, urging that the NHA would enhance its resources and achieve a revenue target of Rs 25 billion for the current fiscal year. He instructed NHA officials to expedite work on 43 ongoing projects in Sindh while ensuring high-quality standards.",
