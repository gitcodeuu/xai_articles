  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): The United States (US) Ambassador to Pakistan, Donald Blome on Thursday praised the successful completion of the restoration of the historic Frere Hall, a project funded by the US Ambassadors Fund for Cultural Preservation (AFCP).\nAddressing a ceremony held at Frere Hall, Karachi, Ambassador Blome expressed his admiration for the initiative, stating that the restoration symbolizes the shared values and collaborative spirit between the US and Pakistan.\nHe said, “On behalf of the US government and the American people, it is an honor to join you today as we celebrate the completion of this remarkable project. Thanks to the AFCP, Frere Hall will continue to serve as a space for Karachi’s vibrant artistic community and as a testament to the city’s rich cultural heritage.”\nAmbassador Blome highlighted the cultural and educational significance of Frere Hall, noting that the restoration project reinforces its role as a center for civic engagement and learning in the heart of Karachi. He commended the Sindh Exploration and Adventure Society (SEAS) for their leadership in the restoration effort, led by Dr. Asma Ibrahim and Dr. Kaleemullah Lashari. The project, which spanned three years, involved local students in learning the skills of historic preservation, reflecting a commitment not only to cultural heritage but also to skill development and economic growth.\n“Restoring Frere Hall and making it structurally safer and more accessible for public gatherings like today—and for the future—is a powerful symbol of the bond between the US and Pakistan,” he remarked.\nDuring his tour of the newly restored site, Ambassador Blome admired the intricate craftsmanship of the staircase, bookshelves, and gallery, all of which have been meticulously restored. He noted that the floors and doors are a testament to the skills of the craftsmen involved in bringing the historic site back to life, ensuring that Frere Hall remains a strong cultural landmark for generations to come.\nAmbassador Blome also reflected on the broader contributions of the AFCP in Sindh, stating that the Frere Hall project marks the completion of four major cultural preservation efforts in the province. Prior projects included the restoration of the Makli Necropolis, the Varun Dev Temple on Manora Island, and the Nusserwanji Building at the Indus Valley School of Art and Architecture. He further shared that AFCP’s next focus will be on a project in Balochistan, in collaboration with the Balochistan Cultural Department, to restore the Mehrgarh Museum in Quetta.\n“I encourage all of you to think about future projects that can further strengthen the cultural preservation partnership between the US and Pakistan,” said Ambassador Blome, calling on local stakeholders to share their ideas with the US Consulate General in Karachi.\nIn closing, Ambassador Blome extended his gratitude to the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation for their support, Minister Zulfiqar Shah for attending the event, and the craftsmen and SEAS for their dedication to restoring and preserving Frere Hall.",
