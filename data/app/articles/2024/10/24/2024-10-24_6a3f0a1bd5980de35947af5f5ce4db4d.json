  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 24 (APP): The rapid growth of rooftop solar systems is transforming Pakistan’s energy landscape but also creating disparities for lower-income electricity consumers who remain dependent on the traditional grid and to address this, ensuring equitable energy access for all consumers is crucial.\nThese views were expressed by energy experts at a session titled “Navigating the Solar Surge: Ensuring Equitable Energy Access in Pakistan’s Power Sector,” hosted by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), Islamabad.\nThe session featured insights from Khalid Rahman, IPS Chairman, Ameena Sohail, senior IPS associate and energy advocate, Abubakar Ismail, head of energy & sustainability, Amreli Steels, Muhammad Musaddiq, CEO of Siddique Renewable Energy, Asad Mahmood, renewable energy expert, and Mirza Hamid Hassan, former federal secretary for Water & Power.\nWali Farooqui, research officer IPS, presented the study and pointed out that while falling solar costs have led to its mass adoption, it is mostly elite consumers benefiting from these savings.\nHe noted that this shift is creating a two-tiered energy system, where those who cannot afford solar are at an increasing disadvantage, burdened with higher bills.\nKhalid Rahman emphasized that the lack of timely amendments to net metering policies is exacerbating these inequities.\nHe called for more inclusive policy development that ensures both solar adopters and grid-dependent consumers are treated fairly.\nHe added that without assessing these changes and their broader impacts, we risk harming the majority of consumers.\nAmeena Sohail called for a reassessment of Pakistan’s energy generation planning to prioritize solar integration without jeopardizing the financial and operational stability of the grid.\nShe said that solar is commercially viable, but we need a regulatory framework that supports system stability while promoting solar adoption equitably.\nAsad Mahmood highlighted the growing divide between those who can afford solar energy and those who cannot, stressing that while solar adopters benefit from significantly lower bills, many consumers are left facing increased economic pressure.\nHe emphasized the need for clear regulations to determine how much solar the grid can handle, ensuring that its expansion doesn’t disadvantage those still reliant on traditional energy sources.\nAbubakar Ismail emphasized the importance of equitable policymaking in the transition to solar energy, highlighting the challenges posed by solar intermittency. He pointed out that while renewable energy and decarbonization are universally supported, maintaining a reliable energy supply requires continuous power, even when solar generation is not available.\nThis creates challenges for energy equity, as the maintenance of the utility’s wired network still incurs costs, which solar consumers may not be contributing to adequately.\nAdditionally, balancing frequency, voltage, and supply from the grid during nighttime adds further costs that may not be fully accounted for. He warned that without policy and regulatory frameworks, the escalating shift towards solar could lead to imbalances in grid stability, potentially leading to a “duck curve” scenario in the next two years or so.\nMuhammad Musaddiq expressed his concerns regarding the low penetration of solar energy in Pakistan, highlighting that power theft remains a significant challenge hindering progress in the sector.\nHe noted the urgent need to address the environmental damage caused by fossil fuels and emphasized that the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) and solar energy is inevitable and will continue to rise, potentially posing challenges for existing power plants.\nIn his closing remarks, Mirza Hamid Hasan underscored the importance of striking a balance between net metering consumers and those who remain dependent on the grid.\nHe stressed that while solar energy adoption is vital for the country’s energy future, it is equally important to ensure that the costs of maintaining the grid are fairly distributed.\nHasan advocated for a fair grid cost to be transferred onto net metering consumers, so that those relying on the grid are not unfairly burdened. He concluded by urging policymakers to create an equitable energy framework that supports both solar users and traditional grid consumers.\nThe session ended with a call for collaboration between stakeholders to ensure a sustainable and fair energy transition for all.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
