  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 13 (APP): Chairman Senate, Syed Yousaf Raza Gilani, said on Sunday that the fast-paced geoeconomic and geostrategic shifts at regional and global levels underscore the growing importance of economic integration.\n“It is high time to harness our collective strengths and forge a path towards sustainable growth and prosperity by promoting regional connectivity and cooperation,” he said while addressing participants at the launching ceremony of reports by the China Chamber of Commerce in Pakistan (CCCPK).\nThe Chairman lauded the reports titled “The Glorious 11 Years – How Chinese Companies Reshaped the Power Sector in Pakistan” and “Business Climate Index of Chinese Companies in Pakistan” as success stories.\n“Pakistan seeks to strengthen regional cooperation by fostering economic ties with our partner nations, and China stands at the very top,” Gilani said.\nHe highlighted Pakistan’s strategic location, abundant natural resources, and a sizeable workforce as factors that make it an attractive destination for foreign investment.\nHe stressed the importance of business-to-business linkages, noting that sustainable partnerships can attract foreign direct investment, promote technology sharing, and facilitate knowledge exchange between the two nations.\nCommending the China Chamber of Commerce in Pakistan for organizing the event, Gilani said that the reports offer valuable insights into the contributions, operational status, and investment confidence of Chinese companies in Pakistan.\n“The reports effectively showcase CCCPK’s commitment to promoting economic growth and business development in Pakistan through the efforts of 122 Chinese companies operating in the country, both state-owned and private enterprises,” he added.\nGilani said that Pakistan offers immense potential for trade, investment, and joint ventures in sectors such as energy, infrastructure, agriculture, and technology. He acknowledged the government’s role in providing a conducive environment for businesses to thrive.\nHe further praised organizations like CCCPK for paving the way toward prosperity through economic cooperation and said that local entrepreneurs and companies in Pakistan can learn a great deal from their Chinese counterparts.\nExpressing satisfaction, Gilani noted the significant role played by the Belt & Road Initiative and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) in reshaping Pakistan’s energy and infrastructure sectors.\nHe added that with CPEC entering its second phase, bilateral cooperation would further expand into areas such as agricultural modernization, industrial growth, mining and mineral exploration, science and information technology, and educational and cultural partnerships, thereby transforming Pakistan’s socioeconomic landscape.\nGilani also highlighted the importance of the Global Development Initiative, launched by President Xi Jinping in the post-COVID world, describing it as a timely move that institutionalizes cooperation required for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\n“It is a matter of satisfaction that China shares Pakistan’s aspirations in achieving the SDGs,” the Chairman said.\nHe emphasized the need to enhance people-to-people connectivity and cultural linkages to realize the shared goal of an integrated, peaceful, and cooperative region. He expressed his gratitude to Mr. Wang Huihua, Chairman of the China Chamber of Commerce in Pakistan, and his team for organizing the event.",
