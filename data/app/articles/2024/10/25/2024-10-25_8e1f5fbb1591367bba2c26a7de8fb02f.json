Genetic sequencing of the samples collected from the child is underway.\nBalochistan is facing an intense transmission of WPV1 this year.\nWhile this is the first case from Loralai of the year, four consecutive sewage samples have tested positive from the district since June, indicating that the virus is circulating there.\nThe Pakistan Polio Programme is launching a nationwide polio vaccination campaign from October 28 to vaccinate more than 45 million children under the age of five against paralytic polio.\nParents must open their doors to vaccinators during this drive and ensure that all children in their care receive two drops of the crucial oral polio vaccine to keep them protected from the devastating effects of polio.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
