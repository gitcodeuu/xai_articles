  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 25 (APP):Acting on a joint recommendation by the National Database and Registration Authority (NADRA) and the Ministry of Interior, the Federal Government took decisive action on Friday against individuals found responsible for a cybersecurity breach that compromised critical national data in March 2023.\nOn October 30, 2023, the government formed a Joint Investigation Team (JIT), headed by the Director of Cyber Crime at the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), to investigate the breach, which raised serious concerns over data security and governmental integrity.\nThe JIT, composed of cybersecurity experts, digital forensics analysts, and law enforcement officials, conducted a thorough investigation over the following months.\nIn their final report, presented to the prime minister on March 1, 2024, the team detailed the breach’s origin, identifying security lapses and vulnerabilities within NADRA’s systems. The report also provided a comprehensive account of individuals responsible for oversight failures and security protocol violations.\nIn response, the prime minister instructed the Ministry of Interior and NADRA to take immediate steps to enhance security measures, ensure system integrity, and initiate necessary disciplinary and criminal actions against those accountable for the security lapse.\nThe Ministry of Interior and NADRA are moving swiftly to execute these directives, with NADRA promptly upgrading its technology and cybersecurity protocols to prevent any future breaches.\nAdditionally, NADRA has completed the first phase of disciplinary actions, adhering strictly to internal rules and regulations. Officers identified in the JIT report as responsible for the breach have been dismissed from their posts.\nThis significant compliance step reflects NADRA’s commitment to maintaining the highest standards of data protection and accountability, aiming to restore public confidence in the organization’s ability to safeguard sensitive information.\nThe cybersecurity breach in March 2023 exposed sensitive national data and highlighted systemic weaknesses that required urgent reform. By addressing these vulnerabilities head-on and reinforcing stringent oversight, NADRA and the Federal Government aim to prevent further incidents that could threaten national security.\nThis decisive compliance action underscores the Federal Government’s zero-tolerance approach to negligence in data protection and represents a renewed dedication to enhancing cybersecurity across governmental departments.\nNADRA’s prompt action and collaboration with the FIA serve as a reminder of the importance of security, privacy, and accountability in managing the country’s sensitive data.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
