  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 25 (APP): Minister for Law, Justice and Human Rights Senator Azam Nazeer Tarar announced on Friday that, under the Bilateral Exchange Scholarships Program (Stipendium Hungaricum), a total of 367 Pakistani students have been awarded scholarships over the past three years.\nResponding to a question from Senator Shahadat Awan during the Senate session, Senator Tarar provided a provincial breakdown, stating that approximately 123 students received Stipendium Hungaricum scholarships during this period.\nIn a supplementary query, Senator Kamran Murtaza emphasized that these scholarships should be allocated to students from Balochistan based on their domicile, with verification and attestation required from the relevant Deputy Commissioner. He expressed concern that some students from more developed districts had secured scholarships using inadequate documentation, thereby depriving deserving students from less developed areas of this opportunity.\nIn response, Minister Azam Nazeer Tarar confirmed that scholarships are awarded based on students’ ID cards and domicile. He also assured that there will be enhanced verification of students’ documents prior to the award of scholarships.",
