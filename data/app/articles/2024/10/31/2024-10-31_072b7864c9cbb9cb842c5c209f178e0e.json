  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 31 (APP): Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan, WADA Mitsuhiro has hosted a reception at his Official residence in Islamabad to bid farewell to Pakistani dignitaries and friends.\nAmbassador WADA is going to leave Pakistan on 19th November and will take up his new assignment as Ambassador of Japan to Croatia. He assumed his office in October 2021, since when he has served as the Ambassador of Japan to Pakistan for more than three years.\nLooking back at his tenure, Ambassador WADA said, ‘Pakistan is a country that is very friendly to Japan. But I’ve tried not to take this for granted and have made various efforts in economic cooperation, cultural exchange and personal interaction to further deepen the historical ties between our two countries.’\nThis year marks the 70th anniversary of Japan’s official development assistance (ODA) to Pakistan.\nAmbassador WADA reiterated the importance of human aspects in Japan’s ODA, saying, ‘we always seek to work together with the local people and eventually encourage them to stand on their own. Rather than just providing money or goods, JICA tries to run alongside the Pakistanis and help them become the driving force of development. The key is the people, and Pakistan is blessed with such talents.’\nHe also mentioned the significance of cultural and people-to-people exchange and hoped that cultural organizations such as Pakistan Japan Cultural Association (PJCA), Lahore Arts Foundation Trust, Lahore Sogetsu Study Group and Lahore Bonsai Society, as well as those who had studied in Japan including the MEXT Scholarship alumni, will continue bridging the gap between Pakistan and Japan, he added.\nAmbassador WADA further stressed that he had met a lot of wonderful people who worked passionately to strengthen Japan-Pakistan relations. He said, ‘I am now convinced that without the support of these great people, the friendship between Japan and Pakistan would have been impossible. I am deeply grateful to all of you.’\nReferring to the difficult political, economic and security situations in Pakistan today, Ambassador WADA firmly said, ‘I know very well how patient and resilient the Pakistani people are and how big the potential of this country is.\nOnce the elite – politicians, the judiciary, the establishment and others – and the common people come together on the same cause and work hard to solve the problems, I do not doubt that Pakistan will overcome these difficulties and firmly develop in the long term.’\nHe reiterated Japan’s commitment to support such efforts of Pakistan in the coming years and decades.\nAmbassador AKAMATSU Shuichi, former Consul-General of Japan in Shanghai, will arrive in Pakistan in late November to succeed Ambassador WADA.\nIn addition, Minister TAKANO Shuichi, now Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy of Japan in Brazil, will also succeed Minister ITO Takeshi in late November.\nAmbassador WADA hoped that his friends in Pakistan would extend their generous support to Ambassador and Mrs. AKAMATSU, Minister and Mrs. TAKANO as they have done for themselves.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
