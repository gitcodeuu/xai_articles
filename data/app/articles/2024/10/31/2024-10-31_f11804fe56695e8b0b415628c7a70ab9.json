Project Watchmaker is a critical part of the global strategy to prevent these actors from causing catastrophic damage,” said DG Jehangir. He further emphasized the role of the National Central Bureau (NCB) INTERPOL, Islamabad, in providing timely intelligence and resources essential for national security.\nDG Jehangir also extended his appreciation to the officers from the provincial police forces, NACTA, and the National Forensic Science Agency for their active involvement, and commended the FIA’s Counter-Terrorism Wing (CTW) for its relentless efforts in handling complex terrorism cases.\nThe meeting concluded with a certificate ceremony led by DG FIA, recognizing participants for their contributions, followed by a ceremonial exchange of souvenirs, symbolizing the collaborative commitment to combatting terrorism.\nThe event marks a pivotal step in reinforcing Pakistan’s security capabilities and furthering international cooperation to combat chemical and explosive threats on a global scale.",
