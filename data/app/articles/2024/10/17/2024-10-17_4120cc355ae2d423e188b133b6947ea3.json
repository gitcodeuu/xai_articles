  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting, National Heritage, and Culture, Attaullah Tarar, on Thursday accused the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) of poisoning political traditions and culture through a well-organized campaign.\nSpeaking on the floor of the National Assembly, he said the country’s political traditions were untainted in the past, but PTI has poisoned them through a specific campaign.\nHe expressed regret, stating that it was unfortunate the opposition members lacked the tolerance to listen to differing viewpoints.\nHe said that all political parties in Pakistan participated in the All Parties Conference (APC) to show solidarity with Palestine, except for PTI, which refused to attend. He further alleged that PTI was running a malicious campaign against national institutions and their leadership.\nHe said, no one had taken note of their silence on Goldsmith, who has openly supported Israel and tweeted against the people of Palestine.\nHe also accused the opposition members of never speaking out against the atrocities committed by Israel against the innocent people of Palestine.\nTarar said that with the help of NGOs, the government had sent relief items to Gaza and Lebanon to support the war-ravaged people.\nHe also criticized the PTI for writing letters to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to push Pakistan towards default, orchestrating the May 9 attacks, vandalizing memorials of martyrs, and calling for protests during the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit. Despite the PTI efforts, the government successfully conducted the event in Islamabad, he added.\nTarar recalled that although the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan People’s Party (PPP) had been political opponents, there was decorum and mutual respect between both parties. He cited how Nawaz Sharif was the first leader to visit the hospital after Benazir Bhutto was martyred, demonstrating respect across political lines.\n“PTI’s founder turned political opposition into enmity,” the minister added, stressing that the political tolerance of the\nPML-N had been perceived as weakness.\nHe said, when the PTI Chairman was injured after falling from a crane, Muhammad Nawaz Sharif suspended his election campaign and personally visited him at Shaukat Khanum Hospital. “After the elections, Nawaz Sharif himself visited Bani Gala and advocated for working together for the betterment of the country,” he added.\nThe minister also recounted how, during Muhammad Nawaz Sharif’s imprisonment, he was denied a phone call to his ailing wife. He accused PTI of introducing a culture of dragging women into political disputes, citing the midnight arrest of Faryal Talpur from a hospital and Maryam Nawaz’s arrest on false charges in front of her father.\nHe mentioned how fake cases were filed against the families of Abdul Aleem Khan and Jahangir Khan Tareen, and how Rana Sanaullah was arrested in a fabricated case.\nTarar recalled the time when Nawaz Sharif and Shehbaz Sharif mother passed away, yet a judge insisted on continuing cross-examinations.\n“Today, the PTI cries foul, claiming political victimization of women, but they crossed all limits during their tenure,” he said. He also accused the PTI of dissolving national and the provincial assemblies and violating the Constitution and the law during their time in power.\nHe also highlighted the situation in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, where PTI allegedly abducted and detained its people. “The empty benches here today—were they cleared by the police or Rangers?” he questioned.\nTarar referred to PTI’s recent threats of dire consequences if anyone betrayed their leader. He expressed concern over these threats, particularly in relation to supporting constitutional amendments. “No one will be allowed to take the law into their own hands. The writ of the state will be established,” he asserted.\nDescribing the period from 2018 to 2022 as the darkest time in Pakistan’s political history, Tarar said PTI’s entire approach was based on retaliatory politics. He noted that PTI was uncomfortable with the arrival of 12 world leaders in Pakistan, which restored the country’s role in the region and ended its international isolation.\nDespite political victimization, he said, “Shehbaz Sharif had proposed a ‘Charter of Economy’ to the PTI government.” However, the offer was rejected due to ego and arrogance of the then prime minister.\nToday, he added, Pakistan was put on the path of progress. “Pakistan has received $8.8 billion in remittances, inflation has decreased to a single digit, the interest rate has fallen to 17.5 percent, exports have increased, IT exports have reached $3.2 billion, and foreign exchange reserves are growing.”\n“Pakistan comes first; no political party is bigger than the country,” he said adding if anyone thought he or she was bigger than Pakistan, he/she had no right to do politics in this country.\nHe highlighted the successful conclusion of the SCO Summit, which helped restore Pakistan’s global image. Visiting dignitaries praised Pakistan’s key role in the region and commended the excellent arrangements for the summit.",
