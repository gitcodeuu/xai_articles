  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 17 (APP): The Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) on Thursday turned down PTI’s request for an additional week time to respond in the Islamabad Election Tribunal case involving three constituencies in the federal capital.\nA four-member bench headed by Chief Election Commissioner Sikandar Sultan Raja heard the case regarding the PML-N winning MNAs’ request to transfer the cases of three Islamabad constituencies to another election tribunal.\nPTI candidate Shoaib Shaheen requested a week’s extension as the case was pending in the High Court, where notices had already been issued. However, the Chief Election Commissioner rejected the request, stating that an extension could only be granted if the court had halted the process.\nThe counsel for PML-N MNA Dr. Tariq Fazal Chaudhary reminded the Election Commission that it possessed the authority to change the tribunal and was not a judicial body, highlighting that the Election Commission was a constitutional entity.\nTariq Fazal Chaudhary’s counsel stated that they had expressed the same concerns in the previous hearing, indicating a lack of trust in the tribunal judge and claiming that the tribunal did not follow the proper procedure.\nElection Commission member Nisar Durrani responded by asking if they were asserting that the failure to adhere to tribunal procedures was a valid reason for changing the tribunal.\nThe lawyer responded affirmatively, stating that it was indeed the same issue.\nHe emphasized that the tribunal has a responsibility to act in accordance with the Election Act, and until the tribunal enforces sections 142 to 146 of the Act, it cannot summon them.\nThe Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) adjourned the hearing until Friday.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
