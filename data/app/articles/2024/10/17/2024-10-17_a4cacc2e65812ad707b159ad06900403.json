Every citizen of Pakistan is filled with a spirit of sacrifice and is ready to defend the country at any cost.”\nChaudhry Jaffar highlighted the crucial role of journalists in these challenging times, saying, “Journalists are the eyes and ears of society, and we appreciate their efforts.”\nHe further remarked that the leadership of the PML-N has always been dedicated to public service, with a history of advancing the nation’s progress and improving the quality of life for its people. “Despite the current challenging circumstances, both the federal and provincial governments are doing their utmost to provide relief to the people, utilizing all available resources for public welfare. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and Punjab Chief Minister Maryam Nawaz deserve praise for their commitment to fulfilling the vision of party president Muhammad Nawaz Sharif,” Chaudhry Jaffar added.\nRana Imran Latif, who was accompanied with President of Rahim Yar Khan District Press Club, Qaisar Ghafoor Chaudhry, noted that the biggest challenge facing the country today is political wrangling.
