  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 01 (APP):The Senate Standing Committee on Petroleum on Tuesday rejected the proposed privatization of the Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC), voicing concerns over potential job losses.\nChaired by Senator Umer Farooq, the committee warned of the risk to 5,000 jobs if privatization proceeds.\nSenator Manzoor Ahmed questioned the need for privatization, asserting that PMDC has been profitable over the past three years and urging the government to prioritize local employees. He argued that the corporation should not be privatized if it is not incurring losses.\nIn response, the Petroleum Authority clarified that PMDC’s inclusion in the privatization list aligns with the SOES Act 2023, and the decision was made by the cabinet.\nThe PMDC remains fully owned by the Federation, although concerns were raised by Senator Ahmed, who pointed out that the land was leased rather than owned outright by the Federation.\nHe also highlighted the need for modernization of PMDC’s outdated machinery, which has contributed to 80 fatalities over five years.\nSenator Qurat-ul-Ain Marri raised the issue of provincial consultation, questioning how the Federation could privatize land belonging to the provinces without their input.\nThe Secretary of Petroleum clarified that only the corporate entity, not the leased land, was being privatized, and that further clarity would emerge once a financial advisor was appointed.\nThe committee also reviewed delays in the gas supply project for Gulistan Tehsil in Qilla Abdullah, which was inaugurated in 2015.\nSenator Abdul Shakoor Khan pointed out that a 5 km area was excluded from the project, preventing its initiation. The Director General of Gas informed the committee that Rs 500 million has been allocated for a 22 km gas pipeline, but progress has been hindered by a ban on additional gas connections imposed since 2021.\nSenator Manzoor Ahmed raised concerns about villages along the pipeline route not receiving gas. In response, Senator Marri suggested implementing a policy to prioritize gas provision to areas adjacent to pipelines. The committee chair agreed that the gas connection policy required revision.\nThe committee also discussed dealer margins and operational policies for petroleum dealers. Representatives highlighted that banks deduct fees from fuel sales, such as 80 paisa for every Rs 100 in sales.\nThe Chairman of OGRA explained that while OGRA sets margins for Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs) and dealers, credit card deductions are a matter between dealers and banks.\nThe committee directed the Petroleum Dealers Association and OGRA to collaborate to resolve the issues, noting that the dealer margin had been set at Rs 8.64 last year, which included franchise fees.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
