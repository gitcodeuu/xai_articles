  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 01 (APP): The National Assembly’s Standing Committee on Information Technology & Telecommunication Tuesday expressed serious concerns over the slow progress of the 5G spectrum auction and directed the Ministry of IT to expedite the hiring of consultants.\nThe meeting, chaired by Syed Amin ul Haque, MNA, emphasized the need for swift action to meet the 2025 target for launching 5G services.\nRecognizing the necessity for comprehensive reforms in the telecom sector, the committee stressed the importance of involving all stakeholders in the design of the auction, spectrum valuation, and the development of appropriate 5G models.\n“The timely completion of the auction is seen as critical to Pakistan’s technological advancement,” it added.\nThe committee also raised concerns about the unresolved property dispute between PTCL and Etisalat, which had lingered for 18 years.\nThe ministry informed the committee that a special task force, led by the Finance Minister, had been established by the Prime Minister to address the issue, with progress being made towards a resolution, and its detailed report on any final decisions was awaited.\nThe committee sought a comprehensive overview of PTCL properties leased or rented at its next meeting.\nIt also directed the PTCL to enhance its complaint management system, ensuring a swift response time of 6 to 12 hours to prevent customer dissatisfaction and maintain competitiveness in the market.\nThe slow progress of the Islamabad IT Park project was another point of concern. Originally slated for completion by February 2025, only 44% of the work has been completed so far.\nWith the project fully funded by the Korean Government and delays occurring due to prolonged approval processes, the committee called for a third-party audit of the project, demanding that the evaluation report be presented at the next meeting.\nIt was told that the Ministry had involved the Korean Ambassador to ensure the project remains on track.\nRegarding the Karachi IT Park project, the committee directed the Ministry to expedite construction work and implement a three-shift schedule to ensure the project’s completion by June 2026.",
