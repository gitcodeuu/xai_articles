Zain-ul-Abidin was found to be using a fake visa for Albania, which he had obtained for 3 million rupees from an agent named Malik Sikandar in Gujranwala. The suspect first traveled to Azerbaijan, where he received the counterfeit visa, and attempted to travel to Albania via Dubai. However, Dubai authorities intercepted him, and he was deported to Pakistan.\nBoth suspects have been handed over to the Anti-Human Smuggling Circle in Gujranwala for further legal action, according to an FIA spokesperson.
