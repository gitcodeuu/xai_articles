He emphasized that the day would also honour the victims of genocide committed by the Israeli regime.\nHe further said the ‘Day of Solidarity with Palestine’ would be a global symbol of the Palestinian nation’s fight for freedom, resilience against occupation, and defiance against tyranny. “This initiative will shine on the global calendar as a day of resistance and self-determination,” the envoy remarked.\nDr. Moghadam also highlighted the significance of this day in raising global awareness. He urged countries for concrete steps to condemn the Zionist regime’s atrocities against humanities. “It is the demand of the supporters of the Palestinian cause worldwide to embrace and support this initiative by recognizing October 7 annually as the ‘Day of Solidarity with Palestine,’” he added.",
