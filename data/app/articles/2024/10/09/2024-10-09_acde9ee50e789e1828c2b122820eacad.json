  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 9 (APP):In a significant development aimed at simplifying the attestation process for students, the Inter Boards Coordination Commission (IBCC) has been striving to connect its attestation portal with the database of BISEs of the country for direct verification of records.\nAccording to a press release of IBCC on Wednesday, Federal Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (FBISE), Baluchistan Board of Intermediate and Secondar Education (BBISE) and many of the education boards of Punjab have already been connected.\nAnother milestone achieved as the IBCC and Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education (BISE) Peshawar have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for data sharing.\nThe agreement will enable IBCC to access BISE Peshawar’s data through read-only access via APIs, streamlining the verification process for attestation purposes.\nThe MoU was signed by Dr. Ghulam Ali Mallah, Executive Director, IBCC, and Prof. Nasrullah Khan Yousufzai, Chairman BISE Peshawar. The Controller BISE Peshawar, Directors of IBCC, and IT teams of both organizations were also present at the occasion.\nThis initiative will eliminate the need to physically visit BISE Peshawar to get verification in a sealed envelope, which was previously required for document attestation by IBCC. This will also pave the way for other boards of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to connect with IBCC and benefit students across Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK).\n“This initiative will save students both time and money by providing online verification services. Now, students can get their documents verified online and apply for attestation without any hassle,” said Dr. Ghulam Ali Mallah. He highlighted that the online system will significantly reduce the commute costs for students, making the process more efficient.\nProf. Nasrullah Khan, emphasized that BISE Peshawar will act as the focal point in guiding other BISEs of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in technical developments for establishing connectivity with IBCC’s attestation portal benefiting all students in KPK. “Students from across the province will be able to obtain online verification of their educational documents, streamlining the process for all BISEs in KPK.”\nProf. Nasrullah Khan and his team also gave an elaborative presentation regarding the development of the Feedback Mechanism designed and developed by the IT team of BISE Peshawar. The tool will help the authorities make informed decisions based on its report and also indicate areas where improvement is required.\nDr Mallah expressed that he intends to share the progress of BISE Peshawar with other members of the IBCC forum encouraging them to implement such developments and systems in their boards.\nThis initiative marks a positive step toward modernizing education-related services, making it easier for students to focus on their academic and career goals.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
