want to make it clear that we believe in peace in the region and we are showing maximum patience and tolerance and peace,” he said.\nThe prime minister said Pakistan did not want any conflict in the region, however he made it clear that the country was fully capable of strongly retaliating any attack from the neighborly country.\nIn this regard, he said India had for many times checked our

the aspiration of the people of Indian Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) and relevant resolutions of the United Nations.\nHe said the Kashmir issue had not been resolved so far mainly due to stubbornness of India and its violations of human rights and international laws.\nCaretaker Federal Minister for Information, Broadcasting and Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi while delivering his speech at Kashmir Solidarity Day rally said that every generation of Kashmir had created a new story of courage, bravery and steadfastness by resisting illegal Indian occupation of their homeland.\nHe said the people of Kashmir had been raising their voice against slavery since 1931 during the Dogra rule.\nPaying tributes to the sacrifices of the Kashmiri people, he said their fourth

world for expressing solidarity with the oppressed people of IIOJK who were running their legitimate, political and peaceful indigenous and just struggle for the right to self-determination and liberation as per the UN resolution for the past many decades.\n“Today people are talking about apartheid in Gaza because their footage is going viral but it should be remembered that there has been a more serious escalation in human rights abuses in IIOJK against innocent Kashmiris. Hundreds of thousands of people have rendered their lives for the cause of freedom,” she added.\nMullick said the Indian occupant forces were using pellet guns, white phosphorous, and rape as war weapons against women, TARA, POTA, UPA, and Armed Forces Special Act-type laws were imposed in IIOJK that gave immunity to the Indian RSS forces.\nShe urged the world that they were running out of time as India had scaled up its settling of non-Kashmiri residents in the occupied valley to the demography of Kashmir and had issued five million domiciles to non-state residents so far.",
