  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 2 (APP):The World Wetlands Day was observed across the globe including in Pakistan on Friday.\nThe theme for the day this year was “Wetlands and human wellbeing”. Its goal is to highlight how all aspects of human wellbeing “physical, mental, and environmental” are tied to the health of the world’s wetlands.\nWetlands cover only six percent of the earth, but more than forty percent of animal and plant species live and breed in wetlands.\nThe Ramsar Convention, named after the Iranian city of Ramsar, was an international treaty for the conservation of wetlands.\nThe treaty was signed on February 2, 1971. Since then, the day is observed.\nOn August 30, 2021, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 75/317 and hence established February 2 as World Wetlands Day.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
