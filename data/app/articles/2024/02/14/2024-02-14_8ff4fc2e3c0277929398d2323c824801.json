We want to create a community of practitioners that is well equipped with developing trends and knowledge to tackle intricacies of managing climate-induced disasters and challenges,” he said.\nClimate Finance is a new area for Pakistan which is not new but rather late explored by the country and the FIPs should work on developing their capacities in gauging the\nThe first day of the workshop focused on accreditation process and the second day provided insights to the participants on project proposal development.\nAccreditation Lead & DM Procurement, NDRMF, Amina Sadaf opened the second day proceedings with her opening remarks.\nShe said that the workshop had been convened at the completion of the first batch of the fund’s projects which was successfully achieved .\nShe invited the representatives of the Muslim Aid Pakistan, Islamic Relief Pakistan, and Agha Khan Foundation who had completed various projects in multifaceted domains of education, WASH (water, sanitation and Hygiene), livelihoods, climate change, food security, shelter, disaster risk management, and many others.\nAt the conclusion of the workshop, CEO Bilal Anwar said the overwhelming participation of the partners which were beyond three dozen in number was encouraging.\nHowever, the community representatives’ messages displayed by the FIPs provided heartening and powerful messages that should be promoted further.\nThe NDRMF was working on establishing its “Data Center” that would be a repository of data and information for all, he said, adding, “the NDMA also did the similar thing and built its National Emergency Operations Center (NEOC).”\nHe added that the workshop served as a great platform for institutional strengthening of partners, their alignment with NDRMF’s new features and enhance their understanding to bring constructive projects.\n“We are heading towards multidimensional and multisectoral projects, whereas Rs10 billion worth 12 projects are already underway,” he added.\nThe workshop participants also visited the NEOC of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and received a detailed briefing on its working and procedures during disaster risk modelling.\nThe workshop had focused on the lessons learnt sharing, challenges and key takeaways, highlighting key areas of accreditation overview eligibility criteria, regulatory and legal regimes, financial management and internal controls, project procurement management, disaster risk reduction and climate change mitigation among others.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
