We expect the backlog to clear over the next few days. We appreciate public’s understanding during this time of transition.”\nEarlier this week, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also opened its Liaison Office in Gujrat, which is expected to relieve pressure on the Lahore Liaison Office.\nThe Ministry of Foreign Affairs remains committed to facilitate the public and to provide efficient and timely consular services.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
