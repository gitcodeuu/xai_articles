Privacy and security concerns, though less of a barrier for work-related mobile use, remain significant, with 32% expressing worry.\nThese findings underscore the complex relationship Pakistanis have with their mobile devices, balancing the benefits of enhanced productivity with the challenges of maintaining digital well-being and security.\nKhurram Ashfaque, CEO of Telenor Pakistan, reflects, “The latest Telenor Asia Digital Lives Decoded study unveils a transformative shift.\nMobile technology is reshaping work dynamics, nurturing skill acquisition, and priming for substantial economic growth.\nTogether, with robust connectivity, embracing emerging tech, and enhancing digital literacy, we have the power to propel Pakistan towards a safer, more inclusive digital future.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
