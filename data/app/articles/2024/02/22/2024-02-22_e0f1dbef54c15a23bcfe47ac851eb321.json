We need to highlight policy endeavours for Islamabad specifically as it faced unprecedented urban flooding phenomenon in its history. There 43 slums in its out of which 10 are being regularized that lacked proper amenities of water and sanitation,” she added.\nShe commended the Ministry officials for their well-written and detailed brief in response to her query.\nSecretary MoCC&EC, Asif Hyder Shah told the Committee that the federal capital owing to its small territory was performing better than the provinces in the areas of air pollution index, surface water treatment and others.\nHe added that the Ministry’s nomenclature and location was changed five times that made its restructuring a challenge for him whereas the Ministry had hired climate experts equal to the number of its civil service staff to ensure better and well-planned tasks.\nHe mentioned that the flagship Living Indus Initiative was going to be awarded the UN’s Award in March 2024.\nCommenting on the Capital Development Authority (CDA) and IWMB rift, he said it was a mater of land ownership between the two entities with the Islamabad Zoo management as the bone of contention.\n“Ministry of Interior has moved a summary to the Cabinet for reclaiming the Zoo, whereas the MoCC&EC is supporting the IWMB as the CDA has already had its hands full due to its multiple operations,” he said.\nShah suggested the Committee to give recommendations to maintain the Zoo’s ownership with the IWMB that will endorse the MoCC&EC stance at the Cabinet forum.\nSenator Humayun Mohmand said the ICT should be declared as a province directly governed by the Prime Minister to be treated as separately for better policy implementation.\nHe congratulated the chair and MoCC&EC team for being cooperative and working for solutions to the significant environmental issues of the country.\nHe added that the political will needed to be strengthened through consensus among the political parties to resolve the environment-related issues.\nSenator Taj Haider also appreciated the forum for its successful completion of the term and raised concerned related to 2022 flood-affected areas and urged the Secretary to work out federal government’s role in furthering support in the reconstruction process.\nSenator Khalida Ateeb said the Climate Committee should be assigned to the officials and senators who have been running this body for a long time to ensure consistency of action.\nSenators Keshoo Bai and Abida Muhammad Azeem also attended the meeting.",
