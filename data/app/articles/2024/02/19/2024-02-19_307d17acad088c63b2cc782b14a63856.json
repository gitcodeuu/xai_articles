The officials from the Ministry of Housing and Works clarified that the delay in the projects stemmed from technical issues. One of the reason for the postponement of the two-day auction of class-III commercial plots in sector G-13/G-14 and the fuel station plot in the Mauve Area is that a writ petition was filed by Quaid-e-Azam University (Q.A.U), claiming a share in the sale proceeds from the auction of commercial plots in G-14/4 and the Mauve Area.\nDG Zafar Iqbal further explained that they were compliant with the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) and were persistent in expediting the auction before Ramazan, but they were given two options either to dispose of this case or to give sufficient time to the university.\nIt was reported that G-14/1 and G-14/2 and G-14/3 are partially completed with an approved project cost of Rs. 6127.90 million for G-14/1 and Rs. 1499.43 million for G-14/2 and G-14/3, while G-15/3 is partially completed with 404 plots available for possession, and the approved cost of the project is Rs. 1,453.866 million.\nThey highlighted that the contract for the land in G-14-1, which is pending, has encountered significant Build up Property resulting in the cancellation of plots. However, they noted that 50 Kanal (1 percent) of G-14-1 has been cleared. Furthermore, they emphasized that G-14 has been allotted to the federal government, and the G-15 residential area has been reserved for the affectees. Additionally, they mentioned that the cost of planning and development has been levied on the affectees.\nThe committee members were provided record of Chaklala Heights, including its layout plan and details of consultant hiring and their current status. The DG FGEHA expressed that Chaklala is not a lucrative site, and its rates have also risen after COVID-19.\nThe chairman of the committee also inquired about the job quota, deputation rules, and the status of employees in FGEHA. Additionally, he also asked about the actions taken against officials involved in violating prescribed job quota.\nSenators Saifullah Sarwar Khan Nyazee, Fida Muhammad, Khalida Ateeb, Saifullah Abro, Molana Abdul Ghafoor Haideri, Afnan Ullah Khan, the Secretary of the Ministry of Housing and Works, DG FGEHA, and the senior officials from the Ministry of Housing and Works also participated in the meeting.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
