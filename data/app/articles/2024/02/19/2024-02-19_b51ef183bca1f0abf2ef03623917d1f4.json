Therefore, it is incumbent upon every Muslim to read and reflect on the message of the Holy Quran and follow the teachings of the Holy Qur’an in their practical lives.\n“Noting that the wisdom of the Holy Quran paves the way for a scientific revolution in the fields of medicine, artificial intelligence, robotics, space research and other areas.\n“Observing with a serious concern that MPhil and PhD programmes of various varsities are confined to imparting conservative knowledge of Islam and history.
