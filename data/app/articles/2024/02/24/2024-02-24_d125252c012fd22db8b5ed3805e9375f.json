  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 24 (APP):President Muslim Conference and ex-Premier AJK Sardar Attique Ahmed Khan has said that the great keenness of overseas workers to contribute to the economic boost of Pakistan needs to be harnessed with national economic planning and execution apparatus.\nHe was briefing the political and youth delegation who called on him in his Mujahid Manzil residence Saturday to congratulate him on his successful 10-day public interactive tour of the United Arab Emirates.\n“Our national economic planners should ensure a greater working role for overseas workers in Pakistan’s economic planning and execution processes”, he stressed.\n“I feel the urgency of forming Pakistan economic councils comprising overseas workers and investors having working advisory facilitation in the national economic development initiatives. Pakistan’s and Kashmir’s manpower overseas showed great keenness to contribute to Pakistan’s economic strength. Their enthusiasm needs to be channelized in our national efforts sooner the better”, he pointed out.\nRegarding growing anti-Kashmir and anti-Kashmiri atrocities by India in occupied Kashmir, he said that the international opinion is well informed of ill designs of India in the region. “In my interactive meetings during my 10-day UAE visit, I pointed out that under UN Kashmir resolutions Indian presence in Kashmir is illegal. India is alien in Kashmir. She is Kashmir’s occupier. Over one million Indian armed forces today occupying Kashmir are busy reducing the Kashmiri demography in the state”, he said.\nIndia has seen that even after jailing hundreds of thousands of Kashmiri nationals, youth, women and teens Kashmiris continue their self-determination rights movement with full political and moral might. India is stealing the geographic resources of the state, depriving Kashmiris of their economic and political rights, he added.\nIn this inimical circumstance how can she stay in Jammu and Kashmir, he queried.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
