  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 19 (APP): Caretaker Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Murtaza Solangi on Monday informed the Senate that the Parliament had not framed any policy or guidelines for the implementation of the recommendations suggested by the Council of Islamic Ideology (CII) in its annual reports.\nHe was responding to a motion moved by Senator Mushtaq Ahmed of the Jamaat-i-Islami Pakistan (JIP) to discuss the non-presentation of the CII’s annual report under clause (4) of Article 230 of the Constitution in the House, strategy for implementation of recommendations of these reports and the steps being taken by the government in this regard.\nSolangi said under clause (4) of Article 230 of the Constitution, the CCI annual reports had been tabled in both the Houses of the Parliament.\nThe government had fulfilled its responsibility, but nothing was recommended to the government by the Parliament for their implementation, he added.\n“If the Parliament approves any policy or guidelines in this regard then the government as per the Rules of Business 1973 will ensure their implementation,” the minister assured.\nPresenting the motion, Senator Mushtaq Ahmed said that the CII released its 733-page annual report in 2019-20. He paid tribute to the Council chairman and staff who strived to create the tedious document giving 53 strategic recommendations, which, he claimed, was not tabled in the Senate.\nHe added that the CII considered Parliament as supreme, but it was acting a source providing guidance to the Parliament in the light of Quran and Sunnah as per its constitutional mandate.\nHe said that the report shed light on the constitutional amendment bills, recommendations, human rights especially of women, children and minorities, and a roadmap for an Islamic economic system against the interest-based system.\n“There are many strategic recommendations in this report that are not read by the government and the Parliament,” he regretted.\nThe senator urged the government to ensure the lanuch of CII Report launch at the forum of Parliament and provincial assemblies every year.\n“The easily doable actions recommended in the report should be promptly adopted through executive orders that do not need legislation,” he suggested.\nHe also proposed that a joint committee of the members of the Senate and the National Assembly be formed to finalize proposals for the implementation of the CCI’s recommendations.",
