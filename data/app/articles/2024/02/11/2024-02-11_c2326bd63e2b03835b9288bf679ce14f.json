However, during the medical examination, the female leopard cub was found to have severe dehydration along with skin infections, he said.\n“The condition of the female leopard cub is out of danger due to the provision of emergency medical facilities. The IWMB has chosen Lucky as the name of the female leopard cub because it was successfully kept alive. Lucky has also started taking her meal and will be transferred to the Rescue and Rehabilitation Center in the next few days after providing veterinary medical care,” the IWMB official said.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
