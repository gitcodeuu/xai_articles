However, the court accepted applications of the accused and exempted them from personal appearance for one-day. The court adjourned further hearing till February 12 and summoned all the accused for indictment on the next date of hearing.\nThe court had summoned all the accused for indictment after distribution of copies of challan at the last hearing. The ACE Punjab had registered the case, accusing Parvez Elahi of unlawful appointments and kickbacks.
