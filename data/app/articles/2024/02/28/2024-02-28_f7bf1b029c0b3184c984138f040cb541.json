  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 28 (APP):At the 5G beyond Growth Summit hosted by Huawei at MWC Barcelona 2024, Li Peng, Huawei’s Corporate Senior Vice President and President of ICT Sales & Service, discussed the path to business success in 5G and the potential of 5.5G commercialization.\nThe advent of 5G networks has emerged as a powerful catalyst for innovation in the global mobile industry. “5G is on the right path to business success,” said Li. 5G began commercialization in 2019, and over the past five years, it has already gained 1.5 billion 5G users around the world. It took nine years for 4G to make this happen said a news release received here on Wednesday.\nCurrently, 20% of global mobile subscribers are using 5G. These users generate 30% of all mobile traffic and contribute to 40% of mobile service revenue.\nLi explained, “5.5G is entering commercial use in 2024, and as 5.5G, AI, and cloud converge, carriers can unlock the potential of new applications and capabilities.”\nHe went on to say that carriers around the world should focus on high-quality networking, multi-dimensional monetization, emerging services, and generative AI to grasp these opportunities.\nMobile users have proven willing to purchase experience upgrades for their mobile packages if their networks are high enough quality. The traffic generated by these users is, therefore, expected to significantly increase, allowing carriers to maximize the value of traffic. This has led to more and more carriers proposing strategic goals that include the construction of high-quality 5G networks.\nOperators can provide tailored solutions with new differentiated services leveraging 5G and edge to diverse industries and enterprises. Tailoring solutions to meet the specific needs of diverse industries and enterprises will help align costs with revenues. Some carriers in the Middle East, for example, have already deployed Massive MIMO networks, and the optimal experience delivered by these networks has made the 5G FWA rollout a success. Currently, 5G FWA has connected nearly 3 million households, making it a powerful engine of revenue growth for carriers.\nMore than 20% of global 5G carriers have already adopted speed-tiered pricing models. One carrier in Thailand, for example, recently released a 5G Boost Mode add-on, which allows subscribers to select different speed tiers to best meet their usage needs. This model has helped the carrier increase its ARPU by about 23%. Another Chinese carrier has launched a guaranteed uplink package to provide live-streamers with smooth, high-definition live streaming experiences.\nThe package has become quite popular and helped the carrier increase its ARPU by more than 70%.\nNew services like New Calling, cloud phones, and glasses-free 3D are getting more and more attention from consumers. For example, New Calling’s value-added functions, like virtual avatars, are becoming quite popular. Users are also willing to pay more for services that deliver real-time experience, such as one-stop car insurance claims.\nMany industries have also adopted 5G. In China, more than 50,000 private 5G network use cases have entered commercial use in over 50 industries. The new capabilities of 5.5G, including deterministic latency, precise positioning, and passive IoT, are expected to create even more opportunities for carriers in the B2B market.\nLi closed his remarks at the summit by promising, “Together with carriers, we will unlock the potential of 5G and 5.5G and drive incredible new growth.”\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
