These programs are widely acknowledged for their success and have served as a model and inspiration for similar initiatives in South Asia, including India.\nShoaib Sultan Khan elucidated multiple factors that contribute to the success of such programs including long-term political commitment, poverty eradication as a common political agenda, political support and ownership, sustained governmental support, institutional development, innovation and adaptation, and participation of women.\nDuring his remarks, he brought attention to four essential elements of the success of a rural support program; (i) the willingness of the households to organize and enable their potential; (ii) a competent community leader with social mobilization vision; (iii) professional, dedicated and committed support organization; and (iv) availability and commitment of resources.\nHe further said that the continued success of rural support programs hinges on the active engagement of households, encouraging them to embrace a collaborative mindset for sustainable development.\nEarlier, in her welcome remarks, Director of the Centre for Strategic Perspectives (CSP), Dr Neelum Nigar mentioned that under the TLF, ISSI acknowledges and pays tribute to individuals esteemed as authoritative voices in specific fields.\nThese individuals have played a crucial role in shaping perspectives, influencing decisions, and driving innovation within their respective domains in Pakistan.\nShe added that Shoaib Sultan Khan stands as a testament to this spirit of thought leadership, and ISSI is privileged to have him share his insights on this platform.\nDG ISSI Ambassador Sohail Mahmood, in his welcome remarks, paid rich tributes to Shoaib Sultan Khan’s vision, transformational leadership, and outstanding contribution to efforts for poverty reduction in Pakistan and the region, including in India, through community participation.\nHe added that Shoaib Sultan Khan’s life-long work had made a difference in the lives of millions and was duly recognised in Pakistan and internationally.\nAmbassador Sohail Mahmood noted that Pakistan has made significant strides in reducing absolute poverty, with rates dropping from 61.6% in 1998-99 to 21.5% in 2021-22. However, multidimensional poverty remains high at 39%, highlighting deprivation in health, education, and standard of living.\nHe said recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and floods, have exacerbated these challenges, particularly affecting rural communities where necessities are scarce. Shoaib Sultan Khan has been instrumental in addressing challenges and uplifting rural communities, particularly through his leadership in the Rural Support Program.\nHe said since 1982, Shoaib Sultan Khan has played a transformative role in various impactful programs across Pakistan, India, and South Asia, positively impacting millions of lives.\nDuring the interactive session, a wide range of subjects dealing with rural support programs in Pakistan was discussed.\nThe topics including sustainable development of programs, political transitioning, harnessing people’s potential, inclusion of women, data sharing among departments, political will, and digitalization of the program came under discussion.\nIt was emphasized that the rural support program had proven its relevance and efficacy over time and that this vision remained relevant and sustainable, now and for the future.\nThe forum was attended by a large number of serving and former civil servants, academics, think tank experts, development practitioners, students, and members of civil society and the media.\nAmbassador Khalid Mahmood, Chairman, BoG ISSI, presented ISSI’s momento to the distinguished speaker.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
