It is suggested to install emergency doors and auto-lock doors in coaches in case of any emergency,” he added.\nThe official urged the citizens to stop at the level crossing before crossing the track, look on both sides of the track and wait for the train to pass if any train was coming.\nHe said that double whistle boards had been provided at most level crossings where train drivers were bound to play horns to warn the road users about train arrival.",
