  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 04 (APP):Hurriyet Leader, Abdul Hamid Lone on Sunday alleged that the Indian Occupant Forces in the Illegally Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (IIOJK) for perpetrating economic and ecological terrorism by depriving Kashmiris of economic opportunities, destruction of apple orchards and unbridled deforestation leading to decline in rain and snowfall and shift in local climate.\nAfter the revocation of the Article 35-A and 370 of the Indian Constitution that ripped off the occupied valley of the special status had developed a new situation in the IIOJK, Abdul Hameed Lone told APP in his exclusive chat in connection with the Kashmir Solidarity Day.\nLone said the Modi regime wanted to convert the IIOJK into a Hindutva State, transforming the Muslim majority into a minority in the state, and had issued domiciles to over five million non-state residents in IIOJK.\n“The social life has been badly disrupted as the Kashmiris have been deprived of their businesses, economy derailed, businesses destroyed, and youth have been impacted as their education has been disrupted,” he said.\nThe Hurriyet Leader added that the forest cutting was taking place at higher rates causing climate change and abnormal rainfall, whereas no snowfall occurred these winters in the IIOJK due to climate change.\nHe mentioned that the non-state residents were given lands on lease including Israel that have been issued hundreds of acres land. Moreover, the non-state residents were also given contracts in IIOJK while ignoring the local Kashmiris who have been deprived of their basic right of livelihood and business.\n“There have been townships and colonies created for the non-state residents to alter the demography of the IIOJK,” he said.\nIndia while resorting to illegal tactics, he added that had attempted to abolish Urdu as official language of IIOJK. “For the past 125 years, Urdu is the official language of Jammu and Kashmir whereas six other languages have been declared as official language including Dogra, Hindi, Kashmiri, Gojri, Pahari and Urdu in the IIOJK to abolish Urdu and Kashmiri as official languages and impose Hindi as a Hindu language,” he said.\n“It is clandestine design based on Chanakya’s ideology of India to impose Hindi as national language, whereas Kashmiri culture, customs and traditions have been completely trampled. One of the important department of Kashmir Academy of Letters is headed by Rahul Pandey who is a non-state resident whereas his wife is the secretary information of the governor and similarly many other non-state residents have been deputed in the occupied valley on important positions,” he said.\nThe IIOJK based (Kashmiri) civil servants, officers and SHOs (Station House Officers) in police stations have been replaced with non-state residents, he said.\nAbdul Hameed Lone underlined that the Kashmiri people were thankful to Pakistani nation and the government of Pakistan for their moral, political, diplomatic, and social support. “Once again Kashmir Solidarity Day is going to be marked across Pakistan which is the center of the fact that the Pakistanis and the government of Pakistan are standing beside the Kashmiris for their just right to self-determination and liberation from the clutches of Indian occupation,” he said.\nHe commented that on this Kashmir Solidarity Day, it would be reminded to the world and the Indian government that till the fulfilment of the goal of liberation and resolution of Kashmir dispute as per the aspirations of the Kashmiris, Pakistan will continue to extend its moral, political and diplomatic support to the just freedom movement.\nAfter August 5, 2019, he said the united Hurriyet leadership have been detained and thousands of youth were facing detentions in far flung jails of India in a very bad condition, adding, “They have no access to health facilities and no basic rights and they have been detained in fake cases and are placed with professional criminals in jail.”\nHe termed the Indian Public Safet Act as a draconian law under which the innocent Kashmiri youth and Hurriyet leadership was being arrested and the Indian Kangaroo courts were passing one-sided judgements. “It is an open enmity with the Kashmiris and the Indian Army and Courts are waging a war against Kashmiris and there is no hope from them for peace and justice for Kashmiris,” he added.\nHe reiterated that the Kashmiris leadership’s spirits are higher than Himalayas and India could not bar Kashmiris from their passion for freedom.\n“Indian occupant regime cannot silence us with bullets and under their guns. Kashmiri freedom struggle is a just movement and our fourth generation is facing I395ndian oppression and there is no example of the passion exhibited by Kashmiris struggling for freedom,” he added.\n“There is no freedom of speech and our democratic, fundamental, religious and human rights have been usurped. There is all opposite to the UN Human Rights Declaration in IIOJK and the women in IIOJK are used a tool by Indian forces to unleash fear and torture. Women are scared and they are living in this terror, but no power on earth can defeat Kashmiris. India should read this writing on the wall that it cannot alter the passion of Kashmiris for freedom with its violence,” he added.\nHe recommended that there was a for enhanced lobbying to flag Kashmir Issue at the international front and facilitate the Kashmiri diaspora for the cause. “We need to take the Kashmir issue vociferously at the UN, EU and the British Parliament forums.  Kashmir issue should be raised at the international educational institutions and global youth should be sensitised on the atrocities of the Indian occupant forces unfolding barbarism against innocent Kashmiris,” he added.\nLone noted that there were evidences to the human rights violations and abuses committed by the Indian forces and the Hurriyet Leadership would approach the International Court of Justice to prove that Indian Army and its officers were war criminals committing war crimes in IIOJK.\nHe also urged the Muslim Ummah to play its active part alongwith the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) which is the second largest forum after the United Nations to come forward and ardently fight the cases of innocent Kashmiris in IIOJK and poor Palestinians in Palestine facing genocide by occupant forces of India and Israel respectively.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
