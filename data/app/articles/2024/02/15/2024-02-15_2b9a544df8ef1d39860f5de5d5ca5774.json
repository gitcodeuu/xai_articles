  "content": "ISLAMABAD, Feb 15 (APP):The Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Thursday reserved its verdict in a petition challenging the decision of Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) for re-polling in six polling stations of NA-43 Tank.\nChief Justice Aamer Farooq heard the petition filed by independent candidate Dawar Khan Kundi against the ECP decision.\nThe petitioner’s lawyer Afnan Karim Kundi said that the voters’ turnover was low due to the security issues.\nHe said his client had defeated the son of Maulana Fazlur Rehman in the constituency, and Form 47 was issued. But the ECP ordered re-polling without receipt of any complaint, he added.\nThe lawyer prayed the court to set aside the ECP’s order for re-polling.\nThe ECP’s Director General Law adopted the stance that the body had received several complaints, some of them were disposed of while re-polling was ordered at some polling stations.\nIt was reported that the people did not cast their votes in the area, he added.\nThe court reserved the verdict after hearing arguments from the respondents.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
