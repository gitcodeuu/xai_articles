Pakistan rejects the Indian claims as fueled by hyper-nationalism with inflammation rhetoric, such claims pose threats to regional peace and stability.\nShe urged the Indian politicians to cease the practice of dragging Pakistan into their internal discourse aimed at gaining electoral motives.\nShe said that despite Indian rhetoric and assertions, IIOJK remained an internationally recognized disputed territory as the UN Security Council’s resolutions clearly outlined that final status would be determined by the will of the Kashmiri people through a free plebiscite.\n“India would be wise to help implement those resolutions instead of harboring delusion of grandeur,” she remarked.\nThe spokesperson also condemned the ongoing vilification, stigmatization and victimization of Muslims and other minorities in India.\nTo a question, Spokesperson Baloch said currently, there was no back channel diplomacy going on between Pakistan and India to normalize bilateral trade.\nApprising the media of the visit of Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi, she said during the interactions, both sides agreed to strengthen economic and cultural cooperation, turn the bilateral borders into borders of peace and cooperation, fast-track the negotiations on Free Trade Agreement and release each other’s prisoners.\nAsked about the Iran-Pakistan Gas Pipeline Project, she said it was discussed during President Raisi’s visit and also featured in the joint statement. She said Pakistan had significant energy needs and was exploring options for its import.\nShe said Pakistan had noted the statements from the US authorities about the Pakistan-Iran trade and was engaged with the US and discussed all aspects of the energy needs.\nShe told the media that a high-level delegation of China International Development Cooperation Agency (CIDCA) led by Chairman Luo Zhaohui visited Pakistan and met Prime Minister Shehbaz and other leadership wherein both sides agreed to accelerate the projects being executed under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.\nHighlighting the situation in Gaza and the discovery of two mass graves, Spokesperson Baloch called for investigation and fixing of responsibility for the Israeli war crimes, immediate and unconditional ceasefire, lifting of the siege and unhindered access to humanitarian aid.\nComing to the US Country Report on Human Rights Practices, the spokesperson reiterates the rejection as it had flawed methodology.",
