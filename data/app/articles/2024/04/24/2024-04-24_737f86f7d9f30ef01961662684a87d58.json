She added that macro-economic stability has to be ensured through adequate processes and reinforced with great commitment through significant revenue enhancement along with the focus on remote earnings to be aligned with an increase in its earning agenda.\nDr Akhtar underlined that the country had to abandon domestic and external debts with an improved taxation footprint and productivity improvements to achieve the goal of economic growth.\nDr Abid Qaiyum Suleri, the SDPI Executive Director, said the recommendations presented by the experts are identical to the domestic agenda for the economic betterment of the country.  He recommended that the country needs to fix the leakages in its economic system, the chronic menaces like state-owned enterprises that are damaging the national economy.\n“The country can’t avert default-like situation amid more economic compromises towards non-tax paying sectors,” he added. Moreover, Dr Suleri said, it is also necessary to advocate for IMF to review the impacts of its recommendations on people of Pakistan during its quarterly review and while assessing how it is impacting the lives of the common masses.\nKanni Wignaraja, the UN Assistant Secretary-General and UNDP Regional Director for Asia and the Pacific said the green economy is not a luxury but a living reality in the prevailing times, whereas many Asian countries have transformed their transport sector that indicated low subsidies on fuels and increased incentive for eco-friendly means.\n“It’s not the issue of behaviour change but the issue of access to technology to improve governance. For example, she said, universal access to Wi-Fi is imperative to ensure economic justice with infrastructure development whereas dignity is critical in the human development landscape.”\nMs Wignaraja said the tax subsidy equation in developing countries shows a direct correlation with more burdening of the already taxed and less inclusion of the untaxed sectors.\n“Pakistan’s debts go more into consumption than to increase productivity. However, we have to carry our own narrative and issues as Pakistan has to make its own choices to overcome the economic crisis. It has been dragging its debt for decades and should explore new opportunities and take its affairs and decisions into its own hands,” she added.\nPakistan should not import the things which are burdening the debt consumption she said, adding that the country needs a viable and single source of finance to address its economic woes.\nTobias Akhtar Haque, Lead Country Economist and Acting Country Director, WB-Pakistan said Pakistan needs to reduce its budgetary deficit to lessen debts and utilize resources for human and infrastructure development.\nHe added that Pakistan must have a balanced budget to create fiscal space for growth and economic recovery. “However, it is necessary to review fiscal exemptions and those with political motives should be closed to start taxing the untaxed sectors like real estate and large agricultural farmland owners,” he maintained.\nMr Haque said the subsidies provided to the energy, fertilizer and gas-based industries need to be abolished to ensure efficient movement of the economy and stop benefitting wrong people and support social development initiatives like the Benazir Income Support Programme (BISP).\nIn his closing remarks, Dr Abid Suleri extended the vote of thanks to UNDP and SDPI teams and the participants for making the session vibrant and interactive.\nHe said two myths to be broken that Pakistan is among the least emitters as there are around 100 more countries in this category and its ranking is 20th in terms of low Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions.\nIn terms of climate finance, Pakistan needs to explore private climate finances through an evidence-based approach and proper homework, he concluded.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
