ATC Judge Arshad Javed presided over the bail petitions of Azam Swati, who was also present during the proceedings.\nIn his bail petitions, Azam Swati stated that the police had falsely implicated him in six cases, including attacks on Jinnah House and Askari Tower, torching of  the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz office in Model Town, and police vehicles in Gulberg.\nHe expressed his intention to cooperate with the investigations to prove his innocence but expressed concern about potential police arrest. He requested bail from the court. The PTI leader had obtained protective bail from the Peshawar High Court to approach the court.\n(adsbygoogle=window.adsbygoogle||[]).push({});",
