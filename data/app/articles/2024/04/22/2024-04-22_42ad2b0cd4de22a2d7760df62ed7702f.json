Hence, we understand the urgency of taking bold and decisive steps to confront these challenges and build resilience in the face of adversity, he added.\nHe said the government was leading the charge and remained committed to making its contribution as it had initiated an exhaustive consultative process with the line ministries, provincial environment departments, ICT administration, industries and other relevant stakeholders for developing Single-Use Plastics (Prohibition) Regulations, 2023 as well as restriction on use of Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) bottles in federal ministries/divisions.\n“These initiatives underscore our commitment towards promoting a sustainable circular economy for plastics by reducing waste, and consumption, and encouraging reuse, recycling, and material recovery. To achieve a plastic-free society and effectively combat the escalating issue of plastic pollution in Pakistan, it is imperative to address the underlying causes and promote a holistic approach for managing plastic waste,” the prime minister remarked.\nHighlighting the role of provincial governments and local authorities as of prime importance, he urged the citizens to play their role in safeguarding the planet for the prosperity of all.\nRecounting nature’s bounties for Pakistan in the form of awe-inspiring mountains, dense forests and pristine lakes and coasts, he emphasised the society’s responsibility to protect them.\n“From preserving nature to mitigating the effects of climate change on people and their livelihoods, Pakistan will continue its strife towards building a sustainable, cleaner and greener future,” he resolved.",
