It had put the opposition leadership behind the bars in fabricated cases.\nHe further alleged that the PTI had managed to form governments at the federal level and in Punjab as a result of rigged elections in 2018.\nIts government failed to deliver on the promises the party had made during the election campaign, particularly regarding the construction of millions of houses and jobs creation.\nThe PPP leader urged the opposition to join hands with the government for the progress, prosperity, and development of the country. He emphasized on the importance of unity and collaboration among political parties for the betterment of Pakistan.",
