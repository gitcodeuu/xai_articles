If there was ever a time where we need to re-ignite our collective efforts, to be strong and united as partners, it is now.”\nDr Luo Dapeng, WHO Representative in Pakistan said, “An investment in polio eradication makes a huge difference to children not just in Pakistan, but the world.\n“As we move closer to polio eradication in Pakistan, it is critical that the ongoing support of partner and donor agencies continues so that the gains we have made can remain in place and we cross the finish line.”",
