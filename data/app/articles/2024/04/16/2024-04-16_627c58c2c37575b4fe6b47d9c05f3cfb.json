The agency has done a great deal of work in areas of health, education, employment, and promotion of cultural and trade ties between the US and Pakistan. USAID’s involvement as a partner in the NUST Technology Tower initiative will be of immense help.”\nHouston based Tanweer Ahmed announced last year in 2023 he will be donating $9 million to Islamabad’s National University of Science & Technology (NUST) to help students from poor backgrounds to gain access to quality education through scholarships.\nNUST has confirmed that Tanweer Ahmed and USAID have entered into a partnership with the university through an Endowment Fund for unprivileged students which will benefit nearly hundreds of students who would be able to get scholarships every year.\nLast month, President Asif Ali Zardari conferred Pakistan’s second highest civilian award “Hilal-e-Imtiaz” and “Pride of Pakistan” on Tanweer Ahmed for his services towards Pakistan’s development and helping Pakistan’s relations with the United States of America (USA).\nThe American-Pakistani businessman was awarded for his “services for Pakistan and its people, enhancing defence cooperation, strengthening of bilateral ties and contributions towards peace efforts in the region”.\nThe award citation said: “Tanweer Ahmed, who is based in the US, has played an important role in helping Pakistan’s educational, medical and social causes through his philanthropy.

You are a patriotic Pakistan and the nation salutes you.”\nLast year, the Indus University on the recommendation of Sindh’s governor conferred the honorary doctorate degree on Ahmed in acknowledgement of his services to the IT and health sectors in Pakistan.\nTanweer Ahmed, who made his fortune in the US food industry, said that only quality education can transform Pakistan into making Sam Altman, Larry Page and Elon Musk.\nTanweer Ahmed is an American-Pakistani businessman, investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist who works with major companies, not for profit organizations and hospitals.
